  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relative bioavailability and food effect of a&#xD;
      single dose of milvexian administered as direct compression (DC) oral tablets and roller&#xD;
      compacted (RC) oral tablets compared with milvexian administered as Phase 2 oral capsules&#xD;
      (Part 1) and of new concept tablets consisting of a single dose of milvexian administered as&#xD;
      oral Tablet 1 and Tablet 2 compared with milvexian administered as Phase 2 oral capsules&#xD;
      (Part 3) in healthy participants under fasting and fed conditions; to characterize the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of multiple twice daily (BID) doses for 5 days of milvexian&#xD;
      administered as DC oral tablets and Phase 2 oral capsules in healthy participants (Part 2)&#xD;
      and to assess the effects of dosing time and food timing on the PK of single-dose of&#xD;
      milvexian Phase 3 oral tablet formulation in healthy participants (Part 4).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, vital signs, and&#xD;
             12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at screening and on Day -1 of Treatment&#xD;
             Period 1. If there are abnormalities, the investigator may decide that the&#xD;
             abnormalities or deviations from normal are not clinically significant, in which case&#xD;
             the participant may be included&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index (BMI equals to [=] weight/height^2) between 18 and 30 kilograms per&#xD;
             meter square (kg/m^2) (inclusive), and body weight not less than 50 kg at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy on the basis of safety laboratory tests performed at screening and on Day -1&#xD;
             of Treatment Period 1. If the results of the safety laboratory tests are outside the&#xD;
             normal reference ranges, the participant may be included only if the investigator&#xD;
             judges the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically significant&#xD;
             except as specified in Exclusion Criteria 2. This determination must be recorded in&#xD;
             the participant's source documents and initialed by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A woman must have a negative highly sensitive serum (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin&#xD;
             [beta-hCG]) at screening and urine pregnancy test on Day 1 of Treatment Period 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Before randomization, a woman must be either: a) Not of childbearing potential defined&#xD;
             as: postmenopausal: A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months&#xD;
             without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level&#xD;
             greater than (&gt;) 40 international units per liter IU/L or milli-international units&#xD;
             per milliliter (mIU/mL) in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a&#xD;
             postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal replacement therapy (HRT), however in&#xD;
             the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient;&#xD;
             permanently sterile: Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral&#xD;
             salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy; b) Of childbearing potential and;&#xD;
             practicing a highly effective method of contraception (failure rate of less than [&lt;] 1&#xD;
             percent [%] per year when used consistently and correctly) for at least 3 months prior&#xD;
             to the study entry and; agrees to remain on a highly effective method of contraception&#xD;
             throughout the study and for at least 34 days after the last dose of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  During the study, a man who is sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential&#xD;
             or with a woman who is pregnant must agree to use a barrier method of contraception&#xD;
             (example, condom with spermicidal foam/gel/ film/cream/suppository)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of any known illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, might confound&#xD;
             the results of the study or pose an additional risk in administering study drug to the&#xD;
             participant or that could prevent, limit or confound the protocol-specified&#xD;
             assessments. This may include but is not limited to any known bleeding or clotting&#xD;
             disorder, a history of arterial or venous thrombosis, liver or renal dysfunction,&#xD;
             significant cardiac, vascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, endocrine, neurologic,&#xD;
             hematologic, rheumatologic, psychiatric, neoplasm, metabolic disturbances, or poor&#xD;
             venous access&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant abnormal values for hematology, coagulation, clinical&#xD;
             chemistry, or urinalysis at screening or on Day -1 of Treatment Period 1 as determined&#xD;
             by the investigator or appropriate designee. Any of the following laboratory results&#xD;
             outside of the normal ranges specified below at screening or Day -1 of Treatment&#xD;
             Period 1 which must be confirmed by repeat: Hemoglobin or hematocrit less than (&lt;)&#xD;
             lower limit of normal; Platelet count &lt; lower limit of normal; activated partial&#xD;
             thromboplastin time (aPTT) or prothrombin time (PT) &gt;1.2*upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any agent, including but not limited to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs&#xD;
             (NSAIDs), aspirin or other anti-platelet agents, anticoagulants, fish oil capsules,&#xD;
             ginkgo or any agent that can potentially increase the risk of bleeding within 14 days&#xD;
             prior to the first dose of study drug administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of any clinically significant drug or food allergies (such as anaphylaxis or&#xD;
             hepatotoxicity) and known allergy to the study drugs or any of the excipients of the&#xD;
