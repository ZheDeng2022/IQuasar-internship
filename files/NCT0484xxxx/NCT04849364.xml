    <textblock>
      This is a 3-arm study stratified by plasma ctDNA. Patients with residual TNBC disease after&#xD;
      pre-operative therapy will be assigned to 1 of 3 Arms based on plasma ctDNA positivity and&#xD;
      genomic marker(s).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants that are plasma ctDNA positive with a genomic target will be assigned to one of&#xD;
      the four groups in Arm 1 and receive genomically directed therapy for 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 1a: DNA Repair pathway = talazoparib + capecitabine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 1b: Immunotherapy pathway = atezolizumab + capecitabine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 1c: PI3K Pathway = inavolisib + capecitabine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 1d: DNA Repair + Immunotherapy = talazoparib + atezolizumab + capecitabine&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants that are plasma ctDNA positive without a genomic target will be assigned to Arm&#xD;
      2 and receive capecitabine or treatment of physician's choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants that are plasma ctDNA negative will be assigned to Arm 3 and receive any of the&#xD;
      following based on patient and physician decision: no therapy/observation, capecitabine or&#xD;
      treatment of physician's choice.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for release of personal health&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Residual invasive disease in the breast measuring at least 1 cm. The presence of&#xD;

             chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, mineralocorticoids (e.g. fludrocortisone) for&#xD;
             patients with orthostatic hypotension, and low dose supplemental corticosteroids (&lt;10&#xD;
             mg prednisone or equivalent) for adrenocortical insufficiency are allowed. Patients&#xD;
             with a history of allergic reaction to IV contrast requiring steroid pre-treatment&#xD;
             should have screening and subsequent tumor assessments performed using magnetic&#xD;
             resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of severe allergic, anaphylactic, or other hypersensitivity reactions to any&#xD;
             of the study medications being used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with any investigational agent within 30 days prior to study registration.&#xD;

          -  Type 2 diabetes requiring ongoing systemic treatment at the time of study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any concurrent ocular or intraocular condition (e.g., cataract or diabetic&#xD;
             retinopathy) that, in the opinion of the investigator, would require medical or&#xD;
             surgical intervention during the study period to prevent or treat vision loss that&#xD;
             might result from that condition&#xD;
