    <textblock>
      The Mindful Mood Balance for Moms (MMBFM) study examines whether using an internet program&#xD;
      called Mindful Mood Balance for Moms to deliver Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT)&#xD;
      over an 8-week time period, is effective for reducing depression symptoms among pregnant&#xD;
      women with a history of prior depression, and studies the effects of implementation&#xD;
      strategies on the reach of the MMBFM program. This study will enroll 470 women from Kaiser&#xD;
      Permanente Colorado, Southern California, Georgia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will compare clinical outcomes between those that receive mental health&#xD;
      clinician coaching and those that receive peer coaching throughout the 8-week program. Survey&#xD;
      data will be collected at 4 time points throughout the study (baseline, 12 weeks, 3rd&#xD;
      trimester, and 3 months postpartum). The cost-effectiveness of both the clinical and peer&#xD;
      coaching models at each health care system will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the implementation portion of the study, 30 OB clinics across the 4 health systems will&#xD;
      be randomized in equal numbers to provide clinician facing implementation strategies (e.g.,&#xD;
      recruitment flyers, script pads, electronic medical record prompts) to encourage engagement&#xD;
      in the MMBFM program or to usual care where women are only recruited by the study team with&#xD;
      no clinician involvement. The primary outcome for testing clinician facing implementation&#xD;
      strategies is reach, the percentage of women outreached who initially engage in the MMBFM&#xD;
      program.&#xD;

      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, a leading implementation&#xD;
      science framework, this hybrid type III effectiveness implementation study will evaluate&#xD;
      specific implementation strategies for MMBFM. Consistent with a hybrid type III study, there&#xD;
      are two goals: (1) compare the clinical effectiveness of MMBFM supported by mental health&#xD;
      clinician vs. peer coaches in a randomized trial of 470 pregnant women; and (2) compare the&#xD;
      reach of MMBFM across OB clinics for two sets of implementation strategies to facilitate&#xD;
      access to and initial engagement in MMBFM: patient facing strategies (PFS - direct outreach&#xD;
      to women following prenatal visits via secure patient portal, email, text, or mail) vs.&#xD;
      patient facing strategies combined with clinician facing strategies (PFS+CFS - Electronic&#xD;
      Medical Record (EMR)-embedded prompts for OB providers, printed prescription pads for&#xD;
      providers, flyers). A cluster randomized design will be used, randomizing 30 OB clinics&#xD;
      across 4 health systems to either of these two implementation conditions, to assess their&#xD;
      impact on reach. The investigators will address the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Compare the clinical effectiveness (i.e. engagement and symptom reduction) of MMBFM&#xD;
      supported by clinician vs. peer coaches among women with a history of prior depressive&#xD;
      episodes. Hypothesis 1: Coaching delivered by mental health clinicians vs. peers with lived&#xD;
      experience will be associated with equivalent reductions in depressive symptoms at 6 months&#xD;
      post-randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Examine specific mechanisms of action for MMBFM participants receiving clinician vs.&#xD;
      peer coaching. Hypothesis 2a: MMBFM participants receiving peer coaching will report less&#xD;
      self-stigma and social isolation than those receiving clinician coaching, and MMBFM&#xD;
      participants receiving clinician coaching will report less ruminative response to negative&#xD;
      affect and greater decentering at 6 months post-randomization than those receiving peer&#xD;
      coaching. Hypothesis 2b: Any difference between peer and clinician coaching in depression&#xD;
      outcomes will be mediated by treatment-specific targets - at least partially via increased&#xD;
      engagement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Examine the effects of specific implementation strategies on reach of the MMBFM&#xD;
      program. Hypothesis 3: Clinician facing implementation strategies (CFS) in combination with&#xD;
      patient facing strategies (PFS) will lead to higher rates of reach than patient facing&#xD;
      strategies alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: Estimate the cost-effectiveness of MMBFM supported by clinician vs. peer coaches.&#xD;
      Hypothesis 4: MMBFM will be more cost-effective when supported by peer vs. clinician coaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trials of implementation strategies at the individual and clinic levels will be conducted&#xD;
      at four health systems representing diversity in geographic location and in racial and ethnic&#xD;
      membership: Kaiser Permanente Colorado, Southern California, and Georgia, and HealthPartners&#xD;
      in Minnesota. These sites include 95 clinics and more than 400 obstetric clinicians (OB&#xD;
      physicians, nurse practitioners, midwives, nurses), providing prenatal care for 53,000 women&#xD;
      annually. The implementation trial for Aims 1 and 2 will recruit 470 women following prenatal&#xD;
      care visits total across the four health systems and randomize them in equal numbers to&#xD;
      participate in one of the two coaching arms for the MMBFM program, lasting 8 weeks. The&#xD;
      clinic-level implementation trial (Aim 3) will involve a cluster randomized design in which&#xD;
      30 OB clinics will be recruited from the four health systems and randomized in equal numbers&#xD;
      to either the PFS or PFS+CFS intervention arms, lasting 6 months. The individual- and&#xD;
      clinic-level trials will be conducted in parallel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 8-session MMBFM program teaches mindfulness practice and cognitive behavioral skills to&#xD;
      help reduce automatic, depressogenic modes of thoughts, emotions, and sensations. MMBFM is&#xD;
      delivered in a mobile first digital format, accessible from desktop or mobile devices, and&#xD;
      provided in an individually tailored manner that includes experiential practice, video-based&#xD;
      vicarious learning, and didactic information.&#xD;
