  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand how the use of whole genome sequencing (WGS) may&#xD;
      be able to increase the speed with which a diagnosis is made for patients in an intensive&#xD;
      care unit population. This is not an assessment of a new device, test, or technology. This&#xD;
      project is an investigation of the utility of this technology in clinical care when compared&#xD;
      to standard of care testing. The study will look at the ability to more quickly diagnose a&#xD;
      patient (time to diagnosis and efficacy of testing) as compared to standard of care testing.&#xD;
      The study will also look at the impact of WGS on patient outcomes and cost of clinical care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study to understand if the use of whole genome sequencing (WGS)&#xD;
      increases the speed to diagnosis and how clinical management is changed in an intensive care&#xD;
      population of neonates. This project utilizes approved genome sequencing methods at&#xD;
      CLIA-certified facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Neonate subjects who are eligible and whose parents consent to the study will undergo&#xD;
           blood sample which will be sent for WGS and bioinformatics analysis, filtering first&#xD;
           with a targeted panel of 1722 genes most likely to cause genetic disorders in the first&#xD;
           year of life, and then with a whole exome filter if no obvious diagnosis is determined&#xD;
           using the 1722 gene panel filter. Testing is completed in a CLIA-certified laboratory.&#xD;
           Pathogenic, likely-pathogenic, and variants of uncertain significance in genes related&#xD;
           the child's clinical features will be returned to the care team and to the parents in&#xD;
           the setting of genetic counseling for use in clinical decision making about management.&#xD;
           A report is added to the neonates EMR. Consent will include permission to access&#xD;
           financial records of the hospitalization, to compare costs and length-of-stay to matched&#xD;
           controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Parents of identified neonates who consent to the study for the for the purpose of trio&#xD;
           analysis will have samples collected which will undergo concurrent analysis with the&#xD;
           child to assist in determining the pathogenicity of variants in genomic sequencing.&#xD;
           Pathogenic and likely-pathogenic secondary findings in the ACMG 59 later-onset medically&#xD;
           actionable genes will be reported to the parents in the setting of genetic counseling&#xD;
           ONLY if the parents opt in to learn these results AND they are identified in the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Siblings of participating neonates, if needed for interpretation of the neonate's&#xD;
           genetic studies, will have samples collected for use in the genetic analysis. Pathogenic&#xD;
           and likely-pathogenic results in childhood-onset disorders will be reported to the&#xD;
           parents in the setting of genetic counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Historical controls will be identified and matched to study participants. Historical&#xD;
           controls will include infants in the ICU having a genetics consult ordered during their&#xD;
           initial admission over the prior 24 months. Matching between study participants and&#xD;
           matched controls will be performed using Propensity Scores. We will fit a logistical&#xD;
           regression model to the combined treatment and control groups, and will then use the&#xD;
           nearest neighbor matching to create matched pairs. The matching will help reduce bias&#xD;
           and increase power to detect true effects. These controls will only be used for the&#xD;
           fiscal and length of stay analyses; no genetic testing will be done on this cohort.&#xD;

             propensity score matching.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neonates: An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from&#xD;
             participating in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. Is not the biological parent of the identified neonate&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. There is no exclusion for parent participation. If the parent is less than 18&#xD;
                  years of age, however, these individuals will be asked to assent to the study and&#xD;
                  their parent(s) will be asked to provide permission/consent for the minor&#xD;
                  parent's participation&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Having had previous genetic testing does not exclude the parent from&#xD;
                  participating in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Siblings:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Is not a biological sibling of a neonate who meets the inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Is not require for accurate interpretation of neonate results&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Having had previous genetic testing does not exclude the sibling from&#xD;
                  participating in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Historical Control: Has not been seen within the past 24 months and/or does not meet&#xD;
             the criteria for matched control as defined by propensity score matching. Part of this&#xD;
             matching requires that the historical control be matched to a study participant based&#xD;
             on age, thus they will be selected based on all matching criteria and will be excluded&#xD;
             if they do not meet the criteria, including age.&#xD;
