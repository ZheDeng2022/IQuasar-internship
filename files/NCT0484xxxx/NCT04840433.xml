      The purpose of this study is to identify the prevalence, nature and location of lesions in&#xD;
      the GI tract that may contribute to iron deficiency anaemia and compare diagnostic yied of&#xD;
      the upper GI magnetic controlled capsule endoscopy with conventional gastroscopy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) affects 2-5% of men and post-menopausal women (1). It is&#xD;
      thought to occur as a consequence of gastrointestinal blood loss in the majority of cases.&#xD;
      Studies suggest that gastroscopy identifies a possible cause in 25-58 % and colonoscopy in&#xD;
      25-33 % of cases. Because pathologies in both upper and lower gastrointestinal tract occur&#xD;
      simultaneously in up to 26% of cases, current United Kingdom guidelines recommend both&#xD;
      gastroscopy and colonoscopy for patients with IDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wireless capsule endoscopy (CE) is a non-invasive form of endoscopy using a swallowable pill&#xD;
      camera which produces images which can be viewed as a video. It is used routinely in clinical&#xD;
      practice to examine the small bowel and colon and a role in upper GI investigation is&#xD;
      emerging. We have experience of upper GI capsule endoscopy in over 100 patients who have&#xD;
      declined conventional gastroscopy using a protocol involving positional change to move a&#xD;
      capsule around a water-filled stomach (Ching et al., submitted for publication. It is much&#xD;
      better tolerated than conventional endoscopy which requires oral or anal intubation, often&#xD;
      following the administration of intravenous sedation and analgesia and incurs a small risk of&#xD;
      perforation.Pathology in the small bowel was historically considered to account for only 5%&#xD;
      of all gastrointestinal causes of anaemia . Consequently, current guidelines recommend small&#xD;
      bowel capsule endoscopy only when IDA has recurred after treatment. However, it is accepted&#xD;
      that as many as 30 % of patients with IDA undergoing bidirectional endoscopy have no&#xD;
      significant abnormality identified, raising the possibility that the cause is located in the&#xD;
      small bowel. The studies which identified that only 5% of IDA was due to small bowel&#xD;
      pathology used radiological methods of small bowel imaging, before the advent of CE.&#xD;
      Meta-analyses now show significantly better diagnostic yields of CE compared to small bowel&#xD;
      radiology in patients with IDA (42% and 6%, respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although mostly performed in patients with recurrent or refractory (as opposed to first&#xD;
      presentation of) anaemia, CE studies show a diagnostic yield of small bowel pathology in 66%&#xD;
      and a tumour detection rate of as much as 10% . Even in patients of less than 50 years of&#xD;
      age, 5% of patients are found to have tumours. Given the uncertainties about which&#xD;
      pathologies cause anaemia, the failure to identify a cause using conventional bidirectional&#xD;
      endoscopy in 30% and the availability of a highly sensitive, well tolerated small bowel&#xD;
      investigative tool, our primary aim is to determine the incidence, nature and location of&#xD;
      pathology in the gastrointestinal tract by performing small bowel capsule endoscopy in&#xD;
      patients referred for gastroscopy and colonoscopy for the investigation of IDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to passage through the pylorus and small bowel, capsules can now be moved around the&#xD;
      stomach using a joystick-controlled robot magnet (Ankon Technologies, Shanghai, China). A&#xD;
      multicentre study using this device showed a 90% sensitivity in the detection of gastric&#xD;
      focal lesions compared to gastroscopy, irrespective of size or location of the lesion. We&#xD;
      have also demonstrated that the diagnostic ability of capsules moved around the stomach&#xD;
      either using simple patient positional change or external handheld magnets is comparable to&#xD;
      gastroscopy. Patient tolerance significantly favoured CE in these studies and no patient&#xD;
      suffered adverse effects. The diagnostic yield using magnetically assisted CE (MACE) of the&#xD;
      upper gastrointestinal tract will be compared with gastroscopy as a secondary outcome measure&#xD;
      in this study of patients with IDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, this study aims to report on the prevalence of lesions in entire gastrointestinal&#xD;
      tract by endoscopy in patients with IDA. This is novel as there has been no such study&#xD;
      reporting pan enteric pathology by endoscopy in unselected patients with iron deficiency&#xD;
      since the advent of CE in 2000. This is important because uncertainty about the likelihood&#xD;
      that certain upper gastrointestinal and colonic pathologies, such as oesophagitis, gastritis,&#xD;
      diverticulosis and colonic polyps, are the cause of IDA, is widely acknowledged. In up to 25%&#xD;
      of patients synchronous upper and lower GI pathologies are found on gastroscopy and&#xD;
      colonoscopy, but we are unsure of the rates and significance of synchronous small bowel&#xD;
      pathologies in those deemed to have a cause found on gastroscopy or colonoscopy. If there are&#xD;
      significant synchronous pathologies in the small bowel it may be that small bowel CE should&#xD;
      become part of first line investigation. Furthermore, should MACE prove to be sensitive in&#xD;
      upper GI pathology detection when compared to gastroscopy, it may have a role in&#xD;
      investigating the stomach and small bowel simultaneously.&#xD;
