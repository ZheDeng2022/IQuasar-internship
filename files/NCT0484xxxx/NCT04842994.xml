      Scientific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To assess if the use of IONM can decrease the rates of temporary RLN palsy after thyroid&#xD;
      cancer surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess if the use of IONM can decrease permanent RLN palsy rates in patients with&#xD;
           thyroid cancers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess voice parameters in patients with RLN palsy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients undergoing total thyroidectomy with or without central compartment neck&#xD;
      dissection, for thyroid cancers, will be eligible for participation. After confirmation of&#xD;
      eligibility and obtaining informed consent, all patients will undergo preoperative screening&#xD;
      procedures. Fibreoptic laryngoscopy (FOL) examination will be done to document function of&#xD;
      the vocal cords. Preoperative voiceevaluation, GRBAS voice scale assessment and Voice Related&#xD;
      Quality of Life (VR-QOL) assessment will be performed for all patients. Patients will then be&#xD;
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive IONM or not during surgery. Patients will be stratified&#xD;
      as per predefined stratification factors. After surgery, endpoint assessment of vocal cord&#xD;
      mobility will be done with a FOL study, by an assessor blinded to the randomization arm.&#xD;
      Voice evaluation, GRBAS scale assessment and VR QOL assessment will also be done. An event&#xD;
      will be defined as any vocal fold paresis/palsy. Patients without the event will be followed&#xD;
      up for 6 months while patients with the event will be followed up for 2 years to assess&#xD;
      recovery of vocal cord function and changes in speech parameters. All patients with vocal&#xD;
      cord paresis/palsy will be given speech and swallowing rehabilitation&#xD;

      Background and rationale of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of the thyroid carcinoma has dramatically increased in the last few&#xD;
      decades.1Total thyroidectomy with or without central compartment dissection is the treatment&#xD;
      of choice for thyroid carcinoma. Vocal cord palsy (VCP) due to injury to the recurrent&#xD;
      laryngeal nerve (RLN) is one of the most dreaded complications of this surgery. The symptoms&#xD;
      associated with this complication include hoarseness of voice, voice fatigue and aspiration.&#xD;
      Vocal cord palsy can be either temporary or permanent. The reported incidence of temporary&#xD;
      VCP varies from 0-12%.2-4 However, the incidence of permanent VCP has been reported to be&#xD;
      much lower varying from 0 to 3.5%.4,5Many patients may not present with symptoms of&#xD;
      hoarseness and a post-operative laryngoscopic examination is required in all patients who&#xD;
      have undergone surgery for thyroid cancer.6 However, the morbidity associated with VCP&#xD;
      significantly affects the quality of life of the patient and at times require intervention to&#xD;
      prevent aspiration or to improve voice quality.7 In a recent publication from our institute&#xD;
      the invesigator found a temporary VCP rate of 11.8%.8&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra operative nerve monitoring (IONM) is a technique of monitoring the RLN during surgery,&#xD;
      to help identification and safe guarding of the nerve during total thyroidectomy as well as&#xD;
      central compartment clearance (CCC). This is a well established technique with many centers&#xD;
      in the world routinely using monitoring during surgery. There have been 4 RCTs and 2 meta&#xD;
      analysis looking at the role of IONM in decreasing RLN palsy after thyroidectomy. The results&#xD;
      from the same have been equivocal with 3 of 4 RCTs showing no added benefit in decreasing RLN&#xD;
      palsy rates with the use of IONM.9-12 Of the 2 meta analysis, there was a decrease in RLN&#xD;
      palsy rates in one of the meta analysis. 13 however the other Meta analysis by Higgins et al&#xD;
      showed no improvement in RLN palsy rates with the use of IONM.14 In the meta analysis by Yang&#xD;
      et al, published in 2016, there was a 44% (p=ns) decrease in temporary RLN palsy rates in the&#xD;
      thyroid cancer cohort. However, the literature on use of IONM is still equivocal in&#xD;
      literature. The other issue with available literature on use of IONM is that, most studies&#xD;
      have looked at a heterogenous population of patients being operated for benign and malignant&#xD;
      disease. Also most patients in the series evaluated have been patients who have undergone&#xD;
      surgery for benign multinodular goiters. The extent of RLN dissection in these patients is&#xD;
      limited as compared to patients undergoing surgery for thyroid cancers which involve total&#xD;
      thyroidectomy and central compartment dissections. There have been no RCTs looking at the&#xD;
      role of IONM in preventing RLN palsy in thyroid cancer surgeries. Also none of the RCTs&#xD;
      performed have had a formal sample size calculation and robust analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Section B: Aims and Objectives Aim: To assess the role of IONM in thyroid cancer surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To assess if the use of IONM can decrease the rates of temporary RLN palsy after thyroid&#xD;
      cancer surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess if the use of IONM can decrease permanent RLN palsy rates in patients with&#xD;
           thyroid cancers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess voice parameters in patients with RLN palsy&#xD;
