      To evaluate the single dose pharmacokinetic profile ANAWIDOW [antivenin latrodectus (black&#xD;
      widow) equine immune F(ab´)2] lyophilized powder for solution 10 mL (dose: 3x10 mL vials) for&#xD;
      intravenous use of Laboratorios Silanes, S.A. de C.V. in healthy adult human male and female&#xD;
      subjects under fasting conditions. To assess the safety of single dose of ANAWIDOW [antivenin&#xD;
      latrodectus (black widow) equine immune F(ab´)2] lyophilized powder for solution 10 mL (dose:&#xD;
      3x10 mL vials) for intravenous use in healthy adult human male and female subjects under&#xD;
      fasting conditions. In a minimum of 12 healthy adult. In this study, all subjects will be&#xD;
      required to fast overnight for at least 10.00 hours prior to dosing at least 04.00 hours&#xD;
      post-dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, 3 ANAWIDOW 10 mL vials (3x10 mL) will be administered after diluting with&#xD;
      normal saline solution up to 50 mL as intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. The solution will&#xD;
      be infused through a 20-gauge catheter placed in the subject's left or right hand antecubital&#xD;
      fossa at room temperature under fasting conditions.&#xD;
