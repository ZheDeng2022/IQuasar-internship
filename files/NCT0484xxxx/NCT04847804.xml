      Infectious diseases pose a threat to the life of individuals worldwide. The pandemic has&#xD;
      highlighted the need to develop an innovative and cost- effective large population-based&#xD;
      screening methodology. The investigators propose a two-fold improvement barcode-labeled&#xD;
      testing strategy specifically for pooled samples. This platform combines isothermal&#xD;
      amplification and real-time electrochemical detection; electroactive modified loop probes&#xD;
      will be used in the amplification step for barcode readout. This method enables four samples&#xD;
      pooled detection at the same time. This platform will be integrated into a disposable&#xD;
      microfluidic chip that allows minimal human intervention during the process to realize a&#xD;
      massively parallel screening platform for infectious disease pathogens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To develop a sensing method for concurrent electrochemical-tag coded isothermal&#xD;
           amplification and real-time electrochemical detection;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To design a molecular strategy to barcode four individual samples so that they can be&#xD;
           pooled together and to simultaneously amplify and identify a positive individual, if&#xD;
           any, from the pooled sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To fabricate a microfluidic device integrating the sample processor and barcoding module&#xD;
           with the nucleic acid amplification and detection step for large-scale population&#xD;
           screening of up to 100 individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To validate the performance of the prototype using clinical specimens and benchmark it&#xD;
           against the detection data from commercially available testing equipment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rapid host-to-host transmissions coupled with the ease of international travel has led to&#xD;
      epidemics such as H5N1, H5N5, SARS, and, most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic. Traditional&#xD;
      epidemic control measures, such as contact tracing and physical isolation, are paramount to&#xD;
      mitigate the extent of disease spread at the early stage of the pandemic and these strategies&#xD;
      depend on the accuracy and speed of diagnosing suspected patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Now the gold standard for pathogen detection is nucleic acid detection via polymerase chain&#xD;
      reaction (PCR). However, this strategy is limited by the turnaround time, expensive PCR&#xD;
      machine, and potential number of infections. Thus, other isothermal amplification methods are&#xD;
      often used to circumvent the need for extra instrumentation and speed up the whole detection&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One approach to improve infectious disease screening efficiency is the popular Dorfman&#xD;
      testing, where samples are pooled together and tested at the same time to reduce the total&#xD;
      number of tests performed. However, the Dorfman testing is limited to low prevalence&#xD;
      population and has reduced sensitivity; Barcoding strategy has also been introduced to solve&#xD;
      pooling sample test. In 2020, Schmid-Burk and his colleagues combined LAMP and barcoding&#xD;
      which successfully developed COVID-19 from 100,000 pooled samples. However, the need of a&#xD;
      expensive next-generation sequencer limits its widespread use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed platform aims at development of a multistep process in one device, and the&#xD;
      capability of identifying the source of positive signals from pooled samples. The proposed&#xD;
      design will take advantage of a barcoding strategy to tag multiple sources of analytes prior&#xD;
      to pooling, a combination of isothermal amplification and sequence-specific electrochemical&#xD;
      detection, and the integration of several steps in one simple device. The research project&#xD;
      methodology will be divided into three parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) To develop an isothermal amplification method and real-time detection using&#xD;
      electroactive-labelled loop oligonucleotide probes&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have recently conceptualized a method, for which the investigators have&#xD;
      filed a US provisional patent protection. This new technique performs the isothermal&#xD;
      amplification and electrochemical detection of amplicons simultaneously based on&#xD;
      Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). The proposed scheme involves a one-pot&#xD;
      amplification and detection system in which an electrochemical reporter is attached to one of&#xD;
      the primers and a nicking enzyme is added to cleave the reporter only when amplification&#xD;
      occurs. In one reaction, a template DNA is designed to have two pairs of primer binding&#xD;
      sites: an outer pair of forward and backward primers (FP and BP) and an inner pair of&#xD;
      primers, namely, an electrochemically labeled loop probe (LP) and an assistant probe (AP).&#xD;
      The FP and LP bind to the same strand of the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) template while the&#xD;
      BP and AP bind to the opposite strand. The LP contains an electroactive label at the 5' end&#xD;
      and a 3' overhanging segment complementary to the target DNA sequence. The stem region&#xD;
      contains the recognition sequence of a nicking enzyme, but a mismatch is introduced to the&#xD;
      last nucleotide so that it will not be cleaved without the presence of the target DNA. The&#xD;
      start of the reaction is similar to ordinary LAMP, a double-loop amplicon can be produced,&#xD;
      and the reaction can come into the double loop amplification stage. Each of the double-loop&#xD;
      amplicons can be regarded as a signal amplification unit. Once the labeled LP is combined&#xD;
      with the amplicon and form a cleavage site that can be recognized by the nick enzyme, an&#xD;
      electroactive label can be released, and an electrochemical signal will be generated. The&#xD;
      preliminary results indicate that the strategy is able to detect up to 0.1 fg/μL,&#xD;
      corresponding to around 10 copies/μL of the input DNA, by using a methylene blue&#xD;
      electroactive reporter on four-array screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCEs) within 30 min.&#xD;
      The succeeding steps include incorporating a reverse transcription step for the detection of&#xD;
      RNA samples and testing the system in complex matrices to mimic actual biological fluids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) To design a molecular strategy to barcode four individual samples so that they can be&#xD;
      pooled together and to simultaneously amplify and identify the positive individual, if any,&#xD;
      from the pooled sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By designing four barcode sequences, the investigators are able to construct tagged cDNA&#xD;
      products through reverse transcription by BST enzyme. Thermolabile exonuclease I is added to&#xD;
      digest unreacted single strand barcode primers. In addition, the cDNA-RNA duplex product is&#xD;
      digested by RNase H to yield a single-stranded cDNA (ID-template).The pooled mixture of&#xD;
      ID-templates is amplified through the same process described in the previous section. Only&#xD;
      those samples with the RNA virus will generate positive electrochemical signals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this part, the investigators will use synthesis virus RNA or commercial extracted virus&#xD;
      total RNA as a detection template. The spiked samples can be mocked by mixing with human deep&#xD;
      throat saliva or nasopharyngeal swabs from healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iii) To fabricate a microfluidic device to integrate the sample processor and barcoding&#xD;
      module with the nucleic acid amplification and detection step for large-scale population&#xD;
      screening&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, the investigators design a simple and easy-to-use microfluidic pen-like&#xD;
      device that integrates the steps of sample preparation, barcoding, and amplification and&#xD;
      detection. It uses piston propulsion to provide power to push the sample into different&#xD;
      chambers. First, the mock samples are added into a sample loading chamber where the lysis&#xD;
      buffer is stored. A mixture of surfactin, SDS, and ethanol allows the rapid extraction of&#xD;
      viral nucleic acid, which is then injected down to the identification chamber containing the&#xD;
      freeze-dried BST polymerase and ID-tag primer mixture. The temperature will remain at 37&#xD;
      °C-50°C for reverse transcription. Then, the sample is injected to the chamber containing&#xD;
      thermolabile exonuclease I. The heating block is then set to 65 °C for 5 min to deactivate&#xD;
      the enzyme. Thereafter, the four samples are pooled together and injected into an&#xD;
      electrochemical detection chip below the microfluidic pen. Each chip contains four sets of&#xD;
      primers and LPs with different electroactive reporters with non-overlapping redox potentials&#xD;
      to trigger the amplification reaction in the presence of respective participant's ID&#xD;
      sequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The detection chamber sits atop a multichannel electrochemical workstation, which consists of&#xD;
      a connection port between the electrochemical sensor and detector, a circuit board, and a&#xD;
      power line for external display. The circuit board is mainly composed of a microcontroller&#xD;
      unit, a digital-to-analog converter, and a potentiostat module to allow for differential&#xD;
      pulse voltammetry analysis and simultaneously obtain the signals from an array of electrodes&#xD;
      and thereby detect a total of 100 samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iv) To validate the performance of the prototype using a clinical specimen and benchmark it&#xD;
      against the detection data from commercially available testing equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed method of pooled sample testing will be compared with the gold standard RT-PCR&#xD;
      test in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive&#xD;
      value, and accuracy. After demonstrating the validity of the results obtained from the&#xD;
      proposed pooling strategy, the investigators will then explore the possibility of using&#xD;
      saliva and mouth gargle samples in lieu of the nasopharyngeal swabs. Patients will be&#xD;
      recruited from the Prince of Wales Hospital for collection of respiratory samples to&#xD;
      determine the accuracy of this device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participants' medical records to collect clinical data, including age, sex, number of&#xD;
           days after the onset of symptoms, epidemiological exposure to people with confirmed&#xD;
           COVID-19 disease, severity (mild, moderate, severe, or critical), and the presence of&#xD;
           comorbidities will be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. SARS-CoV-2 PCR results of the participants from hospital electronic record will be&#xD;
           retrieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Nasopharyngeal swab, deep throat saliva, and/or mouth gargle sample from each recruited&#xD;
           patient will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Laboratory procedures and data analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sample preparation The samples collected from the 200 patients will firstly be divided&#xD;
           for two sets with similar prevalence, and each sample size is 100. The first set 100&#xD;
           samples will be extracted by using commercial viral RNA extraction kits provided by&#xD;
           HKUST, and then be stored for further RT-qPCR analysis and the LAMP-based method&#xD;
           verification.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. RT-qPCR assay To prepare RT-qPCR result as the reference, the extracted samples from&#xD;
           mentioned above will be analyzed using RT-qPCR for the qualitative and quantitative&#xD;
           detection of nucleic acid from the SARS-CoV-2, and a negative, a positive and a blank&#xD;
           control experiment should be included. The cycle thresholds (Ct) values, qualitative and&#xD;
           quantitative results of each sample will be recorded. The RT-qPCR procedures will be&#xD;
           followed by existing CDC-recommended guidelines. The qPCR primer and Taqman probe sets,&#xD;
           and SARS-CoV-2 RNA standard reference will be provided by HKUST.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pooled sample experiments The second set 100 inactivated samples will be divided into 25&#xD;
           groups randomly (each for 4 samples), and the investigators will perform SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
           group testing for the 25 pools using the microfluidic device developed above with HKUST&#xD;
           researchers. Based on the RT-qPCR results, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive&#xD;
           and negative predictive values will be calculated for further data analysis by HKUST.&#xD;
&#xD;
