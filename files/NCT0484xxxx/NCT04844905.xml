  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a cluster-randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the additive&#xD;
      benefit of Ivermectin (IVM) (or Placebo) mass drug administration (MDA) to&#xD;
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) MDA for malaria control in a moderate to low&#xD;
      malaria-endemic setting as an adjunctive strategy to existing programmatic malaria control&#xD;
      measures. The regime of DP and IVM will target both human reservoirs of Plasmodium falciparum&#xD;
      and the Anopheles gambiae vector respectively, with the aim of interrupting transmission. The&#xD;
      trial will be conducted on the Bijagos Archipelago, where islands (clusters) will be&#xD;
      randomised to receive seasonal DP and IVM or DP and Placebo MDA. The primary outcome will be&#xD;
      the prevalence of infection with Plasmodium falciparum in all age groups detected by nucleic&#xD;
      acid amplification testing during the peak malaria transmission season after two years of&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this trial are&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the impact of adjunctive IVM to DP MDA on malaria transmission in&#xD;
           communities with high ITN coverage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the impact of IVM MDA on An. gambiae population density and age-structure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the impact of IVM MDA on the prevalence of co-endemic IVM-susceptible&#xD;
           Neglected Tropical Diseases (lymphatic filariasis, soil transmitted helminths and&#xD;
           scabies)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate acceptability, feasibility and access to MDA as a strategy for malaria&#xD;
           control and to identify the most acceptable way of achieving and sustaining high&#xD;
           coverage MDA with IVM and DP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This cluster-randomized placebo-controlled trial has two arms. A total of 24 clusters will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to receive DP + IVM MDA or DP+ Placebo MDA using computer-generated random&#xD;
      numbers. To mitigate against contamination effects, the majority of clusters will be separate&#xD;
      islands and will be separated by distances greater than 2km. On the two islands that are&#xD;
      divided (each into two clusters), a buffer zone of 2km between each cluster will be ensured.&#xD;
      The total population of the archipelago is 24,000. The investigators will ensure balance&#xD;
      between trial arms with respect to population size, baseline Plasmodium falciparum prevalence&#xD;
      and access to health care. All clusters will receive the standard programmatic malaria&#xD;
      control interventions implemented by the National Malaria Control Programme which includes&#xD;
      insecticide-treated nets (ITN), intermittent preventative treatment in pregnancy (IPTp),&#xD;
      seasonal malarial chemoprophylaxis (SMC) for children aged 3-59 months and case diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment (CDT) with Artemether-lumefantrine.&#xD;

    <masking_description>An independent statistician will randomize the clusters to DP+IVM or DP+Placebo. The Placebo is identical in size, shape and colour and packaging. An independent pharmacist at Medical Research Council Unit The Gambia @ London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine will label the IVM and Placebo according to the statistician's designation and maintain the masking from all other investigators. Specifically generated masking codes will be generated and saved in three separate encrypted locations securely. Only the statistician and the pharmacist will have access to the encryption key.</masking_description>
