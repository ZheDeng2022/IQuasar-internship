  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To prospectively evaluate the technical success rate of real-time computed&#xD;
      tomography/CT/magnetic resonance imagingMR and -ultrasound (CT/MRI-US) automatic fusion&#xD;
      system and the long-term therapeutic efficacy of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) guided by&#xD;
      automatic fusion in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RFA is one of commonly used local therapies for primary or secondary liver tumors. For&#xD;
      successful and safe procedure, safe route of electrode and lesion visibility are essential&#xD;
      for RFA, and the conditions are usually evaluated on pre-RFA planning ultrasonography (USG).&#xD;
      However, RFA is sometimes aborted due to limited sonic window of various cause and&#xD;
      challenging identification of small isoechoic tumors or hepatocellular carcinomas among&#xD;
      dysplastic nodules . Therefore, precise targeting and assuring safe route would be of&#xD;
      clinical importance. In this preliminary study, investigators attempted to determine&#xD;
      automatic US and CT/MR fusion technique would be able to improve RFA feasibility in patients&#xD;
      with liver tumors.&#xD;
