  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to assess the effectiveness of the IlluminOss pelvic implants in&#xD;
      patients with pelvic metastatic disease presenting with pain, risk of pathologic fracture,&#xD;
      non-displaced or minimally displaced pathologic fracture of the pelvis, and geriatric&#xD;
      patients with pelvic fragility fractures. Results from this study will be used to confirm&#xD;
      preliminary clinically and possibly statistically significant reductions in pain and&#xD;
      improvements in function among these patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The matrix morphology of the tumors in metastatic bone disease (MBD) may be of blastic,&#xD;
      lytic, or mixed characteristics. Cancers of purely lytic or mixed blastic-lytic composition&#xD;
      are the most concerning, as they result in local destruction of the cortical and trabecular&#xD;
      bone, causing significant pain and increasing the risk of a pathologic fracture. Function and&#xD;
      mobility are severely affected in this patient population due to mechanical and oncogenic&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prophylactic fixation of impending pathological fractures from MBD has demonstrated&#xD;
      significant clinical benefit in terms of reducing mechanical pain and in decreasing the&#xD;
      progression to complete pathologic fracture as well as minimizing the symptoms when these&#xD;
      occur. In the later clinical scenario, the degree of fracture displacement, pain and&#xD;
      functional limitation in most cases is minimal as the fracture is an already treated&#xD;
      condition. In terms of surgical impact to the patient, prophylactic fixation is a faster&#xD;
      procedure with lower blood loss rates. Other benefits include, shorter length of&#xD;
      hospitalization and higher likelihood of discharge to home, in addition to reduction of pain,&#xD;
      improvement in activities of daily living, and better quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importantly, efforts have been made to predict fracture risk and the need for prophylactic&#xD;
      fixation based upon the clinical and radiographic features of MBD. This is well stablished in&#xD;
      long bones of the extremities but it is not as clear or conclusive in the pelvis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, Intramedullary devices are used for the purposes of prophylactic fixation and&#xD;
      for treatment of pathologic fractures. Advantages include protection of the whole bone and&#xD;
      ability to early bear weight given the biomechanical characteristics as a load sharing&#xD;
      device. More commonly, these implants are made of titanium or other metal alloys. In recent&#xD;
      years, the development of radiolucent implants has been important in orthopaedic oncology as&#xD;
      these facilitate evaluation of bone involvement and radiation therapy planning. One of these&#xD;
      radiolucent devices is IlluminOss PBSS. This UV light activated polymer has proved to be&#xD;
      effective and safe in the treatment of impending pathologic fractures of the humerus. This&#xD;
      intramedullary implant is inserted through small incisions and proved to be as effective as&#xD;
      traditional intramedullary nails in relieving pain and returning patients faster to their&#xD;
      pre-impending fracture level of activity. This product has been cleared by the FDA for use in&#xD;
      the humerus, radius and ulna, clavicle, pelvis, fibula, metacarpals, metatarsals, and&#xD;
      phalanges. The IlluminOss Photodynamic Bone Stabilization System can also be used in&#xD;
      conjunction with FDA-cleared fracture fixation systems to provide supplemental fixation in&#xD;
      these anatomic sites. The IlluminOss System may be used in the femur and tibia to provide&#xD;
      supplemental fixation to an anatomically appropriate FDA-cleared fracture fixation system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pelvic fractures in the elderly are a growing concern as the population ages. While&#xD;
      oftentimes treated non-operatively, some require surgical fixation. In addition to the stress&#xD;
      which surgery especially puts on geriatric patients, a return to pre-injury mobility is also&#xD;
      an important impact and a concern of such procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contrary to the extremities, there are minimal options for small incision pelvic implants to&#xD;
      treat patients suffering from pain or fracture. The complex anatomy of the pelvis does not&#xD;
      allow the use of rigid and precontoured implants. Fixation with screws is also challenging&#xD;
      given the complex anatomy and high prevalence of vital neurovascular structures in the&#xD;
      pelvis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The non-rigid nature of this polymer in the IlluminOss PBSS makes it suitable to adapt to the&#xD;
      complex anatomy of the pelvis. In addition, there is no need to use screws for additional&#xD;
      fixation, which is ideal in the pelvis. This implant may allow surgeons to forego the use of&#xD;
      screws for fixation because the implant has a 3D anti-rotational profile which generates&#xD;
      intrinsic stability when in contact with the inner bone. However, if the surgeon considers&#xD;
      that stability is not sufficient, screws may still be used in this study at the surgeon's&#xD;
      discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This device has been approved to be used in the pelvis after the experience in a previous&#xD;
      study examining its effectiveness in the humerus, radius, and ulna. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to collect information to effectively measure the improvement in pain control through&#xD;
      functional scores after the surgery. We wish to see short term results (2 years) and to have&#xD;
      a better understanding of the complication profile.&#xD;
