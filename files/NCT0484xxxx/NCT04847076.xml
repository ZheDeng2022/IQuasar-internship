    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary&#xD;
      effectiveness of &quot;What Were We Thinking&quot; (WWWT) a psychoeducational intervention -delivered&#xD;
      remotely via communication technologies- to prevent symptoms of postpartum depression and&#xD;
      anxiety in new mothers; which has been shown to be effective in primary health settings. WWWT&#xD;
      was developed in Australia and has been culturally adapted to be used in Chile. The m-health&#xD;
      version of the Chilean adaptation of WWWT for the current study includes: Psychoeducational&#xD;
      modules on issues relevant to mothers during the post-partum period; contact with the program&#xD;
      facilitator through instant messaging services available on mobile phones and a virtual group&#xD;
      meeting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will use a mixed design. The quantitative component will consist of a&#xD;
      before-after design with control group including 90 adult mothers of child aged 6-8 weeks who&#xD;
      receive health care in a primary health centers in Santiago, Chile. Mothers will be&#xD;
      randomized into the experimental (EG) or control groups (CG) in a rate of 1:1. Both EG and CG&#xD;
      will receive usual treatment provided by primary health centers (TAU), and only de EG will&#xD;
      receive the m-health adapted version of the WWWT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The qualitative component considers 12 users semi-structured interviews. The maximum&#xD;
      variation sampling strategy will be used according to the completion of m-health version of&#xD;
      WWWT. An open coding of Grounded Theory will be used to data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility of m-health version of WWWT intervention will be evaluated in terms of&#xD;
      eligibility rates, recruitment rates and reasons for study refusals, feasibility to deliver&#xD;
      the three components of the intervention, data attrition and follow-up rates by treatment&#xD;
      condition. Their acceptability considers participant completion of the intervention rates,&#xD;
      and a qualitative assessment of the users' acceptability of and satisfaction. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes will include changes on maternal levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms, maternal&#xD;
      self-efficacy and perceived social support. And differences in mother-infant quality of&#xD;
      interaction between intervention and control groups.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mental health symptoms are common in new mothers. Despite the availability of effective&#xD;
      screening and referral in the primary health system in Chile, very few women access treatment&#xD;
      due to diverse barriers (i.e., long waiting lists and insufficient knowledge about postnatal&#xD;
      depression and treatment). This highlights the importance of using a preventive approach.&#xD;
      Currently in Chile there are no universal preventive interventions, although they are&#xD;
      available internationally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, this study seeks to assess if it's feasible and acceptable to offer an alternative&#xD;
      intervention that can be delivered remotely by mobile phones, to support women in the early&#xD;
      postpartum period by promoting confidence and reducing distress in first time mothers. By&#xD;
      doing so, it will increase the number of available interventions to promote and prevent&#xD;
      children´s early adverse experiences related to maternal mental health problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study accounts for the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary effectiveness of &quot;What&#xD;
      Were We Thinking&quot; (WWWT) a psychoeducational intervention -delivered remotely via&#xD;
      communication technologies- to prevent symptoms of postpartum depression and anxiety in new&#xD;
      mothers. WWWT was developed in Australia and has been culturally adapted to be used in Chile.&#xD;
      The m-health version of the Chilean adaptation of WWWT includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Psychoeducational information for understanding and managing infant behavior and about&#xD;
           parenting. Modules on understanding and managing infant behavior include information on:&#xD;
           infant temperament, including such as differences in the reactivity, responsivity and&#xD;
           regulation of young infants; amount and known and unknown reasons for infant crying;&#xD;
           stimulation, over-stimulation and soothing; infant sleep needs and optimal sleep habits;&#xD;
           the use of settling strategies to achieve these while supporting breastfeeding; and&#xD;
           establishing sustainable routines of daily care: the feed, play, sleep routine. Modules&#xD;
           on matters relating to parents include: gendered differences in the losses and gains of&#xD;
           parenthood; differences in emotional needs and the potential for adverse reproductive&#xD;
           events to have lasting psychological effects on women after the birth of a baby; and&#xD;
           developing strategies to assist couples to address these in a non-confrontational&#xD;
           manner. This information will be delivered through instant messaging services for mobile&#xD;
           phones (i.e., Whatsapp) 3 times a week for four-week period. Each module will include a&#xD;
           very brief video offering information regarding a specific topic, a proposed personal&#xD;
           exercise and the invitation to assess the perceived usefulness of the information&#xD;
           received. Some modules include links to external, complementary information from the&#xD;
           Chilean Infancy Policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Contact with the program trained facilitator. It will allow mothers to ask questions&#xD;
           that arise from the topics addressed in the psychoeducational videos and share their&#xD;
           personal experiences. The facilitator responses will focus on aiding the understanding&#xD;
           and elaboration of the contents. This will be done through instant messaging service for&#xD;
           mobile phones (i.e., Whatsapp). In the present study, the facilitator will be a mental&#xD;
           health professional of the research team, that has been trained on the intervention&#xD;
           model.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Group virtual meeting. A virtual group meeting will take place with mothers and their&#xD;
           partners (or significant others) and the program facilitator. The group meeting seeks to&#xD;
           offer an instance were new mothers and fathers can share their experiences regarding&#xD;
           their parenthood and the changes it has involved in their daily lives, as well as&#xD;
           providing the opportunity for developing support networks among them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will use a mixed design. The quantitative component will consist of a&#xD;
      before-after design with control group including 90 adult mothers of child aged 6-8 weeks who&#xD;
      receive health care in a primary health centers in Santiago. Mothers will be randomized into&#xD;
      the experimental (EG) or control groups (CG) in a rate of 1:1. Mothers in the EG will receive&#xD;
      the m-health version of WWWT intervention plus the usual treatment that primary health&#xD;
      centers (TAU) provided to children. Participants in the CG will be subject to TAU. TAU for&#xD;
      children under one year of age include routine health checks by health professionals (nurse&#xD;
      or doctor), every month from 0 to 4 months of age, and at 6, 8 and 12 months of age. The&#xD;
      objective of the routine health care check is to carry out a comprehensive evaluation of the&#xD;
      child's development and growth, guide parents and caregivers regarding child development,&#xD;
      health and upbringing of the child. Also, promoting exclusive breastfeeding, healthy&#xD;
      mother/child bonding (by detecting relevant alterations in this area) and encouraging&#xD;
      paternal participation in upbringing and care of the child. Finally, in the health check-ups&#xD;
      at 2 and 6 months of age of the child, Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale is used for&#xD;
      screening depressive symptoms in mothers. At risk cases are referred for mental health&#xD;
      assessment and care. A waiting list procedure will allow the delivery of the intervention to&#xD;
      control women once the data collection for the study has been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participating mothers will be contacted in coordination with the health providers of two&#xD;
      public primary health centers after the first newborn health check. All women who meet the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria will be contacted by the research assistant to participate of the research&#xD;
      project. Women who wish to participate will be randomly assigned to the EG or CG. Both groups&#xD;
      will receive informed consent and will be assessed regarding sociodemographic&#xD;
      characteristics, mother's symptoms of anxiety and depression, maternal self-efficacy and&#xD;
      perceived social support. The participants in both groups will be assessed a week before the&#xD;
      start of the intervention (baseline) and three months after its completion (follow-up). After&#xD;
      the intervention is completed, the qualitative component of the study will be carried out to&#xD;
      access of the users' acceptability and satisfaction. It considers 12 semi-structured&#xD;
      interviews to members of the EG group. The maximum variation sampling strategy will be used&#xD;
      according to the completion of the intervention. An open coding of Grounded Theory will be&#xD;
      used to data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility of m-health version of WWWT will be evaluated in terms of eligibility rates,&#xD;
      recruitment rates and reasons for study refusals, feasibility to deliver the three components&#xD;
      of the intervention, data attrition and follow-up rates by treatment condition. Their&#xD;
      acceptability considers participant completion of the intervention rates, and a qualitative&#xD;
      assessment of the users' acceptability and satisfaction. Quantitative indicators of&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability will be presented on frequency and/or percentage. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes will include: changes in maternal postnatal symptoms of depression and anxiety,&#xD;
      change in parenting self-efficacy and perceived social support in both groups. Mixed-ANOVA&#xD;
      analysis will be used to examine this variables differences between EG and CG whilst&#xD;
      subjecting participants to repeated measures.&#xD;
