      Pragmatic clinical trial of an add-on therapy regarding the use of edupression.com® - a&#xD;
      licensed computer based self-help program - on patients with therapy-resistant depression&#xD;
      receiving esketamine nasal spray&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      edupression.com® - is a medical product and computer based self-help program based on&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy, psychoeducation and mood tracking. Patients included in the&#xD;
      interventional arm of this study are receiving full access to edupression.com®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to limited resources regarding face-to-face therapy and a high prevalence of Major&#xD;
      Depressive Disorder - of which 37% can be identified as therapy-resistant depression (TRD)&#xD;
      according to the definition of the European Medical Agency (EMA) - low-intensity psychosocial&#xD;
      interventions such as edupression.com® are recommended as first-line digital therapeutic&#xD;
      agent by international guidelines such as National Institute for Health and Care Excellence&#xD;
      (NICE) guidelines. Studies have shown that digital interventions - such as edupression.com -&#xD;
      show comparable clinical efficiency to face-to-face therapy and therefore could be able to&#xD;
      fill the gap in limited ressources. In this study patients with therapy-resistant depression&#xD;
      are receiving therapy with edupression.com® in addition to their treatment-as-usual with&#xD;
      esketamine nasal spray. Comparable studies have shown that patients receiving psychotherapy&#xD;
      in addition to their medical therapy benefit in regards to their clinical outcome.&#xD;
      Considering these findings, this study is aimed to investigate potential clinical benefits in&#xD;
      patients receiving digital therapy with edupression®.com as an add-on therapy to their&#xD;
      treatment-as-usual therapy with esketamine nasal spray.&#xD;

As such, detailed risk management documentation includes probability and severity of adverse events. Moreover, detailed strategies such as warnings were implemented in the software and documented accordingly.&#xD;
It can be used on a PC as well as on mobile devices (browser, app) at any time.</description>
