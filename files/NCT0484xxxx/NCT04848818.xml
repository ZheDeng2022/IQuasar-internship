      The study is designed as a multicenter trial for the treatment of distal pediatric forearm&#xD;
      fractures (=severely displaced distal metaphyseal forearm fractures) with a PLGA-based&#xD;
      biodegradable intramedullary implant in children. The primary objective of the trial is to&#xD;
      evaluate clinical outcome between Activa IM-Nail™ and K-wire in this indication. The&#xD;
      secondary objective is to evaluate potential differences of potential complications in the&#xD;
      operative method with either a biodegradable intramedullary PLGA-implant or with conventional&#xD;
      K-wires. K-wire osteosynthesis will be made according to the conventional surgical technique&#xD;
      by three paediatric trauma centers. Intramedullary PLGA implantation will be made by the&#xD;
      Péterfy Hospital. The surgical indication will be the same in all groups, and follow-up will&#xD;
      follow standard protocols. In the further clinical course, the patients in the study group&#xD;
      treated with PLGA implants spare a subsequent operation for implant removal after 4-8 weeks.&#xD;
      The results of different surgeries will be compared based on several criteria.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the last decade, there has been an increasing demand to overcome the disadvantages&#xD;
      associated with conventional implant materials, by developing new, alternative materials and&#xD;
      material production approaches for use in trauma care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years there has been a growing interest in the orthopaedic application of&#xD;
      resorbable implants. Their use in children may be particularly beneficial.&#xD;
      Poly(L-lactide)-co-glycolide acid (PLGA) is a well-known, reliable biodegradable material&#xD;
      that has been used in bone surgery for more than 20 years. Several publications have already&#xD;
      reported the successful use of intra-medullar PLGA implants in the treatment of paediatric&#xD;
      diaphyseal forearm fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To gather further evidence about the clinical value of the new method with PLGA - based&#xD;
      bioresorbable implant in regard to patients benefit, a multicenter prospective trial is&#xD;
      needed. This trial will be conducted on the distal forearm, which is one of the most common&#xD;
      fracture locations that requires surgical intervention in children. Severely displaced distal&#xD;
      paediatric forearm fractures will be addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Distal paediatric forearm injuries&#xD;
&#xD;
      Distal radius fractures are among the most common injuries of childhood. Optimal treatment&#xD;
      for distal radius fractures is still controversial. Treatment of severely displaced and&#xD;
      shortened fractures usually require general narcosis and closed reduction. Most authors&#xD;
      recommend osteosynthesis if the fracture remains unstable after reduction. The gold standard&#xD;
      operative method for these fractures is closed reduction, percutaneous pinning with&#xD;
      Kirschner-wires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kirschner-wire related minor complications are relatively frequent. Migration of the pins,&#xD;
      superficial infections, skin irritation are well manageable but significantly impair the&#xD;
      child's sense of comfort. Deep infections, tendon or nerve injuries may occur less often.&#xD;
      There is a controversy as to whether it is preferable to leave the wires outside the skin.&#xD;
      While wires left out of the skin increase the risk of infection, wires buried under the skin&#xD;
      can be removed with a second intervention. Removing the implants can also cause&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      K-wires are not capable of providing sufficient stabilization in this indication, so&#xD;
      additional casting treatment is also required. The duration and the type of postoperative&#xD;
      immobilization varies greatly according to the practice of the surgeons. There is no evidence&#xD;
      about the most optimal immobilization procedure. 4-6 weeks of cast wearing is recommended by&#xD;
      most authors. This causes stiffness in the affected joints and delays the recovery of full&#xD;
      function. Fractures with intramedullary elastic nails require a reduced time of&#xD;
      immobilization because they provide a more stable synthesis, but nails can be removed only&#xD;
      under general anaesthesia. The use of bioabsorbable intramedullary nails in distal paediatric&#xD;
      forearm fractures may eliminate all of the above-mentioned disadvantages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as a multicenter trial for the treatment of distal pediatric forearm&#xD;
      fractures (=severely displaced distal metaphyseal forearm fractures) with a PLGA-based&#xD;
      biodegradable intramedullary implant in children. The primary objective of the trial is to&#xD;
      evaluate clinical outcome between Activa IM-Nail™ and K-wire in this indication. The&#xD;
      secondary objective is to evaluate potential differences of potential complications in the&#xD;
      operative method with either a biodegradable intramedullary PLGA-implant or with conventional&#xD;
      K-wires. K-wire osteosynthesis will be made according to the conventional surgical technique&#xD;
      by two paediatric trauma centers. Intramedullary PLGA implantation will be made by the&#xD;
      Péterfy Hospital. The surgical indication will be the same in all groups, and follow-up will&#xD;
      follow standard protocols. In the further clinical course, the patients in the study group&#xD;
      treated with PLGA implants spare a subsequent operation for implant removal after 4-8 weeks.&#xD;
      The results of different surgeries will be compared based on several criteria.&#xD;
