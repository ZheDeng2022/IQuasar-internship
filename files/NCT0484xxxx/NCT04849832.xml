  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polyphenols present in tea are known to inhibit the absorption of non heme iron. The&#xD;
      inhibiting effect of tea on non-heme iron absorption is attributed to the flavonoids present&#xD;
      in tea. It is well known that Ferrous sulfate is not absorbed well in the presence of&#xD;
      polyphenols. We would like to evaluate the effect of polyphenols on the newly developed&#xD;
      compound, sodium iron chlorophyllin (SIC), which mimics the heme iron structure. Comparisons&#xD;
      of fractional absorption of SIC and Ferrous Sulfate in the presence of polyphenols can help&#xD;
      identify the performance of the compounds as vehicles for iron delivery in the presence of&#xD;
      iron absorption inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a single-blind randomized cross-over study using stable iron isotope technique, iron&#xD;
      bioavailability from SIC delivered with an inhibitory matrix can therefore be determined when&#xD;
      given along with black tea&#xD;

      New approaches to treat iron deficiency include developing novel iron compounds with possible&#xD;
      iron absorption routes that increase iron bioavailability and reduce gastrointestinal side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sodium iron chlorophyllin (SIC) is a water-soluble semisynthetic chlorophyll derivative where&#xD;
      the magnesium in the porphyrin ring has been substituted by iron. Given the porphyrin ring&#xD;
      heme-like structure of SIC, it may be an alternative delivery route for iron, suitable also&#xD;
      for vegetarians and vegans. Yet, there are few studies investigating the use of SIC for this&#xD;
      purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We recently completed the study entitled &quot;Evaluation of iron bioavailability from iron&#xD;
      chlorophyllin in young women using the iron stable isotopic method&quot; based on previous in&#xD;
      vitro and in vivo studies.. The study showed a 7% fractional iron absorption (FIA) from SIC&#xD;
      when compared to the control compound, ferrous sulfate, which had a FIA of 30%, indicating a&#xD;
      Relative Bioavailability of SIC of 20%. The study showed an inverse relationship between&#xD;
      ferritin status and iron absorption from SIC in the study participants and an increase in the&#xD;
      FIA in the presence of ascorbic acid. Both these findings lean towards the possibility that&#xD;
      that the iron contributing to the FIA from SIC may be iron that was dissociated from the&#xD;
      porphyrin ring of the chlorophyllin and entering the common non heme iron pool. This inverse&#xD;
      relationship in ferritin and FIA is well known for ferrous sulfate. However, one cannot&#xD;
      confirm the pathway taken up by SIC to deliver iron based on the previous study alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polyphenols present in tea are known to inhibit the absorption of non heme iron.The&#xD;
      inhibiting effect of tea on non-heme iron absorption is attributed to the flavonoids present&#xD;
      in tea. There are several types of tea flavonoids: monomers (catechin), dimers (theaflavin),&#xD;
      and polymers (thearubigin). Black tea contains 10% flavanols, 25% catechins, 20% theaflavins&#xD;
      and 45% thearubigins. The mechanism of iron absorption inhibition by tea is by formation of a&#xD;
      complex of the flavonoids with iron. It is mainly the galloyl group in these phenolic&#xD;
      compounds that specifically binds iron. A cup of black tea, brewed with 2.5 g tea leaves&#xD;
      contains about 200 mg tea flavonoids . Heme iron absorption has also been shown to be&#xD;
      inhibited by the presence of polyphenols but unclear to what extent. Thus, comparisons of&#xD;
      fractional absorption of SIC and Ferrous Sulfate in the presence of polyphenols can help&#xD;
      identify the performance of the compounds as vehicles for iron delivery in the presence of&#xD;
      iron absorption inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a single-blind randomized cross-over study using stable iron isotope technique, iron&#xD;
      bioavailability from SIC delivered with an inhibitory matrix can therefore be determined when&#xD;
      given along with black tea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIC has been produced at the HNL with a 50% incorporation of iron into the chlorophyll. Our&#xD;
      protocol is based on a Unilever patent that is no longer active, with in-house adaptation.&#xD;
      The SIC has a neutral taste and will be presented as a dark green liquid, being the solution&#xD;
      of SIC in water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If SIC, as hypothesized, behaves in a similar way to heme, then iron absorption inhibitors,&#xD;
      such as the polyphenols, will not have an effect on the absorption of iron from SIC.&#xD;
