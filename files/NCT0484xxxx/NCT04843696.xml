    <textblock>
      This investigator-initiated, prospective, single center, randomized, controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial enrolled patients with stable Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease&#xD;
      stage II-IV chronic obstruction pulmonary disease. The primary outcome was 2-year acute&#xD;
      exacerbation rates.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) has been suggested to be positive effects on 6 min walking&#xD;
      distance (6MWD), muscle force, cycle exercise endurance time, and quality of life. However,&#xD;
      the literature still could not explain the role of PR in reducing systemic inflammation of&#xD;
      chronic obstruction pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. A recent study found that PR with&#xD;
      negative pressure ventilation (NPV) improved lung function, exercise capacity and reduced&#xD;
      acute exacerbation rates in COPD patients. The objectives of this research are to design a&#xD;
      prospective, randomized controlled trial to determine the clinical outcome of NPV-PR in COPD&#xD;
      patients and to investigate if NPV-PR reduces systemic inflammation in patients with COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This investigator-initiated, prospective, single center, randomized, controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial enrolled patients with stable Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease&#xD;
      (GOLD) stage II-IV COPD. NPV was targeted to reduce baseline blood carbon dioxide by at least&#xD;
      20% during NPV titration. Patients were randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) to continue&#xD;
      optimised standard treatment (control group) or to receive additional NPV-PR for at least 24&#xD;
      months (intervention group). The primary outcome was 2-year acute exacerbation rates. The&#xD;
      lung function and walking distance will be assessed by six-minute walking tests and the&#xD;
      severity of disease will be evaluated by high resolution computed tomography scores.&#xD;
      Peripheral blood sample will be collected to analyze the inflammatory cytokines and oxidative&#xD;
      markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present prospective study, investigators hypothesize that NPV-PR would be superior to&#xD;
      usual care in reducing the risk for acute exacerbations of COPD, hospitalisations and&#xD;
      emergency visits over a 24-month period. This research will provide evidence for the role of&#xD;
      NPV-PR in the management of COPD, and evidence for a role of systemic inflammation in disease&#xD;
      progression of COPD. The results may provide certain insights into more effective treatments&#xD;
      to inhibit the disease progression of COPD.&#xD;

The patients received NPV with breathing training via a cuirass ventilator (cuirass diameter 21 cm or 34 cm, Dima Italia Srl.,Bologna, Italy) for 60 min, once per week.&#xD;
Breathing training consisted of breathing techniques (pursued-lipped, controlled, and diaphragmatic breathing).</description>
