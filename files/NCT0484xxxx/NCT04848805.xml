  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver transplantation has become an important treatment in hepatocellular cancer (HCC). While&#xD;
      the generally determined malign indication in the world is HCC, some centers perform liver&#xD;
      transplantation in both cholangiocarcinoma and mixed type hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma&#xD;
      diseases and investigate the differences in recurrence and survival outcomes compared to HCC.&#xD;
      Although liver transplantation for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas of small diameter &lt;2cm is&#xD;
      a popular topic of discussion around the world, a common consensus has not been established.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Combined hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinoma (CHC) with an incidence rate from 0.4% to&#xD;
      14.2% in different regions, characterized by hepatocellular and biliary epithelial&#xD;
      differentiation within the same tumor, is an unique type of primary hepatic carcinoma that is&#xD;
      distinct from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC).&#xD;
      Combined hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinoma is having attention clinically and&#xD;
      pathologically, because of its unique biology, histopathology, and clinical behavior, besides&#xD;
      the difficulties in diagnosis and being rare (comprising 1-5% of primary liver cancer). The&#xD;
      investigators aimed to present our experience with patients misdiagnosed before LT and found&#xD;
      to have incidentally ICC or CHC on explant and compare with HCC, and to identify the&#xD;
      demographic, clinical, pathological and etiological risk factors of recurrence and prognostic&#xD;
      factors of survival. Liver transplantation has been tried as an effective treatment in&#xD;
      mixed-type hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinomas and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, but&#xD;
      survival and recurrence-free outcomes have not been achieved as well as HCC. In addition,&#xD;
      survival rates reported in different centers also vary. Prognostic factors that may affect&#xD;
      disease recurrence and survival include etiology, body mass index, AFP, CEA, CA 19-9, CK7,&#xD;
      CK19, CD34, CD56, CD117, CD133, HSA, Arginase, HEPPAR, Amacyr, Glypican 3, Synaptophysin,&#xD;
      CK20, CDX2, p53, Ki67, milan criteria, tumor size, tumor number, maximum tumor diameter,&#xD;
      total tumor diameter, tumor grade, multicentricity, microvascular invasion, macrovascular&#xD;
      invasion, vascular invasion, tumor TNM stage. İnvestigating whether there is a difference&#xD;
      between mixed type hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinomas compared to HCC in terms of survival,&#xD;
      recurrence and other prognostic markers mentioned above would be important for mixed type&#xD;
      tumor relations with liver transplantation.&#xD;

        Collected LT database was retrospectively reviewed. 277 patients underwent LT for a primary&#xD;
        liver tumor between September 2004 and November 2019 were included in the study. Among&#xD;
        these, 17 patients (5%) with incidentally detected CHC and 5 patients (1.8%) with ICCA were&#xD;
        included in the study. 257 HCC patients were determined as the control group.&#xD;
