  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 24-week-long, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial exploring the&#xD;
      efficacy of a high-EPA multinutrient supplement in the management of high, non-clinical&#xD;
      anxiety and depression. The investigators focus on young and healthy, adult university&#xD;
      students, who may otherwise not be eligible for pharmacological or cognitive behavioural&#xD;
      therapy interventions.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      First-line treatment for anxiety disorders comprises Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, which is&#xD;
      ineffective in a considerable minority of individuals, and pharmacological treatments, which&#xD;
      often confer significant side effects. On the other hand, fish-oil-based supplements are&#xD;
      thought to be safer, efficacious alternatives, especially for individuals not eligible for&#xD;
      behavioural or pharmacological therapies. Evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs)&#xD;
      suggests that the long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCn-3 PUFAs)&#xD;
      eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) may exert beneficial anxiolytic&#xD;
      effects. It is also suggested that dietary components such as vitamins and minerals e.g.&#xD;
      a-tocopherol (vitamin E) and Magnesium (Mg), may also play a role in mood. It is furthermore&#xD;
      theorised that minor allelic carriage of desaturase and apolipoprotein E (APOE) polymorphisms&#xD;
      may also influence the putative anxiolytic potential of dietary components. However, despite&#xD;
      the abundance of findings in RCTs and animal studies, the putative synergism, additive&#xD;
      effects and precise mechanism of action of these macro- and micronutrients on anxiety in&#xD;
      humans are largely unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore this, the investigators have designed a randomised, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial. The investigators will randomise students from the University of&#xD;
      Roehampton aged 18-29 years (Emerging Adulthood), on a 1:1 allocation ratio, in two groups,&#xD;
      for 24 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Active treatment group to be supplemented with a high-EPA multinutrient supplement&#xD;
           providing a daily dose of 1,125 mg EPA, 441 mg DHA, 330 mg magnesium and 7.5 mg&#xD;
           Î±-tocopherol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Placebo group to be supplemented with an inert oil mix providing a daily dose of 3,060&#xD;
           mg sunflower seed oil, 60 mg lecithin, 300 mg glyceryl monostearate and 465 mg fish-oil&#xD;
           (18%/12% EPA/DHA respectively) for blinding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The choice of this population was made on the basis of its high-risk nature; university&#xD;
      students in Emerging Adulthood experience persistent levels of high-academic stress, social&#xD;
      disconnection and sleep disruption which increase anxiety levels and exacerbate psychological&#xD;
      distress and disengagement from study. University students are thus a high-risk, vulnerable&#xD;
      group characterised by higher and increasing rates of anxiety disorders compared to the&#xD;
      general population. Furthermore, this population is largely neglected by the therapeutic&#xD;
      literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Generally healthy, non-clinically anxious university students in Emerging Adulthood&#xD;
           experiencing high, non-clinical levels of anxiety, will benefit from supplementation&#xD;
           with a high-EPA multinutrient supplement, in that the latter will exert beneficial&#xD;
           anxiolytic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mg and vitamin E will exert additive anxiolytic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interindividual variations in fatty acid desaturases (FADS) and APOE genotypes will&#xD;
           influence the putative anxiolytic potential of the high-EPA multinutrient supplement&#xD;
           under investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will perform mixed-model analysis of covariance for the study primary and&#xD;
      secondary endpoints, on an intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) basis. This is a&#xD;
      single-centre investigation which will take place at the Department of Life Sciences of the&#xD;
      University of Roehampton, harmonised with local and national guidelines and risk assessments,&#xD;
      the code of Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. The study findings will&#xD;
      be reported in accordance with the CONSORT statement.&#xD;
