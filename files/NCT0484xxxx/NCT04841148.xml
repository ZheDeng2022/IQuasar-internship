  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will assess the safety and early efficacy of Hydroxychloroquine or&#xD;
      Avelumab, with or without Palbociclib, in early-stage ER+ breast cancer patients who are&#xD;
      found to harbor disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in the bone marrow after definitive surgery&#xD;
      and standard adjuvant therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this clinical trial is to reduce the incidence of incurable recurrent&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer by targeting the precursors of these recurrences, bone marrow&#xD;
      disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) present after definitive treatment. This trial targets unique&#xD;
      mechanisms by which DTCs maintain a dormant phenotype (autophagy) and by which they escape&#xD;
      dormancy (upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase4/6 (CDK4/6) pathway and&#xD;
      microenvironmental factors such as immune evasion). The selection of these agents is based&#xD;
      upon strong preclinical data demonstrating the relevance of autophagy (inhibited by HCQ), the&#xD;
      CDK4/6 pathway (inhibited by palbociclib) and the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)/Programmed&#xD;
      death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) immune checkpoint pathway (blocked by avelumab) as critical mechanisms&#xD;
      of cellular and immunological tumor dormancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase II trial is designed to provide &quot;proof of concept&quot; and estimates of effect of&#xD;
      various combinations and durations of these therapies on bone marrow DTCs as a surrogate for&#xD;
      ultimate reduction in recurrence. The correlative science aims will provide additional&#xD;
      insight into the relationship between the primary tumor and both the biology of DTCs and host&#xD;
      immune surveillance for target validation and development, as well as evaluate the role of&#xD;
      additional biomarkers both in the bone marrow (with a novel flow-based assay), and in the&#xD;
      peripheral circulation (including both circulating tumor cells and cell-free DNA), to&#xD;
      identify patients with minimal residual disease (MRD) and targets for intervention and&#xD;
      measurement of DTC response.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bone marrow aspirate after completion of all definitive therapy demonstrates&#xD;
             detectable DTCs (via IHC) as performed by central laboratory assessment at University&#xD;
             of Pennsylvania.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of stage II-III histologically-confirmed ER+/Her2 neg invasive breast cancer&#xD;
             with no evidence of recurrent local or distant disease (by American Joint Committee on&#xD;
             Cancer 7th edition). Patients with bilateral breast cancer are eligible, so long as&#xD;
             both cancers are ER+/Her2 neg, at least one meets other eligibility criteria and&#xD;
             patient is treated with curative intent. For patients who undergo neoadjuvant therapy,&#xD;
             eligibility is based upon pathologic stage of residual disease at surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ER+/Her2 neg receptor status on breast primary tumor (by American Society of Clinical&#xD;
             Oncology/College of American Pathologists guidelines). Any partial response (PR)&#xD;
             status is allowed. Tumors that are ER negative and PR positive are not eligible.&#xD;
             Patients who undergo neoadjuvant therapy are eligible if either the pre-treatment&#xD;
             biopsy or residual disease at surgery is ER+/Her2 neg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have completed all primary and adjuvant therapy (including surgery,&#xD;
             chemotherapy, and radiation) with the exception of adjuvant endocrine therapy. Prior&#xD;
             treatment-related toxicity must be resolved to ≤ Grade 1 with the exception of&#xD;
             alopecia and peripheral neuropathy, prior to study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have received prior CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy with an agent other than&#xD;
             Palbociclib. Patients must have discontinued CDK4/6 inhibitor at least 6 months prior&#xD;
             to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
             Patients are eligible to enroll within 2-7 years after initiation of adjuvant&#xD;
             endocrine therapy. Use of tamoxifen as adjuvant endocrine therapy during study&#xD;
             treatment is not allowed on hydroxychloroquine arms due to the potential drug-drug&#xD;
             interaction with hydroxychloroquine. However, patients on tamoxifen at the time of&#xD;
             screening may enroll on the treatment trial if switched to an aromatase inhibitor at&#xD;
             least 21 days prior to starting study therapy in the event patient is randomized to a&#xD;
             hydroxychloroquine containing arm. Premenopausal patients on concurrent ovarian&#xD;
             suppression are eligible. Patients on any other adjuvant endocrine therapy, including&#xD;
             any investigational therapy, are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving bone modifying agents (bisphosphonates or rank-ligand inhibitors)&#xD;
             at the time of screening may continue this therapy. Bone modifying agents may not be&#xD;
             initiated while receiving study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No concurrent enrollment on another investigational therapy clinical trial.&#xD;

             Patients with prior Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast are eligible if this&#xD;
             was diagnosed &gt; 5 years prior to enrollment. Patients with prior invasive malignancy&#xD;
             other than breast cancer are eligible if they have been disease-free for at least 5&#xD;
             years prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving chronic, high dose systemic treatment with corticosteroids defined&#xD;
             as: chronic use of cortisone &gt;50mg; hydrocortisone &gt;40mg, prednisone &gt;10mg,&#xD;
