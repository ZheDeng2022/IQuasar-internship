      We will perform a systemic review of previously published data and an updated patient-level&#xD;
      meta-analysis of studies, including the most recent publications. PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane&#xD;
      Central Register of Controlled Trials, the United States National Institutes of Health&#xD;
      registry of clinical trials, and relevant websites were searched for pertinent published&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;

      This is an individual patient-level data meta-analysis (IPD Meta-analysis). This study&#xD;
      population was incorporated from studies that were previoiusly published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will perform a systemic review of previously published data and an updated patient-level&#xD;
      meta-analysis of studies, including the most recent publications. PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane&#xD;
      Central Register of Controlled Trials, the United States National Institutes of Health&#xD;
      registry of clinical trials, and relevant websites were searched for pertinent published&#xD;
      studies. The electronic search strategy was complemented by manual examination of references&#xD;
      cited by included articles, recent reviews, editorials, and meta-analyses. No restrictions&#xD;
      were imposed on language, study period, or sample size. The search keywords include &quot;acute&#xD;
      coronary syndrome&quot;, &quot;ACS&quot;, &quot;primary&quot;, &quot;percutaneous coronary intervention&quot;, &quot;PCI&quot;,&#xD;
      &quot;de-escalation&quot;, &quot;guided&quot;, &quot;guide&quot;, &quot;antiplatelet&quot;, &quot;P2Y12 inhibitor&quot;, &quot;P2Y12&quot;, &quot;dual&#xD;
      antiplatelet therapy&quot;, &quot;DAPT&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Articles were included when they met the following prespecified criteria: (1) included the&#xD;
      ACS patients who underwent PCI with drug-eluting stent (DES); (2) maintained DAPT for 1 year;&#xD;
      (3) de-escalation strategy of DAPT was clearly defined; (4) clinical outcomes, including&#xD;
      ischemic and bleeding events, were clearly reported; (5) randomized controlled trials were&#xD;
      considered for inclusion. Two independent investigators screened titles and abstracts,&#xD;
      identified duplicated studies, performed full-article reviews, and determined the study&#xD;
      inclusion. The third investigator supervised the searching process and adjudicated all the&#xD;
      disagreements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After selecting eligible RCTs, we will incorporate all known randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      requesting individual patient data from the principal investigator of each trial.&#xD;
