  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, double-blind, placebo-controlled,dose-ranging clinical trial in healthy&#xD;
      males and non-pregnant females, 18 to 55 years of age, inclusive, who are SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      seronegative at screening. The trial is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity, and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of VACINA RNA MCTI CIMATEC HDT, which is a novel Lipid-Inorganic Nanoparticle&#xD;
      (LION) formulated replicating RNA-based vaccine that encodes for a full-length spike (S)&#xD;
      protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. As a replicating mRNA vaccine, VACINA RNA MCTI CIMATEC HDT&#xD;
      has the potential to allow the advantages of dose sparing, and possibly administration as a&#xD;
      single dose, compared with other mRNA platforms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment will occur at one domestic site. A total of 90 healthy subjects will receive&#xD;
      multiple dosages of intramuscular (IM) injections of VACINA RNA MCTI CIMATEC HDT. Subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized (4:1 ratio for active vaccine:placebo) with an equal probability of&#xD;
      receiving a two-dose schedule of the same concentration, 28 days (group 1) or 56 days (group&#xD;
      2 ) after the first dose, or, a single dose schedule (group 3). In order to address safety, a&#xD;
      sentinel group consisting of 1 individual will be initially registered and followed up until&#xD;
      day 8 (seven days after the first dose) for each of the cohorts. The first two cohorts will&#xD;
      receive two injections of VACINA RNA MCTI CIMATEC HDT at a dose of 1 µg or 5 µg respectively&#xD;
      on either Days 1 and 29 or on Days 1 and 57. The third cohort will receive a single dose of&#xD;
      25 µg. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of 3 dose&#xD;
      vaccination schedule of VACINA RNA MCTI CIMATEC HDT and 1 dose of placebo in healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and tolerability will be the primary endpoint assessed by incidence of adverse events&#xD;
      for each dose through 12 months after the vaccination. Scheduled interim immunogenicity&#xD;
      evaluations will be conducted for pre-specified timepoints as secundary and exploratory&#xD;
      endpoints.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this phase 1 dose-ranging study, 3 dosage cohorts (1 µg, 5 µg, 25 µg), 90 subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized (4:1 ratio for active vaccine:placebo) with equal probability of receiving a&#xD;
      two-dose schedule of the same concentration, 28 days (group 1) or 56 days (group 2 ) after&#xD;
      the first dose, or, a single dose schedule (group 3). For each of the three-dose groups, a&#xD;
      sentinel group of 1 subject will be initially enrolled and followed through Day 8 post-dose&#xD;
      one for safety. If no halting rules are met by Day 8 enrollment will proceed to the remaining&#xD;
      29 subjects. Following enrollment of the first cohort, the second dose cohort will be&#xD;
      enrolled in a similar fashion, with the sentinel group enrolled after a 7-day safety&#xD;
      observation period has elapsed following vaccination of the last subject in the first cohort.&#xD;
      Cohort 3 will be enrolled in a similar fashion following cohort 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a placebo group in each cohort in order to compare and improve the assessment of&#xD;
      causality of adverse events. At the screening visit, serum specimens will be obtained for&#xD;
      testing by IgG ELISA to identify persons seropositive to SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein, who&#xD;
      will be excluded from enrollment in order to perform this first assessment of safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity in a homogenous cohort of naïve subjects. Subjects that present IgG&#xD;
      anti-SARS-CoV-2 in serum samples will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double blinding was done to all cohorts. Subjects, clinical study staff, statisticians, and&#xD;
      investigators were masked to treatment assignment. Laboratory staff that manipulates the&#xD;
      vaccine and the placebo were not blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to internal contents were not differentiated, the injections were applied with&#xD;
      opaque syringes.&#xD;
