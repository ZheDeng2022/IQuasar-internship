      This study is being conducted to assess the performance of the Securis™ Stabilization Device&#xD;
      in simulated clinical use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to collect prospective observational data related to the safety and&#xD;
      performance of the Securis™ Stabilization Device in healthy volunteers utilizing a simulated&#xD;
      use method. Participants will have an intravenous catheter applied (not inserted) onto their&#xD;
      forearm with a Securis™ Stabilization Device applied over it. The site/device will be&#xD;
      assessed over a period of 9 days (ideally Days 0-7 in-clinic and Day 8 virtually). The&#xD;
      assessments will include the appearance of the site, the appearance of the dressing, and the&#xD;
      movement of the catheter tip under the dressing.&#xD;
