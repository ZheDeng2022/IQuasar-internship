      This study will recruit 30 subjects diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Subjects&#xD;
      will be recieve one infusion treatment of citalopram or placebo and 10 treatments of a form&#xD;
      of transcranial magnetic stimulation, theta burst stimulation (TBS). Subjects will also&#xD;
      undergo brain scans, quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) brain activity recordings,&#xD;
      and mood surveys. Study activities will be performed over the course of 4 weeks.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is an increasingly common treatment for&#xD;
      Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). rTMS applied to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the&#xD;
      most common treatment target, appears to change neuronal excitability in this region. rTMS&#xD;
      also changes function of brain circuits connected to DLPFC. This application proposes an&#xD;
      innovative approach to elucidating the mechanism of action (MOA) underlying these circuit&#xD;
      changes, using MDD as a significant translational model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One form of rTMS, theta burst stimulation (TBS), has particularly strong effects on cortical&#xD;
      excitability: intermittent pulsing over left DLPFC (iTBS) increases excitability, while&#xD;
      continuous pulsing over right DLPFC (cTBS) reduces excitability. TBS applied to DLPFC alters&#xD;
      functional connectivity with the anterior cingulate, medial frontal, and orbitofrontal&#xD;
      cortices (ACC, MFC, and OFC); however, the MOA underlying these changes in connectivity is&#xD;
      incompletely understood. Pilot data will be obtained for a larger grant application that will&#xD;
      test the hypothesis that changes in local excitability underlie the changes in functional&#xD;
      connectivity and the therapeutic efficacy of TBS for MDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TBS modulation of cortical excitability may be modulated in turn by the serotonergic (5HT)&#xD;
      neurotransmitter system, which is also a key target of classical antidepressant medications.&#xD;
      The investigators will use the 5HT transport inhibitor citalopram (CIT), a widely-used&#xD;
      clinical antidepressant agent, to investigate the serotonergic modulation of functional&#xD;
      connectivity and neurophysiologic measures of excitability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous citalopram hydrochloride has been available for prescription to patients with&#xD;
      treatment-refractory major depression and anxiety disorders in most of continental Europe for&#xD;
      more than 30 years. In the U.S., it has been used extensively as an investigational drug to&#xD;
      study human neurochemistry and in clinical trials for depressive disorders. An IND for the&#xD;
      University of Pittsburgh has utilized this compound safely as a research tool for more than&#xD;
      10 years (Smith et al., 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This double-blinded study will recruit 30 subjects diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder&#xD;
      (MDD). Subjects will be randomized to acute (single-dose) citalopram (CIT) 40 mg iv treatment&#xD;
      or placebo, counterbalanced and combined with one of two forms of unblinded Transcranial&#xD;
      Magnetic Stimulation, i.e., either intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation or continuous Theta&#xD;
      Burst Stimulation. Assessments for this study include brain scans, qEEG recordings, and&#xD;
      cognitive and mood scales. One citalopram/placebo infusion and 10 TBS treatments will be&#xD;
      administered over the course of approximately two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty subjects ages 21-55 with a DSM-V diagnosis of MDD will be enrolled in a two-week&#xD;
      treatment study. After a baseline diagnostic assessment, all subjects will undergo&#xD;
      pretreatment assessment of brain functional connectivity (qEEG and fMRI) and structural&#xD;
      connectivity (DTI). They then will be randomized 1:1 to treatment with an intravenous dose of&#xD;
      CIT or placebo (PBO), followed by 1:1 randomized assignment to two weeks (10 sessions) of&#xD;
      treatment with either iTBS to left or cTBS to right DLPFC (four treatment conditions). The&#xD;
      end of Week 2 will constitute the primary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-density qEEG will be recorded throughout the initial CIT-TBS treatment session using&#xD;
      TMS-compatible qEEG. These recordings will be used to assess changes in excitability with&#xD;
      CIT/PBO and iTBS/cTBS treatment (i.e., TMS evoked Local Mean Field Power, or LMFP). The&#xD;
      investigators will determine whether changes in cortical excitability in DLPFC are modulated&#xD;
      by 5HT neurotransmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, changes in neuroplasticity in limbic circuits involving DLPFC will be examined, from&#xD;
      pretreatment baseline to after the first treatment, and from baseline to the primary&#xD;
      endpoint, using functional connectivity measures. qEEG will be used to measure changes in&#xD;
      signal synchronization and information flow (i.e., lagged coherence, Granger Causality), as&#xD;
      well as location and spread of current sources (LORETA source localization). fMRI will be&#xD;
      used to examine resting state network function (BOLD signal). The investigators will test&#xD;
      whether changes in excitability measured in the first treatment are correlated with changes&#xD;
      in connectivity with the first treatment, as well as over the full course of treatment.&#xD;
      Correlation would suggest that excitability may exert a metaplastic effect on functional&#xD;
      connectivity in limbic circuits involving DLPFC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the investigators will examine symptom change at the primary endpoint, and determine&#xD;
      whether excitability and connectivity changes correlate with symptom improvement. Integrated&#xD;
      examination of changes in excitability, immediate and longer-term connectivity, and symptom&#xD;
      improvement, will elucidate the MOA of TBS and could lead to strategies to enhance treatment&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical diagnosis and assessment. Thirty subjects with a DSM-V diagnosis of MDD established&#xD;
      using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI, version 7.0)&#xD;
      (http://www.medical-outcomes.com/index/mini7fororganizations) will be enrolled, with all&#xD;
      subjects having depressive symptoms of at least moderate severity as indicated by a 17-item&#xD;
      Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [Ham-D17] score &gt; 17 (23 below) will be enrolled. Subjects&#xD;
      will undergo clinical assessment using methods similar to those employed in our previous&#xD;
      treatment studies using TMS (Leuchter et al., 2015). Subjects will have failed to enter&#xD;
      remission with at least two prior antidepressant medications (Sackeim et al., 1990; Vasavada&#xD;
      et al., 2016) and must have been free of any medications known to significantly affect brain&#xD;
      function for at least ten days prior to enrollment (except fluoxetine, which will require a&#xD;
      five-week washout) (Vasavada et al., 2016). Subjects will be excluded if they meet DSM-V&#xD;
      criteria for any other current primary Axis I mood, anxiety, or psychotic disorder,&#xD;
      depression secondary to a general medical condition, or substance-induced illness. Subjects&#xD;
      also will be excluded if they have current suicidal intent or plan, a history of substance&#xD;
      abuse or dependence within the past six months (except nicotine and caffeine), Bipolar&#xD;
      Disorder or psychotic disorder (lifetime), eating disorder (current or within the past year),&#xD;
      Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (lifetime), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD, current or&#xD;
      within the past year), medical or neurologic illness that would contraindicate administration&#xD;
      of study interventions or complicate interpretation of study results, or have an implanted&#xD;
      medical device or metal in their body that would contraindicate an MRI or TMS treatment&#xD;
      (Leuchter et al., 2015). Subjects also will be excluded if they have had prior history with&#xD;
      IV citalopram. Women who are currently pregnant, not using a medically acceptable means of&#xD;
      birth control, or are breastfeeding will be excluded. A urine drug screen will be performed,&#xD;
      and subjects with a positive screen for illicit substances will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mood symptoms will be examined after the first, second, and 10th treatment sessions using the&#xD;
      Clinician Global Impressions-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) and Improvement (CGI-I) (Cohen et&#xD;
      al., 2014), and the subject-rated Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (IDS-SR)&#xD;
      (Connolly et al., 2012), with symptoms of suicidal ideation assessed using the Columbia-&#xD;
      Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) (Cornwell et al., 2012). Assessments at time of entry&#xD;
      and exit from the study will include symptom ratings with the Ham-D17 and quality of life and&#xD;
      functional status ratings with the Quality of Life Inventory (QOLI) (Dandash et al., 2015).&#xD;
      Treatment response at the primary endpoint is defined as a 50% or greater improvement from&#xD;
      baseline on the Ham-D17 and remission as a final Ham-D17 score &lt; 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment procedures Citalopram (CIT) and placebo (PBO) infusion. CIT and saline PBO will be&#xD;
      administered intravenously using established clinical procedures. A single dose of citalopram&#xD;
      40 mg in 60 cc normal saline, or saline PBO, will be delivered intravenously under&#xD;
      double-blind conditions via pump over a 40-minute period. Blood will be drawn at the&#xD;
      conclusion of infusion to obtain a plasma sample for CIT levels. Subjects will be fasting&#xD;
      after midnight or for a minimum of 8 hours prior to undergoing infusion. Vital sign&#xD;
      monitoring will include blood pressure, pulse oximetry, and respiratory rate recording every&#xD;
      3 minutes and a continuous cardiac rhythm strip. A change of greater than 25% increase in&#xD;
      heart rate or blood pressure from baseline or absolute increase in heart rate above 120 bpm&#xD;
      or systolic blood pressure ≥ 180 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 105 mm Hg sustained from&#xD;
      more than 2 minutes will prompt the immediate discontinuation of double-blind infusion and&#xD;
      evaluation for intervention. Similarly, a drop of O2 saturation via pulse oximetry to less&#xD;
      than 92% will prompt evaluation of subject, initiate use of nasal cannula O2 at 2 liters/min&#xD;
      or rate necessary to return O2 saturation to baseline at room air or greater than 95%. A&#xD;
      physician investigator will administer the CIT or PBO infusion, perform subject assessment&#xD;
      and direct nursing staff. Mental status monitoring will also occur during double-blind&#xD;
      infusion to assess for any untoward behavioral or psychological effects. Subjects will be&#xD;
      instructed not to drive for up to 24 hours after infusion and will need to be driven to and&#xD;
      from UCLA for the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (TBS). Stimulation will be performed using a&#xD;
      Magstim Rapid2 biphasic stimulator with a figure-8 coil (14 cm width) and 2 T peak field&#xD;
      strength. Stimulation percentages are expressed as a proportion of this individual unit's&#xD;
      Maximum Stimulator Output (MSO). This unit can generate the theta-burst stimulation patterns&#xD;
      at intensities of 45% MSO or below, well within range of most participant's individual motor&#xD;
      threshold (MT). To determine MT, the coil will be held mediolaterally over the region of the&#xD;
      left motor cortex with the handle pointing backwards and 45° from sagittal midline. This&#xD;
      technique induces current roughly perpendicular to the central sulcus. The right first dorsal&#xD;
      interosseus muscle (FDI) will be monitored with surface electromyography (5000 Hz). TMS&#xD;
      pulses will be delivered in a grid at suprathreshold intensities in order to identify the&#xD;
      location which produces the largest, most consistent motor evoked potential (MEP) recorded&#xD;
      from the FDI. Intensities at this hotspot will then be lowered 1% with each stimulation. The&#xD;
      lowest intensity stimulation that produces peak-to-peak MEP amplitudes &gt;100 μV on at least 5&#xD;
      of 10 trials under conditions of gentle activation of the FDI is defined as the active motor&#xD;
      threshold (AMT). TBS intensity is then set at 120% AMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TBS consists of three TMS pulses given at 50 Hz, with this triplet repeated at a frequency of&#xD;
      5 Hz (every 200 ms) (Huang et al., 2005). 1800 pulses of cTBS will be delivered to the right&#xD;
      DLPFC, and an equal number to left DLPFC following the iTBS paradigm of a 2 s train of&#xD;
      repeated every 10 s. This number of pulses has been shown to have antidepressant efficacy&#xD;
      after two weeks of treatment (Li et al., 2014). Left and right DLPFC will be targeted using&#xD;
      the F3 and F4 EEG electrode locations, respectively. This method for magnet placement bears a&#xD;
      close relationship to placing the magnet over radiographically defined Broadmann areas (BAs)&#xD;
      in DLPFC (i.e., BA46) (Ahdab et al., 2010; Fitzgerald et al., 2009). This approach, widely&#xD;
      used in clinical practice, will allow us to easily relate the findings of this project to&#xD;
      clinical use. The investigators recognize that this probabilistic method for defining DLPFC&#xD;
      may result in some variability of magnet placement relative to underlying neuroanatomy. Given&#xD;
      interindividual variability in sulcal and gyral anatomy, however, it may not be possible to&#xD;
      reliably identify a specific BA in all subjects, and there is no &quot;gold-standard&quot; method for&#xD;
      standardizing neuroanatomic targeting across subjects. The investigators will have digitized&#xD;
      surface electrode locations from all subjects, and these locations will be fused with the&#xD;
      structural MRI images obtained from each subject at baseline and after the 10th iTBS&#xD;
      treatment. This will allow us to utilize neuroanatomic coil placement data as a post-hoc&#xD;
      covariate in data analyses (see MRI-EEG image integration below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurophysiologic recording and analyses. EEG recording. Data will be recorded using the &quot;eego&#xD;
      mylab&quot; TMS-compatible EEG system at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz (Advanced Neuro Technology&#xD;
      [ANT]; Enschede, Netherlands). Electrodes will be applied using the 64-electrode &quot;WaveGuard&quot;&#xD;
      system with sintered Ag/AgCl electrodes mounted in an elastic cap and positioned according to&#xD;
      the Extended 10-20 System. The material and shape of the electrodes prevents current loops is&#xD;
      designed for minimal DC shifts and optimal stability of the incoming signal during TMS. The&#xD;
      cap utilizes active shielding of each lead to limit electric noise. Data are recorded using&#xD;
      full-band EEG DC amplifiers that return to physiologic baseline signal level within 10 ms&#xD;
      after the end of the TMS pulse. Filters will not be applied during data acquisition, and&#xD;
      recording will be performed using a common average reference with impedance kept below 5 kΩ.&#xD;
      EOG will be recorded by placing two electrodes above and below the left eye. EEG will be&#xD;
      processed off-line in BrainVisionAnalyzer2 (BVA2) (BrainProducts GmbH; Gilching, Germany)&#xD;
      with a digital band-pass filter (Butterworth zero-phase shift, 0.5-70 Hz, 12 dB/oct; plus 60&#xD;
      Hz notch) before segmenting into 2 s epochs (100 ms pre-stimulus period), detrending, and&#xD;
      baseline correction. Data initially will be processed using semi-automated artifact rejection&#xD;
      methods previously described including ±100 μV peak-to-peak voltage step gradient or&#xD;
      persistent low activity (Leuchter et al., 2012), followed by visual inspection by two&#xD;
      independent technicians to eliminate data contaminated by muscle, head, or eye movement&#xD;
      artifacts. Adaptive Mixture ICA (AMICA) also will be used to separate out non-brain source&#xD;
      processes including eye blinks and saccades, scalp muscle, electrocardiographic artifact, and&#xD;
      line noise, increasing signal-to-noise (artifact) ratio and increasing reliability of high&#xD;
      frequency (beta and gamma) frequency analyses as well as brain source localization&#xD;
      (Bigdely-Shamlo et al., 2013; Delorme et al., 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Excitability measures. Excitability will be measured using the Local Mean Field Power (LMFP)&#xD;
      and Global Mean Field Power (GMFP) methods. Oscillatory voltage amplitude is the principal&#xD;
      measurement that directly reflects cortical excitability, and therefore changes in EEG field&#xD;
      power are used as the principal indicator of changes in excitability. LMFP can be used as a&#xD;
      measure of excitability at the site of TMS stimulation in any region of cortex; GMFP is a&#xD;
      measure of global excitability that has been used to study a number of non-invasive&#xD;
      neuromodulation treatments (Casarotto et al., 2013; Chung et al., 2015; Huber et al., 2008;&#xD;
      Pellicciari et al., 2013; Romero Lauro et al., 2014). After administration of a local&#xD;
      stimulus, a focal change in excitability may come to elicit a global change; as a result,&#xD;
      GMFP can be used to interpret LMFP and determine whether a local change in excitability&#xD;
      remains focal, or becomes part of a global change in excitability. For the excitability&#xD;
      determinations, single TMS pulses will delivered to left or right DLPFC (F3 or F4 electrode&#xD;
      location, coinciding with the treatment site) 10 minutes before and after treatment sessions.&#xD;
      Given the number of TBS pulses delivered in the protocol, changes in excitability can be&#xD;
      expected to remain stable for at least one hour following TBS treatment (Huang et al., 2005).&#xD;
      Pulses will be administered at a frequency of 0.25 Hz so that they are sufficiently&#xD;
      infrequent so as not affect excitability. During excitability determination, subjects will&#xD;
      wear earplugs and a masking noise will be played to reproduce the TMS &quot;click&quot; in time-varying&#xD;
      frequency components in order to suppress auditory evoked potentials. TEPs will be computed&#xD;
      by averaging valid artifact-free single trials, filtering between 2 and 40 Hz, and performing&#xD;
      baseline correction before and after the TMS pulse. LMFP will be calculated from the&#xD;
      amplitudes of the TEPs averaged from F3 or F4 and their respective four surrounding&#xD;
      electrodes, while GMFP will be calculated from all 64 electrodes. GMFP and LMFP will be&#xD;
      calculated in 30 ms time windows following the TMS pulse ranging from the end of the pulse to&#xD;
      400 ms (i.e., 0-30 ms, 30-60 ms, 60-90 ms, etc.) so that early and later changes in&#xD;
      excitability can be detected. Early time points (&lt; 90 ms) will be used to assess LMFP, and&#xD;
      later time points will be used to assess GMFP and spread altered excitability to other&#xD;
      cortical regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regional measures of neurophysiologic activity. Current source density (CSD) in gray matter&#xD;
      structures will be calculated using the eLORETA (exact Low Resolution Brain Electromagnetic&#xD;
      TomogrAphy) method (http://www.uzh.ch/keyinst/loreta.htm) (Lehmann et al., 2014). eLORETA&#xD;
      computes local neurophysiologic activity (Current Source Density, or CSD) as a linear&#xD;
      weighted sum of scalp electrical potentials. CSD measurements using eLORETA have been&#xD;
      validated as cortical sources of neurophysiologic activity, and obviate the the ambiguity of&#xD;
      source localization and the reference-dependence that are inherent in scalp EEG measurements&#xD;
      (Lehmann et al., 2014; Pascual-Marqui et al., 2011). The method identifies the smoothest&#xD;
      possible distribution of sources in a three-shell spherical head model, consisting of CSD at&#xD;
      each of 6239 cortical voxels (plus hippocampus and amygdala) (5 mm spatial resolution) in&#xD;
      Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space with electrode coordinates assigned according to&#xD;
      cross-registration between spherical and realistic head geometry (Towle et al., 1993).&#xD;
      Reported Brodmann areas utilize MNI space corrected to coincide with Talairach space (Brett&#xD;
      et al., 2002). Regions of interest (ROIs) will be created for subregions of the ACC, OFC,&#xD;
      hippocampus, insula, and other cortical ROIs in the limbic system based upon our prior work&#xD;
      and the broader literature (Arns et al., 2015; Korb et al., 2008; Korb et al., 2009; Korb et&#xD;
      al., 2011; Whitton et al., 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurophysiologic connectivity measures. The investigators will use one primary&#xD;
      neurophysiologic measure and several complementary techniques as secondary (exploratory)&#xD;
      measures in order to examine baseline and changes in neurophysiologic connectivity. Our&#xD;
      primary connectivity measure based upon CSD data will be examined using &quot;lagged&quot; coherence&#xD;
      (omitting zero phase angle) based on intracortical source modeling techniques (Lehmann et&#xD;
      al., 2014; Pasi et al., 1989). The investigators will identify cortical ROIs throughout the&#xD;
      PFC, hippocampus, and amygdala based upon BAs and subcortical probabilistic atlases, and will&#xD;
      apply the eLORETA option &quot;all nearest voxels&quot; to assigned voxels to the ROIs. The&#xD;
      investigators will use the ROIs identified by eLORETA as showing high activity to seed the&#xD;
      connectivity analyses; The investigators anticipate that the primary ROIs of interest will be&#xD;
      those with strong connections to DLPFC in the limbic system, including OFC, MFC, ACC,&#xD;
      hippocampus, and insula. Lagged coherence represents one of the two main components of&#xD;
      neurophysiologic connectivity: instantaneous and lagged. The lagged component is mediated by&#xD;
      physiological time delays, with the instantaneous contribution to the connectivity is&#xD;
      eliminated. This method selectively retains connectivity due to physiologic processes (for&#xD;
      any non-zero, measurable time delay) that is not confounded by low resolution and volume&#xD;
      conduction effects (Lehmann et al., 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary measures also will examine connectivity and cross-frequency coupling in the&#xD;
      electrode space using the Source Information Flow Toolbox (SIFT) (Delorme et al., 2011). This&#xD;
      method uses time-varying (adaptive) multivariate autoregressive modeling to detect and&#xD;
      measure fluctuations in effective connectivity between sources of neural activity. this&#xD;
      method is complementary to the lagged coherence method in using advanced multivariate&#xD;
      measures of directed information flow (e.g., Granger Causality Modeling and Directed Transfer&#xD;
      Function modeling). SIFT functions will be used to examine changes in effective connectivity&#xD;
      among the different experimental conditions and between treatment groups, using&#xD;
      bootstrap/resampling techniques to correct for multiple comparisons. 'Network Projection',&#xD;
      which is an extension of Measure Projection (Bigdely-Shamlo et al., 2013) will be performed&#xD;
      using pairwise connectivity to measure input, which is computed by blurring the dipole&#xD;
      locations and loading them with connectivity measures. The brain space will then be segmented&#xD;
      into 88 pre-defined anatomical ROIs provided by automated anatomical labeling (AAL) obtained&#xD;
      from WFU Pick Atlas (which is a SPM plugin). At this point, all the subjects have 88x88&#xD;
      matrix of connectivity values, therefore every subject has 7744 (88x88=7744) possible&#xD;
      combinations of directed causal flows. Diagnostic condition differences will be computed and&#xD;
      bootstrap statistics will be performed for each condition to control for type 1 error.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI scanning and analyses. Structural and functional MRIs including DTI will be acquired&#xD;
      using a head-only Siemens Prisma-FIT 3 Tesla scanner at the UCLA Ahmanson-Lovelace Brain&#xD;
      Mapping Center. This scanner is the latest Siemens 3T product modeled after the custom made&#xD;
      Skyra system originally developed for the Human Connectome Project (HCP). The investigators&#xD;
      will utilize the optimized HCP protocols (http://www.humanconnectome.org/) to ensure that the&#xD;
      connectivity data are collected and processed with state-of-the-art methods that will be&#xD;
      interpretable in the context of other ongoing NIH research. Total scanning time will about&#xD;
      one hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Structural MRI (sMRI). A whole brain structural scan will be obtained for registration with&#xD;
      EEG data and evaluating morphology (MPRAGE, TR=2300 ms, TE=3 ms, FOV=256 mm, 208 slices, .8 x&#xD;
      .8 x .8 mm voxels). The standardized HCP sMRI protocols include both 3D T1- and T2-weighted&#xD;
      (T1w and T2w) high resolution scans. Analyzed together, these sequences improve the automated&#xD;
      extraction of brain features, though both T1 and T2 scans may also be examined separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diffusion tensor MRI (DTI). The acquisition of DTI data will be used to measure the&#xD;
      structural connectivity of white matter. DTI will be acquired with two diffusion-weighted&#xD;
      gradients of b=0 and 1000 s/mm2 in 98 orthogonal directions (TE = 89.2 ms, TR = 3222 ms,&#xD;
      FOV=210mm, 92 slices, 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.5 mm voxels). The HCP also uses HARDI (High Angular&#xD;
      Resolution Diffusion Imaging) that provides greater precision for mapping the direction of&#xD;
      fibers in regions where fibers are crossing and allows for probabilistic tractography to&#xD;
      estimate fiber trajectories from ROIs defined with other imaging modalities (sMRI, fMRI, or&#xD;
      EEG). These same acquisition protocols will be used for this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resting-state fMRI (fMRI). fMRI will be used to characterize resting state network function&#xD;
      in a manner complementary to EEG. The investigators will use an echo-planar sequence (72&#xD;
      axial slices per volume, 104×90 matrix [2.0×2.0×2.0mm3], FOV=208mm, TE = 33.1ms, TR = 720ms,&#xD;
      FA = 52°, 420 volumes) to gauge resting-state BOLD signals. The HCP fMRI multiband EPI&#xD;
      sequence offers excellent spatial and temporal resolution and contain anterior-posterior and&#xD;
      posterior-anterior phase encoding to correct for anatomic distortions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI image processing. The investigators already have installed the HCP pipeline developed by&#xD;
      the Washington University group and have processed HCP-compliant data collected at UCLA using&#xD;
      this pipeline, achieving high quality tissue segmentation on the T1w MRI, white matter&#xD;
      tractography using HARDI, and resting brain networks based on fMRI. Each pipeline is&#xD;
      described separately below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Structural MRI. Three HCP pipelines are applied to sMRI (T1w &amp; T2w) data. The PreFreeSurfer&#xD;
      pipeline registers T1w and T2w images, performs bias-field correction, and normalizes these&#xD;
      images to MNI space. The FreeSurfer pipeline recreates FreeSurfer's reconall pipeline, which&#xD;
      segments tissue, reconstructs cortical surfaces, and aligns images to standard volume and&#xD;
      surface atlases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DTI. The Diffusion Preprocessing pipeline performs standard preprocessing steps using FSL,&#xD;
      including equalizing intensity of b0s across runs, removing EPI and eddy-current distortions,&#xD;
      correcting for motion and gradient nonlinearities, and registration to T1w images. The&#xD;
      investigators perform postprocessing using BrainSuite and its BrainSuite Diffusion Pipeline&#xD;
      (BDP) (http://brainsuite.org), which enables us to compute deterministic tractography using&#xD;
      the ODF data to generate whole-brain diffusion tracts. The investigators will then compute&#xD;
      the average fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), and&#xD;
      number of tracts along the white matter pathways connecting the anatomical ROIs (specific&#xD;
      circuits associated with depression, including tracts originating from the subgenual ACC and&#xD;
      DLPFC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resting state fMRI. Preprocessing protocols for functional data include two pipelines. The&#xD;
      first, fMRIVolume, corrects images for spatial distortions and motion, registers to T1w&#xD;
      images, corrects for subject motion, among other standard steps. The fMRISurface pipeline&#xD;
      aligns the output of fMRIVolume to cortical surfaces, including mapping onto a &quot;grayordinate&quot;&#xD;
      system to facilitate comparison and analyses across subjects. The investigators perform&#xD;
      resting state fMRI postprocessing using a novel method that is sensitive to spatial&#xD;
      differences between subjects. For graph theoretic analysis of brain networks, The&#xD;
      investigators will use independent components computed by ICA as well as structural ROIs&#xD;
      based on the Destrieux atlas as nodes, and the connectional relationships between each pair&#xD;
      of components will be evaluated by partial correlation analysis. The brain networks will be&#xD;
      characterized by network parameters computed from their adjacency matrixes to quantitatively&#xD;
      describe topology of networks, including 1) node degree, degree distribution and&#xD;
      assortativity; 2) clustering coefficient and motifs; 3) path length and efficiency; 4)&#xD;
      connection density or cost; 5) hubs, centrality and robustness; and 5) modularity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI-EEG image integration. In order to identify the location of the F3 electrode scalp site&#xD;
      at which TBS is being delivered into the MRI space, as well as fully integrate the EEG and&#xD;
      MRI datasets, The investigators will employ the Advanced Neuro Technology Xensor 3D electrode&#xD;
      digitizer system (ANT Neuro; Enschede, Netherlands). This system uses a digitizing wand with&#xD;
      reflective markers and an infrared camera to identify the 3D locations of all 64 EEG&#xD;
      electrodes and three major fiducials (nasion, left and right preauricular points) for each&#xD;
      participant in less than 10 minutes. The 3D digitized locations then are coregistered to the&#xD;
      Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI-Colin27) template brain (Montreal Neurological&#xD;
      Institute, Montreal, Canada. URL www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/brainweb). Electrode locations can be&#xD;
      used in the Visor 2.0 neuronavigation system (ANT Neuro; Enschede, Netherlands) to visualize&#xD;
      the stimulation target and associated scalp site that was actually used during TBS in each&#xD;
      individual. After loading each subject's raw MRI images into the Visor software, the&#xD;
      relationship of the F3 stimulation site to the DLPFC target, as well as any individual&#xD;
      electrode to underlying neuroanatomy, can be identified using the MNI coordinates.&#xD;

    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>The 30-item Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (IDS-SR) is designed to assess the severity of depressive symptoms. The IDS-SR assess all the criterion symptom domains designated by the American Psychiatry Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - 4th edition (DSM-IV) (APA 1994) and the 5th edition add reference to diagnose a major depressive episode. These assessments can be also used to screen for depression, although they have been used predominantly as measures of symptom severity. The seven-day period prior to assessment is the usual time frame for assessing symptom severity.&#xD;
Each item has four statements that reflect various degrees of symptom severity, scored on a four-point scale from 0 to 3. Score range is 0-84 points. Higher score reflects increased severity in depressive symptoms.</description>

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No unstable medical illness that would prevent completion of participation in the&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any indication of suicidal ideation (e.g. as assessed by the suicidality question on&#xD;
             the HamD17or the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Baseline QT prolongation (QTc&gt; 450 ms): Given that citalopram has been found to be&#xD;
             associated with a dose-dependent risk of ECG QT interval prolongation, in order to&#xD;
             avoid the potential risk of causing ventricular arrhythmias including Torsades de&#xD;
             Pointes, we will exclude participants from the study who exhibit baseline QTc&#xD;
             prolongation.&#xD;
&#xD;

             depression secondary to a general medical condition, or substance- induced illness.&#xD;
             Subjects also will be excluded if they have current suicidal intent or plan, a history&#xD;
             of substance abuse or dependence within the past six months (except nicotine and&#xD;
             caffeine), Bipolar Disorder or psychotic disorder (lifetime), eating disorder (current&#xD;
             or within the past year), Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (lifetime), Post-Traumatic&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Axis III: active medical illness known to significantly affect brain function or that&#xD;
             could be etiologically related to the ongoing depression (e.g., untreated&#xD;
             hypothyroidism);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current treatment with a medication known to affect brain function. This would include&#xD;
             both psychiatric and centrally-acting neurological agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The investigators have chosen to exclude these subjects because current medication could&#xD;
        affect measures of brain function as well as introduce an uncontrolled treatment effect&#xD;
        into the study. Prospective subjects who are currently taking psychiatric medications will&#xD;
        also be excluded as the risk of antidepressant discontinuation outweighs the potential&#xD;
        benefit of study participation. A history of prior treatment with IV CIT. We have chosen to&#xD;
        exclude subjects who have received this treatment because they may have a degree of&#xD;
        treatment resistance that would make it less likely for them to respond to treatment in the&#xD;
        current protocol. Additionally, if they previously have received CIT the PBO treatment&#xD;
        blind in the current protocol may not be effective;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current treatment with a medication known to affect brain function. We have chosen to&#xD;
             exclude these subjects because current medication could affect measures of brain&#xD;
             function as well as introduce an uncontrolled treatment effect into the study. These&#xD;
             medications include: antidepressants, barbiturates, anticonvulsants/mood stabilizers,&#xD;
             benzodiazepines, anticholinergics, herbal preparations, antipsychotics, muscle&#xD;
