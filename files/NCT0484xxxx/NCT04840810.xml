  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The insertion of central venous catheters (CVCs) has become an integral part of management of&#xD;
      a critically ill patient. Access to the central vein may be required for the administration&#xD;
      of hyper osmotic or vasoactive compounds, parenteral nutrition, and rapid infusion of large&#xD;
      volumes of fluid or for the continuous or intermittent monitoring of biochemical or&#xD;
      physiological parameters. Central venous catheter insertion is also indicated when the&#xD;
      insertion of a peripheral line is not possible. Traditionally, CVC insertions have been&#xD;
      performed using the landmark technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the number of CVCs being inserted every day, this can amount to a large number of&#xD;
      complications. Efforts to minimize and prevent the occurrence of complications should be a&#xD;
      routine component of quality improvement programs. There is an increasing body of evidence&#xD;
      supporting the use of ultrasound guidance for CVC placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This makes the strong rationale to conduct this research thus the aim of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the real benefits i.e outcome of Long versus Short Axis ultrasound guided approach&#xD;
      for internal jugular vein cannulation in the patient for elective cardiac surgery as central&#xD;
      venous cannulation (CVC).&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE: To compare the in plane and out of plane ultrasound guided approach for internal&#xD;
      jugular vein cannulation in the patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound-guided central vein cannulation has many advantages, giving the operator the&#xD;
      possibility of choosing the most appropriate and safest venous access on the basis of&#xD;
      ultrasound assessment, performing a 100% safe insertion, ruling out malposition or&#xD;
      pleuropulmonary damages, during and after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an increasing body of evidence supporting the use of ultrasound guidance for CVC&#xD;
      placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This makes the strong rationale to conduct this research thus the aim of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the real benefits i.e outcome of Long versus Short Axis ultrasound guided approach&#xD;
      for internal jugular vein cannulation in the patient for elective cardiac surgery as central&#xD;
      venous cannulation (CVC).&#xD;

    <description>In a short-axis view, the image plane is perpendicular to the course of the vessel and to the needle (needle is &quot;out of plane&quot;). The vessel appears as an anechoic circle on the screen of ultrasound with the needle visualized as a hyperechoic point in cross-section. The central venous cannulation was done in out of plane axis.</description>

    <description>In a long-axis view, the image plane is parallel to the course of the vessel (needle is &quot;in-plane&quot;).
