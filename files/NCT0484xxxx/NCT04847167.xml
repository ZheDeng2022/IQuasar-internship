    <textblock>
      Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the current standard technique for&#xD;
      the treatment of pancreatobiliary disease. However, ERCP in patients with a surgically&#xD;
      altered anatomy (SAA) remains a challenge. The short-type balloon enteroscope dedicated to&#xD;
      pancreatobiliary intervention was recently introduced and has gained popularity as a primary&#xD;
      modality for ERCP in patients with SAA. The currently available short-type single-balloon&#xD;
      enteroscope (SBE) has a 3.2-mm enlarged diameter for the working channel and a 152-cm&#xD;
      shortened working length, which can accommodate most conventional ERCP accessories and stent&#xD;
      assemblies, and it is equipped with high-force transmission and passive bending, which&#xD;
      facilitate passing the sharply angulated bowel segment. However, Roux-en-Y (R-Y)&#xD;
      reconstruction anatomy is still challenging for the pancreatobiliary physician with regard to&#xD;
      ERCP owing to the long length of the Roux and pancreatobiliary limb, and bowel angulations&#xD;
      around the jejunojejunal anastomosis. The pooled procedural success of short SBE-assisted&#xD;
      ERCP (SBE-ERCP) for R-Y reconstruction was reported to be 76.4% in a recent metaanalysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most important factor for procedural success and safety of short SBE-ERCP for R-Y&#xD;
      patients is to resolve and prevent various bowel types looping through the collaborative&#xD;
      manipulation of an enteroscope and overtube. In the clinical field, there is an unmet need&#xD;
      for a formulaic loop-handing technique that can be applied to most cases of R-Y&#xD;
      reconstruction. Therefore, in the current study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of a mechanistic loop resolution strategy for short SBE-ERCP in patients undergoing R-Y&#xD;
      reconstruction.&#xD;

      SBE-ERCP and mechanistic loop resolution strategy The mechanistic loop resolution strategy&#xD;
      was first introduced by an experienced senior professor with 30 years of experience with&#xD;
      conventional balloon enteroscopy and ERCP. Based on this strategy, SBE-ERCP in this study was&#xD;
      performed by a junior professor with 8 years of experience in colonoscopy and ERCP and had&#xD;
      performed 5 cases of conventional BE-ERCP as an assistant before 2019. The short SBE was&#xD;
      introduced in Korea in 2019, and from this time, the junior professor underwent training in&#xD;
      SBE-ERCP with the mechanistic loop resolution strategy via 10 cases with Billroth-II or R-Y&#xD;
      anatomy. From January 2020, he began performing SBE-ERCP as the main operator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All ERCP procedures were performed with the patient in the prone position using an SBE&#xD;
      (SIF-H290S; Olympus Corp., Japan) under CO2 insufflation and conscious sedation. A soft&#xD;
      transparent hood (D-201-11804; Olympus Corp.) was used in all cases. The SBE was introduced&#xD;
      alternately with an overtube apparatus (ST-SB1S; Olympus Corp.) following the mechanistic&#xD;
      loop resolution strategy under endoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance. The overtube was&#xD;
      advanced along the enteroscope by gently pulling the enteroscope, similar to the ERCP&#xD;
      accessory advancement over the guidewire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanistic loop resolution strategy for total gastrectomy with R-Y reconstruction First&#xD;
      (Step 1), an enteroscope was inserted beyond the esophagojejunal anastomosis into the&#xD;
      jejunum, and the overtube was advanced across the esophagojejunal anastomosis to prevent&#xD;
      recurrent reverse C-loop formation at the esophagojejunal junction. Second (Step 2), whenever&#xD;
      an enteroscope was passed through the U-shaped or inverse U-shaped jejunal segment, an&#xD;
      overtube was advanced along the enteroscope to sufficiently cover the U-shaped or inverse&#xD;
      U-shaped jejunal segment. Thereafter, the enteroscope-overtube apparatus was retracted&#xD;
      simultaneously after overtube ballooning to pleat the jejunum and to prevent U-loop or&#xD;
      inverse U-loop reformation following subsequent enteroscope insertion. Subsequently (Step 3),&#xD;
      when the U-shaped, inverse U loop became part of a three-dimensionally rotated N-loop, the&#xD;
      enteroscope occasionally could not pass the U-shaped or inverse U-shaped jejunal segment,&#xD;
      making a cane shape. At that time, the control section of the enteroscope was rotated 360Â°&#xD;
      from its place, clockwise or counterclockwise toward the direction in which the loop&#xD;
      formation was prevented. This preemptive extreme rotation maneuver aimed to minimize&#xD;
      rotational vector forces from the loop and stiffen the enteroscope. Further (Step 4), when a&#xD;
      three-dimensionally rotated loop containing a ring structure such as alpha, reverse alpha,&#xD;
      and gamma loop was formed during enteroscope advance, before the trial of loop resolution,&#xD;
      the tip of the overtube was positioned so that it did not reach the ring structure of the&#xD;
      loop, with the ring structure not being covered with the overtube. Thereafter, the loop was&#xD;
      corrected by rotating the enteroscope-overtube apparatus. This maneuver allowed the&#xD;
      enteroscope to rotate in a three-dimensional spiral direction, whereas the overtube rotated&#xD;
      in place, leading to the effective transmission of the rotational force generated by the&#xD;
      operator's hand to the enteroscope-overtube apparatus. Biliopancreatic cannulation and&#xD;
      therapeutic maneuvers were attempted by intentionally retroflexing the enteroscope tip near&#xD;
      the inferior duodenal flexure. In Step 5, if the enteroscope tip was repetitively withdrawn&#xD;
      before complete loop resolution due to a weak anchoring effect of the enteroscope tip, the&#xD;
      overtube was further advanced into the ring structure of the loop to support the additional&#xD;
      advancement of the enteroscope until a more suitable point for hooking and anchoring the&#xD;
      enteroscope tip. When the enteroscope tip reached this anchoring point, the overtube was&#xD;
      retracted back to the starting point of the ring structure of the loop, while maintaining the&#xD;
      enteroscope tip in place. Thereafter, loop resolution was reattempted as described in Step 4.&#xD;
      In Step 6, after passing the SBE into the pancreatobiliary jejunal limb and duodenum, a large&#xD;
      reverse alpha loop that was formed through the Roux limb, jejunojejunal anastomosis, and&#xD;
      pancreatobiliary limb was usually allowed without a trial of reduction because it facilitated&#xD;
      the retroflex positioning of the enteroscope tip around the inferior duodenal flexure and&#xD;
      guaranteed an enface view of the major papilla.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanistic loop resolution strategy for R-Y hepaticojejunostomy with preserved stomach First&#xD;
      (Step 1), once the enteroscope reached the second or third portion of the duodenum in a&#xD;
      long-scope position, the enteroscope was straightened with rightward rotation and retraction,&#xD;
      making a short-scope position, similar to the ERCP position. An overtube was passed into the&#xD;
      duodenum over the straightened enteroscope, maintaining the short-scope position. The&#xD;
      overtube balloon was positioned in the superior duodenal angle or duodenal bulb across the&#xD;
      pyloric ring and inflated to prevent the overtube from being withdrawn back into the stomach.&#xD;
      Thereafter (Step 2), the enteroscope was further advanced into the distal duodenum and&#xD;
      jejunum, maintaining the short-scope position and being cautious of the recurrence of the&#xD;
      long-scope position of the enteroscope in the stomach. In this step, continuous covering of&#xD;
      the superior duodenal angle and pyloric ring with the overtube balloon was crucial for&#xD;
      maintaining the short-scope position. In Step 3, after the tip of the enteroscope was&#xD;
      inserted deep into the jejunum, the unstable loops over the superior and inferior duodenal&#xD;
      flexure were corrected, making the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, and proximal jejunum lie in&#xD;
      a straight line. The other basic loop resolution strategies were the same as those described&#xD;
      for total gastrectomy with R-Y reconstruction.&#xD;
