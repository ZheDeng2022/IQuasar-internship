  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) we want to study how supplements of cetoleic acid (&#xD;
      C22:n1-11) (intervention) affect the conversion of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) to EPA&#xD;
      (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) in healthy subjects, compared to&#xD;
      supplements with a low concentration of cetoleic acid (control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary endpoints are changes in the concentration of EPA and DHA in plasma and red blood&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized double-blinded controlled trial ( randomized 1:1). Study population:&#xD;
      healthy men and women 20-70 years, BMI 20-35 kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 weeks run-in-period where all participants consume control capsules every morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomization intervention: control (1:1). All participants consume their capsules&#xD;
           (control or intervention) for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention oil consists of a fish oil high in cetoleic acid and the control oil is a&#xD;
      mix of different oils and low in cetoleic acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation and sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was expected a difference of 15% in n-3 between the groups after the intervention (Ã˜stbye&#xD;
      et al. 2019, doi:10.1017/S0007114519001478).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The level of significance was set to 5% (two-sided) and the power to 80%. A total of&#xD;
      thirty-eight subjects were required to participate in the study, but a high dropout rate was&#xD;
      expected (20%) and it was considered necessary to include a total of seventy (n=70) subjects&#xD;
      (thirty-five per arm).&#xD;
