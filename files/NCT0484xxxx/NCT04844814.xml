  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gout is secondary to urate crystal deposition after chronic elevation of serum urate level.&#xD;
      Urate crystal deposition is responsible for acute and recurrent inflammatory flares which can&#xD;
      be treated with colchicine, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), corticosteroid or&#xD;
      interleukin (IL)-1b blockade. Colchicine and NSAID are contra-indicated in patients with&#xD;
      chronic renal disease (CKD) stage 4/5 or with renal transplantation. In these patients gout&#xD;
      flare is treated with high dose of corticosteroid or IL-1b inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frequent use of high dose of corticosteroid can worsen gout comorbidities including mellitus&#xD;
      diabetes type 2, hypertension, obesity and dyslipidemia. Anakinra, an IL-1b receptor&#xD;
      antagonist, is efficient in gout flare in patients without CKD stage 4/5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to demonstrate that anakinra is superior to prednisone to treat gout&#xD;
      flare in patients with CKD 4/5 or renal transplantation.&#xD;

      The study will include 234 gouty patients with CKD 4/5 or renal transplantation with gout&#xD;
      flare&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include the following visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Selection/inclusion visit (V0):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient with gout flare and CKD 4/5 or renal transplantation will be included and randomized&#xD;
      to receive either anakinra 100 mg/d or prednisone 30 mg/d.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Visit from day (d)0 to d5: included patients will be hospitalized and treatment will be&#xD;
      administrated by a nurse. Treatment will be stopped if patient had ≥ 80% improvement.&#xD;
      Treatment response is defined by improvement ≥ 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be evaluated every day from d0 to d5. At d3, if improvement is &lt; 50%, patient&#xD;
      will be considered as non-responder and patient will be managed as physician's habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At d5, if improvement is &lt; 80%, patient will be managed as physician's habits Between d1 and&#xD;
      d5, if improvement ≥ 80%, patient can be discharged and will have a visit at d5 as&#xD;
      outpatient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Visit month (M)1 end of research: clinical evaluation of gout, demographic characteristics,&#xD;
      medication, number of gout flare within the month, number of hospitalization and/or medical&#xD;
      consultation within the month, blood analysis (serum creatinine level, eGFR, SUL, CRP, HbA1C,&#xD;
      total, HDL and LDL cholesterol, triglyceride, glycaemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study ends after the M1 consultation. The total duration of participation in the study is&#xD;
      1 month.&#xD;
