  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The participants are being asked to take part in this research study because the participant&#xD;
      is a child who has been diagnosed with cancer and has completed genetic testing to find out&#xD;
      if the participant has a variant in a gene that may predispose the participant to cancer,&#xD;
      and/or the participants are the parents (i.e., guardian/caregiver) of this child. This&#xD;
      research is being done to understand how finding out the results of genetic testing during&#xD;
      childhood impacts the participant and family. The investigator will compare the emotions and&#xD;
      behavior of parents and children based on the genetic testing results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine the impact of genetic testing result disclosure for a pathogenic (P)/likely&#xD;
           pathogenic (LP) germline variant in a known cancer predisposing gene versus negative&#xD;
           results on parent adjustment (i.e., emotional functioning, cancer worry, symptom&#xD;
           interpretation, and genetic testing related worry/distress).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine the impact of genetic testing result disclosure for a P/LP germline variant&#xD;
           versus negative results on parenting (i.e., responses to children's symptoms,&#xD;
           overprotectiveness, parent-child communication, cohesion, and expressivity in the&#xD;
           family).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine the impact of genetic testing result disclosure (P/LP versus negative results)&#xD;
           on child adjustment (i.e. emotional functioning, cancer worry, self-perception, and life&#xD;
           meaning and purpose).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine the impact of disclosing a variant of uncertain significance (VUS) on parent&#xD;
           adjustment, parenting, and child adjustment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine the indirect association between genetic testing result disclosure (P/LP versus&#xD;
           negative results) and child adjustment through parental adjustment and parenting&#xD;
           behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Qualitatively identify children and parents' perspectives of how disclosure of a cancer&#xD;
           predisposition has affected children's emotional, social, personal, and familial&#xD;
           functioning.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A mixed methods approach, including questionnaires and qualitative interviews with children&#xD;
      and their parents. Participants (&quot;Primary Strata:&quot; parents (i.e., guardians/caregivers) and&#xD;
      children age ≥ 8 years, n=132; &quot;Parent Only Strata:&quot; parents of children age &lt; 8 years, n=66)&#xD;
      will complete questionnaires to examine the impact of germline variant disclosure on parent&#xD;
      adjustment, parenting, and child adjustment. Optional qualitative interviews may be completed&#xD;
      individually for participants (age ≥ 12 years, n=30) with P/LP variants (and who are aware of&#xD;
      their result status) and their parents (n=30) to obtain more open-ended information about the&#xD;
      impact of genetic testing result disclosure, family communication about testing results, and&#xD;
      their perception of result implications.&#xD;
