  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition and unintentional weight loss are highly prevalent among patients with heart&#xD;
      failure (HF), with approximately 50% of patients with heart failure meeting malnutrition&#xD;
      criteria. Poor dietary quality and micronutrient deficiencies are associated with higher&#xD;
      rates of HF hospitalization and mortality. Therefore nutritional interventions to improve&#xD;
      dietary quality and prevent malnutrition development may represent an effective strategy to&#xD;
      improve HF-related health status and survival outcomes. To date, there are no large clinical&#xD;
      trials investigating the efficacy of 'food as medicine' to improve morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The investigators&#xD;
      plan to conduct a single-center, randomized pilot trial to assess the tolerability,&#xD;
      feasibility, and efficacy of providing medically-tailored meals (MTMs) to patients with HFrEF&#xD;
      and malnutrition. The investigators hypothesize that home delivery of MTMs will be feasible,&#xD;
      well-tolerated and achieve a high degree of satisfaction for patients with HFrEF. The&#xD;
      proposed pilot study is a randomized crossover trial, in which each subject receives a&#xD;
      12-week standard of care phase with self-directed dietary intake and a 12-week MTM dietary&#xD;
      intervention phase, with a 4-week washout period between the two phases. Meals will be&#xD;
      designed, prepared and delivered by our community based organized partner, Community&#xD;
      Servings. The investigators will measure HF-related health status, functional capacity, and&#xD;
      biomarkers of heart failure and nutritional status before and after each study phase. The&#xD;
      proposed study will facilitate a larger future randomized trial of MTM for patients with&#xD;
      HFrEF and malnutrition, powered to examine the impact on HF hospitalizations and mortality.&#xD;

      The investigators plan to conduct a single-center, randomized pilot trial to assess the&#xD;
      tolerability, feasibility, and efficacy of providing medically-tailored meals (MTMs) to&#xD;
      patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and malnutrition. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that MTMs will improve symptomatology, functional capacity, and&#xD;
      serum biomarkers of heart failure in this patient population. There are two primary&#xD;
      objectives for this pilot study: 1) confirm tolerability, feasibility, and efficacy of&#xD;
      prescribing MTMs, and 2) measure changes in functional capacity, patient-reported health&#xD;
      status, and biomarkers of nutritional status and heart failure over the course of the study&#xD;
      period. For this proposed study, the investigators will test the following elements of this&#xD;
      central hypothesis with 2 aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 Tolerability, feasibility, and efficacy of prescribing medically-tailored meals:&#xD;
      Tolerability will be assessed with the validated 28-item dietary satisfaction score&#xD;
      (DSat-28). Efficacy will be assessed by improvement in patient-reported health status&#xD;
      questionnaires and feasibility will be assessed by the macronutrient intakes achieved on&#xD;
      facilitated food recalls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 Functional capacity and serum biomarkers of nutrition/heart failure: Determine whether&#xD;
      medically tailored meals improve symptomatology, functional capacity, and serum biomarkers of&#xD;
      nutrition and heart failure in patients with advanced heart failure.&#xD;
