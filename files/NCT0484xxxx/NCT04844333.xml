  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study analyzed the relationship between extubation timing and Emergence agitation in&#xD;
      18-60 years old adults undergoing nasal surgery, such as nasal septum correction, endoscopic&#xD;
      sinus surgery, and nasal bone fracture reduction. The number of agitation, sedation score,&#xD;
      pain score, operation method, analgesic drugs and other data were recorded to analyze the&#xD;
      effect of deep anesthesia extubation on agitation in patients with nasal surgery. It also&#xD;
      provides a clinical basis for the prevention and treatment of agitation during the recovery&#xD;
      period of such operations in adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nasal surgery is an operation with a high proportion of pain and agitation found in the&#xD;
      clinical medical treatment of our hospital. Although the operation time is short, the&#xD;
      operation trauma is small, and it does not involve important organs and blood vessels, the&#xD;
      clinical observation shows that the incidence of agitation in such patients after operation&#xD;
      is high, and the degree of pain varies greatly. Many studies have analyzed the related risk&#xD;
      factors of agitation in the wake-up period of adult nasal surgery, and believe that the&#xD;
      existence of postoperative endotracheal tube is the main risk factor. However, there is a&#xD;
      lack of prospective randomized controlled study on the timing of postoperative extubation in&#xD;
      patients with nasal surgery. Therefore, this study analyzes the impact of extubation timing&#xD;
      on postoperative agitation, so as to clarify the correlation between postoperative agitation&#xD;
      and extubation timing and possible protective factors, which is helpful to early prediction,&#xD;
      prevention and treatment, and reduce the incidence of postoperative EA in patients with nasal&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
