      The primary objective of this study is to determine the vaccine effectiveness of 2 doses of&#xD;
      Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine against COVID-19-associated hospitalization. There will be a&#xD;
      large retrospective database study using two parallel study designs: a test-negative&#xD;
      case-control design and a retrospective cohort design. Exploratory analyses of VE estimates&#xD;
      by strain type will be conducted.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of 2-doses&#xD;
      of Pfizer's BNT162b2 vaccine against COVID-19-associated hospitalization. In addition, VE of&#xD;
      1 dose and at least one dose will be determined. Other outcomes in addition to&#xD;
      hospitalization to be assessed include COVID-19-associated ED admissions, ICU admissions,&#xD;
      outpatient visits and death. To assess VE, we propose a large retrospective database study&#xD;
      using two parallel study designs: a test-negative case-control design and a retrospective&#xD;
      cohort design. The test-negative design (TND) will assess VE against COVID-19 hospitalization&#xD;
      (primary endpoint) and emergency department (ED) admission. The retrospective cohort analysis&#xD;
      will assess VE against COVID-19 hospitalization (primary), ICU admission, death, ED&#xD;
      admission, and outpatient disease (with no subsequent hospitalization within 14 days). We&#xD;
      will further conduct exploratory analyses of VE estimates by strain type.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria Test Negative Design&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  KPSC patients 16 years or older who are admitted to the hospital (primary objective)&#xD;
             with acute respiratory infection (ARI) after 14 December 2020 (date of first&#xD;
             vaccinations at KPSC), and who receive a PCR test for SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For secondary objectives estimating VE against ED admission, the TND will include KPSC&#xD;
             patients 16 years or older who present to the ED with ARI after 14 December 2020, and&#xD;
             who receive a PCR test for SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Membership requirement of 6 months prior to index date, which is de-fined as the date&#xD;
             of hospitalization or ED admission (allowing 31-day administrative gap), to facilitate&#xD;
             accurate capture of comorbid conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inclusion Criteria Cohort Design&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All KPSC members as of 14 December 2020 (date of first Pfizer vaccination at KPSC) who&#xD;
             are age 16 and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have at least 6 months of membership (allowing 31-day administrative&#xD;
             gap) prior to 14 December 2020 (index date, date vaccinations first began at KPSC) to&#xD;
             facilitate accurate capture of comorbid conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria Test Negative Design • Patients who receive any other newly licensed or&#xD;
        investigational SARS-CoV-2 vaccine or COVID-19 prophylactic agent other than Pfizer's&#xD;
        COVID-19 vaccine prior to hospitalization (or ED, for secondary objective) will be excluded&#xD;
        from the analysis. Patients will also be excluded if the index date is within certain time&#xD;
        windows from vaccination date.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria Cohort Design&#xD;
&#xD;
        • There will be no exclusion criteria for the cohort design, however patients will be&#xD;
        censored for receiving any other newly licensed or investigational SARS-CoV-2 vaccine or&#xD;
        COVID-19 prophylactic agent other than Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine. Patients will also be&#xD;
        censored if the event (hospitalization, ED encounter, etc.) occurs within certain time&#xD;
        windows from vaccination date.&#xD;
