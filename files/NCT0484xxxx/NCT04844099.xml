  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle Cell Anaemia (SCA) is an inherited disease that makes the body produce red blood cells&#xD;
      with abnormal sickle-shaped cells. The sickle-shaped cells are rigid, not flexible and break&#xD;
      up easily resulting in anaemia. The abnormal cells also stick to the vessel walls, causing a&#xD;
      blockage that slows or stops the flow of blood. When this happens, oxygen cannot reach nearby&#xD;
      tissues. The lack of oxygen can cause attacks of sudden, severe pain, called pain crises,&#xD;
      stroke or damage to important organs such as the spleen. All of these can lead to death.&#xD;
      These attacks can occur without warning and are often started and made worse by infections&#xD;
      such as malaria. Therefore, in many countries in Africa where malaria is common, children&#xD;
      with SCA are given malaria medicines to prevent the infection. However, many of the medicines&#xD;
      do not work effectively, are too difficult to take or they have side effects, resulting in&#xD;
      poor adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to find safe, acceptable and effective medicines for malaria&#xD;
      prevention in children with SCA in eastern and southern Africa. The investigators propose to&#xD;
      conduct a study to find out whether giving weekly doses of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine,&#xD;
      also called DP, is safe, more effective, acceptable and cost-effective than the current&#xD;
      strategy of monthly sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) to prevent malaria in children with&#xD;
      sickle cell anaemia. Overall, 548 children aged 6 months to 15 years will be chosen randomly&#xD;
      to receive either weekly DP or monthly SP for about 18 months. To test if the study medicine&#xD;
      is effective, the study will compare the case burden of malaria. The investigators will also&#xD;
      monitor every child for any type of illness, blood transfusions and other complications of&#xD;
      sickle cell anaemia and admissions to the hospital. In addition, the study will evaluate the&#xD;
      impact of DP on the development of resistance by malaria parasites. The study will also&#xD;
      include nested safety studies on the effect of DP on the heart. All study participants will&#xD;
      receive all the other usual care and treatments, including patient education on home care,&#xD;
      and daily penicillin if younger than 5 years. If proven safe and efficacious,&#xD;
      chemoprophylaxis with DP may decrease the incidence of malaria in children with SCA, prevent&#xD;
      ill-health and deaths, and improve wellbeing.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An estimated 300,000 babies are born with Sickle Cell Anaemia (SCA) annually. Affected&#xD;
      children have chronic ill health and many suffer a premature death. Ill health is commonly&#xD;
      precipitated by febrile illnesses including malaria. Antimalarial chemoprophylaxis is an&#xD;
      important strategy, but current regimes are either sub-optimally effective (e.g., monthly&#xD;
      sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, SP) or difficult to adhere to (e.g., daily proguanil). The&#xD;
      investigators propose dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) as the agent with the most&#xD;
      potential to be used across Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our objective is to determine the efficacy, safety, uptake, and cost-effectiveness of malaria&#xD;
      chemoprevention with weekly single day courses of DP vs monthly single day courses of SP in&#xD;
      children with SCA in eastern and southern Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that weekly single day courses of DP, is safe and more efficacious,&#xD;
      compared to monthly single day courses of SP, for the malaria chemoprevention in children&#xD;
      with SCA in eastern and southern Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will a randomised, double-blind controlled parallel-group superiority trial of weekly&#xD;
      single day courses of DP for an average of 18 months compared to monthly single-day courses&#xD;
      of SP in SCA patients. The study will be conducted in Uganda and Malawi. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomised to DP or SP (1:1), stratified by bodyweight and study centre. The study will also&#xD;
      assess the acceptability and uptake of the two interventions, the safety and pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      of weekly DP, the development of resistance to DP and cost-effectiveness. At the end of the&#xD;
      study, this information will be used to inform regional health policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sites:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from Jinja Regional Referral hospital and Kitgum General&#xD;
      hospital in Uganda and Queen Elizabeth (Blantyre) hospital in Malawi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be oral DP administered weekly for an average of 18 months based on&#xD;
      weight categories. DP will be provided as tablets of D-ARTEPP® (Guilin Pharmaceutical Co.&#xD;
      Ltd) and administered as dihydroartemisinin (20mg) and piperaquine (160 mg) at approximate&#xD;
      doses of dihydroartemisinin 2.5mg/kg/day and piperaquine 20mg/kg/day. The active control will&#xD;
      be the current standard of care for chemoprevention in Uganda and Malawi - monthly&#xD;
      single-dose SP (S=25mg/kg). The same manufacturer will provide SP as the generic SP (in&#xD;
      500/25mg scored tablets).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the above-mentioned malaria regimens, the participants will receive the&#xD;
      standard of care for Sickle Cell Anaemia (including parental education on care, treatment for&#xD;
      both the acute and chronic complications of Sickle Cell Anaemia, and daily penicillin&#xD;
      prophylaxis if &lt;5 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the minimum incidence rate of clinical malaria in SCA patients receiving monthly SP&#xD;
      estimated at 0.2 events per year, and an effect size of 50% if DP is used, at a power of 0.9&#xD;
      and 0.05 level of significance, followed up for 18 months and allowing for 20% losses to&#xD;
      follow up, and one interim analysis, the investigators will need 548 participants (274 in&#xD;
      either arm) followed up for an average 18 months or until 824 person-years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed for up for an average of 18 months or until 412 person-years of&#xD;
      observation is achieved in each group (a combined total of 824 person-years of observation).&#xD;
      This will be achieved by following between 548 and 824 participants for an average of 12 to&#xD;
      18 months each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy outcome measures will be the incidence of clinical malaria. Secondary&#xD;
      efficacy outcomes will include the incidence of malaria parasitaemia, all-cause sick-child&#xD;
      clinic visits, SCA-related vaso-occlusive events (including severe pain events and&#xD;
      dactylitis), acute chest syndrome, stroke, hospitalisations, blood-transfusions, and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary safety outcome measures: QTc-prolongation on ECG recordings and incidence of&#xD;
      serious cardiac adverse events (e.g., convulsions or syncope within 48 hours after drug&#xD;
      intake). Tolerance: % vomiting drug within 30 minutes of administration. Others are&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness, development of resistance to piperaquine, feasibility, acceptability, and&#xD;
      uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: Primary analysis will be by intention to treat. Incidence rates will be&#xD;
      calculated, and rate ratios estimated using Poisson regression, with treatment (as&#xD;
      randomised) as the predictor variable and the stratification factors site and weight-band as&#xD;
      covariates.&#xD;
