  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial to evaluate the efficacy,&#xD;
      tolerability, and safety of ESO-101 in adult patients with active eosinophilic esophagitis&#xD;
      (EoE). Patients will be screened at 2 visits (Visit 1 and Visit 2) during which their&#xD;
      eligibility will be assessed based on endoscopy-independent criteria (Visit 1) and based on&#xD;
      the histologic assessment of esophageal biopsy samples taken during the screening endoscopy&#xD;
      (Visit 2). Eligible patients will be randomized 2:1 to once-daily treatment with ESO-101 or&#xD;
      placebo and treated for 28 days starting on Day 0. Further clinic visits will be performed at&#xD;
      Day 14 (Visit 4) and Day 28 (Visit 5, end of treatment) to assess the efficacy, tolerability,&#xD;
      and safety. In addition, a safety follow-up call will be scheduled 2 weeks after the end of&#xD;
      treatment (Day 42, Visit 6).&#xD;

    <description>The processing and analysis of biopsy samples taken at Visit 2 and end of treatment (Visit 5) will be performed blinded at a central laboratory according to a laboratory manual.

    <time_frame>From Baseline (Visit 3) to end of treatment (Visit 5 = 28 days after Visit 3)</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will rate the dysphagia severity score daily on a 11-point NRS (numeric rating scale): 0 = 'no symptoms' to 10 = 'worst possible symptoms'. At Visit 3 (Day 0) and Visit 5 (end of treatment), the worst severity scores out of the 7 days preceding the respective visit will be used for the assessment. The score assessed at Visit 3 (Day 0) at the center before IMP intake will serve as baseline score. Patients will additionally assess the severity score of the actual day in the patient diary daily after IMP intake starting on Day 0.</description>

    <description>The EREFS score (Eosinophilic esophagitis endoscopic reference score) is a classification and grading system for the endoscopic assessment of the esophageal features of eosinophilic esophagitis.
