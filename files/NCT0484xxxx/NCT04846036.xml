      This a randomized placebo controlled, double-blind phase II study to explore the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of sonlicromanol in children (from birth to 17 years)&#xD;
      with genetically confirmed mitochondrial disease of which the gene defect is known to&#xD;
      decrease one or more oxidative phosphorylation system enzymes and who suffer from motor&#xD;
      symptoms (&quot;KHENERGYC&quot;).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mitochondrial Diseases (MD) are rare progressive, multi-system, often early onset and fatal&#xD;
      disorders affecting both children and adults. Despite advances in the understanding of&#xD;
      mitochondrial disorders, treatment options are extremely limited and, to date, largely&#xD;
      supportive. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel treatments. Sonlicromanol (KH176) is&#xD;
      an orally bio-available small molecule under development for the treatment of these&#xD;
      disorders. The current study will explore the pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      sonlicromanol in children (from birth to 17 years) with genetically confirmed mitochondrial&#xD;
      disease of which the gene defect is known to decrease one or more oxidative phosphorylation&#xD;
      system enzymes and who suffer from motor symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of sonlicromanol on motor&#xD;
      symptom severity in children with genetically confirmed mitochondrial disease affecting&#xD;
      oxidative phosphorylation during a 6 month treatment period (GMFM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial consists of 2 phases, with the main phase being a randomized placebo controlled,&#xD;
      double-blind, phase II parallel group study to explore the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      sonlicromanol in twenty-four (24) children with mitochondrial disease and motor symptoms,.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first phase is an adaptive PharmacoKinetics (PK) study with 4 days treatment (to expected&#xD;
      steady state in most subjects) in the following age-groups: birth - 1 year, 1-2 years, 2- 6&#xD;
      years, 6-12 years, and 12 - 17 years. An age group should have at least 3 subjects before&#xD;
      being analysed. Subjects will take 4 days of open-label sonlicromanol orally at the&#xD;
      anticipated adult-equivalent dose. After completion of enrolment in an age group, the PK data&#xD;
      from that age group will be analysed to confirm the adult-equivalent dose that will be used&#xD;
      thereafter in the second phase of the trial. Older age groups will be studied before younger&#xD;
      age groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second phase subjects will be randomized (by age group) over 2 groups. Group 1 will&#xD;
      receive an adult-equivalent dose of sonlicromanol twice daily orally for 26 weeks. Group 2&#xD;
      will receive matching placebo twice daily for 26 weeks. A final follow-up visit is scheduled&#xD;
      2 weeks after the intake of the last dose of the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Subject Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall study duration of the trial for a eligible subject is estimated to be&#xD;
      approximately 7 months, consisting of up to 4 weeks screening, 26 weeks (6 months) of&#xD;
      treatment and 2 week post-treatment follow-up. At the end of the study treatment all&#xD;
      participants will be offered to continue treatment with sonlicromanol during a open label&#xD;
      extension (OLE) trial for 12 months.&#xD;

    <measure>Spasticity as assessed with the Modified Tardieu Scale for spasticity (MTS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1), week 6, week 13, week 27, week 29</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline to each assessment of the MTS. The MTS quantifies spasticity by assessing the muscle's response to stretch applied at three specified velocities (as slow as possible; speed of limb falling under gravity; moving as fast as possible) and rating the intensity and duration of the muscle reaction to stretch and the joint angle. The quality of the muscle reaction (spasticity grade) is scored on a 5-grade scale (range: 'No resistance throughout the course of the movement' to 'Joint immovable'). Lower scores denote better performance. The Spasticity Angle X is the difference between the angles of arrest at slow speed and of catch-and release or clonus at fast speed; the Spasticity Grade Y is an ordinal variable that grades the intensity (gain) of the muscle reaction to fast stretch. The outcome parameter of angle (in degrees, range: 0-180 degrees) can only be determined with spasticity grade 2 and higher.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age between 0 months and 17 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Genetically confirmed mitochondrial disease, of which the gene defect is known to&#xD;
             decrease one or more oxidative phosphorylation system enzymes and who suffer from&#xD;
             motor symptoms, based on investigator judgement&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Abnormal gross motor function and/or presence of at least one clinically significant&#xD;
             motor symptom (hypotonia, decreased muscle strength, ataxia, dystonia, chorea and/or&#xD;
             spasticity) based on investigator judgement&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Before enrollment in the adaptive PK phase and before randomization into the&#xD;
             double-blind placebo-controlled phase: Gross Motor Function Measure-88 (GMFM-88) Total&#xD;
             Score ≤96%&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Before enrollment in the adaptive PK phase and before randomization into the&#xD;
             double-blind placebo-controlled phase: International Paediatric Mitochondrial Disease&#xD;
             Scale IPMDS Score ≥10&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Stable disease symptoms since the previous routine control visit (consistent with a&#xD;
             score of &quot;stable&quot; on the item &quot;disease course since previous IPMDS&quot; of the IPMDS) in&#xD;
             the opinion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Written informed (patient/parental/caregiver) consent, able and willing to comply with&#xD;
             the study requirements of the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Women of childbearing potential must be willing to use highly effective contraceptive&#xD;
             methods during the entire study, i.e. combined (estrogen and progestogen containing)&#xD;
             oral, intravaginal or transdermal hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of&#xD;
             ovulation; oral, injectable, or or implantable progestogen-only hormonal contraception&#xD;
             associated with inhibition of ovulation; use of an intrauterine device; an&#xD;
             intrauterine hormone releasing system, bilateral tubal occlusion and vasectomy of the&#xD;
             partner. Any hormonal contraception method must be supplemented with a barrier method&#xD;
             (preferably male condom). Vasectomised partner is considered a highly effective birth&#xD;
             control method provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the subject and&#xD;
             that the vasectomised partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success.&#xD;
             Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as&#xD;
             refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated&#xD;
             with the study treatments. Reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in&#xD;
             in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual&#xD;
             lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
             symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
             contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note 1: Natural family planning methods, female condom, cervical cap or diaphragm are not&#xD;
        considered adequate contraceptive methods in the context of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note 2: To be considered not of childbearing potential, potential female subjects must have&#xD;
        been surgically sterilized (bilateral tubal ligation, hysterectomy or bilateral&#xD;
        oophorectomy) for at least 6 months prior to Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note 3: KH176 has been shown non-genotoxic judged from the Ames test, Chromosomal&#xD;
        Aberration test and in vivo Micronucleus test. Moreover, appreciable systemic exposure from&#xD;
        the exposure to (~2.5 mL) semen is extremely unlikely. However, until reproductive&#xD;
        toxicology studies have confirmed that KH176 does not adversely affect normal reproduction&#xD;
        in adult males and females, as well as causing developmental toxicity in the offspring, the&#xD;
        following contraceptive precautions must be adhered to:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential must be willing to use&#xD;
             condoms during the entire study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  female partners of childbearing potential of male subjects must be willing to use&#xD;
             adequate contraceptive methods during the entire study, i.e., a hormonal contraceptive&#xD;
             method (pill, vaginal ring, patch, implant, injectable, hormone-medicated intrauterine&#xD;
             device) or an intrauterine device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Surgery of the gastro-intestinal tract with removal of piece(s) of stomach, duodenum&#xD;
             or jejunum that might interfere with absorption. Feeding through gastrostomy tube is&#xD;
             however allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Treatment with an investigational product within 3 months or 5 times the half-life of&#xD;
             the investigational product (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of the study&#xD;
             medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Clinically relevant cardiovascular disease or risk factors for arrythmia:&#xD;

                  sex-dependent QTc interval (https://www.qtcalculator.org) and/or abnormal&#xD;
                  structural or functional 2D ECHO&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) above the 95th percentile for the sex, age group&#xD;

                  hypercalcemia (local laboratory normal values; to be judged by investigator)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Clinically relevant abnormal laboratory results:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) or alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) &gt; 3 times&#xD;

                  ALAT &gt; 3 x ULN but &lt; 3.5 x ULN, re-assessment is allowed at the investigator's&#xD;
                  discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Estimated glomerular filtration rate below age-appropriate limits (according to&#xD;
                  the formula: 40.9* ((1.8 / Cystatine C)0.93):&#xD;

                  the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of hypersensitivity or idiosyncrasy to any of the components of the&#xD;
             investigational product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Medical history of drug abuse (illegal drugs such as cannabinoids, amphetamines,&#xD;
             cocaine, opiates or problematic use of prescription drugs such as benzodiazepines,&#xD;
             opiates).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The use of any of the following medication and/or supplements within 4 weeks or 5&#xD;
             times the half-life (whichever is longer) prior to the first dosing of the study&#xD;
             medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. (multi)vitamins, co-enzyme Q10, Vitamin E, riboflavin, and antioxidant&#xD;

                  month before first dosing and remaining stable throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Note: thus, mitoQ and any medication negatively influencing mitochondrial&#xD;
                  functioning are allowed as long as the dose has been stable for at least one&#xD;
