  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Affecting nearly 800,000 people in the US every year, stroke is a leading cause of long-term&#xD;
      disability, and has serious consequences for stroke survivors and their carepartners. Our&#xD;
      project uses a scientifically rigorous efficacy study to evaluate a remotely delivered 8-week&#xD;
      dyadic (couples-based) positive psychology intervention to reduce emotional distress in&#xD;
      stroke survivors and their carepartners. If successful, couples may be better emotionally&#xD;
      equipped to cope with the sequelae of stroke, and have better rehabilitation outcomes and&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The impact of stroke is shared between the stroke survivor and their spousal/partner&#xD;
      caregiver (carepartner). An estimated 30-50% of stroke survivors and carepartners experience&#xD;
      depressive or anxiety symptoms that negatively affect rehabilitation outcomes and quality of&#xD;
      life. Yet, interventions to support couples post-stroke are largely insufficient or&#xD;
      inaccessible. To address this need, we developed a novel remotely-delivered dyadic&#xD;
      intervention to promote Resilience in Stroke survivor-carepartner Dyads (ReStoreD), in which&#xD;
      couples learn and practice goal-setting, communication strategies, and positive psychology&#xD;
      activities like expressing gratitude, finding meaning, and fostering connections. Preliminary&#xD;
      pilot study results were promising, showing reduced depressive symptoms and increased&#xD;
      resilience in participants. The purpose of the current study is to conduct a Stage II&#xD;
      efficacy trial of the 8-week ReStoreD intervention with a sample of 200 dyads (n=400)&#xD;
      consisting of one individual who has sustained an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke between 3&#xD;
      months and 3 years prior to enrollment and a cohabitating carepartner. Using a fully-powered,&#xD;
      randomized waitlist-control design, we will determine efficacy of ReStoreD to reduce&#xD;
      emotional distress in both dyad members (Aim 1). We will also examine effects of ReStoreD on&#xD;
      secondary outcomes (resilience, relationship quality, stress-related stroke, meaningful&#xD;
      activity engagement) as potential mediators (Aim 2), and explore moderators to determine&#xD;
      whether certain subgroups respond better to the intervention (Aim 3). All participants will&#xD;
      complete standardized, validated assessments at baseline, 8 weeks, 16 weeks, and 6-month&#xD;
      follow up. All aspects of the study, including intervention activities and assessments, are&#xD;
      conducted remotely, online.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first rigorously designed efficacy trial to test a positive psychology&#xD;
      intervention for stroke survivors and their carepartners. When the aims of this study are&#xD;
      realized, we will 1) have a remotely-delivered, dyadic intervention to support couples&#xD;
      post-stroke; 2) have a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the intervention's&#xD;
      effect on emotional distress, and can use this information to inform future interventions;&#xD;
      and 3) be able to identify a more specific target population for whom the intervention works&#xD;
      best. Ultimately, if found efficacious, this intervention will offer sustainable and&#xD;
      accessible support for couples who are coping with stroke to improve rehabilitation outcomes&#xD;
      and quality of life.&#xD;

    <description>ReStoreD is a remotely-administered behavioral intervention in which couples coping with stroke learn and practice goal-setting, communication strategies, and positive psychology activities, such as expressing gratitude, finding meaning, and fostering connections. Participants are provided with 8 weekly modules, each featuring two components: 1) psychoeducational materials, such as an informational video and resources/links about a general topic related to resilience, coping, and/or overall well-being of the individual and couple, and 2) examples of positive psychology activities that relate to the week's theme or topic. Participants are asked to complete at least two positive psychology activities alone and two together each week.</description>

        The target population is community-dwelling couples coping with stroke. We will enroll 200&#xD;
        dyads (n=400) consisting of one individual who had an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke and a&#xD;
        cohabitating spousal or partner caregiver (carepartner).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  (1) The ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke must have occurred between 3 months and 3 years&#xD;
             prior to enrollment; (2) the adult couple must have been living together since before&#xD;
             the stroke and for at least 6 months prior to enrollment; (3) one or both partners&#xD;
             must report some anxiety and/or depressive symptoms; and (4) participants must be able&#xD;
             to read, understand, and follow instructions, and be able to provide their own&#xD;
             consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Either dyad partner has significant aphasia, visual, psychiatric, and/or significant&#xD;
             cognitive impairment that would limit their ability to participate in the intervention&#xD;
             in a meaningful way.&#xD;
