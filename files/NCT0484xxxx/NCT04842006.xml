  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rectal cancer represents the most complex area of multidisciplinary treatment in bowel&#xD;
      surgery. In 2017, there were 1221 new rectal cancers in Finland. The prognosis of colorectal&#xD;
      cancer (CRC) patients these days is almost exclusively driven by the occurrence of the&#xD;
      metastatic form of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of rectal cancer often includes a long delay between diagnosis and the&#xD;
      initiation of systemic chemotherapy, increasing risk for systemic metastases for those at&#xD;
      high risk. On the other hand, the waiting time during pretreatment before surgery enables&#xD;
      comprehensive systematic characterization of the primary tumor status before the decisions on&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy, opening a window to the use of precision in decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomized controlled treatment trial, outcomes of novel precision methods to select&#xD;
      right rectal cancer patients for treatment that they need will be compared to conventional&#xD;
      treatment. The study aims to reduce over-treatment of those that most likely do not benefit&#xD;
      from additional treatments. With the overall aim to reduce metastatic form of the disease,&#xD;
      patients with high-risk features will be randomized to a treatment strategy with early&#xD;
      systemic control by chemotherapy followed by circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and&#xD;
      organoid-guided adjuvant therapy, or to conventional treatment strategy. Both&#xD;
      state-of-the-art laboratory practice and routine diagnostic clinical pipelines are introduced&#xD;
      to bring future diagnostic models of minimal residual disease and chemoresistance closer to&#xD;
      current practice. The outcomes will reveal the clinical benefit of such strategy by&#xD;
      recurrence-free survival at highest level of evidence, and produce important clinical outcome&#xD;
      data on the application of ctDNA in everyday cancer treatment practice. The translational&#xD;
      data on the use of ctDNA organoids to inform treatment decision and regimen selection will&#xD;
      build knowledge of the use of such biomarkers as tools for clinical practice and clinical&#xD;
      research. The results will be scalable worldwide in the practice of rectal cancer treatment.&#xD;
