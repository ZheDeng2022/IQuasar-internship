  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung involvement in Sjögren's syndrome is common and causes reduced quality of life and&#xD;
      increased mortality. Sjögren's syndrome-related lung diseases (SS-RLD) are classified and&#xD;
      treated as the primary lung diseases they resemble. Whether this approach is optimal has not&#xD;
      been evaluated thoroughly. A critical gap in knowledge is knowing whether SS-RLDs have a&#xD;
      unique clinical course and response to therapy. Given the underlying immune system&#xD;
      dysfunction in Sjögren's syndrome, we hypothesize that patients with SS-RLD will be more&#xD;
      likely to respond to immunosuppressive therapy than patients with the matching primary lung&#xD;
      disease. To address this hypothesis, we will prospectively screen for Sjogren's syndrome in&#xD;
      patients presenting to pulmonary clinics and compare the clinical course and response to&#xD;
      therapy in Sjogren's syndrome positive and negative patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sjögren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease affecting at least 1% of adults characterized by&#xD;
      hyperactive lymphocytes that damage exocrine glands leading to dry eyes and dry mouth.&#xD;
      Although less well recognized, lung involvement in Sjögren's syndrome is common and causes&#xD;
      reduced health-related quality of life and increased mortality. Sjögren's syndrome-related&#xD;
      lung diseases are classified and treated as the primary lung diseases they resemble. Whether&#xD;
      this approach is optimal has not been evaluated thoroughly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the potentially life-threatening consequence of Sjögren's syndrome-related lung&#xD;
      disease, general medical education still promotes the false idea that Sjögren's syndrome is a&#xD;
      nuisance disease. This leads many clinicians to overlook Sjögren's syndrome as a possible&#xD;
      cause for respiratory symptoms. Even when Sjögren's syndrome is identified, there is no&#xD;
      standard for attribution of the lung disease and little data on how to best treat it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only one study has compared interstitial lung disease patients with and without Sjögren's&#xD;
      syndrome. Although it was a small retrospective study, it found that patients with usual&#xD;
      interstitial pneumonia and Sjögren's syndrome were more likely to achieve stable lung&#xD;
      function with immunosuppressive therapy as compared to the idiopathic cohort.1 This is&#xD;
      striking as usual interstitial pneumonia is generally thought to not be responsive to&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A critical gap in knowledge is knowing whether Sjögren's syndrome-related lung diseases have&#xD;
      a unique clinical course and response to therapy. Given the underlying immune system&#xD;
      dysfunction in Sjögren's syndrome, we hypothesize that patients with Sjögren's&#xD;
      syndrome-related lung disease will be more likely to respond to immunosuppressive therapy&#xD;
      than patients with the matching primary lung disease.&#xD;
