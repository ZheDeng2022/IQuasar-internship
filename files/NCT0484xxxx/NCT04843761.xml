    <textblock>
      This study looks at the safety and effectiveness of different drugs in treating COVID-19 in&#xD;
      people who have been hospitalized with the infection and who have acute respiratory failure.&#xD;
      Participants in the study will be treated with either a study drug plus current standard of&#xD;
      care (SOC), or with placebo plus current SOC.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a master protocol to evaluate the safety and efficacy of investigational agents aimed&#xD;
      at improving outcomes for patients with acute respiratory failure related to COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trials within this protocol will be adaptive, randomized, blinded and initially&#xD;
      placebo-controlled. Participants will receive standard of care (SOC) treatment as part of the&#xD;
      protocol. If an investigational agent shows superiority over placebo, SOC for the study of&#xD;
      future investigational agents may be modified accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The international trials within this protocol will be conducted in up to several hundred&#xD;
      clinical sites. Participating sites are affiliated with networks funded by the United States&#xD;
      National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the US Department of Veterans Affairs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol is for a phase III platform study that allows investigational drugs to be added&#xD;
      and dropped during the course of the study. This allows for efficient testing of new drugs&#xD;
      against control within the same trial infrastructure. When more than one agent is being&#xD;
      tested concurrently, participants may be randomly allocated across agents (as well as between&#xD;
      the agent and its placebo) so the same control group can be shared, when feasible. In some&#xD;
      situations, a factorial design may be used to study multiple agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed for 90 days following randomization for the primary endpoint&#xD;
      and most secondary endpoints. Selected secondary endpoints will be measured at 180 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is planned to provide 80% power to detect an odds ratio of 1.5 for improvement in&#xD;
      recovery status at Day 90 for an investigational agent versus placebo with use of the ordinal&#xD;
      outcome. The planned sample size is 640 participants (320 per group) for each investigational&#xD;
      agent/placebo. Sample size may be re-estimated before enrollment is complete based on an&#xD;
      assessment of whether the pooled proportions of the outcome are still consistent with&#xD;
      adequate power for the hypothesized difference measured by the odds ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified by study site pharmacy and by receipt of invasive mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, or ECMO at enrollment. Other agent-specific stratification factors may be&#xD;
      considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational agents suitable for testing in the inpatient setting will be prioritized&#xD;
      based on in vitro data, preclinical data, phase I pharmacokinetic and safety data, and&#xD;
      clinical data from completed and ongoing trials. In some cases, a vanguard cohort/initial&#xD;
      pilot phase may be incorporated into the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review interim safety and&#xD;
      efficacy data at least monthly. Pre-specified guidelines will be established to recommend&#xD;
      early stopping of the trial for evidence of harm or substantial efficacy. The DSMB may&#xD;
      recommend discontinuation of an investigational agent if the risks are judged to outweigh the&#xD;
      benefits.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Previous enrollment in TESICO&#xD;
&#xD;
        Agent-specific exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior receipt of any dose of remdesivir during present illness (remdesivir agent).&#xD;

             agent).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ALT (alanine aminotransferase) or AST (aspartate aminotransferase) &gt; 10 times upper&#xD;
             limit of normal (remdesivir agent).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unwillingness to commit to avoid sex that may result in pregnancy for at least 7 days&#xD;
             after completion of remdesivir vs. placebo (remdesivir agent).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Refractory hypotension (aviptadil agent).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe diarrhea (Aviptadil agent).&#xD;
