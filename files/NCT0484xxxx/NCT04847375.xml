  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Covid-19 disease is one of the most important health system challenges which is the result of&#xD;
      the recent SARS CoV-2 virus outbreak. So far, despite the use of different types of&#xD;
      pharmaceuticals, none has been served as a curative treatment and research is continued to&#xD;
      find one or more effective drugs; either palliative or curative ones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most important clinical problems in Covid-19 patients is lung involvement, which&#xD;
      may causes significant sequels; leading to a main part of morbidity and/or mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surfactant is one of the drugs that can have valuable effects on the lungs, both by reducing&#xD;
      the alveolar surface tension and by exerting immunomodulatory effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous study by the same team, favorable effects were seen in intubated patients;&#xD;
      however, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of exogenous nebulized surfactant&#xD;
      in the pre-intubation stages of the disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exogenous surfactant in neonates with clinical pulmonary distress syndrome has demonstrated&#xD;
      pulmonary improvement; the latter being one of the most important applications of exogenous&#xD;
      surfactant. In adults with underlying lung disease, especially Adult Respiratory Distress&#xD;
      Syndrome (ARDS), there are controversial findings regarding the efficacy of surfactant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, in a previous study, it was shown that surfactant in COVID-19 patients with&#xD;
      pulmonary intubation improved pulmonary function and gas exchange and also, reduced patient&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, none of the other repurposed drugs in COVID-19 have yet been able to prove&#xD;
      significant effects in the treatment of patients; based on a recent study on more than 11000&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients (i.e. the SOLIDARITY study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the significant worldwide challnege with COVID-19, many efforts have been made in this&#xD;
      regard, but the definitive cure has not yet been obtained, and therefore, efforts are being&#xD;
      made to find an effective method to treat the disease and improve patients' symptoms;&#xD;
      parallel to the efforts to increase the vaccination coverage.&#xD;
