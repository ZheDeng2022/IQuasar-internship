  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research will be carried out in order to test the effect of Intramuscular (IM)&#xD;
      Diclofenac, administered as preemptive analgesic with minimal effective dose spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia in perianal surgeries, on prolonging the time to first request for analgesic and&#xD;
      lowering analgesic consumption. Investigators hypothesized that using IM Diclofenac in this&#xD;
      surgery will postpone the time to first analgesic request and will decrease the consumption&#xD;
      of post-operative analgesics. Our method includes dividing the patients into control and&#xD;
      study groups and recording the first analgesic request and post-operative analgesic&#xD;
      consumption after surgery and comparing the results.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Effective control of post-operative pain is an issue that has been repeatedly emphasized and&#xD;
      has received an increasing amount of attention in the past few years (1, 2). Opioids, despite&#xD;
      their side effects, are still the main cornerstone in managing acute postoperative pain (3).&#xD;
      Preemptive analgesia refers to the administration of effective analgesia prior to surgical&#xD;
      trauma. The main mechanism of preemptive analgesia is desensitization of the central nervous&#xD;
      system and prevention of pain before its onset. (3). Non-opioid preemptive analgesics are&#xD;
      commonly used to increase analgesic efficacy and patient satisfaction as well as to reduce&#xD;
      opioid consumption and side effects. Saddle anesthesia is a selective spinal anesthesia that&#xD;
      is commonly used for perianal surgeries (4-7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators previously performed a prospective up-down sequential allocation study to&#xD;
      evaluate the minimum effective dose of hyperbaric bupivacaine that is needed for inducing a&#xD;
      satisfactory and reliable saddle block for perianal surgeries that was restricted to the most&#xD;
      caudal spinal nerve roots (S4-coccygeal) that supply the perianal region (8). Although the&#xD;
      block produced no motor block in the lower limbs (thus allowing early ambulation), rapid&#xD;
      sensory recovery resulted in early request of analgesia and increased opioid consumption. In&#xD;
      this prospective, randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled clinical trial,&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that a single dose of IM diclofenac administered before spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia, will decrease postoperative pain, and delay and reduce postoperative analgesic&#xD;
      requirement in patients undergoing minor perianal surgeries under minimal effective-dose&#xD;
      bupivacaine saddle block&#xD;
