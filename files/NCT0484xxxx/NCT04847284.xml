  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) is a new alternative for local radiotherapy with the&#xD;
      advantages of dose escalation, reduced overall treatment time, and enhanced patient&#xD;
      convenience, however the degree of efficacy is unknown, as well as and which is the most&#xD;
      efficient dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IORT in patients with&#xD;
      surgical excision of brain metastases at a dose of 20 Gy is at least as effective and safe as&#xD;
      other forms of radiation therapy in patients with resection of brain metastases.&#xD;

      1. INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
           Brain metastases occur in roughly 30% of all cancer patients during their course of&#xD;
           disease. Their incidence is believed to rise due to the aging population that develops&#xD;
           more cancer per se, an increase in overall survival due to more effective extracranial&#xD;
           therapies but with only few (novel) substances crossing the blood-brain barrier and more&#xD;
           broadly available and more advanced imaging techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Neurosurgical treatment remains a cornerstone in the management of brain metastasis,&#xD;
           especially for lesions causing mass effects or neurological deficits or in case tissue&#xD;
           is necessary to establish a diagnosis. As local recurrence rates are as high as 50-60%&#xD;
           after surgical resection alone, adjuvant therapies to prevent such are necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) does not influence survival but rather impairs&#xD;
           neurocognitive functions and, as histologic in-depth exams of cavity borders showed that&#xD;
           most brain metastases infiltrate only 0.3-1.2 mm into the surrounding healthy brain&#xD;
           tissue, therefore treatment is to date usually confined to the cavity margin. Thus, the&#xD;
           currently recommended standard of care is post-operative stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)&#xD;
           to the resection cavity. One of the drawbacks of this modality is the incidence of&#xD;
           radionecrosis, especially in large tumor volumes. As an alternative to radiosurgery,&#xD;
           hypofractionated local radiotherapy is also used, reducing the risk of radionecrosis in&#xD;
           large volumes. There are no prospective randomized studies comparing both techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The need to find a modality of radiotherapy that achieves al least the efficacy of&#xD;
           radiosurgery or hypofractionated local radiotherapy, without the disadvantages thereof,&#xD;
           makes IORT as a possible treatment alternative.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IORT in patients&#xD;
           with surgical excision of brain metastases at a dose of 20 Gy is at least as effective&#xD;
           and safe as other forms of radiation therapy in patients with resection of brain&#xD;
           metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Median local progression free survival (lPFS), defined as time span (in months)&#xD;
                between surgery and recurrence within a 0,5 cm margin around the resection cavity,&#xD;
                assessed by serial MRI scans and RANO response assessment criteria for brain&#xD;
                metastases .&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Radiation-related (acute / late) neurotoxicity, assessed by regular neurological&#xD;
                examinations and serial MRI scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Median regional PFS (rPFS), resembling the time (in months) from surgery to any&#xD;
                progression outside of the 0,5 cm margin around the resection cavity, assessed by&#xD;
                serial MRI scans and RANO response assessment criteria for brain metastases .&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Global PFS (gPFS), defined as the time (in months) from surgery to any intra- and&#xD;
                extracranial tumor progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Median overall survival (OS), defined as the time (in months) from surgery of brain&#xD;
                metastases to death from by any cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is an open, single arm, single institution, prospective trial to determine the&#xD;
      efficiency and safety of IORT with low-energy photons to the cavity after resection of brain&#xD;
      metastases. A total of 25 patients will be included.&#xD;
