    <textblock>
      Experimental clinical study, with evaluation before and after intervention, for a determined&#xD;
      period of two years for data collection and one year for analysis and publication of results.&#xD;
      Included participants will be randomized and divided into a control group and an intervention&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with sequelae of pulmonary tuberculosis undergoing follow-up at the pulmonology&#xD;
      outpatient clinic will be invited to participate in this study, with an estimated sample of&#xD;
      60 participants, according to the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Inclusion: people diagnosed with treated pulmonary tuberculosis, with negative culture&#xD;
           in induced sputum; with pulmonary function report (spirometry), chest X-ray and complete&#xD;
           blood count with biochemistry updated in the last month, and in accordance with the&#xD;
           Informed Consent Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Exclusion: people with non-cooperative pulmonary tuberculosis, who present clinical&#xD;
           instability and / or musculoskeletal injury that compromises pulmonary rehabilitation&#xD;
           and limits the perception of physical capacity; with any comorbidities that may cause or&#xD;
           accentuate dyspnea; with stable angina, severe arrhythmias and / or heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocols:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Anamnesis and medical record examination&#xD;
&#xD;
           The anamnesis and examination of the medical records of the research participants will&#xD;
           be carried out through outpatient scheduling for adequate availability of the medical&#xD;
           records, by the main researcher. The evaluation will consist of searching for the&#xD;
           following main information: a) complaint and history of the disease; b) time of&#xD;
           diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis; c) medications used in the treatment; d) duration&#xD;
           of use of medications for treatment; e) age of the participant; and f) gender of the&#xD;
           participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
           The physical examination will consist of the analysis of the following data and&#xD;
           respective instruments and collection procedures: a) Anthropometry - the bioimpedance&#xD;
           equipment by tetrapolar technique (InBody 230® Bioscope - Seoul - Korea) will be used,&#xD;
           with bare feet, with light clothing and will consist of the verification of the&#xD;
           following data: body mass, body height and Body Mass Index (BMI); b) Systemic blood&#xD;
           pressure - measured using an aneroid sphygmomanometer, analog with a smaller division of&#xD;
           2 mmHg, Brand: Premium® (certified by INMETRO), applied to the left arm, associated with&#xD;
           the auscultatory method for determining systolic systemic blood pressure (SBP) and&#xD;
           systemic diastolic blood pressure (SBP); c) Partial oxygen saturation - measured using a&#xD;
           portable pulse oximeter (model 9500; Nonin Medical Inc., Minneapolis, USA), with a&#xD;
           sensor positioned on the 2nd finger of the right hand, the reading being determined&#xD;
           after signal stabilization, obtaining the partial arterial percentage of saturated&#xD;
           oxygen (SpO2); d) Heart rate (HR) - measured using a portable pulse oximeter (model&#xD;
           9500; Nonin Medical Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA), applied to the index finger of the left&#xD;
           hand, obtaining the number of heart beats in one minute (bpm); e) Respiratory frequency&#xD;
           (RF) - measured by counting by observing the thoracoabdominal movement of the number of&#xD;
           respiratory incursions in one minute (irpm); f) Pulmonary auscultation - verification of&#xD;
           lung sounds using a stethoscope; g) Cardiac auscultation - verification of cardiac&#xD;
           sounds through the use of a stethoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Complementary exams&#xD;
&#xD;
           They comprise routine examinations performed on these participants during the phase&#xD;
           preceding the research, for diagnosis and clinical treatment, therefore inserted only as&#xD;
           procedures for analysis of the reports and classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Simple chest X-rays, lateral and postero-anterior views, corresponding to the last month&#xD;
           of clinical treatment and submitted to the classification of the National Tuberculosis&#xD;
           Association (NTA) will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The pulmonary function tests or spirometry will be analyzed in accordance with the&#xD;
           Guidelines for Pulmonary Function Tests of the Brazilian Society of Pulmonology.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The analysis of the complete blood count and blood biochemistry will consist of the&#xD;
           observation between the normal values of the following items: hematocrit, total&#xD;
           leukocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, lipogram, glucose, glycated hemoglobin, albumin,&#xD;
           urea, creatinine, liver enzymes and C reactive protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Examination of mental status&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Mini Mental State Examination (Mini-mental) will be applied, a test that allows a&#xD;
           quick and objective assessment of the research participant's cognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Quality of life assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Questionnaire of the Hospital Saint George on Respiratory Illness (SGRQ) will be&#xD;
           applied, specific for assessing the quality of life in respiratory diseases that&#xD;
           addresses the impacts of the disease on individuals in three areas or domains: symptoms,&#xD;
           activity and psychosocial aspects. Another instrument used to assess quality of life is&#xD;
           the Short-Form 36 (SF-36), a generic questionnaire, self-administered or applied by&#xD;
           interview, consisting of 36 items that assess the domains: functional capacity, physical&#xD;
           aspects, pain, condition general health, vitality, social aspects, emotional aspects and&#xD;
           mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Functional assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
           The perception of effort will be measured by presenting the Modified Dyspnea Scale&#xD;
           (Borg). The Medical Research Council Classification for dyspnoea will also be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For the assessment of disabilities in instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs),&#xD;
           the scale developed by Lawton and Brody (1969) will be applied. The frailty assessment&#xD;
           will also be carried out on the research participants through the clinical frailty&#xD;
           scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Physical evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The six-minute walk test will be performed, a submaximal test used to assess the distance&#xD;
      covered by the participant in six uninterrupted minutes, with monitoring of blood pressure,&#xD;
      heart rate (HR), modified BORG scale and oxygen saturation (SpO2), in a 50-meter, flat&#xD;
      corridor, with demarcated distances meter by meter, following the recommendations of the&#xD;
      American Thoracic Society. The sit and stand test will also be applied five times, a&#xD;
      functional test that reproduces an everyday activity that particularly depends on the&#xD;
      strength of the muscles of the lower limbs and body balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Static spirometry test will be applied to assess respiratory muscle strength. This method is&#xD;
      performed by measuring the Maximum Inspiratory Pressure (MIP) and Maximum Expiratory Pressure&#xD;
      (MEP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess peripheral muscle strength, isokinetic dynamometry of the lower limbs will be used.&#xD;
      The equipment used will be the Biodex System® dynamometer. The participant will adopt the&#xD;
      sitting posture on the device with an inclination of +/- 100 degrees (internal angle), with&#xD;
      the motor axis aligned with the knee joint axis and stabilizations in the trunk, hip and&#xD;
      thigh to avoid compensations related to the maximum effort. The lever arm will be positioned&#xD;
      at the distal third of the tested leg (three centimeters proximal to the tibial malleolus).&#xD;
      The execution speeds to be tested for quadriceps and hamstrings will be 75º / s and 240º / s&#xD;
      (4 repetitions), in amplitudes of 100º - 0º, with a resting time of two minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reassessments will be made after one, three and six months of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rehabilitation can be applied to the intervention group in two ways: in person or by home&#xD;
      orientation. The face-to-face form will correspond to 5 weeks of intervention, 3 sessions per&#xD;
      week, which should include: a) aerobic resistance training (performed with a bicycle or&#xD;
      treadmill) of 30 minutes in total (five minutes of warm-up, 20 minutes of aerobic training) ,&#xD;
      five minutes of cooling down); b) strengthening of peripheral muscles using 20-minute&#xD;
      sessions of calisthenic exercises; and c) maintained active stretching (stretching), for 10&#xD;
      minutes, for the main muscle groups. The minimum adherence to the training sessions is 80%&#xD;
      and all sessions will be accompanied by a doctor from the institution for effective first aid&#xD;
      if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The home orientation intervention (telerehabilitation) will correspond to three months of&#xD;
      daily activities, monitored twice a week in the first month and once a week in the second and&#xD;
      third months, by telephone or video conference, and will follow an exercise protocol that&#xD;
      includes: a) aerobic resistance training (walking, cycling, swimming or step exercises) for&#xD;
      15 uninterrupted minutes; b) anaerobic training to strengthen the peripheral muscles&#xD;
      (calisthenic exercises) for 15 minutes at intervals with breathing exercises; and c)&#xD;
      maintained active stretching (stretching), for 10 minutes, for the main muscle groups.&#xD;
