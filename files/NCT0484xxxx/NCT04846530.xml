  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Teosyal RHA® family of products (RHA® 1, RHA® 2, RHA® 3, and RHA® 4) is approved in&#xD;
      Canada for the correction of facial wrinkles and folds. In this study, the approved products&#xD;
      will be placed in small boluses (0.2 mL) intradermally to allow for punch biopsies of the&#xD;
      post-auricular space to be taken. The biopsies will include the injected material and&#xD;
      surrounding skin tissue. Biopsies will be taken immediately after implantation of the product&#xD;
      and at Day 30 and assessed by an independent blinded pathologist.&#xD;
