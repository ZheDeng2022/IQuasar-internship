    <textblock>
      Patients with multiple colorectal liver metastases that progress on 1st line chemotherapy&#xD;
      have a very dismal prognosis, and their options are few. Resections are regularly performed&#xD;
      although this is only supported by anecdotal evidence for this patient group. We want to&#xD;
      assess whether resections actually confer benefit as compared to 2nd line chemotherapy alone,&#xD;
      in a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most frequent malignant disease in Norway (Cancer in&#xD;
      Norway 2017). About 50% of the patients will have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis&#xD;
      or develop metastatic disease later on. Liver metastases are the most frequent presentation&#xD;
      of metastatic disease. Liver resection is considered the only curative treatment option in&#xD;
      CRC patients with liver metastases, however only about 20% of the patients are candidates for&#xD;
      liver resection. The treatment option for the majority of the patients is palliative&#xD;
      chemotherapy with a median overall survival from start of chemotherapy of about 2 years, and&#xD;
      only 10-12 months from starting 2nd line chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While high-quality data (randomized trials) is wanting, it is generally accepted that the&#xD;
      only curative treatment for colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) is surgery. Liver resections&#xD;
      are generally well tolerated and safe 1, but some patients recur early and probably have no&#xD;
      benefit from surgery, or even a net loss of quality-of-life (QoL). These are hard to identify&#xD;
      beforehand, but patients with multiple tumours that progress on 1st line chemotherapy are at&#xD;
      high risk of early recurrence following resection2, 3. These patients are in a grey zone:&#xD;
      their metastases may be technically resectable, but the aggressive biology of their disease&#xD;
      makes overall outcome of surgery highly uncertain. The decision to offer resection to some of&#xD;
      these patients primarily results from want of better alternatives and from lack of&#xD;
      sufficiently precise prognostication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As resections are generally well tolerated and adequate prognostication is wanting, there is&#xD;
      a tendency to offer resections to patients who have borderline resectable CRLM or who exhibit&#xD;
      other non-favourable traits like large or multiple metastases, or progression on 1st line&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Resections followed by early recurrence represent a net loss of quality-of-life&#xD;
      and an unwanted expenditure for society. Exploring the optimal treatment modality for&#xD;
      patients in this grey zone, i.e. with uncertain benefit from surgery, is important to provide&#xD;
      optimal treatment for patients in a critical situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Palliative chemotherapy is in general the only treatment option for the vast majority of&#xD;
      non-resectable patients. The expected median overall survival (OS) from start of first line&#xD;
      chemotherapy is about 2 years and the 5 years OS is about 10%, although longer median OS has&#xD;
      been obtained in selected patients with good performance status (ECOG 0-1), no (K)RAS or BRAF&#xD;
      mutations and left-sided tumours 4-8. The OS from start of second line chemotherapy however&#xD;
      is only 10-12 months 9. This places the prognosis for this group of cancer patients on par&#xD;
      with those having pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial targets a group of patients that are not eligible for the Excalibur 1 and 2 trials&#xD;
      but still have as dismal or even worse prognosis. They will - according to the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria - have a large tumour burden and have shown progression on 1st line systemic&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatment. Based on previous trials, only 30 % of this patient group are&#xD;
      estimated to be alive after two years. These patients have today only one treatment modality&#xD;
      available: 2nd line systemic chemotherapy. Response can, however, only be expected in a small&#xD;
      minority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With such a dismal outcome for these patients, almost any attempt to improve survival would&#xD;
      be warranted and anecdotal evidence shows that some appear to benefit substantially. This&#xD;
      may, however, be a result of biased selection and the benefit of surgery in this grey zone is&#xD;
      unproven.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Multicentre RCT with two parallell arms. One with second line chemotherapy (standard care) and the other with second line chemotherapy + resection. We estimate an overall survival of 12 months in the standard care group. We aim to decide whether resections added to chemotherapy can increase this to 24 months. A two-sided parallel-group test of proportions to answer this with a power of 0.80 and an alpha of 0.15, will require 28 completed patients per group to show superiority for resections. Adding 11 % for a modified intention-to-treat analysis, we aim to randomise a total of 62 patients, i.e. 31 patients per group.</intervention_model_description>
