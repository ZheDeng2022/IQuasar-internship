  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The complexity of COVID-19 suggests a potential need for a range of therapies, including&#xD;
      antiviral agents, immunostimulants, immunosuppressants, adaptogens, and anticoagulants. In&#xD;
      this context, implementation of polyvalency drugs, which exhibit a wide range of biological&#xD;
      activities and multitarget effects that is common for herbal medicines and specifically for&#xD;
      Kan Jang, the fixed combination of Andrographis paniculata (Burm. F.) Wall. ex. Nees and&#xD;
      Eleutherococcus senticosus (Rupr. &amp; Maxim.) Maxim which are known to exhibit antiviral,&#xD;
      immunomodulatory, and anti-inflammatory effects and clinical efficacy in the respiratory&#xD;
      tract of patients with infectious diseases. The purpose of this study is to provide&#xD;
      scientific evidence on the effectiveness of Kan Jang for the treatment of mild COVID-19. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that Kan Jang will have superior efficacy in amelioration COVID symptoms compared&#xD;
      to placebo with a comparable safety profile to placebo. We hypothesize that Kan Jang will&#xD;
      increase patients' recovery rate and decrease the duration of illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to assess the efficacy and tolerability of adjuvant treatment&#xD;
      with Kan Jang for alleviating the severity of inflammatory symptoms (headache, loss of smell,&#xD;
      gustatory dysfunction, rhinorrhea, nasal congestions, cough, sore throat, asthenia, myalgia,&#xD;
      and fever) and shortening of their duration in mild COVID-19 patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rationale. Pathogenesis and progression of COVID-19 is a multistep process, which requires&#xD;
      correct therapeutic strategy on various steps of initiation of overall defense response to&#xD;
      pathogen and its resolution. Consequently, effective treatment of COVID-19 requires&#xD;
      pharmaceutical corrections of many components innate, adaptive immune system, phases I-III&#xD;
      metabolizing enzymes of detoxifying and repairing systems, and the SARS-Cov-2 virus' life&#xD;
      cycle and proliferation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It can be achieved by multitarget pharmaceutical intervention of herbal preparations with&#xD;
      polyvalent and pleiotropic actions on host defense systems, e.g., adaptogens Andrographis&#xD;
      paniculata L. (Burm. F.) Wall. ex. Nees and Eleutherococcus senticosus (Rupr. &amp; Maxim.)&#xD;
      Maxim, known as natural stress-protective plant extracts that increase adaptability,&#xD;
      resilience, and survival of organisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A growing body of evidence suggests that extracts of Andrographis paniculata L. (SHA-10) and&#xD;
      Eleutherococcus senticosus (SHE-3) are effective and well-tolerated medications for&#xD;
      preventing and treating acute viral respiratory infections. WHO recognizes the use of&#xD;
      Andrographis paniculata in the symptomatic treatment of upper respiratory infections,&#xD;
      bronchitis, and pharyngotonsillitis. Recently, Thailand's health ministry approved using an&#xD;
      Herba Andrographidis extract to treat the early stages of Covid-19 as a pilot program amid a&#xD;
      flareup in the coronavirus outbreak in Thailand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fixed combination of these plants' extracts, the herbal medicinal product Kan Jang®, has&#xD;
      been used in Scandinavia for treating symptoms of viral respiratory diseases, such as common&#xD;
      colds and influenza, for &gt;30 years. The clinical evidence accumulated indicates that Kan Jang&#xD;
      has strong and, in many cases, significant effects on various common cold symptoms. In&#xD;
      general, significant improvements were observed in nasal symptoms (e.g., secretion (g/day)&#xD;
      frequency, and congestion, throat symptoms (soreness), respiratory problems (incl. cough,&#xD;
      frequency of cough), headache, general malaise, fatigue, earache, sleep disturbance, and the&#xD;
      objective parameter body temperature and decreased overall total symptoms scores in 5 days of&#xD;
      treatment. Furthermore, Kan Jang® sped up patients' recovery and reduced post-influenza&#xD;
      complications during the influenza viruses A1 and A3 periods in 1999 and 2000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both A. paniculata and E. senticosus and their fixed combination, Kan Jang®, exhibit&#xD;
      antiviral, immunomodulatory, and anti-inflammatory effects. Kan Jang® is significantly more&#xD;
      effective than the two active ingredients A. paniculata, and E. senticosus extracts alone,&#xD;
      presumably due to synergistic interactions in molecular networks deregulated by Kan Jang. A&#xD;
      recent study direct antiviral activity of Andrographis, Eleutherococcus, and their&#xD;
      combination Kan Jang®, against coronavirus, has been demonstrated: Kan Jang significantly&#xD;
      inhibits coronavirus growth in isolated human cells. The antiviral activity of the&#xD;
      combinations of Andrographis and Eleutherococcus is more significant than expected. Further&#xD;
      studies in COVID-19 patients are warranted to verify whether this observation of the direct&#xD;
      antiviral activity of Kan Jang® has clinical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of primary and secondary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment benefits will be evaluated by assessment of clinical outcomes, including&#xD;
      clinician-reported outcome; observer-reported outcome; performance patient-reported outcomes&#xD;
      and biomarkers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment benefits will be evaluated by assessing clinician-, observer- and patient-reported&#xD;
      outcomes, including performance outcomes and biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy primary and secondary endpoints will be obtained by intergroup comparison of&#xD;
      clinical outcomes changes from baseline during the treatment and follow-up (from Day 1 to Day&#xD;
      14 and day 21 after randomization) in Kan Jang control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A description of the statistical methods to be employed, including the timing of any planned&#xD;
      interim analysis (es).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data at each visit will be recorded using a standardized clinician assessment form&#xD;
      and a set of patient rating scales. The data will be entered into an Excel database used as&#xD;
      input to statistical software GraphPad (San Diego, CA, USA) Prism software (version 6.03 for&#xD;
      Windows), which will be the primary software used for data development and analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will involve evaluating the patient's change in scores on the test scale&#xD;
      from the initial visit (baseline) to intermediate and the final visit and at each scheduled&#xD;
      visit of the study. Analysis of changes within treatment groups during the study (Visits&#xD;
      1,2,3 and 4) will be performed by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One-way, repeated measures ANOVA (variables with normal distribution),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Friedman test for repeated several measures (nonparametric data), Results will be&#xD;
           calculated using parametric or non-parametric statistical methods depending on the&#xD;
           nature of data and applied on intention to treat and per-protocol study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will evaluate two main questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Question 1: was randomization successful, and are groups equal at the beginning of the study?&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess whether the treatment groups are similar at baseline, we will compare the mean&#xD;
      values at baseline for subjects who receive Kan Jang vs. placebo by the Student's parametric&#xD;
      independent-measures t-test (variables with normal distribution) or Mann-Whitney&#xD;
      non-parametric test, depending on results of normality test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Question 2: is the effect of Kan Jang treatment superior to the Placebo effect?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of the efficacy of study medications will be achieved by comparison of mean&#xD;
      changes from the baseline (differences before and after treatment of every single patient)&#xD;
      between groups using two-way between-within ANOVA in which an interaction effect indicates a&#xD;
      different response over time between the two groups and would therefore signal a treatment&#xD;
      effect, as well as by multiple comparison t-test (one unpaired test per row),&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is defined as the Duration of the Symptoms. Kaplan-Meier curves will be&#xD;
      generated for all endpoints, and medians will be calculated from those curves. The treatment&#xD;
      arms will be compared by Mantel-Cox log-rank and Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon tests. we will&#xD;
      calculate the estimates of treatment hazard ratios based on log-rank tests and 95% CIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intergroup comparison of the number of patients with particular symptoms will be assessed&#xD;
      using the odds ratio (OR) statistics of endpoints according to Altman; A/B test of&#xD;
      significance of differences of endpoints at 95% confidence, and z-statistic at 95% confidence&#xD;
      of statistical significance (Figure 3 b and Supplement 2)&#xD;
      (https://www.medcalc.org/calc/odds_ratio.php)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect size of the individual and overall symptoms will be calculated as the difference&#xD;
      between the effects of Kan Jang and placebo. We will evaluate an overall relative estimate of&#xD;
      overall effect size (%) between two treatment groups as.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effect size (%) = KJ™ - Placebo / KJ™ X 100&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use a statistical significance level of 5% in the Protocol approved by the health&#xD;
      authorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will perform statistical analysis on an intent-to-treat basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for continuous&#xD;
      variables, and frequencies and percent for categorical variables) will be used to summarize&#xD;
      safety measures, which include adverse experiences, physical examination, vital signs, and&#xD;
      clinical laboratory tests, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of adverse events will be compared across treatment groups for descriptive&#xD;
      purposes and to identify possible differences in the safety profiles using the odds ratio&#xD;
      (OR) statistics of endpoints according to Altman; A/B test of significance of differences of&#xD;
      endpoints at 95% confidence; and z-statistic methods for categorical data&#xD;
