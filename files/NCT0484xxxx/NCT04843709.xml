  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of MRG004A in patients with Tissue Factor positive advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      solid tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of two parts. Part A is a dose escalation study to determine the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of MRG004A. Part B is a disease&#xD;
      specific multi-cohort dose expansion study to further assess the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      MRG004A at confirmed RP2D.&#xD;
