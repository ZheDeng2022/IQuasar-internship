      This is a single arm, pilot multicenter prospective study in up to 22 participants with&#xD;
      relapsing multiple sclerosis. Patients screened for the study can either be scheduled for&#xD;
      vaccine, have received a single vaccine with a scheduled second dose, or already completed&#xD;
      full course (two dose) vaccination. Fully vaccinated participants must be able to complete&#xD;
      immune assay No.1 â‰¥ 14 days after the second dose of vaccine&#xD;
