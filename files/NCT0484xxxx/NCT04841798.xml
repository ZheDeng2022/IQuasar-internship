      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 Problem of Treatment Resistant Depression and a Proposed Solution&#xD;
&#xD;
      Problem of Major Depressive Disorder: Major depressive disorder (MDD) known to the layperson&#xD;
      as clinical depression, is an illness composed of repeated major depressive episodes of&#xD;
      variable length and persistence (MDE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MDD is the leading cause of death and disability in moderate to high income countries 1. MDD&#xD;
      is common with 5% of adults in the midst of a major depressive episode (MDE) and the lifetime&#xD;
      prevalence of MDD is 10 to 20%2. MDD is also often treatment resistant, with 50% of people&#xD;
      having inadequate responses3. Plausible Mechanism of Treatment Resistance: It is generally&#xD;
      believed that there are multiple underlying pathologies in MDD and the mismatch of treatment&#xD;
      to pathology results in treatment resistance. Hence it is important to determine whether&#xD;
      common brain pathologies are targeted by common treatments like serotonin and norepinephrine&#xD;
      reuptake inhibitors, and to establish the degree to which alternative treatments might better&#xD;
      target such brain pathologies. Then with this information matching of treatment to identified&#xD;
      disease pathologies can be optimized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview Rationale for Objectives The abnormal elevation in MAO-B level in MDE of MDD was&#xD;
      most prominent in the prefrontal cortex (see section 1), hence we prioritize this region in&#xD;
      our objectives. As detailed in the introduction, we will assess MAO-B occupancy of&#xD;
      tranylcypromine because it is a MAO-B inhibitor, albeit non-selective, that is approved in&#xD;
      Canada for clinical use to treat MDD. We assess rasagiline as a selective MAO-B inhibitor&#xD;
      that does not require stringent dietary restriction of tyramine at the 1mg dose, which is&#xD;
      approved for Parkinson's Disease in Canada and has potential to be repurposed to treat MDD.&#xD;
      We will also include assessment of MAO-B VT before and after duloxetine to verify the&#xD;
      widespread assumption that the commonly prescribed medications that inhibit the reuptake of&#xD;
      serotonin and norepinephrine, do not affect MAO-B level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To measure MAO-B occupancy of tranylcypromine at a standard treating dose (30 to 60mg&#xD;
           total per day) in the prefrontal cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To measure MAO-B occupancy of rasagiline at 1mg total daily, a dose not requiring&#xD;
           stringent tyramine dietary restriction in the prefrontal cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the effect of duloxetine 60mg daily on MAO-B VT in the prefrontal cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methods to quantitate more exact occupancy inherently require some MAO-B occupancy to&#xD;
      occur, so in the case of objective 3, the related measure of change in MAO-B VT will be&#xD;
      assessed. In addition, we will evaluate MAO-B occupancy of the interventions listed in&#xD;
      objectives 1 and 2 within other brain regions with either reasonably high MAO-B density or&#xD;
      whose dysfunction is implicated in the pathophysiology of MDD, including the anterior&#xD;
      cingulate cortex, ventral striatum, dorsal striatum, thalamus, hippocampus, and midbrain.&#xD;
