      The aim of the present study is to translate the Dizziness Handicap Inventory Scale into&#xD;
      Urdu, Pashto, Punjabi, Sindhi and Balochi languages. Along with validation of the translated&#xD;
      versions by evaluating their validity and reliability in the people of Pakistan, speaking&#xD;
      respective languages and suffering from vertigo and dizziness. No such study has been&#xD;
      previously conducted in the Pakistan region which translates the scale and follows the proper&#xD;
      cross-culture adaptation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dizziness is one of the most common symptoms of many diseases that not only affects the daily&#xD;
      activities of the patient but also negatively alters their jobs and functions. Moreover,&#xD;
      mostly the patients having dizziness due to vestibular causes are known to face more problems&#xD;
      as compared to the others. A precisely valid and reliable tool has been already designed for&#xD;
      the measurement of dizziness while keeping the common complaints of patients in mind. The&#xD;
      dizziness handicap inventory (DHI) was introduced in 1990 by Jacobson and Newman. The&#xD;
      mentioned questionnaire comprises 25 questions that categorize the dizziness effects in three&#xD;
      main areas namely; functional (9 questions, 36 points), emotional (9 questions, 36 points)&#xD;
      and physical (7 questions, 28 points). The maximum score is 100 and the minimum is 0. The&#xD;
      higher the score, the greater handicap is considered. It has high internal consistency. This&#xD;
      tool is widely used in clinical setups to evaluate the condition of the patients and&#xD;
      determine the levels to which their quality of life has been affected by dizziness.&#xD;
      Additionally, it is very easy to be filled and hardly takes 10 minutes at maximum. The DHI is&#xD;
      highly compatible with the international classification of functioning, disability and health&#xD;
      tool, which was standardized by WHO in 2001 for measuring the effects of various diseases.&#xD;
      The aim of DHI is to evaluate the self-perceived handicap effects of dizziness. The target&#xD;
      population are the patients suffering from dizziness due to brain injuries, multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis and vestibular disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 1990, the DHI has been translated into various languages in order to make its&#xD;
      application better. Some examples of the translated languages include Arabic, Brazilian,&#xD;
      Spanish, Chinese, Italian, Dutch, French, Norwegian, and German. All of these translated&#xD;
      versions have been proved to be very useful, with high validity, reliability and internal&#xD;
      consistency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, The DHI is considered the most beneficial questionnaire for the evaluation of dizziness&#xD;
      and unsteadiness, especially related to vestibular rehabilitation. However, this&#xD;
      questionnaire does not have any versions that can be utilized in Pakistan such as Urdu,&#xD;
      Pushto, Punjabi, Sindhi and Balochi. The purpose of this study is to translate the DHI into&#xD;
      Urdu, Pushto, Punjabi, Sindhi and Balochi languages and then evaluating the validity and&#xD;
      reliability of these versions in order to make this questionnaire available for research and&#xD;
      clinics for the population of Pakistan.&#xD;

    <description>The Dizziness Handicap Inventory Scale is a first-hand measure of disability for patients with vertigo and dizziness. The mentioned questionnaire comprises 25 questions that categorize the dizziness effects in three main areas namely; functional (9 questions, 36 points), emotional (9 questions, 36 points) and physical (7 questions, 28 points). The maximum score is 100 and the minimum is 0. The higher the score, the greater handicap is considered. It distinguishes itself from other published scales as it has an approach that deals with the concepts of disability and its assessment. Its translation is to be done in the local languages of Pakistan through a rigorous and approved process.</description>

    <description>To determine the reliability of cross-culturally adapted and the translated Dizziness Handicap Inventory versions in patients with vertigo and dizziness of respective languages۔ Reliability or reproducibility refers to the ability of a measure to produce the same results when administered at two or more interval between different visits of the patient. Thus this will be measured through test re-test reliability.</description>
