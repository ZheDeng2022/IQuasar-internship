      Background: It is increasingly recognized that late preterm infants have increased&#xD;
      respiratory morbidity in the neonatal period as well as decreased lung function in later&#xD;
      life. Also, in-utero growth retardation (IUGR) and low birth weight are associated with&#xD;
      increased respiratory morbidity beginning from infancy, throughout childhood and into&#xD;
      adulthood. However, very few studies have assessed long term respiratory consequences of late&#xD;
      preterm birth in comparison with IUGR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To determine respiratory morbidity of late-preterm vs infants with IUGR at school age&#xD;
      Study Design: Participants included late-preterm AGA infants (34-36, 6/7 weeks), IUGR infants&#xD;
      (term/preterm) and term AGA infants born between 2004 and 2008 were included in this study&#xD;
      and assessed for respiratory morbidity at school age. To assess the impact of late-preterm&#xD;
      birth compared with IUGR and term gestation on respiratory morbidity by using a validated&#xD;
      questionnaire. Wheezing, infectious respiratory morbidity and physician-diagnosed asthma&#xD;
      panels were evaluated.&#xD;

      Our study is a cross-sectional study in which the school-age respiratory morbidity of&#xD;
      newborns with late preterm and IUGR birth history who were followed and treated by Trakya&#xD;
      University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatology between&#xD;
      January 2006 and December 2008 were evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total number of 160 children were included in the study. Children who admitted to the&#xD;
      Neonatal intensive care unit and/or those who were born at the obstetrics unit and followed&#xD;
      up with their mothers between January 2006 - December 2008 and reevaluated at school age (5-7&#xD;
      years old) during the study, were divided into two main groups: Late preterm AGA infants:&#xD;
      according to the new BALLARD scoring system (5) gestational age was 34-36 6/7 and those who&#xD;
      were at the 10-90th percentile according to the Fenton growth curves (6) (Group 1). Newborns&#xD;
      with IUGR: term or preterm infants below 10th percentile according to the values calculated&#xD;
      according to Fenton growth curves (6) (Group 2). In addition to these groups, preterm IUGR&#xD;
      infants (&lt;32 weeks of gestation) (Group 2a), and an equal number of preterm AGA infants (&lt;32&#xD;
      weeks of gestation) (Group 3), late preterm (between 34-36 6/7 gestational weeks) IUGR&#xD;
      infants (Group 2b) were divided into subgroups. And, the healthy term (gestation week 38-42&#xD;
      weeks), AGA newborns, who born between January 2006 and December 2008, were included in the&#xD;
      study as a control group (Group 4) (Figure 1). The presence of major anomalies, patients who&#xD;
      did not come to the school-age assessment or and rejected the informed consent form were&#xD;
      excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early (perinatal-neonatal), natal and postnatal period data were recorded from the hospital&#xD;
      database system and patient file. The morbidities observed during the follow-up of the&#xD;
      newborns, the duration of hospitalization, needed of oxygen, surfactant administration,&#xD;
      positive pressure ventilation requirement, and need for mechanical ventilation support and&#xD;
      duration were noted from patient file records. During the study, the study and control group&#xD;
      cases who were at school age and had perinatal parameters as defined above were contacted by&#xD;
      phone and invited to the outpatient clinic. Anthropometric measurements of all patients were&#xD;
      taken (TartÄ±msan brand, TBS model, scale with serial number 1212430 and height meter).&#xD;
      Demographic information, socioeconomic level, mother/father education level, mother's smoking&#xD;
      status and medical history were questioned, and physical examinations of the patients were&#xD;
      performed. The validated Turkish forms of ATS-DLD-78-C (7) and ISAAC questionnaires (8) were&#xD;
      tested on 10 randomly selected patients by 2 different investigators to evaluate their&#xD;
      intelligibility for screening respiratory diseases. The questionnaires were applied&#xD;
      separately to both mother and father and after comparing the answers, it was decided that the&#xD;
      questions were understandable. After the physical examination, the questionnaire forms were&#xD;
      filled in face-to-face by the research doctor who did not know the patients' medical history&#xD;
      (M.C.U).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Responses to the survey questions include; the presence of wheezing/wheezing in the chest&#xD;
      independent of having a cold, presence of wheezing in the chest day/night, presence of two or&#xD;
      more wheezing episodes causing shortness of breath, the need of using medication during&#xD;
      wheezing attacks causing shortness of breath, one or more of the presence of wheezing&#xD;
      episodes after exercise or playing games &quot;Respiratory morbidity 1 included wheezing panel&quot;,&#xD;
      presence of hospitalization due to severe respiratory infection under 2 years of age, having&#xD;
      had more than 1 previous bronchiolitis/bronchitis/pneumonia or two or three of them, more&#xD;
      than 3 days in the last 3 years of chest disease, cough/sputum attacks lasting at least for a&#xD;
      week or longer, sputum, breast fullness, cough present for more than 3 months of the year&#xD;
      &quot;Respiratory morbidity 2 included previous infectious respiratory morbidity panel&quot;, presence&#xD;
      of physician -diagnosed asthma history, current asthma, and the presence of a history of&#xD;
      being followed up with a diagnosis of asthma &quot;Respiratory morbidity 3 physician -diagnosed&#xD;
      asthma panel&quot; (9-13).&#xD;
