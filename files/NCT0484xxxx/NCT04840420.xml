  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is an effectiveness-implementation hybrid study with two aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) to determine the utility of a WBC (Well Being Coordinator)-driven Social Prescribing model&#xD;
      in the intermediate care setting;&#xD;
&#xD;
      and 2) to assess the patient health outcomes associated with the implementation pilot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implementation research questions include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Practical fit: Does the intervention fit with the daily life activities of study&#xD;
           participants? What is the level of safety and burdensomeness of the frequency, intensity&#xD;
           and duration of the intervention?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Acceptability: What are the acceptance, retention and follow-up rates as the&#xD;
           participants move through the intervention? What are the reasons for retention?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Adoption: How well do the WBC carry out the assessment and intervention as planned?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key hypotheses include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participants in the intervention group will incur a higher improvement in perceived&#xD;
           general wellbeing and social support than those participants in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants in the intervention group will incur less healthcare utilisation than those&#xD;
           in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Improvement in the perceived general wellbeing and social support will be moderated by&#xD;
           the level of social support of participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will adopt a sequential mixed-methods design combining:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) An open-label RCT to evaluate the effects of Social Prescribing on participants' general&#xD;
      wellbeing, social support and healthcare utilisation. This open-label design approach is&#xD;
      chosen in view of the challenge to blind the participants, investigators, and all peripheral&#xD;
      staff to the treatment allocation in a practical clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential patients will be recruited from 3 community hospitals (namely Bright Vision&#xD;
      Hospital, Sengkang Community Hospital and Outram Community Hospital)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation Patients will be randomised to either the intervention or control group. An&#xD;
      independent administrator in a central office will generate the entire randomisation sequence&#xD;
      using GraphPad randomisation sequence software© 2017 before recruitment commenced. This data&#xD;
      will be password protected and only accessible by the administrator. The individual&#xD;
      allocation will be revealed to each patient, their ward doctor/clinician, the deprescribing&#xD;
      and study teams just before the first deprescribing round, hereby ensuring allocation&#xD;
      concealment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key intervention elements will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Upon enrolment, WBCs co-develop a personalised social prescription plan with the&#xD;
           participant based on Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) using SBAR4;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  WBCs refer the participant to inpatient activities that suit the participant's interests&#xD;
           and preferences; and · WBCs work with a local anchor support network, Community Network&#xD;
           for Seniors (CNS), to link the participant to community assets based on the social&#xD;
           prescription plan co-developed. This will take place from seven days prior to patient&#xD;
           discharge to about 2-month post-discharge. WBCs will stop following up with the&#xD;
           participant in community once CNS has successfully taken over the case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use a SBAR4 tool, an evolved version of the well-known SBAR framework, to&#xD;
      facilitate the assessment. This tool was previously developed by the Principal Investigator&#xD;
      and his research team for caring for patients with complex comorbidities and has been widely&#xD;
      adopted both locally and internationally. The R4 components - Recommendation (i.e. an action&#xD;
      plan for each SDOH of the patient), Resources (i.e. social and medical resources are mustered&#xD;
      to support the patient), Responsibilities (i.e. role of the patient, stakeholders and care&#xD;
      providers, and how they can be activated), and Relationships (i.e. connections with patient,&#xD;
      caregivers, team members and service providers, are sustained to facilitate addressing SDOH)&#xD;
      will also guide the WBC to co-develop the Social Prescribing plan with the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will receive usual care.(including educational pamphlets informing about&#xD;
      community resources and to improve wellbeing)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to recruit 804 participants in total (402 in each group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inpatient The WBCs will conduct the first visit to the newly admitted patients within 3 days&#xD;
      of patients' admission to screen patients' eligibility for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the intervention group, the WBCs will conduct approximately daily visits to the&#xD;
      participants for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. collecting demographics and baseline data as described in F10;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. co-developing the personalised social prescription plan with the participant based on&#xD;
           Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) using SBAR4;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. referring and accompanying the participant to attend inpatient activities that suit the&#xD;
           participant's interests and preferences; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. informing and seeking the participant's agreement with community assets identified for&#xD;
           the participant together with CNS. The duration of each visit will vary ranging from 15&#xD;
           minutes to 1 hour, depending on the comfort level of the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the control group, the interviewer will conduct approximately 2 visits to collect&#xD;
      demographics and baseline data. The duration of each visit will range from 15 to 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community phase For the intervention group, approximately at 1-week post-discharge, the WBCs&#xD;
      will telephone the participant to check his/her transition back to community and readiness to&#xD;
      start attending community activities or receiving services, as per the social prescription&#xD;
      plan developed during the participant's inpatient stay. For community activities, upon&#xD;
      receiving positive responses from the participant, the WBCs and CNS will visit the&#xD;
      participant, accompanying him/her to the activity premise on the first day of the activity&#xD;
      session and send the participant home after the session. The activity session will normally&#xD;
      take about 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the control group, no intervention will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 2 months after the discharge, the interviewers will telephone the participants&#xD;
      to schedule a telephone or face-to-face session for the post-discharge data collection,&#xD;
      depending on the participants' preference. At the agreed timing, the interviewers will&#xD;
      telephone or meet the participant and proceed with the quantitative survey, similar to the&#xD;
      baseline data collection. The duration will be approximately 30 mins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the participants selected for the qualitative interview, the interviewers will also&#xD;
      arrange a telephone or face-to-face interview session, depending on the participants'&#xD;
      preference. At the agreed timing, the interviewers will telephone or meet the participant and&#xD;
      conduct the semi-structured interview. The duration will be approximately 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection The participants' general well-being will be measured by the Brief Inventory&#xD;
      of Thriving (BIT), a 10-item self-administered instrument consisting of 5 psychological&#xD;
      well-being constructs in positive psychology: Positive emotions, Engagement, Relationship,&#xD;
      Meaning and Accomplishment (PERMA), which establishes the theoretical basis of Social&#xD;
      Prescribing under study. Though this tool has not been validated in a Singapore context, it&#xD;
      is the only tool that the study team has found in literature that centres around PERMA and&#xD;
      feasible to administer in a practical clinical setting. The participants' social support will&#xD;
      be measured by the modified Medical Outcomes Study- Social Support Survey (mMOS-SS), an&#xD;
      8-item self-administered instrument covering 2 domains: emotional/informational support and&#xD;
      tangible/instrumental support. The modified version is chosen over the full 19-item version&#xD;
      because of its relevance and easiness of administration. Baseline data of the intervention&#xD;
      group at enrollment of the study will be collected by the WBCs, as the information likely&#xD;
      help the WBCs to formulate the social prescription plan. Baseline data of the control group&#xD;
      and the 2-month (approximately) post-discharge data of the intervention and control groups&#xD;
      will be collected by interviewers. 2 months have been set based on a previous prototype of&#xD;
      Social Prescribing implemented in Bright Vision Hospital. It was found that patients&#xD;
      generally took about 1 month to transit back home after discharge from the hospital and start&#xD;
      attending community activities or receiving intervention sessions from the second month. Both&#xD;
      instruments have been tested in wards to ensure that the WBCs and interviewers understand the&#xD;
      questions correctly and explain to patients in a similar manner. The participants' health&#xD;
      utilisation will include the polyclinic visit, emergency department visit,Specialist&#xD;
      Outpatient Clinic (SOC) visit, unplanned admission and average length of stay. The 12-month&#xD;
      pre-enrollment and 12-month post-enrollment utilisation data will be extracted from the&#xD;
      national public healthcare administrative database (i.e. Omnibus). In addition, participants'&#xD;
      functional status (measured by the Modified Barthel Index) and cognitive status (measured by&#xD;
      the Abbreviated Mental Test) will be extracted from the SCH Management System. The period for&#xD;
      extraction will be from the participants' admission to discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) Qualitative semi-structured interviews to understand the experience of participants (in&#xD;
      the intervention group) with the WBCs and Social Prescribing. Following the quantitative&#xD;
      survey, purposive sampling will be used, targeting 30 participants including 15 active&#xD;
      service users (i.e. patients who have been attending the activities/intervention sessions as&#xD;
      per the social prescription plan) and 15 inactive service users, based on the manpower&#xD;
      resources available. Semi-structured interviews will be completed through telephone or&#xD;
      face-to-face modes after the participants have attended the first activity session in&#xD;
      community or received the first service session from community partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the quantitative and qualitative data will also be used to assess the feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability and adoption of the WBC-driven model. No other retrospective data will be used&#xD;
      for this proposed research except the 12-month pre-enrollment healthcare utilisation.&#xD;
