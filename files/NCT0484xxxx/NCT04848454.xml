  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The achievement of pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT)&#xD;
      is associated with improved outcome across all breast cancer (BC) subtypes. Anthracycline and&#xD;
      taxanes based chemotherapy is usually the first choice of NACT for human epidermal growth&#xD;
      factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative breast cancer, but there is no ideal second-line therapy&#xD;
      for those with unsatisfactory effect after first-line NACT. Vinorelbine combined with&#xD;
      cisplatin may be a choice for patients after failure or progression with anthracycline and/or&#xD;
      taxanes. Immunotherapy has achieved good efficacy in many malignant tumors. Chemotherapy may&#xD;
      have a certain immune activation effect, thus combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy&#xD;
      has significant clinical value in neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment of breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So we designed this one center single arm phase 2 clinical trial to test the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of camrelizumab (PD-1 inhibitor) combined with vinorelbine and cisplatin as a&#xD;
      second-line therapy for HER2 negative breast cancer patients who did not achieve significant&#xD;
      effect after 2 cycle treatments of anthracycline plus taxanes NACT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target population of our study are early-stage HER2 negative breast cancer patients with&#xD;
      indications of NACT who did not receive partial response after 2 cycle of standard&#xD;
      anthracycline and taxanes treaments according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. The enrolled patients&#xD;
      will receive 6 cycles of camrelizumab combined with vinorelbine and cisplatin as second-line&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy. Then they need to undergo surgery. The subjects have to continue&#xD;
      camrelizumab until it is totally used for 1 year (about 17 cycles in all). The patients will&#xD;
      routinely receive conventional adjuvant therapy and enter the long-term follow-up to get&#xD;
      their survival infoumation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      It has been proved that the achievement of pathological complete response (pCR) after&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is associated with improved outcome across all breast cancer&#xD;
      (BC) subtypes. At present, anthracycline and taxanes based chemotherapy is usually the first&#xD;
      choice of neoadjuvant therapy for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative&#xD;
      breast cancer, and the response rate can be more than 2/3. However, there are still some&#xD;
      patients not getting satisfactory outcome using this regimen, for whom there is no unified&#xD;
      ideal second-line neoadjuvant therapy to choose. Studies on metastatic BC have shown that&#xD;
      vinorelbine combined with cisplatin has good efficacy and safety in the treatment of patients&#xD;
      after failure or progression with anthracycline and/or taxanes. In other studies, patients&#xD;
      with poor response to anthracycline and taxanes based NACT changed to NACT containing&#xD;
      vinorelbine could obtain improved long-term survival. These results suggest that adjusting&#xD;
      the neoadjuvant therapy according to the efficacy may bring more benefits to patients and&#xD;
      vinorelbine combined with cisplatin is one of the second-line options for HER2 negative&#xD;
      breast cancer who has been treated by the anthracycline and taxanes based NACT but not&#xD;
      getting good efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunotherapy has achieved good efficacy in many malignant tumors. The US Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) has approved the indications for the use of pembrolizumab ( an anti-PD-1&#xD;
      antibody) and atezolizumab (an anti -PD-L1 antibody) in patients with unresectable locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic triple negative breast cancer. In neoadjuvant therapy, many studies&#xD;
      have shown that the increase of pCR rate after NACT combined with immunotherapy, and the&#xD;
      clinical benefit is obvious in the early stage. This was hypothesized that chemotherapy&#xD;
      including anthracyclines or other drugs may have a certain immune activation effect, thus&#xD;
      combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy has significant clinical value in neoadjuvant&#xD;
      and adjuvant treatment of breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above background, we propose the hypothesis that camrelizumab combined with&#xD;
      vinorelbine and cisplatin can be recommended for HER2 negative breast cancer patients who did&#xD;
      not achieve significant efficacy after 2 cycle treatments of anthracycline plus taxanes as&#xD;
      first-line neoadjuvant therapy. In order to confirm this hypothesis, we designed the&#xD;
      following one centre single arm phase 2 clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We defined the target population of our study as those early-stage HER2 negative breast&#xD;
      cancer (triple negative breast cancer and HER2 negative hormone receptor positive breast&#xD;
      cancer) patients with indications of NACT who did not receive partial response after 2 cycle&#xD;
      of standard anthracycline and taxanes treaments according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. We expect&#xD;
      to recruit 30 subjects. The enrolled patients will receive 6 cycles of neoadjuvant therapy of&#xD;
      camrelizumab combined with vinorelbine and cisplatin (NP) as second-line neoadjuvant therapy.&#xD;
      After the patients complete the neoadjuvant therapy or stop treatment due to disease&#xD;
      progression, intolerance of adverse reactions or other conditions that the researchers&#xD;
      thought they could not continue to benefit from the treatment, they need to undergo surgery&#xD;
      in 4 weeks. The subjects have to continue camrelizumab every 3 weeks like during the&#xD;
      preoperative phase until it is totally used for 1 year (about 17 cycles in all). In addition,&#xD;
      the patients will routinely receive conventional treatment, endocrine therapy and other&#xD;
      adjuvant therapy. Our primary objection is to evaluate the efficacy of second-line&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy with camrelizumab combined with NP; and the secondary objection is to&#xD;
      verify this regimen's security. The efficacy of camrelizumab and NP neoadjuvant therapy will&#xD;
      be evaluated according to the assessment during treatment, postoperative pathological results&#xD;
      and follow-up results. We will record the clinical response, pCR, progression-free survival&#xD;
      and overall survival etc. Safety information will be collected continuously at the beginning&#xD;
      of study treatment until the completion of follow-up after study treatment. Besides, we will&#xD;
      do some exploratory research using the histological or blood samples of the subjects about&#xD;
      biomarkers (like tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, expression of PD-L1 etc.) that may be used&#xD;
      for clinical prediction, selection of suitable population and other situations.&#xD;
