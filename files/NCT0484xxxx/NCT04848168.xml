  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PRISMIII(Pediatric Risk of Mortality III), PIM2(Pediatric Index of Mortality 2) and&#xD;
      PELOD(Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction) are frequently used for predicting mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity in general pediatric ICUs(Intensive Care Units). However, the effectiveness of&#xD;
      these scoring sistems in a specific group patients undergoing congenital heart surgery(CHS)&#xD;
      is unknown. In this study, the investigators aimed primarily to evaluate the success of these&#xD;
      scoring systems in predicting mortality and morbiditiy in this specific group and to compare&#xD;
      the scoring systems with eachother, and secondly to evaluate the relationship of these&#xD;
      systems with the STAT(STS-EACTS CHS Mortality Score) category&#xD;

    <description>Patients younger than 18 years of age who had undergone congenital heart surgery were evaluated on the first postoperative day in the ICU and parameters were recorded. PRISMIII and PELOD scores were calculated using the most abnormal values in the first 24 hours, and PIM2 score was calculated using the data within the first hour.</description>
