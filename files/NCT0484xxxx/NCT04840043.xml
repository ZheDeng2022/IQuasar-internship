  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression appears to be resistant to the available pharmacological treatments. Autonomic&#xD;
      responses accompanied by any psychological stress are sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and&#xD;
      neuroendocrine responses are formed by hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is; assessment of effectiveness of osteopathic approach on sympathetic nervous&#xD;
      system and HPA axis in adolescents with depression.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Depression diagnosed and volunteer to participate 39 cases who between the ages of 15-21&#xD;
      included. All participants were recruited and randomly assigned into two groups, the&#xD;
      osteopathy group (OG) and the placebo group (PG). Stimulation on the sympathetic truncus and&#xD;
      prevertebral ganglia were performed in the OG group. The stimulation of the PG group was&#xD;
      performed with a lighter touch and a shorter duration in similar areas. Each participant was&#xD;
      filled in the demographic data form, Beck Depression Scale and State and Trait Anxiety&#xD;
      Inventory (STAI Form - 1 and Form - 2) before the application. Emotional state visual analog&#xD;
      scale and STAI Form - 1 was filled and blood pressure and pulse measurement were made and&#xD;
      saliva sample was taken before application, immediately after application and 20 minutes&#xD;
      after application.&#xD;
