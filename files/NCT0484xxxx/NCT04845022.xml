  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to find the overall incidence of thrombotic microangiopathy in&#xD;
      snakebite victims. As we know snakebite is a common in tropical regions. Many a times the&#xD;
      early diagnosis of TMA is missed and precious time which could have helped in improving the&#xD;
      patient prognosis is lost. Also via this study we wish to learn the role of cost effective&#xD;
      test like peripheral smear which could help learn morphological picture of red blood cells&#xD;
      and thus help in early prediction of patients clinical prognosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All snakebite patients brought to emergency department with history of bite and prolonged&#xD;
      whole blood clotting time (WBCT) will be included in the study . their samples for hemogram,&#xD;
      RFT and LDH would be collected in corresponding tubes . from sample for hemogram a peripheral&#xD;
      blood smear (PBS) would be prepared , also the sample would be checked for direct coomb's&#xD;
      test (DCT) positivity. DCT positive patients would be excluded from study . Also patients who&#xD;
      received blood or blood components from outside hospital or patients with known history of&#xD;
      hemolytic disease or patients on anti platelets or anticoagulants would also be excluded from&#xD;
      this study .&#xD;
&#xD;
      thus patients who meet the exclusion and inclusion criteria would be followed up after 48&#xD;
      hours and their hemogram , RFT and LDH would be re assessed to check for presence of&#xD;
      hemolysis , thrombocytopenia and acute kidney injury(AKI) .From the hemogram sample PBS would&#xD;
      be prepared to check for presence of schistocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here we aim to study for incidence of TMA - defined as presence of MAHA( microangiopathic&#xD;
      hemolytic anemia ) , thrombocytopenia and presence of AKI . MAHA is detected as drop of hb,&#xD;
      presence of schistocytes in PBS , increase in LDH and increase in retic count. India is a&#xD;
      tropical country and the southern state of Kerala , this study is done with the purpose of&#xD;
      finding the prevalence of TMA among patients of snakebite brought to a tertiary care centre.&#xD;
      Most often the victims are farmers or people from middle class. A cost effective test such as&#xD;
      peripheral smear can help in predicting the prognosis and thereby aid in deciding whether the&#xD;
      patient should require a multi disciplinary treatment early on and thereby play a pivotal&#xD;
      role in saving patient life as well as provide an economical solution.&#xD;
