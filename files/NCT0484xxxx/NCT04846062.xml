      Hypotheses of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mothers/ caregivers who have less knowledge and attitude about the prevention of IDD&#xD;
           their table salt obtained from in the households has less quantity of iodide than those&#xD;
           mothers/ caregivers who might have knowledge and attitude.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mothers/ caregivers with poor knowledge and attitude in iodized salt utilization&#xD;
           circumstances that their index children have at higher risk of iodine deficiency&#xD;
           compared with their properly utilizes counterparts. linear&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Children's poor dietary intake has low hemoglobin concentration compared to their peers&#xD;
           who used diversified dietary intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Children with a low concentration of iodine have stunted growth (linear growth) compared&#xD;
           with their high iodine concentration peers at the end of the follow-up period of fifteen&#xD;
           months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Children with a low concentration of hemoglobin have stunted growth (linear growth)&#xD;
           compared with their high hemoglobin concentration peers at the end of the follow-up&#xD;
           fifteen months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Higher concentrations of micronutrients due affect the growth of children compared with&#xD;
           their higher concentration of micronutrients at the end of the follow-up period of&#xD;
           fifteen months.&#xD;

      Objective: The aim of this study is to determine effect of BCC on micronutrients intake and&#xD;
      growth of children age 6-59 month old in Arsi Zone highland, Oromiya, Ethiopia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chapter 1 knowledge and attitude about the prevention of iodine deficiency disorders among&#xD;
      women and quantification of iodine found in table salt. This chapter presents the&#xD;
      investigation of iodine content in table salts samples obtained from households and&#xD;
      headquarters markets and the women's understanding and approach status about iodine&#xD;
      deficiency disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chapter 2 Median urinary iodine concentration and associated factors among children age 6 to&#xD;
      59 months; It summarizes the median level of iodide found in children's urine and determined&#xD;
      significant associated factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chapter 3 hemoglobin level and associated factors among children age 6 to 59 months. It&#xD;
      describes predictors of knowledge and attitude about the prevention of iron deficiency anemia&#xD;
      among women and it presents the hemoglobin threshold of children and determines factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chapter 4 effect of NBC on iodised salt utilization and median urine iodine concentration&#xD;
      among the growth of children. This chapter describes the impact of NBC intervention on&#xD;
      iodised salt utilization in the HH, compaction of the endine - baseline difference of median&#xD;
      urine concentration, and its significant association with the growth of children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chapter 5 effect of NBC on prevent anemia and hemoglobin concentration among the growth of&#xD;
      children. This chapter describes the impact of NBC on iron-rich dietary intake in the HH.&#xD;
      Also, the chapter described the comparition of endine - baseline mean differences of&#xD;
      hemoglobin concentration, and factors associated with the growth of children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chapter 6 micronutrient concentration effects on growth defect among children; this chapter&#xD;
      describes the deference endline - baseline difference of the mean differences in iron and&#xD;
      iodine and concentration association with linear growth of children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Community based, clustered randomized controlled trial will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study sample size: The sample size was determined using Gpower 3.0 software assuming a power&#xD;
      of 95%, precision of 5%, and an effect size of 0.25 giving 834. Additionally, we considered&#xD;
      the loss of study participants due to an increase in age of children above 59 months for the&#xD;
      given intervention period was 11% =95. Where the design effect had 10% =83 and a final the&#xD;
      estimated sample size was 1012.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multistage sampling method was applied to select 16 kebeles [lower administration Units]&#xD;
      randomly and equally assigned into intervention and control clusters using computer ENA 2011&#xD;
      version software. Further, systematic random sampling will be used to select&#xD;
      mothers/caregivers with their children from randomly assigned kebeles Baseline data will be&#xD;
      collected from recruited mothers and from their pair children. Questionnaire on behaviours on&#xD;
      dietary intake of children and micronutrients utilization, and anthropometric data will be&#xD;
      collected; Households' table salt samples will be collected and analyzed with a titration&#xD;
      biomarker in Ethiopian Public health institute food and nutrition laboratory (EPI). Urine&#xD;
      samples for baseline will be collected and transported to EPI and analyzed to determine urine&#xD;
      iodine Concentration (UIC) and this will be applicable at the end line of nutrition behavior&#xD;
      change intervention. Blood samples will be collected to determine hemoglobin level before&#xD;
      after nutrition behavior change intervention implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data processing and analysis: Anthropometric and other data were entered into EpiData 3.0&#xD;
      version software and transferred and analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social&#xD;
      Science statistical software for Windows, version 21, Anthropometric data will be exported to&#xD;
      Emergency Nutrition Assessment [ENA] software to generate height for age Z-score (HAZ) and&#xD;
      weight for height z-score [WHZ]. HAZ ≥ -2 Z-score will be categorized as normal growth status&#xD;
      and HFA &lt; -2 z-score will be indicated as a growth defect. According to WHO classification, &gt;&#xD;
      40% is very high and 30 to 39% is high and 20 to 29 medium and &lt; 20% is low (22). Also,&#xD;
      weight for height Z score (WHZ) was generated to determine wasting among children (16, 17).&#xD;
      Anthropometric results of children's growth at baseline and end-line surveys were compared&#xD;
      with the WHO 2005 growth standard using ENA software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Linear regression was used to determine the effect of iron and iodine concentration on the&#xD;
      linear growth of children. Independent sample t test will be used to determine mean&#xD;
      differences between end-line-baseline in micronutrient concentrations (iodine and iron) and&#xD;
      will be compared between intervention and control groups and significance will be determined&#xD;
      with Standard Error (P&lt;0.05) . Finally, independent variables that will have P &lt;0.25 in&#xD;
      samples t-test will be transferred to Generalized Estimating Equations [GEE] for further&#xD;
      analysis and the results presented using Beta coefficients (β) and 95% confidence intervals.&#xD;
