  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancers of the upper gastro-intestinal tract, including esophagus (gullet), stomach and small&#xD;
      bowel, are amongst the deadliest malignancies. The main reason for their high mortality rate&#xD;
      is that they are usually diagnosed late when curative treatments are no longer effective.&#xD;
      However, these types of cancer generally arise from well-described pre-cancerous diseases,&#xD;
      such as Barrett's esophagus and gastric intestinal metaplasia. This provides an opportunity&#xD;
      for clinicians to detect these pre-cancerous conditions early and offer adequate cure or&#xD;
      clinical monitoring before they progress to cancer. A camera test (gastroscopy) is the&#xD;
      gold-standard test to detect pre-cancerous diseases in these organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been limited research to set the standards for performance of a gastroscopy,&#xD;
      especially with regards to diagnosis of pre-cancerous conditions, which require knowledge and&#xD;
      skills by the physician performing the test (endoscopist). Therefore, the hypothesis behind&#xD;
      this study is that the aforementioned pre-cancerous diseases are understudied and often go&#xD;
      undetected. This study aims to understand how often endoscopists should diagnose these&#xD;
      pre-cancerous diseases on routine gastroscopy and help define the standards to measure&#xD;
      performance. The investigators will assess the following rates: i. how often endoscopists&#xD;
      diagnose these pre-cancerous lesions during endoscopy; ii. How often these conditions are&#xD;
      diagnosed on biopsies taken according to a standardized protocol; iii. How often these&#xD;
      condition should have been diagnosed by the endoscopists based on the review of pictures by&#xD;
      expert endoscopists. The investigators will also compare the rates of correct diagnosis by&#xD;
      endoscopists with different levels of experience and based on the times spent to complete the&#xD;
      diagnostic test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigating these aspects will enhance the understanding of the medical community with&#xD;
      regards to the diagnosis of these pre-cancerous lesions and set endoscopy standards to&#xD;
      improve their early detection and treatment before they progress to cancer. This will&#xD;
      translate to improved cancer prevention and benefit for patients.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is the gold-standard test for investigating upper&#xD;
      gastrointestinal (GI) tract pathology. The learning curve for EGD is generally steep and it&#xD;
      is often performed by trainees at the mid stages of core training as well as nurse&#xD;
      endoscopists. Currently the Joint Advisory Group for GI endoscopy (JAG) recommends a minimum&#xD;
      number of 200 procedures to acquire the skills and perform endoscopy independently. However,&#xD;
      there has been very little research done to set the standard required to measure EGD&#xD;
      performance. The only validated quality indicators in EGD include the successful J-manoeuvre&#xD;
      rate and D2 intubation rate, which reflect very basic skills and do not measure diagnostic&#xD;
      ability. This contrasts with key performance indicators (KPI) for colonoscopy, for which&#xD;
      extensive research has led to development of formal quality performance indicators. In&#xD;
      colonoscopy formal quality indicators include (i) cecal intubation rate, (ii) adenoma&#xD;
      detection rate, (iii) rectal retroversion rate, (iv) colonoscopy withdrawal time, (v) polyp&#xD;
      retrieval rate, (vi) post-colonoscopy colorectal cancer rate and (vii) perforation rate. This&#xD;
      has allowed researchers to demonstrate that poor quality colonoscopy leads to an increase in&#xD;
      the incidence of interval cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar benchmarks have not been set for the upper GI tract. A recent UK study revealed that&#xD;
      7.7% cases of upper GI cancers were missed on previous EGD and that there was a correlation&#xD;
      between missed cancer and high number of procedures per lists and hence, arguably, those&#xD;
      performed under user time pressure. This is in line with studies on other Western populations&#xD;
      indicating that between 5.3% and 13.9% of patients with upper GI cancers have had normal EGD&#xD;
      reported within the previous 3 years. Given that gastroscopy is the most commonly performed&#xD;
      procedure in endoscopy units in the UK and its demand is increasing, there is an urge to&#xD;
      identify diagnostic KPI to measure diagnostic skills, to improve quality of the endoscopies&#xD;
      and to reduce the rate of missed diagnoses. Furthermore, such minimum quality standards are&#xD;
      extremely important to counteract the potential negative effects on the performance of the&#xD;
      pressure faced by endoscopy departments to deliver diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in a&#xD;
      timely fashion. The importance of adequate procedure time for diagnostic accuracy has been&#xD;
      demonstrated both in the detection of oesophageal and gastric neoplastic lesions. For&#xD;
      detection of upper GI neoplasia, it has been demonstrated that a minimum of 7 minutes per&#xD;
      procedure should be spent in order to ensure adequate visualisation and allow detection of&#xD;
      high-risk lesion . In a Korean study, that compared faster with slower endoscopists, all of&#xD;
      whom had adequate training and experience, the slower endoscopists (withdrawal time from&#xD;
      duodenum &gt;3min) had a significantly higher detection rate of upper GI neoplasia. Finally, in&#xD;
      the context of Barrett's oesophagus (BO), longer inspection times during EGD correlated with&#xD;
      increase detection rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-malignant lesions in the upper GI tract are generally understudied when compared to those&#xD;
      in the lower GI tract. Furthermore, their epidemiology seems to vary with geography, and this&#xD;
      has not been inadequately investigated in the UK. Barrett's esophagus (BE) is the only known&#xD;
      precursor to esophageal adenocarcinoma. The population prevalence is difficult to estimate&#xD;
      given that the condition can be asymptomatic, and the diagnosis is only made by endoscopy and&#xD;
      biopsy. It is estimated that the prevalence in the general population in Western Countries is&#xD;
      1-2% with significant geographic variation, but increases in patients undergoing endoscopic&#xD;
      procedures (4.0% in Dutch population, 5.6% USA). However, the majority of studies looking at&#xD;
      BE prevalence are confounded by the fact that most procedures were performed for GERD&#xD;
      symptoms generating selection bias. In studies performed in patients referred for colonoscopy&#xD;
      (n=1500 approximately) the prevalence of BE varied between 6.8% and 16.7%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar to oesophageal cancer, gastric cancer has its own pre-malignant precursors including&#xD;
      gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) and gastric atrophy (GA) . The endoscopic diagnosis of GA&#xD;
      and GIM however is not straightforward as the colorimetric shift from normal to pathological&#xD;
      mucosa is subtle and additional endoscopic signs such as disappearance of gastric folds can&#xD;
      be affected by the degree of air insufflation. The prevalence of GA can reach up to 33.3% in&#xD;
      Western Europeans and is higher in East Asia. For GIM, the reported population prevalence in&#xD;
      Western Countries ranges from 7 to 28.6%. These rates are however probably affected by&#xD;
      selection bias, such as enrichment of individuals affected by H. pylori infection. In a Dutch&#xD;
      study on patient referred for colonoscopy 0.8% had GA, 7.1% had both GA and GIM and 1.4% had&#xD;
      gastric dysplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For esophageal squamous dysplasia, the precursor lesion of oesophageal squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma, prevalence estimates are between 3 and 38%. This reflects the variation in&#xD;
      endoscopic methods, histopathological scoring and the studied populations from high-risk&#xD;
      geographic regions such has Korea. The prevalence of squamous dysplasia in Western Countries&#xD;
      in not well known, since it is generally very difficult to diagnose on white light endoscopy.&#xD;
      It can be argued that squamous dysplasia is vastly underdiagnosed in clinical practice as the&#xD;
      ratio between oesophageal adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma in the UK is just over&#xD;
      2:1, however squamous dysplasia is rarely diagnosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duodenal adenoma is another understudied pre-malignant lesion that can in fact undergo&#xD;
      malignant transformation in 30-85% of cases and as such, needs to be recognised and treated&#xD;
      early and definitively . These occur very often in the context of familial adenomatous&#xD;
      polyposis (FAP) syndrome, whereas sporadic duodenal adenomas are much rarer with a prevalence&#xD;
      of 0.03-0.4% (32, 33).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of studies looking at prevalence of pre-malignant upper GI conditions in the&#xD;
      general population referred for EGD are limited by the lack of standardised endoscopy and&#xD;
      biopsy protocols. In addition, none of the studies looked at variation of prevalence based on&#xD;
      experience. Furthermore, no expert review of endoscopic images has been performed to ensure&#xD;
      quality of the diagnosis. Although quality standards in upper GI endoscopy have been proposed&#xD;
      by the British Society of Gastroenterology and European Society of Gastrointestinal&#xD;
      Endoscopy, the majority of the statements in these guidelines have a low level of evidence&#xD;
      and weak to moderate strength of the recommendation. Most importantly, none of the statements&#xD;
      refer to diagnostic KPI, given that the expected detection rate of the upper GI&#xD;
      pre-neoplastic and early neoplastic lesions at endoscopy is unknown. This represents a gap&#xD;
      that our study aims to tackle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS The hypothesis is that the prevalence of upper Gi pre-malignant condition is&#xD;
      underestimated based on available literature data and that the detection rate of&#xD;
      pre-cancerous upper GI lesions improves with a more rigorous and systematic approach to&#xD;
      performing EGD. In the future, using diagnostic KPI to monitor performance of upper GI&#xD;
      endoscopists will result in improved outcomes of oesophago-gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES The aim of this study is to assess endoscopic and pathological outcomes&#xD;
      during routine EGD using standard photo-documentation and biopsy protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to define the prevalence of pre-malignant or early malignant upper&#xD;
      GI tract lesions as measured by a standardised endoscopy and biopsy protocol. This is further&#xD;
      broken down into categories of pre-malignant pathology, namely: 1) Barrett's esophagus with&#xD;
      and without dysplasia; 2) squamous dysplasia;, 3) gastric atrophy/gastric intestinal&#xD;
      metaplasia; , 4) gastric adenoma; and 5) duodenal adenoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Missed rate of endoscopic diagnosis compared to pathological diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Missed rate of endoscopic diagnosis compared to expert review of endoscopic photos&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Correlation between duration of the endoscopy and detection of pre-neoplastic and&#xD;
           neoplastic lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Quality of the endoscopic pictures taken in routine endoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Correlation between endoscopist experience and rate of detection&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Correlation between use of image enhanced endoscopy and rate of detection&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Interobserver agreement among expert and not expert endoscopists&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Correlation between life-style factors and pathological outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN This will be a multicenter population study. Recruiting centers will be a range&#xD;
      of Teaching and District General Hospitals in England. 1000 patients referred for urgent or&#xD;
      routine endoscopy to evaluate upper GI symptoms will be recruited. The detection rates of&#xD;
      upper GI tract pre-malignant lesions in our study procedures will be compared to standard&#xD;
      historical data from each participating institution. An equivalent population from the year&#xD;
      prior to the start of recruitment, matched for age, sex, indication for endoscopy and&#xD;
      referral pathway, will be retrieved from the archives of each participating NHS Trust and&#xD;
      directly contrasted to this study population to evaluate whether the detection rate of&#xD;
      pre-malignant upper GI tract lesions improves with a more rigorous and systematic approach to&#xD;
      performing EGD using a standardized photo documentation and biopsy protocol. In this way, the&#xD;
      investigators can evaluate the immediate impact of our study and the utility of the proposed&#xD;
      diagnostic KPI. As an example, the investigators already have date to show that in 2019 over&#xD;
      8,500 EGD were performed in Cambridge alone, of which 53% had biopsies taken. Based on&#xD;
      matched pathology record, only 29 new diagnoses of GA or GIM were made during the same time&#xD;
      period, suggesting the possibility of large under-detection of premalignant stomach. The&#xD;
      endoscopic pictures will be evaluated by two expert endoscopists with interest in detection&#xD;
      and treatment of upper GI pre-malignant and early malignant conditions. The quality of the&#xD;
      pictures will be scored on a visual analogue scale based on two parameters: optical quality&#xD;
      and representation of the intended section of the upper GI tract. The endoscopists will note&#xD;
      the presence of premalignant conditions. In case of disagreement, a third investigator will&#xD;
      review the picture to achieve a gold standard endoscopic diagnosis.&#xD;
