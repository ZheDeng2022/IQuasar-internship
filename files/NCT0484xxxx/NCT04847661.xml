      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Mefloquine as a prophylaxis&#xD;
      against SARS-Cov-2 infection in household contacts of COVID 19 confirmed. This study is an&#xD;
      open-label, randomized, placebo controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 1500 household contacts of COVID-19 confirmed cases who will attend triaging&#xD;
      clinic of 5 Egyptian university centers (Helwan university hospital, Ain Shams university&#xD;
      hospital, Assiut University Hospital, Fayoum university hospital and Tanta university&#xD;
      hospital). The household contacts of COVID-19 confirmed subjects with a decision for&#xD;
      home-isolation will be recruited to participate into this study. The recruited subjects from&#xD;
      each center will be randomly assigned (locally in that center) into 2 groups (750 volunteer&#xD;
      in each group). The 1st group will receive Mefloquine (1100-1650 mg according to body&#xD;
      weight), orally, while the other group will receive the same number of placebo tablets&#xD;
      (control group). Previous infection will be excluded for all recruited subjects by testing&#xD;
      for the presence of anti-bodies against COVID-19 to exclude previous infection. Subjects who&#xD;
      are tested negative will be allocated into one of the 2 study groups after randomization, and&#xD;
      treatment will be started immediately (either mefloquine or placebo). In addition, a&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal swap will be taken from each recruited subject and tested by PCR for COVID-19&#xD;
      to exclude current infection. After having the PCR results, positive cases will be analyzed&#xD;
      separately to test for the disease severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurological and cardiac assessment will be done for all volunteers before recruitment to&#xD;
      exclude the presence of any contraindication for Mefloquine intake. Both groups will be&#xD;
      followed up clinically to detect any symptom or sign of COVID-19 infection for 2 weeks&#xD;
      (during the period of home isolation). Nasopharyngeal swap with PCR for COVID-19 will be done&#xD;
      for all included subjects at the end of the follow-up period (14 days), or at the appearance&#xD;
      of symptoms or signs suggesting COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end points of the study are either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  End of follow up period (2 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 infection during the study time Initial severity&#xD;
           assessment of COVID-19 infection will be done in all infected subjects in both groups to&#xD;
           compare severity, in addition to following up of the fate of the infected subjects.&#xD;

&#xD;
      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Mefloquine as a prophylaxis against SARS-Cov-2&#xD;
      infection in household contacts of COVID 19 confirmed cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluating the role of Mefloquine in preventing SARS-Cov-2 infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the side effects that may result from the usage of Mefloquine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Comparing the clinical severity/outcome of COVID-19 disease in infected subjects who&#xD;
      received Mefloquine compared to those who did not receive the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an open-label, randomized, placebo controlled trial. A total of 1500 household&#xD;
      contacts of COVID-19 confirmed cases who will attend triaging clinic of 5 Egyptian university&#xD;
      centers (Helwan university hospital, Ain Shams university hospital, Assiut University&#xD;
      Hospital, Fayoum university hospital and Tanta university hospital). The household contacts&#xD;
      of COVID-19 confirmed subjects with a decision for home-isolation will be recruited to&#xD;
      participate into this study. The recruited subjects from each center will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned (locally in that center) into 2 groups (750 volunteer in each group). The 1st group&#xD;
      will receive Mefloquine (1100-1650 mg according to body weight), orally, while the other&#xD;
      group will receive the same number of placebo tablets (control group). Previous infection&#xD;
      will be excluded for all recruited subjects by testing for the presence of anti-bodies&#xD;
      against COVID-19 to exclude previous infection. Subjects who are tested negative will be&#xD;
      allocated into one of the 2 study groups after randomization, and treatment will be started&#xD;
      immediately (either mefloquine or placebo). In addition, a nasopharyngeal swap will be taken&#xD;
      from each recruited subject and tested by PCR for COVID-19 to exclude current infection.&#xD;
      After having the PCR results, positive cases will be analyzed separately to test for the&#xD;
      disease severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurological and cardiac assessment will be done for all volunteers before recruitment to&#xD;
      exclude the presence of any contraindication for Mefloquine intake. Both groups will be&#xD;
      followed up clinically to detect any symptom or sign of COVID-19 infection for 2 weeks&#xD;
      (during the period of home isolation). Nasopharyngeal swap with PCR for COVID-19 will be done&#xD;
      for all included subjects at the end of the follow-up period (14 days), or at the appearance&#xD;
      of symptoms or signs suggesting COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end points of the study are either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  End of follow up period (2 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 infection during the study time Initial severity&#xD;
           assessment of COVID-19 infection will be done in all infected subjects in both groups to&#xD;
           compare severity, in addition to following up of the fate of the infected subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. The trial will be conducted&#xD;
      in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Good Clinical&#xD;
      Practice guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonisation. The investigators vouch&#xD;
      for data completeness and accuracy and adherence to the trial protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include volunteers household contact of COVID 19 confirmed cases who attend&#xD;
      the triage clinic in the participating centers. Included persons should be &gt; 18 years old and&#xD;
      below 65 years, without any contraindications for Mefloquine usage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People with history of previous confirmed COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnant and lactating females.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People with neuropsychiatric disorders: myasthenia gravis, epilepsy, psychotic disorder,&#xD;
           schizophrenia, repeated episodes of anxiety, depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People with liver cirrhosis or raised liver enzymes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People with arrhythmias or prolonged QT interval on EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People with a history of Quinidine-Quinine analogs allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mefloquine dose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mefloquine hydrochloride will be given in a dose of 1100-1650 mg, according to body weight&#xD;
      (BW), splitted into two to three doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30kg≤BW&lt;45kg: 825mg followed by 275mg after 6-8 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  45kg≤BW&lt;60kg: 825mg followed by 550mg after 6-8 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  60kg≤BW: 825mg followed by 550mg after 6-8 hours and then 275mg 6-8 hours after the&#xD;
           second dose Placebo A similar tablet of non-active gradients was specifically&#xD;
           manufactured for the study by EVA Pharma company. The placebo tablets exactly resemble&#xD;
           the active treatment mefloquine tablets (the same shape, size and color).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding and randomization The participants will be assigned randomly (locally in each&#xD;
      center) in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Mefloquine (1100-1650 mg according to body weight),&#xD;
      orally, or to receive the same number of placebo tablets (control group).Patients will be&#xD;
      sequentially assigned a randomization number that was generated by an independent&#xD;
      statistician. Randomization sequence will be provided in pre-sealed envelopes by the central&#xD;
      co-ordination committee of the study. Individuals involved in randomization and masking will&#xD;
      have no involvement in the rest of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) DSMB will be appointed by the study principal&#xD;
      investigator. The suggested committee will be independent from the investigator team. DSMB&#xD;
      will be responsible for 1) periodically review and evaluate the accumulated study data for&#xD;
      participant safety, study conduct and progress, and, when appropriate, efficacy, and 2) make&#xD;
      recommendations to the investigator team concerning the continuation, modification, or&#xD;
      termination of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and Laboratory Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 antibodies (rapid test; IgG and IgM) will be done before randomization; positive&#xD;
      test result will be an exclusion critera, while those with negative results will be included&#xD;
      in the study. Clinical, Laboratory data, and nasopharyngeal swab results will be done and&#xD;
      recorded at the time of randomization and after 2 weeks, or when symptoms or signs of&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection appeared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infection will be checked through quantitative real-time RT-PCR testing for serial&#xD;
      oropharyngeal swab samples obtained at the same dates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Efficacy outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The efficacy of Mefloquine will be measured by the detection of the difference in&#xD;
                the rate of COVID-19 infection in both groups from the time of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Severity of the disease for those infected during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Safety Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety outcomes including adverse events that will occur during treatment, serious adverse&#xD;
      events, and premature discontinuation of treatment will be assessed and classified according&#xD;
      to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0.&#xD;

       10. Data entery specialist Statistical Analysis Sample size: 1500 volanteer (750 in each&#xD;
           group). We are planning a study of independent 2 groups with 1 control(s) per case.&#xD;
           Prior data indicate that the incidence of infection among controls is 15%. If the true&#xD;
           incidence of infection rate for experimental subjects is 10%, we will need to study 686&#xD;
           experimental subjects and 686 control subjects to be able to reject the null hypothesis&#xD;
           that the failure rates for experimental and control subjects are equal with probability&#xD;
           (power) 0.8. The Type I error probability associated with this test of this null&#xD;
           hypothesis is 0.05. Based on this calculation, a total of 750 subject in each group will&#xD;
           be calculated to compensate for the droup outs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods The data will be analyzed by SPSS V. 23 (SPSS Inc. Released 2015. IBM&#xD;
      SPSS statistics for windows, version 23.0, Armnok, NY: IBM Corp.). Data will be expressed in&#xD;
      Number (No), percentage (%) mean (x̅), and standard deviation (SD). OneWay ANOVA is a test of&#xD;
      significance that will be used for comparison of quantitative variables of normally&#xD;
      distributed data. In contrast, the Kruskal-Wallis test will be used for the comparison of&#xD;
      quantitative variables between three groups of not normally distributed data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary efficacy analysis will be on an intention-to-treat basis and will include all the&#xD;
      persons who will be randomized. The time to clinical improvement will be described by&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier plot and compared with a log-rank test. Hazard ratios with 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals will be calculated through the Cox proportional-hazards model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Equipment All participating centers are well equipped with the necessary equipment; either&#xD;
      for patients care, laboratory testing, or radiology services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cofedinitiality:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Protection of Subject Privacy - All volunteers are assured of their confidentiality both&#xD;
      verbally and in the informed consent forms. The facilities are strictly limited to the staff&#xD;
      of the research institution, clinics and to research volunteers. This is accomplished by a&#xD;
      variety of stringent security measures. All medical records are to be stored in locked areas.&#xD;
      Access to these areas is limited to the clinical support staff and the PI of the study.&#xD;
      Volunteers' medical records are filed according to ID numbers. All forms on the chart, with&#xD;
      the exception of consent form, display only the ID number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Database Protection - Electronic data storage is similarly restricted with only the data&#xD;
      management staff having access to databases containing confidential clinical records, i.e.&#xD;
      those containing name or other identifying information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Confidentiality during AE Reporting - Adverse events will be reported to the study PI,&#xD;
      DSMB and notified to the IRB throughout the trial. Adverse event data will be analyzed&#xD;
      quarterly, but serious or life-threatening adverse events require immediate reporting and&#xD;
      follow-up. AE reports and quarterly summaries will not include subject-identifiable material.&#xD;
      Each will include the identification code only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety review plan and study termination The study PI will monitor the progress of the study&#xD;
      weekly, including reasons for attrition and whether all participants met entry criteria.&#xD;
      Further, progress and safety will be reviewed quarterly. These progress reports will include&#xD;
      information on recruitment, retention/attrition, and AEs and will be provided to the DSMB&#xD;
      quarterly. DSMB will also receive a yearly report that details data relevant to the possible&#xD;
      early termination of the study. We plan an interim analysis for possible early trial&#xD;
      termination for superiority or futility of the experimental therapy. The interim analysis&#xD;
      will be performed by an independent statistician. The analysis will be performed on the&#xD;
      primary endpoint when 50% (n=750) of patients have been randomized and have completed the 14&#xD;
      days follow-up with the second nasopharyngeal swap done.&#xD;
