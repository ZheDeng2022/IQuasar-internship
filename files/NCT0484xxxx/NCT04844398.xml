  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims at investigating short-term effects of clown visits by RED NOSES&#xD;
      Clowndoctors Austria in children and adolescents in psychiatric care without control group.&#xD;
      It is assumed that children and adolescents involved in an interaction with the clowns will&#xD;
      experience a shift in their focus. Individual attention and distraction from painful emotions&#xD;
      have the ability to redirect their attention to the current pleasurable moment and increase&#xD;
      their level of energy. Scientific evidence has shown that the distraction and switch to&#xD;
      positive emotions associated with healthcare clowning can decrease the level of stress and&#xD;
      pain (Vagnoli et al., 2005; Dionigi et al., 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study examines subjective and physiological stress levels of participants receiving clown&#xD;
      visits in a group setting on a weekly basis. Using a non-controlled pre-/post-test design,&#xD;
      the level of salivary cortisol and self-reported stress and mood will be measured before and&#xD;
      after each clown visit over four consecutive weeks. Additionally, effects on care staff at&#xD;
      the health facilities will be assessed based on a questionnaire after each clown visit within&#xD;
      the same time period of four weeks. The sample will consist of approximately 40 children and&#xD;
      adolescents in inpatient or outpatient psychiatric care. The examined intervention, i.e.&#xD;
      clown visits by RED NOSES Clowndoctors Austria, is an integral part within the selected&#xD;
      psychiatric health care institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Children and adolescents will report a reduced subjective stress level and better mood&#xD;
           states in the three assessed dimensions (good - bad mood; alertness - tiredness;&#xD;
           calmness - restlessness) after the experience of a clown visit (post-test) compared to&#xD;
           before the clown visit (pre-test) independent of age and gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Children and adolescents will display a reduced cortisol level after the experience of a&#xD;
           clown visit (post-test) compared to before the clown visit (pre-test) independent of age&#xD;
           and gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The more frequently children and adolescents experience the weekly clown visits over the&#xD;
           course of the four-week study, the stronger the stress-reducing and mood-enhancing&#xD;
           effects in the pre-/post-comparison will be over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Self-reported perceptions of care staff at the health facilities will indicate a&#xD;
           positive effect of the clown visits on their own individual moods, the atmosphere within&#xD;
           the care team, and the patients' well-being.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This pilot study will examine the effects of clown visits by RED NOSES Clowndoctors Austria&#xD;
      on physiological and psychological stress indicators in approximately 40 children and&#xD;
      adolescents aged between 7 and 18 years in Austrian inpatient or outpatient psychiatric&#xD;
      health care institutions (without control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collection process will start with a baseline assessment on participants' general&#xD;
      mental and physical health status, perceived stress, and coping with stress using&#xD;
      standardized questionnaires. Subsequently, both salivary cortisol as well as self-reported&#xD;
      stress and mood states of children and adolescents will be collected before and after each&#xD;
      clown visit on a weekly basis over four consecutive weeks (pre-/post-test design). Saliva&#xD;
      samples of cortisol are collected as a marker for the physiological stress response of&#xD;
      participants. We will use Salicaps collection devices consisting of collection tubes and&#xD;
      straws. Participants will be thoroughly instructed to collect accumulated saliva for two&#xD;
      minutes without swallowing. After the two minutes, participants will transfer the accumulated&#xD;
      saliva into the Salicap tube via the straw. Furthermore, self-reported stress levels and&#xD;
      different dimensions of current mood states (good - bad mood; alertness - tiredness; calmness&#xD;
      - restlessness) of children and adolescents are assessed by self-developed visual analogue&#xD;
      scales and standardized questionnaires. In addition, representatives of the care staff at the&#xD;
      health facilities will be asked to complete a questionnaire about their personal perception&#xD;
      on the effects of clown visits on their own individual mood, the atmosphere within the care&#xD;
      team, and the patients' well-being after each clown visit within the same time period of four&#xD;
      weeks. The application of questionnaires is paper-based (paper-pencil). All data collected&#xD;
      will be treated in a pseudonymized form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from selected psychiatric health care facilities in Austria.&#xD;
      The recruitment process of children and adolescents will be initiated by a briefing interview&#xD;
      with the care staff at the relevant facilities. In this briefing, the staff will be informed&#xD;
      in detail about the study goals and all data collection procedures and will have the&#xD;
      opportunity to evaluate the participation of the children and adolescents independently (cf.&#xD;
      eligibility criteria). No sensitive data will be shared with the research team at that point.&#xD;
      The staff will further support in obtaining the written consent from parents or legal&#xD;
      guardians prior to the start of data collection.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will receive one clown visit per week over four weeks in a group setting. The visits will take place in at least two different wards of each participating psychiatric care facility. In each ward, max. 10 participants will be targeted. The visits are carried out routinely by two professional clown artists from RED NOSES Clowndoctors Austria. The duration of the visits and the specific artistic sequences will take place according to internally organized routines. The essence of the clown visit is to catch the patient's attention proactively and reach the highest level of engagement possible. The specific artistic sequences are implemented spontaneously according to the situational atmosphere and current mood of participants. One clown visit will last between 1 and 2 hours depending on age and number of participants. Each participant will be engaged between 5 and 10 minutes by the clown. The clown artists are not involved in any study-related research activities.</description>
