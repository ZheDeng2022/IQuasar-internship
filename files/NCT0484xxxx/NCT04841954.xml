  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemp is a plant of the Cannabaceae family. Cannabis sativa, derived from female flowers, is&#xD;
      the first illicit substance used by adolescents and is a major public health problem. Its&#xD;
      psycho-active effects come from tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike recreational cannabis, industrial hemp derived from cannabis sativa has a high level&#xD;
      of cannabidiol (CBD) but a negligible level of tetrahydrocannabinol. Its seeds are now&#xD;
      consumed in various forms and generate increasing interest. Seeds have many nutritional&#xD;
      benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It seems important to take an interest in hemp, given the recent expansion of medical&#xD;
      cannabis and the increasing use of cannabis for recreational purposes. It is incriminated in&#xD;
      various allergies (contact dermatitis, asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis) but also in the&#xD;
      occurrence of anaphylaxis to certain foods by cross-allergy in atopic subjects, in&#xD;
      association with an Lipid-Transfer Proteins (LTP protein), present in the flower of Cannabis&#xD;
      sativa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike the allergy to recreational cannabis, the allergenicity of hemp seeds is little&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemp seed can cause severe anaphylactic reactions. In all reported cases, the prick-tests&#xD;
      were positive for the seeds. Often, patients had never been in contact with hemp seeds but&#xD;
      had already been exposed to cannabis by respiratory or manual routes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that sensitization by the skin or respiratory route (cannabis&#xD;
      smokers, passive exposure to cannabis, workers exposed to hemp, etc.) could lead to the&#xD;
      development of a food allergy to hemp seed.&#xD;
