  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prevalence of food allergy in the world has been inscreasing in recent years. Among nut&#xD;
      allergy, hazelnut allergy is the most widespread in Europe and particularly in France. The&#xD;
      current treatment for hazelnut allergy is based on eviction and wearing of an emergency kit&#xD;
      with adrenaline auto-injector pens, to be used in the event of severe anaphylactic reaction.&#xD;
      Oral immunotherapy (OIT) is a treatment that is now increasingly being offered as an&#xD;
      alternatice to eviction. There are few published data concerning hazelnut OIT in Europe,&#xD;
      where its consumption is nevertheless very high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of our study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the hazelnut OIT&#xD;
      protocol, implemented since 2015 in the pneumology and allergology-paediatric department of&#xD;
      the Mother and Child Hospital in Bron, in hazelnut allergic children under 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives will be to evaluate the biological efficacy and clinical tolerance&#xD;
      of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is retrospective and observational, and is based on the collection of medical data&#xD;
      from patient records.&#xD;
