      TRANS&amp;VIH is a national survey that will explore condition of vulnerability and trajectory of&#xD;
      transgender people living with HIV. To fulfill this purpose, clinical data from medical&#xD;
      registry and socio-behavioral information collected through questionnaire, will help to&#xD;
      explore this questions about vulnerability and condition of transgender people living with&#xD;
      HIV.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In France, transgender still a taboo subject, and is poorly documented. There are no precise&#xD;
      data on the number of transgender people in France or on their socio-demographic&#xD;
      characteristics. The absence of such data reinforces their invisibility in social life and&#xD;
      contributes to their stigmatization. Transgender people faces many social barriers in our&#xD;
      society. These barriers accumulate in HIV seropositive transgender people (TRHIV), and most&#xD;
      likely increase the burden of HIV infection. The main objective of ANRS TRANS&amp;VIH - the&#xD;
      community-based research study presented here - is to identify personal and social situations&#xD;
      of vulnerability for TRHIV in France, the obstacles for receiving medical care, and their&#xD;
      healthcare needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANRS TRANS&amp;VIH is an ongoing national, exhaustive, cross-sectional survey of all TRHIV&#xD;
      currently followed up in HIV services in France. It is a mixed-methods study, the&#xD;
      quantitative and qualitative components includ TRHIV women and men, respectively.&#xD;
      Socio-behavioral and medical data are collected (start date January 2021) by community-based&#xD;
      interviewers in participating hospital-based HIV structures in order to explore patient care&#xD;
      pathways and living conditions of the TRHIV population with regard to transitioning and HIV.&#xD;
      This is the first study in France to collect such data. The statistical techniques used for&#xD;
      the data analyses will reflect the study's objectives and will be adapted to the type of data&#xD;
      collection used: cross-sectional (questionnaires) and longitudinal (life history). Several&#xD;
      types of analyses will be performed, including: (i) a description of the individual&#xD;
      characteristics of transgender female TRHIV; (ii) comparative analyses between different&#xD;
      groups of stakeholders (e.g., differences between the Ile de France region (which covers&#xD;
      Paris and the surrounding area) and other regions); (iii) analysis of life and HIV&#xD;
      trajectories; (iv) structural analyses using structural data collected for participating HIV&#xD;
      structures (v) qualitative analysis of data from interviews with participating TRHIV men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANRS TRANS&amp;VIH results will be used to make recommendations to health authorities to ensure&#xD;
      that a comprehensive healthcare package will be offered to TRHIV which takes into account&#xD;
      this population's specific background and problems.&#xD;

        People who self-define as transgender, or who present themselves with a gender different&#xD;
        from the one they were assigned at birth (transgender woman or transgender man), living&#xD;
        with HIV (TRHIV), and followed in hospitals in metropolitan France and the country's&#xD;
        overseas territories.&#xD;
&#xD;
        TRHIV frequenting hospital-based HIV services in France. In 2018, an exploratory survey in&#xD;
        258 such hospital services, allowed the estimation of the study population: 852 TRHIV women&#xD;
        and 5 TRHIV men. Given the small size of the active patient file, we decided to survey all&#xD;
        the TRHIV who agreed to participate in ANRS Trans &amp; HIV, in order to highlight possible&#xD;
        disparities in HIV and transition care.&#xD;
