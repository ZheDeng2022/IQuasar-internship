    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how well pioglitazone, when used with cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy, works at helping people who have recently stopped using cocaine to&#xD;
      continue to not use cocaine.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over one million American adults suffer from cocaine use disorder (CUD) with recent trends&#xD;
      showing an increase in cocaine-related deaths since 2010. For the chronic cocaine user,&#xD;
      significant changes in brain function and structure set the stage for relapse that,&#xD;
      unfortunately, continues to be the most common outcome following treatment. For substance use&#xD;
      disorders, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is arguably the most empirically supported and&#xD;
      widely used relapse prevention approach. Considered to be a cognitive control therapy, CBT&#xD;
      aims to improve 'top-down' executive control functions that are impaired in CUD and strongly&#xD;
      connected to relapse. Converging evidence suggests that CBT promotes meaningful changes in&#xD;
      brain regions associated with cognitive control. Still, many patients with cognitive&#xD;
      impairments show suboptimal response to CBT, bolstering the call for research aimed at&#xD;
      improving effects with integrative treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this project is to enhance the relapse-prevention effects of CBT with adjunctive&#xD;
      use of pioglitazone (PIO), a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-Î³)&#xD;
      agonist. Unlike traditional medications that target classic neurotransmitter systems, PIO's&#xD;
      activation of the PPAR pathway confers broad spectrum anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective&#xD;
      effects against insult to brain white matter (WM). The functional significance of WM in CUD&#xD;
      has been well established by evidence showing that: (1) chronic cocaine exposure alters WM&#xD;
      structural integrity; (2) WM alterations compromise cognitive function in CUD; and (2) better&#xD;
      WM integrity predicts better CUD treatment outcome. In a recent proof of concept trial it was&#xD;
      found that PIO significantly improved brain WM integrity in a small sample of non-abstinent&#xD;
      patients with CUD. Treatment with PIO was well-tolerated and associated with reduced cocaine&#xD;
      craving relative to placebo. Collectively, these findings raise the exciting possibility that&#xD;
      PIO may augment responding to CBT via improved neural structure and cognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized double-blind clinical trial will be utilized to evaluate the efficacy of CBT&#xD;
      with adjunctive PIO in recently abstinent patients during the early phase of recovery when&#xD;
      craving is prominent, relapse risk is high, and intact cognitive control is required to&#xD;
      actively maintain abstinence. Upon completion of a 5-day inpatient detoxification, 60 adults&#xD;
      with CUD will complete titration to full dose of randomized medication, either PIO (45mg&#xD;
      daily) or placebo, and begin 12 weeks of outpatient CBT treatment while continuing to receive&#xD;
      study medication. Specific aims will examine the effects of PIO on targeted mechanisms of&#xD;
      change (WM integrity, cognitive function, cocaine craving) and demonstrate evidence linking&#xD;
      clinical efficacy (abstinence, functional health) with mechanism engagement. Expected results&#xD;
      will establish PIO as an adjunctive treatment that can be integrated with CBT to reduce&#xD;
      relapse risk following detoxification, thereby meeting NIDA's strategic priority of&#xD;
      evaluating the use of medications to improve the efficacy of behavioral interventions&#xD;
      (PA-18-055).&#xD;
