  <brief_summary>

      This multi-center clinical study will evaluate the efficacy of Rituximab maintenance&#xD;
      treatment of newly diagnosed follicular lymphoma after induction therapy of BR, RCHOP or R2.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Follicular lymphoma (FL) is a lymphoma of B cells in follicular center. It is a common&#xD;
      pathological subtype of lymphoma, and its incidence rate is only next to diffuse large B cell&#xD;
      lymphoma (DLBCL). The initial remission rate is high, but the tumor generally recurrent,&#xD;
      making it difficult to be completely cured. This study attempts to explore the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of rituximab monotherapy maintenance after BR, RCHOP, R2 regimen induction therapy in&#xD;
      the treatment of follicular patients, and to find the best way to maximize survival benefit&#xD;
      and reduce treatment toxicity for FL patients. The study can improve the quality of life,&#xD;
      prolong the survival and avoid the transformation to invasive lymphoma in patients with&#xD;
      follicular lymphoma.&#xD;

    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events</description>
