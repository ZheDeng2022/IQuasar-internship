    <textblock>
      A cross-sectional study will be conducted to report oral complications during chemo and&#xD;
      radiotherapy treatment in case of patients diagnosed with head and neck cancer and the effect&#xD;
      of theses oral side effects on patients' quality of life which will in turn allow the&#xD;
      implication of preventive measures&#xD;

      the primary out come of this study is to report oral side effects associated with chemo and&#xD;
      radiotherapy used for treating head and neck cancer .patient will be enrolled and data will&#xD;
      be collected from the national institute of cancer in Egypt. this will be done through&#xD;
      filling the modified ( Edmonton Symptom Assessment System) ESAS questionnaire used to asses&#xD;
      different oral side effects in cancer patients. history taking and Clinical examination will&#xD;
      be done for each patient enrolled in the study after obtaining their consent form by the main&#xD;
      investigator. each and every oral manifestations will be measured by a specific scale . the&#xD;
      secondary outcome is identified as the assessment of the effect of oral complications on&#xD;
      patients' quality of life which will be determined through completing UW-QOL(University of&#xD;
      Washington-Quality Of Life) questionnaire version 4.during the study, patient , treatment and&#xD;
      tumor variable will be considered and documented .Data collected form the patient and or from&#xD;
      medical records will be saved and tabulated on computer for back up and finally statistically&#xD;
      analyzed. A power analysis was designed to have adequate power to apply a statistical test of&#xD;
      the research question regarding the degree to which oral adverse events can prevail among&#xD;
      patients receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy. According to the results of Minhas, Sadia,&#xD;
      et al. -in which prevalence of oral adverse events was (92.6%)- and by adopting a confidence&#xD;
      interval of (95%), a margin of error of (3%) with finite population correction; the predicted&#xD;
      sample size (n) was a total of (292) cases. Sample size calculation was performed using Epi&#xD;
      info for windows version 7.2&#xD;
