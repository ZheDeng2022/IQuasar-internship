  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a growing concern in the world with an estimated 9.3% of adults, ages 20-79, with&#xD;
      it in 2019, type 2 diabetes accounting for 90% of this total. A common recommendation for&#xD;
      individuals with diabetes is to limit sugars and sweets as it may cause a high blood glucose&#xD;
      response. As a result, chocolate is often avoided due to the sugar content; though,&#xD;
      high-polyphenol chocolate may have a beneficial effect on hyperglycaemia and vascular&#xD;
      function. The sugar-free chocolate from Ross Chocolates is formulated with a blend of inulin,&#xD;
      erythritol, and stevia. These alternatives to sugar are not expected to cause a significant&#xD;
      change in blood glucose levels following consumption. The main objective of this study is to&#xD;
      verify glucose levels before and after consumption of Ross Chocolates' blend of sweeteners&#xD;
      dark chocolate and conventional chocolate in people with diabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes (10 participants each) will consume a Ross&#xD;
      Chocolate or conventional sugar-sweetened dark chocolate bar on two occasions in a randomized&#xD;
      crossover trial. Blood glucose levels will be measured by finger prick for 120 minutes after&#xD;
      consumption to determine postprandial glucose excursions after consumption of each type of&#xD;
      chocolate bar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the trial was converted to be completed remotely/virtually with&#xD;
      participants completing the testing at their home under the supervision of a research team&#xD;
      member who will describe the study procedures and monitor testing via video conferencing.&#xD;
