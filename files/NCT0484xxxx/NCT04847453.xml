    <textblock>
      This phase I/Ia trial finds the best dose and side effects of venetoclax given in combination&#xD;
      with ixazomib citrate and dexamethasone in treating patients with light chain amyloidosis&#xD;
      that has come back (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory) and who have an&#xD;
      abnormal genetic change [translocation t(11;14)]. Venetoclax may stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells by blocking Bcl-2, a protein that helps cancer cells survive. Ixazomib citrate is in a&#xD;
      class of medications called proteasome inhibitors. It works by helping to kill cancer cells.&#xD;
      Anti-inflammatory drugs such as dexamethasone reduce inflammation by lowering the body's&#xD;
      immune response and are used with other drugs in the treatment of some types of cancer.&#xD;
      Combination therapy with venetoclax, ixazomib citrate and dexamethasone may be effective in&#xD;
      treatment of relapsed or refractory light chain amyloidosis.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of venetoclax, MLN9708 (ixazomib citrate), and&#xD;
      dexamethasone when used in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      venetoclax, MLN9708 (ixazomib citrate), and dexamethasone when used in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To obtain a preliminary estimate of the&#xD;
      anti-light chain amyloidosis (AL) activity as assessed by incidence of complete hematologic&#xD;
      response (CR) and overall hematologic response (partial response [PR], very good partial&#xD;
      response [VGPR], and CR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To estimate the organ-specific response rates using standard criteria. IV. To estimate&#xD;
      progression free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate expression of BCL-2, BCL-XL, and MCL-1 on the surface of plasma cells of&#xD;
      patients with AL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe the immune profile in the peripheral blood of patients with AL before and&#xD;
      during treatment with venetoclax, MLN9708 (ixazomib citrate), and dexamethasone at multiple&#xD;
      time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To estimate hematologic response rates using mass spectrometry to detect persistence of&#xD;
      a monoclonal protein in the serum and urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To characterize the genotype of the CD138+ plasma cell in patients with AL and t(11;14)&#xD;
      and compare findings to those of patients with multiple myeloma and t(11;14) as reported in&#xD;
      prior studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine presence of minimal residual disease by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) in&#xD;
      patients achieving a hematologic CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of venetoclax and ixazomib citrate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive venetoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28, ixazomib citrate PO on&#xD;
      days 1, 8 and 15, and dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, 15 and 22. Cycles repeat every 28 days&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 1-3 months until disease&#xD;
      progression or death.&#xD;

             birefringence on polarized light microscopy and evidence of a measurable clonal&#xD;
             disease that requires active treatment. Patients must have measurable disease with&#xD;
             difference in free light chain (dFLC) &gt; 5mg/dL ( 50 mg/L). For patients who are&#xD;
             African-American, mass spectrometry must be performed to confirm subtyping&#xD;

             of treatment as defined by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines (no&#xD;
             limit on the number of prior treatments). Hematologic relapse/progression is defined&#xD;
             by the reappearance of a detectable monoclonal protein or abnormal serum free&#xD;
             light-chain ratio after having achieved a hematologic complete response or a 50%&#xD;
             increase in serum M protein or urine M protein to &gt; 0.5 g/dL or &gt; 200 mg/day,&#xD;
             respectively, or a free light-chain increase of 50% to &gt;100 mg/L in those with stable&#xD;
             disease or partial response. Refractory disease is progression on a previous line of&#xD;
             therapy without response&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  It is not known what effects MLN9708 (ixazomib citrate), venetoclax, and dexamethasone&#xD;
             have on human pregnancy or development of the embryo or fetus. Therefore, female&#xD;
             patients participating in this study should avoid becoming pregnant, and male patients&#xD;
             should avoid impregnating a female partner. Nonsterilized female patients of&#xD;
             reproductive age group and male patients should use effective methods of contraception&#xD;
             through defined periods during and after study treatment as specified below.&#xD;

                       and usual lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar,&#xD;
                       ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods] and withdrawal are not&#xD;
                       acceptable methods of contraception)&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
             Participants with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) who have a&#xD;
             legally-authorized representative (LAR) and/or family member available will also be&#xD;
             eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had major surgery or radiotherapy within 14 days prior to entering&#xD;
             the study. If the involved radiotherapy field is small, 7 days will be considered a&#xD;
             sufficient interval between treatment and administration of the MLN9708 (ixazomib&#xD;
             citrate)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy&#xD;
             (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1) with the exception of alopecia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents, within 30 days of the&#xD;
             start of this trial and throughout the duration of this trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with central nervous system involvement&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to venetoclax, MLN9708 (ixazomib citrate) (including boron or&#xD;
             boron-containing products) or dexamethasone&#xD;
&#xD;

             rifampin, St. John's wort), or moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g., bosentan, efavirenz,&#xD;
             etavirine) should be avoided&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Venetoclax should be administered using caution with substrates or inhibitors of&#xD;
             P-glycoprotein (P-gp).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to: ongoing&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Female patients who are lactating or have a positive serum pregnancy test during the&#xD;
             screening period are excluded from this study because MLN9708 (ixazomib citrate) is a&#xD;
             proteasome inhibitor with the potential for embryo-lethal effects, and an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with MLN9708 (ixazomib citrate). Patients must stop breastfeeding while on&#xD;
             MLN9708 (ixazomib citrate) and until 90 days have passed since their last dose. These&#xD;
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known gastrointestinal disease or gastrointestinal procedure that could interfere with&#xD;
             the oral absorption or tolerance of MLN9708 (ixazomib citrate), including difficulty&#xD;
             swallowing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Peripheral neuropathy that is &gt;= grade 3, or grade 2 with pain on clinical examination&#xD;

             who have received prior treatment with venetoclax&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients without measurable disease by serum free light chain, serum m-spike or urine&#xD;
             monoclonal protein&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with New York Heart Association classification III/IV. Patients with advanced&#xD;
             cardiac amyloidosis, Mayo stage IIIB based on European Modification of the 2004&#xD;
             Standard Mayo Clinic Staging in patients with advanced cardiac involvement with NT-Pro&#xD;
             BNP &gt; 8500 pg/mL (Wechalekar et al., 2013)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with grade 3 or worse diarrhea&#xD;
