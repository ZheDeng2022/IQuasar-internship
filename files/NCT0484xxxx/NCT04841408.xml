  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a prospective, monocentric, interventional study on spontaneous vaginal clearance of&#xD;
      Mycoplasma genitalium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to evaluate the spontaneous vaginal clearance of M. genitalium in&#xD;
      patients coming to perform a voluntary termination of pregnancy at the University Hospital of&#xD;
      Bordeaux at 9 weeks after a vaginal sample positive for M. genitalium&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mycoplasma genitalium is a bacterium that colonizes female genital tract and can be&#xD;
      responsible for sexually transmitted infection . M. genitalium can cause cervicitis and more&#xD;
      rarely high genital infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the vast majority of cases, presence of M. genitalium is not accompanied by any symptoms&#xD;
      and women do not develop disease. Natural history of M. genitalium infection is not well&#xD;
      documented. Some studies have shown a natural clearance of infection in women. The published&#xD;
      work mainly concerns patients at very high risk of sexually transmitted disease, but we do&#xD;
      not have French data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to study the natural clearance of M. genitalium infection in patients consulting&#xD;
      at the Orthogeny Centre of the University Hospital of Bordeaux. Results of this work will&#xD;
      allow us to have a better knowledge of the natural history of M. genitalium infection.&#xD;
