  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite high levels of adherence motivation during pregnancy, HIV treatment adherence and&#xD;
      engagement in care is difficult for women in the postpartum period. Supporting women during&#xD;
      the transition from pregnancy to postpartum is imperative to sustaining HIV treatment&#xD;
      adherence during this period. The investigators are conducting a small scale pilot study of a&#xD;
      behavioral Transition Theory-based intervention to support ART adherence and engagement in&#xD;
      ART services among pregnant and postpartum women living with HIV.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) efforts have reduced the rates of vertical&#xD;
      transmission to 2.7%, however, optimal antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence remains a&#xD;
      difficult goal to reach, particularly postpartum. Longitudinal qualitative research reveals a&#xD;
      variety of facilitators and barriers to the transition from pregnancy to postpartum including&#xD;
      employment/financial concerns, logistical concerns around childcare and breastfeeding,&#xD;
      worries about vertical transmission and difficulties bonding. This intervention draws on the&#xD;
      growing cadre of community health workers within the South African health care system and&#xD;
      Transition Theory to develop a behavioral intervention to support women living with HIV&#xD;
      through the transition from pregnancy to postpartum. The investigators are conducting a small&#xD;
      scale pilot study to compare the impact of a Transition Theory-based intervention to enhanced&#xD;
      standard of care on self-reported ART adherence and engagement in ART services among pregnant&#xD;
      and postpartum women living with HIV.&#xD;

    <measure>Preliminary efficacy - VAS</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Preliminary efficacy will be assessed as the correlation between study arm and self-reported HIV adherence on the Visual-Analog Scale (self-report, 1 item scale from 0-100, 100 indicating perfect adherence in the past month) at 6 months postpartum.</description>

    <measure>Preliminary efficacy- Retention in HIV services</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Preliminary efficacy will be assessed as the correlation between study arm and retention in HIV services at 6 months postpartum. Retention in HIV services is measured by clinic records. Retention at 6 months postpartum is measured as attended HIV clinic appointment in the past 3 months.</description>

    <measure>Preliminary efficacy-viral suppression</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Preliminary efficacy will be assessed as the correlation between study arm and viral suppression at 6 months postpartum. Viral suppression will be measured by clinic records, with viral suppression defined as HIV viral load less than 200 copies/mL.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence self-efficacy - confidence in taking medications</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence self-efficacy will be measured using the AACTG adherence self-efficacy scale, 15 items, using 5 point Likert scale ranging from not confident at all to very confident. Total scores range from 15-75, with higher scores indicating higher self-efficacy.</description>

    <intervention_name>Transition Theory-based Intervention</intervention_name>
    <description>The behavioral intervention is a theoretically driven curriculum focused on supporting mothers from pregnancy through postpartum in order to promote sustained HIV treatment adherence. Sessions utilize motivational interviewing and consist of a range of topics including motherhood, preparing for baby, disclosure, HIV education, adherence, birth experiences, support systems, and living positively.</description>
