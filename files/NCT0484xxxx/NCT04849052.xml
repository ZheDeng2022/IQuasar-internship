  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled pilot trial of a text message intervention to promote&#xD;
      physical activity in midlife adults (MASTERY), compared to an attention-matched control&#xD;
      condition. The MASTERY intervention utilizes two-way text message sessions once-weekly for 12&#xD;
      weeks focusing on performing activities to enhance well being, setting physical activity&#xD;
      goals, and learning techniques to reduce midlife-specific stress.&#xD;

      This is a randomized controlled pilot trial of a multipronged intervention to promote&#xD;
      physical activity in midlife adults (MASTERY), compared to an attention-matched control&#xD;
      condition. In MASTERY, participants will have interactive, two-way text message 'sessions'&#xD;
      (5-10 minutes of two-way text communication with an automated text-message program) once&#xD;
      weekly for 12 weeks. The messages will focus on 3 distinct areas in the same order each week:&#xD;
      (1) well-being-based skills and assigned activities, customized for midlife adults, (2)&#xD;
      physical activity content focused on setting and reaching weekly activity goals, and (3)&#xD;
      specific skills to manage midlife-related stressors that act as barriers to activity. The&#xD;
      primary outcome is objectively measured moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA).&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include feasibility and acceptability and other activity-related,&#xD;
      psychological, and functional outcomes at 12 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will complete a positive psychology activity, work towards a physical activity goal, and use a stress reduction technique, then will complete weekly text message sessions. In the first six weeks, participants will review the activities they performed the prior week, be introduced to new material, choose activities to perform that week, and set a new physical activity goal during the text message sessions.
