      The project will be pursued in our respiratory, autonomic nervous system physiology&#xD;
      laboratory (Respiratory, autonomic nervous system physiology laboratory, Department of&#xD;
      Pneumology and Intensive Care Medicine, RWTH Aachen University Hospital; Head of Department:&#xD;
      Professor Michael Dreher).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overactivity of the sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) axis with &quot;centrally&quot; increased heart&#xD;
      rate and peripheral vasoconstriction is a known phenomenon in patients with systolic heart&#xD;
      failure (HF) and has recently been described in patients with primary lung disease as seen in&#xD;
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, systematic analyses on this clinically relevant topic are currently lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, using a comprehensive, multimodal approach and state-of-the-art technology, this&#xD;
      research project is designed to determine the extent and nature of increased SNA in COPD (AIM&#xD;
      1) and evaluate the underlying mechanisms (AIM 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will address the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In COPD, concomitant obstructive sleep apnea is independently associated with increased&#xD;
           SNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Precapillary pulmonary hypertension (PH), inspiratory muscle dysfunction and systemic&#xD;
           inflammation describe a COPD phenotype characterised by increased SNA with a different&#xD;
           subtype.&#xD;

      The project will be pursued in our respiratory, autonomic nervous system physiology&#xD;
      laboratory (Respiratory, autonomic nervous system physiology laboratory, Department of&#xD;
      Pneumology and Intensive Care Medicine, RWTH Aachen University Hospital; Head of Department:&#xD;
      Professor Michael Dreher).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overactivity of the sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) axis is a known phenomenon in patients&#xD;
      with systolic heart failure (HF) and has recently been described in patients with primary&#xD;
      lung disease as seen in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, insights into the nature of and factors involved in increased SNA in COPD are urgently&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potentially obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with not only repetitive obstructions but also&#xD;
      additional hypoxia and poor sleep quality additively increase SNA in COPD. In addition,&#xD;
      inspiratory muscle dysfunction (if adequately measured by magnetic diaphragm stimulation&#xD;
      studies and comprehensive diaphragm ultrasound) with related hypercapnia, pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension (PH) and systemic inflammation all likely also impact on SNA in COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, systematic analyses on this clinically relevant topic are currently lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, using a comprehensive, multimodal approach and state-of-the-art technology, this&#xD;
      research project is designed to determine the extent and nature of increased SNA in COPD (AIM&#xD;
      1) and evaluate the underlying mechanisms (AIM 2). The project will address the following&#xD;
      hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In COPD, concomitant OSA with poor sleep is independently associated with increased&#xD;
           SNA,.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. PH, inspiratory muscle dysfunction and systemic inflammation describe a COPD phenotype&#xD;
           characterised by increased SNA, manifesting differently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test these hypotheses COPD patients without an established cardiovascular disease will be&#xD;
      enrolled and the extent, nature and mechanism of SNA increase compared with healthy controls&#xD;
      matched in a 3:1 ratio for age, sex and body mass index (BMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Invasive assessment of muscle SNA to the point of single unit recordings with analysis of&#xD;
      single postganglionic sympathetic firing, and hence SNA drive to the peripheral vasculature,&#xD;
      is the gold standard for quantification of SNA in humans but is only available in a few&#xD;
      centres worldwide because it is costly, time consuming and requires a high level of training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small substudy will investigate the short term acute treatment effects of non-invasive&#xD;
      ventilation and oxygen supplementation on SNA in patients with COPD.&#xD;
