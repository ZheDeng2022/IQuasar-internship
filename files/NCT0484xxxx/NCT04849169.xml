  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to demonstrate reasonable assurance that the Ringer catheter&#xD;
      can be safely used to manage hemorrhage due to coronary vessel perforations while&#xD;
      facilitating distal perfusion under the conditions of use prescribed in the labeling.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, multicenter, single-arm clinical study. The study will be conducted at up to&#xD;
      15 investigational sites in the US and will enroll up to 30 participants. The population for&#xD;
      this investigation is adult participants who suffer a perforation of the coronary artery&#xD;
      during a percutaneous coronary intervention requiring management of hemorrhage while&#xD;
      providing distal perfusion until definite treatment is determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical investigation is being conducted under Exception from Informed Consent (EFIC)&#xD;
      regulations because there is no reasonable way to identify patients likely to become eligible&#xD;
      for the investigation, and a coronary perforation can be a life-threatening emergency that&#xD;
      needs to be immediately controlled without enough time for the patient or their legally&#xD;
      authorized representative to give consent. Patients will be notified of their enrollment as&#xD;
      soon as feasible. For more information on the exception from informed consent, please use the&#xD;
      contact information be.ow.&#xD;
