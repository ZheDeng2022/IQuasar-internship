  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As reported in previous studies, Point-of-Care Ultrasound (POCUS) has good performance for&#xD;
      the diagnosis of bowel obstruction even when compared with CT. This inexpensive,&#xD;
      radiation-free tool is available in a majority of ED. It is performed at the patient's&#xD;
      bedside with immediate results. The learning curve allows Emergency Physicians (EP) to&#xD;
      perform this exam after a relative brief training period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to investigate the ability of POCUS performed before CT to exclude the&#xD;
      diagnosis of bowel obstruction in patients admitted for abdominal pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bowel obstruction (BO) is frequently suspected in the Emergency Department (ED). Computed&#xD;
      Tomography (CT) is commonly used to diagnose this disease. However, CT is not always&#xD;
      available in real-time, requires technician times, is associated with increased cost and&#xD;
      exposes patients to radiations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will investigate the diagnosis performances of POCUS for the diagnosis of BO&#xD;
      with comparison with CT which will be considered as the gold standard. The wain objective&#xD;
      will be the ability to exclude the diagnosis of BO, the main criteria being the negative&#xD;
      predictive value. The secondary objectives will be the diagnosis performances (sensitivity,&#xD;
      specificity, positive predictive value), duration and difficulty of POCUS&#xD;

    <description>Patients admitted to the ED with abdominal pain and suspicion of bowel obstruction : realization of a Point-of-Care Ultrasound after clinical exam by the Emergency Physician in charge as a standard of care. Beside usual findings, the investigators will search for signs of bowel obstruction: dilated and incompressible small bowel loop, back-and-forth peristalsis sign. Determination of probability of small bowel obstruction. Realization of a computed tomography in search of small bowel obstruction.</description>
