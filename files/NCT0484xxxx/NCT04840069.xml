  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the this study is to see if the use of a PET scan with 18F-fluciclovine (PET&#xD;
      or Fluciclovine PET) in addition to the normal radiation planning imaging procedures (MRI and&#xD;
      CT scan) will help determine the areas where the radiation therapy is to be delivered. It is&#xD;
      also a goal of the study to determine if subjects live longer when treatment plans for&#xD;
      radiation therapy are designed using a Fluciclovine PET scan, as well as MRI and CT scans. We&#xD;
      will also collect information on if and where the tumor returns. Information on the side&#xD;
      effects from the two different treatment planning imaging methods will also be collected.&#xD;
      18F-Fluciclovine is an FDA-approved radioactive diagnostic agent that is injected into the&#xD;
      patient and then taken up by cancer cells, which can then be visualized with a PET/CT scan.&#xD;
      18F-Fluciclovine is FDA approved for the detection of recurrent prostate cancer, but is still&#xD;
      investigational for the purposes of this study.&#xD;

      The goal of this study is to see if the use of PET in planning radiotherapy can reduce these&#xD;
      local failures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor. Newly diagnosed&#xD;
      glioblastoma management includes maximum safe resection followed by radiotherapy with&#xD;
      concurrent temozolomide, followed by maintenance temozolomide for 6 - 12 cycles. This&#xD;
      postoperative chemoradiotherapy approach has resulted in a significant increase in median PFS&#xD;
      (5.0 vs. 6.9 months) and OS (12.1 vs. 14.6 months) compared to radiotherapy alone (Stupp&#xD;
      2005). However, despite such multi-modality therapy, the median survival for GBM remains poor&#xD;
      at approximately 15-16 months in contemporary series (Grossman, Ye et al. 2010, Gilbert, Wang&#xD;
      et al. 2013 vs 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a randomized trial of tumor-treating fields (TTF or Optune) plus temozolomide&#xD;
      demonstrated the benefit of this treatment in newly diagnosed glioblastoma that led to FDA&#xD;
      approval of the device (Stupp 2015, Stupp 2017). However despite these advances, most&#xD;
      patients still have a poor prognosis with median survival of 16-21 months. Although adjuvant&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy has been shown to increase survival, a predominant pattern of failure&#xD;
      remains local (Chan, Lee et al. 2002, Milano, Okunieff et al. 2010). Therefore, better&#xD;
      therapeutic options are needed for this disease.&#xD;

CTV_5400 will include the GTV_6000 plus a margin of 1.0 cm which may be reduced around natural barriers to tumor growth such as the skull, ventricles, falx, etc. CTV_5400 must also include the entirety of the GTV_6000. There is no CTV_6000. PTV_5400 is the CTV_5400 plus a geometric 3 mm expansion in all dimensions; PTV_6000 is GTV_6000 plus a geometric 3 mm expansion in all dimensions. PTV may extend beyond bony margins and the skin surface. The PTV_5400 must contain the PTV_6000. In the setting of multi-focal disease, the primary target volumes will be defined as above, but for satellite lesions, the GTV_6000 will be defined as any tumor enhancement and hypermetabolic volume.
