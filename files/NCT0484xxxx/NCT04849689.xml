  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Body fat (BF) and muscle mass showed opposing association with mortality. Whole-food,&#xD;
      plant-based (WFPB) lifestyle programs has been on the rise lately especially due to&#xD;
      impressive health benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of research on the effectiveness of popular weight loss diets in obese subjects&#xD;
      showed 20 to 30% loss of lean muscle mass within to the total body weight loss, whereas in&#xD;
      the whole-food, plant-based (vegan) diet the loss was up to 42%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, an open research problem is to find a way how to improve body composition in an&#xD;
      effective and healthy way (i.e., losing of excess BF while maintaining muscle mass as much as&#xD;
      possible) but still using stric plant-based (vegan) diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will perform retrospective analysis of measurements of body composition and&#xD;
      phase angle values of aprox. 200 participants who were on a WFPB lifestyle program from 2016&#xD;
      to 2021 and performed two successive measurements (initial and follow up (FU)), without body&#xD;
      mass index (BMI) limitation on same medically approved and calibrated bioelectrical impedance&#xD;
      (Tanita 780 S MA, Tokyo, Japan) and were not yet included in our previous studies. A WFPB&#xD;
      lifestyle program were consisted of nutrition (i), (ii) physical activity and (iii) support&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome include the following measures: BF % and FFM and to examine the change from&#xD;
      initial values to FU values (by gender), according BMI classification (e.g,, normal,&#xD;
      pre-obese and obese) with subanalysis for those participants who lost up to 5 kg/more and&#xD;
      those who lost 5 kg or more of body weight.&#xD;

      Many people are increasingly using a variety of dietary practices to manage overweight and&#xD;
      obesity. Many people are increasingly using a variety of dietary practices to manage&#xD;
      overweight and obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will investigate the muscle mass preservation of participants on our 12-year&#xD;
      lasting ongoing, community-based (free-living), WFPB lifestyle program during the weight/fat&#xD;
      loss of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the BF %, and FFM change from initial values to FU values (for whole&#xD;
      sample and by gender).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome include correlation between BMI, BF % and FFM, and PhA. Based on our&#xD;
      experiences we believe that some participants that follow our WFPB lifestyle program may&#xD;
      initially &quot;afraid&quot; to eat, according to the instructions, each meal to satiety (ad libitum).&#xD;
      The reason lies in the typical weight loss recommendation in Western-type lifestyle that&#xD;
      advise &quot;eating less&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The body composition measures will include body height (BH; measured via standardized medical&#xD;
      approved professional personal floor scale with stand (Kern, MPE 250K100HM, Kern &amp; Sohn,&#xD;
      Balingen, Germany), body mass (BM), BF mass and BF %, FFM, bone mineral mass (BMM), visceral&#xD;
      fat (VF), total body water (TBW), extracellular water (ECW), intracellular water (ICW), the&#xD;
      ratio, whole body phase angle (PhA), all via medically approved and calibrated bioelectrical&#xD;
      impedance Tanita 780 S MA (Tanita Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and the use of corresponding&#xD;
      protocols (e.g., for BMI).&#xD;

    <description>The WFPB lifestyle program included:&#xD;
Nutrition/plant-based food (energy intake: at least 90% of whole-food, plant-based diet and ≤ 10% of energy intake from plant-based meal replacements (PBMR) and dietary supplements (e.g., vitamin B12, D, and EPA and DHA omega-3 fatty acids).&#xD;
Physical activity (habitual; organized and other).&#xD;

        that were without preference toward plant-based diet before entering to the program. As&#xD;
        healthy adults we mean that used data were from participants without serious comorbidities&#xD;
        (i.e., having autoimmune or neurodegenerative disorders), physical limitations or taking&#xD;
