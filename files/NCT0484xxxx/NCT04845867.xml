  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After thyroid surgery, 0.6 to 4% of patients develop postoperative bleeding. 90% of this&#xD;
      postoperative bleeding occurs within the first 48 hours. Most of the time, the complications&#xD;
      are rapidly progressing and require immediate attention. Up to 0.6% of patients with&#xD;
      postoperative bleeding die. In a clinical study with postoperative pressure measurements it&#xD;
      could be shown that postoperative bleeding without interruption leads to a continuous&#xD;
      increase in pressure in the neck, as is observed when coughing and pressing. Systematic&#xD;
      invasive pressure measurement in the thyroid compartment after surgery might detect a&#xD;
      continuous increase in pressure which is often caused by a growing haematoma, indicating&#xD;
      serious post-surgery bleeding at a much earlier time compared to state of the art diagnostic&#xD;
      workflow. n routine clinical care, detection of serious haemorrhage depends on the patients&#xD;
      alerting symptoms even if post-operative intermittent monitoring of vital parameters and&#xD;
      wound conditions is performed according to current medical guidelines [18] and local&#xD;
      instructions. Device-based, continuous haemorrhage detection within 36 to 48 hours after&#xD;
      surgery would allow to objectively measure an increase in cervical pressure before symptoms&#xD;
      occur, i.e. early detection of risk leading to timely therapeutic actions. Thus, the risk of&#xD;
      serious complications like hypoxic brain damage and death caused by post-operative&#xD;
      haemorrhage is minimized. In addition, the intervention team would be able to fine-tune&#xD;
      necessary actions during the rescue procedure based on objective pressure values, e.g. the&#xD;
      decision to open cutaneous sutures immediately or later in the operation theatre, and&#xD;
      therefore reduce additional perioperative morbidity and increase patients' safety.&#xD;

        HEDOS will enrol and measure presumably 1,470 eligible adult patients and follow each of&#xD;
        them for 1 month, assuming that 22 cases of clinically relevant haemorrhage within 48 hours&#xD;
        following thyroid surgery will be observed. It will be conducted in Germany and Austria&#xD;
        with about 50 clinical sites participating.&#xD;
