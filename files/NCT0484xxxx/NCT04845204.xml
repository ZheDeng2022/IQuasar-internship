  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical techniques and treatment methods of the arthroplasty have been improved and the&#xD;
      results after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are generally good. However, some patients have&#xD;
      suboptimal postoperative results with respect to pain and physical functioning and may not be&#xD;
      satisfied with the results of their TKA. Psychological symptoms were found to be associated&#xD;
      with these suboptimal results. The aim of the present study is to determine weather&#xD;
      relaxation techniques had beneficial effects on pain, sleeping quality, functional status and&#xD;
      physiological symptoms in TKA patients during their hospital stay.&#xD;

    <description>Standard postoperative rehabilitation program is applied to Control Group. Knee-based exercises were undertaken in supine (active- assisted knee flexion using a bandage, inner range quadriceps contractions, and straight-leg raises), seated (active-assisted knee flexion using the contralateral limb and inner range quadriceps contractions), and standing (hip and knee flexion, active hamstring curls, lunges on a step, hamstring stretches) postures.</description>

    <description>Relaxation Group recieve progressive muscle relaxation exercises additional to the standard exercises. The relaxation exercises are applied two times a day till the discharge day starting on the postoperative day one. Progressive muscle relaxation included the relaxing of different muscle groups along with deep breathing. The maximal contraction period consist of the contraction of muscle groups around ankle, calf, knee, hip, lumbar, thoracic and cervical regions, shoulder, arm, forearm for 5 s and continued with a relaxation period for 30 s while focusing on breathing. These two periods ware repeated for each muscle groups and lasted approximately 30 min</description>

    <description>The physiotherapy protocol is applied under the supervision of the same physiotherapist within a progressive manner immediately after surgery. Continued passive range of motion is applied twice a day starting with 45ยบ of knee flexion range of motion and increased gradually as tolerated. All patients performed same isometric, isotonic and active exercises. Patients were instructed to bear weight as tolerated on the postoperative day 1</description>
