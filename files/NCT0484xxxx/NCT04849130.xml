  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate whether the dynamic Medial Patellofemoral Ligament (MPFL)&#xD;
      reconstruction as described by Becher is a successful operation technique to prevent patella&#xD;
      instability and restore quality of life. It is to assess and compare clinical and functional&#xD;
      outcomes of dynamic and static medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The recurrent dislocation rate of conservatively treated chronic patellar instability is&#xD;
      high, therefore, it is recommended to manage it surgically. A frequently used surgical&#xD;
      technique is static medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction (e.g.&#xD;
      Schöttle-technique). A novel dynamic surgical technique according to Becher was developed,&#xD;
      addressing the most common complications occurring in static reconstruction, which are&#xD;
      malpositioning and overtensioning of the graft. This study is to assess and compare clinical&#xD;
      and functional outcomes of dynamic and static medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction.&#xD;

    <time_frame>up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient reported knee function and anterior knee pain as assessed with the Kujala score at preoperative screening, at the hospitalization time and four postoperative follow ups . The Kujala scale consists of 13 questions covering a range of physical symptoms and limitations that are presented in a multiple choice answer format, with a different point value assigned to each answer. The maximum score is 100, with higher scores indicating better function.</description>

    <measure>Change in Banff-II-score from preoperative screening, at the hospitalization time and four postoperative follow ups</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Banff Patella Instability Instrument (BPII) is a disease-specific health-related quality of life score. It is a patient-reported, disease-specific QOL score that consists of 23 questions across five domains covering symptoms/physical complains, work-related concerns, recreational activity and sport participation/competition, lifestyle, and social/emotional. Patients mark their answers on a visual analogue scale measuring 100 mm in length. Each item is equally weighted with the final score calculated as an average of the scores from all answered items. A higher score reflects a higher QOL.</description>

    <measure>Change in International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC)-2000 from preoperative screening, at the hospitalization time and four postoperative follow ups</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The IKDC includes 18 questions covering three domains: symptoms, physical activity, and function. The items are answered on Likert scales of varying values. IKDC scores are calculated by dividing the total score by the highest possible score for the items answered, and multiplying by 100, with higher scores indicating better function.</description>

    <description>The EQ-5D descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression. The five levels in each dimension are worded as (1) 'not /no problems', (2) 'slight problems', (3) 'moderate problems', (4) 'severe problems', and (5) 'unable to' (mobility, self-care, usual activities), 'extreme' (pain/depression), or 'extremely' (anxiety/depression).</description>
