  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the structural parameters, by spectral domain optical coherence&#xD;
      tomography (OCT), retinal vessel density, using OCT angiography, and visual acuity in&#xD;
      patients that received endoscopic endonasal approach for the removal of an intra-suprasellar&#xD;
      pituitary adenoma compressing the optic nerve.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary outcome was to detect the changes in visual acuity, retinal structural and&#xD;
      vascular features at 48 hours and 1 year after Endoscopic Endonasal Approach for the removal&#xD;
      of an intra-suprasellar pituitary adenoma compressing the optic nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcome was to identify potential biomarker that could predict the functional&#xD;
      recovery at 1 year follow up.&#xD;
