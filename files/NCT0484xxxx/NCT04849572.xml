  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a 12 week randomized control trial of sleep hygiene education vs. no education&#xD;
      with a cross-over to the active intervention after 6 weeks. Primary and secondary outcomes&#xD;
      will be assessed before and after a 10-20 minute sleep hygiene video (intervention).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to assess if sleep hygiene education increases sleep&#xD;
      duration and sleep quality in an Appalachian community. To accomplish these aims, the&#xD;
      investigators will assess changes in sleep duration by the Oura ring and the PSQI and Epworth&#xD;
      Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Secondary aims are to determine whether sleep hygiene education&#xD;
      decreases heart rate variability measured by the Oura ring and improves alertness as assessed&#xD;
      by psychomotor vigilance testing (PVT). Potential participants will be recruited via&#xD;
      brochures, poster displays and on-line media to participate in the study. Those eligible will&#xD;
      be asked to complete a questionnaire to record baseline demographics. The data collected will&#xD;
      be demographic information, presence of chronic medical conditions, validated sleep&#xD;
      questionnaires, PVT results and Oura ring (https://ouraring.com/) output. A total of 100&#xD;
      subjects (50 per group) will be randomized to each treatment group, stratified by gender. The&#xD;
      first group will receive the intervention and be enrolled into the trial after the run-in&#xD;
      period and the baseline data collection, and the second group will receive the intervention&#xD;
      at 6 weeks after trial start. Each subject (in both groups) will have pre- and&#xD;
      post-intervention data in this study. Therefore, the &quot;real&quot; control in this study is the&#xD;
      subject himself/herself (after taking the difference), which will minimize any confounding&#xD;
      factors/effect; If the investigators assume that more education duration will result in more&#xD;
      benefit, the investigators have a chance to assess a dose-response curve (&quot;dosage&quot; =&#xD;
      education duration). The investigators will fit a mixed-effects model with duration as a&#xD;
      fixed effect, adjusting for potential confounding variables if any.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a permuted block randomization study to assess the efficacy of the new intervention and the primary outcome variable is the sleep time. A total of 100 subjects (50 per group) will be randomized to each treatment group, stratified by gender. The first group will receive the intervention and be enrolled into the trial after the run-in period and the baseline data collection, and the second group will receive the intervention at 6 weeks after trial start.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>6 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is widely used in the field of sleep medicine as a subjective measure of a patient's sleepiness. The test is a list of eight situations in which the subjects rate their tendency to become sleepy on a scale of 0, no chance of dozing, to 3, high chance of dozing. When the subjects finish the test, add up the values of the responses. The subjects total score is based on a scale of 0 to 24. The scale estimates whether the subjects are experiencing excessive sleepiness that possibly requires medical attention.</description>

    <measure>Change in PSQI at 6 weeks in Arm 1 (≥3 points)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) contains 19 self-rated questions and 5 questions rated by the bed partner or roommate (if one is available). Only self-rated questions are included in the scoring. The 19 self-rated items are combined to form seven &quot;component&quot; scores, each of which has a range of 0-3 points. In all cases, a score of &quot;O&quot; indicates no difficulty, while a score of &quot;3&quot; indicates severe difficulty. The seven component scores are then added to yield one &quot;global&quot; score, with a range of 0-21 points, &quot;O&quot; indicating no difficulty and &quot;21 &quot; indicating severe difficulties in all areas.</description>
