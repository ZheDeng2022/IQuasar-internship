      This research project will investigate motor imagery training in stroke rehabilitation during&#xD;
      which patients receive feedback in real time from their brain activity measured with&#xD;
      ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG). The investigators hypothesize that the feedback training allows&#xD;
      to internally stimulate brain motor networks in order to promote functional recovery of the&#xD;
      hand.&#xD;

      This study will be carried out as an explorative study in order to investigate the benefits&#xD;
      of mental imagery training of hand movements guided through Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)&#xD;
      feedback after stroke. Stroke patients will be trained to mentally imagine the opening and&#xD;
      closing of the hand (hereafter named MI, Motor Imagery). During the training, the patients&#xD;
      will receive visual feedback in real time that reflects the neural activity related to motor&#xD;
      processes. The NeuroFeedback (NF) will be projected with minimal time delay to maximize the&#xD;
      neural learning. This type of brain training with feedback is thought to have significant&#xD;
      importance to stimulate the ability of the brain to reorganize and compensate for a damaged&#xD;
      region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will go through the following data collection procedure (total of 33&#xD;
      measurement sessions per RP):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 1-3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical baseline evaluations, 1 time/week MRI measurements, 1 time/week Baseline EEG&#xD;
      recordings, 1 time/week Week 4-7 MI-neurofeedback training 3 times/week Clinical intervention&#xD;
      evaluation, 1 time/week Week 8-10 Same as week 1-3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) measurements. The MRI exam will be carried out on a Siemens&#xD;
      MAGNETOM Prisma 3T scanner (head-coil with 20 channels) at baseline and at final assessment&#xD;
      session at Stockholm University Brain Imaging Centre. The MRI protocol comprises i)&#xD;
      anatomical whole brain spin-echo T1 and T2 weighted sequences for description of lesion size&#xD;
      and location ii) acquisition of T2*-weighted gradient echo EPI-BOLD images of the whole brain&#xD;
      for assessment of resting state functional connectivity of sensorimotor networks&#xD;
      (resting-state functional MRI (fMRI)), and iii) the same sequence as the previous with rest&#xD;
      interleaved by a motor imagery paradigm further described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor Imagery (MI) paradigm. The paradigm consists of instructing RP, by the use of a&#xD;
      mirrored computer screen, to either i) rest his/her mind with eyes closed, ii) mentally&#xD;
      imagine a hand movement (MI), or ii) execute a hand movement. The hand movements that are&#xD;
      instructed are either to close the hand or to open the hand and extend the fingers. RP will&#xD;
      perform several repetitions of each hand movement (MI and execution) in order to collect a&#xD;
      statistical basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline EEG recording. During the baseline EEG recordings, RP will be seated in front a&#xD;
      computer screen and perform the MI paradigm (described above). During these session, EEG,&#xD;
      EOG, EMG, and accelerometer-data will be collected and are further described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ElectroEncephaloGram (EEG), ElectroOculoGram (EOG), ElectroMyoGram (EMG) and accelerometer&#xD;
      equipment. The EEG equipment consists of a 64-electrode scalp EEG acquisition system (Brain&#xD;
      Products ActiCHamp). The 64 electrodes (active Ag/AgCl) will be distributed according to the&#xD;
      extended 10-20 reference placement system. In addition to the EEG recording, 3 electrodes&#xD;
      (passive Ag/AgCl, Brain Products) will be placed on each side of both eyes and on the earlob&#xD;
      to measure eye-movements during the experiment (EOG). EMG electrodes (passive Ag/AgCl, Brain&#xD;
      Products) will be placed over four muscles controlling the wrist and fingers according to a&#xD;
      standardized protocol. Two accelerometer-sensors (Brain Products) will be placed on the hand&#xD;
      and the index finger in order to record movement-related activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG, EOG, EMG and accelerometer data analysis. The recorded data will be further analyzed&#xD;
      offline in order to evaluate the characteristic features in the data that best describe MI of&#xD;
      hand movements. This will be performed in Matlab and Labview combining custom-made scripts&#xD;
      with already developed toolboxes (such as EEGLab, Chronux). Features to be evaluated will&#xD;
      include the evoked activity, the time-frequency spectra, phase, correlation coefficients,&#xD;
      coherency among other. When the feature that best describes MI has been identified different&#xD;
      classifier and pattern recognition methods will be evaluated in extracting the information.&#xD;
      Intelligent algorithms, Support Vector Machine (SVM), regularized linear regression, naïve&#xD;
      Bayes classifiers among others will be evaluated and compared. These are commonly used&#xD;
      methods in the field of neurotechnology and a prior comparison-study using neural data from&#xD;
      invasive recordings shows the importance of choosing a well-adapted classifier for extracting&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MI-NeuroFeedback Training (NFT). EEG, EOG, EMG and accelerometer-data will be collected as&#xD;
      described in the section &quot;EEG, EMG and accelerometer equipment&quot;. RP will perform the MI&#xD;
      paradigm without the execution of hand movements. Real-time feedback from recorded&#xD;
      EEG-activity will be provided to RP during MI. The feedback consists of a virtual hand on a&#xD;
      computer screen whose movements reflect the brain activity of RP related to MI. The recorded&#xD;
      data will be further analyzed offline with the analytic tools that are described in previous&#xD;
      section.&#xD;
