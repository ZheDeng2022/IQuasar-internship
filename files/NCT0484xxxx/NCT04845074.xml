  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anatomical total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) is a well-established treatment for pronounced&#xD;
      glenohumeral osteoarthritis. However, the effectiveness of TSA has not been compared to&#xD;
      non-surgical treatment in a randomised controlled trial. Shoulder exercises may be an&#xD;
      effective treatment for reducing pain and improving function in glenohumeral osteoarthritis.&#xD;
      The primary aim of this trial is to examine if TSA followed by standard postsurgical&#xD;
      rehabilitation is superior to a 12-week exercise programme in patients with primary&#xD;
      glenohumeral OA eligible for unilateral TSA. We hypothesise that surgical intervention&#xD;
      followed by standard rehabilitation, results in clinically relevant (18-point, on a scale&#xD;
      from 0-100) improvement compared to the exercise intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glenohumeral osteoarthritis causes pain, stiffness and weakness in the shoulder joint, and&#xD;
      furthermore, it affects activities of daily living and quality of life. Anatomical total&#xD;
      shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) is a well-established treatment for pronounced glenohumeral&#xD;
      osteoarthritis. Several studies have suggested the need for trials comparing shoulder&#xD;
      arthroplasty to non-surgical treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ProAct trial is a Nordic multicenter randomized controlled trial. Patients with&#xD;
      glenohumeral osteoarthritis, eligible for a TSA will be randomised to either TSA followed by&#xD;
      usual care or exercise only. The exercise intervention consists of 12 weeks of exercise with&#xD;
      one weekly physiotherapist-supervised exercise session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the total the Western Ontario Osteoarthritis of the Shoulder&#xD;
      index score at 12 months follow-up.Outcome assessment will be performed at baseline, and at 3&#xD;
      and 12 months and 2-, 5- and 10 years after start of surgical/non-surgical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients fulfilling the eligibility criteria but declining to participate in the randomised&#xD;
      trial will be offered the option of participating in an observational cohort using the same&#xD;
      primary end point and patient reported outcomes, but following usual clinical practice.&#xD;

    <description>WOOS consist of 19 items to be answered using a visual analog scale (VAS). Each item has a possible score ranging from 0 to 100, leading to a total WOOS score ranging from 0 to 1900, with 0 being the best. For simplicity reasons, raw scores can be converted to a percentage of the maximum score (0-100, 100 best).</description>

    <description>The exercise-group will attend a 12-week exercise program with one weekly physiotherapist-supervised session supplemented with two weekly sessions of home-based exercises. Utilisation of a predefined training protocol describing procedures and content of each session secure uniformity and standardisation of the intervention. The exercise program consists of two warm-up exercises and five exercises that target shoulder range of motion and muscle strength. Furthermore, a link to a video, informing about glenohumeral osteoarthritis, the role of exercise and exercise related pain, will be sent to all patients in the exercise-group. The physiotherapists delivering the exercise intervention are not otherwise related to the trial.</description>
