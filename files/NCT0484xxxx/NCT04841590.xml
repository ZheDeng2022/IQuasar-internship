  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infant colic (CL) is a common disorder that affects approximately 8-33% of newborns during&#xD;
      the first months of life. Typically defined as &quot;crying that lasts at least 3 hours a day, and&#xD;
      occurs at least 3 days a week over a 3-week period.&quot; Osteopathic manual therapy is presented&#xD;
      as an effective and safe alternative to CL treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to quantify possible changes in daily crying hours and&#xD;
      hours of sleep, the severity of CL, the frequency of episodes, changes in stool and possible&#xD;
      adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis argues that the application of osteopathic manual therapy in babies with&#xD;
      CL produces an improvement in the hours of daily crying, the frequency of episodes, the&#xD;
      severity of colic and the hours of sleep. A controlled RCT will be performed where the&#xD;
      evaluator and the parents will be blinded with respect to the allocation group for each&#xD;
      subject. Subjects who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      the experimental group (EG), placebo group (PG) and control group (CG) using a table of&#xD;
      random numbers by a person from outside the research. The EG diagnosis treatment using&#xD;
      techniques of osteopathic manual therapy, vertebral mobilization, cranial techniques and&#xD;
      visceral mobilization, according to the diagnostic criteria of the therapist. The PG will be&#xD;
      made up of those subjects who have been randomly assigned to said group, and completed with&#xD;
      those whose parents do not accept the condition of blinding. Subjects belonging to this group&#xD;
      will receive the application of the turned off ultrasound applied to the abdominal region for&#xD;
      10 minutes. The CG has no treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 3 procedures were performed, one per week, problems with the chronology in all&#xD;
      groups (days 0, 7 and 14 if required).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapist in charge of performing the operations will be a Physiotherapist and Osteopath&#xD;
      with more than 10 years of experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluations will be carried out by a healthcare professional with more than 10 years of&#xD;
      experience. The evaluator will be blinded. Parents blinded with respect to the allocation&#xD;
      group of each subject until the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To analyze the main variable of the study (total hours of excessive crying per day), use the&#xD;
      crying diary completed by the parents. The Infantile Colic Severity Questionnaire (ICSQ) will&#xD;
      be applied to evaluate the secondary variables (sleep, feces, frequency of episodes and&#xD;
      severity of colic).&#xD;
