      A cluster-randomised multicentre blinded clinical trial will be performed in six primary care&#xD;
      centres located in the southern metropolitan area of Barcelona (Spain). The objective is to&#xD;
      assess whether including experts on infectious diseases (ID) within the antimicrobial&#xD;
      stewardship (AMS) team of primary care achieves higher reductions on overall antibiotic&#xD;
      consumption and increases the quality of prescription in diagnosed upper respiratory and&#xD;
      urinary tract infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Centres will be randomly assigned to receive a standard-AMS or an advanced-AMS&#xD;
      (intervention). Advanced-AMS includes all standard-AMS strategies plus general practitioner&#xD;
      chance to discuss clinical cases by telephone to ID expert on working days (8:00 am to 8:00&#xD;
      pm), and by biweekly meetings.&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN. A cluster-randomised, multicentre blinded clinical trial will be conducted in&#xD;
      six primary care centres between June 2021 and June 2023.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This cluster-randomised trial uses primary care centres as a unit of analysis to avoid&#xD;
      intracentre contamination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCOPE OF STUDY. Six primary care centres in the southern metropolitan area of Barcelona.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECTS OF STUDY. General practitioners of the participating centres. Paediatricians are&#xD;
      excluded. Patients older than 14 years who have a diagnosis of upper respiratory tract or&#xD;
      urinary tract infections will be prospectively follow up to assess information related to&#xD;
      secondary outcomes. Each patient could be included more than once if the GP visit is 30 days&#xD;
      or more apart from the initial medical assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be identified following the International Classification of Diseases&#xD;
      (ICD-10) CM codes as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upper respiratory tract infection: J00, J01, J02, J03, J04, J05, J06, J31, J39, H60, H62,&#xD;
      H65, H66, H67, H83 and H92.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urinary tract infection: N10, N30, N39, N41, R82 and O23.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TIMELINE. From June to September 2021 standard-AMS will be promoted to increase understanding&#xD;
      and acceptance of AMS by general practitioners. Baseline data collection will begin on&#xD;
      October 2021 and will last six months. After these six months, on 1 April 2022, centres will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to receive an advanced-AMS, or to continue the standard-AMS. The&#xD;
      intervention will be spanned 12 months, until 31 March 2023.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMISATION. A centralised electronic computer system will generate a random list based on&#xD;
      permuted blocks. To ensure similar characteristics among centres permuted blocks will be&#xD;
      created with stratification on the total number of referral population and the number of&#xD;
      population older than 65 years old by centre. Investigators will be unaware of the block size&#xD;
      and the permutation procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY GROUPS. The 6 centres will be assigned to receive an advanced AMS or a standard AMS, 3&#xD;
      in one and 3 in another. The standard AMS will receive an standard antibiotic optimization&#xD;
      program based on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Educational campaign addressed both, to patients and health professionals, to increase&#xD;
           awareness about antibiotic indications and potential harms of its misuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Updated local antibiotic empirical guidelines for treating common infections according&#xD;
           to local resistance patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Promotion of delayed antibiotic prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Promotion of Streptococcal pyogenes antigen test (Streptotest) if bacterial tonsillitis&#xD;
           is suspected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Daily microbiological report of resistant bacteria isolates to general practitioners.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Annual reports to prescribers of main AMS outcomes at centre-level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advanced AMS group will have the same standard AMS program, enhanced with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Telephone access to ID expert on working days (8:00 am to 8:00 pm).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biweekly meetings among GP and infectious diseases experts to discuss clinical cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More detailed data are placed forward in the document.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BLINDING. Two secondary end-points (unnecessary antibiotic therapy and adequacy of therapy),&#xD;
      will be evaluated by two independent investigators who will be blinded to centre allocation.&#xD;
      Discrepant decisions among them will be discussed with a third blinded physician to achieve&#xD;
      consensus. The degree of agreement will be recorded with the kappa statistic analysis. The&#xD;
      centre allocation will not be blinded for the participating centres and general&#xD;
      practitioners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOMES. Outcomes will be measured in each primary centre with a mensual periodicity during&#xD;
      12 consecutive months. These variables are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Main objective. To assess the impact of advanced-AMS on overall antibiotic consumption&#xD;
           measured by defined daily dose of antibiotic per 1.000 inhabitants per day (DHD).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To assess the impact of the advanced-AMS on unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions in&#xD;
                diagnosed upper respiratory and urinary tract infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To evaluate the impact of the advanced-AMS on the adequacy of antibiotic&#xD;
                prescriptions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To evaluate the impact of the advanced-AMS on the total number of re-attendance to&#xD;
                general practitioners or emergency department for any reason within 30 days after&#xD;
                the initial GP evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To evaluate the impact of the advanced-AMS on the number of hospital admissions for&#xD;
                any reason within 30 days after the initial GP visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEFINITIONS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DHD are calculated by the following the World Health Organisation criteria&#xD;
           (https://www.who.int/tools/atc-ddd-toolkit/indicators).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unnecessary prescription will be considered as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  An antibiotic prescribed in upper respiratory infections, which is in disagreement&#xD;
                with the local antibiotic guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  An antibiotic is prescribed in asymptomatic bacteriuria, which is defined as having&#xD;
                a positive urine culture with ≥ 10EXP5 CFU/ml of an uropathogen in patients without&#xD;
                signs or symptoms of urinary tract infection (dysuria, urinary frequency or&#xD;
                urgency, suprapubic pain, fevers, or flank pain). Pregnant women and patients&#xD;
                undergoing urologic interventions are excluded from this definition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequacy of antibiotic therapy will be considered when prescription fulfils the local&#xD;
           guidelines: type of antibiotic + dose, and length of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION AND MONITORING. Monthly DHD will be calculated based on the dispensing data&#xD;
      of our electronic prescribing system of the Catalan Institute of Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To get information regarding secondary outcomes, patients who fulfil ICD-10 CM codes on the&#xD;
      last working day of every month will be selected by a cross-sectional analysis. On these&#xD;
      selected patients, information from electronic medical records (SAP logon® and eCAP) will be&#xD;
      obtained. Investigator will obtain the following variables: demographics, Charlson score,&#xD;
      type of infection, antibiotic prescribed, doses and length of antibiotic therapy,&#xD;
      re-attendance to the general practitioner, attendance to the emergency department, and&#xD;
      hospital admission. All the included patients will be followed up 30 days after the initial&#xD;
      primary care physician visit. To ensure completeness of data, a telephone call will be&#xD;
      allowed if any crucial data is missing in the electronic medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information regarding the burden of the intervention such as the number of telephone calls&#xD;
      received by the ID expert per month and the number of participants to biweekly meetings with&#xD;
      the ID will be also collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be recorded by the study monitor on a standardized data abstraction form by&#xD;
      using RedCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) hosted at IDIBELL, a secure web application&#xD;
      for building and managing online databases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE. The intervention area has a total of 18 primary care centres and a reference&#xD;
      population of 402 657 inhabitants. Six centres will be included, three in each study arm,&#xD;
      implying an approximate coverage of 37% of the referral population (147 644 inhabitants). The&#xD;
      consumption of antibiotics in 2017 was 8.94 DHD, and it's expected to reduce this consumption&#xD;
      by 10% in the intervention group. The number of 3 clusters per arm will allow rejecting the&#xD;
      null hypothesis of equal consumption with a power of 80%, assuming a moderate intra-cluster&#xD;
      correlation of 0.2, an intra-cluster variance of 4, and a mean difference of 1 DHD. Type I&#xD;
      error is set at 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. A descriptive analysis will be performed on the monthly consumption of&#xD;
      antibiotics expressed in DHD by the study group (control and intervention), period, and&#xD;
      cluster. The monthly consumption of antibiotics evolution will be represented on a graph by&#xD;
      months, and a smoothed curve will be estimated using locally weighted smoothing (LOESS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibiotic consumptions will be compared according to the study group using a time series&#xD;
      model. Where the dependent variable will be the monthly consumption of antibiotics expressed&#xD;
      in DHDs and the independent variable will be the study group. In the estimation of the model,&#xD;
      the seasonality, the trend, and the first and second-order lags of the series will be&#xD;
      analyzed. Also, the use of hierarchical models due to cluster design will be taken into&#xD;
      account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A descriptive analysis of the demographic and clinical profile of the patients surveyed will&#xD;
      be performed. A McNemar test will be used to compare, between the study groups, the&#xD;
      percentage of patients with an unnecessary prescription for the upper respiratory and urinary&#xD;
      tract, the percentage of patients with an adequate prescription according to the guidelines,&#xD;
      the percentage of patients who revisit general practitioner or emergency room at 30 days, and&#xD;
      the percentage of patients with hospital admission at 30 days. Also, log-binomial regression&#xD;
      models will be performed, to estimate the effect of the intervention in terms of risk on the&#xD;
      above-mentioned outcomes adjusting by patients' clinical profile. To estimate models it will&#xD;
      be accounted that patients are nested in primary care clusters, so a correction of the&#xD;
      standard errors is carried out through the variance-covariance matrix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management and statistical analysis will be carried out with the statistical package R&#xD;
      version 4.0.1 or higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LIMITATIONS. The study does not contemplate randomisation by prescribing physician, but by&#xD;
      conglomerates to avoid possible contamination effects at the prescribing physician and&#xD;
      patients in the same centre. As it is a cluster analysis, there could be differences in the&#xD;
      degree of prescription of doctors within the same centre and between the different centres.&#xD;
      In order to reduce this problem, the variability of prescribing intra-cluster and between&#xD;
      clusters has been calculated during the period 2017 in a group of primary care centres in the&#xD;
      intervention area, differences that have been taken into account for the calculation of the&#xD;
      sample. Design of the present study does not include a third group without any AMS&#xD;
      intervention due to department policies during 2019. However, to achieve the best result&#xD;
      interpretation, an historic of the antibiotic consumption in the participating centres will&#xD;
      act as a control group, and a baseline period with only an standard-AMS intervention will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons between all stages of the clinical trial will be performed to obtain more robust&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL ASPECTS. This research will be carried out under the standards of good clinical&#xD;
      practices following the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (Fortaleza, 2013), as well&#xD;
      as the current legislation applicable to this type of study. This study has been approved by&#xD;
      the Ethics Committee of Hospital Universitari de Bellvitge and the Foundation University&#xD;
      Institute for Primary Health Care Research Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol) who waived the need&#xD;
      to obtain informed consent since the intervention is mainly aimed at health-care&#xD;
      professionals (general practitioners) who will be previously informed of the objective and&#xD;
      other relevant aspects of the study (REF. PR277/19 - REF. 4R20/26).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data treatment of the included patients in the research project as well as that of&#xD;
      associated professionals (primary care physicians) will be carried out following the&#xD;
      established by the Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, and by Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the&#xD;
      European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 on Data Protection (RGPD). Based on&#xD;
      these regulations, the sponsor will guarantee the protection of the confidentiality of the&#xD;
      participants in the program, both patients and doctors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collection sheets will be identified with a code. The name of the doctor or patient&#xD;
      will not appear in any document, or any publication or communication of the study results.&#xD;
