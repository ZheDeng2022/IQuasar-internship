  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) removes tumors in the abdomen. HIPEC is heated chemotherapy that&#xD;
      washes the abdomen. CRS and HIPEC may help people with peritoneal carcinomatosis. These are&#xD;
      tumors that have spread to the lining of the abdomen from other cancers. Researchers think&#xD;
      they can improve results of CRS and HIPEC by choosing the chemotherapy drugs used in HIPEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if HIPEC after CRS can be improved, by testing different chemotherapy drugs, using a&#xD;
      model called the SMART (Sample Microenvironment of Resected Metastatic Tumor) System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 and older who have peritoneal carcinomatosis that cannot be fully removed&#xD;
      safely with surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computed tomography (CAT) scan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other imaging scans, as needed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrocardiogram (EKG)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor biopsy, if needed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laparoscopy. Small cuts will be made in the abdomen. A tube with a light and a camera will be&#xD;
      used to see their organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some screening tests will be repeated in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will enroll in NIH protocol #13C0176. This allows their tumor samples to be used&#xD;
      in future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have CRS. As many of their visible tumors will be removed as possible. They&#xD;
      will also have HIPEC. Two thin tubes will be put in their abdomen. They will get chemotherapy&#xD;
      through one tube. It will be drained out through the other tube. They will be in the hospital&#xD;
      for 7-21 days after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give tumor, blood, and fluid samples for research. They will complete&#xD;
      surveys about their health and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have follow-up visits over 5 years.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peritoneal carcinomatosis is uniformly fatal if untreated; improved outcomes are seen with&#xD;
      aggressive cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selection of chemotherapeutic agent for HIPEC is largely based on primary tumor histology&#xD;
      and provider preference as opposed to knowledge of the potential efficacy of a specific agent&#xD;
      for an individual patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIPEC is intended to target small or microscopic residual disease following complete&#xD;
      cytoreduction; however, the actual efficacy and additional benefit of HIPEC is in question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SMART System provides an ideal platform upon which to perfuse small peritoneal tumor&#xD;
      tissue implants and simulate HIPEC treatment ex vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue response to simulated ex vivo HIPEC treatment in the SMART System could inform&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic agent selection for subsequent cytoreduction and intra-operative in vivo&#xD;
      HIPEC treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the correlation between ex vivo simulated HIPEC in the SMART System and in vivo&#xD;
      HIPEC with respect to two measures of response to treatment: percent necrosis and Ki-67&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histologically confirmed peritoneal carcinomatosis from appendiceal, colorectal, ovarian, or&#xD;
      peritoneal mesothelioma histologies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Absence of extra-abdominal metastatic disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant deemed able to undergo complete cytoreduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age &gt;= 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase I study of cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and heated intraperitoneal&#xD;
      chemotherapy (HIPEC), with randomization to one of two accepted HIPEC treatment regimens as&#xD;
      determined by primary histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of cytoreduction, representative peritoneal tumor biopsies will be obtained&#xD;
      before and after intra-operative in vivo HIPEC treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor nodules harvested before intra-operative HIPEC will be placed in the SMART System,&#xD;
      exposed to simulated ex vivo HIPEC treatment, and then perfused, with subsequent assessment&#xD;
      of percent necrosis and Ki-67.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor nodules harvested after intra-operative HIPEC will be placed in the SMART System and&#xD;
      perfused, with subsequent assessment of percent necrosis and Ki-67.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The correlation of percent necrosis and Ki-67 assessment following simulated ex vivo HIPEC&#xD;
      and intra-operative in vivo HIPEC will be determined.&#xD;
