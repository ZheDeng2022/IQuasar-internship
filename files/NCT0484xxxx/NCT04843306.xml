  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer (PCa) is a devastating diagnosis with one of the lowest 5-year overall&#xD;
      survival rates of all malignancies. It is estimated that at least 45,000 Americans will die&#xD;
      of this disease in 2019, making it the third most common cause of oncologic death. Of the&#xD;
      patients that present without evidence of distant spread at the time of diagnosis, only a&#xD;
      minority of patients are able to proceed directly to surgical resection which remains the&#xD;
      mainstay treatment modality. Historical outcomes show that 30-40% of patients present with&#xD;
      borderline resectable (BRPC) or locally advanced (LAPC) disease due to tumor involvement of&#xD;
      local vasculature which prevents the patients from proceeding directly to surgery. In this&#xD;
      context, neoadjuvant therapy with radiation is often administered in an attempt to downstage&#xD;
      tumors prior to surgery, reduce the risk of a margin positive failure, and reduce the risk of&#xD;
      local recurrence after surgery. For patients who are truly technically or medically&#xD;
      unresectable, radiation can be offered with the intent of providing durable local control.&#xD;
      Indeed, a recent autopsy study showed that 30 % of patients who expire from PCa do so due to&#xD;
      the locally destructive spread from this disease, highlighting the imperative need for an&#xD;
      optimal local control strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delivering radiation to the pancreas is technically challenging and must be carefully&#xD;
      delivered given the risk of injury to radiosensitive organs at risk (OAR) in close proximity&#xD;
      such as the bowel and stomach. Compounding this difficulty is the variation in positioning of&#xD;
      the tumor and OARs due to respiratory induced motion and variation in bowel gas patterns. To&#xD;
      achieve daily accuracy in tumor localization, the investigators employ a comprehensive&#xD;
      strategy including strict immobilization, endoscopically placed fiducials, and daily on-board&#xD;
      cone beam CT (CBCT). Moreover, the investigators utilize active breathing control (ABC),&#xD;
      which requires patients to reproducibly perform multiple deep-inspiratory breath holds during&#xD;
      treatment. Radiation to the pancreas is delivered only when the patient is holding patient's&#xD;
      breath. During ABC, patients breathe through a snorkel-like device that records the volume of&#xD;
      air inhaled during each breath. In this apparatus is a valve that will cut off the flow of&#xD;
      air once the inhalation volume passes a certain threshold to ensure the same amount of volume&#xD;
      is taken in each time a breath hold is performed. Patients are asked to press on a button to&#xD;
      start the recording aspect of the device and then to take a deep breath hold. Once patients&#xD;
      reach the desired threshold for the inhaled volume, the valve prevents any further air from&#xD;
      being inhaled in, and the patient is asked to hold patient's breath for a duration of 20 - 30&#xD;
      seconds. The treatment team is not present in the room with the patient because of radiation&#xD;
      exposure so it requires the patient to follow a series of with the treatment team over an&#xD;
      intercom system. Patients are asked to do this without any visual biophysical feedback of&#xD;
      patient's waveforms, and to do this repeatedly for multiple times per treatment session. The&#xD;
      series of instructions can be challenging for many patients, potentially leading to prolonged&#xD;
      treatment times and additional breath holds especially in the early fractions before patients&#xD;
      become more familiar with the system. Furthermore, with only one planning session to become&#xD;
      acquainted with the ABC device and treatment instructions, patients have limited practical&#xD;
      time to gain mastery before returning for patient's actual treatment sessions. This is of&#xD;
      concern since patients who struggle with the ABC technique may have less consistent&#xD;
      reproducibility of daily tumor positioning which may lead to poorer radiation treatment&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
