  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A radical paradigm shift is taking place where technology, notably the explosion in easy&#xD;
      accessible direct-to-consumer genetic testing (e.g., 23andMe) and a high consumer interest in&#xD;
      genealogy (e.g., Ancestry.com), has hijacked gamete (eggs, sperm) and embryo donation&#xD;
      recipient parents' control over whether to inform their children about their donor&#xD;
      conception. Historically, the practice of gamete donation has been shrouded in secrecy,&#xD;
      however, the skyrocketing use of direct-to-consumer genetic testing means that at any point&#xD;
      in an adult life, an uninformed donor-conceived person can learn their DNA does not match&#xD;
      their presumed ancestry of their parents and family members, putting into question their&#xD;
      genetic relatedness to their parents and launching a spiraling sequence of negative health&#xD;
      consequences and trauma. Furthermore, the lack of one's knowledge about actual genetic&#xD;
      heritage in the age of precision medicine can be enormously detrimental to health and can&#xD;
      result in medical maltreatment, including death. To address this serious problem and in&#xD;
      accordance with International Patient Decision Aid Standards, we developed a digital,&#xD;
      tailored, multicomponent Tool to Empower ParentaL TeLling and Talking (i.e., TELL Tool). The&#xD;
      objective of this R34 study is to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary&#xD;
      effects of the TELL Tool intervention in a pilot randomized-controlled feasibility trial with&#xD;
      60 donor-recipient parents and 10 clinicians to determine intervention viability and inform a&#xD;
      larger, efficacy trial. An eBook with content about good parenting principles serves as the&#xD;
      attention control.&#xD;

      The feasibility trail will use a longitudinal, mixed-methods design that is guided by&#xD;
      International Patient Decision Aid Standards and NIH Guidelines for pilot studies. The study&#xD;
      design is necessary to achieve the objective of the study, which is to examine the&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of the TELL Tool intervention in a pilot randomized-controlled&#xD;
      feasibility trial to determine intervention viability and inform a larger, efficacy trial.&#xD;
      There are three Specific Aims that are: Aim 1 determine feasibility of the study procedures&#xD;
      (e.g., recruitment, retention) by pilot testing the TELL Tool using a 2-arm&#xD;
      randomized-controlled trial (RCT) with 60 donor-recipient parents using pre- to post-test&#xD;
      measures for disclosure intention, competence, and anxiety. (A pretesting of the measures&#xD;
      will be implemented with 8 to 12 donor-recipient parents, who are not participants of the&#xD;
      pilot RCT, prior to launching the RCT.); Aim 2 survey participating donor-recipient parents&#xD;
      at 2 additional time points (4 and 12 weeks/months 1 and 3) post-intervention/attention&#xD;
      control completion to obtain meaningful outcome data about actual parental disclosure to&#xD;
      their donor-conceived children; and Aim 3 refine the study tools (e.g., TELL Tool, eBook)&#xD;
      through post-intervention/attention control written evaluations with participating&#xD;
      donor-recipient parents and cognitive interviews with 10 donor-recipient parents, who are a&#xD;
      sub-sample of parents from our larger sample of parents, and 10 clinicians. The findings will&#xD;
      inform the final protocol for a larger, efficacy trial.&#xD;
