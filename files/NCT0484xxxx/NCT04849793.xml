      This randomized controlled study evaluates the effect of acupressure application on the&#xD;
      anxiety level of senior nursing students.The hypothesis of this study is that acupressure&#xD;
      reduces anxiety levels.&#xD;

      Methods: In the study, 52 senior nursing students were randomly assigned to the study and&#xD;
      control groups. The study group (n = 26) included Shen Men, the 7th acupuncture point (HT7)&#xD;
      of the heart meridian located between the ulna and pisiform bones on the radial side of the&#xD;
      flexor carpi ulnaris tendon, EX-HN3 (Yintang) located in the middle of the beginning of both&#xD;
      eyebrows and the thumb and the LI4 points located in the space between the index finger&#xD;
      (between the 1st and 2nd metacarpal bones of the hand, in the middle of the 2nd metacarpal&#xD;
      bone on the radial side) will be applied for an average of 10 minutes. No intervention will&#xD;
      be made to the control group (n = 26). In order to avoid ethical problems, both groups will&#xD;
      be given an informative training on acupressure and anxiety content at the end of the study.&#xD;
      The primary outcome of the study is the effect of acupressure on the state anxiety level of&#xD;
      senior nursing students. The secondary outcome of the study is the effect of acupressure on&#xD;
      trait anxiety level in senior nursing students. The results will be collected before the&#xD;
      acupressure and in the 4th week of the last intervention.&#xD;

    <masking_description>First of all, the names of all students will be listed alphabetically for the selection of 196 nursing students in the research population and 52 nursing students who will be the sample. Numbers between 1-196 will be written in front of each student in the ordered student list. 52 nursing students will be determined by randomization created in computer environment by an independent researcher who is not included in the study. A total of 52 students in the sample group determined by randomization will be separated according to the A and B groups created by the same statistician in computer environment.</masking_description>

    <description>Scores ranging from 20 to 80 points are obtained in the scale. In the total score obtained from the scale in scoring the scale, 0-19 points indicate the absence of anxiety, 20-39 points indicate mild anxiety, 40-59 points indicate moderate anxiety, and 60-79 points indicate severe anxiety level. Higher state anxiety scores indicate that anxiety level is also high</description>

    <description>Before the intervention, the students will be asked to rub the area around the area to be pressed for 20-30 seconds with their palms. With the gentle rubbing of the surrounding tissue, the tension and tissue sensitivity in the area of warming, relaxing and preparatory will be reduced and the tissue will be relieved. After rubbing, each individual's pain threshold level will be taken as a basis in order not to cause tissue damage. The students will be asked to press the designated point manually with their thumb, index or middle finger for 5 seconds with a depth of 1-1.5 cm, rest for 2 seconds and continue the practice for 2 minutes. In the study group, an average of 13 minutes will be applied to HT7, LI4 and EX-HN3 points (five points in total) for two minutes each. The nursing students participating in the research will be given a total of 12 acupressure intervention remotely, three days a week, for four weeks, at least two hours after dinner and when they are calmest.</description>
