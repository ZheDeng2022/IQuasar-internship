    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effects of ibrutinib and rituximab with or without venetoclax&#xD;
      in treating patients with previously untreated Waldenstrom's&#xD;
      macroglobulinemia/lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells&#xD;
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      that may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Venetoclax may stop&#xD;
      the growth of cancer cells by blocking Bcl-2, a protein needed for cancer cell survival.&#xD;
      Giving venetoclax with ibrutinib and rituximab with may work better in treating patients with&#xD;
      previously untreated Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia than ibrutinib and rituximab alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the rate of complete response (CR) in previously untreated participants with&#xD;
      Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM)/lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) who are treated upfront&#xD;
      with ibrutinib, rituximab and venetoclax (IRV) versus (vs.) ibrutinib and rituximab (IR)&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare overall response rates (ORR) in WM participants treated upfront with IRV vs.&#xD;
      those treated with IR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare progression free survival (PFS), time to next treatment, duration of response&#xD;
      in WM participants treated upfront with IRV vs. those treated with IR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To compare the rate of very good partial response (VGPR) or better in WM participants&#xD;
      treated upfront with IRV vs. those treated with IR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the safety of the IRV regimen as compared to IR regimen in participants with&#xD;
      WM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate the time to CR in WM participants treated upfront with IRV and those treated&#xD;
      with IR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To evaluate the ORR in participants who progress on treatment with IR and are crossed&#xD;
      over to treatment with IRV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To compare overall survival (OS) in WM participants treated upfront with IRV vs. those&#xD;
      treated with IR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BANK OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To bank specimens for future correlative studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 of cycles 1-24 and&#xD;
      rituximab intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of cycles 1 and 5. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 28 days for up to 24 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Patients with progressive disease during Arm I may receive ibrutinib, rituximab,&#xD;
      and venetoclax as in Arm II for up to an additional 24 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive ibrutinib PO QD on days 1-28 of cycles 1-24, rituximab IV on days 1,&#xD;
      8, 15, and 22 of cycles 1 and 5, and venetoclax PO QD on days 1-28 of cycles 2-24. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 28 days for up to 24 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and&#xD;
      then every 6 months for up to 5 years.&#xD;

             parasitic, or other infection (excluding fungal infections of nail beds) at study&#xD;
             enrollment, or any major episode of infection requiring treatment with IV antibiotics&#xD;

             required if clinically indicated or if the participant has a history of HCV&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must not consume grapefruit, Seville oranges or starfruit within 3 days&#xD;
             prior to the first dose of venetoclax&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must not be pregnant or nursing because venetoclax has not been studied&#xD;
             in pregnant or nursing women and the mechanism of action is expected to cause fetal&#xD;
             harm. A woman is considered to be of &quot;reproductive potential&quot; if she has had menses at&#xD;
             any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months. In addition to routine contraceptive&#xD;
             methods, &quot;effective contraception&quot; e.g., implants, injectables, combined oral&#xD;
             contraceptives, some intrauterine devices [IUDs], complete abstinence, or sterilized&#xD;
             partner) and a barrier method (e.g., condom, cervical ring, sponge, etc.). This also&#xD;
             includes heterosexual celibacy and surgery intended to prevent pregnancy (or with a&#xD;
             side-effect of pregnancy prevention) defined as a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy&#xD;
             or bilateral tubal ligation. However, if at any point a previously celibate&#xD;
             participant chooses to become heterosexually active during the time period for use of&#xD;
             contraceptive measures outlined in the protocol, he/she is responsible for beginning&#xD;
             contraceptive measures throughout the study and for at least 30 days after competition&#xD;
             of therapy&#xD;
