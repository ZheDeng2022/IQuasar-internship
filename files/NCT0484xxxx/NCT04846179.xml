    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is defined as progressive neuropathy of the optic nerve. It is an important cause of&#xD;
      irreversible blindness worldwide. Lowering the intraocular pressure is the only proven&#xD;
      treatment for this neurodegenerative disease. However, there is ongoing research looking at&#xD;
      another modifiable risk factor that affects the development and progression of this disease.&#xD;
      Ginkgo biloba (Ginkgoacease) is a tree species that has been used in traditional medicine for&#xD;
      several hundred years to treat various diseases include improving vascular perfusion. We&#xD;
      propose a study examining the effect of Ginkgo biloba extract supplementation on ocular&#xD;
      perfusion using optical coherence tomography angiography.&#xD;

      Glaucoma is defined as progressive neuropathy of the optic nerve. It is an important cause of&#xD;
      irreversible blindness worldwide. Lowering the intraocular pressure is the only proven&#xD;
      treatment for this neurodegenerative disease. However, there is ongoing research looking at&#xD;
      another modifiable risk factor that affects the development and progression of this disease.&#xD;
      There is growing evidence that vascular dysfunction plays a role in the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      glaucoma. Low ocular perfusion pressure (OPP), which is expressed as the difference between&#xD;
      mean arterial pressure and intraocular pressure (IOP), has been hypothesized to lead to&#xD;
      glaucomatous optic neuropathy via ischemic damage to the optic nerve. The Barbados Eye Study&#xD;
      showed that reduced OPP at baseline was associated with a three-fold increased risk of&#xD;
      glaucoma development. Evidence has also shown that optic nerve hypoperfusion may contribute&#xD;
      to the progression of glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ginkgo biloba (Ginkgoacease) is a tree species that has been used in traditional medicine for&#xD;
      several hundred years to treat various diseases. There have been recent studies that have&#xD;
      examined its medicinal properties in treating age-related cognitive disease and neuronal&#xD;
      degeneration resulting from ischaemic events. Studies examining systemic vascular ischemic&#xD;
      diseases have shown a beneficial effect of ginkgo Biloba extract (GBE) on systemic arterial&#xD;
      occlusive diseases. There is also preliminary research examining the effect GBE has on optic&#xD;
      nerve head perfusion in patients with glaucoma. There is a study that examined the effects of&#xD;
      antioxidants including GBE on ocular blood flow in patients with glaucoma using doppler&#xD;
      ultrasound. When compared with patients receiving placebo, patients after antioxidant therapy&#xD;
      containing GBE were shown to have increased peak systolic and/or end-diastolic blood&#xD;
      velocities in all retrobulbar blood vessels, reduced vascular resistance in the central&#xD;
      retinal and nasal short posterior ciliary arteries, increased superior and inferior temporal&#xD;
      retinal capillary mean blood flow, an increased ratio of active to nonactive retinal&#xD;
      capillaries. In the area of optic nerve head perfusion studies, fluorescein angiography has&#xD;
      also been used in investigating alteration in blood flow in glaucomatous versus normal eyes.&#xD;
      However, utility in clinical practice is limited by the qualitative nature of the test and&#xD;
      the risk for adverse events. While color Doppler ultrasound is greatly limited in terms of&#xD;
      resolution and can be openly used to examine large vessels of the eye. New development in&#xD;
      ocular imaging has shown that OCTA can provide reproducible and quantifiable information&#xD;
      about the microvasculature of the optic nerve and peripapillary retina in patients with&#xD;
      glaucoma and can do so in a rapid and non-invasive manner avoiding some of the limitations on&#xD;
      doppler ultrasound and fluorescein angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GBE Egb761 is a standardized GBE that's used in most published research on the effect of&#xD;
      ginkgo Biloba. It is a standardized GBE used in evidence-based medicine and clinical&#xD;
      investigations ensuring clinical standardization and a safe manufacturing process. It has&#xD;
      much of the toxic ginkgolic acid removed leaving behind the active components of flavonoid&#xD;
      glycosides and terpene lactones. In general, GBE is well tolerated with a low side effect&#xD;
      profile. Several systematic reviews on research using GBE (daily dose of up to 600 mg) report&#xD;
      no statistical difference in side effects with GBE compared with placebo. There have been&#xD;
      some concerns regarding the bleeding risk while on ginkgo supplementation. However,&#xD;
      randomized placebo-controlled studies in healthy volunteers have not shown any changes in&#xD;
      bleeding time, coagulation parameters, or platelet function. Multiple studies have reported&#xD;
      minimal adverse effects (AEs) of GBE within a specific prescribed dosage range. Overall, GBE&#xD;
      continues to be a well-tolerated supplement with a low side effect profile. Systematic&#xD;
      reviews of the Cochrane databases, PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Google Scholar, report no&#xD;
      statistically significant difference in AEs between 80 and 600 mg of GBE and placebo.&#xD;
