      Aim:There is still not enough data to determine methylprednisolone treatment timing, dosage,&#xD;
      duration of use and indication in Covid 19 pneumonia. The aim of this study is to examine the&#xD;
      relationship between drug dose and hospitalisation time and mortality rates in patients with&#xD;
      pre-diagnosis of severe covid pneumonia and systemic methylprednisolone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: The demographic data, symptom durations, thorax CT findings,&#xD;
      methylprednisolone dose and duration of treatment, hospitalisation times, intensive care&#xD;
      hospitalizations of the patients who were initiated and hospitalized in the emergency&#xD;
      department will be retrospectively recorded. Finally, the fate of the patients (such as&#xD;
      discharge, referral, death) will be recorded.Statistical analysis will be conducted using the&#xD;
      Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) (IBM Corp. Released 2015. IBM SPSS Statistics&#xD;
      for Windows, Version 21.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.) program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Covid 19 infection can progress with widespread inflammation and cytokine storm. Induced&#xD;
      excessive cytokine release is associated with tissue damage in the lung. Severe inflammatory&#xD;
      / oxidative stress response and severe lung injury secondary to ARDS may develop. Therefore,&#xD;
      suppressing the proinflammatory response has a very important place in treatment.&#xD;
      Methylprednisolone is classically an immune response suppressor, powerful anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      drug and is used in the treatment of covid 19 severe infection. However, there is still not&#xD;
      enough data to determine the treatment timing, dosage, duration of use and indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between drug dose and hospitalisation&#xD;
      time and mortality rates in patients with pre-diagnosis of severe covid pneumonia and&#xD;
      systemic methylprednisolone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: The demographic data, symptom durations, thorax CT findings,&#xD;
      methylprednisolone dose and duration of treatment, hospitalisation times, intensive care&#xD;
      hospitalisations of the patients who were initiated and hospitalized in the emergency&#xD;
      department will be retrospectively recorded. Finally, the fate of the patients (such as&#xD;
      discharge, referral, death) will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the treatment of severe Covid 19 pneumonia, methylprednisolone treatment is used in&#xD;
      addition to antiviral treatment. However, there are insufficient data on the time to start&#xD;
      this treatment, drug dose and duration of use in daily routine. With the results of our&#xD;
      study, we hope that we can contribute to the dose, duration and timing of methylprednisolone&#xD;
      use in the treatment of Covid 19 pneumonia.&#xD;
