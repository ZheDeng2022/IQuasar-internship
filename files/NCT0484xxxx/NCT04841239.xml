    <textblock>
      Infections due to protozoa of the genus Leishmania are a major worldwide skin problem, with&#xD;
      high endemicity in developing countries including Pakistan. As far as concern for the&#xD;
      treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), there is no single therapeutic agent that has&#xD;
      proved a satisfactory efficacy and safety. Therefore, the objective of this research study&#xD;
      was to develop an alternative therapeutic approach for the treatment of CL. In the current&#xD;
      research protocol, two herbal topical formulations (Gyburene and Thuscare) were prepared&#xD;
      containing to contain 5% Casuarina equisetifolia L. and Thespesia populnea L. plant extract&#xD;
      and evaluate their leishmanicidal potential in pre-clinical and randomized clinical trials&#xD;
      studies. Preclinical studies were performed on BALB/c mice after the development of a lesion&#xD;
      on the dermis caused by the Leishmania (L.) major parasite. Six weeks randomized, single&#xD;
      single-blind placebo controlled study was also conducted on seventy eight L. major infected&#xD;
      patients divided into three groups i.e. treated, reference and placebo with the 1:1 ratios.&#xD;

      STUDY PROTOCOL&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1. Introduction Leishmaniasis is a major neglected health problem frequently found in&#xD;
      tropical and subtropical regions with the prevalence rate of 1.5 million per year globally.&#xD;
      The disease is caused by protozoan parasite from genus Leishmania. Transmission occurred by&#xD;
      sand fly of genus Phlebotomus in the (Old World) and Lutzomyia (New World). Cutaneous&#xD;
      leishmaniasis is restricted to skin and around 185 million people at risk in 61 countries.&#xD;
      Now it is endemic in Pakistan (different regions) and diffuses fastly, particularly in the&#xD;
      refugee camps main causative agent found is L. major followed by L. tropica. Vigilant&#xD;
      literature review revealed that besides the four provinces of Pakistan increased incidences&#xD;
      of CL were found in Balochistan which is largest province (in area) followed by NWFP. In&#xD;
      Sindh province (Dadu, Jacobabad, Larkana and Karachi) are commonly reported for cases while&#xD;
      in Punjab (Multan and Dera Ghazi Khan) are mainly reported for the occurrence of disease.&#xD;
      Diagnosis of this diseases is done by clinical picture usually dry lesions are caused by L.&#xD;
      tropica while moist and early ulcerative lesions are caused by L. major, such lesions take&#xD;
      months to years for healing eventually heal by own but satellite lesions and bacterial and&#xD;
      fungal infections results in delayed and complicated healing process, but in non-endemic&#xD;
      areas it is difficult to diagnose because of unclear form, along with this secondary&#xD;
      infections, delay treatment as well as mistreatment sometimes can also cause changes in&#xD;
      clinical picture. In such situations examination of smear from lesion is the diagnostic tool&#xD;
      along with culture and histopathological examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2. Clinical trials against CL Methanolic bark extract of Casuarina equisetifolia L. showed&#xD;
      good antileishmanial potential against L.major using in vitro analysis which directed us&#xD;
      towards an innovative therapeutic concept for development of new herbal formulations against&#xD;
      leishmaniasis through accelerated wound closures in clinical trials on human contestants.&#xD;
      Ulcerative CL is because of defective wound healing depending on this hypothesis current&#xD;
      study is planned to explored clinical efficacy of new protocol Gyburene 5% cream as&#xD;
      anti-parasitic agent followed by Thuscare 5% ointment for speed up wounds closure. The&#xD;
      primary objective of this study is to evaluate anti leishmanial outcome of Gyburene 5% cream&#xD;
      at wound closure and after six months while secondary objective is to evaluate that incessant&#xD;
      wound care along with anti-parasitic agent can results in valuable enhancement in treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3. Sample population and study design: This is a single-blind, randomized study. Seventy&#xD;
      patients with confirmed with cutaneous leishmaniasis were recruited in the study.&#xD;
      Participants were randomly allocated into two groups. Pilot group (did not receive any&#xD;
      medication before) and resistant group (who already received medication either parental or&#xD;
      topical). During trials 20 participants were dropped as a result of lack of follow up&#xD;
      specially the affected people coming from rural areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3.1. Ethical consideration: The research protocol was approved by ethical committee of the&#xD;
      Board of Advanced Studies and Research University of Karachi Vide Resol No. 16. Informed&#xD;
      consents forms were taken from each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3.2. Patient Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history of each patient (age, sex, co-morbidities, wound condition, site and size of&#xD;
      lesion with Giemsa smear test report) was taken prior to treatment protocol on clinical&#xD;
      Performa specially designed for this study and consisted of two parts, first for personnel&#xD;
      information and second for medical history. Lesion size was calculated using Vernier caliper&#xD;
      in two dimensions and each participant advised for weekly follow up till end of therapy,&#xD;
      portrait photograph were taken before, throughout and after therapy using digital camera for&#xD;
      assessment of healing percentage. Cured patients follow up was done for further six months to&#xD;
      ensure no set back has been happened. Presence or absence of parasite was confirmed by smear&#xD;
      test while healed area was calculated by percentage of healing by following formula (Baie and&#xD;
      Sheikh, 2000):&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3.2.1. Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients who met the histological criteria for presence of parasite&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Age of older than 4 years and both gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Lesions are less than 5 in number in each patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Size of lesion is less than 5cm2&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Participants who had stopped therapy greater than 4 weeks earlier and the lesions were&#xD;
           not improving.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Duration of disease for patients under trial was six months (acute) and more than one&#xD;
           year (chronic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3.2.2. Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients who had taken any immuosuppressive drugs or anti leishmanial drugs in last&#xD;
           month.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pregnant women and lactating mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Contestants with complications of renal, hepatic and pulmonary disease, Immune-o-&#xD;
           compromised patients such as (HIV).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients suffering from conditions like malaria, tuberculosis and treatment regimen is&#xD;
           going on for such infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3.3. Study treatment Prior to the initiate treatment protocol toxicological evaluation of&#xD;
      herbal extracts was also done to ensure the safety of topical herbal pharmaceutical&#xD;
      preparations. In case of more than one lesion any one targeted for biopsies although all&#xD;
      received same treatment. Both groups of patient were treated with topical herbal formulations&#xD;
      Gyburene 5% cream (for cure of CL) in morning and evening and Thuscare 5% ointment (for rapid&#xD;
      wound healing and cure of super infections) only at night in two different directions at the&#xD;
      angle of 90º to each other by leaving lesion uncovered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before application of second formulation all contestant were advised to wash the lesion with&#xD;
      normal saline. Weekly follow up was done till completion of the therapy in order to ensure&#xD;
      the entire cure such as for negative smear skin test amastigotes in Giemsa strain and&#xD;
      complete healing with re-epithelialization of the lesion. Each formulation was dispensed in&#xD;
      10 g container (separately) enough for one week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4. Statistical Analysis T-test used for comparison rate of healing between two groups while&#xD;
      Kaplan Meier test between pilot and resistant group while Kaplan Meier test used to calculate&#xD;
      healed area per week for both resistant and pilot group at P&lt;0.05 using SPSS version 21.&#xD;
