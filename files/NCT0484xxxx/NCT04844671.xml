      Robotic surgery for common surgical procedures is on the rise despite limited evidence to&#xD;
      support its clinical benefit. We intend to to map and characterize the prevalence of the&#xD;
      patients'expectation that robotic surgery might be superior to open or laparoscopic&#xD;
      procedures and to identify the sociodemographic, clinical and organisational factors&#xD;
      associated with this expectation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the progress of modern medicine, minimally invasive surgical technology has become the&#xD;
      main theme in the field of contemporary surgery. As a rising star, the Da Vinci robotic&#xD;
      surgery system provides surgeons with a more comprehensive surgical vision, more flexible&#xD;
      instrument control, finer anatomy, and more natural comfort compared to open surgery and&#xD;
      laparoscopic surgery. However, due to the lack of long-term theoretical basis, the evidence&#xD;
      to support its clinical benefits is limited, and its application is limited by related&#xD;
      postoperative complications and high operation-related costs. At present, the number of Da&#xD;
      Vinci robotic surgery is steadily increasing around the world, but what are the expectations&#xD;
      of patients that robotic surgery may be better than open or laparoscopic surgery? It is also&#xD;
      unclear what reasons are related to this established expectation. Therefore, we intend to map&#xD;
      and characterize the prevalence of the patients' expectation that robotic surgery might be&#xD;
      superior to open or laparoscopic procedures and to identify the sociodemographic, clinical&#xD;
      and organisational factors associated with this expectation.&#xD;

China new rural cooperative medical system; 2. The medical insurance for urban residents; 3. The medical insurance for urban workers; 4. Commercial insurance. According to China's national income level, our survey design is divided into three stages: personal annual income below 50,000 RMB, 50,000-100,000 RMB, and more than 100,000 RMB.</description>
