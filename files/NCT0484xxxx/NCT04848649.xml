      Background Psoriasis is a common disease which is a source of major distress for patients and&#xD;
      costs for the society. Treatments are effective but temporary and relapses occur,&#xD;
      preferentially at sites previously involved. Locally, tissue resident memory T cells (TRM)&#xD;
      cells prone to produce pathogenic cytokines accumulate in the outer layers of the resolved&#xD;
      skin of psoriasis patients under treatment, and can trigger strong inflammatory responses&#xD;
      upon reactivation, thus starting the cascade of the relapse. We have recently shown that the&#xD;
      skin transcriptional responses after TRM cell activation in healed skin biopsies of patients&#xD;
      could predict the time until the disease relapse. How to modify the local pool of TRM cells&#xD;
      in the human skin is not known, but several factors leading to the establishment and the&#xD;
      persistence of the TRM cells in the skin are suggested. First, the skin microbiota has&#xD;
      emerged as a potent actor of the skin immunity, with the capacity to shape the pool of skin T&#xD;
      cells in mice. Second, after TRM cells are settled in the skin, their lipid intake will&#xD;
      impact their local survival. Last, in addition to these local factors, the gut subclinical&#xD;
      inflammation that lead to bacterial translocation can trigger a more global state of&#xD;
      inflammation in the body and could drive the local survival of the TRM cells in the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims Our first aim in this project is to validate a tool to predict psoriasis relapse upon&#xD;
      treatment withdrawal in a cohort of patients treated with systemic drugs- the STOPso cohort&#xD;
      (Shortening Treatments Of Psoriasis). We will correlate the skin reaction to local TRM&#xD;
      activation in resolved lesions to the time before relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In parallel, we will characterize several factors likely to participate to the establishment,&#xD;
      function and survival of the TRM cells in the skin. We will decipher the skin microbiota and&#xD;
      mycobiota; the lipid composition of the outer layer of the skin; the presence of&#xD;
      lipopolysaccharide in the blood, in order to better understand what factors should be&#xD;
      targeted to modify the skin populations of TRM cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Patients will be recruited through the Dermatology department of the university&#xD;
      hospital of Besançon. We will use skin biopsies from resolved lesions to perform the&#xD;
      characterization of the skin responses at the transcriptional level after local TRM&#xD;
      activation with OKT-3 antibody compared to control. RNA will be analyzed with Nanostring&#xD;
      technologies. For the microbiota analysis, we will use wet swabs and later DNA sequencing.&#xD;
      The lipid composition and the circulating LPS will be analyzed after tape stripping, through&#xD;
      the LabEx LipSTIC lipidomic platform of the region Bourgogne Franche-Comté. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed up at Month 1, Month 6, Month 12 and Month 18 and at time of relapse if it occurs in&#xD;
      between those intervals. Data about the disease activity (PASI, quality of life scores) and&#xD;
      inter-current events will be registered at each time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results and Perspectives The final aim of this project is to validate a tool&#xD;
      available to clinicians to guide them in their decision to withdraw an efficient treatment in&#xD;
      psoriasis, based on the skin reactivity to the resident T cells left locally after resolution&#xD;
      of the inflammation. This would help reduce treatment length, and thus toxicities and costs&#xD;
      to the health care systems. To open future perspectives, we also want to better understand&#xD;
      the reasons why TRM populations tend to be retained in the skin, in order to develop&#xD;
      remodeling strategies of the skin TRM populations.&#xD;
