    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will be treated with the combination of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab. A&#xD;
      cycle equals 21 days and therapy will continue until radiographic progression, intolerable&#xD;
      toxicity, or patient/physician wishes to discontinue protocol therapy. A maximum of 35 cycles&#xD;
      may be administered. On Day 1, when both pembrolizumab and lenvatinib are administered,&#xD;
      patients should take the lenvatinib per their normal routine.&#xD;

             must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not require&#xD;
             corticosteroids, and not have had radiation pneumonitis. A 1-week washout is permitted&#xD;
             for palliative radiation (≤ 2 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-CNS disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational agent&#xD;
             or has used an investigational device within 3 weeks prior to the first dose of study&#xD;
             treatment. NOTE: Participants who have entered the follow-up phase of an&#xD;
             investigational study may participate as long as it has been 3 weeks after the last&#xD;
             dose of the previous investigational agent.&#xD;
&#xD;

          8. Presence of non-healing wounds after surgical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with&#xD;
             previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically&#xD;
             stable, i.e. without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging&#xD;
             (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically&#xD;
             stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to&#xD;
             first dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug. Examples&#xD;
             of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps,&#xD;
             rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus&#xD;
             Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection&#xD;
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza&#xD;
             vaccines (eg, FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Significant cardiovascular impairment: history of congestive heart failure greater&#xD;
             than New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II, unstable angina, myocardial&#xD;

             arrhythmia requiring medical treatment at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Bleeding or thrombotic disorders or subjects at risk for severe hemorrhage. The degree&#xD;
             of tumor invasion/infiltration of major blood vessels (e.g. carotid artery) should be&#xD;
             considered because of the potential risk of severe hemorrhage associated with tumor&#xD;
             shrinkage/necrosis following lenvatinib therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subjects having &gt; 1+ proteinuria on urine dipstick testing unless a 24-hour urine&#xD;
             collection for quantitative assessment indicates that the urine protein is &lt;1 g/24&#xD;
             hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (in&#xD;
             dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of&#xD;
             immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Severe hypersensitivity (≥ Grade 3) to pembrolizumab and/or any of its excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Severe hypersensitivity (≥ Grade 3) to lenvatinib and/or any of its excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years&#xD;
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment. Replacement steroids for adrenal insufficiency or daily&#xD;
             dose equivalent of 10 mg prednisone are allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. History of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current&#xD;
             pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Active infection requiring systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment&#xD;
             within the past 3 years. NOTE: Participants with basal cell carcinoma of the skin,&#xD;
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ (e.g. breast carcinoma,&#xD;
             cervical cancer in situ) that have undergone potentially curative therapy are not&#xD;
             excluded. Subjects with other solid tumors treated curatively and without evidence of&#xD;
             recurrence for at least 2 years prior to enrollment may be eligible for study after&#xD;
             discussion with the sponsor-investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). NOTE: HIV testing is not required&#xD;
             unless mandated by a local health authority.&#xD;

         22. Known history of Hepatitis B (defined as Hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] reactive)&#xD;
             or known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV RNA [qualitative] is detected)&#xD;
             infection. NOTE: Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C testing is not required unless clinical&#xD;
             history indicates that this is likely.&#xD;
