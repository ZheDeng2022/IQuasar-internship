  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to the corona pandemia and the consecutive reduction of teaching students face to face&#xD;
      the imparting of medical skills is limited. Video sequences may be an adequate alternative to&#xD;
      educate selected practical skills. So, the investigators intend to explore this aspect as a&#xD;
      first concerning two basic medical skills: Donati suture and intraosseous venous access.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit last year medical students and randomise them into two groups:&#xD;
      Group A and Group B. Both groups will be video recorded during the performance of the two&#xD;
      skills on simulators (i.s. Donati suture and intraosseous venous access) (timepoint: T0).&#xD;
      Then group A will watch a standardised video about the skills, and group B will do&#xD;
      self-study. Then, both groups will be again video recorded during the performance of the two&#xD;
      skills on simulators (timepoint: T1). After 1 week group B will watch the same standardised&#xD;
      video about the skills, and group A will do self-study. Then both groups will be again video&#xD;
      recorded during the performance of the two skills on simulators (timepoint: T2).&#xD;
