  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with planned crossover&#xD;
      to the intervention arm after 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting patients with CLL who have had at least one NMSC diagnosed in the past year will&#xD;
      be randomized to receive either oral nicotinamide 500 mg twice daily (BID) for 1 year or oral&#xD;
      placebo 1 tablet twice daily for 1 year. Patients will be stratified according to CLL therapy&#xD;
      and the number of prior NMSC. At the end of 1 year, patients will undergo dermatologic&#xD;
      examination and the number of new NMSC will be quantified. The number of patients who develop&#xD;
      new NMSC in each arm will be documented. At this time, patients will be unblinded and all&#xD;
      patients will receive Nicotinamide 500 mg BID for an additional year. At the end of this&#xD;
      second year, patients will again undergo dermatologic examination, and the number of new NMSC&#xD;
      will be quantified. The number of patients who develop NMSC will be documented. Skin biopsies&#xD;
      will be taken for correlative studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment will be split into two parts separated by an interim analysis. Part 1 will accrue&#xD;
      40 patients: 20 to each arm. After 40 patients have completed their 12 month visit an interim&#xD;
      futility analysis will be conducted prior to recruiting more patients. The study will stop if&#xD;
      the difference in the number of patients with NMSC between control and treatment arms is 0 or&#xD;
      less (i.e., absolutely no evidence that the treatment is better than control). If the trial&#xD;
      is not stopped, the investigators will proceed with Part 2 and recruit 46 more patients.&#xD;
