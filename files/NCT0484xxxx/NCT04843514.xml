  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asparaginase is a cornerstone in the treatment of ALL. In most contemporary protocols like in&#xD;
      NOPHO ALL2008 prolonged asparaginase treatment has been implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publish data from NOPHO ALL2008 show sufficient treatment of the majority of patients&#xD;
      (analysing trough levels of asparaginase after 2 weeks) but 13% of the patients experience an&#xD;
      allergic reaction to this foreign protein (85% of them after the 2nd or 3rd dose) and they&#xD;
      have no enzyme activity even before the reaction, meaning that they don't benefit from the&#xD;
      treatment at all. In addition 4-5% of the patients have no enzyme activity through the whole&#xD;
      treatment without hypersensitivity symptoms. So in reality approximately 20% of the patients&#xD;
      don't receive any asparaginase treatment. Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) of asparaginase&#xD;
      has been established in Aarhus, Denmark, under the leadership of Birgitte Klug Albertsen&#xD;
      (BKA). From February 2017 the centers have been invited to send samples (extended sampling)&#xD;
      in order to gain more knowledge about the pharmacokinetics, to identify patients without&#xD;
      activity and to establish the logistics for TDM of asparaginase, which will be mandatory in&#xD;
      the next protocol ALLTogether, presumably opening in 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From February 2016 an extended sampling for enzyme activity measurements was started and will&#xD;
      continue until NOPHO ALL2008 closes. These samples will make it possible to do more in depth&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic studies as well as identify the optimal sampling time points for identifying&#xD;
      no-activity patients in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A database is being developed for TDM in ALLTogether, but it will also include all the&#xD;
      asparaginase measurements in ALL2008.&#xD;
