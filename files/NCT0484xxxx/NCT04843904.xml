  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is trying to determine which patients with newly diagnosed or&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL),&#xD;
      as grouped by their risk for tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), are able to safely tolerate an&#xD;
      accelerated, daily venetoclax dose ramp-up rather than the standard approved schedule (5-week&#xD;
      dose ramp-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The name of the study drug involved in this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Venetoclax&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following drugs may also be included in some participants treatment regimen:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obinutuzumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rituximab&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label phase Ib study of an accelerated venetoclax ramp-up in patients with&#xD;
      CLL/SLL in either the front-line or relapsed/refractory setting. This clinical trial is&#xD;
      testing a new dosing schedule of a drug that is normally dosed in a different fashion. As&#xD;
      such, venetoclax is considered an investigational drug when given in this new schedule.&#xD;
      &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA) has approved venetoclax as a treatment option for CLL or SLL but the approval is based&#xD;
      on a different schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venetoclax is an oral drug inhibitor of BCL-2, a protein that regulates the death of cells in&#xD;
      the body. It has been FDA approved with or without rituximab for the treatment of adult&#xD;
      patients with CLL/SLL who have received at least one prior therapy, with obinutuzumab for&#xD;
      frontline therapy of CLL/SLL, as well in combination with azacitabine, decitabine, or&#xD;
      low-dose cytarabine for the treatment of adults with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia&#xD;
      (AML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venetoclax is typically started at a low dose and increased on a weekly basis, over 5 weeks,&#xD;
      to the desired dose for patients with CLL/SLL.This study is trying to determine if patients&#xD;
      can safely increase the venetoclax dose in the hospital on a daily basis, over 5 days rather&#xD;
      than weekly, and which patients, grouped by their risk for TLS, with newly diagnosed or&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL, are able to safely tolerate this accelerated, daily venetoclax&#xD;
      dose ramp-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be actively followed for approximately 3 months. Following completion&#xD;
      of the active study period, participants will be encouraged to return for a response&#xD;
      evaluation. Following this, patients will enter a long-term follow up period where they will&#xD;
      be observed for a maximum of 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 40 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be separated into two cohorts: Cohort A: Patients at low risk for TLS. Cohort B: Patients with both median and high risk for TLS.&#xD;
Five (5) participants from cohort A will be initially enrolled, if these first 5 participants tolerate the accelerated ramp-up, cohorts A and B will enroll simultaneously.&#xD;
All participants will be hospitalized and receive venetoclax daily with accelerated dose increases over 5 days to reach full dose. After reaching full dose, participants will be discharged and continue daily venetoclax at home.&#xD;
Per doctor assessment, some participants may also receive rituximab or obinutuzumab as part of the treatment regimen with venetoclax.&#xD;
Rituximab: Given every 28 days starting on the second study cycle and continuing for up to 6 cycles as per standard of care.&#xD;
Obinutuzumab: Days 1, 2, 8, and 15 of cycle 1 and once every 28 days there after for up to 6 cycles as per standard of care.</description>
