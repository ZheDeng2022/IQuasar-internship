      Individuals use substance for mood-alerting purposes. Substance can be alcohol, cannabis,&#xD;

      they are related to unsafe sex and thereby chances are more to contracting HIV infection in&#xD;
      two ways. Firstly, people inject drugs and shares needle; secondly, drugs impair judgment&#xD;
      that leads to unprotected sex with infected partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship between drug use and HIV disease progression may be mediated by several&#xD;

      Study of substance abuse among treatment naïve HIV patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Individuals use substance for mood-alerting purposes. Substance can be alcohol,&#xD;
      cannabis, nicotine, cocaine and methamphetamine. Substance addiction/abuse is excessive use&#xD;
      of a drug that is detrimental to self and society . These drugs are linked to risky sex&#xD;
      behavior and they are related to unsafe sex and thereby chances are more to contracting HIV&#xD;
      infection in two ways. Firstly, people inject drugs and shares needle; secondly, drugs impair&#xD;
      judgment that leads to unprotected sex with infected partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship between drug use and HIV disease progression may be mediated by several&#xD;
      factors, including immunologic and virologic conditions affecting host susceptibility,&#xD;
      underlying comorbidities among drug users, use of antiretroviral therapy, and viral strain,&#xD;
      as well as pharmacodynamic aspects of drug use, such as the pattern and type of drug&#xD;
      administration and the route of administration. Laboratory based studies show exacerbation of&#xD;
      HIV progression among patient with drug addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim and objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study of prevalence of substance abuse among anti-retroviral treatment naïve patients&#xD;
           positive for HIV antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare opportunistic infections prevalent in patients positive for HIV antibodies&#xD;
           with substance addiction and without substance addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare CD4+ T cell counts at the first visit to ART entre and after six months in&#xD;
           patients positive for HIV antibodies with substance addiction and without substance&#xD;
           addiction. Methods- Inclusion criteria-&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Anti-retroviral therapy naïve patients 2. Age &gt; 12 years Exclusion criteria-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 'Transferred in' patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Age &lt; 12 years. A prospective cohort studies. At Anti-retroviral therapy centre, Sadar&#xD;
           Hospital Khagaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flow chart- First visit of HIV seropositive patient-----History/clinical examination of&#xD;
      patients H/o substance abuse (nature of substance. ? drug dependence/abuse)-------search of&#xD;
      opportunistic infections-----------CD4 T cell count-----anti-retroviral drugs and treatment&#xD;
      of OI, if present------follow up biweekly (first month)-----then monthly follow up for six&#xD;
      months------CD4+ T cell count.&#xD;
