      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe the effect of routine practice with alglucosidase alfa (GAA) in patients with&#xD;
      IOPD ≤6 months of age, on invasive ventilation-free survival after 52 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the effect of routine practice with alglucosidase alfa on invasive&#xD;
           ventilation-free survival and survival at 12 and 18 months of age, as well as on change&#xD;
           in left ventricular mass (LVM) Z score, Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) score, body&#xD;
           weight, body length, and head circumference Z scores, and urinary glucose&#xD;
           tetrasaccharide (Hex4), at Week 52 of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of alglucosidase alfa in the&#xD;
           routine practice of IOPD treatment.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  At the time of informed consent, participants must be ≤6 months and 0 days of age,&#xD;
             corrected for gestation if necessary. Gestational age &lt;40 weeks will be adjusted to a&#xD;
             full-term gestational age of 40 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have alglucosidase alfa enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) planned or&#xD;
             initiated for IOPD treatment irrespective of study participation, according to the&#xD;
             treating physician's decision regarding participants' routine disease management.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have available and accessible medical records from the time of IOPD&#xD;
             diagnosis and from subsequent follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have a confirmed diagnosis of IOPD, defined as presence of 2&#xD;
             pathogenic GAA variants and documented GAA deficiency in blood (dried blood spot [DBS]&#xD;
             accepted), skin, or muscle tissue, or presence of 1 pathogenic GAA variant and&#xD;
             documented GAA deficiency in blood, skin, or muscle tissue from separate samples&#xD;
             (either from 2 different tissues or from the same tissue but at 2 different sampling&#xD;
             dates.) (DBS and leukocytes are acceptable as 2 different samples from blood).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have established cross-reacting immunologic material (CRIM) status&#xD;
             available prior to enrollment. CRIM status may be provided by historical CRIM testing&#xD;
             results or prediction of CRIM status based on genotyping performed at a Clinical&#xD;
             Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) or other appropriately certified genetic&#xD;
             laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have cardiomyopathy at the time of diagnosis (LVMI equivalent to&#xD;
             mean age-specific LVMI):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  LVMI +1 standard deviation (SD) in participants diagnosed by newborn or sibling&#xD;
             screening,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  LVMI +2 SD in participants diagnosed by clinical evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have informed consent provided by parent(s)/legally acceptable&#xD;
             representatives (LARs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with respiratory insufficiency, defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Oxygen saturation &lt;90% on room air as determined by pulse oximetry,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Venous partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) &gt;55 mmHg or arterial pCO2 &gt;40 mmHg on&#xD;
             room air,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of invasive (with intubation or tracheostomy) or noninvasive (no intubation or&#xD;
             tracheostomy) ventilation at enrollment, for participants not having started ERT at&#xD;
             enrollment,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of invasive or noninvasive ventilation at the time of ERT initiation, for&#xD;
             participants having started ERT before enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with major congenital abnormality including heart defect, neural tube&#xD;
             defect, or Down syndrome that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude&#xD;
             participation in the study or potentially decrease survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with clinically significant organic disease other than signs/symptoms&#xD;
             related to Pompe disease, including clinically significant cardiovascular, hepatic,&#xD;
             pulmonary, neurologic, or renal disease, or other medical condition, serious&#xD;
             intercurrent illness, or circumstance that, in the opinion of the investigator, would&#xD;
             preclude participation or potentially decrease survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous or ongoing treatment in any clinical trial of, or managed access program for,&#xD;
             avalglucosidase alfa or any other Pompe disease-specific therapy.&#xD;
