  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was planned to determine the effect of breast milk odor applied during gavage&#xD;
      feeding on early feeding cues of preterm newborns, the transition time to oral feeding and&#xD;
      abdominal perfusion.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is known that nutrient odors stimulate the initiation of digestion. However, in preterm&#xD;
      newborns who are fed by gavage or parenterally, exposure to the nutrient smell that initiates&#xD;
      digestion disappears. For this reason, it is known that odor stimulation is applied to&#xD;
      preterm newborns to improve nutrition. It is known that fragrances such as fragrant essential&#xD;
      oils, the smell of breast milk, and amniotic fluid have positive effects such as shortening&#xD;
      the transition time to oral feeding in preterm newborns, increasing nutritional tolerance and&#xD;
      weight gain, increasing hunger symptoms, providing analgesic effect in painful procedures,&#xD;
      and reducing hospital stay. However, no study was found to jointly evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      odor stimulation with breast milk on early nutritional cues, transition time to oral&#xD;
      nutrition and abdominal perfusion in preterm newborns.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>In this study, stratified sampling was used according to postmenstrual week (PW) and type of nutrition. In order to ensure homogeneity in the intervention and control groups, according to PW [28-(33+6)] and [34-35+6)], according to the type of nutrition [mixed nutrition (breast milk + formula milk)] and [breast milk] 4 layers were formed. Firstly, 56 preterm newborns were divided as random into intervention (group A) and control (group B). Groups A and B were stratified first to the PW, then according to the type of feeding. Permutation was also used to strike a balance between the strata. Block sets were generated for each combination of the prognostic factors (PW and type of nutrition). The intervention and control groups were then randomized into the strata using a random numbers table.</intervention_model_description>

In the form; gender of the baby, date of birth, method of birth, gestational week at birth, average apgar score (1. and 5. in minutes), birth weight, postnatal age, duration of transition to oral nutrition, daily body weight, nutrition frequency, amount of nutrition, food type, breast milk type, daily vomiting frequency and daily defecation frequency are information.</description>

    <description>It is a form that contains information about abdominal perfusion level developed by researchers in accordance with the literature (Gay ve ark. 2011, Gillam-Krakauer ve ark. 2013, Thomas ve ark. 2018). Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) is a noninvasive device used in routine of neonatal intensive care unit and will be used in this study to determine the abdominal perfusion of the baby.</description>

    <measure>Early Feeding Tips Tracking Form</measure>
    <time_frame>Before 1 minute from feeding</time_frame>
    <description>The form developed by the researchers in line with the literature includes the physiological and behavioral hunger symptoms of the baby, which are accepted as criteria for starting oral feeding in babies and maintaining oral nutrition successfully and reliably (Kirk, Alder ve King 2007, Ludwig ve Waitzman 2007, White ve Parnell 2013, Holloway 2014, Lubbe 2018). The form consists of 9 items, and the answers to the items are in the form of Yes / No. Evaluation of the items in the form will be done simultaneously and separately by two observers (researcher and clinical nurse) right after the babies begin to feed, and interobserver agreement will be evaluated in order to test the reliability of the form.</description>

    <description>Newborns in the experimental group will be given the smell of breast milk during 3 consecutive feedings and for 3 days in the morning. Smell stimulation will be started 1 minute before gavage feeding and the application of breast milk odor will continue until the feeding ends. A hand-cleaning researcher will drip 15 drops of breast milk on sterile gauze to apply the smell of breast milk. Sterile gauze dripped with breast milk will be placed as close to the newborn's nose as possible and not in contact with the newborn's skin. After the feeding of the newborn is completed, the application of the smell of breast milk will be terminated and the gauze will be removed from the incubator. A new sterile gauze will be used for each feeding, and these processes will be repeated with each smell stimulation for three days.</description>
