      PreBioGyn will be compared to market leading vaginal pH buffering gels using established&#xD;
      forearm test methods associated with vaginal lubricity sensation in 42 women. Women will also&#xD;
      rate each gel for smell and appearance using established methods. The PreBioGyn gel enclosure&#xD;
      and intravaginal applicator design will be evaluated for: look and feel, ability to prepare&#xD;
      for dosing, ability to expulse dose, and likelihood of future use by subjects. Open-ended&#xD;
      feedback on the gel and applicator will occur to gather contributions for each product.&#xD;

      This study is being conducted as a component of a NIH/NCI sponsored Small Business Technology&#xD;
      Transfer (STTR) project entitled &quot;Cervical Cancer Prevention Prebiotic Device.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prebiotic vaginal gel, PreBioGyn, has been developed to optimize vaginal health and&#xD;
      reduce the risk of cervical cancer in women. Use of the gel targets a combination of&#xD;
      biological risk factors for cervical cancer including restoring and maintaining healthy&#xD;
      vaginal microbiota, pH, and mucosal function, thereby preventing disturbed immunity and&#xD;
      inflammation caused by dysbiosis and mucosal microtrauma. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      provide a quantitative perception evaluation of the acceptability of PreBioGyn and its&#xD;
      applicator system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Perform a quantitative sensory evaluation to determine the topical acceptability of&#xD;
           PreBioGyn, as well as receive qualitative feedback on the gel, as compared to&#xD;
           competitive products.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Obtain quantitative and qualitative feedback regarding acceptability of the PreBioGyn&#xD;
           applicator compared to those for existing competitive products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These Study Objectives do not involve actual intravaginal use of the product. Rather, this&#xD;
      activity will involve presentation of the products in a forearm and finger-touch sensory&#xD;
      evaluation, and the answering of questions related to this perceptual evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, single-blind, cross-over study that will include 42 women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative sensory evaluation and qualitative feedback to determine the acceptability of&#xD;
      the prebiotic vaginal gel (PreBioGyn) as compared to competitive products&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative evaluation of PreBioGyn and two competitive vaginal pH buffer-gels will be&#xD;
      performed. The four key qualitative parameters to be evaluated are slipperiness, tackiness,&#xD;
      appearance, and smell. These parameters are key functional outcomes for the final PreBioGyn&#xD;
      formula. Qualitative feedback and likelihood of use for each gel will also be collected and&#xD;
      scored.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Quantitative Assessment of Slipperiness and Tackiness (&quot;lubricity&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Quantitative perceptual lubricity (slipperiness and tackiness) will be determined using&#xD;
           a standardized methodology wherein participants discriminate differences between the&#xD;
           PreBioGyn and two competitive products, versus positive and negative anchor products.&#xD;
           Products are evaluated on the skin (forearm area) ex vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will each receive the positive and negative anchors, then the three gel&#xD;
           products, on three different 4-cm circular forearm sites. The order of the gels, and the&#xD;
           circle to which it was applied, will be determined randomly based on a&#xD;
           computer-generated randomization table. Each treatment is replicated twice. Participants&#xD;
           will be blinded to the specific products used.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Fingers and circles will be wiped with a low-residue baby-wipe and paper towel. The&#xD;
           investigator dispenses 0.2 ml of the sample into the center of the circle previously&#xD;
           drawn on the forearm. The sample is rubbed in a circle using the index finger at a rate&#xD;
           of 2 revolutions per second for 15 seconds and followed with another 45 seconds (60&#xD;
           second time point). A metronome is set at 120 bpm and played to standardize the&#xD;
           manipulation rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At time points 15 and 60 seconds, slipperiness is evaluated using a visual analog scale&#xD;
           (VAS). The two ends of the visual analog scale are anchored by the phrases &quot;not&#xD;
           slippery&quot; and &quot;very slippery.&quot; The participant is asked to make a mark on the VAS at the&#xD;
           point of their slipperiness assessment between the two anchors. Prior to study gel&#xD;
           measurements, participants will perform evaluations on two products representing the&#xD;
           negative anchor &quot;not slippery&quot; (lanolin) and positive anchor &quot;very slippery&quot; (Gun Oil™&#xD;
           lubricant).&#xD;
&#xD;
           At the 60-second time point, and after the slipperiness score is recorded, subjects will&#xD;
           assess tackiness by tapping their finger up and down for 5 seconds on the skin in the&#xD;
           circle just used to assess slipperiness.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Tackiness is evaluated using the visual analog scale. The two ends of the visual analog&#xD;
           scale are anchored by the phrases &quot;Not tacky or sticky&quot; and &quot;very tacky or sticky.&quot; The&#xD;
           focus group participant is asked to make a mark on the VAS at the point of their&#xD;
           tackiness assessment between the two anchors. Prior to study gel measurements,&#xD;
           participants will perform evaluations on two products representing the anchors of &quot;very&#xD;
           tacky&quot; (lanolin) and &quot;not tacky&quot; (Gun Oil® lubricant). The degree of slipperiness and&#xD;
           tackiness is determined by measuring the distance of the participants mark on the visual&#xD;
           analog scale from the left baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Qualitative Assessment of Appearance and Smell and Overall Perception.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study participants will be asked to rate the appearance and smell of the PreBioGyn and&#xD;
           competitive products following the end of the quantitative assessment period. The&#xD;
           traditional nine-point hedonic scale will be used to assess the degree of liking or&#xD;
           disliking of each gel's smell and appearance. The reliability, validity and&#xD;
           discriminative ability of the scale has been proven in food, cosmetic, and personal care&#xD;
           product acceptance tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Two milliliters (2 ml) of each lubricant will be dispensed from a prefilled syringe onto&#xD;
           a small clear plastic petri dish. The order of the gel will be determined randomly based&#xD;
           on a computer-generated randomization table. Each treatment is replicated twice.&#xD;
           Participants will be blinded to the product identity. Subjects will be asked to observe&#xD;
           the gels under good lighting, smell the gels from a distance of approximately 2-5 cm&#xD;
           from the end of their nose, and then rate each gel on the Hedonic scale. Finally,&#xD;
           open-ended feedback on the gels, including likelihood of use as a proposed product to&#xD;
           decrease cervical cancer risk, will occur using the &quot;I Like, I Wish, What If&quot; method to&#xD;
           gather participant contributions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Quantitative and Qualitative Feedback Regarding Acceptability of the PreBioGyn&#xD;
           Applicator Compared to Competitive Products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women will rank the PreBioGyn applicator versus that of competitive products in a 9-point&#xD;
      Hedonic scale for acceptability of the applicator look and feel; the usability for preparing&#xD;
      the applicator for dosing, and the usability to expel the gel (table-top). Finally, the&#xD;
      overall reaction to the concept of inserting each applicator vaginally will be rated, as well&#xD;
      as a 5-point Likert-scale rating of likelihood of future use of each product to reduce&#xD;
      cervical cancer risk. Finally, open-ended feedback on the applicators will occur using the &quot;I&#xD;
      Like, I Wish, What If&quot; method to gather participant contributions.&#xD;
