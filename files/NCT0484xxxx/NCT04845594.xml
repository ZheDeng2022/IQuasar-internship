  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to evaluate the best way to encourage a healthy diet and proper fluoride use&#xD;
      in children at greatest risk for tooth decay. To do so, this study will evaluate whether or&#xD;
      not a family focused intervention, MySmileBuddy, is able to reduce tooth decay progression in&#xD;
      Hispanic preschoolers at high risk of this disease.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tooth decay in young children has traditionally been treated through surgical dental repair,&#xD;
      an approach that does not address the oral hygiene and dietary behaviors that cause the&#xD;
      disease. Professionals agree that behavioral strategies to prevent tooth decay are needed,&#xD;
      but they have not been well studied in Hispanic children in the United States that have&#xD;
      disproportionately high rates of this disease. Use of fluoridated toothpaste twice a day and&#xD;
      consumption of a healthy diet can both prevent tooth decay and stop it from progressing.&#xD;

  <why_stopped>
    This study was halted prior to the start of enrollment due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The&#xD;
    inability to conduct planned in-person intervention activities during the pandemic related to&#xD;
    inherent risks of the virus necessitated withdrawal of the study.&#xD;

    <description>Early childhood caries status will be determined by visual examination, assisted by an examination light, mirror, and probe with caries experience defined by number of teeth (t) and surfaces (s) that either have decay (d), are missing due to decay (m), or have had a dental filling (f) due to a cavity.</description>

    <description>The number of decayed, missing, or filled teeth (dmft)/decayed filled surfaces (dfs) as a count variable will be measured to determine the proportion of participants who have a positive change in the number of dmft/dfs post-intervention.</description>

    <description>Tooth brushing behaviors will be assess by asking parents a series of multiple choice and open-ended questions and direct observation of tooth brushing behavior measured using the Tooth Brushing Observation Scale (Collett, et al., 2016) at baseline (T1) and 12 months post-randomization (T2).</description>
