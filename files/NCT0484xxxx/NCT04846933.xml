  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy resistance is the greatest contributor to mortality in advanced cancers and&#xD;
      severe challenges remain in finding effective treatment modalities to cancer patients with&#xD;
      metastasized and relapsed disease. High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is typically&#xD;
      diagnosed at a stage where the disease is already widely spread to the abdomen and current&#xD;
      standard of practice treatment consists of surgery followed by platinum-taxane based&#xD;
      chemotherapy and maintenance therapy. While 90% of HGSOC patients show no clinically&#xD;
      detectable signs of cancer after surgery and chemotherapy, only 43% of the patients are alive&#xD;
      five years after diagnosis because of chemoresistant cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, observational trial focuses on revealing major mechanisms causing&#xD;
      chemoresistance in HGSOG patients and derive personalized treatment regimens for chemotherapy&#xD;
      resistant HGSOC patients. The investigators recruit newly diagnosed advanced stage HGSOC&#xD;
      patients who are then thoroughly followed during their cancer treatment. Longitudinal&#xD;
      sampling includes digitalized H&amp;E stained histology slides mainly collected during routine&#xD;
      diagnostics, fresh tumor &amp; ascites samples for next-generation sequencing/proteomics (WGS,&#xD;
      RNA-seq, DNA-methylation, ChIP-seq, mass cytometry, etc.) and ex vivo experiments, plasma&#xD;
      samples for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analyses. Broad range of clinical parameters such&#xD;
      as laboratory and radiologic parameters (e.g., FDG PET/CT), given cancer treatments and their&#xD;
      outcomes are collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general objective is to establish a clinically useful precision oncology approach based&#xD;
      on multi-level data collected in longitudinal setting, and translate the most potent and&#xD;
      validated discoveries into clinical use. DECIDER project will produce AI-powered diagnostic&#xD;
      tools, cutting-edge software platforms for clinical decision-making, novel data analysis &amp;&#xD;
      integration methods, and high-throughput ex vivo drug screening approaches.&#xD;

      Specific aims include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop tools and methods for personalized medicine approaches to cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop open-source visualization and interpretation software that facilitate clinical&#xD;
           decision making via data integration and interpretation of multilevel data from cancer&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rapidly identify HGSOC patients who are likely to respond poorly to current therapies&#xD;
           combining information on digitalized histopathology samples, genomic and clinical data&#xD;
           with AI methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Deploy validated personalized medicine treatment options using longitudinal measurement&#xD;
           and ex vivo cultures from cancer patients in clinical care.&#xD;
