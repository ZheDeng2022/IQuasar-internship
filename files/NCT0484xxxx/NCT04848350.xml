  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to determine the effects of inhalation aromatherapy on pain and anxiety during&#xD;
      the SWL protocol. This study included 120 patients who were scheduled to undergo SWL.&#xD;
      Patients were randomly assigned a control placebo group 1 (n=40), the lavender group 2&#xD;
      (n=40), and the frankincense group 3 (n=40). The nebulizer (a rate of 2%) was prepared and&#xD;
      operated on in the SWL room before the procedure. Data were collected using the visual analog&#xD;
      scale (VAS) and the State Anxiety Inventory (STAI-I).&#xD;

      Shock Wave Lithotripsy (SWL) is widely and effectively used in the treatment of urinary tract&#xD;
      stone disease. In the first applied lithotriptors, the energy density and maximum energy&#xD;
      application at the skin level revealed the need for anesthesia in terms of pain. Later, with&#xD;
      the development of new devices, the physics parameters were changed and shock was applied&#xD;
      with lower energy levels, using large ellipsoids, the area where shock waves enter the skin&#xD;
      is reduced and anesthesia is restricted. During the SWL procedure, patients can identify pain&#xD;
      in the form of a subjective sensation that is difficult to identify. Pain occurs for two&#xD;
      reasons. The first is the trauma caused by shock waves moving towards the kidney as they pass&#xD;
      through the skin and muscles, and the second is the deep organ pain due to the trauma caused&#xD;
      by shock waves in the kidney Also, various patient-related and environmental factors&#xD;
      affecting pain should be considered. The sedation of patients greatly facilitates SWL&#xD;
      tolerance. However, it has been noted in various studies that patients with anxiety&#xD;
      experience more pain during SWL. Aromatherapy is a TAT (Tapas Acupressure technique) method&#xD;
      in which essential oils created from fragrant parts of plants are absorbed from the body and&#xD;
      show their effects. The therapeutic, disease-relieving or preventive properties of essential&#xD;
      oils are utilized. Essential oils can be applied to the body by topical, internal, oral, and&#xD;
      inhalation methods. The fastest and easiest way of entry of essential oils into the body is&#xD;
      inhalation. When applied through breathing, evaporating molecules reach the olfactory bulb&#xD;
      through the nose and the limbic system in the brain. Aromatherapy provides control of pain&#xD;
      and anxiety by affecting the amygdala and hippocampus, which regulate fear and aggressive&#xD;
      behaviors in the limbic system. Aromatherapy by Inhaler is used in hemodialysis, dental&#xD;
      procedures, intrauterine contraceptive placement, pain and anxiety control in patients with&#xD;
      arthritis. The literature shows that Lavender (lavandula officinalis) and Frankincense&#xD;
      (Boswellia) essential oils are used in pain and anxiety management in procedural pain and&#xD;
      anxiety control.&#xD;

    <measure>VAS score</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Patients ' pain levels were measured using the VAS pain scale. This is a horizontal scale, ranging from 0 (no pain) on the left side to 10 (most severe pain) on the right side. Pain intensity can be categorized as mild (score, 1-3), moderate (score, 4-6), and severe (score, 7-10) according to the scale.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Discomfort Intolerance Scale-Revised (DIS-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The scala assesses the perceived inability to tolerate physical discomfort, beliefs about physical discomfort, and responses to feelings of physical discomfort. The DIS-R consists of nine items (e.g., &quot;I can't handle feeling physical discomfort&quot;) rated on a 7-point Likert-type scale (0=not at all like me to 6=extremely like me) with higher scores indicating greater discomfort intolerance. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the revised 9-item version was a good fit to the data and demonstrated good construct validity in both symptomatic (i.e., clinically-elevated levels of depression or anxiety) and non-symptomatic samples.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>STAI form</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The STAI form was used to determine the transitory emotional state and anxiety level of the participants after the procedure. This scale, consisting of 20 items, uses a 4-point Likert scale in which items are scored from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much). The assessment of the inventory is based on the total score ranging from 20 to 80. A score from1 to 20 is considered to indicate no anxiety, a score of 21 to 40 indicates mild anxiety, a score of 41 to 60 indicates moderate anxiety, and a score of 61 and higher indicates severe anxiety</description>
