  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are common and from the most recent global&#xD;
      epidemiology study, an estimated 40% of the world population suffer from the condition. FGIDs&#xD;
      cause significant morbidity to patients, despite not influencing mortality. IBS is among the&#xD;
      most important functional gastrointestinal disorder with an estimated 3.8 to 9.2 % of the&#xD;
      general population worldwide were affected by this disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rifaximin (gut specific antibiotic) and low FODMAP diet (dietary based therapy) were proven&#xD;
      to be effective in treating irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), however there was no head-to-head&#xD;
      study comparing both treatments. This study will help doctors to understand the efficacy of&#xD;
      different IBS/SIBO treatments. With the evaluation of factors that can predict treatment&#xD;
      response, doctor could potentially treat IBS and SIBO more effectively in future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to compare the clinical symptoms and psychological improvement in&#xD;
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) after treatment with Rifaximin versus treatment&#xD;
      with low FODMAP diet. The factors that is associated with treatment response will also be&#xD;
      evaluated. In IBS patients with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), eradication&#xD;
      rate of SIBO will be evaluated.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of subjects with adequate relief of composite of abdominal symptom (pain/discomfort) and stool symptom (frequency/ consistency) after treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Adequate relief was defined as self-reported relief of both symptoms (abdominal symptom and stool symptom) at least in week 2 or 4. (Subjects will be provided with self-reported questionnaires for week 2 and 4).&#xD;
For IBS-D, relief was defined as a decrease of at least 30% from baseline in weekly mean ratings of IBS-related abdominal pain or discomfort and a weekly decrease of at least 50% in the number of days per week with at least one stool that has a consistency of Type 6 or 7 compared with baseline.&#xD;
For IBS-C, relief was defined as a decrease of at least 30% from baseline in weekly mean ratings of IBS-related abdominal pain or discomfort and an increase of 1 or more complete spontaneous bowel movement (CSBM) per week compared with baseline.&#xD;
For IBS-M, relief was defined as fulfilled both IBS-D and IBS-C symptom relief criteria.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of patients who had relief was determined from the patients' weekly assessments of global IBS symptoms, bloating, abdominal pain/ discomfort, and stool consistency/ frequency after treatment with Rifaximin or low FODMAP diet</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Rated on a 5-point scale: 2 = Significantly Relieved, 1 = Moderately Relieved, 0 = Unchanged, -1 = Moderately Worse, and -2 = Significantly Worse for at least 50% of the days in a week.&#xD;
Relief was defined as a score of either 2 (Significantly Relieved) or 1 (Moderately Relieved).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptom severity score improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The symptom severity was assessed by the IBS-symptom severity (IBS-SS) score from baseline to 4 weeks after initiation of treatment. Total scores ranging from 0 to 500</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of patients with SIBO who had eradication of SIBO after treatment</measure>

    <measure>Assessment of factors that were associated with treatment response</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline characteristic (age, gender, ethnicity), IBS subtype (IBS-D, IBS-C IBS-mixed), and SIBO status (positive or negative) of patients who responded to treatment (based on primary outcome) will be compared to non-responder</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) score</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>HRQOL will be assessed using EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) instrument. Overall utility score (as mean value) was calculated with a range score from 0 (worst health scenario) to a maximum of 1.0 (best health scenario).</description>
