      Interpreting the cry of new-borns is a real challenge not only for perinatal professionals&#xD;
      but also for parents, who are confronted daily with those sounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The description and the acoustic analysis of baby's cry can allow healthcare professionals to&#xD;
      better adapt their care during the first months of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thanks to an objective analysis method as acoustic analysis, the particularities of the first&#xD;
      cry should provide us information on the quality of adaptation to ambient air life.&#xD;

      Interpreting the cry of new-borns is a real challenge not only for perinatal professionals&#xD;
      but also for parents, who are confronted daily with those sounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The description and the acoustic analysis of baby's cry can allow healthcare professionals to&#xD;
      better adapt their care during the first months of life. Aiming for this objective, many&#xD;
      studies have already been carried out on infants crying in the first months of life, in order&#xD;
      to better understand their significance (pain, discomfort, hunger) and the mechanisms of&#xD;
      recognition and discrimination by parents or listeners. Various techniques are promising to&#xD;
      characterize the acoustic space of cry (maximum frequency, intensity, harmonics, duration…).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, few studies have investigated the acoustic characteristics of the first cry of life&#xD;
      in the delivery room. Its intensity and characteristics are closely related to the laryngeal&#xD;
      anatomy and respiratory capacity. Thus, a vigorous cry with its own acoustic characteristics&#xD;
      could be the witness of a good adaptation to extra uterine life, while a weak or plaintive&#xD;
      cry should warn the caregiver on difficulties in this adaptation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thanks to an objective analysis method as acoustic analysis, the particularities of the first&#xD;
      cry should provide us information on the quality of adaptation to ambient air life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the acoustic characteristics of the first cries of&#xD;
      newborns recorded at birth are correlated with the criteria of extra uterine life adaptation&#xD;
      (Apgar score, pH and lactates collected from the umbilical cord), with the respiratory score&#xD;
      (Silverman) and with the early neonatal outcome (transfer to the intensive care unit).&#xD;
