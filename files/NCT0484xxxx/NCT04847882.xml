  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our primary purpose is to compare the prevalence of sleep disorders in children aged 6 to 17&#xD;
      with cystic fibrosis versus controls with a Sleep disorder screening score, the SDSC. Our&#xD;
      hypothesis is that patients aged 6 to 17 with cystic fibrosis have a higher prevalence of&#xD;
      sleep disturbances than the general population of the same age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our secondary hypothesis is that these sleep disorders are mixed and that there are&#xD;
      non-respiratory causes, sometimes modifiable by simple non-medical treatment and that's why&#xD;
      our secondary purpose is to identify the responsible factors, in particular non-respiratory&#xD;
      factors in the 2 groups and to compare them.&#xD;

    <arm_group_label>Control group, children from 6 to 17.</arm_group_label>
    <description>This group is the control group. It is made up of children consulting in pediatric surgical emergencies, aged 6 to 17 years. Surgical emergencies were chosen because it is a point of consultation, rather accidental, where sleep has often not been impacted in the previous months and where the frequency of chronic pathology is not higher than the general population.&#xD;
An other criteria is that these children are accompanied by at least one of their parents and that they can read and understand French well.</description>
