  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Healthcare workers that care for patients with COVID-19 are at increased risk for&#xD;
      stress-related symptoms. When these symptoms are chronic, they can result in burnout and&#xD;
      other mental health conditions that can exacerbate the current national health crisis. Social&#xD;
      distancing can limit the accessibility of mental health services. Feasible and effective&#xD;
      interventions are needed to reduce stress-related symptoms and promote resilience in this&#xD;
      population, while adhering to federal and local guidelines to mitigate the transmission of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To investigate the feasibility and efficacy of a combined nature-based and&#xD;
      virtual mindfulness intervention on stress-related symptoms and psychological resilience in&#xD;
      healthcare workers that care for patients with COVID-19. Both components are reported to&#xD;
      reduce levels of perceived stress and increase psychological resilience; however, the&#xD;
      potential additive effect of their combined delivery is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Ninety healthcare workers will be randomized into one of three groups:&#xD;
      Nature+Mindfulness (n=30), Nature only (n=30), and Control (n=30). All participants will&#xD;
      undergo assessments at baseline (week 0), post nature intervention (~week 1), and post&#xD;
      mindfulness intervention (~week 3). The two intervention groups will have one final&#xD;
      assessment at 2-month follow-up (~week 11). Perceived stress is the primary endpoint and will&#xD;
      be assessed with the Perceived Stress Scale. Secondary endpoints include sleep quality,&#xD;
      burnout, posttraumatic stress, anxiety, depression, mindfulness, self-efficacy, and&#xD;
      psycho-social-spiritual healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated Results: We anticipate that participants in the Nature+Mindfulness group will&#xD;
      have greater reductions in stress-related symptoms and greater increases in psychological&#xD;
      resilience compared with the Nature only and Control groups.&#xD;

      Potential participants will be recruited through First Descents, a non-profit 501(c)(3)&#xD;
      organization located in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nature-based intervention is three days long and includes activities such as hiking,&#xD;
      mountain-biking, and kayaking. The virtual mindfulness intervention is 10 to 25 minutes daily&#xD;
      for 10 days and is offered online. Mindfulness exercises include mindful breathing, body&#xD;
      scan, and loving-kindness meditation.&#xD;

    <description>The nature-based intervention is three days long, is offered at various locations throughout the United States, and includes activities such as hiking, mountain-biking, and kayaking. The healthcare workers can participate in the programs that are offered locally pending availability. Each program will enroll between 15 and 30 healthcare workers. All First Descents nature-based interventions have been intentionally designed with input from more than 450 hospital partners nationwide to improve psychosocial health, nurture supportive peer relationships, and better position healthcare workers to carry out their critical mission. There is no cost to attend, and meals and lodging are included. Special precautions against SARS-CoV-2 transmission are implemented.</description>

    <description>In the combined nature-based and virtual mindfulness intervention, participants will complete the nature intervention followed by the mindfulness intervention. The virtual mindfulness intervention is 10 days long and offered online. Each day the participant will receive a notification that a new mindfulness audio is ready for viewing, which is from 10 to 25 minutes long. Mindfulness exercises include mindful breathing, body scan, and loving-kindness meditation. Participants can view the daily audio as many times as they wish but cannot view the next day's content to maintain treatment fidelity. At the end of each day, participants will be asked to indicate if they viewed the mindfulness audio to track adherence.</description>
