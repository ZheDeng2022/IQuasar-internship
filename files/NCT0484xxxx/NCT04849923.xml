      Background: Muscular strength training interventions have long been a cornerstone in the&#xD;
      prevention, non-surgical management and rehabilitation of the entire spectrum of&#xD;
      musculoskeletal injuries and diseases. The key goal of strength training, especially during&#xD;
      rehabilitation, is to regain healthy musculoskeletal function. Yet, there remains a&#xD;
      fundamental lack of understanding with regards to the relationship between subject-specific&#xD;
      musculoskeletal biomechanics (i.e. multi-body dynamics function) and different types of&#xD;
      strength training interventions because of limitations in assessing these parameters outside&#xD;
      the research setting. Thus, clinicians, physiotherapists and coaches continue making training&#xD;
      recommendations based on subjective and generalised guidelines, with ineffective or possibly&#xD;
      harmful consequences for individual patients and athletes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal: This project aims to advance strength training guidelines and monitoring of training&#xD;
      safety and efficiency by means of subject-specific anatomically-based modelling,&#xD;
      biomechanical analysis of musculoskeletal function and mobile monitoring of training volume&#xD;
      and muscular fatigue in the athletic and recreational setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: For validation purposes, the investigators will conduct an 8-week intervention study&#xD;
      in healthy volunteers with three levels of strength training volume of the key muscle-tendon&#xD;
      groups associated with knee joint stability and relate the changes in musculoskeletal and&#xD;
      biomechanical parameters to the training-specific parameters and muscular fatigue from mobile&#xD;
      monitoring through correlation analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance: In Switzerland, more than 1.3 Mio people are members of a fitness center. Strength&#xD;
      training is not only a cornerstone in the maintenance of fitness and rehabilitation from&#xD;
      musculoskeletal injuries and diseases as the most frequently reported health issues.&#xD;

      Hypothesis: It is hypothesized that advanced subject-specific musculoskeletal modelling in&#xD;
      combination with mobile monitoring technology as embedded in the iPhone and Apple Watch allow&#xD;
      for accurate prediction of changes in muscle strength and muscle size in the lower limbs&#xD;
      following an 8-week strength training intervention of key muscle-tendon groups associated&#xD;
      with knee joint stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: Prediction of changes in muscle strength in the lower limbs due to&#xD;
      different strength training volumes by means of the advanced computational modelling,&#xD;
      biomechanical analysis and mobile monitoring technology. Of particular interest is the&#xD;
      prediction of 1RM and the prediction of the ratio between hamstrings and quadriceps strength&#xD;
      (H:Q ratio) compared against isokinetic strength tests as gold standard. Research has clearly&#xD;
      shown that the quantification of 1RM is fundamentally important when it comes to the design&#xD;
      of safe and efficient resistance training programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: Assessment of changes in muscle size in the lower limbs due to different&#xD;
      strength training volumes using the HMF technique. Of particular interest is the prediction&#xD;
      of muscle volume using the HMF technique compared against data from MRI as gold standard, as&#xD;
      well as the prediction of adaptation in hamstrings and quadriceps CSA due to the strength&#xD;
      training intervention using HMF versus data from ultrasound, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key baseline factors that will likely influence the primary and secondary endpoints are&#xD;
      strength training experience and gender. The sample size and population group are specified&#xD;
      to allow the analysis of gender-specific differences on study results. Thereby, the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria and study protocol, including a training-related questionnaire,&#xD;
      are defined to minimize the bias of training experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project design This project in sports science is designed as a confirmatory qualitative study&#xD;
      in applied research involving healthy participants. The rationale of this project is to&#xD;
      predict changes in muscle strength and muscle size due to strength training using&#xD;
      computational modelling and mobile monitoring technology. In particular, the investigators&#xD;
      will advance novel approaches in subject-specific anatomically-based modelling and mobile&#xD;
      monitoring, which have previously tested in the research setting, and are now being applied&#xD;
      to an intervention study in healthy volunteers to predict adaptations in muscle strength and&#xD;
      muscle size in relation to strength training volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The specifics of the strength training intervention are carefully designed&#xD;
      based on the current state of research in the field, and in line with strength training&#xD;
      recommendations in musculoskeletal health, fitness and rehabilitation. In particular, the&#xD;
      investigators will conduct an 8-week strength training intervention program of the key&#xD;
      muscle-tendon groups associated with knee joint stability (hamstrings, quadriceps and triceps&#xD;
      surae), with the study group (n=36, with 18F and 18M) being randomly allocated to different&#xD;
      levels of training volume (Group#1: no training, Group#2: 1 training per week, Group#3: 3&#xD;
      trainings per week) with the same number of subjects and gender distribution in each group.&#xD;
      Each participant will perform the strength training self-directedly in their chosen&#xD;
      training-specific setting. Clear guidelines for warm-up, type and conduct of exercises will&#xD;
      be given to all participants. The strength exercises are standard exercises for strengthening&#xD;
      knee extension and flexion: squats, leg press, back extensions, heel raises, and single joint&#xD;
      exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study parameters: Anthropometric parameters include body height, body weight, segmental&#xD;
      circumferences, somatotype, body shape, muscle CSA and muscle volume of the lower limbs.&#xD;
      Anthropometric parameters will be assessed by means of HMF fitting in combination with data&#xD;
      from 3D body scanning and anthropometric measurements according to ISAK standards. Changes in&#xD;
      CSA of the hamstrings and quadriceps will be compared between HMF and data from ultrasound&#xD;
      before and after strength training intervention. Strength- and training-specific parameters&#xD;
      include joint motion, joint acceleration, total joint moments, repetition count, 1RM and H:Q&#xD;
      ratio. Strength- and training-specific parameters will be assessed by means of biomechanical&#xD;
      analysis using data from optical motion capture and the iOS Strength Control app, and&#xD;
      compared against data from isokinetic strength tests as gold standard. Additionally, data&#xD;
      from MRI of the lower limbs will be acquired in a sub-group of 12 participants (6F, 6M).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECT POPULATION AND STUDY PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project population: The project population are healthy adult subjects who are all&#xD;
      participating in their own strength training program on a regular weekly basis. The primary&#xD;
      objective is to predict changes in muscle strength (i.e. primary outcome parameters: 1RM and&#xD;
      H:Q ratio) following different training volumes of key muscle groups associated with knee&#xD;
      joint stability. A power analysis was conducted using statistikguru.de to assess the required&#xD;
      sample size for the primary outcome parameter, 1RM. Based on the power analysis, the&#xD;
      investigators aim for a total of n=36 complete data sets (n=12 per study group of the&#xD;
      strength training intervention), with a sub-group of n=12 participants additionally scheduled&#xD;
      for MRI of the lower limbs at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRI-based assessment of muscle volume for validation of the HMF technique is analyzed&#xD;
      independently from the strength training intervention. Thereby, the accuracy of the HMF&#xD;
      technique is dependent on the initial generic musculoskeletal model that is used for model&#xD;
      fitting, as well as the available subject-specific skin surface and anthropometric data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants have to confirm their voluntary participation with a written informed&#xD;
      consent before being submitted to any study procedure.&#xD;
