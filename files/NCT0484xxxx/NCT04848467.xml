  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most recently discovered coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) may cause illness in humans ranging&#xD;
      from the common cold to serious illness, also referred to as Coronavirus disease 2019&#xD;
      (COVID-19). As of January 2021, there are only few authorized vaccines available for the&#xD;
      prevention of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;CVnCoV&quot; is a new SARS-CoV-2 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccine which is currently&#xD;
      being developed for the prevention of COVID-19. The vaccine contains a molecule called mRNA&#xD;
      which serves as an instruction manual for the cells in the body to produce a piece of protein&#xD;
      from SARS-CoV-2 which activates the body´s defense system. The &quot;CVnCoV&quot; vaccine is injected&#xD;
      into the muscle. After the injection, the body recognizes the protein as something that does&#xD;
      not belong there. In this way the natural infection with the virus is imitated. The body&#xD;
      activates immune cells to produce antibodies against the virus and creates specific immune&#xD;
      cells called T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;CVnCoV&quot; is given in two doses separated by 28 days. In this study, the researchers will look&#xD;
      at how well &quot;CVnCoV&quot; works when the first of the two doses is given together with a flu&#xD;
      vaccine called seasonal quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV). They will also look at how well&#xD;
      the flu vaccine works under these conditions. The QIV is injected into the muscle and is&#xD;
      given as 1 dose. To see how well the participants' immune systems is activated by &quot;CVnCoV&quot;&#xD;
      and QIV, the researches will measure the levels of specific antibodies against the viruses in&#xD;
      the blood. Antibodies are proteins that allow the immune system to find and react to bacteria&#xD;
      and viruses in the body. The researches will look into how safe the vaccination is and which&#xD;
      type and degree of typical vaccination reactions are seen. To give &quot;CVnCoV&quot; and the flu&#xD;
      vaccine together in the future when needed, e.g. during the flu season, would reduce the&#xD;
      burden on the health system and on the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study are adults aged 60 years and older. In this study, participants&#xD;
      are assigned to one of the two parallel groups of the same size. The assignment to either&#xD;
      group is done by chance via a computer program. Participants in group 1 (Co-ad group) will&#xD;
      receive CVnCoV at the same visit as QIV. Participants in group 2 (control group) will receive&#xD;
      QIV and CVnCoV at two different visits. The Co-ad group will receive the first dose of CVnCoV&#xD;
      and a dose of QIV in opposite arms at Day 1, the second dose of CVnCoV at Day 29, and a&#xD;
      placebo injection, i.e. an injection that looks like a vaccination injection but does not&#xD;
      contain vaccine, at Day 57. The control group will receive QIV and placebo in opposite arms&#xD;
      at Day 1, the first dose of CVnCoV at day 29 and the second dose of CVnCoV at Day 57.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be five visits and four phone calls. During the study, the study team will take&#xD;
      blood samples on four occasions to measure the antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, and&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal swabs at 1 occasion. The physicians will do physical examinations at each&#xD;
      visit. The participants will be asked how they are feeling and if they have any medical&#xD;
      problems. They will, in addition, receive an electronic Diary to report medical problems.&#xD;
