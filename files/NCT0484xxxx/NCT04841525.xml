  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter longitudinal follow-up study to the main study of an a registered&#xD;
      already (NCT# ). The Follow-up Study (T4) will assess the Main Study cohort for an additional&#xD;
      longitudinal time point approximately 2-5 years after the initial study. Children&#xD;
      participating in the Follow-up Study will be approximately 8-16 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the main study is to identify, develop and validate a set of measures that can be&#xD;
      used as stratification biomarkers and/or sensitive and reliable objective measures of social&#xD;
      impairment in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) that could serve as markers of long term&#xD;
      clinical outcome.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants who were initially eligible for the main study will be eligible and invited&#xD;
      to return regardless of their participation at T2/T3 or current medication/psychiatric status&#xD;
      using an intent-to-treat model. The follow-up study will conduct one additional timepoint&#xD;
      with participants who enrolled in the main study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Follow-up Study of the Main Study ABC-CT cohort, the investigators will re-administer&#xD;
      the biomarker and clinical batteries 2-5 years after original study enrollment. This will&#xD;
      allow the investigators to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess long-term stability of the markers, extending the analyses of reliability and&#xD;
           consistency from the first phase of the consortium.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Perform a more robust assessment of sensitivity to change, taking advantage of a longer&#xD;
           developmental window in which participants are expected to exhibit greater clinical&#xD;
           progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the longitudinal predictive value of the biomarkers by examining the&#xD;
           association of their baseline values with later measures of social function.&#xD;

    <measure>N170 Latency to Upright Human Faces</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The N170 Latency to Upright Human Faces (N170 latency) is a scalp recorded EEG event-related potential (ERP) component elicited by perception of the upright human face. Recorded over the posterior-temporal right hemisphere, the latency (or speed) of the peak of the N170 ERP component occurs at approximately 200 msec in children aged 6 to 11 years of age.</description>

    <measure>VABS: Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales- III Socialization</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Administered in person visit during T4D1 or parent phone interview. The Socialization score is based on 3 subdomains of Interpersonal Relationships, Play &amp; Leisure, Coping Scales. The V-Scaled scores, which are specifically designed to measure change over time, are only available for the subdomains. The primary norm-referenced scores for the subdomains are v-scale scores, which have a mean of 15 and standard deviation (SD) of 3. The Vineland-3 is a standardized measure of adaptive behavior--the things that people do to function in their everyday lives.</description>

        For ASD Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        â€¢ Any known environmental circumstances that is likely to account for the picture of autism&#xD;
        in the proband (severe nutritional or psychological deprivation etc.)&#xD;

             treatment (medication or other treatment) for a psychiatric condition. Participants&#xD;
             will be screened using the Child/Adolescent Symptom Inventory (CASI-5). Due to the&#xD;
             measurements sensitivity, any score in the clinical range will be reviewed by research&#xD;
