    <textblock>
      This phase Ib/II trial finds out the best dose and effect of cladribine and low dose&#xD;
      cytarabine when given in combination with uproleselan in treating patients with treated&#xD;
      secondary acute myeloid leukemia. Chemotherapy drugs, such as uproleselan, cladribine, and&#xD;
      low dose cytarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by&#xD;
      killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety, tolerability, and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of uproleselan&#xD;
      combined with cladribine + low dose cytarabine (LDAC) in patients with treated-secondary&#xD;
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (ts-AML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the efficacy (overall response rate [ORR], complete response [CR], complete&#xD;
      response without blood count recovery [CRi], CR with partial hematologic recovery [CRh],&#xD;
      partial response [PR], or morphologic leukemia-free state of uproleselan combined with&#xD;
      cladribine + LDAC in patients with ts-AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity by flow cytometry at&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess overall survival (OS), remission duration (CRd), and progression-free survival&#xD;
      (PFS) in patients with ts-AML treated with uproleselan combined with cladribine + LDAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess the rate of complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) in patients with ts-AML with&#xD;
      abnormal baseline karyotype, treated with uproleselan combined with cladribine + LDAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess toxicity and induction mortality of patients with AML treated with uproleselan&#xD;
      added to cladribine + LDAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore biomarkers of response and resistance in patients with ts-AML treated with&#xD;
      uproleselan combined with cladribine + LDAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To examine the correlation of E-selectin ligand-forming glycosylation genes of leukemic&#xD;
      blasts with clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of cladribine and cytarabine followed by a&#xD;
      phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive uproleselan intravenously (IV) over 20 minutes on day 1&#xD;
      and every (Q) 12 hours on days 2-12, cladribine IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-5 and cytarabine&#xD;
      subcutaneously (SC) twice daily (BID) on days 1-10 in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients who do not achieve a CR or CRi after cycle 1 may receive a&#xD;
      second induction cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSOLIDATION/MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients receive uproleselan IV over 20 minutes on day 1&#xD;
      and Q12 hours on days 2-1. Patients who have achieved at least CR/CRi or morphologic&#xD;
      leukemia-free state after induction therapy receive uproleselan IV once daily (QD) on days&#xD;
      1-12. Patients also receive cladribine IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-3 and cytarabine SC BID on&#xD;
      days 1-10. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6-12 months.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the agents used in this study have&#xD;
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is a potential&#xD;
             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             the chemotherapy agents, breastfeeding should also be avoided&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to active uncontrolled&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA]&#xD;
             class III or IV), unstable angina pectoris, clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia,&#xD;
             or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
             requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with documented hypersensitivity to any of the components of the chemotherapy&#xD;
             program&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men and women of childbearing potential who do not practice contraception. Women of&#xD;
             childbearing potential and men must agree to use contraception prior to study entry&#xD;
             and for the duration of study participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with uproleselan&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (AML-M3) will be excluded&#xD;
             from this study&#xD;
