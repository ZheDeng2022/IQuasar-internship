      Objectives: This study compare the mental health impact and psychosocial perception of&#xD;
      healthcare workers and non healthcare workers in hospital after the first peak of COVID-19&#xD;
      outbreak in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The validated SATIN questionnaire with specific scoring was used to collect data on&#xD;
      health and psychosocial factors. A self-administered online questionnaire was send to all&#xD;
      workers of the hospital in June 2020. A multinomial regression model was created to assess&#xD;

      The survey was conducted between 01 th of July and 31th of August 2020 and involved all&#xD;
      workers employed in a teaching hospital in France. The total number of workers was 7299.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Inclusion criteria were as follows: working in the hospital since more than one year,&#xD;
      adults over than 18 years, acceptance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire After SATIN questionnaire authors allowing, we created a specific questionnaire&#xD;
      with all original questions and some additional on workplaces and demographics' data. In&#xD;
      first question, participants must check that they met inclusion criteria and accept to be&#xD;
      included in this survey. An open question was available at the end for remarks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      86 questions in 6 parts: 1. Personnel and Professional Identification (10 questions) 2.&#xD;
      Health reports (16 questions) 3. Work strain and capacities (8 questions) 4. Working&#xD;
      environment (39 questions) 5. Work assessment (4 questions) 6. Supplementary questions for&#xD;
      occupational physician (9 questions) Each question had five possible answers and each answer&#xD;
      is linked to a specific score. Mean of scores were calculated in each part of the&#xD;
      questionnaire: health reports (physical health, psychic health, physical symptoms,&#xD;
      psycho-somatic symptoms, and stress), work strain and ability, working environment (physical&#xD;
      environment, activity, framework of activities and organizational context), self-assessed&#xD;
      work conditions in their entirety. The scores of each part were interpreted as follows: &lt;2.5&#xD;
      poor health or negative perception, 2.5-3.5 mild health or perception, &gt; 3.5 good health or&#xD;
      positive perception. Global health and general workplace environment self-evaluation were&#xD;
      scored in a second time with respectively health reports and working environment scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data were self-reported by the participants including occupation, sexe&#xD;
      (male/female), age (&lt;34, 35-44, 45-54, &gt;55 years), time at workplace (&lt;5, 6-15, 16-26,&gt;26&#xD;
      years), shift work or night work (never, rarely, regularly, often/very often).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses. Data analysis was performed using R software (R Foundation for&#xD;
      Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). The results for continuous variables were shown as&#xD;
      medians with Interquartile range (IQRs). The ranked data, which were ranked from each part of&#xD;
      the questionnaire, are presented as numbers and percentages. Participants were divided into&#xD;
      three groups according to the previously reported questionnaire cut-off (&lt;2.5; 2.5-3.5; &gt;&#xD;
      3.5). Doctor, nurse, medical student, nurse assistant, midwife, paramedics, physiotherapist&#xD;
      and radiographer were included in the subgroup &quot;health care worker&quot;, other participants were&#xD;
      included in the subgroup &quot;non healthcare worker&quot;. We also made an analysis by subgroup of&#xD;
      workers if they regularly or not worked in a COVID 19 dedicated sector. A multinomial&#xD;
      logistic regression analysis was performed and the associations between risk factors and&#xD;
      outcomes are presented as Odds Ratio (ORs) and 95% Confidence Intervals (Cis), after&#xD;
      adjustment for cofounders including, gender, age, years at workplace. The significant level&#xD;
      was set at p= 0.05.&#xD;
