      This is a proposal to conduct a pilot study to assess the feasibility of recruitment of&#xD;
      Veteran smoker and support person (SP) dyads and study procedures in preparation for a large&#xD;
      randomized pragmatic trial. Enhancing access and use of evidence-based tobacco cessation&#xD;
      treatments and eliminating tobacco-related health disparities are top national and VA health&#xD;
      services priorities. The prevalence of tobacco use is greater among Veterans compared to&#xD;
      non-Veterans. From 2010-2015, 28.9% of women and 21.1% of male Veterans reported current&#xD;
      cigarette smoking. Because our prior VHA trials enrolled about 94% men and the higher smoking&#xD;
      rates among women, we will examine the feasibility of recruitment of an equal number of men&#xD;
      and women Veteran smokers in this pilot study. Evidence-based cessation treatments (EBCTs)&#xD;
      such as, tobacco quitlines, behavioral counseling, and pharmacotherapy, are greatly&#xD;
      underutilized by Veteran smokers. This pilot project is innovative for evaluating social&#xD;
      support networks as a proactive outreach approach to enhance cessation treatment utilization&#xD;
      among Veteran smokers. The role of social network influences and social support on successful&#xD;
      smoking cessation is established. Based on Cohen's theory of social support, our team&#xD;
      developed a social support intervention for diverse family members, friends, and other adults&#xD;
      who wanted to help a smoker quit. The intervention consists of written materials and a&#xD;
      1-call, 15-25 minute coaching session. The intervention goal is for support persons (SPs) to&#xD;
      encourage their smoker to use EBCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct a randomized pilot trial within the national VHA health system to evaluate&#xD;
      the feasibility of recruitment of smoker-SP dyads and other study procedures. Veteran&#xD;
      smokers, regardless of level of readiness to quit, will be identified nationally using the&#xD;
      VHA electronic health record (EHR) data base and proactively recruited. Interested smokers&#xD;
      will be asked to identify a SP who will enroll. Participants will be randomized as smoker-SP&#xD;
      dyads to the intervention (n= 15 dyads) or control condition (n= 15 dyads). All smoker&#xD;
      participants will receive written resources and information on evidence-based cessation&#xD;
      treatments. All SP participants will receive written materials. SP participants assigned to&#xD;
      the intervention group will additionally receive a 1-call coaching session. Assessments for&#xD;
      dyads in both study groups will be conducted at baseline and at 3-months post-randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our specific aims are to: (Aim 1) To assess the feasibility of recruitment of 30 Veteran&#xD;
      smoker-SP dyads including enrollment of an equal number of men and women Veterans; and (Aim&#xD;
      2) To evaluate the feasibility of biochemical verification of the smoker's abstinence at&#xD;
      1-month follow-up using a remote collection method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the project is successful, we will have a blueprint for conducting a large randomized&#xD;
      pragmatic trial. Preliminary data will be incorporated in a grant resubmission to the VA HSR&amp;&#xD;
      D to support the feasibility of recruitment and other study procedures.&#xD;

    <description>We will keep detailed recruitment records to track several variables to characterize the reach of the intervention, including the percent of smokers in our recruitment pool who are reached by mail/phone for an enrollment offer; the percent of reached smokers who are eligible for the intervention based on mail/phone screening; and reasons for ineligibility (e.g., cannot identify an SP). We will also track the percent of reach smokers who identify a SP and the proportion of SPs who are eligible. We will also use recruitment records to calculate intervention adoption, defined as the percent of Veterans and SPs who enroll, as well as the percent of women Veterans enrolled. We will track reasons for enrollment refusal among both smokers and SPs.</description>

    <measure>Smoking abstinence: feasibility of biochemical confirmation using a remote collection method</measure>
    <time_frame>One-month after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Our cessation outcomes follow recent recommendations from an SRNT workgroup that updated definitions and measurement of abstinence in clinical trials of smoking cessation interventions. Self-report of cigarette smoking for the past 7 days, even a puff, will be obtained at one-month follow-up. We will obtain biochemical verification of self-reported smoking abstinence using expired air carbon monoxide (CO). Upon reporting 7-day abstinence, smoker participants will receive by mail the iCO™ Smokerlyzer®, a small, portable, handheld breath CO monitor that connects to a mobile device or tablet. Mobile-phone based CO monitoring and the iCO™ (Bedfont® Scientific Ltd) has been field tested and validated with the traditional Smokerlyzer® Bedfont CO detector.</description>
