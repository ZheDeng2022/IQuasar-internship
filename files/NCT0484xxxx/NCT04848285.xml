      The primary goal of most acute stroke interventions is to restore cerebral blood flow (CBF)&#xD;
      in the affected region and prevent hypoperfusion during early clinical course. Diffuse&#xD;
      optical technology offers a new opportunity for invasive, real time and bedside assessment of&#xD;
      brain function biomarkers, including CBF. However, whether CBF monitoring can identify&#xD;
      patients who are most likely to benefit from therapies is unclear Recently, it was suggested&#xD;
      that the benefit of early mobilization (EM) after stroke on motor recovery may be outweighed&#xD;
      by a deleterious effect on cerebral perfusion if cerebral autoregulation (CA) is impaired.&#xD;
      Hypothetically, EM could improve recovery outcomes after stroke in selected patients based on&#xD;
      CA function. Our objective is to investigate if EM leads to superior motor and functional&#xD;
      outcome after stroke compared to standard care (SC) in selected patients based on optical&#xD;
      biomarkers of CA and evaluate the feasibility of the clinical use of a novel transcranial&#xD;
      optical monitoring system adapted to deliver biomarkers of CA at the bedside. The&#xD;
      investigators designed a randomized controlled, open-labeled trial with blinded assessment of&#xD;
      outcome end-points in a stroke unit of a tertiary stroke center. Patients with an ischemic or&#xD;
      hemorrhagic stroke will be recruited and randomly assigned within 24 hours after symptoms&#xD;
      onset to receive SC alone or EM in addition to SC. All patients will undergo optical&#xD;
      monitoring of CA on admission to the Stroke Unit during the first mobilization. Randomization&#xD;
      will be stratified by stroke severity and type of stroke. Clinical outcome will be assessed&#xD;
      with the Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke (PASS) and modified Rankin scale at 90 days.&#xD;
      Safety outcome will be assessed by recording the incidence of neurological deterioration,&#xD;
      recurrence and falls.&#xD;

      Background: The primary goal of most acute stroke interventions is to restore cerebral blood&#xD;
      flow (CBF) in the affected region and prevent hypoperfusion during early clinical course.&#xD;
      Diffuse optical technology offers a new opportunity for invasive, real time and bedside&#xD;
      assessment of brain function biomarkers, including CBF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, whether CBF monitoring can identify patients who are most likely to benefit from&#xD;
      therapies is unclear. The results of AVERT trial suggested that the benefit of early&#xD;
      mobilization (EM) after stroke on functional outcome may be outweighed by a hypothetical&#xD;
      deleterious effect on cerebral perfusion if cerebral autoregulation (CA) is impaired. EM&#xD;
      could improve recovery outcomes after stroke in selected patients based on the status of CA&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: 1) to investigate if EM leads to superior motor and functional outcome after&#xD;
      stroke compared to standard care (SC) in selected patients based on optical biomarkers of CA.&#xD;
      2) To evaluate the feasibility of the clinical use of a novel transcranial optical monitoring&#xD;
      system adapted to deliver biomarkers of CA at the bedside.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: A randomized controlled, open-labeled trial with blinded assessment of outcome&#xD;
      end-points in a stroke unit of a tertiary stroke center. Patients with an ischemic or&#xD;
      hemorrhagic stroke will be randomly assigned within 24 hours after symptoms onset to receive&#xD;
      SC alone or EM in addition to SC. All patients will undergo optical monitoring of CA on&#xD;
      admission to the Stroke Unit. Randomization will be stratified according to stroke severity&#xD;
      measured with the National institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and type of stroke&#xD;
      (ischemic or hemorrhagic). Clinical outcome will be assessed with the Postural Assessment&#xD;
      Scale for Stroke (PASS) and modified Rankin scale at 90 days. Safety outcome will be assessed&#xD;
      by recording the incidence of neurological deterioration, recurrence and falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: to provide a new in vivo biomarker of cerebrovascular function for more&#xD;
      accurate and earlier prediction of response to therapy, leading to improved clinical&#xD;
      decisions and outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>Balance and mobility assessed with the Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke patients (PASS), in its validated Spanish version. The PASS contains 12 four-level items of varying difficulty for assessing ability to maintain or change a given lying, sitting, or standing posture. Each item is scored from 0 to 3, with 0 being the lowest level of functionality and 3 the highest. The total score ranges from 0 to 36 (highest score best).</description>
