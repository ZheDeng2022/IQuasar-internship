  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, open-label study evaluating the performance of the REAL&#xD;
      INTELLIGENCE™ Tensioner as an accessory to the CORI™ Surgical System at approximately 2&#xD;
      centers across the United States. Eighty patients who are eligible for a robotic TKA&#xD;
      procedure with the CORI Surgical System will be followed for approximately 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The REAL INTELLIGENCE™ Tensioner is an accessory to REAL INTELLIGENCE™ CORI™ Surgical System.&#xD;
      The Tensioner may be used to assist the surgeon in providing consistent varus and valgus&#xD;
      stress during gap assessment before making any bony resections. The Tensioner communicates&#xD;
      directly with CORI software, providing automated data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the performance of the Tensioner as an accessory to the&#xD;
      CORI Surgical System by assessing patient satisfaction with the EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level&#xD;
      Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-5D-5L VAS).&#xD;

    <measure>Quality of Life: EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-5D-5L VAS) at 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS records the subject's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale. The endpoints on the scale are labelled &quot;The best health you can imagine&quot; and &quot;The worst health you can imagine&quot;. Participants indicate a numerical value from 1-100 where 0 is the worst imaginable health state and 100 is the best imaginable health state. The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome as judged by the individual respondents.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life: EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-5D-5L VAS) pre-operative, 6 weeks, and 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-operative, 6 weeks, and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS records the subject's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale. The endpoints on the scale are labelled &quot;The best health you can imagine&quot; and &quot;The worst health you can imagine&quot;. Participants indicate a numerical value from 1-100 where 0 is the worst imaginable health state and 100 is the best imaginable health state. The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome as judged by the individual respondents.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life (EQ-5D-5L Index score)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-operative, 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L will be collected at the preoperative visit and at the 6-week, 6-month,&amp; 12-month Follow-Up Visits.&#xD;
The descriptive system is used to describe the subject's health state &amp; consists of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels to choose the most appropriate answer: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. The subject is asked to indicate his/her health state by marking the most appropriate statement in each of the five areas. Responses are coded as single-digit numbers expressing the severity level selected in each dimension. For instance, 'slight problems' (e.g. 'I have slight problems in walking about') is always coded as '2'. The digits for the 5 dimensions are combined in a 5-digit code. The EQ- 5D-5L index value is derived by using the vendor supplied calculator to convert each 5-digit EQ-5D-5L profile. A higher number is a better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>2011 Knee Society Score (KSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-operative, 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 2011 KSS will be collected at the preoperative visit and at the 6-week, 6-month, and 12-month Follow-Up Visits.&#xD;
The KSS is a validated tool that combines an objective physician-derived component with a subjective subject-derived component and consists of 4 separate sub-scales:&#xD;
An &quot;Objective&quot; Knee Score (seven items: 100 points)&#xD;
A Patient Satisfaction Score (five items: 40 points)&#xD;
A Patient Expectation Score (three items: 15 points)&#xD;
A Functional Knee Score (19 items: 100 points)&#xD;
The Functional Knee Score is derived from assessments of walking and standing, standard activities, advanced activities, and discretionary activities. A higher number is a better outcome.</description>
