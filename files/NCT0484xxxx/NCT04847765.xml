  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous research by TARGID (KU Leuven) has demonstrated the feasibility to assess gastric&#xD;
      content volume by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) while simultaneously evaluating&#xD;
      gastric motor function by means of an isovolumetric balloon technique. This and other&#xD;
      research concluded that in general, the motility readout of the isovolumetric balloon is&#xD;
      associated with gastric contractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the exact relation between individual gastric contractions and individual&#xD;
      intraballoon pressure waves remains incompletely understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simultaneous assessment of gastric motility by means of an isovolumetric balloon and dynamic&#xD;
      cine-MRI can validate that slow, high-amplitude intraballoon pressure waves are indeed&#xD;
      induced by gastric muscle contractions. This evaluation might also enable us to attribute&#xD;
      artefacts present in the pressure signal to physiologic processes such as cardiac,&#xD;
      respiratory, intestinal and whole-body movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date substantial uncertainty exists on the optimal procedural approach to evaluate gastric&#xD;
      motility simultaneously with cine-MRI and the isovolumetric balloon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this pilot study is to verify the feasibility of a several aspects of a larger&#xD;
      confirmatory study protocol. This includes the evaluation of contrast of the balloon catheter&#xD;
      on MRI (this would omit the need for radiographic confirmation), timelines, practical&#xD;
      hurdles, analysis procedures and data management.&#xD;

    <description>The VIPUN Balloon Catheter prototype is a nasogastric feeding tube with integrated balloon that can be inflated with a preset volume of air. Intraballoon pressure changes are recorded outside the body. Gastric contractions can be detected in the pressure profile.&#xD;
The recording lasts 30 minutes and is combined with simultaneous cine magnetic resonance imaging.</description>
