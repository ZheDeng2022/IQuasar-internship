    <textblock>
      Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) is effective and safe for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) caused&#xD;
      by large vessel occlusion (LVO) in major clinical trials. Whether the benefit of EVT in&#xD;
      randomized trials could be generalized to clinical practice, especially in developing&#xD;
      countries, remains unknown. The Registry was established to evaluate the utilization, and&#xD;
      subsequent outcomes of EVT treated AIS patients. This study is a multi-center, prospective&#xD;
      registry study initiated by researchers, to investigate Reco ® ,the first clot retriever in&#xD;
      china as the primary therapyand remedies in the real world.&#xD;

    <description>EQ-5D is a standardized instrument for measuring generic health status. Rated level can be coded as a number 1, 2, or 3, which indicates having no problems for 1, having some problems for 2, and having extreme problems for 3. As a result, a person's health status can be defined by a 5-digit number, ranging from 11111 (having no problems in all dimensions) to 33333 (having extreme problems in all dimensions).A higher score indicates a better outcome.</description>
