  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-arm, cluster randomized trial designed to to evaluate the effectiveness of an&#xD;
      e-cigarette curriculum [called the CATCH My Breath (CMB) program] in delaying the onset of&#xD;
      e-cigarette use in middle schoolers. Schools will be assigned to either the CMB program or&#xD;
      usual care, which is Texas Education Agency (TEA) required tobacco prevention program. 10&#xD;
      schools will be assigned to each arm arm, and each school will include 70 students in the&#xD;
      study, for a total of 700 students per arm and 1400 total students in the study. Both&#xD;
      programs will be administered to participating students over 3 years.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to empirically assess the three year immediate effects and 12&#xD;
      year follow-up of the CATCH My Breath (CMB) program on delaying the onset of e-cigarette use&#xD;
      with a 6th-9th grade cohort, using a 20-school group randomized controlled trial (RCT), with&#xD;
      1,400 students. E-cigarettes are the most commonly used tobacco product by US youth. Recent&#xD;
      research, strongly suggests that youth who only smoke e-cigarettes exhibit symptoms of&#xD;
      addiction, and are more likely to experiment combustible tobacco. Unfortunately, few&#xD;
      e-cigarette prevention programs exist, and none have been tested for longer-term efficacy.&#xD;
      Although some tobacco prevention programs have included an e-cigarette add -on component, to&#xD;
      our knowledge, none of these revised programs have been formally evaluated. The lack of&#xD;
      e-cigarette specific program content, and lack of rigorous evaluation, warrants the proposed&#xD;
      project. CMB was developed with input from school administrators, health education&#xD;
      coordinators, tobacco prevention educators, classroom teachers, students, and parents. CMB&#xD;
      has been formatively evaluated and pilot tested at 59 middle schools in 7 states, resulting&#xD;
      in positive feedback from over 100 middle school teachers and 9,578 6th-8th grade students.&#xD;
      Our second pilot pretest-posttest controlled experiment (2017-2018), and resulted in an&#xD;
      treatment-control difference of 3.8% in ever smoking over a 16-month period. Given CMB's&#xD;
      current popularity with schools as a 'best practice' program, and with initial positive&#xD;
      results, a full scale randomized control trial is needed to determine longer term, 6th-9th&#xD;
      grade efficacy.&#xD;

    <description>The CMB curriculum is divided into four developmentally appropriate e-cigarette lessons (approximately 20-30 minutes each) for middle school aged youth (6th - 8th grade). A variety of educational strategies are used and include cooperative learning groups, large group discussions, interviews, role-play, media, reports, and goal setting. CMB will provide study materials to teachers and schools through a state-of-the art online delivery portal. A site-based management team will oversee program implementation. Teachers will be trained via webinar. Project staff will visit all participating schools to assemble and train the CATCH site-based management team, and answer questions about the study. Teachers in CMB intervention schools will be provided with CMB-specific training for implementing the lessons with fidelity through a one-hour live webinar with Dr. Kelder, which will be offered at multiple times to accommodate teaching schedules.</description>
