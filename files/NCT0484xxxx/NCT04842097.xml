    <masking_description>It is not possible to blind the participants to group allocation due to the nature of the mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention; however, the outcome assessor, who will administer the outcome questionnaires to the participants will be blinded to the participants' group allocation as well the investigator and the data analyst who will conduct the analysis ensuring neutrality of the outcome assessment.</masking_description>

    <description>Change in 8 health-related quality of life domains as measured by the PROMIS 29. PROMIS-29 is a generic patient reported outcome measure, which includes four items from each of the seven PROMIS domains (physical function, depression, anxiety, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and ability to participate in social roles and activities, pain interference) and a single item on pain intensity. Each item has five response options (values 1 to 5), except for the pain intensity item which has eleven response options (values 0 to 10). A total raw score is computed for each domain as the sum of the response to each question within the domain, leading to seven domain scores, each from 4 to 20.</description>

    <description>The French-Canadian Chronic Pain Self-Efficacy Scale (Lacasse et al., 2015) is a 6-item scale that measures an individual's confidence in his/her ability to manage chronic pain in general and pain-related symptoms. Items are rated on a 10-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = not at all confident to 10 = entirely confident. Score range is 6-60 with higher scores reflecting greater chronic pain self-efficacy.</description>

    <description>The Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire (CPAQ-8; Fish et al., 2010 ) is an 8-item scale comprised of two subscales: activity engagement and pain willingness. Items are scored on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 0 = never true to 6 = always true. Score range is 0-48 with increases in scores meaning better outcome.</description>

    <description>The Global Change Rating Scale (11-point visual analogue scale raging from minus 5 to plus 5) will be used to assess the participants' perception of improvement (or decline) in relation to their self-efficacy in manging pain at the end of the MBSR intervention.</description>

    <description>Change in pain catastrophizing as measured by the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (French Canadian version). PCS is a 13-item measure using a 5-point Likert scale (0=not at all, 4=all the time) with score range between 0-52 with decreases in scores meaning better outcome.</description>

    <description>An online mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention will be administered in a group format of maximum 15 participants, once a week for 120 minutes for 8 weeks by an experienced therapist trained in MBSR. Sessions will include sitting and lying meditation, hatha yoga and a body scan where attention is sequentially focused on different parts of the body. Individual autonomous practice between 30-45 minutes, 6 times / week will also be recommended. To support individual autonomous practice, a daily diary and two guided videos (around 35 minutes/each) were created.</description>
