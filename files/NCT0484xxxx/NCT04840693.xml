  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The excess of glucocorticoid, whether endogenous or exogenous, results in Cushing's syndrome,&#xD;
      associating a particular distribution of fats (accumulation in the face and trunk), a&#xD;
      decrease in the thickness of the muscles, diabetes, hypertension or osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The level of effects obviously depends on the extent of the excess glucocorticoids, and on&#xD;
      the duration of this exposure. However, the manifestations of Cushing's syndrome also depend&#xD;
      very much on the sensitivity of each individual to glucocorticoids for each of these&#xD;
      conditions. Indeed, for the same duration and level of exposure, some will have diabetes&#xD;
      only, others only osteoporosis, others hypertension, while still others will have these three&#xD;
      complications. Today the investigators are unable to specify individual risks. For example,&#xD;
      will someone develop diabetes when exposed to glucocorticoids? Or on the contrary will blood&#xD;
      sugar level remain normal? The same question arises for hypertension and osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The deficiency of glucocorticoid, called adrenal insufficiency, causes fatigue and&#xD;
      discomfort. The intensity of the signs depends on the depth of the insufficiency. Here again,&#xD;
      there is a large variability in the sensitivity of each individual to glucocorticoids: when&#xD;
      one substitutes for adrenal insufficiency at a given dose, some individuals will feel well,&#xD;
      while others will still remain tired. The investigators are unable to specify participant's&#xD;
      individual requirement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this research is to identify factors that determine individual sensitivity to&#xD;
      glucocorticoids. For excess glucocorticoids, the investigators are looking for specific&#xD;
      molecular markers for each type of glucocorticoid complication: markers for&#xD;
      corticosteroid-induced diabetes, corticosteroid-induced hypertension, or&#xD;
      corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For adrenal insufficiency, they are also looking for substitute good balance markers for&#xD;
      adrenal insufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To answer the research question, it is planned to include 400 subjects exposed to&#xD;
      glucocorticoid excess (by excess of endogenous glucocorticoids or induced by corticosteroid&#xD;
      therapy) and 100 subjects with adrenal insufficiency. It is also planned to include 100&#xD;
      subjects without excess glucocorticoids but presenting either diabetes, hypertension or&#xD;
      osteoporosis; these subjects will constitute a control group. The investigators will perform&#xD;
      a very large number of measurements in small amounts of blood and urine, in order to identify&#xD;
      a few marks specifically associated with each of the complications. This research will&#xD;
      identify, for every person exposed to glucocorticoids, the probability of developping some&#xD;
      complications, and reversely the probability of being exempt from other complications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For each participant, easily accessible biological samples will be taken (blood, urine,&#xD;
      saliva). From these samples, a large number of molecular markers will be generated (genomics,&#xD;
      metabolomics), in search of signatures specifically associated with each complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three main types of complications will be analyzed: diabetes, hypertension and osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis is planned in 4 stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify markers for each type of complication in the context of excess frank&#xD;
           glucocorticoids, by comparing affected patients and those not affected for each type of&#xD;
           complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subtraction of non-specific markers of diabetes, hypertension and osteoporosis,&#xD;
           identified by the analysis of diabetic, hypertensive and osteoporotic patients who do&#xD;
           not have excess glucocorticoids&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test the performance of these markers in an independent cohort of patients presenting an&#xD;
           excess of glucocorticoids at variable levels: frank and at least (endogenous, exogenous)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test the performance of these markers in a cohort of patients with substituted adrenal&#xD;
           insufficiency&#xD;
