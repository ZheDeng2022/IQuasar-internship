    <description>Covid-19 Fear Scale: The scale developed by Ahorsu et al. (2020) was adapted to Turkish by Bakioglu, Korkmaz and Ercan (2020). The scale, consisting of seven questions, is a 5-point Likert (1: Strongly disagree, 5: Strongly agree) type. The scale consists of one dimension. The scores that can be obtained from the scale range from 7 to 35. The total score obtained from all items of the scale reflects the level of Covid-19 fear experienced by the individual. A high score means experiencing a high level of fear.</description>

    <measure>Information Form</measure>
    <time_frame>November-March</time_frame>
    <description>The form consists of two parts. In the first part, there are 14 questions that determine the socio-demographic characteristics of the students (age, gender, class, family type, mother education, father education, monthly income level, knowledge about Covid-19, information source, catching Covid-19, family's catching Covid-19, worrying about the family in terms of the illness, thinking that they can be protected from Covid-19 and being knowledgeable about the methods of protection from Covid-19). In the second part, the practices of students on protection methods from Covid-19 were prepared within the framework of mask (14 questions), hand washing (8 questions) and social distance (17 questions) measures. No scoring will be made in this section. Students' compliance with protective measures will be evaluated as &quot;yes&quot; &quot;no&quot; &quot;sometimes&quot;.</description>
