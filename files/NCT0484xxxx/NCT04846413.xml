  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this observational pilot study, the investigators will record and assess voice samples&#xD;
      from healthy participants and those participants affected by neurologic diseases to evaluate&#xD;
      possible differences in voice features.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will evaluate the clinical features of healthy participants&#xD;
      and those participants with neurologic disorders by applying dedicated clinical scales. Also,&#xD;
      the investigators will assess voice impairment by using perceptual examination tools. Then,&#xD;
      the investigators will apply spectral analysis to assess the main frequency components of&#xD;
      voice in healthy participants and in patients affected by neurologic disorders with a&#xD;
      prominent voice impairment. To distinguish between healthy participants and patients affected&#xD;
      by various neurologic diseases, the investigators will apply a voice analysis based on&#xD;
      support vector machine (SVM) classifier that included a large number of features in addition&#xD;
      to the main frequency components of voice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these purposes, the investigators will assess in detail the sensitivity, specificity,&#xD;
      positive predictive value, and negative predictive value and accuracy of all diagnostic&#xD;
      tests. Furthermore, the investigators will calculate the area under the receiver operating&#xD;
      characteristic (ROC) curves to verify the optimal diagnostic threshold as reflected by the&#xD;
      associated criterion (Ass. Crit.) and Youden Index (YI). To assess possible&#xD;
      clinical-instrumental correlations, the investigators will also use a modified algorithm of&#xD;
      SVM analysis to calculate a continuous numerical value (the likelihood ratio [LR]) providing&#xD;
      a measure of voice impairment severity for each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Voice recordings will be performed by asking participants to produce a specific speech task&#xD;
      with their usual voice intensity, pitch, and quality. The speech task will consist of a&#xD;
      sustained emission of a close mid-front unrounded vowel /e/ for at least 5 seconds. Voice&#xD;
      recordings will be collected by using a high-definition audio-recorder placed at a distance&#xD;
      of 5 cm from the mouth. Voice samples will be recorded in linear PCM format (.wav) at a&#xD;
      sampling rate of 44.1 kHz, with 24-bit sample size. Voice analysis will consist of three&#xD;
      separate processes: feature extraction, selection and classification. For feature extraction,&#xD;
      the investigators will use the OpenSMILE (audEERING GmbH, Germany), dedicated software. Then,&#xD;
      the investigators will select and classify voice feature by using SVM algorithm included in&#xD;
      Weka.&#xD;
