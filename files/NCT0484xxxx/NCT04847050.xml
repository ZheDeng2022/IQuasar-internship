  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 is a viral infection. It has spread rapidly across the globe. It has overwhelmed&#xD;
      health systems. Researchers are concerned that it may undo years of progress in the reduction&#xD;
      of cancer-specific death. They want to test a vaccine that might protect people with cancer&#xD;
      from COVID-19. The COVID-19 Vaccine from Moderna has obtained an emergency use authorization&#xD;
      from the FDA. The vaccine has been proven to reduce infections with the virus that causes&#xD;
      COVID-19, and it has already been given to millions of people around the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the safety and efficacy of a vaccine using mRNA-1273 that may protect people with&#xD;
      cancer from COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 and older who have a solid tumor or blood cancer and who may benefit from a&#xD;
&#xD;
      vaccine that might prepare their immune system for fighting and preventing infection from&#xD;
      COVID-19. Patients with solid tumors must be receiving treatment with an immunotherapy agent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history, medicine review, and physical exam.&#xD;
      They will have blood tests. They will have a pregnancy test if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get 2 doses of the mRNA-1273 vaccine. It will be injected into a muscle in&#xD;
      the arm on Days 1 and 29. Participants will have a follow-up phone call on Day 8 after the&#xD;
      first dose. They will be followed for 12 months after the second dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have study visits at the Clinical Center on Days 1 and 29 to get the&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccine from Moderna. Patients will then be asked to come back for visits about 1&#xD;
      week and 1 month after the second dose. Patients will need to come back for visits 6 months&#xD;
      and 1 year after the second vaccine dose to check to see how long the vaccine offers&#xD;
      protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some visits will last up to a few hours, but most will be significantly shorter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give blood and saliva samples for research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last about 13 months.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer patients are at increased risk from COVID-19 infection fatality due to underlying&#xD;
      malignancy, treatment-related immunosuppression, or increased number of comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In solid tumor patients, treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitor has been considered a&#xD;
      potential predictor for severe disease. Similarly, patients with hematologic malignancies&#xD;
      (acute leukemia, lymphoma, stem cell transplant) are the most immunosuppressed among all&#xD;
      cancer patients and are known to have an increased risk for complications associated other&#xD;
      respiratory viral infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ModernaTX, Inc. is using its mRNA-based technology to develop a novel lipid nanoparticle&#xD;
      (LNP)-encapsulated messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 (mRNA-1273).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary clinical data from 1273 phase I study indicates that all 45 patients tested at&#xD;
      doses 25, 100 and 200 mcg demonstrated antibodies after one dose and that 8 volunteers had&#xD;
      neutralizing antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently reported data shows that mRNA-1273 induces both potent neutralizing antibody and CD8&#xD;
      T cell responses and protects against SARS-CoV-2 infection in lungs and noses of mice without&#xD;
      evidence of immunopathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of the mRNA-1273 vaccine administered in 2 doses,&#xD;
      28 days apart, in participants who have a hematological malignancy and are immunosuppressed&#xD;
      due to their disease and/or treatment, or receiving a PD-1/PDL-1 inhibitor for treatment of a&#xD;
      solid tumor for patients who are vaccine-naive&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a booster dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine administered&#xD;
      to patients who have previously received an mRNA or alternative vaccine regime in patients&#xD;
      who have a hematological malignancy and are immunosuppressed due to their disease and/or&#xD;
      treatment, or receiving a PD-1/PDL-1 inhibitor for treatment of a solid tumor for patients&#xD;
      who are vaccine-naive&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a booster dose of mRNA-1273 administered to&#xD;
      patients with CLL who are either off treatment or are engaging in a 3-week BTK inhibitor&#xD;
      interruption to enhance vaccine immunogenicity&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccine, mRNA-1273 in patients with cancer, as&#xD;
      assessed by the titer or level of specific binding antibody (bAb), in participants who have a&#xD;
      hematological malignancy and are immunosuppressed due to their disease and/or treatment, or&#xD;
      receiving a PD-1/PDL-1 inhibitor for treatment of a solid tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the immunogenicity of the mRNA-1273 vaccine administered in 2 doses 28 days&#xD;
      apart, as assessed by the titer or level of neutralizing antibody (nAb) in the vaccine-naive&#xD;
      cohorts&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the immunogenicity of a booster dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine administered to&#xD;
      patients who have previously been vaccinated against SARS-CoV2 with any prior vaccine&#xD;
      regimen. as assessed by the titer or level of neutralizing antibody (nAb)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess immune responses against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and spike proteins&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate salivary measurement of IgG&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumor; or confirmed&#xD;
      diagnosis of acute leukemia (myeloid (AML) or lymphoid (ALL); multiple myeloma; or lymphoma,&#xD;
      or post allogeneic stem cell transplantation (for any indication)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age &gt;18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with known history of SARS-CoV-2 infection or within 14 days of known exposure&#xD;
      to someone with known SARS CoV2 infection COVD-19 are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who have had prior administration of an investigational coronavirus (e.g.&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV) vaccine are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with known hypotension, uncontrolled chronic pulmonary or cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with a history of anaphylaxis, urticaria, or other significant adverse reaction&#xD;
      after receipt of vaccine are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label, multicenter, phase II, clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 220 subjects will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the vaccine naive cohorts we plan to enroll 20 participants with solid tumor malignancies&#xD;
      who have initiated PD1/PDL1 inhibitor therapy as part of standard of care and are deemed to&#xD;
      have a stable regimen without the need for any immunosuppressive therapy or corticosteroids&#xD;
      (beyond physiologic dosing, if needed) and 60 participants with leukemia, lymphoma, multiple&#xD;
      myeloma and patients post-allogeneic stem cell transplant. Participants will be enrolled&#xD;
      based on their perceived risk of immunosuppression. Subjects will receive an IM injection&#xD;
      (0.5 mL) of mRNA-1273 on Days 1 and 29 in the deltoid muscle and will be followed through 12&#xD;
      months post second vaccination (Day 394).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the vaccine booster cohorts we plan to enroll 20 participants with solid tumor&#xD;
      malignancies who have inititated PD1/PDL1 treatment, 20 participants with lymphocytic&#xD;
      leukemia who are not on therapy, 20 participants with lymphocytic leukemia who are on BTK&#xD;
      inhibitor therapy, 30 participants on CART cell therapy, 20 participants post allogeneic stem&#xD;
      cell transplant, 20 participants with other hematologic malignancies and 10 participants with&#xD;
      any solid tumor. Subjects will receive an IM injection (0.5 mL) of mRNA-1273 on Day 1 in the&#xD;
      deltoid muscle and will be followed through 12 months post vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the entire study is anticipated to be 16 months (from start of screening to&#xD;
      last subject last visit).&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Intravaginal hormonal contraceptive rings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        At least 1 barrier method. Effective barrier methods for use in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female condom.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diaphragm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creams or gels that contain a chemical to kill sperm&#xD;
&#xD;
        If a female patient has a male partner who has had surgery to prevent pregnancy&#xD;
        (vasectomy), that will be considered evidence of effective contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CLL participants undergoing BTKi treatment interruption: Must be receiving treatment&#xD;

                  interstitial lung disease (ILD), serious chronic gastrointestinal conditions&#xD;
                  associated with diarrhea, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would&#xD;
                  limit compliance with study requirement, substantially increase risk of incurring&#xD;
                  AEs, or compromise the ability of the patient to give written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Active tuberculosis (clinical evaluation that includes clinical history, physical&#xD;
                  examination and radiographic findings, and tuberculosis testing in line with&#xD;
