  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitiligo affects 1 to 2% of worldwide population and has a demonstrated impact on the quality&#xD;
      of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optimal treatment of vitiligo requires to target the auto-immune inflammatory response (to&#xD;
      halt the depigmentation process), in particular T cells, but also to induce the&#xD;
      differentiation of melanocyte stem cells (to induce repigmentation). Ultimately, the&#xD;
      treatment should also prevent the recurrences of depigmentation. Indeed, when repigmentation&#xD;
      is achieved, 40 to 50% of lesions reoccur within one year, suggesting that skin resident&#xD;
      memory T cell clones remain in repigmented vitiligo skin and might explain these recurrences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that a very early intervention could prevent the accumulation&#xD;
      of the skin resident memory T cells in vitiligo lesions. Moreover, they also think that such&#xD;
      an early treatment would also optimize the repigmentation process, even in traditionally&#xD;
      resistant areas, as some remaining pre-melanocytes and maybe even some melanocytes, could&#xD;
      proliferate and recolonize the epidermis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives : to compare the resident memory T-cell infiltrate in perilesional vitiligo skin&#xD;
      after 6 months of treatment with OMP and UVB, between three groups of patients suffering from&#xD;
      non-segmental vitiligo Interventions The 3 groups will receive a combination of narrowband&#xD;
      UVB (Nb-UVB) 3 times a week and oral mini pulses of systemic steroids (5 mg of d medrol 16mg&#xD;
      twice a week) for 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three visits will be done (inclusion, Week 12 and 24) A skin biopsy will be done on lesional&#xD;
      and peri-lesional area at baseline. Another skin biopsy will be taken after 24 weeks but only&#xD;
      in perilesional area. A blood sample for assessing the circulating memory T cells and for&#xD;
      checking the tolerance will be performed at baseline, then at W12 and W24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of narrowband UVB and oral minipulse of steroids are considered as a standard&#xD;
      care of active vitiligo patients. Clinical assessment (including blood pressure) and&#xD;
      hemogram, liver enzymes, urea, creatinemia, glycemia, natremia and kaliema will be assessed&#xD;
      at baseline, 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main criteria of evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target lesion will be chosen before any treatment. The minimal size will be 2cm².&#xD;
      Considering that skin on the face usually responds very well whilst that of hands and feet&#xD;
      respond poorly, to avoid potential bias due to the location of treatment, these locations&#xD;
      won't be taken as target lesions. In any cases, no biopsy will be taken on the face or in the&#xD;
      folds.&#xD;
