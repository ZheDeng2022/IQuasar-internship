  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study about the comparison of post-operative results of secondary alveolar grafts according&#xD;
      to two age groups: early secondary (4 to 7 years) versus late secondary (8 to 11 years) using&#xD;
      a recently proposed score based on post-operative 3D CT analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of the initial results of the graft in the two groups, with a reference 2D score&#xD;
      and evaluation of the concordance between the results found with this score and those of the&#xD;
      3D score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, comparison of graft bone densities and nasal floor level (using 3D visualization) on&#xD;
      post-operative TDMs in the 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine the optimal age for grafting using three-dimensional CT&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;

    <measure>Kamperos's score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Kamperos's score (a post-operative tri-dimensional scanographic score) This score includes 3 items measured on the post-operative CT: graft bone thickness (0 to 2), bone graft height (0 to 4) and nasal floor height (0 to 4).&#xD;
A total score of 0 to 8 is considered a failure and 9 to 10 a success</description>
