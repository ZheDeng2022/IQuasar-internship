  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has been no study yet on the effect of stingless bee honey (Kelulut honey) produced by&#xD;
      Melipolini sp. in diabetic wound healing in Malaysia. Kelulut honey, apart from possessing&#xD;
      similar pro-healing properties with other honey, is also found to have a better antioxidant&#xD;
      capacity, anti-inflammatory, and free radical scavenging activity than Tualang honey. These&#xD;
      effects are due to the much higher content of phenolic and flavonoid substances in Kelulut&#xD;
      honey, the key bioactive factors promoting wound healing and preventing oxidative&#xD;
      stress-related injury. Australian researchers have also recently discovered a novel source of&#xD;
      the rare disaccharide trehalose in stingless bee's honey, which is highly anti-diabetic and&#xD;
      antioxidating. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of honey against gel dressing for&#xD;
      wound bed preparation among diabetic patients.&#xD;

    <description>The honey will be acquired from Brainey Sdn Bhd, a company that provides stingless bee honey certified with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), ISO 22000, and Halal.&#xD;
As the honey used is not medical-grade honey, sterilization with 25kGy gamma-ray irradiation will be done for safety purposes to eradicate any potential life-threatening infection such as spores from Clostridium botulinum.</description>
