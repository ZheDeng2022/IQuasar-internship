  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I trial evaluating the safety of personalized radiation therapy based on&#xD;
      levels of hypoxia identified on FMISO-PET and MRI. All patients will receive a baseline FMISO&#xD;
      PET and MRI to identify levels of hypoxia. Patients with tumor hypoxia will receive a higher&#xD;
      dose of radiation therapy. Subjects who do not have hypoxic tumors will be treated with the&#xD;
      standard-of-care radiation regimen. After fraction 10 of radiation therapy, an additional MRI&#xD;
      will be performed. If this interim MRI demonstrates little or no response (as defined in&#xD;
      Section 6), an optional boost radiation dose can be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial enrollment will be conducted in two parts. In Part 1, eight patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
      After all eight patients have completed the 30 day DLT period, enrollment will be placed on&#xD;
      hold and safety will be evaluated. During the interim analysis, one additional patient will&#xD;
      be allowed to be enrolled in the trial. If the trial meets stopping rules as described in&#xD;
      Section 11.3, the trial will be re-evaluated by the DSMC and the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
      However, if the rate of DLTs remains below the unacceptable toxicity rate, enrollment will&#xD;
      open to the enrollment of eight more patients.&#xD;

If there is no uptake seen on the FMISO-PET scan, tumors will be labeled not hypoxic. Subjects with tumors identified by imaging as hypoxic will be treated with a higher dose of radiation therapy. Tumors will be defined as being hypoxic if FMISO accumulation occurs as demonstrated by SUV uptake in the tumor.</description>
