  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuroblastoma is an embryonal tumor originated from primitive neural crest cells. It is the&#xD;
      most common extracranial solid tumor in children. It is characterized by abundant blood&#xD;
      vessels, rapid growth and early metastasis.With the gradual improvement of diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment technology, the survival rate of children with Neuroblastoma in China has been&#xD;
      increasing year by year, but the Overall Survival is still lower than that in European and&#xD;
      American countries, so new and efficient treatment methods are urgently needed in clinical&#xD;
      practice.Anti-angiogenesis target therapy is an important component of the malignant tumor&#xD;
      treatment, hydrochloric acid for Anlotinib has the anti-tumor angiogenesis and suppress tumor&#xD;
      growth, Anlotinib currently in thyroid carcinoma, esophageal cancer, liver cancer, colorectal&#xD;
      cancer, soft nest, cervical cancer, soft tissue sarcoma and so on the many kinds of cancer&#xD;
      are conducting clinical trials, but in neuroblastoma application has not been reported.The&#xD;
      purpose of this study was to explore the therapeutic effect and mechanism of Anlotinib and&#xD;
      irinotecan combined with temozolomide in the treatment of refractory or recurrent&#xD;
      Neuroblastoma in children.Neuroblastoma is an embryonal tumor originated from primitive&#xD;
      neural crest cells. It is the most common extracranial solid tumor in children. It is&#xD;
      characterized by abundant blood vessels, rapid growth and early metastasis.It accounts for&#xD;
      8%-10% of all malignant tumors in children, with an annual incidence of 0.3-5.5/100,000.The&#xD;
      prognosis of Neuroblastoma was closely related to age at diagnosis, clinical stage, tumor&#xD;
      pathological type, N-myc gene copy number and DNA index.According to the above five&#xD;
      indicators, the Children's Oncology Group divided NB into low, medium and high risk&#xD;
      groups.According to the 2013 Children's Oncology Group data, the current 5-year Overall&#xD;
      Survival of low - and moderate-risk Neuroblastoma patients was 90%, while the Overall&#xD;
      Survival of high-risk patients was only 50%.The current treatment of Neuroblastoma is a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary combination of surgery, chemoradiotherapy and autologous stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation.With the gradual improvement of diagnosis and treatment technology, the&#xD;
      survival rate of children with NB in China has been increasing year by year, but the Overall&#xD;
      Survival is still lower than that in European and American countries, so new and efficient&#xD;
      treatment methods are urgently needed in clinical practice.&#xD;
