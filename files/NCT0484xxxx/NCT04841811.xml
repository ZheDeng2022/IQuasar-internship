    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open phase II clinical study, in patients with unresectable stage III&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer,to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Almonertinib induction&#xD;
      therapy, and ,to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different treatment decisions&#xD;
      guided by ctDNA dynamic monitoring after local treatments (surgical or radical radiotherapy)&#xD;
      evaluated by MDT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes a screening period (not more than 28 days after the subject signs informed&#xD;
      consent to before the first medication), treatment period (including induction\MDT+topical&#xD;
      therapy\adjuvant or consolidation therapy) and follow-up period (including safety and&#xD;

&#xD;
      Eligible subjects received 110 mg of Almonertinib once a day for 8 consecutive weeks of&#xD;
      induction therapy; local treatment (surgical or radical radiotherapy) was selected after MDT&#xD;
      assessment. In patients with no disease progression after Almonertinib treatment for 2 years,&#xD;
      it is up to the investigator to decide whether to continue taking the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operable subjects were randomly assigned to groups A and B after surgery: Group A received&#xD;
      110 mg of Almonertinib once a day for 2 years, and Group B received Almonertinib ctDNA&#xD;
      dynamic monitoring guided treatment (every 3 months test ctDNA once, if it is positive,&#xD;
      continue to receive Almonertinib 110 mg once a day, if it is negative, stop Almonertinib&#xD;
      until ctDNA turns positive and receive Almonertinib treatment again).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inoperable subjects were randomly assigned to groups C and D after radical radiotherapy.&#xD;
      Group C continued to receive Almonertinib 110 mg once a day for 2 years, and group D received&#xD;
