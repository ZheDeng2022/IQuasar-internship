  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      iReadMore will provide an app-based therapy for people with pure or central alexia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to test the clinical effectiveness of iReadMore for improving reading&#xD;
      accuracy and speed in real world users of the therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      iReadMore is a self-led therapy app for improving single word reading accuracy and speed in&#xD;
      individuals with acquired reading impairments. iReadMore has been demonstrated to improve&#xD;
      reading speed and accuracy in pure and central alexias (Woodhead et al., 2013, 2018).&#xD;
      iReadMore therapy is not expected to improve reading for the remaining alexia subtypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iReadMore includes 590 of the most frequently written words from the SUBTLEX lexical database&#xD;
      (Brysbaert and New, 2009). High frequency words were chosen to maximise the relevance&#xD;
      (ecological utility) of the training to everyday life. The therapy mechanism relies on mass&#xD;
      practice of cross-modal, paired associate learning (Holcomb and Anderson, 1993) based on the&#xD;
      Triangle Model approach to reading. Untrained words will not be affected, and thus word&#xD;
      reading improvements are not expected to generalise beyond trained items.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapy utilises gamification and is designed to be accessible in order to drive&#xD;
      motivation and engagement for the user group. iReadMore is downloadable via the Google Play&#xD;
      store on Android tablet devices. iReadMore is a CE-marked class 1 medical device that was&#xD;
      developed by the Neurotherapeutics Group, University College London.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An online roll-out trial will be conducted to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of&#xD;
      iReadMore with a study population of real world users. The therapy will be evaluated in a&#xD;
      clinical population with a reading impairment of any acquired cause (such as stroke or brain&#xD;
      injury). Participants will self-enrol in the study through the app, which has been&#xD;
      co-designed to ensure accessibility to this user group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A within-participant evaluation of trained versus untrained items will investigate the&#xD;
      clinical effectiveness of the therapy for improving reading speed and accuracy. The primary&#xD;
      outcomes are improvements in single word reading accuracy and speed. Interval testing will be&#xD;
      conducted after every 5 hours of therapy. The secondary outcomes are self-reported Activities&#xD;
      of Daily Living and a series of qualitative questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further analyses will be conducted on alexia subtypes and the influence of therapy dose and&#xD;
      intensity on the therapeutic outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical approval for the iReadMore roll-out trial was obtained from the UCL Research Ethics&#xD;
      Committee (ID: 7609/001).&#xD;

    <measure>Word Reading Test - Change in Reading Accuracy and Speed from baseline to 20 hours</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and after every 5 hours of therapy up to a maximum dose of 50 hours. Primary outcome is change from baseline to 20 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>Change in single word reading accuracy and speed will be assessed in a Word Reading Test (WRT) delivered in the app. At interval tests, the WRT will include both trained and untrained words to investigate the treatment-specific effects.</description>

    <measure>Participant-Reported Outcome Measures - Activities of Daily Living (ADL)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and after every 10 hours of therapy up to a maximum dose of 50 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Activities of Daily Living - Participants are asked to rate how easy they find completing a series of everyday tasks, including language and non-language related tasks. Responses are reported using a 7-point Likert scale from 0 to 6 denoting 'Very Easy' to 'Very Hard'.</description>

    <measure>Participant-Reported Outcome Measures - Qualitative Questions</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and after every 10 hours of therapy up to a maximum dose of 50 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Qualitative Questions - participants are also asked three open text questions on their experiences of the therapy and their reading abilities at that point in time.</description>
