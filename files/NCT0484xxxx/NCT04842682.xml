    <textblock>
      Multicenter double-blind placebo controlled phase I dose-escalation trial that will be&#xD;
      conducted in France and Switzerland to evaluate different dose levels of CD40.HIVRI.Env&#xD;
      (adjuvanted with Hiltonol) alone and in co-administration with DNA-HIV-PT123.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 72 eligible healthy participants will be recruited into 6 groups. Within each&#xD;
      group, participants will be randomized in a double blind manner to active intervention or&#xD;
      placebo in a 5:1 ratio. Enrolment into a given group (other than group &quot;Solo 0.3&quot;) will open&#xD;
      sequentially depending on the &quot; go-criterion &quot; based on the safety data of the preceding&#xD;
      group(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess the safety of three dose levels of CD40.HIVRI.Env (0.3; 1;&#xD;
      3 mg) adjuvanted with Poly-ICLC (Hiltonol®), alone and in combination with DNA-HIV-PT123,&#xD;
      administered at weeks 0, 4 and 24 in healthy participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to assess the capacity of poly-ICLC-adjuvanted CD40.HIVRI.Env alone&#xD;
      and in combination with DNA-HIV-PT123 to elicit immune responses against HIV&#xD;
      (immunogenicity):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Humoral (antibody) responses ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  B-cell responses ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T-cell responses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ANRS VRI06 clinical trial follows the prophylactic vaccine strategies developed since the&#xD;
      encouraging results obtained during the RV144 trial. The RV144 study identified binding IgG&#xD;
      antibodies directed at conserved regions of the V1/V2 loop and antibody-dependent&#xD;
      cell-mediated cytotoxicity as immune correlates of reduced risk of HIV infection in the&#xD;
      absence of inhibiting serum IgA antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have developed DC-targeting vaccines, in order to increase protein antigen efficacy&#xD;
      through their selective delivery to dendritic cell (DC), the key cell type for initiating and&#xD;
      regulating immune responses, via the endocytic receptors expressed at the DC surfaces.&#xD;
      Following the screening of vaccines targeting different several DC-receptors, the&#xD;
      CD40-targeting vaccine has been shown to be the best candidate for inducing both cellular and&#xD;
      humoral responses. Anti-CD40.Env GP140 vaccine (CD40.HIVRI.Env) adjuvanted with Poly-ICLC&#xD;
      (Hiltonol®), in a prime/boost association with poxvirus vector vaccines, has shown to be safe&#xD;
      and elicit robust Env specific T and B cell responses in a non-human primate study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial we will also capitalize on data generated in a recent phase I/II trial showing&#xD;
      that co-administration of DNA-HIV-PT123 with an Env protein vaccine (as compared to other&#xD;
      vaccine regimens which do not co-administer the protein during the priming) results in the&#xD;
      rapid generation of high titers of binding anti V1/V2 Env region IgG Abs and Tier 1 nAb&#xD;
      responses (HVTN 096 study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We therefore hypothesize that co-administration of CD40.HIVRI.Env adjuvanted with Poly-ICLC&#xD;
      (Hiltonol®) with the DNA-HIV-PT123 vaccine will be safe and induce high titers of binding&#xD;
      anti V1/V2 Env region IgG Abs and other immunological parameters considered as immune&#xD;
      correlates in RV144 trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When all the 12 participants of &quot;Solo 0.3&quot; group have reached W26 (2 weeks after the last&#xD;
      vaccination), or when the first 6 participants of the subsequent dose groups have reachedW6&#xD;
      (2 weeks after the second injection), the Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT), composed of&#xD;
      sponsor's pharmacovigilance expert, coordinating investigator, co-coordinating investigator&#xD;
      and methodologist, will review all accumulated Adverse Event (AE) data so far, blinding&#xD;
      manner. All AE, in particular grade 3 and grade 4 AEs, as well as Serious Adverse Events&#xD;
      (SAEs) will be reviewed. The current version FDA grading scale will be used for grading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Go-criterion for opening enrolment into the next groups: If no grade 3 or 4 clinical&#xD;
      solicited local/systemic or unsolicited AE or grade 3 or 4 biological clinical significant,&#xD;
      is reported at W26, two weeks after the last injection in any of all the 12 participants of&#xD;
      &quot;Solo 0.3&quot; group or at W6, 2 weeks after the second vaccination in any of the first 6&#xD;
      participants of one of the other groups, the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)&#xD;
      assessment will not be requested for the go to the next group and the &quot; go-criterion &quot; is&#xD;
      met. The trial can be continued by opening to the inclusions of the following 2 groups. The&#xD;
      DSMB will be informed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Otherwise, the DSMB will review all accumulated AE data. Enrolment in next group will only&#xD;
      start after the DSMB gives the green light.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the following pausing rule (pausing of all injections) will apply during the&#xD;
      trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pausing rule for vaccine related safety events : If a serious adverse reaction (relatedness&#xD;
      as judged by the pharmacovigilance department or the investigator responsible of the SAE&#xD;
      notification) is reported during any stage of the study, all vaccinations will be halted,&#xD;
      inclusions in the trial will be suspended, competent authorities must be informed and an&#xD;
      ad-hoc DSMB meeting convened for recommendations on the trial continuation. Vaccinations may&#xD;
      resume only after authorization is given by competent authority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By the conservative method, if the causality assessment could not be provided by the&#xD;
      investigator, the AE will be considered as possibly related.&#xD;
