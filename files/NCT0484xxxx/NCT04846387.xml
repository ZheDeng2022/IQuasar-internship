  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The lower urinary tract (bladder, bladder neck, urethra and urethral sphincter) has two&#xD;
      functions: Storage (Continence) and voiding (micturition). Lower urinary tract dysfunction&#xD;
      (LUTD) includes symptoms in the storage phase (such as urinary frequency, urgency,&#xD;
      incontinence) or micturition phase (such as voiding dysfunction, hesitancy and urinary&#xD;
      retention), or both. Proper urinary tract function is controlled by a complex network of&#xD;
      peripheral and central nervous system. A delicate and complex switch exists between storage&#xD;
      of urine and elimination of urine and in humans, the control over this switch is located in&#xD;
      brain stem. Although significant research efforts have been utilized to understand&#xD;
      supraspinal neural control of LUTs in humans, our understanding of the brainstem in humans is&#xD;
      very limited, mainly due to the small size of nuclei.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The extensive involvement of the brainstem in LUTS control has urged us to look into a better&#xD;
      way to investigate and identify the brainstem nuclei involved throughout the entire bladder&#xD;
      cycle, especially in neurogenic patients. To our knowledge, there has been no published study&#xD;
      using high-resolution MRI (7 Tesla) to study the role of brainstem specifically in LUT.&#xD;
      Brainstem evaluation in regards to LUT function in a thorough and accurate manner using&#xD;
      high-resolution techniques is of high priority for benign urology and National Institute of&#xD;
      Health. The findings from this proposal will lay the foundation to study of brainstem control&#xD;
      in the bladder cycle in neurogenic patients with high-resolution neuroimaging, and will be&#xD;
      seminal research in the field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that Grey matter (blood-oxygen-level-dependent BOLD) signals&#xD;
      and functional connectivity (FC) evaluation of the brainstem regions involved in continence&#xD;
      and micturition are superior in 7T when compared to 3T in humans allowing assessment of the&#xD;
      variations between men and women. Brainstem Regions of Interest (ROIs) include Pontine&#xD;
      Storage Center (PSC) (&quot;L region of the pons) and PAG are expected to be activated during the&#xD;
      storage (continence) phase and Pontine Micturition Center (PMC) (&quot;M&quot; region of the pons) are&#xD;
      expected to be activated during the voiding (micturition) phase.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current proposal will be the first 7-Tesla study evaluating brain and specifically&#xD;
      brainstem control over LUT. The study will utilize a noninvasive functional MRI (fMRI)&#xD;
      protocol that allows for evaluation of brainstem activity during continence and micturition&#xD;
      in real-time, using high-resolution neuroimaging techniques (7T fMRI) in both men and women.&#xD;
      The study will recruit 20 healthy subjects (10 male and 10 female) for participation in this&#xD;
      study. The participants for this study will undergo a few tests including a uroflow, PVR and&#xD;
      a protocol training session during screening at visit 1, and a fMRI at visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During screening, subject will be asked to come to their appointment with a full bladder. For&#xD;
      the uroflow, they will urinate into a special funnel connected to a measuring instrument in a&#xD;
      private bathroom followed by measuring Post void residual volume through PVR scanner. This is&#xD;
      to ensure that they do not have any urological issue which can disqualify them from the&#xD;
      study. At this visit, we will also instruct them about the urine voiding-holding task, our&#xD;
      noninvasive fMRI paradigm which will involve having the participant drink 500-750 mL of water&#xD;
      approximately 20 minutes prior to the start of their scan, which the subjects will be&#xD;
      performing during the fMRI portion of the study at visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subsequent Grey matter (BOLD) signals and functional connectivity (FC) analysis will&#xD;
      allow investigators to further the current understanding of brainstem control of the LUT and&#xD;
      bladder cycle.&#xD;
