  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: physical inactivity is a main cause of childhood obesity. Physical activity on&#xD;
      prescription (PAP) is an evidence-based intervention for adults, but has not been evaluated&#xD;
      in children with obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: to evaluate the feasibility of a PAP intervention for children with obesity by assessing&#xD;
      both clinical patient outcomes and implementation outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: a single-arm clinical trial in which children with obesity participate in a 4-month&#xD;
      PAP intervention. Measurement points are baseline and 4 months, with long-term follow-ups at&#xD;
      8 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: children with obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: physical activity on prescription (PAP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient outcomes: physical activity level/pattern (including sedentary time), BMI,&#xD;
      health-related quality of life, self-efficacy for physical activity, motivation for physical&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation outcomes: coherence, cognitive participation, collective action, and reflexive&#xD;
      monitoring in relation to PAP (the four core constructs of the Normalization Process Theory);&#xD;
      appropriateness, acceptability and feasibility of PAP; barriers and facilitators for&#xD;
      implementing PAP; recruitment and attrition rates, and intervention fidelity and adherence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physical inactivity is a main cause of childhood obesity which tracks into adulthood obesity,&#xD;
      making it important to address early in life. Physical activity on prescription (PAP) is an&#xD;
      evidence-based intervention developed in Sweden that has shown good effect on physical&#xD;
      activity levels in adults, but has not been evaluated in children with obesity. This clinical&#xD;
      study is nested in a larger research project aiming to assess the prerequisites,&#xD;
      determinants, and feasibility of implementing PAP adapted to children with obesity in&#xD;
      paediatric health care. Children's and parents' experiences of participating in the PAP&#xD;
      intervention will also be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a first, pre-clinical trial, phase, healthcare providers and managers from 26 paediatric&#xD;
      clinics in Region Västra Götaland, Sweden, will participate in a web-based survey, and a&#xD;
      subset of this sample in a focus group study. Findings from these two data collections will&#xD;
      form the basis for further development and adaptation of PAP to the target group and context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the project's second phase, this adapted PAP intervention will be evaluated in a clinical&#xD;
      study in a sample of approximately 60 children with obesity, between 6 and 12 years of age,&#xD;
      and one of their parents/legal guardians. Clinical and implementation outcomes will be&#xD;
      assessed pre- and post-intervention, and at 8 and 12 months' follow-up. Clinical outcomes are&#xD;
      physical activity level/pattern, BMI, health-related quality of life, self-efficacy and&#xD;
      motivation for physical activity, and intervention satisfaction. Implementation outcomes are&#xD;
      the four core constructs of the Normalization Process Theory; coherence, cognitive&#xD;
      participation, collective action, and reflexive monitoring; appropriateness, acceptability&#xD;
      and feasibility of the PAP intervention; barriers and facilitators for implementing PAP;&#xD;
      recruitment and attrition rates, and intervention fidelity and adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical study is nested in a larger research project employing a hybrid&#xD;
      implementation-effectiveness design. Design and analysis of the included studies is guided by&#xD;
      the Normalization Process Theory.&#xD;
