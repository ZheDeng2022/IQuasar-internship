  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nicorandil (potassium channel activator) is claimed to be as effective as Nifedipine (calcium&#xD;
      channel blocker) for tocolysis in preterm labour&#xD;
&#xD;
      aim of the study: To assess the efficacy of Nicorandil compared with Nifedipine as a&#xD;
      tocolytic agent in delaying labour for 48 hours following their administration&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preterm labour refers to a delivery that occurs between 20 weeks and before completing 37&#xD;
      weeks of gestation. It may or may not be preceded by preterm labor Preterm labor (PTL) is one&#xD;
      of the leading causes of perinatal morbidity and mortality. It is one of the major public&#xD;
      health problems, especially with reference to mortality, disability and health care expenses&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of preterm labor based upon clinical criteria of regular painful uterine&#xD;
      contractions occurs between 20 weeks and before 37 weeks gestation accompanied by cervical&#xD;
      change (dilation and/or effacement). Vaginal bleeding and/or ruptured membranes in this&#xD;
      setting increase diagnostic certainty , using the following specific criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uterine contractions (≥4 every 20 minutes or ≥8 in 60 minutes) Plus one of the following:-&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cervical dilation equal or more than 3 cm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cervical length less than 20 mm on transvaginal ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cervical length between 20 to less than 30 mm on transvaginal ultrasound and positive&#xD;
           fetal fibronectin test . (This criterion will not be relied upon in this study because&#xD;
           it is costly and widely not available in most laboratories)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since uterine contractions are the most frequently recognized sign of preterm labor,&#xD;
      inhibition of uterine contractions with tocolytic agents to prolong pregnancy and reduce&#xD;
      neonatal complications has been and continues to be the focus of treatment of preterm labor&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, could be used as a first line tocolytic agent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Owing to this side effects of Nifedipine, another novel drug (Nicorandil) is studied and&#xD;
      according to literature Nicorandil is as effective as Nifedipine for tocolysis in preterm&#xD;
      labour&#xD;
&#xD;
      is an anti-angina medication that has the dual properties of a nitrate and ATP-sensitive K+&#xD;
      channel activator. Nicorandil has proved to be safe as anti angina treatement in pergnency&#xD;
