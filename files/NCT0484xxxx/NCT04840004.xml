  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer death in worldwide. It is projected&#xD;
      that the vast majority, approximately 80% -85% of all lung cancer diagnosis is Non-Small Cell&#xD;
      Lung Cancer (NSCLC). Although there are significant improvements in the treatment of Lung&#xD;
      Cancer in recent years, there is still an unmet medical need for a specific population which&#xD;
      have advanced NSCLC and mostly is refractory to existing treatments. NK-1 antagonists are&#xD;
      generally safe and well-tolerated drugs and approved for the treatment of chemotherapy&#xD;
      induced vomiting and nausea. However, the recent findings in preclinical studies and&#xD;
      preliminary results of some case reports have suggested that their potential in cancer&#xD;
      treatment may not be limited to only antiemetic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the role of NK-1 pathway in emesis, the neuropeptide substance P (SP) binds to&#xD;
      Neurokinin-1(NK-1) receptor and this binding regulates the carcinogenic cell proliferation,&#xD;
      exerts an antiapoptotic effect, stimulates cell migration that leads to invasion and&#xD;
      metastasis of tumor cells and lastly stimulates neoangiogenesis via endothelial cell&#xD;
      proliferation. In this regard, the antitumoral effects of NK-1 antagonists against different&#xD;
      types of cancer are a leading area of research interest and need for further investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are three NK-1 receptor antagonists approved by health authorities:&#xD;
      Aprepitant (Emend), its pro-drug, fosaprepitant (Ivemend) and rolapitant (Varubi). All of&#xD;
      these drugs are non-peptid NK antagonists and have lipophilic properties. Therefore, they are&#xD;
      not degraded by peptidase and can cross the blood-brain barrier (4). In addition to the&#xD;
      potential effects of NK-1 antagonists in tumor area, their penetration to central nervous&#xD;
      system may also prevent from or reduce the brain metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long term use of aprepitant as off-label is relatively common. In several case reports,&#xD;
      long term use of aprepitant, up to 18 months, was successfully demonstrated in the treatment&#xD;
      of refractory nausea and vomiting due to gastroparesis or other unexplained reasons.&#xD;
      Additionally, in a very recent publication, it was reported that for the nausea and vomiting&#xD;
      associated gastroparesis, long-term off label use of aprepitant was successfully received and&#xD;
      well tolerated by three children (5 to 19 month-old) in the course of allogenic hematopoietic&#xD;
      stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the light of findings in preclinical studies, the antitumor effects of NK-1 antagonists&#xD;
      are dose-dependent and the higher doses than approved antiemetic effective dose are need to&#xD;
      achieve the antitumor activity. For aprepitant which will be used in present study, it has&#xD;
      been recommended &gt;20 mg/kg/day and prolonged use for antitumor activity. In a case report,&#xD;
      prolonged use of standard aprepitant dose in a patient with metastatic breast cancer, had&#xD;
      resulted with a reduction in CA153 tumor marker levels. In another recently published case&#xD;
      report, a patient with lung cancer was treated with combination of aprepitant (1140 mg/day)&#xD;
      and radiotherapy for 45 days, it has been reported that the tumor massed had disappeared&#xD;
      without any side effect related to aprepitant treatment. It is fact that the evidence is not&#xD;
      clear yet and further investigation in clinical trial settings is still needed for the&#xD;
      evaluation of the efficacy and safety of high doses and long-term use of aprepitant,&#xD;
      especially when administered alone to determine its own effect.&#xD;
