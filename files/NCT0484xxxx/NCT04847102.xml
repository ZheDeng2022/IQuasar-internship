  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 28,000 subjects will be enrolled in this trial. Eligible subjects will be&#xD;
      stratified by age (&lt;60 years of age and ≥60 years of age, the proportion of elderly people&#xD;
      ≥60 years old is planned to be ≥25%) and randomly assigned into the study group and the&#xD;
      control group at a ratio of 1:1 (14,000 in each group) to be intramuscularly administered&#xD;
      with the investigational vaccine or placebo in a 2-dose regimen at an interval of 28 days.&#xD;
      The experimental vaccines will be cross-vaccinated after available data of the&#xD;
      investigational vaccine show that expected efficacy and good safety have been achieved (i.e.,&#xD;
      subjects in the study group will be vaccinated with placebo and those in the control group&#xD;
      will be vaccinated with the investigational vaccine in the same schedule as stated above ).&#xD;
      After the completion of the second dose for crossover vaccination, subjects will be followed&#xD;
      up for 12 months for safety observation. An immunogenicity subgroup (n≥3000) and a&#xD;
      reactogenicity subgroup (n≥6000) will also be included in this trial to evaluate the humoral&#xD;
      immunity induced by the investigational vaccine and the solicited adverse events observed&#xD;
      within 7 days post immunization. All enrolled subjects will be followed up for the evaluation&#xD;
      of protective efficacy as well, which will be primarily characterized by the incidence rate&#xD;
      (person-year) of COVID-19 cases collected from 14 days after complete series. Adverse events&#xD;
      will be collected over 0-28 days after each vaccination and serious adverse events will be&#xD;
      collected from Dose 1 through 12 months post complete series.&#xD;

    <description>The SARS-CoV-2 mRNA Vaccine is formulated by encapsulating the mRNA, which encodes the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike glycoprotein (S protein) of SARS-CoV-2 and is transcribed in-vitro by the corresponding DNA template, in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). This vaccine is presented as a white to off-white dispersion for injection.&#xD;
Active substances: mRNA encoding the RBD of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
The vaccine is supplied in single-dose pre-filled syringe with 0.5 mL dispersion for intramuscular injection. Each dose (0.5 mL) of the vaccine contains:&#xD;
15 μg of mRNA encoding the RBD of the spike glycoprotein (S protein) of SARS-CoV-2, 0.339 mg of total lipids (including lipid 9001, cholesterol, DSPC, DMG-PEG2000).</description>
