  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study will be to compare the clinical effectiveness of bonded versus&#xD;
      vacuum-formed retainers regarding their retention capacity; periodontal health; survival&#xD;
      rates; and patients' perception after 12 months of removal of fixed appliances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypotheses are that there is no difference between the retainers in relation to the&#xD;
      aspects evaluated.&#xD;

      This single-center randomized controlled trial will be performed at the Department of&#xD;
      Orthodontics, Bauru Dental School, University of São Paulo, Brazil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 50 patients completing orthodontic treatment will be recruited. The patients will&#xD;
      be prospectively and randomly allocated into two groups. The first group will consist of 25&#xD;
      patients with canine-to-canine V-bend bonded retainers; while the second group will be&#xD;
      composed of 25 patients with vacuum-formed retainers. In both groups, the same retainers will&#xD;
      be installed in the maxillary and mandibular arches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated at deboning (T0), after 3 months (T1), 6 months (T2), and 12&#xD;
      months (T3). In each appointment, digital models will be obtained and the other clinical&#xD;
      variables will be evaluated. The primary and secondary outcomes will be compared between&#xD;
      retainers in the time-points evaluated.&#xD;

    <description>Periodontal status will be evaluated regarding the amount of calculus accumulation using the Simplified Oral Hygiene Index from Greene and Vermillion, 1978. The extension of calculus will be estimated visually in all erupted teeth. Each teeth will receive a score ranging from 0 to 3. Minor scores will indicate absence of calculus while higher scores will indicate greater calculus accumulation on the tooth surfaces.</description>

    <description>Periodontal status will be evaluated regarding the patients' gingival health using the Gingival Index described by Loe, 1967. The gingival health will be estimated clinically with a periodontal probe in all erupted teeth. Each teeth will receive a score ranging from 0 to 3. Minor scores will indicate acceptable gingival health while higher scores will indicate greater inflammation and unacceptable gingival health.</description>

    <description>Patients' perception will be assessed using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) containing a questionnaire with 9 questions related to the use of the retainers. Each question will receive a score ranging from 0 to 10. Minor scores will indicate that the patient felt extremely uncomfortable during the retention period while higher scores will indicate that the patients felt highly comfortable.</description>

    <description>The V-bend retainer is bonded in the lingual surface of the anterior teeth. The retainer is constructed using 0.024&quot; stainless steel wires. Differently from the conventional bonded retainers, this retainer presents V-bends in the sagittal direction, parallel to the occlusal plane in each interproximal contact point of the incisors and canines.&#xD;
The retainers will be bonded after adequate etching with phosphoric acid and application of adhesive with a low viscosity resin.</description>
