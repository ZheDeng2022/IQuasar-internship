  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The demographic evolution of old age is a reality. After the age of 75, 2 out of 3 people&#xD;
      living in institutions have neurocognitive disorders. Behavioural disorders such as physical&#xD;
      aggression, agitation, hallucinations, sleep disorders, generate difficulties in the&#xD;
      management of these patients and lead to unscheduled emergency hospitalizations.&#xD;
      Non-pharmacological management of behavioral disorders is recommended as a first-line&#xD;
      treatment because of its low risk and potential improvement (Haute Autorité de Santé 2009).&#xD;
      However, this management is not simple and obvious to put in place, especially since not all&#xD;
      elderly people with Behavioural disorders are in adapted structures. The advanced practice&#xD;
      nurse specializing in geriatrics has a place in this care pathway. Because of her skills, she&#xD;
      could &quot;organize multi-professional care, set up analyses of practices within the nursing&#xD;
      homes, train caregivers appropriately, and limit hospitalizations due to behavioral problems&quot;&#xD;
      (SALIEGE L. 2020). Advanced practice nursing is in its infancy in France, and everything&#xD;
      remains to be done (International Council of Nurses- directive). The aim of the study is to&#xD;
      identify the number of emergency room visits by people aged 75 and over for behavioral&#xD;
      problems in nursing home during a 6 month-period.&#xD;
