  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to investigate the changes in physiological, biomechanical and cognitive&#xD;
      performance under a traumatic sport-event (i.e., rugby match).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Regular participation in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in contact sports&#xD;
      may be related to increases in cerebrovascular injury and head trauma. The diagnosis of head&#xD;
      injury is lacking in validated objective measures immediate post event. Diagnostic markers&#xD;
      may also be confounded by the exercise type and intensity. Therefore, it deserves further&#xD;
      examination on a variety of functional (biomechanical and motor control) performance and&#xD;
      blood-based biomarkers to determine how these indicators are affected by contact sport and&#xD;
      the incidence of head injury. The study aims to investigate the changes in physiological,&#xD;
      biomechanical and cognitive performance under a traumatic sport-event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The study will use a two-group randomized controlled trial (RCT) with double-blinded&#xD;
      approach, comprising a traumatic sport-event group and a control group. Thirty rugby-7s&#xD;
      players will be recruited and randomly assigned to one of the two groups, where the&#xD;
      intervention group will play three consecutive rugby matches. Data will be collected pre and&#xD;
      post rugby match performance. Particularly, demographic and anthropometric data will be&#xD;
      collected at baseline and pre-match. Venous blood, biomechanical data, and cognitive-motor&#xD;
      task data will be collected at baseline, pre-match, and after each of 3 consecutive matches.&#xD;
      Notational analysis will be performed after each match. Venous blood will be collected 24,&#xD;
      48, and 72 hours after the 3rd match.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: It is expected to see a reduction in whole-body movement, coordination, and&#xD;
      cognitive-motor tasks as the number of games continues through fatigue and/or traumatic&#xD;
      events. It is also expected that changes in blood-based biomarker concentrations to correlate&#xD;
      with changes in biomechanical and cognitive-motor tasks. The proposed study will yield&#xD;
      meaningful, ecologically valid research regarding the occurrence of concussive events, the&#xD;
      influence of these on the biological system of the performer, with direct impact on&#xD;
      clinicians, scientists, and sport governing bodies. The scope of this study will have&#xD;
      implications on health and wellbeing within sporting populations at all levels, genders, and&#xD;
      ages. Additionally, the findings will facilitate greater understanding about the human&#xD;
      responses to exercise induced trauma.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in blood indicator</measure>
    <time_frame>Data will be collected at pre-match, and after each of 3 consecutive matches, and 24-, 48-, and 72-hours post-match</time_frame>
    <description>The day before tournament play each participant will donate 10mL of blood into two separate 5 mL serum separation vacutainer tubes (SST)s (Becton Dickinson, Rutherford, NJ, USA) On the day of the tournament another 10 mL blood sample will be collected into two separate 5 mL SSTs before the first rugby match and then immediately after each successive rugby match. After the last rugby match, blood will be drawn immediately after as well as 24-, 48-, and 72-hours post-match into two separate 5 mL SSTs.&#xD;
All blood draws will be performed using the standard venepuncture method. After blood is collected in the SSTs it will be allowed to clot for one hour at room temperature. Following the incubation period, the SSTs will be centrifuged at 1250 g for 10 min at 4°C. Once centrifugation is complete the serum supernatant will be removed and placed into two tubes (Eppendorf®) and stored at -80°C until analysis.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in biomechanical performance: Tandem Gait</measure>
    <time_frame>Data will be collected at pre-match, and after each of 3 consecutive matches.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be instructed to stand with their feet together behind a starting line with shoes on. Participants will walk heel-to-toe, so that toes of one foot touch the heel of the next at each step to complete a 3m walk (eyes open) as quickly and accurately as possible, turning 180° and returning (total 6m). A 38mm wide (sports tape), 3 metre line will mark the walkway on the floor. If participants step off the line, have a separation between their heel and toe, or touch or grab the examiner or an object they will be corrected and asked to continue.</description>

    <measure>Change in biomechanical performance: Finger-to-nose</measure>
    <time_frame>Data will be collected at pre-match, and after each of 3 consecutive matches.</time_frame>
    <description>In line with a modified SCAT 5 protocol, finger to nose task will be performed within the data capture area with the participant standing with both feet on the force plate. Instructions will be delivered as follows: &quot;I am going to test your coordination now. Stand on both feet with eyes open and your dominant arm outstretched in front of you. On the start signal, perform five successive finger to nose repetitions using your index finger to touch the tip of the nose, and then return to the starting position. Perform the movements as quickly and as accurately as possible.&quot;</description>

    <measure>Change in cognitive-motor performance: Purdue Pegboard</measure>
    <time_frame>Data will be collected at pre-match, and after each of 3 consecutive matches.</time_frame>
    <description>Perdue pegboard was used to explore bimanual finger and hand dexterity (Tiffin, 1968; Tiffin &amp; Asher, 1948). The Purdue Pegboard consists of two parallel rows of 25 holes, in which pegs initially located in two laterally located cups, are inserted, followed by collars and washers are initially positioned in two middle cups. Four sub-tests are performed. In the first sub-test, as many pins as possible are placed in the holes (from top to bottom), first with the preferred hand, then in the second sub-test with the non-preferred hand, and in the third sub-test with both hands, within a 30-s time period. In the fourth subtest, the participant uses both hands alternately to construct &quot;assemblies,&quot; consisting of a peg, a washer, a collar, and another washer within 1 minute.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in cognitive-motor performance: Tapping Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Data will be collected at pre-match, and after each of 3 consecutive matches.</time_frame>
    <description>The finger-tapping test (FTT) examines motor speed and lateralized coordination. To run the test, the palm should will be taped to a flat board, with fingers extended. The index finger will then 'tap' on a computer key board button. Participants will be asked to tap each finger as quickly as possible on the button over a 10-s time period. Three trials with each finger will be run. Number of taps will be averaged across trials, in order to increase the number on the counting device with each tap. https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4419-1698-3_343</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in cognitive-motor performance: Working memory</measure>
    <time_frame>Data will be collected at pre-match, and after each of 3 consecutive matches.</time_frame>
    <description>Digit Span Backward test, participants are presented with a series of digits to be repeated backward. As detailed by Ramsay and Reynold (1995) the score of working memory is calculated from the temporal responses to the increasing number strings. The raw score will be used as a measure of working memory.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Demographics and anthropometrics</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline</time_frame>
    <description>At baseline, a series of demographic information and covariates related to sport concussion will be collected, including age, sex, duration of training, medication use, medical history (e.g., mental health problems), health behaviours (e.g., exercise prior to blood draw, alcohol consumption, smoking), history of rugby play, rugby position, and concussion history.&#xD;
In addition to standing height and total body mass, personalised anthropometric measures will be calculated for each rugby player using digitised coordinate data from whole-body static images, these measures will provide body segment inertia characteristics based on (Gittoes et al., 2009, and Yeadon, 1990).</description>
