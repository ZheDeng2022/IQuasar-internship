      In this study, researchers will test the effectiveness of probiotic consumption against oral&#xD;
      pathogenic bacteria and reduce the occurrence of gingival inflammation in subjects using&#xD;
      orthodontic fixed appliances (braces).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lactobacillus reuteri is one of the probiotic bacteria that has been identified for its&#xD;
      health benefits. L. reuteri produces antimicrobial substances, reuterin and reutericyclin&#xD;
      which are active against wide range of pathogenic organisms. Previously, investigator&#xD;
      performed a pilot study on the beneficial health effect of probiotic L. reuteri containing&#xD;
      lozenges on a few orthodontic patients and it was proven that taking this probiotic for two&#xD;
      weeks could significantly reduce the number of pathogenic bacteria in the patients' saliva.&#xD;
      In vitro study showed that L. reuteri has the ability to modulate the inflammatory response&#xD;
      such as TNF alpha and interleukins. However, The ability of L. reuteri in modulating the&#xD;
      inflammatory response viz. Interleukin 1-beta, Interleukin 6, interleukin 8, interleukin 10,&#xD;
      TNF alpha, MMP-9 and RANKL and effect on oral metagenomic microbiome profile in patients&#xD;
      undergoing orthodontic treatment has not been previously investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the effect of consumption of L. reuteri Prodentis probiotic lozenges on the&#xD;
           inflammatory response (inflammation) of gingival fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the effect of consumption of the probiotic lozenges of L. reuteri Prodentis&#xD;
           against oral pathogens in dental plaque and saliva.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was conducted to observe the effectiveness of L. reuteri (ProDentis) probiotic&#xD;
      against oral pathogenic bacteria on patients using orthodontic fixed appliance, to reduce gum&#xD;
      inflammation and improve oral health.&#xD;

      Rationale and background of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aesthetics is a primary consideration for patients seeking orthodontic treatment. However,&#xD;
      apart from esthetic aspects, the malalignment of teeth may also cause health concerns&#xD;
      affecting oral function such as mastication, speech, and psychosocial problems due to&#xD;
      impaired dentofacial aesthetics. Hence, the subjects undergoing fixed orthodontic treatment&#xD;
      may come across several oral health related issues. The fixed orthodontic treatment is known&#xD;
      to place the subject at risk of accumulation of heavy dental plaque which alters the&#xD;
      symbiotic ecosystem of oral microbiome. This leads to dysbiotic oral micrbiome which harbore&#xD;
      more pathogenic species. It has been shown pathogenic S. mutans, P. gingivalis, A.&#xD;
      actinomycetemcomitans and C. albicans are present in orthodontic patients who do not pay&#xD;
      enough attention to oral hygiene procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      S. mutans is a facultative anaerobic Gram-positive oral bacteria that has an important role&#xD;
      in developing dental caries. P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans are an anaerobic&#xD;
      Gram-negative oral bacteria associated with periodontitis. Data from The National Health and&#xD;
      Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) suggest 14% orthodontic patients in the US over 20&#xD;
      years of age have moderate to severe periodontitis. Moreover, presence and pathogenic&#xD;
      potential of C. albicans in periodontal pocket of these patients has been shown. C. albicans&#xD;
      is a robust biofilm-forming organism, presenting therapeutic complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      L. reuteri is a commensal oral probiotic bacterium, that is known to a produce antibacterial&#xD;
      compound, reuterin. The structure of this broad-spectrum antimicrobial is related to&#xD;
      hydroxypropionaldehyde, which formed during fermentation with glycerol. Previous studies have&#xD;
      shown beneficial effect of reuterin against pathogenic oral bacteria. Moreover, it is safe to&#xD;
      be used as chewing gums or yoghurts. Furthermore, previous study found that L.&#xD;
      reuteri-containing gum was effective in reducing plaque accumulation and gingivitis in&#xD;
      patient with moderate to severe gingivitis. Therefore, L. reuteri-containing chewing gum has&#xD;
      considerable evidence to be used for the improvement of oral health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data: As a pilot study, investigators collected saliva samples from eight&#xD;
      orthodontic patients (mean age 21 years) before and two weeks after daily probiotic&#xD;
      consumption. A duplicate sample was collected from each subject. The results showed&#xD;
      significant reductions in S. mutans serotype c, S. mutans serotype d, P. gingivalis, and A.&#xD;
      actinomycetemcomitans after probiotic consumption (p&lt;0.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research gap: The ability of L. reuteri in modulating the inflammatory response viz.&#xD;
      Interleukin 1 beta, Interleukin 6, interleukin 8, interleukin 10, TNF alpha, MMP-9 and RANKL&#xD;
      and effect on oral metagenomic microbiome profile in patients undergoing orthodontic&#xD;
      treatment has not been previously investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lactobacillus reuteri Prodentis lozenges, along the placebos for comparison, were shipped&#xD;
      from BioGaia, Stockholm, Sweden. Double-blinded numbering for the lozenges was done prior to&#xD;
      shipment for the researchers to prevent bias, thus the only party that has information&#xD;
      regarding the lozenges difference between the treatment and placebos is BioGaia. Neither the&#xD;
      test subjects nor the researchers has the knowledge regarding the lozenges difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BioGaia Prodentis lozenges is a food supplement for oral health containing the patented&#xD;
      lactic acid bacterium Limosilactobacillus reuteri (formerly known as Lactobacillus reuteri)&#xD;
      Prodentis (a strain combination of L. reuteri DSM 17938 and L. reuteriATCC PTA 5289) that&#xD;
      helps the good microorganisms keep a natural balance in the mouth. This product is safe for&#xD;
      daily use and the product can be used during pregnancy and breast-feeding. Ingredients of&#xD;
      this poduct : bulking agent (isomalt), L. reuteri DSM 17938 and L. reuteri ATCC PTA 5289,&#xD;
      fully hydrogenated palm oil, peppermint flavor, menthol flavor, peppermint oil and sweetener&#xD;
      (sucralose). One lozenge consists of a minimum of 200 million live L. reuteriProdentis. Net&#xD;
      weight per lozenge, 800 mg. Excessive consumption may have laxative effects due to the&#xD;
      content of sweeteners in the product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research subject:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate its clinical efficacy, the probiotic L. reuteri-containing lozenges will&#xD;
      be used for the patients undergoing fixed orthodontic therapy as previously described in the&#xD;
      pilot study. A randomized controlled trial using a parallel design with 21 subjects in the&#xD;
      test group and 21 subjects in the control group will be conducted. The sample size&#xD;
      calculation was performed by assuming the control group will have no change in the oral&#xD;
      pathogens whilst the test group will have a reduction observed in the pilot study.&#xD;
      Considering the 2-sided test with 0.05 level of significance and 80% power in detecting such&#xD;
      differences between the two groups, 21 subjects in each group would be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are student volunteers or patients of Faculty of Dentistry, Trisakti University,&#xD;
      undergoing orthodontic treatment with fixed appliance, with following inclusion criteria: age&#xD;
      of 18-28 of either gender; undergoing orthodontic treatment with fixed appliance for the last&#xD;
      one year; no consumption of probiotics (min. 3 months prior); no consumption of medicine such&#xD;
      antibiotic (min 3 months prior) and PBI Score &gt;1. The exclusion criteria are subject with&#xD;
      systemic diseases and allergic to probiotic. Subjects were recruited by an undergoing&#xD;
      graduate student that was part of the research team. Subject candidates that are reluctant or&#xD;
      unwilling may directly decline the recruitment invitation wholeheartedly, therefore the&#xD;
      volunteers that were recruited wholeheartedly agreed to become test subjects of this&#xD;
      research. The recruited subjects will then be randomly assigned to the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time for 3 samples collection was carried out approximately 15 minutes. Sampling will be&#xD;
      carried out at the executive clinic of the Faculty of Dentistry, Trisakti University Dental&#xD;
      Hospital. Participants will be given toothpaste and toothbrush during the study period and&#xD;
      subjects need to brush their teeth tiwce a day. Consumption of probiotics will be done 2&#xD;
      weeks after orthodontics control. Samples will be collected twice: on the first day (before&#xD;
      consuming lozenges) and the 14th day after the subject consumed lozenges containing the&#xD;
      probiotic L. reuteri. Probiotics are taken once a day for two weeks after breakfast and&#xD;
      brushing teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample collection methods Prior to sample collection, it was first confirmed that every&#xD;
      subject has undergone rapid antigen test for SARS-CoV2 detection due to the current Covid-19&#xD;
      pandemic (30th of September 2020), in which the result of the test must be a negative result&#xD;
      for every patient. Negative result indicate that the subject has no past infection of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV2. After confirmation, sample specimen from the subjects within the minimum of&#xD;
      two-week period after orthodontics control, was collected by a dentist / medical specialist&#xD;
      equipped with a complete set of personal protective equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva sample is collected using draining method. The subject is made to sit quietly while&#xD;
      bending down the head and opened mouth to allow the saliva to drip passively from the lower&#xD;
      lip. Saliva is collected using a sterile, pre-weighted tubes. Subjects should be in a fasting&#xD;
      state / two hours after breakfast. Subjects should not brush their teeth for a minimum of 45&#xD;
      minutes prior to saliva sampling collection. After saliva collection, it is recommended to&#xD;
      store the saliva samples at -20oC, should the analysis not be done immediately. Additionaly,&#xD;
      it is better to aliquot and freeze samples in several tubes to avoid freeze-thaw cycles that&#xD;
      could degradate the saliva quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plaque sample is collected by swabbing all (buccal/mesial/distal/lingual/occlusal) surfaces&#xD;
      of the individual permanent first molar using a sterile toothpick. Plaque sample was then&#xD;
      transferred to a sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After collection, plaque sample is&#xD;
      stored at -20oC until further analysis to be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) sample is collected using absorbent paper strip technique. An&#xD;
      absorbent paper strip is gently placed to a several selected site . Strip is removed after&#xD;
      light resistance is felt, approximately after being left for 30 seconds. Multiple paper&#xD;
      strips for one subject is pooled into several 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube containing 100 µl&#xD;
      PBS at 4oC. The tubes were subsequently stored at -20oC and used for further analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I : Clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of probiotic on gingival inflammatory&#xD;
      response of orthodontic patients using ELISA method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate its clinical efficacy, the probiotic, L. reuteri-containing lozenges&#xD;
      will be used for the patients undergoing fixed orthodontic therapy as previously described in&#xD;
      the pilot study. Subjects in the test group will be given two weeks of daily consumption of&#xD;
      the probiotic lozenges administered (2x108 CFU/tablet) after breakfast and tooth brushing.&#xD;
      Samples will be collected from all the subjects on day one and day fourteen. The gingival&#xD;
      crevicular fluid, saliva and dental plaque samples will be collected from the recruited&#xD;
      subjects prior to the group allocation using standard methodology as previously described&#xD;
      [30]. The collected samples will be stored in a cooler box and placed in laboratory&#xD;
      refrigerator at -80°C. The samples will be used to analyze the Interleukin 1-beta,&#xD;
      Interleukin 6, interleukin 8, interleukin 10, TNF alpha, MMP-9 and RANKL level using ELISA&#xD;
      method (BioLegend, San Diego, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II: Clinical trial to evaluate the probiotic effect on metagenomic oral microbiome on&#xD;
      orthodontic patients using NGS Saliva and plaque sample will be collected from each groups.&#xD;
      Investigators will do microbiome profiling for 40 samples each sequencing run. Bacterial and&#xD;
      fungal DNA of collected samples will be extracted using MoBio PowerSoil® DNA Isolation Kit or&#xD;
      Qiagen QIAamp® DNA Mini Kit. Extraction method will follow the kit's manufacture protocol.&#xD;
      Extracted DNA will be subjected to quality check using Nanodrop. Concentration of gDNA will&#xD;
      be measured by using Qubit fluorometer. The recommended gDNA concentration from each sample&#xD;
      is 5 ng/uL. Following quality control, V3-V4 regions of 16S and 18S rRNA gene of each sample&#xD;
      will be amplified using PCR. During library preparation, yielded amplicons will be converted&#xD;
      into library by using Nextera XT Index Kit (Illumina, US) accordingly to the manufacture's&#xD;
      instruction. All resultant libraries will be evaluated by using Qubit fluorometer and will be&#xD;
      sequenced using iSeq 100 platform (Illumina, US). Sequencing parameter will be 300 cycles&#xD;
      with PhiX control spike-in of 5%. Visualized microbial profiling data from the sequence run&#xD;
      can be viewed using Illumina Local Run Manager software.&#xD;
