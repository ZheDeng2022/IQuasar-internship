      Buzzy, shot-blocker, distraction cards, and balloon blowing can reduce fear and pain during&#xD;
      the intramuscular intervention in the pediatric emergency service unit. This study aimed to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of virtual reality, manual pressure vibration technique, and cold&#xD;
      vibration device application on procedure-related pain, fear, and anxiety during&#xD;
      intramuscular antibiotics in children aged 5-12 years in the pediatric emergency department.&#xD;

      Study Hypothesis The pain, fear, and anxiety scores of the children who watch videos with&#xD;
      virtual reality glasses during the intramuscular intervention are lower than the other&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pain, fear, and anxiety scores of children who were applied manual pressure vibration&#xD;
      technique during the intramuscular intervention are lower than the other groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pain, fear, and anxiety scores of the children who were applied cold vibration (Buzzy)&#xD;
      during the intramuscular intervention were lower than the other groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The emotional appearance scores of the children in groups before the procedure affect the&#xD;
      pain, fear, and anxiety they experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The group with children affects the vital signs before and after the distraction technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Study Design and Sample It was planned to include children between the ages of 5-12&#xD;
      who will be administered intramuscular antibiotics in the Dokuz Eylül University Pediatric&#xD;
      Emergency Service. It is planned to include patients selected by the stratified randomization&#xD;
      method in accordance with the sampling criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Children will allocate by the stratified randomization; gender, age, and&#xD;
      antibiotics type. Randomization was performed with a computerized random-number generator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Socio-Demographic Data Collection and Procedure Follow-up Form: It includes &quot;age, gender, the&#xD;
      reason for admitting to the emergency unit, the last painful intervention and date, the name&#xD;
      of the antibiotic administered, and the accompanying parent&quot;. At the same time, the duration&#xD;
      and vital signs of the interventions applied to the child will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wong-Baker FACES (WBS) Pain Rating Scale. This scale uses in children aged 3 and older to&#xD;
      rate pain severity, ranges from 0 (very happy/no pain) to 10 (hurts worst).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Child Fear Scale (CFS). The Child Fear Scale will use.This one-item scale measures&#xD;
      procedure-related fear in children, consists of five sex-neutral faces, ranges from 0 (no&#xD;
      fear) to extreme fear. This rating scale ranges from 0 to 4. It ranges from a no fear&#xD;
      (neutral) face (0) on the far left to a face showing extreme fear on the far right. Higher&#xD;
      scores mean a worse outcome. The rater response indicates the level of fear. It can be used&#xD;
      during the procedure for children aged 5-10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Children's Anxiety Meter (CAM-S). The Children's Anxiety Meter assesses children's&#xD;
      anxiety and uses before medical procedures. This scale is drawn like a thermometer with a&#xD;
      bulb at the bottom and also includes horizontal lines at intervals going up to the top&#xD;
      (0-10). This scale ranges from 0 to 10. Higher values represent higher anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emotional Appearance Scale for Children: This scale allows direct behavioral observation,&#xD;
      consists of 5 different behavioral categories; 'Facial Expression', 'Speaking', 'Activity',&#xD;
      'Interaction' and 'Cooperation Level'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scale scoring is done by reviewing the descriptions of behavior in each category and&#xD;
      selecting the numerical value that most represents the observed behavior. Each category is&#xD;
      scored from 1 to 5. The total score is made so that the numerical value is between 5-25 by&#xD;
      adding the points obtained for each category. Higher scale score indicates the appearance of&#xD;
      more negative emotional behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection process Each patient included in the study will be taken to the bed where the&#xD;
      intervention will be made and monitored, pulse, respiration, and blood pressure will be&#xD;
      measured. The child will be evaluated by the nurse before the procedure with the Emotional&#xD;
      Appearance Scale for Children (0. Min).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the virtual glasses group, the video will be started by wearing virtual glasses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The manual pressure vibration technique will be applied for 15 seconds. In the cold vibration&#xD;
      group, Arı Buzzy will be connected 5 cm above the IM intervention area and applied for 15&#xD;
      seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hour/minute applied by the IM intervention will be recorded. When he enters the vascular&#xD;
      access, he will give information to the child by saying &quot;now it will be over, I am pressing&#xD;
      it with cotton&quot;. The patient's pulse, respiration, blood pressure will be measured again&#xD;
      (minutes will be recorded). Pulse, respiration, and blood pressure will be re-evaluated at&#xD;
      the 5th minute of the beginning of the procedure. At the 5th minute of the procedure, the&#xD;
      child will be asked to evaluate the most painful moment he feels during the procedure with&#xD;
      the Facial Expressions Rating Scale. The child will be given the Child Fear Scale (CAS) and&#xD;
      the Child Anxiety Scale-Statefulness (CAS-D) to evaluate how anxious and afraid he or she is&#xD;
      during the procedure. You will be asked to mark it with a pencil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics Ethical approval was received from the Non-Invasive Clinical Studies Ethics Committee&#xD;
      of the University where the research was conducted (5856GOA 2021). The researcher informed&#xD;
      about the aim of the study and obtained written consent forms from children and parents.&#xD;
