  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study is a randomized pilot trial to test the feasibility of a psychoeducational&#xD;
      virtual reality experience to increase motivation for behavior change among children with&#xD;
      overweight or obesity.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will be conducting a randomized pilot trial to compare a virtual reality&#xD;
      (VR) experience to a video. Each provides child-friendly nutrition education as well as&#xD;
      education on consideration of future consequences (episodic future thinking). The video acts&#xD;
      as the control condition such that we might begin to understand whether the psychological&#xD;
      presence produced by virtual reality might increase motivation for behavior change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VR experience consists of a game in which participants play a racing game collecting&#xD;
      healthy or unhealthy foods on the road. Collection of healthy foods increases speed, and&#xD;
      collection of unhealthy foods decreases speed. Participants then play in the &quot;future&quot; where&#xD;
      the food choices they made in the past also affect how they can move in the future game. If&#xD;
      they collected mostly unhealthy foods in the past they move slower in the future, and if they&#xD;
      collected healthy foods in the past they move faster in the future. However, foods collected&#xD;
      in the future game can also change their speed, and participants are able to experience both&#xD;
      future conditions i.e. they play in the future condition depending on if they ate healthily&#xD;
      or not in the past, and then they play in the opposite future condition. A narrator in the&#xD;
      game provides information on making healthy choices and about considering future&#xD;
      consequences. The control video covers similar education on making healthy choices and&#xD;
      considering future consequences. Additionally, the control video condition also includes a&#xD;
      short computer-based game about healthy eating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will enroll 60 English-speaking children ages 6-12 with overweight or&#xD;
      obesity who are not in behavioral treatment to address weight and one of their parents.&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from the community using methods such as social media and&#xD;
      flyers and will complete a phone-screen to determine initial eligibility. Participants&#xD;
      determined to be eligible over the phone will come for an in-lab visit. In-lab, children will&#xD;
      provide verbal assent and parents provide written informed consent. Children and parents will&#xD;
      complete baseline measures, including having height and weight taken, demographic survey&#xD;
      questions, assessment of participants' eating and physical activity behaviors, and other&#xD;
      survey assessments selected to evaluate participants' behavioral beliefs, behavioral&#xD;
      intentions, affect, and motivation for behavior change. Post-video or -VR participants will&#xD;
      take the same survey assessments aimed at evaluating behavioral beliefs, intentions, affect&#xD;
      and motivation for behavior change. Additionally, all participants will take usability&#xD;
      assessments to determine the acceptability of the video or VR and participants randomized to&#xD;
      the VR will complete measures to evaluate how immersive the VR seemed. At 2-week follow-up&#xD;
      participants will again report their eating and physical activity behaviors and some&#xD;
      cognitive measures in order to see whether the VR may have impacted behavior and cognitions.&#xD;

    <measure>Acceptability as measured by the System Usability Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed immediately post intervention/control</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed with the System Usability Scale adapted to be parent proxy-report for the child. The instrument measures usability. It consists of a 10 item questionnaire with five response options for respondents; from strongly disagree to strongly agree. It was originally created by John Brooke in 1986 to evaluation a wide variety of products and services.</description>

    <measure>Acceptability as measured by the Usefulness, Satisfaction and Ease of Use Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed immediately post intervention/control</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed with the Satisfaction and Ease of Use measure adapted to be parent proxy-report for the child. The instrument (Lund, 2001) measures the subjective usability of a product or service. It is a 30-item survey that examines four dimensions of usability: usefulness, ease of use, ease of learning, and satisfaction.</description>

    <time_frame>Assessed immediately post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed by parent self-report with the Presence Questionnaire (Witmer 2005) immediately post intervention. The Presence Questionnaire assesses involvement, auditory fidelity, adaption/immersion, interface quality, consistency with expectations, and haptic/visual fidelity.</description>

    <measure>Acceptability as measured by child interview questions</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed immediately post intervention/control</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed with child interview questions created by the study team. Includes questions regarding what children liked and didn't like about the control and intervention conditions, how engaging they found the intervention/control, and if they found the intervention/control motivating. Questions are answered on a 5-point smiley face likert scale.</description>

    <measure>Change in Self-Efficacy for Healthy Eating and Physical Activity (SE-HEPA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately pre and post intervention/control</time_frame>
    <description>Child self-report survey measure. The SE-HEPA measure was developed by Steele, Bindler, Power, and Daratha (2008) and is based on Motl et al.'s (2000) unidimensional measure of self-efficacy for exercise. The SE-HEPA is based on Bandura's (1977) social cognitive theory and was designed to evaluate a children's or adolescents' confidence in their ability to engage in healthy eating and physical activity behaviors. Items are answered on 5 point likert scales from strongly disagree to strongly agree.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Readiness to Change Diet and Physical Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Items are assessed immediately pre intervention/control and immediately post or at minimum 2-weeks after intervention/control depending on the item (some are administered immediately post, and some at minimum 2-week follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>The Readiness to Change Diet and Physical Activity Scale items used in Rhee et al.'s 2015 article were modeled from previously used questions and designed to categorize respondents into the five stages of change: pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action and maintenance. Parents self-report on their intentions to help their children with healthy habits.</description>
