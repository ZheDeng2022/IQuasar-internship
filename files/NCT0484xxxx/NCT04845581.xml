      Compare two diagnostic methods: UGTM and CBCT/CAD/PDIP in determing the gingival phenotype in&#xD;
      group of 30 periodontally healthy patients. Both methods were useful to establishing the&#xD;
      gingival phenotype, however, ultrasonic method was more precisely for measurement of gingival&#xD;
      thickness. There was positive correlation between the mean values of SGT and WKT and this&#xD;
      indicates the need to measure these parameters in order to determine gingival phenotype.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gingival phenotype (GP) should be determine in each dento-gingival unit as a 3D volume of&#xD;
      gingiva with the following parameters: width of keratinized tissue (WKT) and gingival&#xD;
      thickness (GT). The phenotype determination is extremely important during many dental&#xD;
      procedures, such as in dental surgery, orthodontics, prosthetics or implantology because it&#xD;
      allows to dental treatment planning and reduce the risk of complications. Previous methods of&#xD;
      determining the gingival phenotype were based on the shape of the crowns of the upper&#xD;
      incisors and transparency of the free gingiva. These methods are non-invasive, but&#xD;
      innacurate. The gingival phenotype may be determined more precisely by using biometry of WKT&#xD;
      and GT. There are several possible methods to measure the thickness of the gingiva, such as&#xD;
      bone sounding, cone beam comuted tomography (CBCT) measurement or parallel profile&#xD;
      radiographs, CBCT/CAD (CBCT and computer-aided design) and ultrasound method. The ultrasonic&#xD;
      gingival tissue measurement (UGTM) method is non-invasive, removes the need for anesthesia,&#xD;
      which may increases the volume of tissues, but requires the experience of the researcher.&#xD;
      However, it is considered as effective and reproducible method of the measurement soft tissue&#xD;
      thickness. CBCT/CAD/PDIP (CBCT/CAD and prosthetic-driven implant planning) method also can be&#xD;
      used to establishing the gingival phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements of WKT are most often carried out using a periodontal probe calibrated every&#xD;
      1mm. In each case, a necessary condition for the proper examination of the patient and&#xD;
      determination of GP is healthy periodontium.&#xD;

    <description>The UGTM and CBCT/CAD/PDIP methods are useful to determining of gingival phenotype but more accurate and repeatability is UGTM. The presence of a positive correlation between SGT and WKT indicates the need to measured these parameters for the evaluation of GP. T. It is very important to determine the gingival phenotype for each dento-gingival unit especially before complicated dental treatment.</description>

    <intervention_name>Diagnostic tests: Determination of the gingival phenotype, measure gingival thickness and width of keratinized tissue</intervention_name>
    <description>Gingival thickness was measured using UGTM method and CBCT/ CAD with PDIP technology at upper incisors and canines in three points localized midbucally : Free gingival thickness (FGT), supracrestal ( SGT) and crestal (CGT). Width of keratinized tissue was measured using periodontal probe calibrated for 1 mm. The gingival phenotype was determined by both methods according to the following criteria: GT ≤ 0,7 mm - thin gingival phenotype, GT &amp;gt; 0,7 mm ≤ 1,0 mm - medium gingival phenotype, GT &amp;gt; 1,0 mm - thick gingival phenotype. Toincrease the repeatability of the results, two researchers tested the same values twice on 2days interval between sessions.</description>
