  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of children attending the Glasgow feeding clinic (GFC) which looks&#xD;
      after a range of children with severe feeding problems who commonly have low appetite and&#xD;
      extreme thinness. The investigators want to find out if these children are more likely to&#xD;
      carry genetic markers of thinness.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thinness occurs as a result of undereating, but it is not always clear why an individual&#xD;
      child has not eaten enough, or how to get them to eat more. There is a need to understand the&#xD;
      child characteristics that predispose to undereating and the how these operate, in order to&#xD;
      design more effective treatment and prevention programmes. The Glasgow feeding clinic (GFC)&#xD;
      looks after a range of children with severe feeding problems who commonly have low appetite&#xD;
      and extreme thinness. The investigators want to find out if these children are more likely to&#xD;
      carry genetic markers of thinness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will invite up to 60 families to complete a standardised online&#xD;
      questionnaire (ICFET) about their child's eating behaviour and collect a saliva sample from&#xD;
      their child, sent by post. The investigators will identify how many genetic markers for&#xD;
      thinness each carries and relate this to their ICFET appetite scores and existing growth&#xD;
      measurements as well as their feeding history.&#xD;

        This is a heterogeneous population, united by their difficulties in eating solid food. The&#xD;
        majority are, or have previously been, tube fed and around half have some learning&#xD;
        disability. Thinness is very common in this group, but we will include all children,&#xD;
        whatever their current growth pattern.&#xD;
