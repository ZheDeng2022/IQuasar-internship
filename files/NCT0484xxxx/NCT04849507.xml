  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Feeding is critical for pre-term infants and term infants with hypoxic ischemic brain injury,&#xD;
      in order to be discharged home with their families and avoid a gastrostomy tube (G-tube)&#xD;
      placement. The proposed study will employ a novel system that stimulates the vagus nerve&#xD;
      through the skin in front part of the ear, the BabyStrong feeding system, to delivered&#xD;
      transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) paired with oral feedings daily for&#xD;
      10 days. In an earlier study at Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), this type of&#xD;
      vagus nerve stimulation resulted in more than half of infants who were slated to receive&#xD;
      G-tubes, taking full oral feeds by mouth and avoiding a G-tube. In this study some babies&#xD;
      will receive the therapy for 10 days and others will get no stimulation. If no progress is&#xD;
      made in feeding volumes by day 10, the infants will be switched to the other treatment for 7&#xD;
      days. Parents, study personnel, and care providers will be blinded to taVNS assignment. The&#xD;
      electronic stimulation device is Federal Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared for&#xD;
      investigational use, and the BabyStrong has been designated a Breakthrough Medical Device by&#xD;
      the FDA. This study will be conducted in MUSC's Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.&#xD;

      In this Phase I study, we will conduct a small-scale safety and efficacy study of the&#xD;
      BabyStrong portable taVNS feeding system. We will test the BabyStrong feeding system using&#xD;
      active (n=10) and sham (n=10) taVNS in infants with twice daily (A or B treatment) for 10&#xD;
      days, with cross over to B/A treatment if there is no progress with feeds within 10 days of&#xD;
      taVNS treatment. Subsequent A /B treatment will be continued for another 7 days for any&#xD;
      treatment effect, prior to arranging for G-tube placement if infant continues to make no&#xD;
      progress. If the infant attains full oral feeds and gains weight, they may be discharged at&#xD;
      any time during the treatment protocol. The treatment assignment will be blinded to care&#xD;
      providers, study personnel and parents. We will compare daily oral feeding volumes over 10&#xD;
      days prior and the 10 days of treatment, and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      changes before and after 10 days of taVNS treatment, and after another 7days if the&#xD;
      cross-over design is employed. Safety measures will be bradycardia and discomfort, as in our&#xD;
      prior taVNS feeding pilot trial, &quot;taVNs paired with bottle feeding in infants failing oral&#xD;
      feeds&quot; National Clinical Trials #04643808.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for success of BabyStrong feeding system: No sustained increase in discomfort&#xD;
      scores; No bradycardia; Improvement in daily feeding volumes compared with pre-taVNS, and/or&#xD;
      attainment of full oral feeds in 50% of infants; improvement in white matter microstructure&#xD;
      by diffusion MRI before and after active treatment.&#xD;
