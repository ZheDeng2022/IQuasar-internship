    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators have aimed to investigate whether GDM is a risk factor for&#xD;
      hearing impairment in newborns. To the investigators knowledge, this study is the first&#xD;
      prospective, controlled study on this subject.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is an increasingly frequent condition in the world&#xD;
      causing significant morbidity and mortality. GDM is a metabolic disease that develops in&#xD;
      pregnancy, and may result in complications in the pregnant women, similar to other patients&#xD;
      with diabetes. The prevalence of GDM varies in relation with the population and the&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria. Diabetes affects 6-9% of pregnant women; 99% of the cases have GDM, and&#xD;
      diabetes is diagnosed before pregnancy in the remaining 1% [(pre-gestational diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus (pre-GDM)]. Hearing loss is one of the most common birth defect in newborns. The&#xD;
      incidence of congenital hearing impairment is 2-3 per 1000 births. Early diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment is very important for the development of auditory pathways and protection of&#xD;
      cognitive functions. Therefore, newborn hearing screening programs have been in use in a&#xD;
      number of countries. Transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) and auditory brainstem&#xD;
      response (ABR) have been identified as basic convenient and applicable tools for neonatal&#xD;
      screening of hearing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suboptimal glycemic control during pregnancy has adverse fetal effects. Congenital&#xD;
      malformations, preterm birth and neonatal respiratory distress in the newborn are more&#xD;
      common, at varying rates, pre-GDM and GDM. Compared to the normal population, the risk of&#xD;
      congenital malformations is 1.9-10 fold higher in presence of pre-GDM, and 1.1-1.3 fold&#xD;
      higher in presence of GDM. Despite our awareness on these important complications, the effect&#xD;
      of intrauterine hyperglycemia on hearing of the newborn has not yet been studied in detail.&#xD;
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) often causes hearing impairment, however little is known whether GDM&#xD;
      is an antenatal risk factor for cochlear damage and hearing loss.&#xD;

    <description>Our study was conducted in accordance with the National Hearing Screening Test Protocol. The newborns had transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) with &quot;click&quot; stimulus as a hearing screening test in the first three days after birth, using Otometrics Madsen Accuscreen S/N: 36484 (USA) device.</description>
