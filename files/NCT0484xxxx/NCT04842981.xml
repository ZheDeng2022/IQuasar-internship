  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With this study the investigators aim to assess if drug metabolism changes in patients with&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis when an interleukin (IL)-6 inhibitor is initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with rheumatoid arthritis have an increased level of inflammation in the body which&#xD;
      can lead to decreased expression and activity of drug metabolizing enzymes in the liver. This&#xD;
      will lead to a decreased metabolism and excretion of drugs. The inflammation is driven by a&#xD;
      number of proinflammatory cytokines e.g., IL-6. The investigators hypothesize that patients&#xD;
      with rheumatoid arthritis initiating treatment with an IL-6-receptor inhibitor (anti-IL-6R)&#xD;
      will obtain a normalization of the activated IL-6-pathway resulting in increased expression&#xD;
      and activity of drug metabolizing enzymes and hence increased metabolism. Ultimately, this&#xD;
      normalization of drug metabolism could lead to insufficient efficacy of a wide variety of&#xD;
      drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will perform a clinical pharmacokinetic trial. The study will include&#xD;
      patients with active rheumatoid arthritis and a need to initiate treatment with an IL-6&#xD;
      receptor antibody. Patients will ingest a 6-drug cocktail consisting of probes for specific&#xD;
      CYP enzymes. Plasma and urine will be drawn over 6 hours to determine concentrations of the&#xD;
      drugs and their metabolites. Patients will then initiate IL-6 receptor antibody treatment and&#xD;
      to assess both short- and long-term impact of altered inflammation, the same 6-drug cocktail&#xD;
      will be ingested, and concentrations measured, after three weeks and three months. To help&#xD;
      understand the mechanism and the putative involvement of inflammation, markers of&#xD;
      inflammation such as cytokines, transcription factors, etc. will also be assesses.&#xD;
