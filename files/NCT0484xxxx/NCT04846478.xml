  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is testing whether molecularly targeted oral medications called talazoparib and&#xD;
      tazemetostat can be safely combined for the treatment of prostate cancer, and whether the&#xD;
      combination is effective in shrinking or preventing the growth of metastatic prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Talazoparib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tazemetostat&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1a/1b clinical trial to assess safety, tolerability and preliminary clinical&#xD;
      activity of the combination of talazoparib with tazemetostat in metastatic&#xD;
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved talazoparib or tazemetostat for&#xD;
      metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) but they have been approved for other&#xD;
      uses. Talazoparib has been approved for use in breast cancer, and tazemetostat has been&#xD;
      approved for use in certain types of sarcoma and lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Talazoparib is an orally administered molecularly targeted chemotherapy drug called a &quot;PARP&#xD;
      inhibitor&quot;, which acts to block the ability of cancer cells to repair certain forms of damage&#xD;
      to their DNA - the accumulation of damaged DNA causes certain cancer cells to die. Other PARP&#xD;
      inhibitors are already approved for use in prostate cancer patients with specific gene&#xD;
      mutations detected in their blood or in their cancer, and talazoparib is currently being&#xD;
      studied for treatment of prostate cancer in other clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tazemetostat is an orally administered molecularly targeted chemotherapy drug called an &quot;EZH2&#xD;
      inhibitor&quot;, which acts to block the production of proteins encoded by DNA in the cancer cells&#xD;
      that are important in cancer growth and survival. Tazemetostat is also being studied for the&#xD;
      treatment of prostate cancer in other clinical trials. In the laboratory setting,&#xD;
      tazemetostat causes changes in protein levels in prostate cancer cells that make them&#xD;
      sensitive to dying in the presence of PARP inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design involves two parts. The first part is called the &quot;dose escalation&quot; to find a&#xD;
      safe dose for the combination of talazoparib and tazemetostat. The second part is called the&#xD;
      &quot;dose expansion&quot; where additional participants are treated at the safe dose identified in the&#xD;
      first part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive study treatment for as long as they do not have serious side&#xD;
      effects and their disease does not get worse. Participants will be followed after completion&#xD;
      of study treatment for up to 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 38 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Funding for this research is provided by a grant awarded by the non-profit Prostate Cancer&#xD;
      Foundation along with Pfizer, Inc. In addition, Pfizer is supporting the study by providing&#xD;
      the study drug talazoparib. Epizyme, Inc. is supporting the study by providing the study drug&#xD;
      tazemetostat.&#xD;

             generation sequencing (NGS) after trial registration but prior to cycle 1 day 1 of&#xD;
             therapy. Confirmation of adequacy of this biopsy material for NGS is NOT required for&#xD;
             initiation of therapy. If elective biopsies are not being performed at the treating&#xD;
             institution due to preparations or precautions related to COVID-19, this requirement&#xD;
             can be waived on discussion with the trial PI.&#xD;
&#xD;

          -  Ability to swallow oral medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy, intravenous experimental agent,&#xD;
             radiopharmaceutical therapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to planned cycle 1&#xD;
             day 1 of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have received oral anti-neoplastic intervention such as an oral&#xD;
             hormonal agent, PARP inhibitor, or oral experimental agent within 14 days prior to&#xD;
             planned cycle 1 day 1 of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have not recovered from clinically significant adverse events due to&#xD;
             prior anti-cancer therapy (i.e., have clinically significant residual toxicities &gt;&#xD;
             Grade 1) except for stable complications of prior procedures (such as urinary&#xD;
             incontinence or erectile dysfunction) or Grade 2 anorexia, alopecia, neuropathy, and&#xD;
             fatigue, for which resolution is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants previously treated with an inhibitor of EZH2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease should be excluded from&#xD;
             this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop&#xD;
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic&#xD;
             and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to talazoparib or tazemetostat.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Participants receiving the P-gp inhibitors amiodarone, carvedilol,&#xD;
                  clarithromycin, itraconazole, or verapamil are ineligible. Participants receiving&#xD;
                  other P-gp inhibitors are not excluded but should be monitored for potential&#xD;
                  increased adverse reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants receiving BCRP inhibitors are not excluded but should be monitored&#xD;
                  for potential increased adverse reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants receiving any medications or substances that are strong or moderate&#xD;
                  inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Precaution is warranted with concomitant use of agents with a narrow therapeutic&#xD;
                  index that are substrates of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly&#xD;
        consult a frequently updated medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent&#xD;
        procedures, the participant will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other&#xD;
        agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the participant is&#xD;
        considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,&#xD;
             ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina&#xD;
             pectoris, or cardiac arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance&#xD;
             with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and nursing women are excluded from this study because they do not develop&#xD;
             prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Arterial or venous thromboembolic event within the last 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent active malignancy. Patients with non-melanomatous skin cancer, superficial&#xD;
             bladder cancer, cancer not needing active therapy for at least 2 years, cancer for&#xD;
             which the treating investigator deems the subject to be in remission, or any prior&#xD;
             malignancy that was treated with curative intent (no evidence of disease for at least&#xD;
             3 years) are also permitted to enroll.&#xD;
