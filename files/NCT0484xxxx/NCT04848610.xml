      The number of new Coronavirus-2019 (Covid-19) cases is increasing day by day despite the&#xD;
      warnings &quot;Stay at home! Wear a mask! Keep social distance!&quot;. The aim of this descriptive&#xD;
      study is to determine the risk factors that affect the Covid-19 infection in Turkey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of the lands within the Republic of Turkey cover Anatolia, while a minor part&#xD;
      covers Thrace, the southeast extension of the Balkan Peninsula. The population of Turkey is&#xD;
      83,154,997. Based on the natural, human and financial characteristics, the country consists&#xD;
      of seven regions: Mediterranean, Eastern Anatolia, Aegean, Southeastern Anatolia, Central&#xD;
      Anatolia, Marmara, and Black Sea. The majority of the population lives in the Marmara Region.&#xD;
      The online link of the form created on Google forms was sent to the participants' phones&#xD;
      between 18.10.2020 and 18.11.2020 and participants' informed consent was obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 43-item questionnaire form which had two sections and was prepared by the researcher in&#xD;
      line with the literature was used in data collection. The first section questioned&#xD;
      participants' personal characteristics (first letters of participants' names and surnames,&#xD;
      date of birth, profession, employment status, risk of Covid-19 infection, family type, etc.),&#xD;
      while the second section questioned the practices of following 14 rules declared by the&#xD;
      Turkish Ministry of Health to prevent the Covid-19 pandemic (using a mask, observing the hand&#xD;
      hygiene and social distance, etc.) and whether participants were diagnosed with Covid-19.&#xD;
      Identity details that could help identify the participants were not questioned.&#xD;
