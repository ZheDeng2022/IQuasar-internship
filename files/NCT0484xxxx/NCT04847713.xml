  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research project will serve on the enhancement of early detection, diagnosis and&#xD;
      follow-up of patients with Fabry Disease, through new biomarkers identification. This could&#xD;
      have straight clinical impact on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Early diagnosis, follow-up, and prediction of treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Suggestion about the optimal time to start treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The data obtained will help to deepen our knowledge of the correlation among Lyso-Gb3,&#xD;
           genotype and phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Better understanding of the pathophysiology of FD. To sum up, the results of the study&#xD;
           will make a significant contribution to scientific knowledge providing new evidence with&#xD;
           an immediate clinical application in FD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As well as, the project will serve as the basis for a large-scale project implementation to&#xD;
      validate the results obtained&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of the study is to identify biomarkers for FD in order to improve early&#xD;
      detection and diagnosis, define pathological phenotypes and facilitate the monitoring of the&#xD;
      disease and its response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1 Primary objective o Identification of biomarkers for FD, mainly linked with phenotype&#xD;
      (classic vs late onset); clinical manifestations (renal, cardiac and cerebrovascular FD&#xD;
      associated complications) and treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 Secondary objective o Correlate proteomic and transcriptomic data with geno-phenotype and&#xD;
      especially with Lyso-Gb3 levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5 Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1 Study design This clinical study is an international, multicenter, prospective, open,&#xD;
      with control group protocol, collecting biological samples (blood plasma) in patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with FD (treated and non-treated patients) and healthy subjects. The same&#xD;
      procedures will be done both control and FD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be recruited during 15 months and all procedures will be placed over a&#xD;
      single visit. The study will include two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FD patients (treated and untreated)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy controls&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be carried out with 3'omics analytical platforms (metabolomics,&#xD;
      transcriptomics and proteomics) will be applied. Patients will be recruited through the&#xD;
      Association of Lysosomal Patients-MPS Spain and Portugal and clinicians from Expert Centers&#xD;
      in Spain and Portugal in this disorder. Children and adults of both sexes with a diagnosis of&#xD;
      FD are eligible (refer to Section 5.2.1 Inclusion criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be performed in accordance with guidelines approved by the Galician (Spain)&#xD;
      and Portuguese Ethics Committees. Expressed consent from patients or legal guardian/legal&#xD;
      representative members if available will be written indicating that they understand the&#xD;
      purpose and the procedures required for the study and are willing to participate in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The informed consent must be obtained before performance of any study-related activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information related to the following variables will be collected from each subject: age, sex,&#xD;
      age at diagnosis, clinical symptoms at diagnosis, time of evolution, concomitant medications&#xD;
      and start date, genetic study, lyso-Gb3 levels and α-GalA enzymatic activity. Blood samples&#xD;
      (EDTA anti-coagulated, PAXgene Blood RNA, and Serum tubes) from each centre will be sent to&#xD;
      our laboratory for proteomic and transcriptomic research assessment. If subjects are under&#xD;
      ERT for FD, preinfusion and postinfusion samples will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease diagnosis and phenotype will be classified as classic or later onset according&#xD;
      internationally established criteria [17,18]. Recruited patients can be included in the study&#xD;
      without receiving prior treatment or with some of the pharmacological alternatives authorized&#xD;
      for commercialization, either replacement enzyme therapy and/or pharmacological chaperones.&#xD;
      The same evaluations will also be carried out in healthy agesex matched controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2 Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will obtain biological samples (one sample of blood plasma per participant) from&#xD;
      patients with diagnosis of FD, treated and non-treated, recruited through the Association of&#xD;
      Lysosomal Patients-MPS Spain and Portugal and clinicians from Expert Centres in Spain and&#xD;
      Portugal in this disorder. An age and sex-matched group of healthy subjects will serve as&#xD;
      controls. Controls will be identified from volunteers and nonmedical staff at the Clinical&#xD;
      Hospital University of Santiago. Controls will be required to have a negative family history&#xD;
      for lysosomal storage disorders and no clinical signs of FD.&#xD;
