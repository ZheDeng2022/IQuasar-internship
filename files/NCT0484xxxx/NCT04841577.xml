    <description>pIMDs are a subset of AEs of special interest that include autoimmune diseases and other inflammatory and/or neurologic disorders of interest which may or may not have an autoimmune etiology. The investigator must exercise his/her medical/scientific judgment to determine whether other diseases have an autoimmune origin (i.e. pathophysiology involving systemic or organ-specific pathogenic autoantibodies) and should also be recorded as a pIMD.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 consecutive days in total) of&#xD;
