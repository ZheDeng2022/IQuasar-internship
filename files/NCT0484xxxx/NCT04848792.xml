  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise is the cornerstone of disease prevention and often an important component of&#xD;
      treatment. However, the efficacy of an exercise stimulus is reduced with aging. This study&#xD;
      will investigate whether adding a treatment with phytonutrients found in cruciferous&#xD;
      vegetables can improve the exercise response in older individuals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Redox balance plays a key role in the age-associated increased risk for diseases. One reason&#xD;
      for the lower resistance to oxidative stress with age is a gradual shift in the redox state&#xD;
      toward a more oxidized cellular environment resulting in disruption of cell signaling.&#xD;
      Nuclear erythroid factor 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is the master regulator of antioxidant&#xD;
      defenses. Nrf2 drives expression of a host of genes involved in cytoprotection and&#xD;
      antioxidant defenses. The Traustadottir lab was the first to demonstrate Nrf2 activation in&#xD;
      response to acute exercise in humans, and in agreement with animal data, found an age-related&#xD;
      impairment in exercise-induced Nrf2 signaling. This underscores an important problem related&#xD;
      to aging, namely that older individuals are less sensitive to an exercise stimulus compared&#xD;
      to younger cohorts. The focus of the proposed study is to try to solve this problem by&#xD;
      amplifying the signal and mitigating the &quot;exercise desensitization&quot; exhibited by older&#xD;
      individuals to restore redox balance. This study will test the hypothesis that combining&#xD;
      acute exercise with sulforaphane will improve Nrf2 activation and downstream signaling in&#xD;
      older adults compared to either alone. Sulforaphane is a phytonutrient found in high&#xD;
      concentrations in cruciferous vegetables and a potent Nrf2 activator. The hypothesis will be&#xD;
      tested using two different approaches; the first experiment will use an in vivo-ex vivo&#xD;
      approach, where peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected from older men and women&#xD;
      (≥60y, n=30) pre- and post-acute exercise (in vivo) will be cultured and stimulated with SFN&#xD;
      (ex vivo). This allows for a greater experimental control of the SFN stimulus. The second&#xD;
      experiment will test the clinical translation applying the sulforaphane stimulus in vivo&#xD;
      through an oral supplementation of sulforaphane in the form of whole broccoli sprout&#xD;
      material, prior to acute exercise, in the same individuals. This second experiment will be a&#xD;
      randomized placebo-controlled cross-over design. For all trials Nrf2 signaling will be&#xD;
      measured by Nrf2 activation through an ARE binding assay, nuclear to whole cell ratio of Nrf2&#xD;
      protein, and Nrf2-dependent gene expression (HO-1, GCLC, NQO1, GR). Potential sex differences&#xD;
      will be investigated. The insights gained from this study are whether combining simple&#xD;
      interventions in the category of healthy lifestyle and preventive medicine can improve the&#xD;
      adaptive response to exercise in older individuals. This could have an enormous impact by&#xD;
      improving the health and well-being of older Americans.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The design of this experiment will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design, where each subject will serve as their own control. Randomization of order of trials (supplement/placebo) will be performed by a person that is otherwise not part of study personnel, and study personnel and subjects will be blinded to the order. The person doing the randomizing will keep a record of the order using study ID, and researchers will be unblinded upon completion of data collection.</masking_description>

    <description>The oral sulforaphane supplement is a myrosinase-active whole broccoli sprout material (EnduraCell Bioactive, Cell-Logic, Queensland, AU) containing 14 mg SFN per capsule. Three capsules will be consumed 90 min prior to the start of the acute exercise trial. The dose of 3 capsules is equivalent to approximately 220 µmol of SFN, which is comparable to that of other studies using broccoli sprout extracts and the recommended single dose.</description>
