  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive deficit is common in patients who have undergone whole brain or partial brain&#xD;
      radiotherapy. To counteract intellectual deterioration, the conventional strategies includes&#xD;
      drug- based treatments such as donezepil and memantine, which have shown to only provide&#xD;
      marginal improvement and, cognitive training regimens, both of which are usually administered&#xD;
      at fixed dose/intensities often leading to sub-optimal responses. This study aims to address&#xD;
      this clinically relevant problem by harnessing the CURATE.AI platform to identify&#xD;
      N-of-1cognitive training profiles the can enhance learning trajectories through&#xD;
      individualised calibration and training regimens. CURATE.AI is a phenotypic personalised&#xD;
      medicine (PPM) platform that correlates a patient's phenotypic response (cognitive&#xD;
      performance) to a certain input (training intensity) based exclusively on the patient's data.&#xD;
      This PPM platform is independent of biological system or interventional agent and can be&#xD;
      applied to any disorder treatment where dosing/intensity could be better personalised.&#xD;
      CURATE.AI is expected to optimise/personalise cognitive training in post-brain radiotherapy&#xD;
      patients by dynamically modulating the intensity of a digital cognitive test battery that&#xD;
      measures executive processing, multitasking and perceptual learning tasks. In addition, this&#xD;
      clinical feasibility trial aims to assess this cognitive test battery as a potential&#xD;
      analogous or complementary diagnostic tool as compared to traditional cognitive evaluations&#xD;
      performed by a clinician.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brain radiotherapy causes downstream cognitive deficits. Drug-based cognitive decline&#xD;
      treatments show little improvement and side effects may reduce patient compliance. Regimens&#xD;
      are usually administered at a fixed dose that doesn't incorporate high patient variability,&#xD;
      leading to sub-optimal responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective cognitive training can improve cognitive performance. Artificial intelligence&#xD;
      platforms show great potential for training personalisation. The CURATE.AI platform can be&#xD;
      used to identify N-of-1 (single subject) training profiles that can be used to optimise&#xD;
      learning trajectories through individualised calibration and training regimens, potentially&#xD;
      leading to improved outcomes compared to standard static or adaptive training strategies.&#xD;
      CURATE.AI uses only a subject's own performance data to identify the intensity needed for&#xD;
      his/her best output. As the subject evolves during the course of intervention, the training&#xD;
      intensities are dynamically modulated to maintain performance within a given range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here the investigators propose to test the feasibility of CURATE.AI, with a digital cognitive&#xD;
      test battery as the interface, as an adaptive training platform for cognitive training&#xD;
      addressed to improve brain cancer radiotherapy patients' cognitive performance. The&#xD;
      acceptability, implementation and limited efficacy of the digital intervention (DI) will be&#xD;
      explored. In addition, the investigators propose to test the feasibility of the digital&#xD;
      cognitive test battery potential as a digital diagnostic (DD) tool as compared to traditional&#xD;
      cognitive evaluations performed by a clinician. User experience and usability will also be&#xD;
      explored.&#xD;

    <description>A cognitive evaluation and a Digital Diagnostic (DD) session performed anytime before radiotherapy will serve as the baseline. After the radiotherapy treatment, which can last between 1 to 6.5 weeks, patients will have a variable recovery time (0 to 4 weeks). Subsequently, patients will be subject to a cognitive evaluation and a DD session, right before starting the Digital Intervention (DI) training. This training will comprise ten weeks of DI (three 10-15 minute sessions per week). Patients will complete cognitive evaluations and DD sessions at the end of DI, and 16 and 32 weeks after the end of DI.</description>
