  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a mindfulness-based&#xD;
      intervention to prevent weight regain in weight-reduced adults.&#xD;

      Specific Aim 1: Determine the effect of MORE on weight loss maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MORE will result in less weight regain compared to CON after the 8-week intervention, and&#xD;
      benefits will be sustained after 6-month of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine the effect of MORE on reward-related behavioral processes (e.g., food cravings) and&#xD;
      ad libitum energy intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MORE group will demonstrate changes in eating behaviors and energy intake associated with&#xD;
      preventing weight regain compared to CON immediately after MORE and after 6-months of&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
