    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of E7386&#xD;
      following oral administration of E7386 enteric coated TR prototype tablet formulations (TR1,&#xD;
      TR2 and optional TR3) and to evaluate the relative bioavailability of E7386 TR tablets&#xD;
      compared to E7386 IR reference tablet.&#xD;
