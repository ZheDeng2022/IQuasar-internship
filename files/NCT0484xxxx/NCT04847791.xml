    <textblock>
      TRIAL LAC is a randomized double-blind non profit multicenter study with a nutritional&#xD;
      product: bovine lactoferrin - Mosiac 200 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the hypothesis to be confirmed is that bovine LF, administered daily orally in addition to&#xD;
      standard therapies for 1 month to hospitalized patients with Covid-19 infection, can be&#xD;
      useful to limit the severity, progression of the disease, shorten the time of swabs&#xD;
      negativization (i.e. time required to eliminate the virus) and to reduce the morbidity load&#xD;
      associated with it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient recruitment will involve 2 centers in Italy: Ospedale degli Infermi (Ponderano,&#xD;
      Biella) and AOU Maggiore della Carità (Novara).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects enrolled will be randomized to two Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A (experimental arm) - Standard Anti-Covid-19 Therapy + Oral Administration of Bovine&#xD;
      Lactoferrin (fixed dose 800 mg / day) for 30 days Group B (control arm) - Standard&#xD;
      anti-Covid-19 therapy + Placebo administration (identical capsule with the same amount as an&#xD;
      inert compound, starch of corn powder), according to the same pattern of use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should be specified that the study treatment and placebo will be administered in addition&#xD;
      to the standard care in place, and therefore in addition to all the pharmacological&#xD;
      treatments currently used in clinical hospital practice against Covid-19.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been shown with 'in vitro' studies that LF is able to prevent the entry of SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      into the of the host cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, the available evidence suggests that LF may be a therapeutic option that can be used&#xD;
      to counteract and reduce the severity of Covid 19 infection. The study hase been designed in&#xD;
      order to demonstrate efficacy of Lactoferrin in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who will be admitted by Participating Centers for Covid-19 Infection will be&#xD;
      screened for eligibility for study . If considered eligible, they will be offered&#xD;
      participation in the Study, and it will be proposed and informed consent will be explained.&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be registered in a centralized database at the IT systems of the&#xD;
      University of Piedmont Orientale (UPO)/Hospital-University Company &quot;Maggiore della Carità&quot; of&#xD;
      Novara. The pseudo-anonymized patient data will be recorded by the clinical centre in an 'ad&#xD;
      hoc' Clinical Report Form with web-based access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent, patients will then be randomised to LF or placebo group&#xD;
      allocation using previous randomization lists Prepared. Randomization will take place on a&#xD;
      competitive and balanced basis per clinical center participant. Permuted block randomization&#xD;
      of size 4 will be implemented with an allocation ratio of 1:1 to ensure the balance between&#xD;
      the groups of treatment. The randomization list will be managed through a REDCap&#xD;
      randomization module.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Hospital Pharmacy of the Participating Center, not involved in the enlistment of&#xD;
      patients, will prepare a numbered sequence of sealed envelopes containing the code of&#xD;
      allocation, and will keep its list that will remain inaccessible to the professionals&#xD;
      involved in recruitment.These sealed envelopes will be opened sequentially, at the time of&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maintenance of the blind person will be guaranteed by keeping the staff randomization&#xD;
      lists, i.e. the staff of the Hospital Pharmacy, on the one hand (staff who will also manage&#xD;
      and deliver to the investigators the products being studied, which will look the same), and&#xD;
      the randomizing and experimenting medical staff, on the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The logistical location of the two staff will also be completely separated, in sectors of the&#xD;
      Hospital different and distant from each other, and not communicating in any way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should be pointed out that the patient enrolled by the clinical centers on the basis of&#xD;
      the selection criteria can start standard-of-care therapy, in any case, before the&#xD;
      randomization procedure being the identical basic therapeutic regimen in the two study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the calculation of the sample size required to demonstrate the primary endpoint, it was&#xD;
      used a model built on historical data regarding the same endpoint. Pre-trial data from the&#xD;
      two Participating Centres estimate the need for ICU admission at 25%; the need for mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation in 30%; hospital mortality in 15%; the average duration hospitalization in 16&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was determined considering a two-sided t-test for two independent samples&#xD;
      according to the following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A correct alpha level of 0.025 for two Bonferroni-method endpoints (Alpha&#xD;
           total=0.025x2=0.05)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A total power of 0.8&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A Cohen h effect size of 0.44 (corresponding to an effect standardized medium/small&#xD;
           [Cohen 1977]), i.e. with a 14-day resignation rate of 60% for controls and 80% for&#xD;
           treaties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this scenario, the size of the study achieved consists of 97 patients per arm of study.&#xD;
      Calculations were performed using the R 3.6.1 software [Core Team 2015] and the pwr package&#xD;
      [Champely 2018]. references:&#xD;
