  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand best strategies for engaging high risk populations&#xD;
      in a primary care setting to improved adherence to colorectal cancer screening guidelines.&#xD;
      The results will be used to identify best practices that are scalable to other high-risk&#xD;
      populations who are due or overdue for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening.&#xD;

      This is a prospective implementation science study that will test 4 different approaches to&#xD;
      increase colorectal cancer screening in a local primary care setting that provides services&#xD;
      to individuals who are under-resourced. The interventions will include reminders from primary&#xD;
      care providers with and without additional information and/or services to help complete&#xD;
      colorectal cancer screening. A review of electronic medical records will be used to identify&#xD;
      baseline information assessing risk factors and personal and family CRC history. For arm 3 of&#xD;
      the study, participants may elect to enroll in our existing health navigation program. If so,&#xD;
      additional baseline information will be collected, including information on Social&#xD;
      Determinants of Health (SDOH). For arm 4 of the study, a questionnaire will be used to assess&#xD;
      knowledge about colorectal cancer screening. The questionnaire will be repeated after the&#xD;
      intervention (informational video). For all arms of the study, the primary outcome&#xD;
      (engagement on CRC screening, receipt of CRC screening, results of CRC screening) will be&#xD;
      collected through EPIC.&#xD;
