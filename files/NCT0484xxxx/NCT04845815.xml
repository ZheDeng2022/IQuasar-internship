  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renal tubules play an important role in fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base homeostasis. Defect&#xD;
      of these functions can give rise to a host of disorders. These disorders can lead to life&#xD;
      threatening disturbances in electrolytes and acid-base balance. In Egypt, there is little&#xD;
      data about these disorders. Many of these cases are diagnosed late, therefore Early suspicion&#xD;
      for diagnosis can improve the overall clinical outcome of these children.&#xD;

      Renal tubules play an important role in fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base homeostasis. Defect&#xD;
      of these functions can give rise to a host of disorders. These disorders can lead to life&#xD;
      threatening disturbances in electrolytes and acid-base balance. In Egypt, there is little&#xD;
      data about these disorders. Many of these cases are diagnosed late, therefore Early suspicion&#xD;
      for diagnosis can improve the overall clinical outcome of these children. As a result,&#xD;
      starting management early will help those children have a better life. Therefore awareness&#xD;
      about these disorders and long-term outcome is really important. The investigators present&#xD;
      the clinical characterizations of many tubular disorder and the follow up in our center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to reveal the different clinical presentations and the main lab&#xD;
      features of renal tubular disorders in children to promote early recognition and management.&#xD;
