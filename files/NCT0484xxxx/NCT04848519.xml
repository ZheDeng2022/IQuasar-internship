    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effect of propranolol hydrochloride and pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      treating patients with urothelial cancer that has come back (recurrent) or has spread to&#xD;
      other places in the body (metastatic). Propranolol hydrochloride is used for the treatment of&#xD;
      chronic angina, cardiac arrhythmias, essential tremor, hypertension, and as prophylaxis for&#xD;
      migraine headaches, and may have anticancer properties. Immunotherapy with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and&#xD;
      may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving propranolol&#xD;
      hydrochloride and pembrolizumab may enhance the anticancer activity of pembrolizumab.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of the combination of propranolol hydrochloride and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab by assessing the overall response rate (ORR) as measured by Response Evaluation&#xD;
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the efficacy of the combination as measured by progression free survival (PFS;&#xD;
      from treatment initiation until disease progression, death due to disease, or lost to follow&#xD;
      up) and overall survival (OS; from treatment initiation until death due to any cause or loss&#xD;
      to follow up), and safety as measured by incidence of adverse events assessed up to 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY/EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess tissue-based assays in archival tissue and correlative changes in peripheral&#xD;
      T-cell subsets, myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC), blood inflammatory markers and&#xD;
      cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive propranolol hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21 and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days for&#xD;
      propranolol hydrochloride and every 3 or 6 weeks for pembrolizumab for up to 2 years in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then every 12 weeks&#xD;
      for up to 2 years.&#xD;
