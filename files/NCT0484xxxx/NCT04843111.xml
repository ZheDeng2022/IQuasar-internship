      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess maternal, obstetrical, pregnancy, and neonatal and infant outcomes among women&#xD;
      vaccinated with MenQuadfi® during pregnancy or in the 30 days preceding their Last Menstrual&#xD;
      Period (LMP).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective pregnancy registry to collect and analyze the outcome of exposure&#xD;
      to MenQuadfi™ during pregnancy or within 30 days prior to their LMP. The registry will&#xD;
      encourage prospective registration, which is defined as registration of a pregnancy exposure&#xD;
      prior to knowledge or perceived knowledge of the pregnancy outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposed pregnant women will be followed up to the end of their pregnancy, and the&#xD;
      offspring(s) will be followed up to 1 year of age.&#xD;
