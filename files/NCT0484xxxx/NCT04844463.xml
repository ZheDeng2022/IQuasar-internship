    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of JNJ-68179280 compared&#xD;
      with placebo after administration of single ascending oral doses of JNJ-68179280 administered&#xD;
      to healthy participants (Part 1), multiple ascending oral doses of JNJ-68179280, administered&#xD;
      to healthy participants once daily (Cohorts 1 through 4) or twice daily (Cohort 5) over 14&#xD;
      consecutive days (Part 2) and multiple ascending oral doses of an alternative JNJ-68179280&#xD;
      formulation, administered to healthy participants once daily over 14 consecutive days (Part 3&#xD;
      if conducted).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, vital signs, and 12&#xD;
             lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at screening. Any abnormalities must be&#xD;
             considered not clinically significant and this determination must be recorded in the&#xD;
             participant's source documents and initialed by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at screening. If the&#xD;
             results of the serum chemistry panel (excluding liver enzymes) including hematology,&#xD;
             blood coagulation, or urinalysis are outside the normal reference ranges, the&#xD;
             participant may be included only if the investigator judges the abnormalities or&#xD;
             deviations from normal to be not clinically significant or to be appropriate and&#xD;
             reasonable for the population under study. This determination must be recorded in the&#xD;
             participant's source documents and initialed by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have the following pre study intervention clinical laboratory values during screening&#xD;

             or equal to (&lt;=) upper limit of normal (ULN), b. alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;=&#xD;
             ULN, c. bilirubin &lt;= ULN, d. alkaline phosphatase &lt;= ULN, e. gamma-glutamyl&#xD;

             normal (LLN)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A woman must have a negative highly sensitive serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin&#xD;
             (beta-hCG) at screening and a negative urine pregnancy test at check-in to the unit on&#xD;
             Day -2 or Day -1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be a non-smoker (not smoked for at least 6 months prior to screening) and has not&#xD;
             used nicotine-containing products (example: nicotine patch, vaping, hookah) for 3&#xD;
             months prior to screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of liver or renal insufficiency significant cardiac, vascular, pulmonary,&#xD;
             gastrointestinal, endocrine, neurologic, hematologic, rheumatologic, psychiatric, or&#xD;
             metabolic disturbances&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of malignancy before screening (exceptions are squamous or basal cell&#xD;
             carcinomas of the skin and carcinoma in situ of the cervix as long as they are&#xD;
             considered cured with minimal risk of recurrence)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has an active, acute or chronic infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has taken any disallowed therapies, concomitant therapy before the planned first dose&#xD;
             of study intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a positive urine drug screen and/or alcohol breath test during screening or on Day&#xD;
