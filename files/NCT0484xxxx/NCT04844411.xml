    <measure>Number of Participants with Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>CADSS is an instrument for the measurement of present-state dissociative symptoms and will be administered to assess treatment-emergent dissociative symptoms. CADSS consists of 23 subjective items, divided into 3 components: depersonalization (items 3 to 7, 20, and 23), derealization (items 1, 2, 8 to 13, 16 to 19, and 21) and amnesia (items 14, 15, and 22). The participants responses are coded on a 5-point scale (from 0 equals to [=] not at all to 4=extremely). The total score is sum of the 23 items and range from 0 to 92 - best is 0 and worst is 92.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants with Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale (MOAA/S) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The MOAA/S will be used to measure treatment-emergent sedation, with correlation to levels of sedation defined by the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) continuum. The MOAA/S scores range from 0=no response to painful stimulus (corresponds to ASA continuum for general anesthesia) to 5=readily responds to name spoken in normal tone (awake; corresponds to ASA continuum for minimal sedation).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy on the basis of physical and neurological examination, medical history, vital&#xD;
             signs and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at screening. Minor abnormalities&#xD;
             in ECG, which are not considered to be of clinical significance by the investigator,&#xD;
             are acceptable. The presence of complete Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB),&#xD;
             atrioventricular (AV) block (second degree or higher), or a permanent pacemaker or&#xD;
             implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) will lead to exclusion. Heart rate must&#xD;
             be less than or equal to (&lt;=) 90 beats per minute (bpm)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at screening. If the&#xD;
             results of the serum chemistry panel, including liver enzymes, blood coagulation,&#xD;
             hematology, thyroid function or urinalysis are outside the normal reference ranges,&#xD;
             the participant may be included only if the investigator judges the abnormalities or&#xD;
             deviations from normal to be not clinically significant or to be appropriate and&#xD;
             reasonable for the population under study. This determination must be recorded in the&#xD;
             participant's source documents and initialed by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index (BMI) within the range 18.0 and 29.9 kilograms per meter square&#xD;
             (kg/m^2) (inclusive)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A male participant must wear a condom when engaging in any activity that allows for&#xD;
             passage of ejaculate to another person. Male participants should also be advised of&#xD;
             the benefit for a female partner to use a highly effective method of contraception as&#xD;
             condom may break or leak&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must sign an informed consent form (ICF) indicating that he understands the purpose&#xD;
             of, and procedures required for, the study and is willing to participate in the study.&#xD;
             Participation in the pharmacogenomic part of the study is mandatory&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to adhere to the lifestyle restrictions specified in this protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of or current significant medical illness including (but not limited to)&#xD;
             cardiac arrhythmias or other cardiac disease, hypertension, hematological disease,&#xD;
             lipid abnormalities, bronchospastic respiratory disease, diabetes mellitus, renal or&#xD;
             hepatic insufficiency, thyroid disease, parkinson's disease, psychiatric disorders,&#xD;
             infection, or any other illness that the investigator considers should exclude the&#xD;
             participant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of malignancy within 5 years before screening (exceptions are squamous and&#xD;
             basal cell carcinomas of the skin, or malignancy that in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, with written concurrence with the safety responsible physician, is&#xD;
             considered cured with minimal risk of recurrence)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systolic blood pressure greater than (&gt;)140 millimeters of mercury (mmHg), diastolic&#xD;
             blood pressure &gt;90 mmHg or respiratory rate &gt; 18 at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has had coronavirus disease (COVID) as confirmed by a positive severe acute&#xD;
             respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-COV-2) test (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]&#xD;
             or rapid antigen test, not an antibody test) within the past 3 months and/or has&#xD;
             required hospitalization for treatment of COVID at any timepoint and/or has reported&#xD;
             sequelae from COVID at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received an investigational intervention (including investigational vaccines) or used&#xD;
             an invasive investigational medical device within 90 days (or 5 half-lives whichever&#xD;
             is longest) before the planned first dose of study intervention or is currently&#xD;
             enrolled in an investigational study&#xD;
