      Interventional retrospective prospective randomized clinical trial (RCT) in parallel groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size is 384 patients with loss of teeth and vitamin D imbalance. All patients will&#xD;
      undergo or underwent dental implantation after additional investigations which reveal vitamin&#xD;
      D imbalance (&lt;30 ng/ml or &lt;75 nmol/l).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 1 group will include 192 patients who will be or were operated on with dental implants&#xD;
      after stabilization of vitamin D level with a help of an endocrinologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 2 group will include 192 patients who will be or were operated on during the treatment of&#xD;
      vitamin D imbalance prescribed by the endocrinologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The possible difference between groups can be considered the change of dental implants&#xD;
      survival time and bone resorption level depending on the level of vitamin D and treatment&#xD;
      time by the endocrinologist.&#xD;

      A purpose is to increase the efficiency of rehabilitation of patients with loss of teeth and&#xD;
      mineral metabolism disorders due to vitamin D3 imbalance using an interdisciplinary approach&#xD;
      to dental implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective prospective RCT in parallel groups includes 384 patients with loss of teeth and&#xD;
      vitamin D3 imbalance who will undergo or underwent the dental implantation on the base of&#xD;
      Oral Surgery Department of Borovskiy Institute of Dentistry of I.M.Sechenov First Moscow&#xD;
      State Medical University (Sechenov University) and private dental clinic 'Society with&#xD;
      limited responsibility (SLR) Topaz 2000' from 2010 till the 2021 year: prospective part will&#xD;
      include 100 patients, the retrospective part will include 284 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The counted sample size according to loss of teeth prevalence in Russia on the base of&#xD;
      Sechenov University and private dental clinic Topaz 2000 is equal to 384 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be assured by surgeons blinded to endocrinologic status of patients who&#xD;
      underwent or will undergo the dental implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be included in 2 groups: 1 group will include patients (n=192),&#xD;
      25-50-years-old, with loss of teeth and mineral metabolism disorders due to vitamin D3&#xD;
      imbalance (&lt;30 ng/ml, or &lt;75 nmol/l) who will undergo dental implant placement after&#xD;
      stabilization of vitamin D3 levels (&gt;30-60 ng/ml, or 75-150 nmol/l for the process of&#xD;
      treatment and monitoring); 2 group will include patients, 25-50-years-old, with the loss of&#xD;
      teeth and mineral metabolism disorders due to vitamin D3 imbalance (n=192) who will undergo&#xD;
      the dental implantation during treatment by an endocrinologist before the stabilization of&#xD;
      vitamin D3 level in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be directed for lab tests to detect mineral imbalance (vitamin D, ng/ml;&#xD;
      parathyroid hormone (PH), thyroperoxidase antibodies (anti-TPO), Thyrotoxin 3 free (TT),&#xD;
      Thyrotropic hormone (TH) pg/l) before dental implantation, and according to results, we will&#xD;
      discuss further plan treatment with the endocrinologist. If it is needed due to the&#xD;
      indications (adults with osteoporotic fractures; adults with a disease or condition&#xD;
      accompanied by reduced bone mass or bone loss; all persons in the appointment of drug&#xD;
      therapy, iatrogenic in relation to loss of bone mass; all patients receiving anti-osteopathic&#xD;
      treatment to monitor its effectiveness; all persons who are not yet receiving treatment, but&#xD;
      who may need it in case of bone loss.), Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) of skeleton&#xD;
      mineral bone density will be done. After appropriate systemic treatment with vitamin D3 in 2&#xD;
