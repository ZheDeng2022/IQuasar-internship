  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to describe the movement of the diaphragm during postural activation&#xD;
      of the trunk muscles in comparison with tidal breathing.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diaphragm movement will be measured by m-mode ultrasonography in a standing position. 30-35&#xD;
      healthy subjects will participate in the study. The movement of the diaphragm will be&#xD;
      measured during tidal breathing then, during holding a load corresponding to 20% of the&#xD;
      subject´s body weight and finally, during voluntary contraction of the trunk muscles. Trunk&#xD;
      muscles contraction will be measured by a special device with pressure sensors placed on a&#xD;
      trunk surface. Breathing activity will be measured by spirometry.&#xD;
