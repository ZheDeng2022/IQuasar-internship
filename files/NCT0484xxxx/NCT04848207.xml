  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The importance of this trial lies in testing if intraoral digital impressions will increase&#xD;
      the accuracy of impressions of full arch implant cases over conventional impression&#xD;
      techniques thus improving the passivity of full arch screw retained prosthesis and decreasing&#xD;
      the prosthetic complications in turn.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study intraoral digital impressions will be used for scanning full arch implant cases&#xD;
      to minimize the variables in the conventional technique, finally the study will investigate&#xD;
      if the intraoral digital impressions will increase the accuracy of impressions of full arch&#xD;
      implant cases thus improving the passivity and decreasing prosthetic complications of screw&#xD;
      retained prosthesis for a long-term success compared to open tray impression technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome will be evaluation of the passivity of PMMA (Polymethyl methacrylate ) try-in&#xD;
      , while secondary outcomes will be detecting prosthetic complications (screw loosening ,&#xD;
      prosthesis fracture) and treatment time for both groups.&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Uncontrolled diabetic patients( Diabetes, hypertension)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Completely edentulous patients that have received dental implants and ready to start&#xD;
      prosthetic steps of full arch screw retained prosthesis will be recruited and randomly&#xD;
      divided into two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 ( control group):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary impression will be taken followed by customization of open special trays for&#xD;
           each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transfer copings will be screwed to the multiunit abutments on the existing implants,&#xD;
           and splinted together using pre-cured printed resin splinting framework that will be&#xD;
           fixed to the copings using flowable composite and one step impression technique using&#xD;
           putty and light addition silicon will be made . Implant analogs will be attached to the&#xD;
           transfer copings and pouring of the impression will be done using dental stone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bite registration will be done followed by mounting of stone casts on the articulator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's stone models and bite will be scanned using desktop scanner and the trial PMMA&#xD;
           bridge will be designed and 3D-printed as a verification jig to evaluate the accuracy of&#xD;
           the taken impression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Passivity of the trial PMMA bridge will be evaluated on patients intra-orally using&#xD;
           single screw test, peri-apical radiographs and Screw resistance parameter (SR&#xD;
           parameter).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regarding the final prosthesis a framework will be designed on the patient's scan and&#xD;
           milled from (PEEK blocks) , finished and polished then layered by (pink composite ) and&#xD;
           (composite teeth) will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Final prosthesis will be delivered to the patient and treatment time will be measured by&#xD;
           the number of visits starting from impression taking session till delivery session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow up of the patients will be done every at 3 and 6 months to check if there are any&#xD;
           prosthetic complications (screw loosening or fracture).&#xD;
&#xD;
      while in Group 2 ( intervention group):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intra-oral scanner will be used in the study to take a digital impression for the&#xD;
           implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3D printed generic Scan bodies with unified shape and length replacing the traditional&#xD;
           transfer copings will be press fitted on the trans-mucosal abutments and pickup&#xD;
           cylinders that are screwed on the implants to capture their position and intra-oral&#xD;
           scanning will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  With scan bodies in place, bite will be registered where, in case of completely&#xD;
           edentulous upper and lower arches a 3D printed centric holding device will be used to&#xD;
           fix the vertical dimension at the desired height and the intra-oral scanner will capture&#xD;
           the bite at this position, but in case of a completely edentulous arch opposed by&#xD;
           dentulous arch , a green stick jig will be customized anteriorly to hold vertical&#xD;
           dimension at the desired height and intra-oral scanner will be used to record the bite&#xD;
           bilaterally.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The STL file of the captured scan will be 3D-printed into a resin model with negative&#xD;
           places replicating the analogues design in which the digital analogues will be seated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The trial PMMA bridge will be designed on the implants scan then 3D- printed, to be&#xD;
           fitted on the resin model having digital analogues in place.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Passivity of the trial PMMA bridge will be evaluated on patients the same way as group&#xD;
           1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The final prosthesis a framework will be designed and milled as in group 1 then&#xD;
           delivered to the patient outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Passivity of PMMA tryin: will be measured by Single screw test, Periapical radiograph,&#xD;
           Screw resistance parameter (SR parameter) at PMMA tryin visit (2nd visit after&#xD;
           impressions Instantly).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prosthetic complications (screw loosening , prosthesis fracture) : will be measured by&#xD;
           Clinical examination at 3, 6 months of delivery of final prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment time : will be measured by Number of visits at the last visit.&#xD;
