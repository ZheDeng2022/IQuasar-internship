  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Through this clinical trial, the investigators aim to verify the usefulness and stability of&#xD;
      sentinel lymph node mapping in endometrial cancer of clinical stage I-II.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard treatment for endometrial cancer is total hysterectomy and bilateral&#xD;
      salpingo-oophorectomy, peritoneal cytology, and lymph node dissection. Pelvic lymph node&#xD;
      dissection helps to set accurate staging and adjuvant therapy group, but it has never been&#xD;
      proven to have therapeutic effects by itself. According to the results of two recent&#xD;
      randomized clinical trials, routine pelvic lymph node dissection in early stage endometrial&#xD;
      cancer doesn't improve survival rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine pelvic lymph node detection can cause complications in a large number of patients and&#xD;
      is associated with poor quality of life. Therefore, it is important to develop a method that&#xD;
      can check the status of the lymph node in a less invasive way. Efforts have been made to&#xD;
      preserve other lymph nodes with significantly less potential for metastasis through less&#xD;
      invasive methods, reducing lymph edema and complications such as bleeding and nerve damage&#xD;
      caused by excessive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sentinel lymph node dissection is used as a standard treatment for breast cancer and&#xD;
      malignant melanoma, and efforts to develop it have recently continued in endometrial cancer&#xD;
      and cervical cancer. A SENTICOL study conducted in cervical cancer patients showed a&#xD;
      false-negative rate of 0% when both were monitored lymph node dissection. In addition, unlike&#xD;
      routine pelvic lymph node dissection, ultra-staging through 0,2mm gas intercepts allow&#xD;
      additional detection of less than 2mm of microtransfer or less than 0.2mm of independent&#xD;
      tumor cells that have not been found before. In a recent large-scale prospective study of&#xD;
      endometrial cancer, sentinel lymph node mapping using indocyanine green and fluorescent&#xD;
      imaging was successful at 86%, and sensitivity (patient-by-patient analysis) reported 100% in&#xD;
      diagnosis of lymph node metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As laparoscopic and robotic surgery account for most of the treatment of endometrial cancer&#xD;
      patients, a good environment is created for monitoring lymph node exploration using ICG, and&#xD;
      sensitivity and detection rate seem to have improved compared to the previous method.&#xD;
      However, there has been no prospective study on the effects of patient clinical prognosis,&#xD;
      such as a standard treatment, pelvic lymph node resection, and disease-free survival rate,&#xD;
      and overall survival rate, so a prospective study is essential. The investigators compare&#xD;
      survival rates in the group that does sentinel lymph node mapping and routine pelvic lymph&#xD;
      node detection in endometrial cancer in clinical stage I-II.&#xD;
