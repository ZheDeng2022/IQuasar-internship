      To assess the impact of percutaneous renal access technique on outcomes of percutaneous&#xD;
      nephrolithotomy in management of renal stones by comparing the Triangulation and ''eye of the&#xD;
      needle'' (or bull's eye) and the stone targeted techniques in the following:-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Stone free rate (SFR) (primary outcome).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Complicatins of surgery (primary outcome).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Change in haematocrit pre and postoperative (secondary outcome).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Operative time (secondary outcome).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Duration of hospitalization (secondary outcome). .&#xD;
&#xD;
      7-Fluroscpic screening time (FST) (secondary outcome). . 8- Change in haematocrit pre and&#xD;
      postoperative (secondary outcome).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL) is an appropriate first-line alternative for the&#xD;
      management of kidney stones that are larger than 2 cm in diameter and that do not respond to&#xD;
      extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) [1,2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percutaneous renal access is the most important step in PNL, and the adequacy of access&#xD;
      directly affects the success and complication rates of this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among C-arm fluoroscopy, computed tomography (CT), and ultrasonography (US), C-arm&#xD;
      fluoroscopy is the most commonly used imaging technique to access the intrarenal collecting&#xD;
      system [3-4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various fluoroscopy techniques have been described for achieving a good access. One can use&#xD;
      fluoroscopy or ultrasonography or a combination of both for reaching the target calyx. Each&#xD;
      of it has its advantages and disadvantages, and no consensus exists showing the superiority&#xD;
      of one or the other [5].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Triangulation and ''eye of the needle'' (or bull's eye) techniques are two common methods to&#xD;
      obtain proper percutaneous renal access under fluoroscopy guidance [6-7].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiplanar fluoroscopic imaging is essential in both techniques to make a proper renal&#xD;
      puncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biplanar access is based on mediolateral and cephalad-caudal movements of the needle, with&#xD;
      the depth of the puncture adjusted based on different fluoroscopic projections, including&#xD;
      oblique, vertical, and 30Â° positions [6, 8].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most published studies of PCNL have focused on evaluating the effect of patient- and&#xD;
      stone-related factors such as success rate, extent of bleeding, complication rate,&#xD;
      fluoroscopic Screening times (FSTs), and operative time on outcomes. [9-10]&#xD;
&#xD;
      The imaging modalities used for guidance by urologists or radiologists during percutaneous&#xD;
      renal access and renal access procedures have also recently been analyzed and compared in&#xD;
      terms of outcomes and complications.[11-12]&#xD;
&#xD;
      These studies, however, have not considered the effect of percutaneous renal access technique&#xD;
      on outcome. Although the triangulation and the bull's-eye techniques have been evaluated and&#xD;
      compared using a biologic model in a published study [13], no clinical study comparing these&#xD;
      techniques has been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of percutaneous renal access technique on&#xD;
      outcomes of percutaneous nephrolithotomy in management of renal stones by comparing the&#xD;
      Triangulation and ''eye of the needle'' (or bull's eye) and the stone targeted technique .&#xD;
