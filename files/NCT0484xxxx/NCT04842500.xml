  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is meant to identify relations between the reinforcement histories of 80 adults&#xD;
      with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) and the prevalence of extinction&#xD;
      bursts. Extinction bursts, or temporary increases in rates and intensities of behavior during&#xD;
      extinction, often preclude the inclusion of extinction in intervention packages meant to&#xD;
      suppress severe challenging behavior, despite the fact that extinction is often necessary to&#xD;
      generate therapeutic outcomes. Study results will provide insight into how researchers can&#xD;
      enhance interventions for the severe challenging behavior of individuals with IDD while&#xD;
      mitigating the undesirable collateral effects (i.e., extinction bursts) of therapeutic action&#xD;
      (i.e., extinction). Expanded access to study results will be made available to those who&#xD;
      inquire after all data have been obtained and analyzed.&#xD;

      The Goal of this project is to identify mechanisms responsible for bursts, and to facilitate&#xD;
      strategic extensions toward discovery for treatments of challenging behavior. AIM 1: In the&#xD;
      service of this goal, the investigators aim to evaluate the accuracy of an efficient&#xD;
      alternative to demand-curve analysis (i.e., progressive ratio reinforcer analysis) in&#xD;
      quantifying reinforcer value (i.e., Pmax). AIM 2: Investigators also aim to evaluate the&#xD;
      utility of manipulating baseline reinforcement parameters for controlling bursts when those&#xD;
      manipulations are informed by the results of demand-curve analysis.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The investigators will enroll 80 adults with developmental disabilities in a low-stakes translational investigation employing a 2x2 factorial, crossed, and randomized matched blocks design, with batched randomization logic. Procedures will include: (a) matching participants within batches according to progressive ratio reinforcer analysis results, and (b) randomly assigning participants to one of four experimental conditions to determine whether information about reinforcer value can be used to set baseline parameters that either promote or eliminate bursts during extinction.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Peak response rate during extinction</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately post-baseline extinction challenges</time_frame>
    <description>This term describes the highest rate of responding observed during extinction and will be depicted as a proportion of baseline. For example, assuming the mean rate of responding during the final three sessions of baseline is 3 responses per minute (i.e., [2.8 rpm + 3.2 rpm + 3 rpm] / 3 = 3 rpm), and the highest rate of responding during a single session of extinction is 3.4 rpm, then peak response rate for this hypothetical individual would be 1.13 (i.e., 3.4 / 3 = 1.13). This value will serve as the primary dependent variable for each participant in all between-groups comparisons in our data-analysis plan.</description>

    <time_frame>Immediately post-baseline extinction challenges</time_frame>

    <measure>Overall session duration</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-assessment</time_frame>
