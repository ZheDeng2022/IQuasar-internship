      The investigators plan to conduct a 3-year pioneering care research project for mucositis in&#xD;
      cancer patients. These include: (1) an analysis of the incidence and severity of mucositis,&#xD;
      severity, treatment methods, and treatment costs; (2) an RCT comparing the effectiveness of&#xD;
      honey, Taiwan green propolis, and usual care in mucositis of cancer patients; (3) monitoring&#xD;
      of related symptom changes using a smart bracelet device; (4) a measurement of IL-1, IL-6,&#xD;
      IL-10, and TNF, Microbiota in saliva, Microbiota in stool and (4) modeling of the trend of&#xD;
      mucositis for alertness and search of essential parameters of the complications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mucositis is common among cancer patients receiving radiotherapy and chemotherapy. A total of&#xD;
      80-100% of the patients are suffering from the mucositis pain; their regular dieting is&#xD;
      disturbed, nutritional status deteriorated, and even treatment discontinued. Some self-paid&#xD;
      medications like glutamine have been used to prevent mucositis before and during&#xD;
      radiotherapy/chemotherapy. However, the cost of glutamine is relatively high (NT15,000&#xD;
      month/person) and its treatment efficacy and side effects are still to be determined.&#xD;
      Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and experiments have shown that honey and propolis may be&#xD;
      used for the management of mucositis. Taiwan is a country of rich agriculture with unique bee&#xD;
      products among which the longan honey demonstrates the most significant antibacterial&#xD;
      effects; the green propolis has also been proved to comprise antibacterial,&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects. However, none of these propolis products have&#xD;
      been specifically trialed for the management of mucositis of cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bee products have been concerned as potential sources of natural antioxidants such as&#xD;
      flavonoids, phenolic acids, and terpenoids. Their potential treatment effects have caught the&#xD;
      attention of the medical community. Accumulating evidence is supporting the use of bee&#xD;
      products in mucositis caused by chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or both. However, systematic&#xD;
      review and meta-analysis have suggested a low quality of the included RCTs, and this affects&#xD;
      the applicability of the evidence in the real clinical scenario.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to conduct a 3-year pioneering care research project for mucositis in&#xD;
      cancer patients. These include: (1) an analysis of the incidence and severity of mucositis,&#xD;
      severity, treatment methods, and treatment costs; (2) an RCT comparing the effectiveness of&#xD;
      honey, Taiwan green propolis, and usual care in mucositis of cancer patients; (3) monitoring&#xD;
      of related symptom changes using a smart bracelet device; (4) a measurement of IL-1, IL-6,&#xD;
      IL-10, and TNF Microbiota in saliva, Microbiota in stool and (4) modeling of the trend of&#xD;
      mucositis for alertness and search of essential parameters of the complications. In the first&#xD;
      year, our project will focus on the analysis of the incidence and severity of mucositis,&#xD;
      treatment methods, and treatment costs. In the second year, the planned RCT will be carried&#xD;
      out and changes in heart rate, stress, and fatigue of the patients are to be collected using&#xD;
      the smart bracelet. In the third year, the investigators will conduct a deep machine learning&#xD;
      of the clinical and serial test data to predict the changes in symptoms. The modeling is&#xD;
      anticipated to provide important parameter combinations that assist the alerting of possible&#xD;
      severe complications. The overall findings of this project shall the strategical references&#xD;
      for applying bee products in the prevention and treatment of mucositis in cancer patients.&#xD;
