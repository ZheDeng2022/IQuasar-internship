      A tape is applied over the inguinal skin nerves in people with low back pain. When placing&#xD;
      the experimental tape, mobility should be improved and when the area is cooled with the tape,&#xD;
      rotation should be limited again by inhibiting skin receptors. When returning to the initial&#xD;
      temperature, you should improve the degrees of mobility again demonstrating that Magnetic&#xD;
      tape only acts on the dermal receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The possible variation of the range in movement is measured with the validated program for&#xD;
      the measurement of angles, Kinovea® program. A kinesiology tape was used as a placebo tape&#xD;
      and the magnetic tape was used in a randomized experimental way.&#xD;

      Detailed Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A triple-blind cross-sectional observational study is designed where subjects with low back&#xD;
      pain will be selected and blinded to receive the Magnetic Tape® (tape with magnetic effects&#xD;
      of less than 2 Gauss) or placebo Tape. Likewise, the evaluator who puts the Magnetic Tape®&#xD;
      does not know what material he is using, as it is supplied by another researcher. The patient&#xD;
      does not know what tape will be placed on him.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recommendations of the &quot;Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology&quot; (STROBE) will&#xD;
      be followed. All participants will receive a participant information sheet and sign informed&#xD;
      consent. Patients aged 18 to 65 years with low back pain will be recruited from different&#xD;
      private clinics in the city of Valencia, Spain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that when Magnetic Tape® comes into contact with electromagnetic fields&#xD;
      such as those generated by living beings, due to the movement of electrical charges (ions),&#xD;
      as defined by Ampere's Law, the domains of the tape are oriented or aligned in parallel with&#xD;
      the external magnetic field creating a magnetic flux with a north pole and a south pole. This&#xD;
      generated field in turn produces a magnetic induction proportional to the variation of the&#xD;
      magnetic flux, as defined by the Faraday Law.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This electric potential produces a redistribution of the electric charge (ions) generating a&#xD;
      magnetic field due to the orientation of the tape domains, then exerting a force on the&#xD;
      moving charges within the electrolyte.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiological, Lorentz's Law, regulating Magnetic Tape® aberrant electromagnetic fields.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol for data collection will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing the informed consent and data protection, the groups with low back pain will be&#xD;
      formed that will receive the application of both Magnetic Tape® and the intervention of a&#xD;
      placebo tape. To avoid that the order of the intervention influences the results of the&#xD;
      study, the subjects will be randomized into two different groups, Group A and Group B. Group&#xD;
      A will receive Magnetic tape® and Group B will do the opposite. The next day the other tape&#xD;
      will be applied&#xD;
&#xD;
      Passive joint ROM of both hips is assessed by placing the patient in a supine position with&#xD;
      90º hip and knee flexion, performing passive internal hip rotation. The video camera and&#xD;
      infrared thermometer are located perpendicular (ceiling) to the ipsilateral knee and hip to&#xD;
      make recordings and measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recording equipment and the infrared thermometer are placed on the subject at a&#xD;
      sufficient height to frame the iliac fossa to be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After recording the passive hip rotation maneuver, the joint ROM will be assessed using the&#xD;
      Kinovea® program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the same movement, the muscle activation of the movement antagonist ipsilateral&#xD;
      adductor longus will be assessed with the surface electromyograph so that it is not&#xD;
      activated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The local temperature variation of the ipsilateral iliac fossa will also be assessed with the&#xD;
      infrared thermometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, a 5-8 cm long by 5 cm wide strip of Magnetic Tape® will be placed over the&#xD;
      ipsilateral iliac fossa of the hip with movement limitation to perform the passive internal&#xD;
      rotation of the hip again and record the degrees of range of motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, a cold pack will be placed on the tape to inhibit the nerve receptors in the area and&#xD;
      measurements of passive internal hip rotation and temperature of the area will be performed&#xD;
      every minute, removing the cold pack for two seconds to measure temperature, until rotation&#xD;
      is limited again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To conclude, the cold pack will be permanently removed to return the area to the initial&#xD;
      temperature and the passive internal hip rotation will be recorded again with the tape.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be your control since one day a tape will be placed and the next day the&#xD;
      other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neither application has to be painful.&#xD;
