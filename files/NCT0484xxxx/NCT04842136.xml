  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to assess and compare the relationship between jaw function, neck&#xD;
      disability, sleep quality, fatigue, and headache in patients with myofascial&#xD;
      Temporomandibular Disorder (TMD) with Sleep Bruxism (SB) and without (non-SB).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was conducted on TMD patients who were willing to participate in the study between&#xD;
      January and December 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The case-control study included patients diagnosed with myofascial TMD by dental&#xD;
      practitioners at regional hospitals referred for physiotherapy. Total of 200 myofascial TMD&#xD;
      patients, comprising 91 identified as SB and 109 as non-SB were included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Jaw Function Limitations Scale (JFLS), Neck Disability Index (NDI), Pittsburgh Sleep&#xD;
      Quality Index (PSQI), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT-6) scales&#xD;
      and indexes were used for both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of Sleep Bruxism (SB) on jaw function, neck problems, sleep quality, fatigue, and&#xD;
      tension headache were evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interactions of these factors and the importance of taking SB into consideration when&#xD;
      evaluating and treating patients with TMD were examined.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of pain in muscles was measured in centimeters using a 0-10 Visual Analogue Scales (VAS). The scale ranges from 0 = &quot;no pain at all&quot; to 10 = &quot;intolerable pain&quot;</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Jaw Functional Limitation Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Jaw Functional Limitation Scale-20 was used to assess jaw function in the masticatory system. The scale consists of a total of 20 items with three constructs. Each item is scored from 0-10, with 0 indicating no restriction and 10, severe restriction. A total of ≥5 indicates jaw function limitation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Neck Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Neck problems were assessed with Neck Disability Index (NDI). It is a scale of 10 sections with total points ranging from 0-50. Higher scores indicate severe pain, and a score of ≥5 indicates a neck disorder.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The sleep quality was evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The scale comprises a total of 24 items in 7 sub-scales. The total points of the 19 items that score from 0-21, with a total of ≥5 indicating poor sleep quality.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue Severity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of fatigue on functional and behavioral aspects was evaluated by the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). The total score is calculated as the average of the 9 item scores -the lower the total score, the lower the fatigue level. A cut-off value of ≥4 has been defined for fatigue</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Headache Impact Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Headache Impact Test-6 (HİT-6) was used to assess the headache. The 6 items scale evaluating the frequency, the degree of restriction to daily life and social life, and changes in the mood because of headache. The total score 50-59 reflects important impact, and scores ≥60 indicate severe impact.</description>
