      To Determine the safety and Effectiveness of Kybella for the treatment of Flank Fat (FF)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center study of the safety and efficacy of Kybella for the treatment of&#xD;
      subcutaneous adipose in the flank area (flank fat).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each qualified subject will undergo treatment with Kybella in the flank region for the&#xD;
      reduction of flank fat.. Prior to treatment, the principal investigator will evaluate the&#xD;
      severity of the subcutaneous adipose deposition of the flanks. Subjects will also have an MRI&#xD;
      of the flanks at screening and week 12. .. Flank digital images will be taken prior to&#xD;
      treatment and at each subsequent visit. The subjects will complete a safety and injection&#xD;
      site response (ISR) diary beginning on the evening of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will return at Week 6 for additional treatment if warranted by the treating&#xD;
      investigator. Subjects will be contacted via a phone call within 72 hours after each&#xD;
      injection. Subjects will be seen at Week 6, 10, 12 and 18 (EOS) after initial treatment, at&#xD;
      which time the subject will undergo photography and the investigator will rate treatment&#xD;
      improvement (GAIS). The investigator will evaluate the treatment area for any adverse events&#xD;
      (AEs). MRI study will be done at screening and at week 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will return 6 weeks after initial treatment, and the principal investigator will&#xD;
      determine if a touch-up treatment is warranted. If deemed necessary, a touch-up treatment may&#xD;
      be administered Digital photography will be captured prior to treatment and following&#xD;
      treatment. The subject will return 4 weeks after the touch-up to undergo digital photography&#xD;
      and for the principal investigator to assess safety/improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After initial treatment routine follow-up visits for safety and effectiveness will occur at&#xD;
      Week 6, 10, 12, and 18 (EOS). A phone call will occur within 72 hours following injection. At&#xD;
      all follow-up visits, digital photography will be captured and the investigator will rate&#xD;
      treatment improvement (GAIS).. At screening and at Week 6, 10, 12 and 18 (EOS) subjects will&#xD;
      complete the satisfaction of flank region questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study will be to assess the feasibility and efficacy of injecting Kybella&#xD;
      for the treatment of subcutaneous fat of the flank region.&#xD;
