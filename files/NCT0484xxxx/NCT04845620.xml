    <measure>The proportion of all randomized subjects who attain IGA Success</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>IGA Success, defined as a vIGA-AD score of 'clear' or 'almost clear' PLUS a 2-grade improvement from Baseline. The vIGA-AD is a static evaluation of qualitative overall AD severity. This global assessment scale is an ordinal scale with five severity grades (reported only in integers of 0 to 4 where 0 is clear).</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <measure>Among subjects with baseline WI-NRS â‰¥ 4, the proportion of subjects who attain a 4 point reduction in the WI-NRS</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>WI-NRS is a subject/caregiver reported severity of itch at its highest intensity during the previous 24-hour period. The scale is from '0 to 10' (&quot;no itch&quot; to &quot;worst imaginable itch&quot;).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The proportion of subjects who attain at least a 75% (percent) reduction in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>EASI combines the assessment of the severity of lesions and the area affected into a single total score in the range 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease). To calculate the EASI, the sum of the severity rating (0 to 3 with 3 being the most severe) for four clinical signs are multiplied with the numerical value of the area affected and with the percentage of the four body areas.</description>
