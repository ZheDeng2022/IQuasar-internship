  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery bypass graft surgery is the standard surgical treatment for coronary disease.&#xD;
      However, there is no consensus on analgesic management in patients undergoing CABG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to evualuate efficacy of bilateral transversus thoracis muscle plane&#xD;
      (TTMP) block combined with systemic analgesia, compared to systemic analgesia only, in&#xD;
      patients undergoing elective on-pump CABG surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our main hypothesis is that a bilateral TTMP block performed after CABG surgery could reduce&#xD;
      morphine consumption during the first 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators conducted an age, gender and type of surgery-matched retrospective cohort&#xD;
      study in the Montpellier University Hospital (France).&#xD;

    <description>In the &quot;TTMP block&quot; group, an ultrasounded guided TTMP block was performed by an anesthesiologist, in ICU, before tracheal tube removal. Between the 4th et 5th rib, on each side, 40 ml of Ropivacaine 2 mg/ml, in association with Clonidine, was injected &quot;single-shot&quot; in the tranversus thoracis muscle plane. The targets of local anesthetic were the anterior branches of intercostal nerves from T2 to T6. Dexamethasone 8 mg was injected intravenously.</description>
