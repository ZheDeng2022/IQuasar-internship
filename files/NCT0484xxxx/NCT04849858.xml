    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out which type of transversus abdomens plane&#xD;
      (TAP) and block (bupivacaine, liposomal bupivacaine or liposomal bupivacaine with re-dosing&#xD;
      at 48-60 hours) improves your pain control and lowers your risk of post-operative common side&#xD;
      effects of surgery and narcotic pain medications.&#xD;

      The purpose of this research study is to find out which type of TAP block (bupivacaine,&#xD;
      liposomal bupivacaine or liposomal bupivacaine with re-dosing at 48-60 hours) improves your&#xD;
      pain control and lowers your risk of post-operative common side effects of surgery and&#xD;
      narcotic pain medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An anesthesiologist participating on this study will describe the TAP block to you during&#xD;
      your preoperative interview and will obtain your consent for the block procedure with your&#xD;
      anesthesia consent prior to the procedure. TAP blocks are one of the various methods of&#xD;
      controlling your pain after surgery. They are typically placed with an anesthetic agent, such&#xD;
      as bupivacaine. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently approved a&#xD;
      longer-acting form of the anesthetic used in this study, liposomal bupivacaine. Although both&#xD;
      medications, bupivacaine and liposomal bupivacaine are approved by the FDA, there are only a&#xD;
      few trials such as this one, in the United States, comparing the various types of TAP blocks.&#xD;
      No studies exist comparing the re-dosing of a TAP block, as we will be doing in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the standard of care after a gynecologic procedure may or may not include&#xD;
      receiving a TAP block. This was a decision typically made, with your consent, at the&#xD;
      discretion of an anesthesiologist and your surgeon. As per the standard of care, after&#xD;
      surgery, you would be given oral pain medications to control your pain and intravenous pain&#xD;
      medications for severe breakthrough pain. Our study will not change your post-operative pain&#xD;
      medication schedule or timing. It will only study the effectiveness of the TAP block you get&#xD;
      in controlling your pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though the medicines (bupivacaine or liposomal bupivacaine) used in this study are&#xD;
      FDA-approved, the use of these drugs in this study is investigational.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a prospective cohort study with retrospective data analysis. Patients will be assigned to treatment groups on a consecutive basis. We will be recruiting 45 eligible patients from our University of California Irvine (UCI) gynecologic oncology clinic. Each clinic patient who is scheduled for surgery will be screened for eligibility. The first 15 patients enrolled will receive perioperative plain bupivacaine transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks. The next 15 patients enrolled will receive perioperative single-dose Liposomal Bupivacaine (LB) TAP blocks. The final 15 patients enrolled will receive perioperative LB TAP blocks followed by redosing of the TAP blocks in 48-60 hours.</intervention_model_description>
