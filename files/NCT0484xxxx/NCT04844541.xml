      This study aims to establish an adaptive platform trial to enable the evaluation of&#xD;
      investigational products for early treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19. The&#xD;
      platform trial design will allow for products to be incorporated into the protocol as&#xD;
      additional arms, as products are identified and become available. Initially all eligible&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled in a &quot;non-interventional&quot; arm, described here. This master protocol&#xD;
      describes the core study elements that will be maintained across all study arms.&#xD;
      Interventional design elements will be added in a subsequent amendment to the master&#xD;
      protocol, and interventional arms will be added in amendments as product specific appendices.&#xD;
      PROTECT-APT will be conducted as a multi-site study coordinated centrally by the Henry M&#xD;
      Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine.&#xD;
