  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the dental changes, periodontal health and the pulp vitality in&#xD;
      mini-screw supported en-masse retraction associated with traditional or flapless corticotomy&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      40 adult patients exhibiting class II division 1 malocclusion requiring upper first premolar&#xD;
      extractions followed by en-masse retraction will participate in the study. They will be&#xD;
      randomly and equally distributed into two groups: traditional corticotomy (20 patients)&#xD;
      versus flapless corticotomy (20 patients). The corticotomy procedure will be performed&#xD;
      pre-retraction. The dental changes will be assessed using dental casts. The impressions will&#xD;
      be taken after finishing the leveling and alignment phase and before starting the en-masse&#xD;
      retraction (T0), 1 month (T1), 2 months (T2), 3 months (T3), 4 months (T4), and 5 months (T5)&#xD;
      following the onset of en-masse retraction. The final impression will be considered at the&#xD;
      end of the en-masse retraction (when the canines reach Class Ι relationship).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the most important challenges in daily practice is prolonged orthodontic treatment&#xD;
      duration. For that lots of therapeutic procedures have been introduced to minimize&#xD;
      orthodontic treatment time such as surgical interventions. Even though the traditional&#xD;
      corticotomy with flap elevation proved to be effective in accelerating different types of&#xD;
      tooth movement, it has been deemed aggressive. Therefore, minimally invasive surgical&#xD;
      techniques have been proposed and labeled 'flapless corticotomies'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In flapless corticotomy group, vertical soft-tissue incisions will be made on the buccal and&#xD;
      palatal gingiva by using a blade N.15. One incision will be made between the roots of the six&#xD;
      upper anterior teeth, and two incisions will be made between the upper canines and second&#xD;
      premolars. The incisions will be 5 mm long and started 4 mm apical to the interdental&#xD;
      papilla. Then a piezosurgery knife will be inserted to perform the cortical alveolar&#xD;
      incisions with 3-mm in-depth and 8-mm in length. No suturing will be needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In traditional corticotomy group, a full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap will be elevated&#xD;
      including the interdental papilla, and extended from the distal side of the second premolar&#xD;
      on the right side to the same position on the left side without performing any vertical&#xD;
      releasing incisions. The full-thickness flap will be extended 3 mm above the root apices,&#xD;
      from the buccal and palatal sides, knowing that the incision in the incisal papilla region&#xD;
      will be done around it with a (V) or (U) shape. Then, one vertical incision between the roots&#xD;
      of upper anterior teeth and two vertical incisions in the site of first premolar extraction&#xD;
      will be made by the piezosurgery knife. The vertical incisions will be connected by a&#xD;
      horizontal incision using the piezosurgery knives. The vertical incisions will be 3 mm in&#xD;
      depth, starting 2-3 mm apical to the alveolar crest, and extending 3 mm beyond the root&#xD;
      apices. The interrupted technique of suturing will be done using a non-absorbent 3-0 black&#xD;
      silk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The en-masse retraction will be begun 4 days after carrying out the corticotomy procedure&#xD;
      using 0.019×0.025-inch SS archwires with 8-10-mm long soldered hooks located distal to the&#xD;
      lateral incisors. NiTi closed coil springs with 9-mm long will be extended from the&#xD;
      mini-screws to the soldered hooks and applied 250-g of force per side. The patients'&#xD;
      follow-up appointments will be every 2 weeks. The force will be measured on every appointment&#xD;
      and adjusted if needed. The endpoint of the monitoring period will be the session when&#xD;
      canines reached a class Ι relationship.&#xD;

    <time_frame>The calculation of the rate of retraction will be done once the retraction procedures finish. It is expected to happen within 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of en-masse retraction of upper anterior teeth (mm/month) in each group will be calculated.&#xD;
This outcome will be measured by the following steps:&#xD;
Drawing a projection from the upper canine apex to the middle palatal bone line.&#xD;
Drawing a projection from the upper central incisor edge to the middle palatal bone line.&#xD;
Drawing a projection from the mesial ending of the third palatal rugae to the middle palatal bone line.&#xD;
