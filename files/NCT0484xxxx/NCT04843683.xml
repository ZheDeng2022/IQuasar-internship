  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center, phase II trial that will be monitoring the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of using stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SBRT) to treat patients with a medical&#xD;
      condition affecting heart rate and rhythm (refractory arrhythmias) within the University&#xD;
      Health Network (Princess Margaret Cancer Centre and Toronto General Hospital). The primary&#xD;
      objective will be to prospectively monitor patient cardiac outcomes following SBRT.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from Baseline in ICD therapies.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 18 months follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>Patient cardiac outcomes will be evaluated by changes from baseline in ICD (Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator) therapies (ICD shock frequency) following radiotherapy at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months of follow-up.</description>

    <description>Patient cardiac outcomes will be evaluated by changes from baseline in the number or dose of antiarrhythmic medications following radiotherapy at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months of follow-up.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to 18 months follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-Reported Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) will be assessed at each 1, 3, 6, 12 and 18 month follow-up, using the following assessment questionnaires: 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36).</description>

    <measure>Measure patient quality-of-life during the study.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 18 months follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-Reported Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) will be assessed at each 1, 3, 6, 12 and 18 month follow-up, using the following assessment questionnaire: the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A). A lower score indicates a better outcome.&#xD;
HADS-A Scoring: 0-7 = Normal, 8-10 = Borderline abnormal (borderline case), 11-21 = Abnormal (case).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measure patient subjective distress following treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Patient subjective distress following treatment will be measured at baseline, and 1 month and 6-months follow-up, using the Impact of Events Scale (IES-R). A higher score indicates a worse outcome.&#xD;
IES-R Scoring: 24 or more = Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a clinical concern. 33 and above = This represents the best cutoff for a probable diagnosis of PTSD. 37 or more = This is high enough to suppress immune system's functioning.</description>

    <intervention_name>Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy</intervention_name>
    <description>Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SBRT) is a type of radiation treatment that delivers precise, high dose radiation to targeted areas. In this study, a single treatment of SBRT will be delivered to the abnormal area of a participant's heart that is causing dangerous heart rate and rhythm changes (arrhythmia).</description>
