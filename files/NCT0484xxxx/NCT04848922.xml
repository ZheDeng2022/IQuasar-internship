      The aim of this study to determine the effect of hot showers on postpartum fatigue, mood and&#xD;
      comfort in women giving vaginal birth. 136 women, who were between 6 and 12 hours postpartum,&#xD;
      were assigned to intervention and control groups by computer randomization. Visual Similarity&#xD;
      Scale for Fatigue, Visual Analogue Scale, Postpartum Comfort Questionnaire and Brief Mood&#xD;
      Insight Scale were used to collect data. The women in the intervention group were allowed to&#xD;
      take a shower in a standing position at a water temperature of 37-41°C for 10-20 minutes. In&#xD;
      the control group, routine care was provided.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Evidence has been limited on the effect of hot showers on postpartum fatigue, mood, and&#xD;
      comfort in women giving vaginal birth. This study aimed to determine such effects in a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial conducted in a hospital in Turkey. Participants were recruited&#xD;
      from a hospital located in the Nigde province in the Central Anatolia region in Turkey. The&#xD;
      data of the research were collected between 9 April 2018 and 13 February 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Puerperal women who had given birth in vaginal way and who were in the maternity ward of the&#xD;
      hospital and who were between 6 and 12 hours postpartum were included in the study. The&#xD;
      computer-generated randomization list was prepared by an independent biostatistician using&#xD;
      the PASS program (PASS 11.0.4, NCSS, LL. Kaysville, Utah, and USA). Women who met the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria were randomized into intervention group (IG) and the control group (CG)&#xD;
      based on age and parity status (through one-to-one matching) by computer. A total of 128&#xD;
      volunteers, 64 in each group, were included in the study in order to be able to determine an&#xD;
      effect size of 0.5 between the two groups, with an error risk of α = 0.05 and 80% power ratio&#xD;
      to represent the medium effect size using Cohen's (1988) effect size. However, it was&#xD;
      predicted that there might be withdrawals during the study, and 136 women, 68 in each group,&#xD;
      were included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Puerperium Introduction Form (PIF), Puerperium Follow-Up Form (PFF), Visual Similarity Scale&#xD;
      for Fatigue (VSSF), Visual Analogue Scale for Fatigue and Disomfort (VAS-F and VAS-D),&#xD;
      Postpartum Comfort Questionnaire (PPCQ) and Brief Mood Insight Scale (BMIS) were used to&#xD;
      collect data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first interview, 6 and 12 hours postpartum, PIF, VAS for fatigue and discomfort, and&#xD;
      VSSF were filled in for the puerperal women in the Intervention Group (IG) and Control Group&#xD;
      (CG). In the CG, women were provided routine care practices in the postnatal care unit of the&#xD;
      hospital. In the IG, in addition to the routine care practices of the clinic, a hot shower at&#xD;
      a standing position was provided. The temperature of the water was adjusted according to the&#xD;
      preferences of the women to between 37 and 41 °C with a digital shower thermometer, and the&#xD;
      women were allowed to shower for 10-20 minutes in a standing position. After the shower&#xD;
      procedures, the information on and individual views of the puerperal women were recorded in&#xD;
      the PFF. One hour after the completion of the hot shower procedure, the VAS for fatigue and&#xD;
      discomfort, the VSSF, the PPCQ, and BMIS were filled in for the final test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS 25.0 software. Chi-square and t statistical tests&#xD;
      were used to to determine whether the socio-demographic and obstetric characteristics. For&#xD;
      numerical variable comparisons between groups were evaluated using two independent samples&#xD;
      t-test for variables that provide normal distribution assumption, and the Mann-Whitney U test&#xD;
      for variables that do not provide a normal distribution assumption. For numerical variables,&#xD;
      the comparisons of the groups over time were made with Repeated Measures ANOVA. The&#xD;
      Bonferroni test was used as a multiple comparison test. In cases where p &lt;.05, the difference&#xD;
      between groups was considered statistically significant.&#xD;

    <time_frame>At baseline and an hour after intervention, fatigue was assessed.</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue assessed using by The Visual Similarity Scale for Fatigue (VSSF) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS-F).&#xD;
The Visual Similarity Scale for Fatigue (VSSF) consists of 18 items in two sub-dimensions, comprising fatigue (13 items) and energy (5 items) sub-dimensions. The scale consists of 10-cm horizontal lines that contain positive expressions at one end and negative expressions at the other end. The intersection point at the marked location is evaluated objectively by measuring it with a ruler separately for each question. The score range in the sub-dimension of fatigue is 0-130.&#xD;
Visual Analog Scale (VAS-F) is a scale on a 10 cm long vertical line with two ends named differently (0 = I am not tired and 10 = I am extremely tired). The distance between the marked point and the lowest end of the line (0 = I'm not tired) is measured in centimeters and the numerical value found indicates the patient's fatigue severity.</description>

    <measure>Comfort Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>PPCQ was assessed an hour after intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Comfort assessed using by Postpartum Comfort Questionnaire (PPCQ). Postpartum Comfort Questionnaire (PPCQ) which is a five-point likert type scale, has 34 items and the total score is 34-170. The scale has three sub-dimensions: &quot;physical, psycho-spiritual and sociocultural&quot;. The comfort score is expressed as the average value, obtained by dividing the total score by the number of items. The average value found is shown in a distribution of 1 (low comfort) to 5 (high comfort).</description>

    <measure>Discomfort Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>VAS-D was assessed at baseline and an hour after intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Discomfort assessed using by Visual Analog Scale for Discomfort (VAS-D). Visual Analog Scale for Discomfort (VAS-D) is a scale on a 10 cm long vertical line with two ends named differently (0 = No discomfort and 10 = Extremely discomfort). The distance between the marked point and the lowest end of the line (0 = No discomfort) is measured in centimeters and the numerical value found indicates the patient's discomfort severity.</description>

    <measure>Mood Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>BMIS was assessed an hour after intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Brief Mood Insight Scale (BMIS) which is likert type scale, has 16 items with four scores (1 (absolutely not) -4 (absolutely feel)) and the total score is 8-32. High scores for both subscales indicate high positive or negative mood.</description>
