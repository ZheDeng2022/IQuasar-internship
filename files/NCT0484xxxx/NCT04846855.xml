    <textblock>
      Peripheral loco-regional anesthesia (LRA) for anesthetic purposes is a technique widely used&#xD;
      in adults for upper limb surgery. In pediatrics, LRA is not classically considered on its&#xD;
      own. It is usually performed for analgesic purposes during sedation or general anesthesia. It&#xD;
      is entirely possible to carry out awakened peripheral blocks in communicating children, of&#xD;
      school age, thus avoiding the issues of GA in pediatrics, in particular in an emergency&#xD;
      context. The use of Emla anesthetic skin patches for punctures (perfusion and LRA) as well as&#xD;
      the viewing of cartoons on touch tablets during treatment can improve the perception of&#xD;
      painless care such as LRA and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In pediatrics, only ropivacaine at a concentration of 0.2% has Marketing Authorization in&#xD;
      pediatrics in children under 12 for the production of peripheral blocks. On the basis of the&#xD;
      experience of the Claude Galien Private Hospital in this area, it seems interesting to assess&#xD;
      the feasibility of upper limb surgery under anesthetic LRA alone with a dose of ropivacaine&#xD;
      at the concentration 0.35% in communicating children, of school age.&#xD;

      Peripheral loco-regional anesthesia (LRA) for anesthetic purposes is a technique widely used&#xD;
      in adults for upper limb surgery. It allows peripheral surgeries to be performed without&#xD;
      putting the patient to sleep and thus avoiding certain disadvantages of general anesthesia&#xD;
      (GA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In pediatrics, LRA is not classically considered on its own. It is usually performed for&#xD;
      analgesic purposes during sedation or GA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject to respecting a strict protocol and taking advantage of considerable developments in&#xD;
      the field of LRA, it is entirely possible to carry out awakened peripheral blocks in&#xD;
      communicating children, of school age, thus avoiding the pitfalls of GA in pediatrics, in&#xD;
      particular in an emergency context (inhalation on a full stomach, respiratory risk in&#xD;
      children with colds, inhalational anesthesia with an anxiety mask, postoperative vomiting&#xD;
      nausea, disorientation and delusions upon waking ...) Indeed, the exclusive use of&#xD;
      ultrasound, the use of adapted needles, the improvement of knowledge in sono-anatomy, the&#xD;
      reduction in doses and concentrations of local anesthetics are all developments in the field&#xD;
      of LRA allowing to improve the conditions of safety, comfort for the patient and success of&#xD;
      the technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beyond technical considerations, there are ways to improve the child's experience with care.&#xD;
      The use of Emla anesthetic skin patches for punctures (perfusion and ALR) as well as the&#xD;
      viewing of cartoons on touch tablets during treatment can improve the perception of painless&#xD;
      care such as ALR and treatment. charge in the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In pediatrics, only ropivacaine at a concentration of 0.2% has Marketing Authorization in&#xD;
      pediatrics in children under 12 for the production of peripheral blocks. Higher&#xD;
      concentrations of ropivacaine, used in several pediatric studies, have nevertheless shown&#xD;
      their good tolerance and their efficacy Under reserve not to exceed 3mg / kg and to use&#xD;
      concentrations up to 0.5% On the basis of these arguments, and with the experience of the&#xD;
      Claude Galien Private Hospital in this area, it seems interesting to assess the feasibility&#xD;
      of upper limb surgery under anesthetic ALR alone with a dose of ropivacaine at the&#xD;
      concentration 0.35% in communicating children, of school age.&#xD;
