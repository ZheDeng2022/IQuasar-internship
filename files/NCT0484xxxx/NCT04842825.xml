  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the early stage, our team found that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) intervention aimed&#xD;
      at Nourishing kidney and regulating blood circulation in vitro fertilization and embryo&#xD;
      transfer(IVF-ET) can improve the clinical pregnancy rate. In order to further study the role&#xD;
      of TCM in improving the pregnancy outcome of IVF-ET in infertility due to decreased ovarian&#xD;
      reserve (DOR). A randomized controlled clinical trial was used in this study. 200 infertile&#xD;
      patients with DOR were randomly divided into two groups. The control group was treated with&#xD;
      conventional modern medicine, and the treatment group was treated with traditional Chinese&#xD;
      herbs on the basis of conventional modern medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention started from the 5th day of the first menstrual cycles after enrollment and&#xD;
      lasted for three months before IVF-ET. After the transplantation, the TCM treatment continues&#xD;
      for 14 days. The number of oocytes, antral follicles, anti-Mullerian hormone(AMH), serum&#xD;
      follicle-stimulating hormone(FSH), and clinical pregnancy rate will be observed to evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of traditional Chinese medicine on the improvement of ovarian function, pregnancy&#xD;
      outcome, and fertility of DOR patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted on patients with DOR attending our reproductive medicine centre&#xD;
      for proposed IVF-ET between January 2021and December 2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is designed as a randomised, controlled clinical trial with two groups established&#xD;
      by 1:1 equal allocation, a treatment group with interventions using herbs to tonify the&#xD;
      kidneys and regulate blood and a control group treated using conventional Western medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Random numbers will be prepared by an independent third-party statistician who prepared a&#xD;
      list of random group codes for this study. Enrolled subjects will be given a subject number&#xD;
      during the screening process and, upon formal enrolment, will be randomly assigned to either&#xD;
      the test or control group with a corresponding random number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment method Phase I: The control group will be treated with conventional Western&#xD;
      medicine, whereas the treatment group will receive sequential treatment with the Chinese&#xD;
      herbal formula 2 months before the proposed embryo transfer(ET) to regulate menstruation and&#xD;
      improve ovarian reserve function. Treatment with the Chinese herbal formula will start on the&#xD;
      5th day of menstruation after entering the super-ovulation cycle. The medicines used will be&#xD;
      Er Zhi Wan combined with Si Wu Tang (Radix et Rhizoma Ligustrum 15 g, Radix Morindae Sinensis&#xD;
      12 g, Fructus Lycii 15 g, Semen Cuscutae 20 g, Radix Rehmanniae 20 g, Radix Angelicae&#xD;
      Sinensis 10 g, Radix Paeoniae Alba 12 g, Radix Yam 20 g); which will be taken for 10-15days.&#xD;
      After ovulation, the herbs used to warm the kidney and regulate the blood will be changed to&#xD;
      Er Xian Promoting Pregnancy Decoction with Si Wu Decoction (Curculus 10 g, Xianling spleen 15&#xD;
      g, Morinda officinalis 15 g, Cuscutae 20 g, Amethyst 15 g, Rehmannia 20 g, Angelica 15 g,&#xD;
      Chuanxiong 10 g); which will be taken for 10-15days. The hospital will be responsible for the&#xD;
      decoction of 200 mL per dose, 1 dose per day, divided into 2 doses in the morning and in the&#xD;
      evening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: After ET, the control group will be treated conventionally with no TCM intervention,&#xD;
      and the treatment group will continue to take Chinese herbal medicine, changing to tonifying&#xD;
      the kidney, regulating blood, and calming the foetus, using Shou Foetus pill combined with Si&#xD;
      WuTang with addition and subtraction (Cuscuta 15 g, Sambucus 15 g, Chuan Guan Gong 10 g,&#xD;
      Agaricus 9 g, Shu Di 15 g, Angelica 10 g, Bai Shao 12 g), which will be taken until the 14th&#xD;
      day of transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication Patients that meet the inclusion criteria will be assigned to one of two groups&#xD;
      according to a randomisation table after completing the relevant tests and signing the&#xD;
      informed consent form. The control group will be treated routinely, and the treatment group&#xD;
      will begin taking the assigned drugs on the 5th day (with no intervention drugs taken on days&#xD;
      1-4) of menstruation for two menstrual cycles before IVF until the day of ET and then&#xD;
      continue the intervention for 14 days after ET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up plan Blood tests to measure progesterone and human chorionic gonadotropin(hCG) will&#xD;
      be performed 14 days after fresh or frozen ET. If the blood results confirm pregnancy, a&#xD;
      clinical pregnancy will be confirmed after 2 weeks by vaginal ultrasound. When a gestational&#xD;
      sac is seen in the uterus, the presence or absence of ectopic pregnancy and the number of&#xD;
      implanted foetuses will be determined. Those with clinical pregnancy will be followed for&#xD;
      final pregnancy outcome (miscarriage/live birth, week of delivery, and a number of&#xD;
      new-borns), delivery (mode of delivery and pregnancy complications), and offspring (sex,&#xD;
      weight, length, presence of birth defects, and stillbirth). Follow-up will be limited to&#xD;
      subjects with transferred embryos obtained from egg retrieval in this study. In the case of&#xD;
      subject withdrawal or dropout from the study, detailed reasons will be recorded.&#xD;
