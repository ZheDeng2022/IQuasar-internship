  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause multiple system function disorders, and&#xD;
      complicated symptoms last for an extended period. The virus can cause this continued&#xD;
      infection, or the virus causes immune system function disorder and post-infectious autoimmune&#xD;
      disease. The clinical symptoms can be smell loss, taste loss to liver function disorder,&#xD;
      kidney function failure, different. No matter how complicated the systems showed in the&#xD;
      clinic, all of the symptoms are due to the specific cells being damaged. Our clinical study&#xD;
      is focused on recovering the damaged structure and function of the cells that could restore&#xD;
      the organ function back to normal or close to normal&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SARS-CoV-2 caused sequela is a pathological condition, and specific cells are damaged from a&#xD;
      prior disease, injury, or attack. Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (PASC) is&#xD;
      caused by an infection of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 virus. The virus or virus-triggered&#xD;
      disorder immunity attacks target tissue(s) and organ(s). No matter name of the virus and the&#xD;
      cells, tissue(s), or organ(s), they all belong to the category of antigen and cause an immune&#xD;
      response; this can induce inflammation or not depending on the immune system tolerance .&#xD;
      While older patients may have an increased risk of developing severe disease or sequelae,&#xD;
      young survivors have also reported symptoms months after acute infection of SARS-CoV-2,&#xD;
      reported by the British Lung Foundation. Some infected people, referred to as long-haulers,&#xD;
      experience a long period of symptoms. Characterization of the etiology and pathophysiology of&#xD;
      late sequelae is underway and may reflect organ damage from the acute infection phase;&#xD;
      manifestations of a persistent hyperinflammatory state even perform as autoimmune diseases.&#xD;
      Rheumatic disease can also occur during the infection of COVID. Ongoing viral activity&#xD;
      indicates an inadequate antibody response. Factors in addition to acute illness that may&#xD;
      further complicate the picture include physical deconditioning at baseline or after a long&#xD;
      disease course, pre-COVID-19 comorbidities, and psychological sequelae following a long or&#xD;
      difficult disease course relating to lifestyle changes due to the pandemic. Likely, the&#xD;
      persistent sequelae of COVID-19 represent multiple syndromes resulting from distinct&#xD;
      pathophysiological processes along the spectrum of disease. So far, no specific medicine has&#xD;
      been identified for treating the COVID-19 virus and post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2. Due to&#xD;
      the difficulty treating either SARS-CoV-2 or its caused sequelae, there is a very pessimistic&#xD;
      suggestion: People must live with COVID-19 forever. Most people who contract coronavirus&#xD;
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection recover entirely within a few weeks. However, the&#xD;
      long-haulers continue to experience symptoms after their initial recovery. This condition has&#xD;
      been called post-COVID-19 syndrome or &quot;long COVID-19.&quot; Older people and people with many&#xD;
      severe medical conditions are the most likely to experience lingering COVID-19 symptoms, but&#xD;
      even young, otherwise healthy people can feel unwell for weeks to months after infection. The&#xD;
      most common signs and symptoms that linger over time include fatigue, shortness of breath,&#xD;
      cough, joint pain, and chest pain. Other long-term signs and symptoms may include muscle pain&#xD;
      or headache, fast or pounding heartbeat, loss of smell or taste, memory and concentration or&#xD;
      sleep problems, and rash or hair loss, the Mayo Clinic reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virus infections have been long associated with autoimmune diseases, whether multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis, diabetes, or myocarditis. Three potential mechanisms for virus-induced autoimmune&#xD;
      disease or virus-induced immunopathology are molecular mimicry, bystander activation, and&#xD;
      persistent virus infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those prolonged symptoms are consistent with the internal physical pathological process. That&#xD;
      can be the virus infection continuing, or the infection triggered an immune reaction in one&#xD;
      or more physical locations when a person became infected with the COVID-19 virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here is the critical point: when the structure of cells is destroyed, the result is the&#xD;
      affected cell's function will be lost. Does the etiology directly destroy the antigen, or the&#xD;
      virus trigger the disorder immunity to destroy the antigen? The results are the same: the&#xD;
      antigen is under inflammation. Returning the damaged cells (antigen) to normal or close to&#xD;
      normal states is the key to saving lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This raises questions concerning how can we protect those cells from becoming damaged and how&#xD;
      can we return injured cells to their normal function? Regardless of whether the cell has been&#xD;
      damaged directly by the virus infection, or another reason like disordered immunity, my&#xD;
      clinical research will show how to solve those medical problems.&#xD;
