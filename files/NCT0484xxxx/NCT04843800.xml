  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that 23% of Quebecers suffer from chronic low back pain, and that 12% are&#xD;
      disabled by this condition. Despite medical advances, the origin of so-called 'nonspecific&#xD;
      low back pain' remains enigmatic. Conventional imaging methods by computed tomography and&#xD;
      magnetic resonance may provide information on vertebral structures. However, very often, they&#xD;
      do not diagnose lesions that genuinely correlate with the patient's symptoms. The lack of&#xD;
      accurate diagnosis limits the therapeutic management in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, patients are increasingly turning to alternative and complementary medicine&#xD;
      therapies (e.g., acupuncture, chiropractic , osteopathy, shiatsu) to relieve their pain.&#xD;
      These therapies target painful areas of abnormal hardening in muscles of the lower back and&#xD;
      aim to release the tension in these tissues to control pain. However, these painful areas and&#xD;
      their resolution after manual therapy have yet to be demonstrated by means other than manual&#xD;
      palpation. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial in chronic low back pain patients to&#xD;
      examine the effects of acupuncture, chiropractic therapy and therapeutic massage on lower&#xD;
      back muscular and connective tissues' physical properties using innovative ultrasound&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a phase II, prospective, randomized controlled study, which will have received&#xD;
      IRB approval and will be registered at Clinicaltrials.gov before it begins. Participants with&#xD;
      chronic non specific low back pain (NSLBP) will be recruited from one site. On the day of the&#xD;
      registration visit, the participants will meet with the research assistant to review and sign&#xD;
      the consent form, give clinical and demographic data and respond to validated outcome&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will then undergo a research dynamic ultrasound (US) of the lower back. One&#xD;
      musculoskeletal radiologist will perform the US exams consisting of a series of 5 dynamic&#xD;
      scans of both the right and left paraspinal muscles, obtained during passive flexion of the&#xD;
      lower body. Following the US exam, the participants will be randomized in three groups&#xD;
      (allocation 1:1). One group will receive a standardized acupuncture treatment and another&#xD;
      group will receive a standardized chiropractic treatment. One treatment session per week for&#xD;
      3 consecutive weeks will be provided. Following the 3 treatment sessions, at week 4, the US&#xD;
      exam will be repeated and the questionnaires will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third group will be placed on a waiting list for 3 weeks and will be reexamined by US and&#xD;
      respond to the questionnaires at week 4. Then, the participants will undergo a standardized&#xD;
      therapeutic massage treatment with one treatment session per week for 3 consecutive weeks.&#xD;
      Following the 3 treatment sessions, at week 7, the US exam will be repeated and the&#xD;
      questionnaires will be administered.&#xD;

    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory short form (BPI-sf) is a self-administered questionnaire used to assess the severity of a patient's pain and the impact of this pain on the patient's daily functioning. The BPI-sf includes the four pain severity items (worst pain in last 24 hours, least pain in last 24 hours, pain on average, pain right now) and the seven interference items (general activity; mood; walking ability; normal work including housework; relations with other people; sleep; enjoyment of life). Each item is scored on an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS) where 0 indicates no pain and 10 indicates worst pain imaginable. There is no scoring algorithm. The arithmetic mean of the four severity items will be used as measures of pain severity; the arithmetic mean of the seven interference items will be used as a measure of pain interference. The minimum and maximum values are 0 and 10 respectively. A higher score represents a worse outcome.</description>

    <description>The chiropractic treatments will consist of one 20-minute session weekly, for 3 consecutive weeks. The Diversified technique is one of the most commonly practiced techniques by chiropractors. In the treatment of low back pain, this technique involves the application of a quick (high-velocity), short (low-amplitude) thrust (adjustment) to the lombo-pelvic area.</description>

    <description>The therapeutic massage treatments will consist of one 45-minute session weekly, for 3 consecutive weeks. A technique called Fascial Release will be used. Tension related to back pain is believed to be present not only in the back but also in various parts of the body such as the legs, through the connection of fascia, the membrane that surrounds the muscles. The purpose of this treatment is to reduce the tension connected to the lower back.</description>
