  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess the safety of the drug enoxacin at specific dose levels in adults with&#xD;
      ALS.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomized to one of three doses of enoxacin (200, 400, or 600mg twice&#xD;
      daily) for 30 days. On day 1, 7, 14, 21, and 30 of treatment and at a follow-up visit 14 days&#xD;
      after the last dose, participants will be assessed for safety measures and blood will be&#xD;
      collected to assist with the determination of enoxacin pharmacokinetics (PK) and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics (PD). On day 1 and day 30 of dosing, participants will only take one dose of&#xD;
      study medication (the morning dose) to assist with determination of enoxacin single dose PK&#xD;
      over a 24-hour period. A lumbar puncture (LP) to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for PD&#xD;
      assessments will occur on day 1 and day 30.&#xD;
