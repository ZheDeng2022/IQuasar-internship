  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is an indispensable tool for tissue acquisition for pancreatic&#xD;
      lesions. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) is once considered as the first line diagnostic method&#xD;
      especially when rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) by cytopathologist is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, FNA alone has several limitations including inadequate acquisition of cells, and&#xD;
      unable to provide core tissue for further histological analysis. Furthermore, ROSE is not&#xD;
      available in many endoscopic centres due to limited resources. Endosonographers around the&#xD;
      world, are discovering methods to overcome the limitations, including the use of new on-site&#xD;
      evaluation technique by endoscopists, new fine-needle biopsy (FNB) needles, contrast-enhanced&#xD;
      harmonic EUS-guided FNB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators propose to compare the diagnostic performance between&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced EUS-guided FNB versus conventional EUS-guided FNB technique with an aim to&#xD;
      define the best EUS-guided tissue acquisition technique in the absence of ROSE. Results&#xD;
      obtained from this research is expected to have significant impact in providing new insights&#xD;
      on the best EUS-guided tissue acquisition method. It may replace FNA with ROSE as the gold&#xD;
      standard for EUS-guided tissue acquisition in an affordable manner. It will also save the&#xD;
      patients from unnecessary procedures and fasten the treatment pathways.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seicean et al, in a prospective study, evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of EUS-FNA with&#xD;
      CH-EUS using SonoVueTM versus EUS-FNA without CH-EUS. They found that the diagnostic accuracy&#xD;
      of EUS-FNA with CH-EUS was higher than that of EUSFNA without CH-EUS (86.5% vs 78.4%).&#xD;
      However, the difference did not reach the threshold required for statistical significance.&#xD;
      Also, only FNA, but not FNB, was performed in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FNB needle was introduced to further improve upon EUS guided tissue sampling. It is&#xD;
      designed to collect a larger amount of core sample tissue with preserved histological&#xD;
      architecture for further analysis, including molecular analysis. Also the FNB needle has been&#xD;
      shown to obtain samples with higher cellularity compared to the standard FNA needles.&#xD;
      Compared with EUS-FNA, EUS-FNB had a better specimen adequacy, higher diagnostic accuracy,&#xD;
      and fewer number of needle passes but no increase in complications rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technique of macroscopic on-site evaluation (MOSE) has recently been advocated for&#xD;
      estimating the adequacy of a core specimen obtained by EUS for histological diagnosis. MOSE&#xD;
      involves immediate examination of the FNB specimen for the presence of a &quot;macroscopic visible&#xD;
      core&quot; (MVC), which is defined as whitish or yellowish pieces of tissue with an apparent bulk.&#xD;
      The total length of the MVC is then measured and the optimal cut-off MVC length was 4 mm.&#xD;
      This study demonstrated that EUS-FNB with MOSE provided comparable diagnostic yield as&#xD;
      EUS-FNB without MOSE (92.6% vs 89.3%) with fewer numbers of passes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Puncturing avascular or necrotic area of a tumour could be the major reason of false negative&#xD;
      rate during EUS-guided FNB. Contrast-enhanced harmonic EUS (CH-EUS) can define avascular or&#xD;
      necrotic area inside a tumour which may improve the false negative rate during EUS-FNB. In&#xD;
      this study, the investigators aim to evaluate the diagnostic performance of CH-EUS-guided FNB&#xD;
      with MOSE for solid pancreatic masses. The investigators expect the study will define the&#xD;
      best EUS-guided tissue acquisition technique in the absence of ROSE and replace FNA with ROSE&#xD;
      as gold standard for tissue sampling for solid pancreatic masses.&#xD;

After infusion, the point of puncture will be determined when the parenchyma of the pancreas was enhanced.

    <description>Patients will undergo EUS FNB with the 22-gauge FNB needle (Acquire®, Boston Scientific Natick, MA). After each pass, the needle is removed and the stylet will be introduced into the needle to extrude any aspirated material on a glass slide for inspection of the presence of a macroscopic visible core (MVC). The total length of the MVC will be measured before placement into a formalin bottle. EUS-FNB is completed if the obtained MVC is longer than 4mm and deemed adequate by endoscopist. If the obtained MVC is &lt; 4mm, the procedure is repeated until a MVC of ≥ 4mm is obtained and deemed adequate by endoscopist. A maximum of 7 passes is allowed</description>
