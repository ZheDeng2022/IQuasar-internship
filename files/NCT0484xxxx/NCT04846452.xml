    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, prospective, exploratory clinical study aiming to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety profile of sintilimab combined with anlotinib hydrochloride and&#xD;
      platinum-containing dual-agent chemotherapy regimens in advanced or metastatic NSCLC as&#xD;
      first-line treatment. Totally 40 patients with negative driver genes (20 patients of squamous&#xD;
      cell carcinoma, 20 patients of non-squamous cell carcinoma) are to be enrolled.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sintilimab (200 mg intravenously, once every 3 weeks; Cinda Bio-Suzhou Co., Ltd., Suzhou,&#xD;
      Jiangsu, China) and anlotinib hydrochloride (12 mg orally, once daily before breakfast; CTTQ,&#xD;
      Lianyungang, Jiangsu, China) are to be administered as first-line therapy in NSCLC. Besides,&#xD;
      patients with non-squamous NSCLC will also receive pemetrexed and cisplatin or carboplatin.&#xD;
      Meanwhile, patients with squamous NSCLC will also receive albumin paclitaxel and carboplatin.&#xD;
      Patients assessing as CR/PR/SD will continue to receive a maintenance treatment after 4-6&#xD;
      cycles of treatment. Patients with non-squamous NSCLC will be treated with sintilimab +&#xD;
      anlotinib hydrochloride + pemetrexed chemotherapy regimen while patients with squamous NSCLC&#xD;
      will be treated with sintilimab + anlotinib hydrochloride to maintain treatment for 2 years&#xD;
      until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, death, and patient request for&#xD;
      discontinuation or starting new anti-tumor treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observations and assessments will be conducted before treatment, on day 7, 21 of cycle 1, on&#xD;
      day 21 of cycle 2, every 2 cycles (42 days) during the following cycles, and after treatment.&#xD;
      Follow-up for survival status and subsequent antineoplastic therapy data collecting will be&#xD;
      performed by telephone interview or face-to-face every 6 weeks after treatment until disease&#xD;
      progression, death, or end of the study (whichever occurs first).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be divided into two stages: the safety lead-in period and the preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy evaluation period. The first stage is the safety lead-in period. 3 patients with&#xD;
      squamous NSCLC and 3 patients with non-squamous NSCLC will be enrolled to evaluate the&#xD;
      combined therapy safety. The first 6 patients will continue to be observed from the beginning&#xD;
      of the combined treatment until the 6th patient has been treated for 2 cycles (6 weeks). If&#xD;
      there are less than or equal to 2 patients with intolerable side effects, they will enter the&#xD;
      next stage. A total of 40 patients (20 patients with squamous NSCLC, 20 patients of&#xD;
      non-squamous NSCLC) will be enrolled, and the safety and efficacy of the combined treatment&#xD;
      will be initially evaluated. All statistics will be analyzed by statistical analysis software&#xD;
      (SAS) 9.2 (or higher version). The single-sided 0.05 superiority hypothesis test will be used&#xD;
      to test statistics and the comparison between groups will give a 95% confidence interval and&#xD;
      p-value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy is to be analyzed in the full analysis set (FAS), the response evaluable set (RES),&#xD;
      and the per-protocol set (PPS). Safety is to be analyzed in safety set (SS) including all&#xD;
      assigned patients who receive at least one dose of study combined therapy and have safety&#xD;
      records of medication. Statistical descriptions of subject distribution, demographic data,&#xD;
      and baseline characteristics will be performed. For study endpoints, the Kaplan-Meier method&#xD;
      is to be applied for the PFS and OS curve with estimation for median PFS, median OS, and 95%&#xD;
      CI. ORR= (CR+PR) / sample size×100%; DCR= (CR+PR+SD) / sample size×100%. The 95% CI of the&#xD;
      ORR and DCR is to be calculated by an exact binomial method based on the F distribution. For&#xD;
      safety analysis, only treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) will be included and analyzed&#xD;
      in this experiment, which is defined as AEs that are post-dose or heavier than the baseline.&#xD;
      Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), system organ class (SOC), preferred&#xD;
      terms (PT) and NCI CTCAE 5.0 will be used to standardize and classify all adverse events and&#xD;
      summarize the incidence of AEs and association with treatments.&#xD;
