    <textblock>
      This is a research that will investigate the safety and efficacy of virgin coconut oil (VCO)&#xD;
      as an adjunctive therapy for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a randomized controlled trial among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, aged&#xD;
      18 years old and above, admitted at the Philippine General hospital. Patients will be grouped&#xD;
      into the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group receiving standard of care&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group receiving standard of care plus virgin coconut oil (15ml, 3x/day for 2 weeks) as&#xD;
           adjunctive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be observed as regards to primary outcomes such as recovery/resolution of&#xD;
      symptoms and duration of hospital stay&#xD;
