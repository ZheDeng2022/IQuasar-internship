    <textblock>
      This is a single-center prospective cohort study of predictive factors related to prognosis&#xD;
      of ischemic stroke due to large-artery atherosclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From March 1, 2021 to December 31, 2026, 1000 patients with ischemic stroke due to&#xD;
      large-artery atherosclerosis who are admitted to the Department of Neurology or Neurosurgery,&#xD;
      Tongji Hospital are going to be recruited. Detailed clinical data in emergency room and&#xD;
      in-hospital will be obtained from the medical record reviews, and the National Institutes of&#xD;
      Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score will be done by certified&#xD;
      neurologists to assess the severity of the disease in acute stage and treatment outcome&#xD;
      during the follow-up. All cases will undergo routine blood tests, brain magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) and cerebral vascular examination, such as TCD, CTA, HRMR or DSA. The&#xD;
      investigators will analyze the in-hospital factors that could predict the outcome to provide&#xD;
      more evidence-based suggestions in the treatment and prognosis of atherosclerotic ischemic&#xD;
      cerebrovascular disease.&#xD;

      The detaited information about this trial is described below&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Quality assurance: The research proposal is reviewed by an Independent Research Panel.&#xD;
           If the proposal is approved, access to the study data is provided in a secure data&#xD;
           sharing environment after receipt of a signed Data Sharing Agreement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data check: Researchers must submit a proposal to conduct a scientifically relevant&#xD;
           analysis of the study data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Source data verification: Medical records, electronic case report forms, and imaging&#xD;
           would be processed by certified neurologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Data included:&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.1 Baseline Variables: NIHSS and mRS scores before ischemic stroke 4.2 In-hospital&#xD;
           Variables: 4.2.1 Main symptoms（1=facial paralysis 2=limb weakness 3=limb numbness&#xD;
           4=facial numbness 5=lalopathy 6=ataxia 7=dysphagia 8=bulbar paralysis 9=dizziness&#xD;
           10=nausea and vomit 11=vision disorder 12=confusion 13=headache 14=unconsciousness&#xD;
           15=others） NIHSS and mRS scores after admission 4.2.2 Brain CT and ASPECT scores 4.2.3&#xD;
           DWI 4.2.4 CTA, MRA, DSA, carotid artery ultrasound andTCD to evaluate the stenosis&#xD;
           degree of large vessels 4.2.5 HRMR to evaluate the changes of the plaque of intracranial&#xD;
           stenosis 4.2.6 Blood routine tests 4.2.7 HbALc and FBG 4.2.8 LDL HDL ApoA1 and ApoB&#xD;
           4.2.9 Cardiac TnI and NT-proBNP 4.2.10 Proteomic analysis of fresh plasma 4.2.11&#xD;
           Histopathological tissues and transcriptomics of CEA&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Standard Operating Procedures 5.1 Patient recruitment: From March 1, 2021 to December&#xD;
           31, 2026, 1000 patients with ischemic stroke due to large-artery atherosclerosis who are&#xD;
           admitted to the Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Tongji Hospital are going to&#xD;
           be recruited 5.2 Data collection: Detailed clinical data in emergency room and&#xD;
           in-hospital will be obtained from the medical record reviews, and the National&#xD;
           Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score will be&#xD;
           done by certified neurologists to assess the severity of the disease in acute stage and&#xD;
           clinical outcome during the follow-up. All cases would undergo routine blood tests,&#xD;
           brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cerebral vascular examination, such as TCD,&#xD;
           CTA, HRMR or DSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.3 Data management, The research data is reviewed by an Independent Research Panel.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.4 Data analysis: Biostatisticians from the Department of Neurology, Tongji Hospital,&#xD;
           Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology will conduct&#xD;
           statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Sample size assessment: About 1000 cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Plan for missing data: The number of lost cases will be treated as the deleted value and&#xD;
           the lost rate will be indicated. Complete sample intentionality analysis and&#xD;
           intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis would be performed on the end points. During the&#xD;
           analysis, if there is a statistical difference in the results, the number of&#xD;
           participants lost in the exposed group will be deleted, and the number of participants&#xD;
           lost to in the non-exposed group will be added. If there is still a statistical&#xD;
           difference in the results, the loss of follow-up will not have an impact on the analysis&#xD;
           results of this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Statistical analysis: All statistical data would be analyzed by the SPSS Software 24.0&#xD;
           version. Continuous variables would be reported as median (range, minimum-maximum),&#xD;
           which would be compared by Mann-Whitney test, and categorical data would be represented&#xD;
           as percentages and frequencies, which would be compared by the two-tailed Fisher's exact&#xD;
           test or one-way ANOVA. P&lt;0.05 would be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
