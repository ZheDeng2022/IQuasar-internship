    <textblock>
      The present study is a pilot study that aims to evaluate the feasibility, validity, and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of three psychological treatment components for pain after breast&#xD;
      cancer, which will be evaluated in a larger trial following completion of the present pilot&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present pilot study is a precursor for a following larger trial and aims to evaluate the&#xD;
      i) feasibility, ii) validity, and iii) preliminary efficacy of the three treatment components&#xD;
      that will be further investigated in a subsequent larger trial. The present pilot study will&#xD;
      employ the same design as will be used in the subsequent larger trial, namely the Multiphase&#xD;
      Optimization Strategy (MOST). Specifically, in the subsequent larger trial, MOST will be used&#xD;
      to evaluate the efficacy and change processes of three psychological treatment components&#xD;
      selected from so-called &quot;third wave&quot; cognitive therapies (CTs), which have been shown to be&#xD;
      efficacious in the treatment of pain after breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall hypothesis is that the selected third wave CT components will target key&#xD;
      maintaining psychological factors in pain, thus leading to reductions in the primary outcomes&#xD;
      of pain intensity and -interference. Specifically, we hypothesize that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mindful attention practices will increase attentional control (i.e., the ability to&#xD;
           intentionally focus and intentionally shift one's attention), thereby reducing pain&#xD;
           hypervigilance, leading to reductions in pain intensity and -interference.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Decentering practices will reduce fusion with thoughts (i.e., getting caught up in one's&#xD;
           thoughts and acting automatically in response to thoughts), thereby reducing pain&#xD;
           catastrophizing, leading to reductions in pain intensity and -interference.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Values and committed action (i.e., behavior linked to values and goals) will increase&#xD;
           acceptance of discomfort and reduce avoidant behavior, leading to reductions in pain&#xD;
           intensity and -interference.&#xD;
