      The primary objective of this study is to assess safety and feasibility of pre-operative&#xD;
      nivolumab in combination with either cabiralizumab, anti colony stimulating factor 1 receptor&#xD;
      (CSF1R) or BMS-986253 (anti-interleukin-8) in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of head&#xD;

             limited to oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx, paranasal sinuses, nasal&#xD;
             cavity). Squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary, diagnosed in lymph nodes in neck,&#xD;
             can be included but should be tested for p16 and confirmed with an HPV specific assay&#xD;
             (testing NOT required for enrollment; can be done at an interval).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be human papillomavirus (HPV) negative (confirmed testing for&#xD;
             oropharyngeal primary tumors - if otherwise suspected HPV positivity e.g. some oral&#xD;
             cavity or sinonasal tumors if e.g. absence of smoking) OR (if HPV+) be high risk based&#xD;

             multidisciplinary team including a surgeon, a medical oncologist and a radiation&#xD;
             oncologist. Resection should typically be definitive but may also be done for&#xD;
             symptomatic control e.g. in the setting of (suspected) metastatic disease with&#xD;
             dominant local symptoms.&#xD;

             years of smoking) are allowed, as long as patients have an indication for surgery for&#xD;
             locoregional disease, and a life expectancy of ≥6 months. Metastatic disease can be&#xD;
             addressed with additional treatments after trial treatment, e.g. focal radiation, or&#xD;
             additional systemic therapy (e.g. chemotherapy or as indicated a targeted therapy or&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Males who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for&#xD;
                  method(s) of contraception as outlined in protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient understands the study regimen, its requirements, risks and discomforts and is&#xD;

&#xD;
        However, patients with metastatic disease (both HPV(-) and high-risk HPV(+) (i.e. ≥20 pack&#xD;
        years of smoking) are allowed, as long as patients have an indication for surgery for&#xD;
        locoregional disease, and a life expectancy for ≥6 months. Metastatic disease can be&#xD;

             either a) abnormal liver function tests (=elevated aspartate aminotransferase/alanine&#xD;
             aminotransferase) or b) ongoing use of an antiviral hepatitis treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;

                  aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase) and no antiviral medication per&#xD;
                  definition do not have an active infection and are eligible to enroll without&#xD;
                  additional testing).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with normal liver function test do NOT need additional Hepatitis (no&#xD;

             medications within 14 days of study start. However, inhaled or topical steroids and&#xD;
             adrenal replacement steroid doses &lt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent, are permitted&#xD;
             in the absence of active autoimmune disease. Also, a burst of steroids (≤10 days use,&#xD;
             e.g. a contrast premedication, or a methylprednisolone dose pack or similar) are&#xD;
             acceptable and not excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) positive head and neck cancer (e.g. EBV(+) nasopharyngeal&#xD;
             carcinoma)&#xD;
&#xD;
