  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to understand how Amisulpride is taken up and distributed around the&#xD;
      body and how quickly it is eliminated, when given by mouth and into a vein in adults with&#xD;
      severe kidney disease. In addition it is important to understand how well tolerated&#xD;
      Amisulpride is in this patient population. Healthy adults will be studied to provide a&#xD;
      comparison.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label, non-randomised, pharmacokinetic study in&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 adult subjects with severe renal impairment and end-stage renal disease (i.e., eGFR &lt;&#xD;
           30 mL/min/1.73 m2) without dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 matched healthy subjects (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be given a single dose of 10 mg IV Amisulpride, followed by a single dose&#xD;
      of 10 mg oral Amisulpride given 24 hours later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be admitted to the clinic on Day -1. Dosing will start the following day (Day&#xD;
      1). Serial blood samples will be taken during Days 1-3 to assess the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      Amisulpride. Subjects will remain in clinic over the duration of the study and will be&#xD;
      discharged when the final blood sample is drawn on Day 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tolerability /safety of Amisulpride will be assessed by clinical chemistry and&#xD;
      haematology assessments, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECG), physical examination and&#xD;
      adverse event reporting.&#xD;
