  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the COVID-19 outbreak context, people living with rare diseases have been highly troubled&#xD;
      with anxiety, loneliness, and depression. The project evaluates resilience and coping&#xD;
      strategies to address pandemic impact by discussion in a dedicated focus group using a&#xD;
      web-based platform. The goal is to improve, in a sustainable manner, the coping skills and&#xD;
      psychological well-being of children, adolescents, and young adults affected by rare skeletal&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      March 11th, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic&#xD;
      accordingly with the spread and size of the infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The restrictions implemented by the governments have substantially changed people's&#xD;
      lifestyles, facilitating the emergence of emotions such as fear, anxiety, and a sense of&#xD;
      loneliness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The age groups most involved by these burdens have been childhood, adolescence, and young&#xD;
      adults. These groups have experienced dramatic changes in their daily life in order the&#xD;
      relational, educational, and social networks. Nonetheless, these links outline the ideal&#xD;
      environment for the development of resilience and the promotion of coping strategies to face&#xD;
      traumatic events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These lifestyle challenges and their consequences are even more evident in the context of the&#xD;
      rare diseases since the outbreak containment measures have emphasized the troubles with which&#xD;
      people affected by these conditions are daily forced to confront, in terms of access to care&#xD;
      and treatments, resulting in increased stress and anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current phase represents a sensitive step for the resumption of the activities in charge&#xD;
      of the health and social service aimed at the citizens and especially to people with special&#xD;
      needs, such as people suffering from rare diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pandemic experience has promoted new forms of meeting and contact between individuals&#xD;
      using web-based platforms, playing a fundamental role in preserving the community and&#xD;
      &quot;sociality&quot; dimensions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this scenario, the rare diseases could be an attractive model since the pandemic impinges&#xD;
      over their bio-psycho-social characteristics at different levels. Resilience and coping&#xD;
      strategies adopted by rare diseases patients could configure as an exemplum to face the&#xD;
      psychological distress resulting from anti-pandemic measures, suggesting new approaches of&#xD;
      taking charge by health service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study evaluates resilience and coping strategies to address pandemic impact by&#xD;
      discussion in a dedicated focus group using a web-based platform. The goal is to improve, in&#xD;
      a sustainable manner, the coping skills and psychological well-being of children,&#xD;
      adolescents, and young adults affected by rare skeletal diseases.&#xD;
