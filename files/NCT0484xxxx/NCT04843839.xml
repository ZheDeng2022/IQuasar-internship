      CHED- Congenital Endothelial Endothelial Dystrophy is a condition that causes corneal&#xD;
      cloudiness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since, currently only surgery is being done to cure this condition, we are taking up the&#xD;
      research of using topical eye drops for this condition which is a very simple and easy&#xD;
      method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, there are no significant side effects to this treatment.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corneal endothelial cell loss is often associated with blinding endothelial corneal&#xD;
      dystrophies: relatively seen more frequently dominantly inherited (5%) FECD (Fuchs&#xD;
      Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy) and rare recessive CHED1. Mutations of SLC4A11, an abundant&#xD;
      corneal solute transporter, cause CHED and some cases of FECD. SLC4A11 is a unique member of&#xD;
      the SLC4 family of bicarbonate transport proteins localized at the basolateral surface of&#xD;
      corneal endothelial cells that contributes to osmotically-driven water flux from the stroma&#xD;
      to aqueous humour to maintain corneal fluid-balance2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While mutations and loss of functional SLC4A11 are reported to be associated with&#xD;
      degeneration and death of endothelial cells, the detailed physiological roles of SLC4A11&#xD;
      still remain unknown. Seventy-eight different mutations, including 42- missense, 9- nonsense,&#xD;
      4- splice sites, and 23 insertion-deletion mutations, have been scattered across the gene&#xD;
      reported in families with CHED from Indian populations3. Current therapeutic interventions&#xD;
      Penetrating keratoplasty, Descemet's Stripping Automated Endothelial Keratoplasty (DSAEK),&#xD;
      and Descemet's Membrane Endothelial Keratoplasty (DMEK) face problems such as shortage of&#xD;
      donor corneas, complex surgical procedure, and incidence of graft failure in acute and&#xD;
      chronic phases4, 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When studied in model cells, the most common molecular phenotype of mutant membrane proteins&#xD;
      is mild misfolding. This biosynthetic defect renders the protein incapable of transit from&#xD;
      the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) site of synthesis to its normal cellular location. Note that&#xD;
      SLC4A11 localization in corneas of endothelial dystrophy patients has not been examined; the&#xD;
      conclusion of ER retention presently rests on data from cell culture models. Correcting such&#xD;
      biosynthetic defects is an attractive therapeutic approach for some genetic diseases&#xD;
      affecting membrane proteins, best exemplified by the efficacy of the drug, Lumacaftor, in&#xD;
      rescuing the cell-surface misfolded cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator&#xD;
      (CFTR), the protein product of the cystic fibrosis (CF) gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, there is an urgent need to find alternative therapy, which is reliable, simple and&#xD;
      affordable. A lot of interest has being taken now a day in opting for a non-invasive way of&#xD;
      modality over invasive ones. In SLC4A11 mutation corneal dystrophies, one such topic of&#xD;
      interest is the hypothesized role of Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAID's) as a&#xD;
      medical management of corneal endothelial dystrophies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most SLC4A11 mutations lead to biosynthetic defects marked by accumulation of the protein in&#xD;
      the Endoplasmic Reticulum, and their degradation before reaching the plasma membrane. This&#xD;
      generated increased reactive oxygen species thus making the cell more vulnerable to oxidative&#xD;
      and mitochondrial damage and more prone to apoptotic death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small-scale drug screen showed that Glafenine, a disused NSAID, was able to move some&#xD;
      SLC4A11 mutants to the cell surface, suggesting that other NSAIDs might also have therapeutic&#xD;
      potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, the retained protein in the Endoplasmic reticulum and the effects of various drugs&#xD;
      on its expression to the surface was taken up by studies conducted by Alka et al on HEK293&#xD;
      cells expressing CHED and FECD mutation. They showed the efficacy of Diclofenac (Voltaren&#xD;
      Ophthalmic) and Nepafenac over other NSAIDs in moving the endoplasmic reticulum-retained&#xD;
      missense mutant SLC4A11 in 20 out of 30 test cells. Which showed a potential role of NSAIDs&#xD;
      in these conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is thus to screen NSAIDs available as eye drops for their ability to correct the&#xD;
      cell-surfacing trafficking of SLC4A11 proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since their first introduction in ophthalmology, the use of NSAIDs have been exponentially&#xD;
      expanded, from therapeutic applications including treatment of pain and inflammation&#xD;
      associated with ophthalmic surgeries, to prevention and treat cystoid macular edema (CME)&#xD;
      associated with cataract surgery, enhance mydriasis intraoperatively and in multiple&#xD;
      inflammatory ophthalmic diseases, such as seasonal allergic conjunctivitis, viral&#xD;
      conjunctivitis, uveitis, episcleritis and scleritis, as well as in retinal and choroidal&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main reason for this being that they are- (i) Easy to handle (ii) Non-invasive, (iii)&#xD;
      Well-tolerated (iv) Sufficient ocular drug concentrations, while avoiding the systemic side&#xD;
      effects associated with oral administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, the ocular drug bioavailability in the conventional topical formulations is&#xD;
      notoriously poor, as only 1-5% of drug applied to the surface penetrates the cornea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides these ocular anatomical and physiological constraints, another limiting factor&#xD;
      encountered with anti-inflammatory drugs or immunosuppressive agents is their poor water&#xD;
      solubility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prodrug approach is a chemical way to enhance drug permeability. The synthesized inactive&#xD;
      prodrug exhibits a better corneal penetration and once in situ, is either chemically and/or&#xD;
      enzymatically metabolized to become active. It was studied that, nepafenac, an amide prodrug&#xD;
      of amfenac, belonging to the pharmacological NSAID class of aryl-acetic, in vitro&#xD;
      demonstrated a nearly six-fold greater permeation coefficient than diclofenac.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vivo, nepafenac easily crosses corneal and retinal tissues following topical ocular&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the study is intended in exploring the specific application of NSAID eye&#xD;
      drops (Nepafenac) as a promising novel therapeutic approach for treating children with CHED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no published reports of human trials for the application of NSAID eye drops in&#xD;
      cases of Congenital Hereditary Endothelial Dystrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ascertain the clinical utility of topical ophthalmic NSAIDs in reversing or delaying the&#xD;
      corneal cloudiness in children with CHED&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Area/ Setting: Cornea and Anterior Segment Services, Kallam Anji Reddy campus, L V&#xD;
      Prasad, Eye Institute, Hyderabad&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: 2 Years: 15th December 2020- 15th December 2022&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: Since it is a novel study with no other prior works, population size will be&#xD;
      minimum 30 eyes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Diagnosed cases of Congenital Hereditary Endothelial Dystrophy fulfilling&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Double-blinded, Placebo-controlled, Simple randomized control trial: A Paired&#xD;
      eye study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Method: The data of this study will be compared by using the t-test or Ï‡2 test&#xD;
      depending if the data is parametric or non-parametric in nature&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Targeting SLC4A11 mutation using ophthalmic NSAIDs preparation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test drug is Nepafenac eye drops 0.1%w/v. Given at the dosage of 4 drops to be instilled in&#xD;
      the test eye 1 drop 4 times a day (every 4 hourly).That is at morning, afternoon, evening and&#xD;
      at night. This is to be continued for a 6 months duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control drug is Carboxy-methylcellulose sodium lubricant eye drops 0.5%w/v at the same dosage&#xD;
      as the test eye drop but in the control eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test eye will be chosen by Simple Randomization. For all the cases with an even serial&#xD;
      number, the Right eye will be the test eye and for the odd numbered cases, the Left eye will&#xD;
      be the test eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to ensure blinding of the patient and the investigators, both the drops will be&#xD;
      dispensed in identical bottles and will be relabeled with the letter 'R' and 'L' signifying&#xD;
      which eye the patient will be using them. This will be done in prior with only one member of&#xD;
      the study having the list of the identity of drugs. The same person will also be providing&#xD;
      the appropriately labeled drug for the patients and will not be a part of clinical evaluation&#xD;
      and analysis of the patient's data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To check for the patients' compliance, the patients will be required to get the used bottles&#xD;
      at every visit and new ones will be provided. Since each bottle contains 5 ml of solution&#xD;
      they would last for 25-30 days each, as will be our follow-up schedule for the patients.&#xD;
