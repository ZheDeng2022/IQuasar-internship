  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caudal block is one of the most effective modalities to reduce pain both during and after the&#xD;
      surgery involving areas under the umbilicus. According to previous research,&#xD;
      0.5mg/kg-1.5mg/kg dexamethasone is known to enhance the analgesic quality of caudal block in&#xD;
      children. Despite the fact that this high dose of dexamethasone is used to treat airway edema&#xD;
      in actual practice and no adverse side effect related to dosage has been reported, it is 3 to&#xD;
      15 times higher than the daily antiemetic dose of dexamethasone that is used in standard care&#xD;
      of anesthesia. Therefore, our study aims to assess the effect of the more practical,&#xD;
      antiemetic dose of dexamethasone (0.15mg/kg) as an adjuvant to enhance the quality of caudal&#xD;
      block through a non-inferiority trial.&#xD;

    <description>The child's parent is to be educated prior to the surgery so that when the pain score (FLACC or Wong-Baker Faces Scale) is 4 or above at home, he or she receives an additional acetaminophen. The outcome assessor calls or text messages the parent at 6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after the surgery to assess the need for additional analgesics until 48 hours after the surgery.</description>
