  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, immunotherapy has become one of the important treatments for malignant&#xD;
      tumors. Among them, PD-1 inhibitors have been widely used in clinical practice, and have&#xD;
      shown a significant survival benefits in many patients. However, the incidence of&#xD;
      immune-related adverse reactions (irAEs) of PD-1 inhibitors is relatively high, and severe&#xD;
      cases can even threaten patients's life. At present, irAEs have become a bottleneck and it is&#xD;
      urgent to establish a prevention strategy for the prediction of irAEs. In this study, we&#xD;
      intends to use Sintilimab as the research drug. A prospective cohort study was carried out.&#xD;
      Part of the sample which was used as a training set would be detected for producing a&#xD;
      time-series multi-dimensional data such as differential genes, metabolites and immune&#xD;
      factors. Then gene expression programming (GEP) was used to explore the irAEs recognition&#xD;
      model. Then, based on this recognition model, internal verification ( part of samples from&#xD;
      the center 1 ) and external verification ( part of samples from the center 2 and center 3&#xD;
      samples) are carried out to accurately predict the high-risk population of irAEs and realize&#xD;
      the early-stage warning of Sintilimab induced- irAEs.&#xD;
