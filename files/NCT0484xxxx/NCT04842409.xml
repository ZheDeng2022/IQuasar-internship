    <textblock>
      SAFE-FORWARD is an observational prospective cohort study. Patient population included both&#xD;
      invasive and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) breast cancer receiving ultra-hypofractionated&#xD;
      whole breast irradiation (26 Gy in 5 fractions) after breast conserving surgery, as per&#xD;
      physician choice. Adjuvant endocrine therapy as per local policy is allowed. Main exclusion&#xD;
      criteria are mastectomy with or without breast reconstruction, neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy, and needs for a tumor bed radiation boost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All enrolled patients will be prospectively monitored for 12 months, receiving a complex&#xD;
      cardiological assessment before radiation therapy (RT) start (baseline), and at 2-, 6-, and&#xD;
      12-month after RT end of treatment. Both acute- , defined as adverse events recorded within&#xD;
      the first 90 days since RT start, and early-late toxicity, will be scored according to EORTC&#xD;
      (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer)/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group&#xD;
      (RTOG) and CTCAE (v.5) scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo six-monthly follow-up clinical visits for the first 5 years and annual&#xD;
      follow-up visits thereafter up to 10 year, as per clinical local practice. Breast cosmesis&#xD;
      will be evaluated through the use of BCCT.core tool and assessment of the health-related&#xD;
      quality of life will be performed through the EORTC quality of life questionnaire (QLQ) C30&#xD;
      and BR45 modules questionnaires at baseline, at the end of RT treatment, at 2- and 6-month.&#xD;

      This prospective cohort study aims to assess heart toxicity and safety using a 1-week&#xD;
      radiation schedule regimen of 26 Gy in five daily fractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint was defined as detection of any subclinical impairment in myocardial&#xD;
      function and deformation (decrease â‰¥10%) measured with standard and 3-dimensional (3D)&#xD;
      echocardiography and left ventricular (LV) global longitudinal strain (GLS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac assessment. Medical history, electrocardiogram (EKG), clinical examination with&#xD;
      specific attention to signs of heart failure, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class and&#xD;
      Canadian angina grading scale score were recorded during each visit. Transthoracic&#xD;
      echocardiography was performed with a commercially available system (EPIQ, X5-1 transducer,&#xD;
      Philips Healthcare, Andover, Massachusetts). All measurements were performed and reported&#xD;
      accordingly to the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) and the European Association of&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Imaging (EACVI) recommendations. Each measure was averaged over three cardiac&#xD;
      cycles. Two-dimensional LVEF (2D-LVEF) was measured by Simpson rule, throughout apical 4- and&#xD;
      2-chamber views. LV mass was calculated from LV oriented M-mode tracings using the Devereux&#xD;
      formula, ASE convention, and was indexed to body surface area (BSA). Diastolic function was&#xD;
      evaluated by left atrial volume index, systolic pulmonary pressure, mitral inflow E/A&#xD;
      pattern, E/A ratio, E velocity deceleration time, annular tissue Doppler e', and E/e' ratio.&#xD;
      After optimizing image quality, maximizing frame rate, and minimizing foreshortening, which&#xD;
      are all critical to reduce measurement variability, GLS measurements were made in the three&#xD;
      standard apical views and averaged. LV 4-, 3-, and 2-chamber views were acquired during&#xD;
      breath hold. From apical long-axis view to visualize aortic valve closure, using opening and&#xD;
      closing clicks of the aortic valve the timing of aortic valve opening and closing on&#xD;
      continuous wave (CW) Doppler imaging respect to EKG R wave was measured. Full-volume&#xD;
      six-cycles gated acquisition breath hold images of left ventricle were acquired for Q-lab&#xD;
      analysis to obtain end-diastolic volume, end systolic volume, indexed to BSA (EDVI and ESVI)&#xD;
      and 3D-LVEF. Q-lab version in this study was 10.5. All echocardiography data was stored&#xD;
      including the original Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) images. All&#xD;
      scans were read jointly by two experienced board certified echocardiographers who were&#xD;
      blinded to all clinical characteristics. Systemic arterial pressure was measured&#xD;
      simultaneously with echo measurements, by means of an arm-cuff sphygmomanometer.&#xD;
