      DISRUPT is a Danish nested case-control study that is currently being conducted to explore&#xD;
      the impact of prenatal exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals on testicular cancer risk&#xD;
      (including histological sub-groups) with emphasis on the analysis of exposure mixtures.&#xD;
      Pregnant mothers provided serum and amniotic fluid at recruitment up to 50 years ago. By&#xD;
      registry linkage within highly reliable national population and disease registries cancer&#xD;
      cases and matched controls will be identified. Levels of EDCs including DDT, DDE and other&#xD;
      organochlorine pesticides, PCBs, PBDEs, PFAS, phthalates and triclosan will be quantified in&#xD;
      cases whose sons develop testicular cancer during 40 year follow up and compared to controls.&#xD;

      Objectives and background Hypothesis: The central hypothesis is that testicular cancer has a&#xD;
      fetal origin and that exposure to Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) plays a pivotal role&#xD;
      in the programming of this disease via disruption of the natural in utero estrogen/androgen&#xD;
      balance and dysregulation of the epigenetic control of gene expression within a critical&#xD;
      masculinization time window of testicular differentiation in the developing male fetus from&#xD;
      gestational weeks 8-14. There will be no (new) medical intervention, no new collection of&#xD;
      biological material and no other strain on the mothers or sons who have already submitted the&#xD;
      biological material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The overall objective of this proposal is to provide unique evidence relating&#xD;
      pre-natal EDC exposure to the risk of testicular cancer in male offspring. The project will&#xD;
      focus on exposures taking place in fetal life directly quantified using serum and amniotic&#xD;
      fluid samples collected from mothers while they were pregnant with the young men now aged 21&#xD;
      to 40. Additionally, the investigators will use dried heel blood spots collected from the&#xD;
      newborn sons within 5 days after birth. Only ten studies have investigated environmental risk&#xD;
      factors and testicular cancer. These were small and addressed ongoing adult EDC exposure&#xD;
      (often after diagnosis); not reflecting exposure levels at the critical time window in early&#xD;
      life. This project will focus on exposures taking place in fetal life and hereby for the&#xD;
      first time address the endocrine disruption hypothesis with respect to testicular cancer in a&#xD;
      large epidemiological study. The specific aims are to investigate the risk of testicular&#xD;
      cancer following in-utero exposure to EDCs including DDE&#xD;
      (1,1-bis-(4-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethene) (major metabolite of DDT), perfluorinated alkyl&#xD;
      substances, phthalates, triclosan and cotinine (nicotine metabolite). These compounds are&#xD;
      selected due to ubiquitous environmental occurrence, detection in humans with evidence of&#xD;
      transfer over placenta and their endocrine disruptive properties. Thus, the successful&#xD;
      completion of this study will have an important impact on the epidemiological evidence in&#xD;
      reproductive male health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Although a rare cancer in the general population, testicular cancer is the most&#xD;
      common malignancy in men aged 20-40 years worldwide, representing around 60% of all cancers&#xD;
      diagnosed for men in this age group. The incidence of this cancer has increased several folds&#xD;
      in all industrialized during the 20th century. The reasons for this trend remain largely&#xD;
      unknown and cannot be explained by established risk factors including cryptorchidism,&#xD;
      Caucasian ethnicity or personal/family history of the cancer. Environmental exposures to&#xD;
      chemicals disrupting natural in-utero hormone balance within a critical time of testicular&#xD;
      differentiation in the developing male fetus may play a role and this is supported by the&#xD;
      evolution of the incident rates between first and second-generation migrant populations. In&#xD;
      addition, the large geographical variations in incidence in different European countries and&#xD;
      the possible increase of environmental exposure to endocrine active xenobiotics within the&#xD;
      same period in industrialized countries also support this. Given the peak incidence of this&#xD;
      cancer in young men and the fact that testicular cancer (both seminomas and non-seminomas) is&#xD;
      shown to develop through a common precursor -the carcinoma-in situ cells of fetal origin; the&#xD;
      role of early exposures, during critical time windows of testicular differentiation has also&#xD;
      been hypothesized. This is part of a hypothesis called the testicular dysgenesis syndrome,&#xD;
      proposing a common origin of male reproductive disorders within fetal life resulting from&#xD;
      disturbed programming of the development of male reproductive organs as a result of endocrine&#xD;
      disruption from exogenous compounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Challenges and obstacles The rarity of testicular cancer in the population, the long lag time&#xD;
      between the presumed sensitive period during fetal development and clinical appearance and&#xD;
      the to date lack of appropriate animal models for testicular cancer have hindered the&#xD;
      understanding of the factors involved in the development of this cancer. Therefore, there is&#xD;
      a need for research with reliable data based on exposure assessment quantified in biological&#xD;
      pre-natal samples, which are considered the golden standard for exposure assessment. There is&#xD;
      an evident gap in knowledge regarding evidence to support or refute the role of EDCs in the&#xD;
      fetal origin of testicular cancer. Based on quantification of EDC exposures in biological&#xD;
      samples collected during pregnancy and ascertainment of outcomes in high quality, complete&#xD;
      nationwide Danish registries, this study will provide unprecedented data on risk of&#xD;
      testicular cancer following pre-natal exposure to EDCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unique biobank (already established). All Danish women are offered a free screen for&#xD;
      congenital diseases and chromosomal defects in offspring in the first trimester of their&#xD;
      pregnancy, consisting of an ultrasound scan and amniotic fluid/blood sample. Samples from&#xD;
      128,702 of the screened pregnant women were stored for research purposes in the Danish&#xD;
      National Biobank, in the period from 1976-2004. Within 7 days of birth all live born children&#xD;
      born to these women had heel-blood sampled and stored as dried blood spots at the same Danish&#xD;
      National Biobank. This heel-blood collection is part of the national Danish screening for&#xD;
      congenital diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The unique infrastructure of Danish registries. In Denmark, information on births, deaths,&#xD;
      immigration and emigration, disease incidence, education and social conditions has been&#xD;
      collected in nationwide registries for several decades and high-quality data with complete&#xD;
      coverage of the whole population is available, offering great possibilities for nationwide&#xD;
      epidemiological studies of health effects related to environmental and lifestyle exposures&#xD;
      that are not be feasible in most other countries. In each registry persons are each&#xD;
      identified by a unique number, called a CPR-number. This number has been given to all&#xD;
      residents of Denmark since the establishment of the Danish Civil Registration System (CRS)in&#xD;
      1968 and allows accurate linkage between registries. Using this infrastructure, the&#xD;
      investigators can identify: (i)Study participants by linking mothers that provided blood and&#xD;
      amniotic fluid to their live-born sons that provided heel-blood at birth. Using the mother's&#xD;
      CPR-number that is linked to her samples in the Danish National Biobank at Staten Serum&#xD;
      Institute the investigators can trace the CPR-number of her son in the Danish Medical Birth&#xD;
      Registry (MBR). The MBR contains information on all live-and stillbirths in Denmark since&#xD;
      1973, as well as information on congenital defects including cryptorchidism of the live-born&#xD;
      sons. Further, the MBR contains information on weight, height, age and ethnicity of mother as&#xD;
      well as the age, ethnicity and CPR-number of the father. (ii) All sons that have developed&#xD;
      cancer in later life with accuracy and complete coverage. Using the Danish Cancer Registry&#xD;
      (DCR), which is a population-based registry containing data on the incidence of all cancers&#xD;
      since 1943, known for accuracy and complete coverage, the investigators will identify all&#xD;
      cases of testicular cancer amongst the live-born sons (22 to 45 years old). (iii) Family&#xD;
      history of testicular cancer with accuracy and complete coverage. Using the DCR and the&#xD;
      father's CPR-number the investigators will trace family history of testicular disease, a&#xD;
      known risk factor for testicular cancer in offspring [72]. All other cancers will be&#xD;
      ascertained for the case-controls. Included controls are free of all cancers and cases with&#xD;
      another cancer prior to testicular cancer onset will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected scientific and public health impact of this proposal. The overall scientific&#xD;
      contribution of the proposed project is to provide human data to scientists, enabling them to&#xD;
      corroborate or refute whether fetal exposure to EDCs are associated with increased risk of&#xD;
      testicular cancer in offspring. Currently there is little that pregnant women (and others)&#xD;
      can do to avoid EDC exposures, which most often are &quot;invisible&quot; pollutants in food,&#xD;
      cosmetics, indoor climate, air and water. If the study refutes associations this could ease&#xD;
      concern and if an association is corroborated the evidence could assist governments and&#xD;
      environmental protection agencies in introducing new policies that can protect vulnerable&#xD;
      populations in home settings, schools and workplaces or implement education programs for&#xD;
      pregnant women such that they can take sensible measures to reduce their exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The project will make use of maternal (serum, amniotic fluid) and newborn (dried&#xD;
      heel-blood) samples stored at the Danish National Biobank (cf. biobank). Design (Nested&#xD;
      case-control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three controls are matched to each case. Controls are free of any cancer and matched by&#xD;
      maternal-and paternal-age, calendar month of blood sample, ethnicity and age and address at&#xD;
      time of cancer diagnosis. This information along with family history of testicular cancer,&#xD;
      history of any cancer in case-control population, and other a-priori determined potential&#xD;
      confounding variables will be obtained from nationwide registries Exposure assessment (Fetal&#xD;
      exposure to EDCs). Two sub-contractors will perform all chemical analyses of maternal levels&#xD;
      of selected EDCs in bio-samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolomics profiling. The Metabolomics Research Group at the Danish Center for Neonatal&#xD;
      Screening at Statens Serum Institut will perform the analysis of the dried blood spot&#xD;
      metabolome. A punch of 3.2 mm diameter of the neonatal dried blood spot of each child will be&#xD;
      used for extraction. Using analytical and computational workflows previously introduced and&#xD;
      applied by the group, a wide range of several thousands of endogenous as well as exogenous&#xD;
      metabolites will be measured. Data will be preprocessed, and mass spectral features will be&#xD;
      annotated to chemical structures using computational metabolomic workflows provided through&#xD;
      the community-driven Global Natural Products Social Molecular networking (GNPS) platform. The&#xD;
      resulting metabolite profiles will be used for statistical analysis to identify metabolites&#xD;
      that are differentially expressed across cases and controls using diverse in-house algorithms&#xD;
      in R and python. Outcome ascertainment (testicular cancer). Using the CPR-number the&#xD;
      investigators will link the sons to the DCR to extract data on the first occurrence of&#xD;
      testicular cancer. Controls are cancer and cryptorchidism free. Cases diagnosed with any&#xD;
      cancer prior to testicular cancer will be excluded. The project duration is 60 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Population. The investigators expect 175 testicular cancer cases (both&#xD;
      seminoma and non-seminomas as these have a common fetal precursor) within this population of&#xD;
      sons. Each case will be matched with three controls giving a total population of 700 men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses. Logistic regression models will be used to estimate risk and 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals (CIs) relating compound concentrations with risk of testicular cancer.&#xD;
      Analyses will be done for individual compounds, compound groups where relevant (total PFASs&#xD;
      and total phthalates) and compound mixtures. Data will be analyzed with and without&#xD;
      adjustment for a-priori determined potentially confounding variables including mothers BMI at&#xD;
      time of the son's birth, history of testicular cancer and cotinine serum levels (marker of&#xD;
      smoking) adjusted for gestational sampling week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolomicsprofiling. Overall variation in the metabolome related to testicular cancer will&#xD;
      be assessed using multivariate statistical methods such as principal coordinates analyses and&#xD;
      permutational multivariate analyses of variance (PERMANOVA).&#xD;
