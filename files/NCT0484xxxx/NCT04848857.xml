  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidence from the COLCOT Trial has shown that anti-inflammatory effect of colchicine reduced&#xD;
      the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with recent myocardial infarction. We&#xD;
      hypothesized that this might be due to the improvement of the coronary plaque stability by&#xD;
      colchicine. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is the most precise method to detect plaque&#xD;
      stability in clinical practice. Thus, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of colchicine on improving the stability of coronary plaque in patients with acute&#xD;
      coronary syndrome.&#xD;

      This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. OCT&#xD;
      coronary images analyzed at an independent imaging core laboratory (Department of Cardiology,&#xD;
      Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China) by blinded expert&#xD;
      readers.&#xD;

    <description>colchicine is a potent anti-inflammatory drug which is currently recommended for the treatment of pericarditis and acute gout attacks, but also familial Mediterranean fever and Behçet disease. This drug acts on inflammation through inhibition of microtubule polymerization by binding free tubule dimers. Colchicine blunts monocyte and neutrophil invasion at the site of inflammation and reduces intracellular trafficking and thus the release of cytokine and production of reactive oxygen species and a variety of proteolytic enzymes.</description>
