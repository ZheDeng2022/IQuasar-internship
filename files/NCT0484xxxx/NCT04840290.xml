  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility and evaluate the safety of&#xD;
      delivering chemotherapy, the usual approach to non-small cell lung cancer, in combination&#xD;
      with Sintilimab (PD-1 antibody), followed by adjuvant therapy after surgical resection.&#xD;
      Consolidation therapy is treatment given following the initial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sintilimab is an investigational drug, which has been approved by the NMPA(National Medical&#xD;
      Products Administration,China. https://www.nmpa.gov.cn/) for use in late stage of non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Sintilimab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the surface of&#xD;
      some cells of the immune system and activates them against cancer cells. It is not&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis is that the addition of Sintilimab to neoadjuvant concurrent&#xD;
      chemotherapy, followed by consolidation Sintilimab, will be safe and feasible to deliver to&#xD;
      patients with resectable stage 3A Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study also plans to observe the efficacy of this combination in the overall and&#xD;
      biomarker-positive population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This is an open-label, single arm phase III trial of neoadjuvant chemotherapy +&#xD;
      Sintilimab with concurrent radiation followed by surgical resection and consolidation&#xD;
      Sintilimab in resectable stage 3A (N2+) NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will have biopsy-confirmed T1-3N2M0 (stage IIIA) non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or large cell/NSCLC not otherwise specified),&#xD;
      performance status 0-1, adequate lung function and deemed medically resectable by a thoracic&#xD;
      surgeon, adequate organ function for chemotherapy, and no contraindications to Sintilimab&#xD;
      (i.e. autoimmune disorders or underlying pulmonary fibrosis).&#xD;

    <measure>Pathologic Complete Response Rate（pCR）</measure>

    <measure>Major Pathologic Responses Rate（MPR）</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks after first day of neoadjuvant therapy (day of surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>The major pathologic response to preoperative therapy, defined histopathologically by the presence of less than 5% viable cancer cells in the surgical specimen, is an important prognostic factor for patients with NSCLC. In this study, we will calculate the proportion of patients with Major Pathologic Responses.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Complete Remission Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks after first day of neoadjuvant therapy (day of surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>the proportion of patients with disappearance of all signs of cancer in response to treatment. Also called complete response rate.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival（PFS）</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 69 months after the first disease progression</time_frame>
    <description>Time from beginning of treatment to progression, death, or five years, whichever came first. Progression is defined as Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival（OS）</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 193 months</time_frame>
    <description>The length of time from either the date of diagnosis or the start of treatment for a disease, such as cancer, that patients diagnosed with the disease are still alive. In a clinical trial, measuring the OS is one way to see how well a new treatment works.</description>
