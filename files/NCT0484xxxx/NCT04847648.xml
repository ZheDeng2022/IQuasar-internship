  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the potential benefit of the adjunctive use of an&#xD;
      air-polishing device in the treatment of peri-implantitis as compared to mechanical infection&#xD;
      control alone. Following establishment of adequate patient-performed infection control, 80&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with moderate/severe peri-implantitis at ≥1 implant will be randomized to&#xD;
      one of two groups. Non-surgical and, if required, surgical therapy will be carried out by&#xD;
      experienced operators in three clinical centers and the mechanical instrumentation (control&#xD;
      group) will be supplemented by the use of air-polishing with erythritol powder (AirFlow&#xD;
      Master, EMS, Nyon, Switzerland) in the test group. The primary outcome assessed is &quot;pocket&#xD;
      closure&quot; (ie probing pocket depth ≤5 mm &amp; absence of profuse bleeding on probing) after&#xD;
      non-surgical (6 months) and surgical therapy (18 months). Secondary outcomes include changes&#xD;
      of clinical signs of soft tissue inflammation, adverse events and patient-reported outcome&#xD;
      measures. Outcomes of non-surgical therapy will be evaluated at 3 and 6 months. Sites with&#xD;
      remaining pathology at 6 months will be subjected to surgical therapy, including a new random&#xD;
      allocation to either mechanical instrumentation or air-polishing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The project will be conducted as a two-armed randomized controlled clinical trial of 5-year&#xD;
      duration in three clinical centers. 80 systemically healthy patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      moderate/severe peri-implantitis at ≥1 implant will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon enrolment, all patients will receive instructions in oral hygiene measures until&#xD;
      adequate plaque control has been established (Plaque Index ≤20%). If required,&#xD;
      supraconstructions will be adjusted to facilitate adequate oral hygiene measures. Thereafter,&#xD;
      study participants will be randomized into two groups, stratified for smoking (yes/no) and&#xD;
      number of implants in need of treatment (single/multiple).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will be subjected to professionally administered mechanical infection&#xD;
      control including the use of hand instruments and polishing cups aiming at the removal of all&#xD;
      supra-mucosal soft and hard deposits from the target sites. In the test group the&#xD;
      aforementioned treatment will be supplemented by the use of an air-polishing device (AirFlow&#xD;
      Master, EMS, Nyon, Switzerland) with a specially designed nozzle for sub-mucosal application&#xD;
      (PerioFlow Handpiece, EMS, Nyon, Switzerland). Following local anesthesia, the instrument&#xD;
      will be used sub-mucosally at all aspects (ie mesial, distal, buccal, lingual) of the&#xD;
      affected implant(s) at a power setting reduced to 60% and with a erythritol powder (14&#xD;
      mikrometer, AirFlow Plus Powder, EMS, Nyon, Switzerland). The handpiece will be guided in a&#xD;
      circular motion in a corono-apical direction not in contact with the implant surface.&#xD;
      Instrumentation time will be limited to 5 seconds at each aspect. Implant-supported&#xD;
      supraconstructions will not be removed for the non-surgical treatment. Patients are recalled&#xD;
      two weeks later for assessment of patient-experienced outcomes, professional supramucosal&#xD;
      cleaning and reinforcement of oral hygiene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peri-implant soft tissues will be evaluated at three months. Implant sites with remaining&#xD;
      signs of pathology (PPD ≥6 mm and presence of BOP at ≥3 aspects per implant will be subjected&#xD;
      to re-treatment according to the initial allocation. The clinical evaluation will be repeated&#xD;
      at 6 months. In case of residual signs of pathology, affected sites will be subjected to&#xD;
      surgical therapy of peri-implantitis within the subsequent 4 weeks. Full thickness flaps will&#xD;
      be elevated and inflamed tissues will be removed. Mineralized deposits on the implant&#xD;
      surfaces will be removed with titanium-coated curettes. Following a second randomization,&#xD;
      stratified for smoking, surface decontamination will be performed using gauzes soaked in&#xD;
      saline in the control group. In the test group, this treatment will be supplemented by&#xD;
      air-polishing (AirFlow Handpiece, EMS, Nyon, Switzerland) with erythritol powder (14&#xD;
      mikrometer, AirFlow Plus Powder, EMS, Nyon, Switzerland) at a power setting reduced to 60%&#xD;
      and followed by careful irrigation with saline. Air polishing will be limited to 60 seconds&#xD;
      per implant. No bone recontouring of bony walls is intended. Flaps will be sutured to the&#xD;
      level of the bone and sutures will be removed after 2 weeks. Implant-supported&#xD;
      supraconstructions will be removed for the surgical intervention, if possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance therapy will be provided at 9 and 12 months and based on individual needs during&#xD;
      the subsequent follow-up. A renewed evaluation will be performed at 12 and 18 months.&#xD;
      Long-term assessments will be carried out annually from years 3 to 5. Should any implant site&#xD;
      present with signs of disease progression (increase of PPD &gt;2 mm and additional bone loss &gt;1&#xD;
      mm compared to baseline) at any of the follow-up examinations, the implant will be exited&#xD;
      from the study and appropriate additional therapy will be provided.&#xD;
