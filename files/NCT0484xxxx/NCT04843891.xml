  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety of [64Cu] Macrin and its whole-body distribution, metabolism,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, and radiation burden in healthy volunteers. To detect [64Cu]-Macrin&#xD;
      accumulation in sites of disease in subjects with cancer, sarcoidosis or myocardial infarct.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Macrophages are phagocytic cells of the innate immune system. Their accumulation is a&#xD;
      hallmark of many inflammatory diseases and they have diverse roles in tissue responses to&#xD;
      infection and injury and in tissue repair. As macrophages have a tissue specific and often&#xD;
      disease stage specific roles, future therapies directed at macrophage subtypes at certain&#xD;
      points in the course of a disease may be more efficacious and result in less systemic side&#xD;
      effects, as compared to conventional chemotherapeutics. [64Cu] Macrin is designed to detect&#xD;
      macrophages by PET imaging. As a result, PET imaging can be used to identify inflammatory&#xD;
      &quot;hotspots&quot; and quantitate local macrophage density non-invasively. The investigators studies&#xD;
      in mice showed that [64Cu] Macrin has excellent pharmacological and pharmacokinetic profile&#xD;
      with high target uptake and low retention in background tissues and organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators wish to first evaluate in healthy human subjects the pharmacological and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic profile, and the overall safety of the new radiopharmaceutical [64Cu] Macrin.&#xD;
      The investigators will then establish the concentration of [64Cu] Macrin in patients&#xD;
      following myocardial infarct, in sarcoidosis and in cancer patients. In a subset of patients&#xD;
      where tissue sampling is feasible, we will correlate tracer uptake on imaging to macrophage&#xD;
      density on histopathology or with additional standard of care imaging studies.&#xD;
