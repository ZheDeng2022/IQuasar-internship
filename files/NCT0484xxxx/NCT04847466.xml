  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunotherapy is a powerful tool in the fight against cancer. It uses the body s own immune&#xD;
      system to fight the cancer. Unfortunately, cancer cells can find ways to escape from&#xD;
      destruction by the body s immune system, even when immunotherapy is used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Natural killer (NK) cells are an important part of the body s immune system and can help&#xD;
      fight cancer. In combination with immunotherapy, researchers are using engineered NK cells&#xD;
      that recognize and kill cancer cells trying to escape destruction by the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the effectiveness of irradiated PD-L1 CAR-NK cells, combined with pembrolizumab and&#xD;
      N-803, in people with advanced forms of gastric or head and neck cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 and older with advanced gastric or head and neck cancer who have already had&#xD;
      standard cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. Their symptoms and&#xD;
      ability to do normal activities will be assessed. They will have blood and urine tests. They&#xD;
      will have imaging scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get PD-L1 CAR-NK cells by intravenous (IV) infusion. They will get the&#xD;
      cells once a week for 6 weeks. Then they will get the cells once every 2 weeks. Before each&#xD;
      infusion, an IV catheter will be placed in a large arm vein for infusion of these treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get pembrolizumab by IV every 6 weeks. They will get N-803 under the skin&#xD;
      every 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get the study drugs for up to 2 years. They will have study visits every&#xD;
      1-2 weeks during treatment. They will have a safety visit 28 days after treatment ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After treatment ends, participants will be contacted for follow-up every 2 months for a year.&#xD;
      Then they will be contacted every 6 months. They will have tumor scans every 6-12 weeks until&#xD;
      their cancer gets worse.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Natural killer (NK) cells are an important component of an anti-tumor immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PD-L1 CAR-NK (PD-L1 t-haNKs) is an off the shelf, irradiated human, allogeneic, NK cell&#xD;
           line that is frozen, shipped, thawed and then infused.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PD-L1 CAR-NK cells have been engineered to have 3 adaptive modifications:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Expression of a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting the tumor-associated&#xD;
                antigen PD-L1&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Expression of the high-affinity variant (158V) of the human Fc &gt;= receptor (Fc&#xD;
                &gt;=RIIIa/CD16a)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  An endoplasmic reticulum-retained version of the human interleukin-2 (ERIL-2)&#xD;
                cytokine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To improve the safety profile, PD-L1 CAR-NK cells are irradiated, thus inhibiting&#xD;
           proliferation while maintaining cytotoxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Irradiated PD-L1 CAR-NK cells are highly effective at lysing PD-L1 expressing tumor&#xD;
           cells as well as PD-L1 null tumor cells (via expression of native NK cell receptors).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preliminary clinical data from 10 participants treated with PD-L1 CAR-NK cells&#xD;
           (NCT04050709) suggest PD-L1 CAR-NK are well tolerated at a dose of 2x109 cells&#xD;
           intravenous (IV) twice per week. An additional 8 participants have received irradiated&#xD;
           PD-L1 CAR-NK under single patient INDs. PD-L1 CAR-NK cell treatment combined with PD-1&#xD;
           blockade and cytokine therapy may synergistically activate the T-cell and NK cell arms&#xD;
           of the immune system and enhance anti-tumor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The combination of N-803 + PD-1/PD-L1 interaction blockade has a manageable safety&#xD;
           profile&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine the clinical response rate (CR+PR) with irradiated PD-L1 CAR-NK cells in&#xD;
      combination with N-803 plus pembrolizumab in participants with Head and neck squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma and gastric/GEJ cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gastric/GEJ Cancer Cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants must have metastatic or unresectable locally advanced Gastric/GEJ&#xD;
                cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants must have measurable disease by RECISTv1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants must have completed, had disease progression on, or been ineligible to&#xD;
                receive first-line systemic chemotherapy for advanced/metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants with HER2 positive disease must have received HER2-targeted systemic&#xD;
                therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma Cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants must have metastatic or unresectable locally advanced HNSCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants must have measurable disease by RECISTv1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants must have received or been ineligible to receive first-line systemic&#xD;
                chemotherapy and must have received systemic anti-PD-1 therapy (in the first-line&#xD;
                or subsequent-line setting).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Men or women, Age &gt;= 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is an open-label, single-center, phase II trial using a safety lead-in to assess&#xD;
           the safety and tolerability of irradiated PD-L1 CAR-NK cells in combination with N-803&#xD;
           plus pembrolizumab in participants with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and/or&#xD;
           gastric/GEJ cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The phase II objective of this study is to determine the clinical response rate (CR+PR)&#xD;
           with irradiated PD-L1 CAR-NK cells in combination with N-803 plus pembrolizumab in&#xD;
           participants with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and gastric/GEJ cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohorts 1 and 2 enroll simultaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initially, up to 12 participants from Cohort 1 and/or Cohort 2 will enroll and receive 1&#xD;
           dose of PD-L1 CAR-NK cell monotherapy (week -1) for PK/PD studies before starting the&#xD;
           combined treatment of Pembrolizumab and N-803 one week later (week 0). PD-L1 CAR-NK&#xD;
           cells (2x109) will be given intravenously every week until week 6 and then every two&#xD;
           weeks from 6 weeks onward.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration of pembrolizumab will be at the fixed dose of 400 mg intravenous every 6&#xD;
           weeks starting at week 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration of N-803 will be at 15mcg/kg subcutaneously every 4 weeks starting at&#xD;
           week 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive treatments in cycles (1 week=1 cycle) consisting of 7 (+/- 2)&#xD;
           days with a minimum of 5 days between treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is expected that 1-2 participants per month may be enrolled on this trial; thus, an&#xD;
           accrual of 50 evaluable participants is expected to be completed within 3-4 years. To&#xD;
           allow for a small number of inevaluable participants, the accrual ceiling will be set at&#xD;
           55 participants.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants with a history of grade 3 or higher immune-related adverse events&#xD;
             attributed to pembrolizumab or other anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-CTLA-4 therapy.&#xD;
             This exclusion does not apply to participants with permanent endocrine insufficiencies&#xD;
             (e.g. adrenal insufficiency or hypothyroidism) under satisfactory medical management.&#xD;
             Additionally, participants with grade 2 adverse events attributed to these classes of&#xD;
             agents will be excluded with the exception of rash, transient hyperthyroidism,&#xD;
             transient liver enzyme abnormalities or other transient events that resolved without&#xD;
             steroids or immunomodulatory agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV or HBV infection due to unknown effect of PD-L1 targeting via a CAR or N-803 in&#xD;
             these chronic viral infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,&#xD;
             uncontrolled serious cardiac arrhythmia, clinically significant coagulopathy or&#xD;
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because PD-L1 targeting via a CAR has&#xD;
             unknown potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the&#xD;
&#xD;
        mother with PD-L1 targeting via a CAR and N-803, breastfeeding should be discontinued if&#xD;
        the mother is treated on this study for the duration of study participation and for at&#xD;
        least 4 months after last dose of any study drug.&#xD;
