  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BRCA-DIRECT is a pragmatic, randomised, non-inferiority evaluation that aims to evaluate&#xD;
      whether digital delivery of pre-test information for BRCA-testing in breast cancer patients&#xD;
      is non-inferior to current standard practice of 1:1 delivery from a healthcare professional&#xD;
      as measured by rate of uptake of the genetic testing.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be recruited via breast clinics in two oncology centres. Patients will be&#xD;
      provided with a study pack containing information about the study. If in clinic, the patient&#xD;
      can complete an expression of interest form and a saliva/blood sample will be stored until&#xD;
      consent to the study is received. The consent form and saliva sample can be completed at home&#xD;
      and sent to the study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On receipt of a signed study consent form, the local site will confirm the patient's&#xD;
      eligibility and enter details required for study conduct onto the BRCA-DIRECT databases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 24 hours, the participant will be sent a link to the BRCA-DIRECT study platform&#xD;
      interface. This link enables the participant to progress through the study or withdraw if&#xD;
      they have changed their mind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomised 1:1 to receive either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Telephone consultation with a genetic counsellor (standard of care) The telephone&#xD;
           consultations will be as per standard practice of the qualified genetic counsellor&#xD;
           delivering the pre-test information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Digital delivery of pre-test information via BRCA-DIRECT platform (intervention)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive a link to the digital pre-test information. This will consist of&#xD;
      text covering:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Genetics and cancer risk&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Genetics testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What will happen if your test is positive&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What will happen if your test is negative&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Implications for insurance&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have access to a Genetic Counsellor hotline at all stages of the&#xD;
      process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both arms, if a participant decides to proceed with the genetic test they will sign a&#xD;
      digital 'BRCA-test consent' form, which will be formatted to BSGM (British Society of Genomic&#xD;
      Medicine) standards. All participants will receive a copy of their signed BRCA-test consent&#xD;
      form via secure email/post. The participant will have two days following test-consent to&#xD;
      reverse the decision to proceed with the BRCA-test. Beyond those two days, the test will&#xD;
      proceed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The laboratory testing is a standard UK NHS (National Health Service) genetic test. This is&#xD;
      delivered for both the intervention arm and the standard-of-care arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with a negative (normal) genetic test result will be randomised to receive&#xD;
      results either digitally, or via telephone consultation with the Genetic Counsellor. Any&#xD;
      individuals with a positive result will receive their result by telephone. Following delivery&#xD;
      of results, a results letter and copy of the pathology report will be sent to the participant&#xD;
      and their medical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be invited to complete Quality of Life questionnaires, a knowledge test&#xD;
      and satisfaction survey at various time points throughout the study via the BRCA-DIRECT&#xD;
      platform.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants are initially randomised 1:1 to receive genetic pre-test information either via the BRCA-DIRECT digital platform or a genetic counselling telephone appointment. Once the participants BRCA-gene test result becomes available, they are then randomised sequentially depending on the result of the genetic test. Participants with a negative (normal) result are randomised to receive this information either via the BRCA-DIRECT digital platform or a genetic counselling telephone appointment. Participants with a positive result will not be randomised and instead will always have a genetic counselling telephone appointment.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Participant Quality of Life Questionnaire scores collected before pre-test information and after test results received. The Spielberger state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) consists of two self-administered, 20-item questionnaires, with each item rated on a four-point Likert scale. It assesses anxiety proneness (trait) and the current state of anxiety change (state). The Trait anxiety is measured only once before pre-test information, and the State at each time point. High STAI scores signify greater anxiety.</description>
