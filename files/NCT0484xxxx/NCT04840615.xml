      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mesothelioma is a type of cancer. It originates in cells that line human body cavities. Most&#xD;
      people have advanced disease when they are diagnosed. Researchers want to see if a&#xD;
      combination of drugs can help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find a safe dose of LMB-100 in combination with ipilimumab when LMB-100 is injected into&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 and older with malignant pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma that cannot be&#xD;
      cured with surgery and has not responded to standard first-line treatments for mesothelioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor biopsy or effusion, if needed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imaging scans&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart and lung function tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test, if needed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some screening tests will be repeated during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get LMB-100 on Days 1 and 4 for up to 2 cycles. Each cycle lasts 21 days.&#xD;
      They will stay in the hospital for about 8 days each time they get LMB-100. It will be&#xD;
      injected into their tumor with needles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get ipilimumab through a tube that is put in a vein. It will be given on&#xD;
      Day 2 of the first 2 cycles and Day 1 of the next 2 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed for how well they do daily activities. They will give blood and&#xD;
      tissue samples for research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a safety visit 4 to 6 weeks after the last dose of the study drugs.&#xD;
      Then they will have scans every 6 weeks until their disease gets worse. If their tumor gets&#xD;
      bigger, they will have phone, video, or email follow-ups every 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be on this study for life....&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      LMB-100, and a closely related immunotoxin, SS1P, also targeting mesothelin, given&#xD;
      intravenously, have been studied in Phase 1 clinical studies for mesothelioma and pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LMB-100 given intravenously, results in systemic inflammation in patients, but as a single&#xD;
      agent has limited anti-tumor efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Almost all patients develop neutralizing anti-LMB-100 antibodies after 2 cycles of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-tumoral delivery of LMB-100 has been shown to induce immune cell infiltration in&#xD;
      immune-competent mice, bearing murine malignant mesothelioma tumors. Combination with CTLA-4&#xD;
      blockage eradicates murine tumors by promoting anti-cancer immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ipilimumab is a fully human anti CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody, that is approved for treatment&#xD;
      of melanoma and in combination with nivolumab for many solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that intra-tumoral delivery of anti-mesothelin immunotoxin LMB-100 in&#xD;
      combination with ipilimumab will result in greater anti-tumor efficacy in patients with&#xD;
      mesothelioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the safety and feasibility of intra-tumoral LMB-100 injection plus ipilimumab&#xD;
      infusion in patients with mesothelioma&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of intratumorally administered LMB-100 +&#xD;
      ipilimumab in patients with malignant mesothelioma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histologically confirmed pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma not amenable to potentially&#xD;
      curative surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have locally accessible disease suitable for intra-tumor injection of LMB-100. This includes&#xD;
      superficial or visceral lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects must have received prior immune checkpoint therapy with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors&#xD;
      alone or in combination with anti-CTLA4 blocking antibodies, as well as platinum-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age &gt;= 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate organ and bone marrow function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with clinically significant pericardial effusion are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy within 3 weeks or radiotherapy within 2 weeks prior to start of study therapy is&#xD;
      prohibited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with active CNS metastasis are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with active autoimmune disease for which they have received systemic&#xD;
      immunosuppressive medications during the previous 2 years (excluding daily&#xD;
      glucocorticoid-replacement therapy for conditions such as adrenal or pituitary insufficiency)&#xD;
      are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with active interstitial lung disease, or a history of pneumonitis or interstitial&#xD;
      lung disease for which they had received glucocorticoids are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label, single center phase I dose escalation study of intratumorally&#xD;
      administered LMB-concurrently with ipilimumab in subjects with malignant mesothelioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive intratumorally administered LMB-100, beginning at dose level 1, in&#xD;
      21-day cycles. LMB-100 will be given on days 1 and 4 and ipilimumab 3 mg/kg given on day 2.&#xD;
      Patients will receive 2 cycles of LMB-100 plus ipilimumab, followed by 2 cycles of ipilimumab&#xD;
      alone&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor biopsies will be performed prior to each administration of LMB-100, to evaluate changes&#xD;
      in the tumor immune microenvironment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 12 evaluable subjects will be enrolled.&#xD;

             event that 72 hours have elapsed between the screening pregnancy test and the first&#xD;
             dose of study treatment, another pregnancy test (urine or serum) must be performed and&#xD;
             must be negative in order for subject to start receiving study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the&#xD;
             projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 4 months&#xD;
             after the last dose of trial treatment. Pregnant women are excluded from this study&#xD;
             because LMB-100 + ipilimumab are agents with the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with LMB-100 +&#xD;
             ipilimumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with LMB-100&#xD;
             + ipilimumab. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. HIV positive patients will be excluded due to a theoretical concern that the degree of&#xD;
             immune suppression associated with the treatment may result in progression of HIV&#xD;
             infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Positive for Hepatitis B or C (defined as Hepatitis B surface antigen reactive) or&#xD;
             known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV RNA detected) infection. or active HBV&#xD;

&#xD;
         23. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment&#xD;
             within the past 2 years. Note: Participants with basal cell carcinoma of the skin,&#xD;
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma in situ (e.g. breast carcinoma,&#xD;
             cervical cancer in situ) that have undergone potentially curative therapy are not&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.&#xD;
