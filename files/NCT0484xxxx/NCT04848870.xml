  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is a rare chronic systemic autoimmune disease characterized by&#xD;
      destruction of the exocrine glands, including the salivary glands.The lack of saliva exposes&#xD;
      the patient to dental caries, and dental wear although this has rarely been shown in&#xD;
      Sjögren's patients. Moreover, these patients seem to have more inflammation and gingival&#xD;
      recession, although this has not been clearly identified in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our main objective is to assess the prevalence of dental wear and gingival recession in&#xD;
      patients with Sjögren's syndrome by analyzing of the Basic Erosive Wear Examination (BEWE)&#xD;
      score for erosions, Basic Erosive Wear Abrasion (BEWA) score for attrition and percentage of&#xD;
      sites with periodontal recessions greater than 3 mm in relation to the total number of sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our secondary objectives are to investigate a correlation between the prevalence of dental&#xD;
      and gingival wear, gingival inflammation, Decayed, Missing, and Filled Teeth (DMFT) index and&#xD;
      (1) salivary parameters and (2) oral quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The salivary samples will be kept in a biological collection within the URP2496 for later&#xD;
      analysis (biological collection CB-SJO).&#xD;

      Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is a rare chronic systemic autoimmune disease characterized by&#xD;
      destruction of the exocrine glands, including the salivary glands leading to hyposiala. The&#xD;
      lack of saliva exposes the patient to dental caries, and dental wear although this has rarely&#xD;
      been described in Sjögren's patients. Moreover, these patients seem to have more inflammation&#xD;
      and gingival recession, but not clinical attachment loss, although this has not been clearly&#xD;
      identified in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present research focuses on the characterization of tooth wear and gingival recession&#xD;
      prevalence in patients with Sjögren syndrome. A correlation of this parameters with salivary&#xD;
      parameters (Xerostomia Inventory to assess the dryness, unstimulated salivary rate,&#xD;
      stimulated salivary rate, pH and buffer capacity) will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The salivary samples will be kept in a biological collection within the URP2496 for later&#xD;
      cross-sectional research purposes to identify salivary changes associated with increased risk&#xD;
      of dental wear, dental caries, periodontal wear or periodontal inflammation (biological&#xD;
      collection CB-SJO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a descriptive, prospective, open-label, non-interventional, single-center study with&#xD;
      collection of salivary samples (CB-SJO) from a sample of patients with Sjögren's disease as&#xD;
      part of the patient's routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited in the oral medicine department of the AP-HP Charles Foix hospital&#xD;
      (Ivry/seine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time-line of the research is consistent with the usual patient management in oral&#xD;
      medicine department. As Sjogren is a rare disease, we plan an inclusion period of 36 months.&#xD;
      There is no specific follow-up due to the research.&#xD;
