    <textblock>
      The present study was designed to provide further evidence in this particular research&#xD;
      prospective, and this study hence aimed to clinically evaluate the 5-years adhesion&#xD;
      durability of indirect resin composite inlays luted with three different resin cement&#xD;
      strategies in MOD Class II restorations. The formulated null hypothesis was that there is no&#xD;
      significant difference in the clinical performances of the three different resin cement&#xD;
      strategies for luting indirect resin composite inlays in MOD Class II restorations for&#xD;
      5-years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research question was as follows: Do self-adhesive resin cements in class II restorations&#xD;
      present better clinical performances than conventional etch-and-rinse and self-etch resin&#xD;
      cements according to the USPHS criteria?&#xD;

      Objective: To clinically evaluate the 5 years adhesion durability of indirect resin composite&#xD;
      inlays luted with three different resin cement strategies in MOD Class II restorations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: A randomized clinical trial was conducted following the protocol, 40&#xD;
      patients with three large cavities for each one that indicated for indirect MOD Class II&#xD;
      restorations were enrolled in the current study. Then, 120 indirect resin composite inlay&#xD;
      restorations (SR Nexco) were placed and luted with three different resin cement strategies;&#xD;
      an etch-and-rinse (Variolink N), self-etch (Panavia F2.0) and self-adhesive (RelyX Unicem).&#xD;
      Each resin cement was used for luting 20 inlay restorations. A single operator placed all&#xD;
      restorations according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immediatelly after placement, the&#xD;
      restorations were finished and polished. Clinical evaluation was performed at baseline and at&#xD;
      1, 3 and 5 years intervals after placement by two independent examiners using modified USPHS&#xD;
      criteria. The changes in the USPHS parameters during the 5 years period were analyzed with&#xD;
      Fredman test. The baseline scores were compared with those at the recall visits using&#xD;
      Wilcoxon signed rank test, where the level of significance was set at pË‚0.05.&#xD;
