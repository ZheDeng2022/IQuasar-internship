  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PROM Q study aims to compare patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) in patients&#xD;
      undergoing mastectomy and immediate implant based breast reconstruction (IBR). This is the&#xD;
      commonest form of breast reconstruction and current advances in surgical technology have led&#xD;
      to increasing number of patients having implants placed above the pectoral muscle&#xD;
      (pre-pectoral), rather than below it (sub-pectoral). This has important benefits for patients&#xD;
      including shorter surgery time, quicker recovery, and avoidance of animation deformity&#xD;
      (visible muscle twitching of the reconstructed breast) as the pectoral muscle is not divided&#xD;
      to cover the implant. However, potential disadvantages include rippling effect as the implant&#xD;
      is covered by the skin and subcutaneous tissue only, as well as potentially higher risk of&#xD;
      capsule (scar tissue) formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By utilising a validated questionnaire (BREAST-Q), we will assess for any difference in PROMs&#xD;
      between the two groups of patients. The results will provide valuable information for future&#xD;
      patients when making an informed decision about their reconstruction options. This&#xD;
      questionnaire study will include consecutive patients undergoing mastectomy and immediate IBR&#xD;
      for breast cancer as well as for risk reduction at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust. The&#xD;
      study participants will undergo either pre- or sub-pectoral IBR based on their informed&#xD;
      discussion with the clinical team. This is a non-randomised observational study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who undergo implant based immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) are offered an&#xD;
      option of pre- versus sub-pectoral breast reconstruction. Both approaches are well&#xD;
      established and have proven safety in terms of low rate of complication rates. However, we do&#xD;
      not know if there is a significant difference in patient reported outcome measures (PROMs)&#xD;
      between the two surgical techniques over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to investigate if the difference in the surgical technique for immediate&#xD;
      implant breast reconstruction (pre- versus sub-pectoral) influences patient perceived&#xD;
      outcomes. This is a prospective non-randomised longitudinal cohort study which will aim to&#xD;
      recruit consecutive eligible patients undergoing mastectomy with immediate implant based&#xD;
      reconstruction surgery for early breast cancer or risk reduction using repeated measures and&#xD;
      mixed methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will utilise a well validated patient questionnaire for breast reconstruction&#xD;
      (BREAST-Q; http://qportfolio.org/breast-q/breast-cancer/) and will be carried out at a&#xD;
      teaching hospital breast unit. The specific objectives will be to compare aesthetic outcome,&#xD;
      post-operative pain and functionality as reported by PROMs. The study participants will be&#xD;
      followed up for 12 months. The PROMs data will be collected at baseline, 2 weeks, as well as&#xD;
      at 3 and 12 months post-surgery. Matching data will be collected for each study participant&#xD;
      including the type of surgery performed, patient characteristics, post-operative&#xD;
      complications, and any recommended adjuvant treatment. These data will be correlated with the&#xD;
      matching questionnaire results in order to explore for potential clinical factors which may&#xD;
      influence PROMs.&#xD;

    <description>All study participants will undergo skin sparing mastectomy (with or without nipple preservation) for breast cancer or for risk reduction. Patients will undergo immediate breast reconstruction using an implant or a tissue expander. The device will be placed in pre- or sub-pectoral plane which will be supported by mesh (Tiloop/Surgimend Acellular Dermal Matrix) and/or a dermal flap.</description>
