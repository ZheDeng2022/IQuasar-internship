      Investigator-initiated, prospective, non-randomized, open label, non-interventional&#xD;
      multicenter registry to evaluate current treatment of three major cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      entities in clinical practice using a standardized variable-set of relevant covariates and&#xD;
      outcome measures.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF), coronary artery disease (CAD) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are among the&#xD;
      most relevant cardiovascular diseases contributing to overall morbidity and mortality each&#xD;
      itself and in particular in case of their coexistence. Several new therapies have been&#xD;
      introduced in randomized controlled trials but confirmation data of treatment effects in&#xD;
      real-world cohorts using a standardized methodology is scarce. The International Consortium&#xD;
      for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM) defined standard variable sets for all three diseases&#xD;
      in order to objectively monitor the course of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate current health care utilization and interactions between diseases and treatments&#xD;
      in patients with HF, CAD and AF as well as patient-oriented values study initiator will build&#xD;
      a prospective, observational, multicenter cardiovascular registry using standardized patient&#xD;
      variables and endpoints based on the ICHOM recommendations.&#xD;
