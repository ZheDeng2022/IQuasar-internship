      ABSTRACT Objective: The aim of the study is to determine the effects of animal-assisted&#xD;
      activities on the stress and social anxiety levels of physically disabled children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: The research was carried out in two separate Special Education and Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Centers providing education under the Antalya Provincial Directorate of National Education.&#xD;
      The data of the study were obtained between November 2019-September 2020. The study is a&#xD;
      single blind randomized controlled study designed in a pretest, posttest and follow-up&#xD;
      design. The study was carried out in two different institutions to prevent contamination.&#xD;
      Institutions are determined by an independent lottery method. The sample of the study&#xD;
      consisted of 44 physically disabled children between the ages of 8-11, as the intervention&#xD;
      group (n: 21) and the control group (n: 23). A 45-60 minute structured animal supported&#xD;
      activity program (HayDAP) was applied to the intervention group, once a week for 7 weeks.&#xD;
      Interviews were conducted individually. The data of the study were obtained using Personal&#xD;
      Information Form (KBF), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Social Anxiety Scale for Children.&#xD;
      Follow-up evaluation was made at the end of the 1st month following the completion of the&#xD;
      application. There was no intervention in the control group. The data were analyzed using the&#xD;
      Pearson Ki-Square Test in SPSS 23.0 package program, Fisher's Exact Test if large,&#xD;
      Shapiro-Wilks Test, Box M, Bonferroni and mixed pattern ANOVA tests. A 95% significance level&#xD;
      (or α = 0.05 margin of error) was used to determine the differences in the analyzes.&#xD;
