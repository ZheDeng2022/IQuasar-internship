  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is a skin disorder wherein skin cells multiply faster than normal, making the skin&#xD;
      itchy and look patchy and red. It is caused by an overactive immune system where the body&#xD;
      attacks healthy tissue by mistake. The main objective of this study is to assess maternal,&#xD;
      fetal, and infant outcomes of women who are exposed to risankizumab during pregnancy with&#xD;
      those in an unexposed comparator population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risankizumab is an approved drug for the treatment of Plaque Psoriasis. Approximately 818&#xD;
      female participants with pregnancy will be enrolled (409 participants exposed to risankizumab&#xD;
      and 409 without exposure) at multiple sites across the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will not receive risankizumab as part of this study. Maternal and fetal outcomes&#xD;
      during pregnancy for female participants who received risankizumab or other treatment will be&#xD;
      followed for and up to 1 year after delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
      There may be a higher burden for participants in this study compared to standard of care.&#xD;
      Participants will attend visits determined by HCPs during the study at a hospital or clinic.&#xD;
      The pregnancy outcomes including side effects will be collected during routine clinical care.&#xD;
