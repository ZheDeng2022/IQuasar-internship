  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Management of chronic low back pain (LBP) has contributed to its high socioeconomic burden.&#xD;
      The intervertebral disc accounts for 40% or more cases of chronic LBP. Available treatment&#xD;
      options do not improve the underlying degenerative condition, although they do resolve its&#xD;
      symptoms. This indicates the need for new therapies and/or interventions that actually treat&#xD;
      the underlying causes of discogenic pain. Biological therapies by direct injection of PRP&#xD;
      into the annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus seems an effective and feasible option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exosomes derived from blood may potentially transmit some of the unique stem cell properties&#xD;
      to other stem cells, facilitating stemness maintenance, differentiation, self-renewal, and&#xD;
      repair. We propose to have a controlled, randomized, double-blind clinical trial to compare&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of exosomes in LBP. Informed consent will be obtained from all&#xD;
      subjects prior to study participation. Patients will be randomized into 2 arms with either to&#xD;
      receive PRP with exosomes at the centre of the nucleus pulposus or equal amount of placebo&#xD;
      and will be evaluated by 2 interventional spine and medicine physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures Primary Visual analog scale (VAS), Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire&#xD;
      (RDQ), SF 36 health questionnaire, Functional rating index Secondary: MRI - disc degeneration&#xD;
      grading, T2 quantification, Adverse events any evidence of discitis or discontinuation ,&#xD;
      worsening of pain will be deeply analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring visits will be conducted according to standard monitoring procedures. Differences&#xD;
      in paired samples will be compared using the two-tailed Student's t-test. All routine&#xD;
      monitoring functions will be performed prior to the study termination visit.&#xD;

      Eligibility and patient selection: This active control, randomized, double-blind trial will&#xD;
      be conducted as per guidelines of Helsinki declaration on ethical conduct of human studies.&#xD;
      Participants with a history of chronic LBP who met inclusion and exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      recruited. Participants will be evaluated by 2 interventional spine and medicine physicians.&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be provided with the IRB-approved protocol and informed consent will&#xD;
      be taken prior to study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRP Preparation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sample (60 ml) will be centrifuged at 600×g for 10 min to collect plasma fraction. And&#xD;
      centrifuged at 4000×g for 15 min. Supernatant platelet poor plasma (PPP) will be then&#xD;
      removed, leaving 1 ml PRP. PPP will be passed through one-micron special indigenous designed&#xD;
      flush back filter (Alpha Corpuscle, Delhi, India) so that all the platelets present in PPP&#xD;
      fraction will get trapped in the filter. These trapped platelets will be flushed back with 1&#xD;
      ml of PPP to retrieve most of the platelets. This will be mixed together and then passed&#xD;
      through a WBC filter (Terumo Imuguard, USA) to filter off the leukocytes. The final PRP&#xD;
      concentrate (0.1 ml) will be analysed for total leukocyte &amp; platelet counts. Five samples&#xD;
      will be selected randomly treated with bovine thrombin reconstituted in 10% calcium chloride&#xD;
      will be assessed for growth factors [platelet-derived growth factors (PDGF) and vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factors (VEGF)] by ELISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On an average our PRP sample will have 100 billion platelets and 30x concentrate of blood&#xD;
      platelet in 2ml of final PRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exosomes preparation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty ml of blood in EDTA-coated tubes will be spin at 1,200 g for 10 minutes at 4°C to&#xD;
      separate plasma. Plasma will be filtered with (0.22 μm) filter. Avoid any pelleted material&#xD;
      while transferring the plasma. Discard the pelleted material. This tube has special filter to&#xD;
      concentrate exosomes and other growth promoting proteins. Tube will be centrifuged at 3000 g,&#xD;
      RT, 30 min and exosomes will be collected and then will be concentrated (0.5 ml to 3ml). To&#xD;
      recover exosomes clogged in wall of filter -add 20 ml NS (preferably PBS) into micro&#xD;
      centrifuge tube and rinsed it by centrifugation at 3,500 g. Collect the concentrated soup of&#xD;
      exosomes again which were clogged in filter wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantification of protein content will be done by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) Vesicle suspensions with concentrations between 1×107/ml&#xD;
      and 1×109/ml will be examined using a Nanosight NS300 (NanoSight Ltd., UK) equipped with a&#xD;
      405 nm laser to determine the size and quantity of particles isolated. A video of 60-sec&#xD;
      duration will be taken with a frame rate of 30 frames/sec, and particle movement will be&#xD;
      analyzed using NTA software (version 2.3; NanoSight Ltd.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Western blot analysis The exosome supernatant will be denatured in sample buffer and will be&#xD;
      subjected to western blot analysis. Purified exosomes will be analysed for protein expression&#xD;
      HSP70, flottilin, CD63, TSG101 and calnexin. The proteins were visualized on the Bio-Rad&#xD;
      ChemiDoc XRS Imager system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Berkeley, CA, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation and Arms of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately Three hundred patients will be screened to randomly allocate to treatment or&#xD;
      control groups at a 1:1 ratio, to assign 30 patients into each 4 arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Arm I will be assigned to receive placebo (trigger point injection under C arm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Arm II: to receive PRP with exosomes at the center of the nucleus pulposus (2ml) Test&#xD;
           product(s), dose and mode of administration duration of treatment Patients will be&#xD;
           randomly selected based on computer generated number to receive one undistinguishable&#xD;
           injection of PRP ex or placebo. Following skin disinfection of the back 2 ml from the&#xD;
           total PRPex procured was injected as soon as possible by an fluoroscopy guided lateral&#xD;
           approach. Patients received the placebo in a similar manner but not to disc .it will be&#xD;
           in muscles zone around trigger point .Physician who evaluated the study and patient were&#xD;
           unknown of treatment. Patients were advised to continue with usual exercises, routine&#xD;
           precautions, physiotherapy and back care.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Paracetamol (to a maximum of up to one gram) three times a day, will be allowed to be&#xD;
           used as a rescue drug. No systemic corticosteroid, potential symptom-modifying drug&#xD;
           /procedure will be allowed during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study assessments / Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Visual analog scale (VAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. SF 36 health questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Functional rating index&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. MRI - disc degeneration grading, T2 quantification any evidence of discitis&#xD;
                Patients will be assessed by visual analog scale (VAS), SF 36 health questionnaire,&#xD;
                Functional rating index at baseline and followed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. The&#xD;
                structural efficacy will evaluated by MRI t2 quantification and grading as&#xD;
                described earlier in literature at baseline and at 6 months by two experienced&#xD;
                radiologists. Assessors will be blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The patients will be evaluated for any adverse effects and vital signs once a week&#xD;
                for the first month and then once a month up to 6 months. Blood samples were&#xD;
                collected at the time of entry into the study, at six months, and on a final visit&#xD;
                to examine biological variables as well as liver and kidney functions. Tolerability&#xD;
                was assessed and laboratory-based haematological and biochemical assays were&#xD;
                performed. A possible causal relationship with the treatment arm will also be&#xD;
                assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Discontinuation from treatment with a specific reason will be ascertained. Any&#xD;
                evidence of infection/discitis will be delicately observed. Worsening of pain will&#xD;
                be deeply analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
                STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to investigate the differences between&#xD;
                groups. Differences in paired samples will be compared using the two-tailed&#xD;
                Student's t-test. Correlations between variables will be assessed by Pearson's&#xD;
                correlation. SPSS 20.0 will be used for statistical analyses (SPSS, Inc., Chicago,&#xD;
                IL, USA). P&lt;0.05 will be considered to be statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Identification of the relationship between safety issues/side effects and arousal&#xD;
                level using measurement by rating scales. To test whether the relationship between&#xD;
                safety issues/side effects and arousal level differs between IBRF ACP/MCP vs.&#xD;
                Standard of Care groups, using measurement by rating scales, two analyses will be&#xD;
                conducted. Canonical correlation will be used to determine which side effect (or&#xD;
                combination of side effects) explains variance in the rating scale measurements.&#xD;
                Additionally, cluster analysis will be employed to determine whether side effects&#xD;
                are similarly related to arousal levels and outcomes for patients in the three&#xD;
                treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
                MONITORING PROCEDURES/ADVERSE EVENTS / SAFETY ENDPOINTS Monitoring The monitors&#xD;
                will visit the center during the study in addition to maintaining frequent&#xD;

    <description>magnetic resonance imaging to quantify grading of disc degeneration. *Grades 1, 2, and 3 are based on the signal intensity of the nucleus and inner fibers of anulus. For Grade 4, the margins between the inner and other fibers of the anulus at the posterior margin of the disc are indistinct.&#xD;
For Grade 5, the disc is uniformly hypointense, although there is no loss of disc space height. For Grades, 6, 7, and 8, there is progressive loss of disc space height. These could be broadly classified as mild, moderate, to severe loss of disc space height.&#xD;
