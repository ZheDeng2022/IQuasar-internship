  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the clinical efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine in the&#xD;
      treatment of pneumoconiosis and to provide high-quality evidence for the prevention and&#xD;
      treatment of pneumoconiosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pneumoconiosis refers to a group of occupational lung diseases characterized by diffuse&#xD;
      fibrosis of the lung tissue. It is caused mainly by long-term inhalation and deposition of&#xD;
      mineral dust, with varying levels of pathogenicity, into the lungs during occupational&#xD;
      activities. Currently, there are a lack of effective therpy options for pneumoconiosis.&#xD;
      Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) present a favorable prospect in treating pneumoconiosis.&#xD;
      But the quality of the research was low. This needs to be further investigated by&#xD;
      well-designed RCT to demonstrate the effect of TCM for pneumoconiosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel controlled trial was&#xD;
      designed. Patients with coal worker's pneumoconiosis were randomly divided into treatment&#xD;
      group and control group by central random distribution system. For the treatment group, which&#xD;
      was given symptomatic treatments, patients were additionally given Chinese medicine compound&#xD;
      based on TCM syndrome differentiation. For the control group, which was given symptomatic&#xD;
      treatments, patients were additionally given Chinese medicine compound placebo based on TCM&#xD;
      syndrome differentiation. The intervention course is 52 weeks.The Six-minute Walking Distance&#xD;
      (6MWD) and the Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Assessment Test (CAT) score were taken&#xD;
      as the primary outcomes, while the Modified British Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale&#xD;
      (mMRC) score, Pulmonary function, Clinical symptoms and signs questionnaire, the Hospital&#xD;
      Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) score, and the Short Form 36 Health Survey Questionnaire&#xD;
      (SF-36) score as the secondary outcomes, third-party data management and blind evaluation&#xD;
      were adopted.&#xD;

    <description>The COPD assessment test (CAT) is a self-administered questionnaire that measures health-related quality of life. It is an 8-item questionnaire on a 0-5 point scale with higher values indicating greater impact of COPD. The item response values of CAT are summed to produce a single score that ranges from 0-9 (low impact), 10-20 (medium impact), 21-30 (high impact) and 31-40 (very high impact).</description>

    <description>The modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scale is a 5-point (0-4) scale based on the severity of dyspnoea. &quot;0&quot; means no dyspnea perception, &quot;4&quot; means severe dyspnea perception.</description>

    <description>Assessment will be performed by clinical symptoms and signs questionnaire. The clinical symptoms to be evaluated in this study include cough, expectoration, chest tightness, shortness of breath, wheezing and cyanosis. A score of 0-3 will be given to every symptom or sign with a higher score indicating a worse conditoin.</description>

    <description>The MOS 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) is a participant self-rated questionnaire that is a general measure of perceived health status comprising 36 items, divided into eight areas: functional capacity, physical aspects, pain, health general state, vitality, social aspects, emotional aspects, mental health and one question of comparative evaluation between current health conditions and the health conditions from the previous year. Scores range from 0 to 100 where zero corresponds to the &quot;the worst health state&quot; and 100, to &quot;the best health state&quot;.</description>

    <description>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire. The HADS is a fourteen item scale. Seven of the items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression. The anxiety and depression subscales each range from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating higher anxiety/depression complains. Patients were defined as having anxiety or depression or both if the score was 8 or more in the corresponding subscale.</description>
