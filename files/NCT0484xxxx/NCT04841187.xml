    <textblock>
      PSOBIOTEQ is a national multicentric prospective non interventional study which aims to&#xD;
      constitute a French registry of cutaneous psoriasis patients initiating systemic treatment&#xD;
      (excluding acitretin and phototherapy) for moderate to severe cutaneous psoriasis. The&#xD;
      general objective of PSOBIOTEQ registry is to describe the use, benefits and risks of&#xD;
      conventional, biological, biosimilar and small-molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4&#xD;
      (PDE4) systemic treatments in a real-life setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registry aims to meet many specific objectives and to fulfill ancillary studies. The&#xD;
      PSOBIOTEQ registry concerns a largely similar population and has same objectives than the&#xD;
      PSOBIOTEQ Cohort (NCT01617018). Indeed, data from the PSOBIOTEQ cohort will constitute the&#xD;
      historical part of the registry and the cohort patients will pursue their follow-up in the&#xD;
      registry framework, in order to enrich their follow up with new collected data.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      PSOBIOTEQ is a national multicentric prospective non interventional study which aims to&#xD;
      constitute a French registry of cutaneous psoriasis patients initiating systemic treatment&#xD;
      (excluding acitretin and phototherapy) for moderate to severe cutaneous psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exposure of interest is the exposure to any major systemic treatment (excluding acitretin&#xD;
      and phototherapy) for moderate to severe cutaneous psoriasis and marketed in France at the&#xD;
      time of inclusion of the patient in the registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nature of the systemic treatment as well as its administration modalities are defined by&#xD;
      the investigator according to usual practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dermatology departments participating to the PSOBIOTEQ cohort were solicited for&#xD;
      participation to the PSOBIOTEQ registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PSOBIOTEQ registry will start in 2020 with 28 dermatology departments. The PSOBIOTEQ&#xD;
      cohort started in 2012 and was finalized in 2020. The PSOBIOTEQ registry continues from 2020&#xD;
      till 2025.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion will last 4 years with a follow-up of at least 1 year of the latest patient and&#xD;
      until the end of the research for the other patients with a 6 month periodicity and at least&#xD;
      one visit per year, for the data collection (complying with good clinical practice for these&#xD;
      patients). Each included patient remains followed-up as long as he doesn't object.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data required will be collected and registered in a single database (eCRF). The&#xD;
      statistical analyses planned in the research protocol and those responding to requests for&#xD;
      additional data from the Transparency Committee in the context of the provision of&#xD;
      biomedicines, their biosimilars or other major systemic treatments obtaining Marketing&#xD;
      Authorization in the treatment of cutaneous psoriasis, will be performed by the&#xD;
      pharmaco-epidemiology center (CEPHEPI) under the responsibility of Pr Florence TUBACH of La&#xD;
      Pitié Salpêtrière hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ancillary studies analyses responding to general objectives of the registry dealing with&#xD;
      psoriasis and its course, the terms of use or the benefits and risks of its treatments (for&#xD;
      example in case of identification of safety signals) or new research questions emerging&#xD;
      during the conduct of the study (or after the study), whose realization is validated by the&#xD;
      scientific committee of the registry may be carried out by CEPHEPI or the academic teams&#xD;
      participating in the PSOBIOTEQ registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A calculation of the sample size is not justified for this study as it aims to describe all&#xD;
      the patients initiating systemic treatment for cutaneous psoriasis in the participating&#xD;
      centers. However, based on the rate of inclusion in the PSOBIOTEQ cohort, an inclusion rate&#xD;
      of 500 patients per year can be estimated (therefore 2000 patients to be included in 4&#xD;
      years).&#xD;
