  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the proposed research is to document changes in plasma lipoprotein&#xD;
      fractions, including high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)&#xD;
      particle sizes and functionality, following the ground beef interventions. This specifically&#xD;
      addresses the hypothesis that increasing the amount of fat in ground beef reduces risk&#xD;
      factors for cardiovascular disease. Also, the investigators will measure changes in glucose,&#xD;
      insulin, and triacylglycerols (TAG) following low-fat and high-fat ground beef interventions.&#xD;
      An important aspect of this research is that the investigators will confirm that consumption&#xD;
      of high-fat ground beef will reduce carbohydrate intake and increase insulin sensitivity in&#xD;
      men. Furthermore, the investigators will be able to establish which protein sources are&#xD;
      voluntarily replaced by the low- and high-fat ground beefs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Healthy, non-smoking males will be screened for eligibility, and a minimum of 30 males will&#xD;
      be selected for the study based primarily on plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol&#xD;
      (LDL-C) concentrations but also on plasma TAG concentrations. The men must not be consuming&#xD;
      restrictive diets or cholesterol-lowering medications, and must not have total cholesterol&#xD;
      above 300 mg/dL or below 120 mg/dL. Participants will be requested not to change their&#xD;
      habitual level of physical activity. Plasma TAG should not exceed 220 mg/dL. A two-period,&#xD;
      randomized cross-over design will be used based on previous studies from our laboratory. Each&#xD;
      participant will complete two, 5-week ground beef interventions in a randomly assigned order&#xD;
      with a 4-week washout period between the test periods. The men will consume 5 ground beef&#xD;
      patties per week for 5 weeks for each ground beef type (25 patties for each type). The two&#xD;
      treatments will be low-fat (5% fat) and high-fat (25% fat) ground beef. Participants will be&#xD;
      assigned to one of two groups (n ≥ 15 per group), which will be balanced with regard to LDL-C&#xD;
      concentrations at the initial screening. The groups will be blocked for age and body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 for the subjects selected for the study (immediately before the first dietary&#xD;
      intervention) (about 1 hour):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Registered Dietitian will provide diet instructions, sample menus and cooking&#xD;
      instructions. Participants will receive instructions for completion of the diet records using&#xD;
      the NutriBase software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive the first set of patties. Subjects will complete a 3-day diet&#xD;
      record in NutriBase (which is done at home) before they begin eating the patties.&#xD;
      Instructions will also be provided to subjects regarding schedule of patty consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will complete a 3-day diet record in NutriBase during week 5 of the patty&#xD;
      consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Registered Dietitian or Principal Investigator will contact the study subjects (phone or&#xD;
      email) once weekly to ask if the subjects have any questions about the study or the NutriBase&#xD;
      system, and ensure they are cooking and using the patties as instructed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the initial 5 week intervention, there is a 4 week washout period where subjects will&#xD;
      have no study visits and will eat their regular diet. Subjects will be asked to continue&#xD;
      complete a 3-day diet record in NutriBase during the last week of the washout period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Registered Dietitian or PI will contact the study subjects (phone or email) once weekly&#xD;
      to ask if the subjects have any questions about the study or the NutriBase system, and ensure&#xD;
      the subjects are cooking and using the patties as instructed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source of ground beef. The source of raw materials for production of the 5 and 25% fat&#xD;
      patties will be flank and plate primals from feedlot-fed cattle processed through the&#xD;
      Rosenthal Meat Science and Technology Center, Texas A&amp;M University. Primals will be selected&#xD;
      from grain-fed cattle finished under typical feedlot condition, fed at the Texas A&amp;M&#xD;
      University O.D. Butler Animal Science Teaching and Research Center. Prior to the initiation&#xD;
      of each phase of the ground beef interventions, each participant will receive an unlabeled&#xD;
      box containing 25 frozen, vacuum packaged patties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be trained extensively in the preparation and consumption of the ground&#xD;
      beef patties. The Registered Dietitian is an individual consultant who will provide&#xD;
      professional input regarding cooking methods and diet record keeping to the subjects. The&#xD;
      investigators predict that, under conditions in which energy intake remains constant, the&#xD;
      percent energy from fat consumed by the participants will increase while the percent energy&#xD;
      from carbohydrates will decrease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary guidelines and diet records. All participants will receive instructions from an&#xD;
      Registered Dietitian for the preparation and consumption of the ground beef, including&#xD;
      recipes; the Registered Dietitian also will contact the participants as indicated in the&#xD;
      study visits above. Other than the patty consumption, subjects will be told to eat their&#xD;
      regular diet. Previous studies of the investigators indicated strong compliance to&#xD;
      consumption of the ground beef patties, and indicated no changes to the habitual diets of the&#xD;
      participants other than a reduction in the percent of calories from carbohydrates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the screening visit, participants will be required to visit the Department of Animal&#xD;
      Science for a detailed overview of study, including the goals and anticipated outcomes and&#xD;
      collect the vital measurements and blood to determine eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For visit 1, The study staff will explain the Nutribase software and give detailed&#xD;
      instructions for the diet records. The Registered Dietitian will provide instruction and&#xD;
      suggestions for recipes, and will emphasize the importance of consuming the test ground at&#xD;
      the prescribed intervals. During the course of the two, 5-week test periods, the Registered&#xD;
      Dietitian or PI will contact the participants at weekly intervals to answer any questions&#xD;
      about the completion of the diet records or beef preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete a 3-day diet record during the week before the diet&#xD;
      interventions and during the last week of each intervention to establish nutrient intakes and&#xD;
      encourage compliance. The NutriBase software is relatively simple to use and will allow more&#xD;
      accurate information about dietary intakes. Daily intake of protein, carbohydrates, and fat&#xD;
      will be analyzed using commercial NutriBase software. Diet software used in the previous&#xD;
      studies of the investigators provided information about lean, medium-fat, and high-fat meat&#xD;
      consumption, but did not allow the investigators to determine which meat sources were being&#xD;
      replaced by the test ground beef patties; replacement of customary meat sources (e.g., fish,&#xD;
      pork, or poultry) by the test patties will be documented in the current study. Additionally,&#xD;
      dietary exchanges (meats, breads, fruit, vegetables, etc.) will be analyzed to document the&#xD;
      predicted reduction in carbohydrate intake during the consumption of the test patties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General blood sampling and analyses. On the days of blood sampling, subjects will be asked to&#xD;
      report to the laboratory after an overnight fast (at least 10 hours) restricted to water&#xD;
      only. Blood (10 mL) will be collected after 5 minutes of seated rest via venipuncture from&#xD;
      the antecubital fossa region into serum separator vacutainer tubes using standard, sterile&#xD;
      phlebotomy procedures. Blood samples will be drawn during the screening visit and at visits&#xD;
      2, 3, and 4. A total of approximately 40 mL blood will be drawn from each participant over&#xD;
      approximately 15 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After collection, blood will be allowed to clot at room temperature for 2 hours or chilled at&#xD;
      4°C for serum and plasma separation, respectively, prior to centrifugation in a refrigerated&#xD;
      centrifuge for 20 minutes (2,000 × g). One serum separator vacutainer will be transported the&#xD;
      same day to a commercial, Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified&#xD;
      laboratory for determination of total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, and TAG using standard&#xD;
      clinical chemistry analyses. Aliquots of serum and plasma from additional vacutainers will be&#xD;
      transferred into separate 2-mL freezer vials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lipoprotein particle number determination. Lipoprotein particle mass area under the curve&#xD;
      will be determined with a continuous gradient generated by analytical ultracentrifugation.&#xD;
      This procedure allows for the determination at their specific densities of the total number&#xD;
      of particles of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), LDL, dense LDL-III, dense LDL-V, HDL,&#xD;
      buoyant HDL-2b, and remnant lipoprotein (RLP). The concentrations of LDL-I plus LDL-II can be&#xD;
      calculated by difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses. Because all subjects will be rotated through both ground beef&#xD;
      interventions, the data will be analyzed by a split plot design, with diet as the whole plot&#xD;
      and time (habitual diet vs test diet) as the split plot. Power calculations were conducted to&#xD;
      estimate the required sample size on the basis of data from our previous studies in which&#xD;
      HDL-C was increased 2.8 mg/dL by consumption of 24% fat ground beef compared to habitual&#xD;
      diets. Analyses used the following assumptions: power was set at 0.8, and a was set at 0.05.&#xD;
      It was estimated that a sample size of 16 was sufficient to test the hypothesis that high-fat&#xD;
      ground beef would increase HDL-C concentrations.&#xD;
