      The aim of this prospective multicentre study is to evaluate the influence of individual&#xD;
      clotting factor level while being physically active&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with haemophilia (PwH) repetitive joint bleedings result in a so called&#xD;
      haemophilic arthropathy, which is often associated with chronic pain as well as functional&#xD;
      restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the opportunity of sufficient factor treatment regimes, physical activity is no longer&#xD;
      considered as a risk factor for PwH. In contrast, the large amount of current scientific&#xD;
      evidence demonstrated high benefits of regular exercising for PwH. Meanwhile, physical&#xD;
      activity is integrated as recommendation in the ´Guidelines for the management of&#xD;
      hemophilia´. Nevertheless, the detailed influence of the exact course of the individual&#xD;
      clotting factor level corresponding to the intensity of physical activities in consideration&#xD;
      of possible bleeding events in adult PwH have not been examined to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this prospective multicentre study is to evaluate the influence of individual&#xD;
      clotting factor level while being physically activie. Hereby the focus is on haemophilic&#xD;
      specific parameters such as bleeding events, factor treatment and pain. On the basis of this&#xD;
      study, an individualized clotting factor level should be determined which ensures a minimized&#xD;
      risk of a bleeding event, considering type and intensity of the exercises. In line with these&#xD;
      new findings, further interventional studies could be initiated in order to safely enhance&#xD;
      the degraded physical performance as well as quality of life in PwH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The generated knowledge could be further used in the development of haemophilic specific&#xD;
      recommendations regarding physical activity in consideration of the individual clotting&#xD;
      factor level.&#xD;

    <description>The clinical joint situation will be examined in all PwH and controls by the Haemophilia Joint Health Score, which assesses, e.g., swelling, muscle atrophy, crepitus on motion, axial deformity and range of motion. Higher score points imply an increased deficit in the functional and structural joint status as a sign of more pronounced haemophilic arthropathy, with a maximum possible value of 26 score points for knee and ankle joints and a maximum of 20 score points for elbow joints</description>

Screening of depressive and anxious disorders (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, DASS); General well-being (Marburg Questionnaire on Habitual Well-being, MFHW); Course of disease (extent of previous treatment, physicians consulted for pain, use of medication, pain therapy treatment procedures, operations); Medical and psychological/psychiatric comorbidity</description>

    <measure>Pressure pain thresholds</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pressure pain thresholds will be examined by using a digital algometer device (FPX 25 Compact Digital Algom-eter, Wagner Instruments, Greenwich, CT, USA) with a robe area of 1 cm2. Pressure is increased by a rate of 10 Newton/second. It is a measuring method to analyze the current pain condition. Participants are instructed to report the moment when the stimulus becomes painful for the first time. The maximum pressure is 140 N to avoid tissue damages. The mean value of three measurements will be used as pressure pain thresholds for further statistical analyses. Pressure pain thresholds of knee, ankle, elbow, sternum and forehead (the last two being the reference points) will be examined.</description>

    <description>Questionnaire of subjective physical functioning for patients with hemophilia.The HEP Test-Q consists of 25 items belonging to 4 dimensions 'flexibility', 'strength &amp; coordination', 'endurance' and 'body perception' and a single item that measures changes in physical functioning compared to the previous year. Subscales and total score are transformed to a 0-100 scale, with high scores representing better physical functioning.</description>

    <description>The participants of this study will be monitored for a period of twelve months regarding individual clotting factor level, bleeding episodes as well as type and intensity of physical activity. By doing so, bleeding events, factor consumption as well as the course of the individual factor clotting factor level will be documented via the mobile application &quot;myPKFiT&quot;. This individual factor treatment regime will be compared with the retrospective treatment outcome in the last twelve months before the first study visit.</description>
