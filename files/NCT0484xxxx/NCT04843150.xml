  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common malignant disease in childhood.&#xD;
      Survival rates exceed 90% in children and 75% in adults (aged 18-45 years). During the&#xD;
      induction period Asparaginase is an indispensable part of the multiagent treatment, but is&#xD;
      often associated with hypersensitivity, either with clinical allergy or silent inactivation.&#xD;
      In both cases, Asparaginase is inactivated. It is well known that truncation of Asparaginase&#xD;
      treatment due to inactivation reduces survival. To approach understanding Asparaginase&#xD;
      dynamics and hypersensitivity in ALL patients it is important to examine the pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      of Asparaginase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to identify serological parameters for prediction of&#xD;
      hypersensitivity reaction after the first doses of PEG-Asparaginase given intravenously on&#xD;
      the ALLTogether protocol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asp enzyme activity is measurable in plasma, and trough levels above 100 IU/l secure effect.&#xD;
      Patients, who have their treatment truncated, have inferior outcome. For many years prolonged&#xD;
      Asp treatment for 30 weeks has been part of most protocols worldwide, but a recent Nordic&#xD;
      randomized study showed that less asparaginase (8 doses vs 15 doses intramuscularly (IM))&#xD;
      results in the same disease-free survival and significant less toxicity in the less intensive&#xD;
      treatment arm (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, in the current Western European protocol (ALLTogether) less Asp is now given.&#xD;
      The Nordic Countries participate in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike in the previous Nordic protocol, NOPHO ALL2008, in ALLTogether Asp will be initiated&#xD;
      early during induction (day 4 compared to day 30) and given intravenously (IV) and not IM. In&#xD;
      February 2017 it was approved by the NOPHO Board to do more extensive pharmacokinetic studies&#xD;
      of IM administered PEG-asparaginase, as it has not been shown if IM or IV is preferably in&#xD;
      respect to minimizing the incidence of hypersensitivity. Most study groups in the world use&#xD;
      IV administration, thus NOPHO has a unique chance to illuminate inactivation after IM&#xD;
      administration, also in adult patients. Other groups have not published this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For &gt;50% of the patients in ALLTogether, the induction therapy has been reduced from 4 drugs&#xD;
      to 3 drugs. This emphasizes the importance of optimal treatment from the beginning.&#xD;
      Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) will identify patients without activity in order to change&#xD;
      Asp preparation. Additional sampling close after the first dose of PEG-Asp is expected to&#xD;
      identify these patients earlier, providing an opportunity to optimize their treatment for&#xD;
      better disease-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to identify serological parameters for prediction of&#xD;
      hypersensitivity reaction after the first dose of PEG-Asp given IV on the ALLTogether&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
