  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mescaline (the active substance in Peyote and San Pedro cacti) is a classic and long known&#xD;
      serotonergic psychedelic substance (hallucinogen) that is widely used for recreational,&#xD;
      spiritual, and/or ethno medical purposes. Despite its long history, modern data on the acute&#xD;
      effects of mescaline on human is lacking. Mescaline produces prototypical psychedelic&#xD;
      effects, similar as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin. The serotonin 2A&#xD;
      (5-HT2A) receptor is thought to primarily mediate acute alterations of consciousness induced&#xD;
      by LSD and psilocybin. However, the contributory role of the 5-HT2A receptor in&#xD;
      mescaline-induced alterations of consciousness is unclear. Using 5-HT2A receptor antagonist&#xD;
      ketanserin, the psychedelic experience induced by LSD and psilocybin can be attenuated and&#xD;
      shortened. The present study therefore explores the role the 5-HT2A receptor in&#xD;
      mescaline-induced altered states of consciousness using escalating doses of mescaline and the&#xD;
      5-HT2A receptor blocker ketanserin administered before a high dose of mescaline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The present MDR-study will characterize the subjective effects of different doses&#xD;
      of mescaline using modern psychometric instruments and examine the contribution of the 5-HT2A&#xD;
      receptor in the mescaline-induced alterations of consciousness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6-period cross-over design with six treatment&#xD;
      conditions. 1) Placebo (Pla + Pla), 2) 100 mg mescaline (Pla + 100mg mescaline), 3) 200 mg&#xD;
      mescaline (Pla + 200mg mescaline), 4) 400 mg mescaline (Pla + 400mg mescaline), 5) 800 mg&#xD;
      mescaline (Pla + 800mg mescaline), and 6) 40mg ketanserin and 800mg mescaline (Ket + 800mg&#xD;
      mescaline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: 16 healthy participants aged ≥ 25 and ≤ 65 years (8 female, 8 male)&#xD;

    <description>5 Dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness (5D-ASC) assesses mood, anxiety, derealization, depersonalization, changes in perception, auditory alterations, and reduced vigilance. The questionnaire is consisting of 94 items to be rated on a visual analog scale (horizontal line, 100 mm, marked with &quot;not at all&quot; on the left and &quot;extremely&quot; on the right), with higher values indicating stronger effects. Subjects will mark the scale with vertical lines.</description>

    <description>Visual Analog Scales (VAS) will be repeatedly used to assess subjective alterations in consciousness over time. VAS will be presented as 100 mm long horizontal lines marked with &quot;not at all&quot; on the left and &quot;extremely&quot; on the right. The following VAS will be used: &quot;any drug effect&quot;, &quot;good drug effect&quot;, &quot;bad drug effect&quot;, &quot;stimulated&quot;, &quot;happy&quot;, &quot;anxiety&quot;, &quot;nausea&quot;, &quot;alteration of vision&quot;, &quot;alterations of hearing&quot;, &quot;sounds seem to influence what I see&quot;, &quot;alteration of sense of time&quot;, &quot;the boundaries between myself and my surroundings seem to blur&quot;, &quot;I am having insights into connections that previously puzzled me&quot;, &quot;open&quot;, &quot;talkative&quot;, and &quot;trust&quot;.
