    <measure>Change in rickets at Weeks 40 and 64 as examined by the Radiograph Global Impression of Change (RGI-C) global score</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 40 and 64</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in the severity of rickets and bowing were assessed using a disease specific qualitative RGI-C scoring system. The RGI-C is a 7-point ordinal scale with possible values: +3 = very much better (complete or near complete healing of rickets), +2 = much better (substantial healing of rickets), +1 = minimally better (i.e., minimal healing of rickets), 0 = unchanged, -1 = minimally worse (minimal worsening of rickets), -2 = much worse (moderate worsening of rickets), -3 = very much worse (severe worsening of rickets).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Rickets Severity Score (RSS) total score at Weeks 40 and 64</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 40 and 64</time_frame>
    <description>The RSS system is a 10-point radiographic scoring method that was developed to assess the severity of nutritional rickets in the wrists and knees based on the degree of metaphyseal fraying, cupping, lucency, separation, and the proportion of the growth plate affected. Scores are assigned for the unilateral wrist and knee X-rays deemed by the rater to be the more severe of the bilateral images. The maximum total score on the RSS is 10 points and the minimum score is 0, with a total possible score of 4 points for the wrists and 6 points for the knees (the total score is the sum of the wrist and knee score). Higher scores indicate greater rickets severity.</description>

    <measure>Ten-item Short Form Health Survey for Children (SF-10) physical domain scores to examine health-related Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 24, 40 and 64</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-10 is a brief, 10-item, guardian-completed assessment designed to measure the physical and psychosocial functioning of children. The physical functioning (PHS) domain includes 5 questions that assess limitations in physical activities because of health problems. The PHS domain score was calculated using norm-based scoring so that 50 is the average score and the standard deviation equals 10. Higher scores are associated with better functioning/quality of life; a positive change from Baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

    <measure>Face Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R) scores to examine health-related Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 24, 40 and 64</time_frame>
    <description>The FPS-R is a dimensionless 10 point Likert scale used to assess self-reported pain intensity on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (most pain you can imagine). Greater pain scores are indicative of more severe pain.</description>

    <measure>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) scores to examine health-related Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 24, 40 and 64</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS was developed by the National Institutes of Health and uses domain-specific measures to assess patient well-being (Broderick et al. 2013), (NIH 2015). It uses a T-score metric in which 50 is the mean of a relevant reference population and 10 is the standard deviation (SD) of that population. For the Pain Interference Domain, decreases indicate less pain, for the Physical Function Mobility Domain, increases indicate greater mobility and for the Fatigue Domain, decreases indicate less fatigue.</description>
