  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a placebo-controlled study, conducted at US sites to evaluate the anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      effectiveness of the study drug letermovir in adults with HIV and asymptomatic&#xD;
      cytomegalovirus (CMV) who are on antiretroviral therapy (ART)-mediated suppression.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either letermovir or placebo, once daily,&#xD;
      for 48 weeks, followed by 12 weeks of observation on ART alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, randomized, open-label, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial to evaluate&#xD;
      the anti-inflammatory efficacy of letermovir, administered once daily for 48 weeks in adults&#xD;
      with HIV and asymptomatic CMV, who are on ART-mediated suppression. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 to receive either letermovir or placebo. A futility analysis will be performed&#xD;
      after the first 40 participants, who have started study treatment, reach their 8-week study&#xD;
      visit. Study enrollment will be paused after the 40th participant starts treatment until the&#xD;
      results of the futility analysis have been considered.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or&#xD;
             chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry and&#xD;
             confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than&#xD;
             the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV-1 antigen, plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.&#xD;
             NOTE: the term &quot;licensed&quot; refers to a US FDA-approved kit, which is required for all&#xD;
             IND studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        WHO (World Health Organization) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)&#xD;
        guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must use a test that is&#xD;
        different from the one used for the initial assessment. More information on this criterion&#xD;
        can be found in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently on continuous combination ART (antiretroviral therapy) for ≥48 weeks prior&#xD;
             to study entry. This is defined as continuous ART for the 48-week period prior to&#xD;
             study entry with no ART interruption longer than 7 consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Screening plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;40 copies/mL within 90 days prior to study entry using a&#xD;
             FDA-approved assay with a quantification limit of 40 copies/mL or lower performed by&#xD;
             any US laboratory that has a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)&#xD;
             certification or its equivalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-1 RNA level &lt;40 copies/mL for at least 48 weeks prior to study entry performed by&#xD;
             any US laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent. NOTE: Single&#xD;
             determinations that are between the assay quantification limit and 500 copies/mL&#xD;
             (i.e., &quot;blips&quot;) are allowed as long as the preceding and subsequent determinations are&#xD;
             below the level of quantification. The screening value may serve as the subsequent&#xD;
             undetectable value following a blip.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CD4⁺/CD8⁺ cell count obtained within 90 days prior to study entry at any US laboratory&#xD;
             that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive CMV IgG serology, at any time prior to study entry using a FDA-approved assay&#xD;
             at any US laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent. NOTE: If a prior&#xD;
             positive CMV IgG serology test is confirmed in the medical record, a repeat CMV IgG&#xD;
             test is not required at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The following laboratory values obtained within 90 days prior to study entry by any US&#xD;
             laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin &gt;9.0 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelet count &gt;75,000/mm³&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (SGOT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (SGPT),&#xD;
                  and alkaline phosphatase ≤3 x ULN (upper limit of normal)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin ≤2.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: If an individual is taking atazanavir-containing regimen at the time of&#xD;
                  screening, a total bilirubin of ≤5 x ULN is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) &gt;30 mL/min/1.73m² or creatinine&#xD;

                  located on the DMC website.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For individuals assigned female sex at birth and of reproductive potential, negative&#xD;
             serum or urine pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to study entry by any US clinic or&#xD;
             laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent, or a CLIA Certificate of&#xD;
             Waiver for those performing a point of care (POC)/CLIA-waived test. (Urine test must&#xD;
             have a sensitivity of &lt;25 mlU/mL). NOTE: Persons of female sex assigned at birth and&#xD;
             of reproductive potential are defined as having reached menarche and have not been&#xD;
             post-menopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e. have had menses within the&#xD;
             preceding 24 months), and have not undergone testosterone therapy for gender alignment&#xD;
             or surgical sterilization such as hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, tubal ligation&#xD;
             or salpingectomy. An individual's report is considered acceptable documentation or&#xD;
             reproductive status.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persons of female sex assigned at birth and of reproductive potential that are&#xD;
             participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy must agree to use&#xD;
             contraception throughout the study. At least one of the following must be used&#xD;
             throughout the study:&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Hormone-based contraceptive&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Condoms with or without a spermicide NOTE: Individuals who are not of&#xD;
                  reproductive potential are not required to use contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability and willingness of individual or legal guardian/representative to provide&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Change in the ART regimen within 12 weeks prior to study entry or intended&#xD;
             modification of ART during the study. NOTE: Modifications in the dosage or frequency&#xD;
             (i.e. twice a day [bid] to once a day [qd]) of individual antiretroviral (ARV) drugs&#xD;
             during the 12 weeks prior to study entry are permitted. In addition, the change in&#xD;
             formulation (e.g. from standard formulation to fixed-dose combination) is allowed&#xD;
             within 12 weeks prior to study entry. A within class single drug substitution (e.g.&#xD;
             switch from atazanavir to darunavir, or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate to tenofovir&#xD;
             alafenamide) is allowed within 12 weeks prior to study entry. A switch to any other&#xD;
             nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) from abacavir (or vice versa) is not&#xD;
             permissible. No other changes in ART within the 12 weeks prior to study entry are&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory drug use, with the exception of topical,&#xD;
             inhaled, and intranasal corticosteroids within 90 days prior to study entry. See the&#xD;

             tachycardia). Ventricular tachycardia is also an exclusion criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of cardiomyopathy or congenital heart disease or evidence of advanced&#xD;
             conduction system disease including second degree heart block Mobitz type II, third&#xD;

             performance (if present), including head injury with prolonged (&gt;1 hour) loss of&#xD;
             consciousness, central nervous system infection (e.g. encephalitis), severe learning&#xD;
             disability, psychosis, and/or active drug or alcohol use, or dependence that, in the&#xD;
