  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the Canadian ADHD Practice Guidelines, psychostimulants are the preferred&#xD;
      treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), especially for those that&#xD;
      require urgent care. Specifically, long-acting psychostimulants are considered the&#xD;
      gold-standard pharmacological treatment for ADHD. Using extended-release formulations,&#xD;
      long-acting psychostimulants provide an extended duration of daily symptom relief in addition&#xD;
      to overall reductions in ADHD symptoms that are maintained over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In accordance with these guidelines, clinicians may combine psychostimulants with other&#xD;
      medications when it is considered necessary. For complex cases, psychostimulants alone are&#xD;
      often inadequate for improving the effects of ADHD and are therefore prescribed in&#xD;
      conjunction with other medications. At low doses, antipsychotics have been considered&#xD;
      appropriate adjunctive medications. Studies show that most adult cases with ADHD that were&#xD;
      undiagnosed or untreated in childhood result in the need for adjunctive medication in&#xD;
      adulthood to enhance the effects of the psychostimulant. As a result, it is hypothesized that&#xD;
      adjunct treatment with a low dose of cariprazine, an atypical antipsychotic, will enhance the&#xD;
      effectiveness of standard ADHD treatment with a long-acting psychostimulant in a subset of&#xD;
      the ADHD population that achieved little to no response on psychostimulants alone.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      According to the Canadian ADHD Practice Guidelines, psychostimulants are the preferred&#xD;
      treatment of ADHD, especially for individuals that require urgent care. Specifically,&#xD;
      long-acting psychostimulants are considered the first-line pharmacological treatment for&#xD;
      ADHD. Utilizing sustained-release mechanisms, long-acting psychostimulants provide an&#xD;
      extended duration of daily symptom relief in addition to overall reductions in ADHD symptoms&#xD;
      that are maintained over time. Long-acting psychostimulants minimize several of the&#xD;
      limitations of immediate-release psychostimulants including: peak-trough effects, suboptimal&#xD;
      duration of action, increased diversion potential, and non-adherence due to multiple dosages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In accordance with these guidelines, clinicians may combine psychostimulants with other&#xD;
      medications when it is deemed necessary. For complex cases, psychostimulants alone are often&#xD;
      inadequate for ameliorating the debilitating effects of ADHD and are therefore prescribed in&#xD;
      conjunction with other psychotropic medications targeted at the residual symptoms associated&#xD;
      with ADHD. Antipsychotics have been deemed appropriate as adjunctive medications, especially&#xD;
      for the management of reactive-impulsive behaviours, neurological tics, and/or bipolar&#xD;
      disorder. Studies show that most adult cases with ADHD that were undiagnosed or untreated in&#xD;
      childhood result in the use of adjunctive medication in adulthood to augment the effects of&#xD;
      the psychostimulant. As a result, we propose that adjunct treatment with cariprazine, an&#xD;
      atypical antipsychotic, will augment the efficacy of standard ADHD treatment with a&#xD;
      long-acting psychostimulant in a subset of the population that achieved little to no response&#xD;
      on psychostimulants alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cariprazine is an atypical antipsychotic where the active ingredient is cariprazine&#xD;
      hydrochloride (HCl). It is a dopamine D3/D2 receptor partial agonist, with a higher affinity&#xD;
      for D3 receptors as demonstrated in both in vitro and in vivo studies. It was approved by the&#xD;
      FDA in 2015 for the acute treatment of mania/mixed episodes associated with bipolar I&#xD;
      disorder in adults and for the treatment of schizophrenia. Its use is also being explored in&#xD;
      the treatment of major depressive disorder. Cariprazine capsules are intended for oral&#xD;
      administration and should be stored between 20-25 Â°C. Each hard gelatin capsule contains a&#xD;
      white to off-white powder of cariprazine HCl, which is equivalent to either 1.5, 3, 4.5, or 6&#xD;
      mg of cariprazine base.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall efficacy and tolerability of cariprazine appears to be good despite some adverse&#xD;
      events including akathisia, insomnia, headache, and weight gain. However, most studies&#xD;
      reported that the adverse events were mild to moderate. Prior to discussing the mechanism of&#xD;
      action of cariprazine and its utility in the present study, we first present a concise review&#xD;
      of dopamine transmission and its relevance to ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dopamine (DA) neurons are involved in acquisition and reinforcement learning thought to be&#xD;
      maintained in part through the mesolimbic dopaminergic system, with projections from the&#xD;
      ventral tegmental area (VTA) to regions such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc). The DAergic&#xD;
      neurons in the midbrain are the main source of the neurotransmitter (NT) and mediate a wide&#xD;
      range of brain functions and behavioural processes such as voluntary movement, mood, reward,&#xD;
      addiction, and stress. In addition to the VTA, dopamine neurons expressing D1 and D2&#xD;
      receptors are typically found in the NAc, substantia nigra (SN), striatum, and hippocampus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DA neurons exhibit two activity states that mediate separate aspects of behavior. Phasic&#xD;
      DA release mainly activates D1 receptors, whereas tonic DA release mainly activates the&#xD;
      higher affinity D2 receptors. Phasic activity is thought to facilitate cue-reward acquisition&#xD;
      and acquisition of incentive salience, whereas tonic activity is involved in response&#xD;
      inhibition and behavioural flexibility. D2 receptor stimulation has been shown to act in&#xD;
      opposition to D1 receptors in the regulation of substrates downstream of cyclic adenosine&#xD;
      monophosphate (AMP). Furthermore, D2 receptor function appears to play a critical role in the&#xD;
      maintenance of reward functions via the NAc as suggested by pharmacological studies. Recent&#xD;
      findings also indicate that phasic DA release drives a rapid activation of D2 neurons,&#xD;
      suggesting that some of the behavioural effects of phasic release may be partially mediated&#xD;
      by D2 signaling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been hypothesized that the D1 pathway is involved in promoting reward responses while&#xD;
      the D2 pathway may mediate the opposite response. Phasic DA events are also proposed to&#xD;
      indicate the importance of learned reward-predictive cues that drive motivated behavior.&#xD;
      Moreover, D3 receptors (D3R), a D2-like receptor, are present in high density in the ventral&#xD;
      striatum, which is a cross-section of neural networks involved in processes of reward,&#xD;
      motivation, and decision making, and are thought to be tonically occupied by endogenous DA.&#xD;
      Due to the projections to/from the prefrontal cortex, abnormal activity at these receptors&#xD;
      may be a potential marker for prefrontal deficits, which underlie the comorbidity between&#xD;
      ADHD and depression and often contributes to treatment resistance in a subgroup of the&#xD;
      population. Cariprazine is therefore assumed to act by exerting antagonist-like actions by&#xD;
      inhibiting the binding of the full agonist DA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cariprazine was found to be unique among antipsychotics in its ability to increase&#xD;
      dopaminergic D3R levels in D3R-rich brain regions following chronic treatment. The exact&#xD;
      mechanisms of action underlying cariprazine's effects have not been fully elucidated.&#xD;
      Zimnisky et al. (2013) found that in D3R knockout mice, cariprazine demonstrated&#xD;
      D3R-dependent protective effects on cognitive function. In addition, Duric et al. (2017)&#xD;
      recently reported that cariprazine significantly attenuated chronic unpredictable&#xD;
      stress-induced anhedonia-like behaviour in wild-type mice. This effect was not observed in&#xD;
      D3R knockout mice, suggesting that the activity is dependent upon D3Rs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is significant because alterations in reward circuitry, particularly involving the&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex, have been observed in ADHD. Specifically, neurotransmitter studies have&#xD;
      revealed abnormalities in DA and norepinephrine (NE) signaling in ADHD. DA and NE activity&#xD;
      are associated with many prefrontal cortex functions, including those involved in the&#xD;
      attentional control system, reward acquisition and maintenance and maintenance of hedonic&#xD;
      tone. Of further interest is the relationship of serotonin (5-HT) to DA and NE because 5-HT&#xD;
      is hypothesized to decrease DA and NE activity through 5-HT binding to the 5-HT2a and 5-HT2c&#xD;
      receptors respectively. It appears that at lower doses, cariprazine is considered a DA&#xD;
      receptor partial agonist, which may serve to increase striatal DA activity, thereby improving&#xD;
      aberrant reward system functioning in individuals with ADHD. At higher doses, cariprazine,&#xD;
      like most antipsychotics, functions as a DA receptor antagonist, thereby further reducing DA&#xD;
      activity. In theory, higher doses of cariprazine should not improve ADHD symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DA theory of ADHD states that ADHD results from DA deficits, specifically lowered&#xD;
      activity in the frontal cortex and striatum, and is supported by a variety of pharmacological&#xD;
      and imaging studies. Given the role of this hypothesized deficit in reward maintenance and&#xD;
      specifically in hedonic tone among ADHD patients, adjunctive treatment with low dose&#xD;
      cariprazine, a D2/D3R agonist, may have the ability to elevate DA activity in the frontal&#xD;
      cortex and ventral striatum and help attenuate dysfunction of the reward circuitry in complex&#xD;
      and severe ADHD patients. For the present study, we are particularly interested in the&#xD;
      potential action of adjunctive low dose cariprazine in the treatment of ADHD with or without&#xD;
      comorbidities for individuals who have had inadequate response to psychostimulants alone. The&#xD;
      trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP)&#xD;
      guidelines, and with applicable Health Canada regulatory requirements. Site-specific Standard&#xD;
      Operating Procedures (SOPs) for conducting clinical trials will be followed for the&#xD;
      recruitment of participants, adverse event reporting, and for the collection, management and&#xD;
      analysis of data throughout the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population Participants (N = 15) with a primary diagnosis of ADHD using diagnostic and&#xD;
      statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM)-5 criteria, with or without comorbid secondary&#xD;
      illnesses, who meet all other inclusion/exclusion criteria are eligible for entry into the&#xD;
      study. We have chosen to assign 10 potential patients as the number of desired completers (N&#xD;
      = 10). Given that the dropout rate with dose adjustment is estimated to be approximately 33&#xD;
      percent, we will enroll a total of 15 participants to complete the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be assigned a participant identification number to maintain patient&#xD;
      confidentiality. Binders will be created for each participant using their unique&#xD;
      study-specific participant ID in order to store and maintain source documents according to&#xD;
      the visit number throughout the duration of the study. Physical binders will be stored in a&#xD;
      locked research office at the site. Source documents both related and unrelated to the&#xD;
      current study will also be stored electronically in a PHIPA-compliant electronic medical&#xD;
      record system. All source documents will be de-identified and will be identifiable only to&#xD;
      members of the study personnel through a password-protected document that contains&#xD;
      participant names and their corresponding participant IDs. Participant data will be entered&#xD;
      into the statistical analysis software (SPSS) using the unique participant IDs in order to&#xD;
      maintain patient confidentiality. The study investigator will permit trial-related&#xD;
      monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory inspection(s), providing direct access to&#xD;
      source data and documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Plan To evaluate the efficacy of adjunct cariprazine (1.5 - 3 mg, daily) in the&#xD;
      treatment of ADHD with or without comorbidities, each participant will act as his/her own&#xD;
      control (within-subjects design) and will be evaluated based on pre-treatment and&#xD;
      post-treatment responses on the primary and secondary outcome measures. The research question&#xD;
      is as follows: Does treatment with adjunct cariprazine improve ADHD symptoms in participants&#xD;
      that are on a stable dose of their psychostimulant who have not yet achieved remission? H0&#xD;
      Adjunct treatment with cariprazine does not improve ADHD symptoms. H1 Adjunct treatment with&#xD;
      cariprazine improves symptoms of ADHD in outpatients who are on a stable dose of an existing&#xD;
      psychostimulant and have not yet achieved remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To answer the research question, a within-subjects t-test will be performed to compare&#xD;
      baseline and post-treatment total scores on the primary ADHD measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary analyses will employ a series of within-subjects t-tests to evaluate the&#xD;
      relationship between cognition, energy and motivation, and hedonic tone at baseline compared&#xD;
      to post-treatment of 8 weeks with adjunct cariprazine. There are no plans for interim&#xD;
      analysis at this time. No pharmacokinetic analyses will be undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response or remission on the primary ADHD outcome measure will be assessed, in addition to&#xD;
      statistical analyses testing significance of absolute change in total scores. All parametric&#xD;
      tests will be 2-tailed and performed at a 5 percent alpha level. Descriptive statistics will&#xD;
      be provided by assessments for the total score and changes from baseline in the total score&#xD;
      on all of the measures used. Data based on observed cases and last observation carried&#xD;
      forward will be summarized. Overall, the safety and tolerability of cariprazine in&#xD;
      participants with ADHD will be assessed by changes from baseline in physical examination,&#xD;
      clinical laboratory test results, and vital signs. Safety analyses will be presented by means&#xD;
      of descriptive statistics, frequency tables and graphical presentations as appropriate.&#xD;
