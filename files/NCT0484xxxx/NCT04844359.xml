  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 135 patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis will be enrolled at 5 clinical centers&#xD;
      across the United States. Patients will be followed for 24 months to determine if biomarkers&#xD;
      in the blood can predict disease progression.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is an immunologically mediated form of lung disease, resulting&#xD;
      from inhalation exposure to a large variety of antigens. For unknown reasons, a subgroup of&#xD;
      patients with HP without a known inciting antigen exposure develops chronic disease with&#xD;
      progressive pulmonary fibrosis (the leading cause of death). Accurately identifying patients&#xD;
      at risk of disease progression is necessary for prognosis and therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled subjects will be followed for 24 months and complete 5 visits to one of the study&#xD;
      centers. Blood biomarkers will be collected in addition to other clinical data to determine&#xD;
      if these biomarkers can predict disease progression.&#xD;
