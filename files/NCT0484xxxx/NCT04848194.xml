  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Widely expressed in the sensory nerve endings of the skin, Transient Receptor Potential&#xD;
      Vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) is a receptor that plays an important role in the perception of pain and&#xD;
      pruritus but also in skin inflammation, primarily by inducing the local release of several&#xD;
      neuropeptides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the mechanisms by which TRPV1-sensitizing inflammatory mediators in damaged skin&#xD;
      have received considerable attention, the role of TRPV1 in psoriasis has so far been little&#xD;
      explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, two studies have reported that ablation of sensory nerves expressing TRPV1 reduced&#xD;
      psoriasiform skin inflammation, demonstrating the neuronal contribution to inflammation in&#xD;
      psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the expression of TRPV1 is not limited to neurons alone. TRPV1 is also expressed by&#xD;
      epidermal keratinocytes and skin microvessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For example, in 2018, transcriptomic analysis of psoriatic patient skins (by definition&#xD;
      devoid of neuron nuclei) revealed that TRPV1 expression was increased in the skin of&#xD;
      psoriatic patients suffering from itching (pruritus).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding human keratinocytes, it is recognized that the activation of TRPV1 present on their&#xD;
      surface induces the release of pro-inflammatory factors such as cyclooxygenase-2. In&#xD;
      addition, the investigators have demonstrated that TRPV1 has a pivotal role in the&#xD;
      keratinocyte production of inflammatory mediators, which is mediated by the&#xD;
      protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2). However, the role of vascular TRPV1 in inflammation is&#xD;
      not described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that in addition to neuronal TRPV1, non-neuronal TRPV1&#xD;
      receptors of non-neuronal cells (keratinocytes and endothelial cells) may be involved in the&#xD;
      vicious circle of the inflammatory process characteristic of psoriasis. Putting TRPV1 at the&#xD;
      center of the deregulation of the homeostatic balance including epithelial, neuronal and&#xD;
      vascular inflammation in psoriasis is totally innovative.&#xD;

      Each patient will have a sample taken in the dermatology department:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4 skin biopsies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with psoriasis will be recruited from the dermatology department. There will be no&#xD;
      further visits, so the duration of the study is 1 day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The samples taken will be used to determine the pleiotropic role of TRPV1 in Psoriasis&#xD;
      Inflammation.&#xD;
