  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transthyretin is a protein produced in the liver that transports thyroid hormone and vitamin&#xD;
      A. A single substitution of an amino acid in the structure of TTR can result in a relatively&#xD;
      unstable protein, the breakdown products of which (predominantly monomers) aggregate&#xD;
      abnormally and produce proteinaceous deposits in nerves and the heart. These deposits are&#xD;
      known as amyloid and produce progressive nerve and heart damage. Amyloidosis due to a mutant&#xD;
      TTR is usually an autosomal dominant and hence is a familial condition. Wild-type TTR is also&#xD;
      capable of producing amyloid deposits which predominantly involves the heart (rather than the&#xD;
      nervous system) resulting in a progressive decrease in cardiac function with increasing signs&#xD;
      of heart failure. This study aims to determine whether subcutaneous injection of an antisense&#xD;
      oligonucleotide drug, known as ION-682884, that has been specifically designed to reduce&#xD;
      production of the protein transthyretin by the liver, can slow or stop the progression of TTR&#xD;
      amyloid cardiomyopathy as compared to historical controls, using advanced echocardiography&#xD;
      and cardiac MRI. This study drug will only be administered to patients who have completed a&#xD;
      24-month study of a similar drug, inotersen (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT037028289).The&#xD;
      study also aims to determine the tolerability and safety of this drug when administered over&#xD;
      a 36+-month period to patients with TTR amyloid cardiomyopathy. The study duration is&#xD;
      open-ended and will continue either until this agent is approved by the FDA, or production is&#xD;
      discontinued based on results of ongoing double-blinded studies.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is limited to those patients who have completed 24 months in our single-center&#xD;
      open-label trial of inotersen for amyloid cardiomyopathy (NCT037028289). Patients must have&#xD;
      an estimated glomerular filtration rate of greater than 30 and a platelet count greater than&#xD;
      130,000. They will have either wildtype or mutant transthyretin cardiomyopathy. It is&#xD;
      anticipated that up to 17 patients will be eligible for the study, age 65-85 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the 24 months in the inotersen study, patients will undergo their final&#xD;
      visit and assessment. This will include an echocardiogram, lab work, 6-minute walk test,&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary exercise testing and, in those without a pacemaker, a cardiac MRI. If the lab&#xD;
      work from the end of study confirms eligibility for the new study, patients will be offered&#xD;
      the option of continuing with the TTR-lowering drug, ION-682884. After informed consent the&#xD;
      patient will be supplied with prefilled syringes containing ION-682884 and the first&#xD;
      injection administered. They will return for follow up visits at six weeks, 12 weeks, three&#xD;
      months, and six months thereafter. At each six-monthly visit they will undergo the same&#xD;
      testing as they had in the inotersen study, namely laboratory measurements, 6-minute walk&#xD;
      test, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, echocardiogram and, unless contraindicated, cardiac&#xD;
      MRI. The patients will remain in the study for an open-ended period of time until study&#xD;
      ending criteria occur (reduction in the glomerular filtration rate to less than 30 or&#xD;
      platelet count with a significant fall) or until the drug is FDA-approved or the manufacturer&#xD;
      or principal investigator terminates the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because ION-682884 is an antisense oligonucleotide similar to inotersen and because inotersen&#xD;
      has been associated with thrombocytopenia and worsening renal function, patients will have&#xD;
      weekly lab draws done in their own home for safety monitoring. These bloods will be used to&#xD;
      measure platelet function every week, and renal function every other week. This is currently&#xD;
      mandated by the Food and Drug administration in the double-blinded study of ION-682884 but&#xD;
      the frequency of blood draws may be decreased overtime depending on the interim safety&#xD;
      analysis results from that study and FDA evaluation of that data.&#xD;

        during Screening 3. Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure [BP] &gt; 160 or&#xD;
        diastolic BP &gt; 100 mmHg) 4. Uncontrolled clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia, per&#xD;
        Investigator's assessment (e.g., no pacemaker, although indicated) 5. Severe uncorrected&#xD;

        example, cardiomyopathy due to hypertension, valvular heart disease, or ischemic heart&#xD;
        disease 7. Screening laboratory results as follows, or any other clinically significant&#xD;
        abnormalities in Screening laboratory values that would render a patient unsuitable for&#xD;
        inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase (ALT/AST) &gt; 2.0 × upper limit of&#xD;
             normal (ULN)&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Urine protein creatinine ratio (UPCR) ≥ 750 mg/g. In the event of UPCR above this&#xD;
             threshold ineligibility may be confirmed by a repeat random spot UPCR ≥ 750 mg/g&#xD;

             with urine microscopy showing &gt; 5 red blood cells per high power field and is related&#xD;
             to glomerulopathies. In women, this exclusion criterion must be assessed outside of&#xD;
             menstrual period. If in the opinion of the Investigator the hematuria is not&#xD;
             considered related to glomerulopathies the patient may be considered eligible, pending&#xD;

             bone marrow, or heart biopsy confirming the absence of light chain and the presence of&#xD;
             TTR protein by mass spectrometry or immunoelectron microscopy. For patients with CKD&#xD;

             ratio is 0.26-2.25.&#xD;
&#xD;
             9. Active infection requiring systemic antiviral or antimicrobial therapy that will&#xD;
             not be completed prior to Study Day 1 10. Known history of or positive test for human&#xD;

             malignancy, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, congenital disorders such as&#xD;
             hemophilia A, B, and Von Willebrand disease) 12. If receiving oral anticoagulants&#xD;

             4 weeks prior to the first dose 13. Malignancy within 5 years, except for basal or&#xD;
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, melanoma in situ, prostate carcinoma grade group&#xD;
