      This study aims to analyze outcomes of patients with systemic right ventricle (SRV) implanted&#xD;
      with Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) systems and to compare the impact of CRT in SRV&#xD;
      patients with other congenital heart diseases (CHD).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is henceforth the main cause of death in adult patients with congenital heart&#xD;
      disease (CHD). The number of affected patients is expected to continue to grow exponentially&#xD;
      due to the important increase and aging of this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In symptomatic patients despite optimal pharmacological therapy, Cardiac Resynchronization&#xD;
      Therapy (CRT) offers a well-recognized therapeutic option in dilated and ischemic&#xD;
      cardiomyopathies with severely impaired left ventricle ejection fraction and complete left&#xD;
      bundle branch block. In patients with CHD, the level of evidence is much more limited.&#xD;
      Underlying phenotypes are heterogeneous, including systemic right ventricles (SRVs), isolated&#xD;
      sub-pulmonary right ventricle dysfunctions, single ventricles, and most of patients have a&#xD;
      right bundle branch block. All these specificities question the extrapolation of data&#xD;
      reported in patients with acquired cardiomyopathies. Despite the lack of evidence, CRT&#xD;
      systems have been progressively used in CHD patients, also because alternative options are&#xD;
      poor, mainly represented by cardiac transplantation, but grafts are rare and congenital&#xD;
      patients frequently have contraindications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A positive impact of CRT in CHD has first been suggested in small series where hemodynamic&#xD;
      invasive parameters (e.g. dP/dt max) were improved and QRS narrowed by multisite pacing. A&#xD;
      few subsequent studies then reported an improvement of ventricular functions and&#xD;
      patient-reported functional subjective parameters (mainly NYHA classification). However, the&#xD;
      number of patients included in most studies was limited and heterogeneous forms of CHD were&#xD;
      often pooled when interpreting results. The studies evaluating CRT specifically in patients&#xD;
      with SRV are very rare and demonstrated conflicting results. The largest study to date&#xD;
      assessing specifically CRT in patients with SRV included 20 patients with congenitally&#xD;
      corrected transposition of the great arteries (cc-TGA) and demonstrated an acute improvement&#xD;
      in two-thirds of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although patients with SRV represent one of the main groups of CHD patients currently&#xD;
      implanted with CRT, the paucity of specific data in this population has been highlighted as a&#xD;
      major evidence gap and as a high-impact research question by the American Heart&#xD;
      Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines committee.&#xD;

        (D-TGA) with atrial switch operation (Mustard or Senning surgery) and patients with&#xD;
        congenitally-corrected transposition of the great arteries (cc-TGA) with SRV (excluding&#xD;
        cc-TGA with systemic left ventricle post surgical repair, e.g., arterial switch procedure&#xD;
