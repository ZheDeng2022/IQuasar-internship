  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New-onset supraventricular arrhythmia (NOSVA) is reported in 40 % of patients with septic&#xD;
      shock and is associated with hemodynamic alterations and mortality. The lack of consensus&#xD;
      regarding best practices for the management of NOSVA in this setting has led to major&#xD;
      variations in practice patterns. Observational studies reported three usual strategies: (i)&#xD;
      heart rate control (hereafter rate control) with the use of antiarrhythmic drugs, essentially&#xD;
      based on low dose of amiodarone, (ii) rhythm control with the use of antiarrhythmic drugs,&#xD;
      essentially based on high dose of amiodarone, and electrical cardioversion, and (iii)&#xD;
      modifiable NOSVA risk factors control (hereafter risk control) without using antiarrhythmic&#xD;
      drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk control would minimize adverse events of antiarrhythmic drugs. Rhythm control would&#xD;
      rapidly improve haemodynamics via restoring diastole and decreasing cardiac metabolic demand,&#xD;
      while minimizing exposure to anticoagulation. Rate control, would limit potential adverse&#xD;
      events of high dose of amiodarone and of electrical cardioversion, while controlling&#xD;
      haemodynamics. Therefore, it seems important to compare these three strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is dual: first, that rate control and rhythm control each improve hemodynamics&#xD;
      with in fine a decreased mortality, as compared to a risk control; second, that rhythm&#xD;
      control outperforms rate control in this setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicenter, parallel-group, open-label, randomized controlled superiority trial to&#xD;
      compare the effectiveness and safety of these three strategies (risk control, rate control&#xD;
      and rhythm control) for NOSVA during septic shock.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All consecutive adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit with NOSVA during septic&#xD;
      shock will be included in the presence of inclusion criteria and in the absence of exclusion&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization, performed immediately after the inclusion (Day-1), in 1:1:1 ratio will be&#xD;
      stratified on center. Then the patient will receive the randomized strategy: risk control,&#xD;
      rate control or rhythm control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before inclusion, the informed consent of the next-of-kin will be sought by study&#xD;
      investigator because the patient will be unable to express his/her will. In the case the&#xD;
      next-of-kin are unidentified and/or unreachable, an emergency procedure will be applied.&#xD;
      Patient consent will be sought as soon as their state of health allows it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to clinical guidelines, patients in all groups will receive therapeutic&#xD;
      anticoagulation if NOSVA &gt; 48 hours and in the absence of contraindication. In all groups,&#xD;
      recommendations for the management of septic shock will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After day-7 (or hospital discharge if before J7), NOSVA treatment will be left at the&#xD;
      discretion of attending physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation criteria will be collected at day-2, day-3, day-7 (or at hospital discharge if&#xD;
      before day-7), at the day of ICU discharge and at Day-28. If the patient has been discharged&#xD;
      before Day-28, the vital status may be obtained by phone call at Day-28.&#xD;

    <description>The duration of septic shock is defined as the time (number of days) from randomization to successful weaning of vasopressors&#xD;
The Finkelstein-Schoenfeld method is based on the principle that each patient in the clinical trial is compared with every other patient within each stratum in a pairwise manner. The pairwise comparison proceeds in hierarchical fashion, using all-cause mortality, followed by the duration of septic shock when patients cannot be differentiated on the basis of mortality. This method gives a higher importance to all-cause mortality.</description>
