      This study is designed to determine the safety and efficacy of two calcineurin inhibitor free&#xD;
      treatment groups 1) a belatacept, everolimus and early corticosteroid withdrawal (ECSWD)&#xD;
      immunosuppressive regimen with rabbit antithymocyte globulin induction (rATG) and 2) a&#xD;
      belatacept, mycophenolate, chronic steroid regimen with rATG and compare to historical&#xD;
      controls of tacrolimus-based and belatacept-based regimens in combination with rATG&#xD;
      induction, mycophenolate, and ESWD in renal transplant recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose is to evaluate the effect of 2 regimens (rATG&#xD;
      induction/belatacept/everolimus/ESWD and rATG induction/belatacept/mycophenolate/CS) on the&#xD;
      composite of patient death, graft loss, or eGFR (MDRD) &lt; 45 mL/min/1.73m2 at Month 12&#xD;
      post-transplantation compared to historical controls of the BEST Trial (groups B and C).&#xD;

      The BETTER trial is designed to determine the safety and efficacy of two calcineurin&#xD;
      inhibitor free treatment groups 1) a belatacept, everolimus and early corticosteroid&#xD;
      withdrawal (ESWD) immunosuppressive regimen with rabbit antithymocyte globulin induction&#xD;
      (rATG) and 2) a belatacept, mycophenolate, chronic steroid regimen with rATG and compare to&#xD;
      historical controls of tacrolimus-based and belatacept-based regimens in combination with&#xD;
      rATG induction, mycophenolate, and ESWD in renal transplant recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A belatacept-based immunosuppressive regimen with rATG induction, everolimus and ESWD in&#xD;
           renal transplant recipients will lead to less risk of graft loss, patient death, or eGFR&#xD;
           &lt;45ml/min/1.73m2 at 12 and 24 months as compared to a tacrolimus-based immunosuppressive&#xD;
           regimen with rATG, mycophenolate, and ESWD in renal transplant recipients (historical&#xD;
           control from the BEST Trial-Group C).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A belatacept-based immunosuppressive regimen with rATG induction, everolimus and ESWD in&#xD;
           renal transplant recipients will lead to less risk of graft loss, patient death, or eGFR&#xD;
           &lt;45ml/min/1.73m2 at 12 and 24 months as compared to a belatacept-based immunosuppressive&#xD;
           regimen with rATG and mycophenolate, and ESWD in renal transplant recipients (historical&#xD;
           control from the BEST Trial-Group B).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A belatacept-based immunosuppressive regimen with rATG, mycophenolate and CS in renal&#xD;
           transplant recipients will lead to less risk of graft loss, patient death, or eGFR&#xD;
           &lt;45ml/min/1.73m2 at 12 and 24 months as compared to a tacrolimus-based immunosuppressive&#xD;
           regimen with rATG, mycophenolate, and ESWD in renal transplant recipients (historical&#xD;
           control from the BEST Trial-Group C).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A belatacept-based immunosuppressive regimen with rATG induction, mycophenolate and CS&#xD;
           in renal transplant recipients will lead to less risk of graft loss, patient death, or&#xD;
           eGFR &lt;45ml/min/1.73m2 at 12 and 24 months as compared to a belatacept-based&#xD;
           immunosuppressive regimen with rATG, mycophenolate, and ESWD in renal transplant&#xD;
           recipients (historical control from the BEST Trial-Group B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A controlled, randomized group study is accepted in renal transplantation to evaluate new&#xD;
      immunosuppressive regimens versus the current standard of care. Although the ideal study&#xD;
      would employ a blinded methodology with a simultaneous control group to minimize bias, the&#xD;
      study will not be blinded and evaluates a historical control groups conducted in similar&#xD;
      centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To allow comparison between studies, the primary composite endpoint of death, graft loss, or&#xD;
      eGFR &lt;45ml/min/1.73m2 will be analyzed similarly. The secondary and tertiary endpoints are&#xD;
      the similar as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BETTER study proposes to compare two additional treatment groups of&#xD;
      rATG/belatacept/everolimus/ESWD (Group D) and rATG/belatacept/mycophenolate/CS (Group E) to&#xD;
      the historical control Groups B and C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All immunosuppressive agents are approved by the FDA for the prophylaxis of renal transplant&#xD;
      rejection, and will be dosed and administered consistent with current clinical practice.&#xD;
