  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Natural Language Processing and machine learning are examples of artificial intelligence&#xD;
      tools. This study will check if these tools correctly identify people with Crohn's disease&#xD;
      with complex perianal fistulas from their medical records.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional, retrospective study of participants with CD and CPF in a&#xD;
      clinical practice setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 100 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have a retrospective data collection to select and analyze information from&#xD;
      EMRs processed by an AI based analytics framework that uses machine learning and NLP&#xD;
      methodologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be structured in two sequential phases: Phase 1 (validation process) and Phase&#xD;
      2 (data collection and NLP). All participants will be enrolled in one observational group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Participants with CD&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Spain. The overall duration of the study is&#xD;
      approximately 21 months.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With CD and CPF Accurately Identified With the use of NLP and Medical Language (MEL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Month 21</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants will be measured in terms of accuracy and precision (sensitivity and specificity) of the &quot;algorithm&quot; used to identify participants with CPF associated with CD. Data obtained through the artificial intelligence (AI) technology will be compared with data obtained through traditional electronic data capture (EDC) and source data verification methods.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With CD and CPF Characterized Using NLP and Machine Learning Techniques</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Month 21</time_frame>
    <description>The following information at the moment of CPF diagnosis will be extracted from the electronical medical records (EMRs): age, gender, date of diagnosis of CPF, smoking status, date of diagnosis of CD, luminal disease characteristics (localization, behaviour and activity) at diagnosis, treatments (medical and surgical) established for luminal disease in the study period, treatments (medical and surgical) established for CPF since first occurrence, fistula characteristics at diagnosis: type of fistula (following American Gastroenterological Association [AGA] classification) number of fistula internal and external openings, fistula activity.</description>

    <description>Participants with CD diagnosed with or without CPF will be identified from EMRs through medical language application program interface (API) software. The AI will apply NLP and machine learning to identify and analyse text information in EMRs and thereby, extract medical information. The study will consist of two sequential phases: Phase 1 (validation process) and Phase 2 (data collection and NLP).</description>
