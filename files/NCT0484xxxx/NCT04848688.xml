  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is an extension to the study StrongMoxi NCT04056325 and entails modifications based&#xD;
      on the outcome of NCT04056325 part A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a phase 3, double-blinded and randomized clinical trial conducted in Cambodia.&#xD;
      It aims at providing evidence on efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic measures of 8 mg of&#xD;
      moxidectin compared to 200 μg/kg ivermectin in adults infected with S. stercoralis. The&#xD;
      efficacy of the treatment will be assessed by collecting three stool samples once&#xD;
      per-treatment and once 21-28 days post-treatment. The stool samples will be analyzed by a&#xD;
      quantitative duplicate Baermann assay.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a phase 3 trial and will determine the efficacy and safety of:&#xD;
&#xD;
      8 mg of moxidectin in comparison to the standard treatment dose of ivermectin (200 μg/kg) in&#xD;
      adults infected with S. stercoralis and to measure moxidectin disposition in adults using a&#xD;
      microsampling device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary objective is to demonstrate non-inferiority in terms of cure rate (CR) against S.&#xD;
      stercoralis in adults of an oral 8 mg of moxidectin compared to 200 μg/kg of ivermectin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the trial are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to evaluate the safety and tolerability of moxidectin&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to compare the larval reduction rate (LRR) of the two different treatment groups against&#xD;
           S. stercoralis&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to evaluate the CRs and egg reduction rates (ERRs) of the different treatment drugs and&#xD;
           regimens against soil-transmitted helminths (STH) co-infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to determine the population pharmacokinetics (popPK) of moxidectin administered to S.&#xD;
           stercoralis-infected in adolescents, as well as normal and underweight adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. to investigate potential extended effects on follow-up helminth prevalence at 42-49 and&#xD;
           63-70 days post-treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. to relate socioeconomic characteristics (SES), access to sanitation, water facilities,&#xD;
           hygiene to baseline infection intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. to determine the larval excretion pattern till day 70 in the moxidectin treatment arm,&#xD;
           determined at every second day between day zero and 70 post-treatment in a subset of 50&#xD;
           adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. to determine the origin of the remaining worm burden after treatment to treatment&#xD;
           failure and reinfection based on genetic profiling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three stool samples will be collected at baseline analysed in duplicates by a quantitative&#xD;
      Baermann method for S. stercoralis infection. Co-infection with other Helminths species will&#xD;
      be identified using duplicate Kato-Katz thick smears on two stool samples. The medical&#xD;
      history of the participants will be assessed with a standardized questionnaire, in addition&#xD;
      to a clinical and physical examination carried out by the study physician shortly before the&#xD;
      treatment day. Each participant will be asked to provide a finger-prick blood sample for&#xD;
      haemoglobin measurements at baseline. Enrolled participants will be treated with either 8 mg&#xD;
      of moxidectin or with the standard treatment ivermectin (200 μg/kg). The adults will be&#xD;
      interviewed a) before treatment, 3 and 24 hours as well as 21-28, 42-49 and 63-70 days after&#xD;
      treatment about the occurrence of adverse events. The efficacy of the treatment will be&#xD;
      determined 21-28 days of post-treatment. All stool samples will be examined with quantitative&#xD;
      sixtuplicate Baermann assays and quadruplet Kato-Katz thick smears. At 42-49 and 63-70 days&#xD;
      post-treatment another three stool samples will be collected and quantified for S.&#xD;
      stercoralis larvae using Baermann assay to assess potential long-term benefits of the study&#xD;
      drugs and treatment regimen. Of 50 adults in the moxidectin arm only, additional stool&#xD;
      samples will be collected every second day between treatment and 70 days post treatment to&#xD;
      evaluate larval secretion patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the PK parameters of the study drug, a subsample of 10 willing youngest adults&#xD;
      (aged 18~20 years old) and voluntary 20 adults (aged 18-65) in the moxidectin arm will&#xD;
      further be asked to provide 3 finger pricks of blood per participant. The finger pricks will&#xD;
      be collected within three consecutive days of post-treatment application. Not more than two&#xD;
      finger pricks will be taken on the same day. To all participating households, a brief&#xD;
      questionnaire will be administered assessing information on socioeconomic characteristics&#xD;
      (SES) and access to sanitation, water facilities, and hygiene behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An available case analysis (full analysis set according to the intention to treat principle)&#xD;
      will be performed, including all participants with primary endpoint data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRs will be calculated as the percentage of larvae-positive subjects at baseline who become&#xD;
      larvae-negative after treatment, assessed 21-28 days post-treatment by sextuplicate Baermann.&#xD;
      Uncertainty estimates around the differences among CRs will be assessed using melded&#xD;
      confidence intervals with mid-p correction. The non-inferiority.&#xD;
