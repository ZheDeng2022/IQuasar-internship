    <textblock>
      This phase II clinical trial studies the safety and effect of Gimatecan in patients with&#xD;
      platinum-resistant recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or peritoneal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chemotherapy will be given every four weeks.This study is a single-arm, multi-center&#xD;
      research design.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study had 3 phases: screening phase, treatment phase and follow-up phase. During the&#xD;
      treatment phase, the drug will continue to be administered until the progression of disease,&#xD;
      complete remission , unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
