  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I-II trial is intented to demonstrate tolerability (i.e. absence of severe&#xD;
      non-hematological toxicity) and efficacy of intended intervention with repeated doses of&#xD;
      Voraxaze, in addition to leucovorin (LV), in patients with renal impairment or renal failure&#xD;
      during previous HD-MTX therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive up to 6 cycles of HD-MTX treatment with 14 days between cycles (a&#xD;
      maximum delay of 28 days is permitted in order to allow time for a patient to recover from&#xD;
      the previous cycle).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MTX is used either alone or as part of a combined chemotherapy protocol either in standard or&#xD;
      high doses in the treatment of a range of cancers and other diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation will be performed using three dose levels of MTX:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level 1: 3.0 g/m2 Level 2: 3.5 g/m2 Level 3: 4.0 g/m2 Up to 6 patients will be treated at&#xD;
      each dose level; each will receive a maximum of 6 cycles of treatment. The dose may be&#xD;
      increased in Cycle 3 in individual patients to the next level, if renal function is adequate&#xD;
      (GFR ≥ 40 mL/min, or in the case of decreased GFR, the decrease is &lt;10% compared with the&#xD;
      pre-treatment value), and absence of grade 3 or 4 non-hematological toxicities.&#xD;

    <description>High-dose Methotrexat Infusion: MTX is given at a dose according to the allocated dose level cohort as a 4-hour IV infusion. HD-MTX cycles (up to 6) should be repeated every 14 days, provided that the patient has recovered (i.e., hematopoietic reconstitution) between cycles. A delay of up to 28 days between cycles is permitted in order to allow patients to recover from the preceding dose of MTX. In patients with a decline of the GFR to &lt;40 mL/min, or in the case of decreased GFR, the decrease is &gt;50% compared with the pretreatment value, treatment will be terminated. At the start of Cycle 3 the dose of MTX can be escalated to the next level if MTX has been well-tolerated according to the criteria described under dose escalation. Voraxaze: 2000 Units in patients weighing ≤100kg and at least 20 Units per kg body weight in patients weighing &gt;100kg is given in each HD-MTX cycle as a slow IV injection at 24 hours (+/- 2 hours) after the start of HD-MTX infusion.</description>
