    <textblock>
      This is a case series of adult, male and female subjects with androgenetic alopecia (male&#xD;
      pattern baldness). A topical hemp oil that is rich in varins (THCV and CBDV) and cannabidiol&#xD;
      (CBD) is being used daily for six months to stimulate hair regrowth using Endocannabinoid&#xD;
      System (ECS) receptors that are found on hair follicles.&#xD;

      The study is a case series of adults (males and females) presenting to a &quot;Hair and Scalp&quot;&#xD;
      center in Clearwater, Florida. Subjects diagnosed with androgenetic alopecia (AGA - male&#xD;
      pattern baldness) and who were not currently using minoxidil or finasteride, were offered the&#xD;
      opportunity to receive a topical hemp-oil extract that is high in varins&#xD;
      (tetrahydrocannabivarin, (THCV) cannabidivarin (CBDV)) as well as cannabidiol (CBD). The&#xD;
      topical also contains 3% peppermint oil. The subjects were given the topical free of charge.&#xD;
      Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two doses, 500mg of hemp oil per dispenser or&#xD;
      1000mg per dispenser. Each dispenser lasted approximately one month, so they used either&#xD;
      1.7mg or 3.4 mg of hemp extract per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty subjects withAGA with Norwood-Hamilton Classification score of 3V or higher will be&#xD;
      selected randomly. The predefined endpoints were hair counts obtained in a defined,&#xD;
      representative area of scalp hair loss using a small tattoo to confirm the location of&#xD;
      measuring hair loss. The primary investigator will make a clinical assessment of hair growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects gave their written informed consent for this six-month trial. The study adhered&#xD;
      to the Helsinki guidelines and was institutionally approved. None of the subjects were&#xD;
      currently using minoxidil or finasteride. No other hair loss treatments were used during the&#xD;
      six months of the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects were randomly assigned to using a dropper bottle or spray can with a nozzle to&#xD;
      apply the extract. Subjects are advised to apply a thin layer once each morning to the areas&#xD;
      of baldness. The hemp oil extract with peppermint was independently analyzed The hemp oil was&#xD;
      infused into a lanolin base lotion and natural Emu oil carrier. Each container (dropper&#xD;
      bottle or spray can) contained one ounce of the extract. Each container is expected to last&#xD;
      approximately one month. The subjects were advised that they could use blow dryers,&#xD;
      conditioners, and other hair preparations. The hemp extract was replaced as needed throughout&#xD;
      the six-month trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A hair count of the greatest area of alopecia was carried out before treatment was started&#xD;
      and again after six months of treatment. To facilitate consistent hair count analysis, a&#xD;
      small permanent black tattoo, approximately 1mm in diameter, was applied to each subject's&#xD;
      head at the area of greatest alopecia. The nonvellus hairs within the 1 cm2 cutout were&#xD;
      pulled through the opening with a surgical skin hook and a hair count was taken using a&#xD;
      Bodelin ProScope with 50x magnification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis was done comparing the number of nonvellus hairs in the 1cm2 cutout&#xD;
      before and after six months of treatment.&#xD;
