  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are looking for a new way to treat women who have symptoms by hormonal changes,&#xD;
      like those that happen in women during menopause. These symptoms can include hot flashes,&#xD;
      night sweats, and changes in blood pressure. These symptoms are caused by hormonal changes&#xD;
      occurring during menopausal transition when women may have also changes in their monthly&#xD;
      cycles. The menopausal transition most often begins between ages 45 and 55 and leads to&#xD;
      menopause, a point in time 12 months after a woman's last period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug, elinzanetant, was designed to treat symptoms caused by hormonal changes.&#xD;
      Before a new treatment can be approved for people to take, researchers perform clinical&#xD;
      trials to better understand how this treatment works and to investigate safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the blood levels of elinzanetant when given as 2&#xD;
      capsules of dose A (what is intended for further research and future commercialization) and&#xD;
      also to compare the blood levels when given as 3 capsules of dose B (what was used for&#xD;
      research up to now). Furthermore, researchers want to find out if taking of elinzanetant on&#xD;
      two time points leads to differences in blood levels of elinzanetant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will be performed in healthy women aged 40 to 65 years.&#xD;

This pertains to scope, timepoint and process of data access. As such, Bayer commits to sharing upon request from qualified researchers patient-level clinical trial data, study-level clinical trial data, and protocols from clinical trials in patients for medicines and indications approved in the US and EU as necessary for conducting legitimate research. This applies to data on new medicines and indications that have been approved by the EU and US regulatory agencies on or after January 01, 2014. Interested researchers can use www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com to request access to anonymized patient-level data and supporting documents from clinical studies to conduct research.
