  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the progression of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic there's an increasing number of patients&#xD;
      recovering from COVID19. Some of these patients still experience hypoxemia and therefore are&#xD;
      still in need of a long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT), usually provided as a constant-flow.&#xD;
      However, during a patient's daily activities, oxygenation levels may vary and the same&#xD;
      constant flow may not be suitable for all tasks. Studies in COPD patients suggest that an&#xD;
      automatic oxygen titration, which adjusts the oxygen flow automatically according to a&#xD;
      patient's blood oxygen levels to prevent desaturations, could be beneficial compared to a&#xD;
      constant oxygen titration during exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far there are no studies available that directly compare the automatic oxygen titration&#xD;
      with the patient's prescribed constant oxygen flow in patients with hypoxemia after&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection during activities of daily life. Therefore, the primary outcome of this&#xD;
      study is to investigate the effects of an automatic oxygen titration (O2matic, Denmark) in&#xD;
      comparison to constant oxygen flow rates as prescribed according to guidelines.&#xD;

      Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      After an infection with SARS-CoV-2, some patients still experience hypoxemia even after being&#xD;
      discharged from the hospital. Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) is then used to increase the&#xD;
      patients blood oxygen level and prolong the time spent within the SpO2 target range,&#xD;
      decreasing the probability of severe hypoxemia or at least lowering the time spent in this&#xD;
      severe hypoxemia and all in all enhance the patient's endurance. A prescription for LTOT is&#xD;
      usually given for constant flow rates which might vary during day- and night use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized, controlled cross-over trial. Its aim is to investigate the&#xD;
      effects of an automatic oxygen titration in patients after SARS-CoV-2 infection on the blood&#xD;
      oxygen saturation level during activities of daily life (walking). Secondary, the effects of&#xD;
      using an automatic titration on endurance, pCO2 blood level as well as heart rate and&#xD;
      breathing frequency are compared to using the prescribed constant flow oxygen therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient undergoes a series of shuttle walk tests. After an initial incremental shuttle&#xD;
      walk test (ISWT) to determine the patient's maximum walking speed, the patient undergoes 2&#xD;
      endurance shuttle walk tests (ESWTs) at 85% of the maximum walking speed. One of these ESWTs&#xD;
      is performed with the prescribed constant oxygen flow, the other with the O2matic automatic&#xD;
      oxygen titration in a random order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the shuttle walk tests, patient will perform two stair walking tests, again&#xD;
      one with the prescribed constant oxygen flow, the other with the O2matic automatic oxygen&#xD;
      titration in a random order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, patients will be asked to rate their experienced comfort after each ESWT and to&#xD;
      name their preferred oxygen titration system.&#xD;
