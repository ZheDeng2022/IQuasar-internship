      The purpose of this study is to assess of the Safety and Effects of Stereotactic Ablation&#xD;
      Radiotherapy (SABR) combined with Sintilimab in early inoperable synchronous Multiple Primary&#xD;
      Lung Cancer (sMPLC)&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stereotactic ablation radiotherapy (SABR) was performed sequentially on the primary and&#xD;
      secondary lesions. 50Gy/4F or 70Gy/10F were used according to the specific location of the&#xD;
      tumor. Immunotherapy was started 2 weeks after the end of radiotherapy. Sintilimab : 200 mg&#xD;
      intravenously, Q3W every cycle , given on the D1 of each cycle, and total of 4 cycles.&#xD;
