  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PACAAP study aims to report the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies among HCWs&#xD;
      testing during the massive campaign screening set up in France by French ministry of Health&#xD;
      and national authorities in four hospital of the Alpine region.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In France during the first wave of the pandemic, 30,230 symptomatic healthcare workers had&#xD;
      been reported positive. Yet, the prevalence of the infection in French healthcare workers&#xD;
      remains unknown as it mostly reflect symptomatic infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, the prevalence of infection was reported being higher in male healthcare workers, and&#xD;
      in those having patients' facing roles. However, the impact of the level of exposure to&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2, the use of personal protective equipment and hospital organization to prevent&#xD;
      infection and spread remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study aims to report the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among French healthcare&#xD;
      workers after the first wave of the pandemic. It also aims to explore the impact of the type&#xD;
      of occupations and the level of exposure to the viruses on the seroprevalence of infection.&#xD;
