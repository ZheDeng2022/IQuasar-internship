  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Widespread testing and contact tracing are critical to controlling the COVID-19 epidemic.&#xD;
      Distribution of COVID-19 self-test kits can augment public health contact tracing efforts, as&#xD;
      individuals with COVID-19 can distribute self-testing to close contacts. This approach can&#xD;
      increase case detection by facilitating testing among exposed individuals, and potentially&#xD;
      ameliorate stigma, fear, and medical mistrust associated with COVID-19 among vulnerable&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central hypothesis of this study is that distribution of SARS-CoV-2 self-tests to close&#xD;
      contacts of among individuals with COVID-19 infection can increase case detection compared&#xD;
      with a standard contact referral strategy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Strategies to increase testing among individuals exposed to COVID-19 are needed. One approach&#xD;
      to increase testing and case detection is to distribute home test kits to close contacts of&#xD;
      individuals with COVID-19. This approach decreases logistic barriers to testing, potential&#xD;
      exposures to COVID-19, and reduces potential stigma and fear associated with facility-based&#xD;
      COVID-19 testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a cohort study of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 in the&#xD;
      C-STRAND trial (NCT04797858), in order to determine if distribution of self-test kits to&#xD;
      close contacts of of individuals with COVID-19 can increase case detection compared with a&#xD;
      standard contact referral strategy among. Individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 who were&#xD;
      randomized to the self-test (intervention) arm or received self-test kits will be assigned to&#xD;
      receive additional self-test kits to distribute to close contacts. Individuals diagnosed with&#xD;
      COVID-19 who were randomized to the test referral (control) arm or received test referrals&#xD;
      will be assigned to receive text message referrals to give their close contacts to seek&#xD;
      testing if needed. COVID-19 case detection and test uptake will be measured in both arms.&#xD;
