  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Observational studies report associations between physical activity and survival in some&#xD;
      types of adult cancer. In addition, some exercise-induced molecules such as catecholamines&#xD;
      (e.g., adrenaline) are known to change cancer cell signalling, proliferation and have been&#xD;
      linked to clinical outcomes such as survival. The aim of this study is to analyse changes in&#xD;
      adrenaline concentration with a single high-intensity interval exercise intervention on a&#xD;
      cycle ergometer in children and adolescents during treatment for cancer and to examine the&#xD;
      feasibility of the study concept.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise is generally recommended as an adjunct therapy for adult cancer patients as it&#xD;
      counteracts the adverse effects of cancer and its treatment. According to epidemiological&#xD;
      data, exercise is also associated with a reduced risk of tumour developement and an improval&#xD;
      of survival in some tumours. However, the underlying mechanisms by which exercise affects&#xD;
      tumour cells are poorly understood in adult cancer patients and mostly unknown in children.&#xD;
      Recent studies demonstrate anti-cancer effects of exercise-induced adrenaline through natural&#xD;
      killer cell mobilisation and Hippo signalling. In addition, several exercise-induced&#xD;
      molecules such as catecholamines (e.g., adrenaline) are known to change cancer cell&#xD;
      signalling, proliferation and have been linked to clinical outcomes such as survival. The aim&#xD;
      of this pilot study is the analysation of exercise-induced changes in adrenaline&#xD;
      concentration in childhood cancer patients and to show feasibility of the study concept.&#xD;
      Following recruitment within the first and third cycle of chemotherapy and consent for study&#xD;
      participation, all recruited patients perform a single high-intensity interval exercise&#xD;
      intervention on a cycle ergometer. Intensity of the intervals is examined both subjectively&#xD;
      via a scale for rate of perceived exertion and objectively via changes in lactate&#xD;
      concentration pre- and post-exercise as well as heart rate monitoring. Blood samples are&#xD;
      taken by trained personnel staff and prepared for processing (centrifuged, snap-frozen).&#xD;
      Changes in adrenaline concentration are measured with a commercial ELISA kit. For further&#xD;
      identification of metabolites that change with exercise, a non-biased mass spectrometry&#xD;
      metabolomics analysis will be used.&#xD;

    <description>Study participants perform a single bout of exercise on a cycle ergometer (high-intensity interval exercise intervention) within the first and third cycle of chemotherapy. Following a 2 minute warm-up, the interval protocol comprises 10 intervals à 15 seconds with high intensity and 60 seconds low intensity in-between. Blood samples are taken at t0 pre-exercise (after a 10 minute rest) and at t1 immediately post-exercise via central catheter (Hickman/port).</description>
