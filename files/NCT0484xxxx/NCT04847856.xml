  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes Self-care Education (DSCE) is a formal term used to describe the ongoing process of&#xD;
      facilitating the knowledge, skills, and ability necessary for diabetes self-care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supporting self-care is a crucial aspect of any health service, especially the one that&#xD;
      targeting diabetes. It has shown a positive effect on the clinical, psychological, and&#xD;
      behavioural aspects of diabetics. However, culturally adapted educational services that&#xD;
      recognize the context should be established and used carefully, as most of the social media&#xD;
      and YouTube educational products are not relevant most of the time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic patients who receive no education about their diabetes, are four times as likely to&#xD;
      develop complications as those who do not. Oppositely, those who attending diabetes education&#xD;
      programs are less likely to develop long-term complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The core question of the trial is to find an answer to the question: how the Diabetes&#xD;
      self-care information, education provided by trained health care educator at primary care is&#xD;
      effective in controlling patterns of blood glucose, reducing BMI, and enhancing self-care&#xD;
      behaviour among diabetic patients attending chronic care clinic compared to the control group&#xD;
      receiving routine care for diabetes.&#xD;

      A pragmatic Trial is a modern approach for testing research hypotheses in real life to draw&#xD;
      inspiration from the implemented intervention to inform decision making and change in health&#xD;
      policy at the level of primary health care and the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial outcomes could be used in making new policy that directly contributes to the model&#xD;
      of care, health economics, and population health management program. It is a 12 months&#xD;
      pragmatic randomized trial that will recruit type II diabetic patients attending primary&#xD;
      health care centres in Tabuk city.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon successful completion of the trial, the primary and secondary outcomes of the trial like&#xD;
      reduction in the blood glucose level, Body Mass Index (BMI), waist circumference, HbA1c,&#xD;
      serum cholesterol level, and blood pressure are expected. Besides, the development of new&#xD;
      recommendations for diabetes self-care policy, model of care, and on-the-job training at&#xD;
      primary health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample of 250 participants for the two trial arms with an average cluster sample (m) of&#xD;
      about 35 participants per cluster is calculated using STATA clustersampsi command. This is by&#xD;
      specifying the total number of clusters (k) = 6, the mean for sample1 as (mu1) = 0.6, the&#xD;
      mean for sample2 (mu2) = 0.31, the intra-class correlation coefficient (rho) = 0.01, at the&#xD;
      power beta (0.8), and significant alpha level of (0.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collected baseline data and end-line data will be initially analyzed by carrying out both&#xD;
      univariate and bivariate analyses. The univariate analysis will summarize data as means,&#xD;
      standard deviations while multivariate analysis will yield correlations between the measured&#xD;
      variables. Standard statistical tests such as the Student t-test, ANOVA, and F statistic will&#xD;
      be used to test for the effects of interventions and to facilitate comparisons between&#xD;
      intervention and control groups. Then the data will be further analyzed using multilevel&#xD;
      models/hierarchical linear modelling as it allows adjustment of the effect of an intervention&#xD;
      for (imbalance on) individual-level and cluster-level baseline predictors of outcomes. The&#xD;
      collected data will be analyzed based on the intention to treat evaluate the primary outcomes&#xD;
      among both the intervention and control groups i.e. the participants will remain in the group&#xD;
      to which they were randomized. Linear regression models will be used for comparing the&#xD;
      continuous variables. The BMI as a primary outcome will be analyzed using a linear regression&#xD;
      model to find out the effects of the intervention among the intervention groups as well as&#xD;
      among the control groups. The secondary outcomes include reduction in blood glucose level,&#xD;
      serum cholesterol level, blood pressure, and waist circumference will be analyzed using&#xD;
      linear regression models. Statistical significance will be set at 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing data will be managed by applying appropriate multiple imputation STAT commands. As&#xD;
      the variables are continuous; Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method will manage the missing&#xD;
      data; it is planned to use SOLA software for managing data (available at&#xD;
      http://www.solasmissingdata.com/software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generalizability:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is expected to draw some more convenient findings that match the context in Saudi&#xD;
      Arabia and other gulf regions. Given the great similarities in sociodemographic, and cultural&#xD;
      aspect in addition to the similarities in a health care setting in the whole Kingdom. It is&#xD;
      expected that a successful result could fairly be generalized to other health care settings&#xD;
      in Saudi Arabia and even to other gulf regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected limitation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quality of data collection is expected to be not to the expected level. This is because&#xD;
      the same health provider who will conduct the trial intervention is supposed to carry the&#xD;
      data collection task. After all, the physical environment in the health care setting doesn't&#xD;
      permit bringing additional staff to complete the task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical approval will be obtained from the Institutional Review Board in the Faculty of&#xD;
      medicine at the University of Tabuk and the Research Ethics Committee at the Ministry of&#xD;
      health in Tabuk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent: The investigator will make sure that written informed consent is obtained&#xD;
      from each participant before randomization and before the participant has undergone any study&#xD;
      intervention or data collection procedures. The informed consent will be obtained by the&#xD;
      primary health care physician in a special room at the health centre. The primary health care&#xD;
      physician will provide the information about the trial and as well ensure that the&#xD;
      participant has understood the information. This can be achieved through answering adequately&#xD;
      the questions raised by participants; hence, the participants are encouraged to ask questions&#xD;
      about the trial and will be given adequate time to decide, voluntarily, either to participate&#xD;
      in the trial or not. If a participant needs more to decide, then the primary health care&#xD;
      physician should give another appointment for the participants&#xD;
