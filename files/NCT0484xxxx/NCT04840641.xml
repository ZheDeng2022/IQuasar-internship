  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide there is an increase in antibiotic resistance which may have potential fatal&#xD;
      long-term consequences. This is due to extensive use and sometimes misuse of antibiotics in&#xD;
      the treatment of harmless infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate if treatment with flucloxacillin increases drug&#xD;
      metabolism in healthy volunteers through induction of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, CYP1A4,&#xD;
      CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is based on an in vitro study showing that flucloxacillin activates a receptor&#xD;
      (PXR) responsible for transcription of CYP enzymes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial subjects will ingest flucloxacillin for 31 days and at day 10 and 28 ingest a cocktail&#xD;
      of 6 drugs to determine if the CYP enzymes have been induced. Plasma and urine will be drawn&#xD;
      over 72 hours to determine the concentration of the 6 drugs and their metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change in flucloxacillin concentration will also be measured at day 9 and 27 to establish if&#xD;
      flucloxacillin induces its own metabolism.&#xD;
