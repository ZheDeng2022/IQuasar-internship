    <textblock>
      Delirium in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) is a serious problem that has recently&#xD;
      attracted much attention. This study will evaluate the use of electroencephalogram (EEG) for&#xD;
      delirium screening in the PICU.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary objective: In a prospective cohort of children hospitalized in a PICU, EEG features&#xD;
      associated with pediatric delirium (via VEEGix) will be identified and the diagnostic value&#xD;
      to accurately detect delirium of these features will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: To investigate the accuracy and rapidity of delirium diagnosis with the&#xD;
      VEEGix.&#xD;

    <time_frame>1 year recruitment</time_frame>
    <description>Variables will include 1) predominant background frequencies: delta 0-3.9 Hz, theta 4-7.9 Hz, alpha 8-11.9 Hz and beta 12-30 Hz and power spectrum (ratio of each frequency/total 0-30Hz), 2) EEG: symmetry (symmetric, mild asymmetry, marked asymmetry) and prevalence (continuous, nearly continuous (1-9% of suppression or attenuation), discontinuous (10-49% of suppression or attenuation), burst suppression or burst-attenuation (50-99% of suppression or attenuation), suppression (&gt;99% of suppression or attenuation) as measured by percentage per hour of recording)(19). As power across all frequency bands decreases significantly with age, children will be divided 0 to 6 months, 6 months to 3 years and 3-18 years old.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To investigate the accuracy and rapidity of delirium diagnosis with the VEEGix.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year recruitment</time_frame>
    <description>The diagnosis of delirium by the vEEGix will be defined as presence of EEG characteristics of delirium (identified in objective 1). Diagnosis of delirium by the vEEGix will be compared to the diagnosis of delirium by the medical team (confirmed by a adjudicating committee). Timing of delirium diagnosis will be compared: diagnosis by the medical team (defined as the first CAPD scores equal or greater than 9) versus diagnosis by the vEEGix (the beginning of the delirium episode will be defined as the appearance of these EEG characteristics).</description>

    <description>Amplitude-Integrated EEG can be achieved with a limited number of frontal electrodes. There is a new aEEG technology available: VEEGix, developed by NeuroServo Inc. It is a miniaturized aEEG, non-intrusive, portable and resistant to patient's movements. Its main advantage is its simplicity of use as a single adhesive strip including all electrodes is fixed to the patient's forehead and is connected to the VEEGix device</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Eligible for inclusion children 1) &lt;18 years; and 2) admitted to the PICU at the Centre&#xD;
        Hospitalier Universitaire Ste-Justine (CHUSJ). To select patients at high risk for&#xD;
        delirium, one of the following inclusion criteria will be needed: 3) mechanically&#xD;
        ventilated patients; or 4) non-invasively ventilated patients (BiPap, Cpap or high flow&#xD;
        nasal cannula); or 5) patients receiving opioids; or 6) patients receiving benzodiazepines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children 1) suspected of being brain death at the time of PICU entry (Glasgow Coma Scale&#xD;
        (GCS) 3 and loss of all brain stem reflexes); 2) with significant clinical developmental&#xD;
        delay (based on clinical assessment and/or parental report of developmental problems that&#xD;
        affected the child's behavior or ability to communicate; Pediatric Cerebral Performance&#xD;
        Category â‰¥4); 3) planned discharge from the PICU the same or next day.&#xD;
