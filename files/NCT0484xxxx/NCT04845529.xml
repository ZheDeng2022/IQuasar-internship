  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain-damaged patients can show severe neurological and cognitive deficits, and yet often&#xD;
      remain strikingly unaware of these symptoms: this condition is called anosognosia. The aim of&#xD;
      this study is to improve awareness in right-brain-damaged patients with Unilateral Spatial&#xD;
      Neglect (USN) following stroke using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). tDCS is&#xD;
      a neuromodulatory technique that delivers low-intensity current to the brain facilitating&#xD;
      (anodal tDCS) or inhibiting (cathodal tDCS) spontaneous neuronal activity. tDCS does not&#xD;
      induce activity in resting neuronal networks, but modulates spontaneous neuronal activity:&#xD;
      consequently, the amount and direction of effects critically depend on the previous state of&#xD;
      the neural structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will test USN patients showing anosognosia for neglect symptoms. Different brain areas&#xD;
      will be stimulated, to target explicit and implicit components of anosognosia, including&#xD;
      parietal and frontal brain regions.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to improve awareness in right-brain-damaged patients with USN&#xD;
      following stroke using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). tDCS is a&#xD;
      neuromodulatory technique that delivers a low-intensity direct current (e.g., 1-2 mA) to&#xD;
      cortical areas facilitating (anodal tDCS) or inhibiting (cathodal tDCS) spontaneous neuronal&#xD;
      activity. This stimulation is delivered by a stimulation device with two (or, rarely, more)&#xD;
      electrodes placed on the scalp. The electrode assembly most commonly used for tDCS comprises&#xD;
      (1) a conductive rubber electrode, (2) an electrode sponge, and (3) an electrolyte-based&#xD;
      contact medium (e.g., saline, gel, or conductive cream) to facilitate delivery of current to&#xD;
      the scalp, as well as (4) any materials used to shape these components or otherwise direct&#xD;
      current flow (plastic casing, rivets). The tDCS mechanism of action is a subthreshold&#xD;
      modulation of neuronal membrane potentials, which alters cortical excitability and activity&#xD;
      dependent on the current flow direction through the target neurons. tDCS does not induce&#xD;
      activity in resting neuronal networks, but modulates spontaneous neuronal activity:&#xD;
      consequently, the amount and direction of effects critically depend on the previous&#xD;
      physiological state of the target neural structures. In this sense, tDCS represents a&#xD;
      neuromodulatory technique which do not induce massive synchronized discharge of action&#xD;
      potentials as the Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The introduction of tDCS in the clinical context took place about 15 years ago. Seminal&#xD;
      studies demonstrated that weak, direct electric currents could be delivered effectively&#xD;
      transcranially: specifically, anodal direct current stimulation was shown to increase&#xD;
      cortical excitability, whereas cathodal stimulation decreased it. tDCS has been tested in&#xD;
      thousands of subjects world-wide with no evidence of important side effects. For instance, it&#xD;
      has been used in healthy individuals to change the efficacy of various motor and cognitive&#xD;
      processes, with only mild and transient effects such as tingling and itching sensation under&#xD;
      the stimulation electrode, moderate fatigue and headache. Moreover, since it is&#xD;
      well-tolerated also in patients, a growing body of evidence is focused on the use of tDCS in&#xD;
      clinical context for rehabilitative purposes: after brain damage, the induction of&#xD;
      enhancement of the damaged hemisphere through anodal tDCS is effective in reducing the&#xD;
      cognitive deficits caused by the lesion (e.g., stimulating perilesional areas).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will select USN patients, showing anosognosia for neglect symptoms, from a previous study.&#xD;
      If only a few patients will accept to participate in this protocol, new right-brain-damaged&#xD;
      patients will be recruited at HUG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A protocol using anodal tDCS (i.e., excitatory stimulation) will be administered. We will&#xD;
      target brain areas that could be involved in anosognosia for USN and, if these sites are&#xD;
      damaged by the lesion, perilesional unimpaired regions will be stimulated, as the rationale&#xD;
      is that excitatory stimulation of these sites can restore the defective error monitoring, and&#xD;
      temporarily ameliorate anosognosia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and immediately after each stimulation, the three measures of anosognosia (i.e.,&#xD;
      explicit self-rating, SCR and EEG error-related potentials) will be recorded: this procedure&#xD;
      has been chosen in order to compare the tDCS effects on the different features of&#xD;
      anosognosia. To control for the size of the parietal and frontal damage, which could&#xD;
      influence the beneficial effect of tDCS, we will estimate the number of voxels damaged in&#xD;
      these regions through the lesion maps of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each one of the three experimental sessions is expected to last no more than 2h30min. This&#xD;
      includes: 15/20min to welcome the participant, explaining the experiment and make him sign&#xD;
      the informed consent and the screening criteria for tDCS ; 30min of neuropsychological&#xD;
      screening (only for patients who did not undergo Study 1 or only for the first session);&#xD;
      20min of preparation of the set-up (connecting the cables for SCR, placing the EEG cap and&#xD;
      connecting all the electrodes, installing the tDCS electrodes); 60min for the experiment's&#xD;
      recording (anosognosia + tDCS + anosognosia); 10/15min for cleaning up the set up and doing a&#xD;
      short debriefing with the participant.&#xD;

Averaged evoked potentials for each domain of awareness will be computed, and a baseline correction will be applied to the epochs. The first error-related component (ERN) will be determined as the mean amplitude in the time window from 60 ms to 140 ms post-response onset; the second component of interest (Pe) will be determined as the mean amplitude in the time-window from 200 ms and 600 ms post-response onset.</description>
