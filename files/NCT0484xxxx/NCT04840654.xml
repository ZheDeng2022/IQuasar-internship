  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will compare recovery profile in children receiving pudendal blocks vs caudal&#xD;
      analgesia for ambulatory circumcision or hypospadias repair in children between 6 months and&#xD;
      2 years. The subjects of the study will be randomized to receive either a caudal or a&#xD;
      pudendal block.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study participation will begin on the day of surgery and end at the time of last surgical&#xD;
      follow-up visit, approximately two weeks later. All procedure related, follow-up clinic visit&#xD;
      and PACU data will be collected by the research team from the patient's EPIC record&#xD;
      (demographic data, pain scores in the PACU, analgesic consumption, time to perform block,&#xD;
      time to discharge, etc). Data pertaining to the recovery of patient at home will be collected&#xD;
      via phone call or email to the caregiver of the child. Late complications will be identified&#xD;
      by reviewing the follow-up surgical note.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire Administration The physical Pain journal/questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physical Pain journal/questionnaires will be handed out to the caregiver before discharge&#xD;
      from the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit. The answers to the Pain Journal/Questionnaire will be&#xD;
      retrieved in 3 potential ways (depending on the caregiver's preference or availability):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. By phone call at 24-48h&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. By answering a REDCap questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Bringing the physical forms to the surgeon's office at the 2 week visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      The caregiver will fill out pain scores at home in the Pain Journal. The pain scores used&#xD;
      (FLACC and PPPM) have been extensively validated. In addition, written instructions for using&#xD;
      the pain scores to guide pain management interventions at home will be provided. Prior to&#xD;
      discharge, caregivers will also be educated by a member of the research team on pain&#xD;
      evaluation using the pain score and pain management algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The caregiver will be asked to answer a short questionnaire (Postoperative Parent Survey)&#xD;
      about their child pain in the first 24 hours after discharge from the hospital. The caregiver&#xD;
      will receive a phone call from the research team 24-48 hours after discharge to retrieve the&#xD;
      results of the Pain Journal and Postoperative Pain Survey. If the parent could not be&#xD;
      contacted by phone after two attempts, an email containing a REDCap survey with the same&#xD;
      questions from the Pain Journal and Pain Survey will be sent automatically after discharge to&#xD;
      the caregiver, in the hope that the parent would be able to answer the questions at a more&#xD;
      convenient time. The email will contain a REDCap survey with the same questions from the Pain&#xD;
      Journal and Pain Survey.&#xD;
