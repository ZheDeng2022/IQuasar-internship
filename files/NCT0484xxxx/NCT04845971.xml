    <textblock>
      As of August 16, 2020, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has&#xD;
      been responsible for more than 21 294 000 infections and about 760 000 deaths worldwide.&#xD;
      Accumulating evidence suggests that patients with severe acute COVID-19 pneumonia have a&#xD;
      cytokine storm syndrome, or unbalanced hyper-inflammatory response. It is now well known that&#xD;
      GcMAF plays a crucial role in immune system regulation as a primary defense against&#xD;
      infections. Thus, this multifunctional protein, released into the blood stream, acts as a&#xD;
      systemic immune modulator without pro-inflammatory activities. In an animal study, IL-6 level&#xD;
      was shown to be dramatically decreased after 21 days of oral administration colostrum MAF.&#xD;
      Indeed, data from previous studies and clinical practice have been reported its effectiveness&#xD;
      and safety in the treatment of many pathologies such as infectious diseases, some types of&#xD;
      cancer, juvenile osteopetrosis, immunological, and neurological diseases. These observations&#xD;
      suggest that oral immunotherapy with colostrum-MAF is potentially an effective and&#xD;
      well-tolerated treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia. In addition, gastrointestinal involvement is&#xD;
      well known in coronavirus infections of animals and humans. The angiotensin-converting enzyme&#xD;
      II (ACE2), the entry receptor for SARS-CoV, is highly expressed in proximal and distal&#xD;
      enterocytes that are directly exposed to foreign pathogens. It considers the mechanism of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 can actively infect and replicate in the gastrointestinal tract. SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      indirectly damages the digestive system through a chain of inflammatory responses. Delivered&#xD;
      topically to the small intestine by an acid-resistant enteric-coated capsule colostrum MAF&#xD;
      can directly activate a large number of gut mucosal macrophages for virus control, localizing&#xD;
      intestinal inflammation and resolving through driven phagocytic scavenger function.&#xD;
      Macrophages in the gastrointestinal mucosa represent the largest pool of tissue macrophages&#xD;
      in the body, which besides the local functions are directing the systemic immune response.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the last five months, there have been increasing numbers of reports that struggle to&#xD;
      understand the pathogenesis of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. To date, the&#xD;
      most commonly investigated hypothesis about the underlying mechanisms of multi-organ failure&#xD;
      may be summarized into three main targets: microcirculation dysfunction, overwhelming&#xD;
      inflammation and abnormal coagulation. Clinical, radiologic and laboratory findings, as well&#xD;
      as preliminary autopsy studies, seem to support this hypothesis. As widely suggested, the&#xD;
      systemic cytokine storm could play a key role in the virus-induced tissue damage. Being the&#xD;
      knowledge of this issue very scarce, lessons learned from other human pathogenic viruses,&#xD;
      with specific reference to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), could be diriment.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, no drug or vaccine has yet been approved to treat human coronaviruses and new&#xD;
      interventions based on drugs directly active on the virus itself are likely to require months&#xD;
      to years to develop. The main targets of the pharmacologic approaches to COVID-19, especially&#xD;
      for the complicated cases, are addressed to modulate the immune system and counteract the&#xD;
      overwhelming inflammation. Notably, the mechanisms the investigators have hypothesized about&#xD;
      the possible pathogenesis of the cell and tissue damage induced by SARS-CoV-2 seem to provide&#xD;
      a common denominator in explaining the effects of most drugs currently in use in the clinical&#xD;
      trials: these include antivirals, immunomodulating and/or anti-inflammatory drugs. In&#xD;
      particular, based on their antiviral activity, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, initially&#xD;
      conceived as antimalarial therapeutics, were proposed to treat hospitalized patients with&#xD;
      COVID-19, with or without azithromycin, showing promising efficacy in &quot;inhibiting the&#xD;
      exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings, promoting a virus negative&#xD;
      conversion and shortening the disease course&quot;. On the other hand, hydroxychloroquine is the&#xD;
      cornerstone of medical therapy in lupus, where it acts as an immunomodulatory without&#xD;
      immunosuppressive effects. However, because of the lack of evidence about the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of these drugs, the Italian Medicines Agency on July 17 said it had withdrawn an&#xD;
      emergency approval for use of the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine or antivirals as a Covid-19&#xD;
      treatment out of clinical trials. Meanwhile the use of low-molecular-weight heparin for&#xD;
      COVID-19 is restricted only to well selected hospitalized patients. Tocilizumab, an IL-6&#xD;
      antagonist, approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile idiopathic&#xD;
      arthritis, also had initial therapeutic application in critical COVID-19 patients, providing&#xD;
      encouraging results. However, the phase III clinical trial (COVACTA) for evaluating&#xD;
      tocilizumab in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia found no difference&#xD;
      between tocilizumab versus placebo in intensive care requirements or mortality. The rationale&#xD;
      basis for the use of monoclonal antibodies in patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 seems to lie in&#xD;
      the so-called systemic cytokine storm. Taking into account the key role of VEGF in enhancing&#xD;
      angiogenesis in acute lung injury and ARDS, two trials, evaluating the efficacy of&#xD;
      bevacizumab as VEGF antagonist in the treatment of COVID-19 (BEST-PC and BEST-RCT), were also&#xD;
      started. In light of pathological findings of pulmonary inflammation with edema and hyaline&#xD;
      membrane formation, timely and appropriate use of drugs with understood safety profiles aimed&#xD;
      at reducing inflammation, microcirculatory dysfunction, oxidative stress, neoangiogenesis and&#xD;
      microthrombotic occlusion, in a targeted way, together with ventilator support, should be&#xD;
      considered for the severe patients to prevent and treat ARDS development. It is now well&#xD;
      known that GcMAF plays a crucial role in immune system regulation as a primary defense&#xD;
      against infections. Based on the aforementioned findings and on documented analogies between&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 and HIV, the investigators hypothesized that the reduced conversion activity of&#xD;
      the Gc protein into the macrophage activating factor (MAF) could have a key role in the&#xD;
      dysregulate immune response induced by SARS-CoV-2, just like for HIV infected patients. If&#xD;
      this hypothesis is correct, it might help to set a valid strategy of immunotherapy also based&#xD;
      on an off-label use of GcMAF in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Serum Gc protein, also&#xD;
      known as vitamin D-binding protein (DBP), is a multifunctional protein present in&#xD;
      plasma/serum at concentrations of 300-600 mg/L. Stepwise hydrolysis of Gc protein by the&#xD;
      inducible membranous β-galactosidase of stimulated B-lymphocytes, and by the Neu-1 sialidase&#xD;
      of T-lymphocytes converts it into the active GcMAF.On the contrary, deglycosilation of Gc&#xD;
      protein by action of the enzyme alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, named nagalase, secreted&#xD;
      from HIV-infected cells leads to lack of macrophage activation and to immunosuppression, as a&#xD;
      consequence. It is remarkable that nagalase was demonstrated to be an intrinsic component not&#xD;
      only of the envelope glycoproteins gp120 and gp160 of HIV but also of the hemagglutinin (HE)&#xD;
      of influenza virus and even produced by neoplastic cells. Indeed, flu-like symptoms with&#xD;
      serum nagalase activity similar to the influenza acute state were reported in the early stage&#xD;
      of HIV-infection, so that the serum enzyme activity may be detectable at all phases of&#xD;
      HIV-infection. Similarly, most COVID-19 patients complained of flu-like symptoms in the early&#xD;
      stages of the disease. In addition to the storage and transport of active vitamin D3, GcMAF's&#xD;
      effects include macrophage modulation, osteoclast activation, facilitation of neutrophil&#xD;
      chemotaxis mediated by C5 derived peptide, superoxide activity, scavenging of circulating&#xD;
      G-actin, anti-angiogenetic and anti-tumor properties. Thus, this multifunctional protein,&#xD;
      released into the blood stream, acts as a systemic immune modulator without pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      activities. This means that any function impairment of Gc-globulin could result in a state of&#xD;
      both immunosuppression and uncontrolled inflammation, just like in severe COVID-19.&#xD;
      Interestingly, HIV viremia was associated with higher level of biomarkers of inflammation&#xD;
      (measured by IL-6), monocyte activation (soluble CD14), and coagulation (D-dimer), leading to&#xD;
      increased mortality, as compared with uninfected people. Meanwhile, in COVID-19 patients, in&#xD;
      addition to the reduced peripheral lymphocyte counts, mainly CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells, there&#xD;
      were found significant high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Indeed,&#xD;
      GcMAF is not only a simple potent activator for macrophages, but more specifically is able to&#xD;
      turn macrophage activity on at the sites of infection/inflammation and then to induce their&#xD;
      apoptosis by upregulating caspase activity via the p38 and JNK1/2 pathways when no longer&#xD;
      needed. Post-mortem lung observations of patients died of COVID-19 showed the presence of&#xD;
      mononuclear cells and macrophages infiltrating air spaces by autopsy. With regards to the&#xD;
      anti-oxidant properties, it was assessed that GcMAF promotes the superoxide generating&#xD;
      capacity of activated macrophages and the production of nitric oxide (NO). It has been showed&#xD;
      that the expression of extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) mRNA and protein is cell-&#xD;
      and tissue-specific and is prominent in lung, heart, blood vessels, placenta and kidney. In&#xD;
      particular, high levels of EC-SOD are present in lung macrophages, alveolar type II cells,&#xD;
      fibroblasts, vascular smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells. EC-SOD limits oxidative&#xD;
      stress and preserves NO bioactivity, thus protecting against a number of lung and&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases. Even though only in a minority of cases, COVID-19 may progress to&#xD;
      life-threatening complications, including respiratory failure, acute cardiac injury, acute&#xD;
      kidney injury, septic shock, disseminated intra-vascular coagulation (DIC), and multi-organ&#xD;
      dysfunction. Hypoxemia was found to be associated with interstitial pneumonia and, in 10% to&#xD;
      20% of cases, developed into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In this connection,&#xD;
      it was documented that ARDS as well as organ dysfunction and septic shock is characterized by&#xD;
      actin release which is involved in microvascular impairment. DBP has an additional function&#xD;
      in binding monomeric globular (G)-actin with high affinity. Thereby, rapidly removing&#xD;
      polymeric actin fibrils from the blood stream, it prevents actin polymers from clogging the&#xD;
      micro vessels not unlike fibrinogen/fibrin and consequently platelet aggregation and micro&#xD;
      thrombi formation. What the investigators postulated could also explain hypercoagulability&#xD;
      with elevated concentrations of D-dimer, fibrin degradation products increase, PT and aPTT&#xD;
      prolongation, observed in COVID-19 patients. It has been reported that 71.4% of the non&#xD;
      survivors of COVID-19 matched the grade of overt-DIC according to the International Society&#xD;
      on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) diagnostic criteria for DIC. Murine models deficient in&#xD;
      DBP showed lung damage caused by actin polymerization, developing severe acute lung&#xD;
      inflammation with vascular leakage, hemorrhage and thickening of the vascular wall after&#xD;
      actin injection. Interestingly, the lung was the only organ that showed inflammatory injury&#xD;
      after intravenous actin injection. The observed lung inflammation was consistent with&#xD;
      alterations to lung microvascular endothelial cells. Indeed, when lung endothelial cells were&#xD;
      exposed to DBP-actin complexes in vitro showed enhanced cell death. Reduced levels of DBP&#xD;
      were even observed in sepsis and organ dysfunction of trauma patients as well as complete&#xD;
      depletion of free DBP in those affected by septic shock. These data could provide support for&#xD;
      pathogenic explanations of cellular and tissue damage by SARS-CoV-2 and, at the same time,&#xD;
      for the therapeutic use of DBP to bind extracellular actin and counteract microcirculatory&#xD;
      alterations. Whereas DBP also binds free fatty acids, it was shown that the administration of&#xD;
      GcMAF complexed with oleic acid (OA) via nebulisation or subcutaneous injection led to rapid&#xD;
      decrease of blood pressure and increase in splenic blood flow, as a result of a verisimilar&#xD;
      synergistic NO release by OA-GcMAF-activated alveolar and splenic macrophages. Severe or&#xD;
      critically ill COVID-19 patients developed clinical typical manifestations of shock, even in&#xD;
      the absence of overt hypotension. Furthermore, it was found that GcMAF can inhibit the&#xD;
      angiogenesis induced by pro-inflammatory prostaglandin E1, which serves roles in the&#xD;
      promotion of VEGF expression. A key role of VEGF in acute lung injury and ARDS was confirmed.&#xD;
      Reflecting the fact that clinical features and severity of symptoms vary widely between and&#xD;
      within each COVID-19 patient, with older males more likely to be affected and in a more&#xD;
      severe manner, the investigators sought to relate it with some special feature of DBP.&#xD;
      Several studies showed that the polymorphisms of DBP were associated with susceptibility or&#xD;
      resistance to disease states including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Moreover,&#xD;
      whereas androgens were not found to have any effect on circulating levels of DBP, exposure to&#xD;
      high levels of estrogens increased them by up to 50%, suggesting a potential protective role&#xD;
      of estrogens against COVID-19. On the other hand, in relation to vitamin D status, advanced&#xD;
      age was recognized as one of the major risk factors for vitamin D deficiency. Animal-based&#xD;
      studies also demonstrated that deficiencies in both dietary protein- and energy-intake&#xD;
      decreased the concentration of DBP in the circulation. These data seem to be in line with the&#xD;
      growing evidence that vitamin D supplementation could reduce the risk of COVID-19 infections&#xD;
      and deaths. The present trial aims to assess the efficacy and safety of immunotherapy with&#xD;
      oral MAF plus standard-of-care therapy in hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19- induced&#xD;
      pneumonia.&#xD;
