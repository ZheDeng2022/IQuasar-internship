  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Learning a person's name, new words, or simply remembering where the last conversation with a&#xD;
      friend was held are examples of associative memory, frequently disturbed in brain&#xD;
      pathologies, but also by aging. Although typically dependent on the hippocampus in the brain,&#xD;
      a series of findings suggest that associative memory may persist, under certain&#xD;
      circumstances, despite hippocampal damage. The ANéRAVIMM project aims to reveal this learning&#xD;
      system, its cognitive and cerebral bases, and to evaluate its potential in patients with&#xD;
      memory disorders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Three experimental cognitive tasks will be used in the ANéRAVIMM study. The first two tasks&#xD;
      have been selected based on the literature and previous work of CHU Rennes team. They are two&#xD;
      experiments that have produced promising results concerning the existence of a rapid&#xD;
      neocortical learning system in declarative memory, and have in common the use of prior&#xD;
      knowledge to promote learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first part of the study, these two tasks will be put in competition for their&#xD;
      resistance to the effects of age. Brain aging is characterized by its deleterious impact on&#xD;
      hippocampal functioning, and memory aging leads to an alteration of associative memory.&#xD;
      Therefore, this first part will allow the learning paradigm that presents the best potential&#xD;
      in brain-damaged patients to be retained in the second part of the ANéRAVIMM study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third task stems from recent work by CHU Rennes team in collaboration with Dr. Besson of&#xD;
      the University of Liege, in the context of a very recent model of memory. It aims at&#xD;
      estimating the ability to develop a representation of visual objects in memory at the entity&#xD;
      level, i.e. an integrated representation, unifying all the perceptual, conceptual and&#xD;
      contextual features of perceived information. This task has been adapted for the ANéRAVIMM&#xD;
      project in order to test the hypothesis that this mnemonic representational level of the&#xD;
      entity in memory could support rapid neocortical associative learning in declarative memory.&#xD;
