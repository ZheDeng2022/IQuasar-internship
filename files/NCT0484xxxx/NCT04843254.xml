      The aim of the present study is to translate the Stroke Specific Quality of Life&#xD;
      Questionnaire into local languages of Pakistan along with validation of the translated&#xD;
      versions by evaluating their validity and reliability in the people of Pakistan, speaking&#xD;
      respective languages and suffering from a stroke. No such study has been previously conducted&#xD;
      in the Pakistan region which translates the specific questionnaire and follows the proper&#xD;
      cross-culture adaptation protocol.&#xD;

      The stroke-Specific Quality of Life Scale is regarded as one of the most extensive and more&#xD;
      commonly utilized patient-centred and self-reported measure of outcomes in the stroke&#xD;
      population. The SS-QoL scale is a health-related outcome measure that comprises 49 items in&#xD;
      12 areas of vision, mobility, thinking, social roles, self-care, language, personality,&#xD;
      family roles, work/productivity, upper limb function, mood and energy. It covers a more&#xD;
      extensive inclusion of capacities ordinarily influenced by stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Stroke Specific Quality of Life questionnaire, originally developed in English, has been&#xD;
      translated into many languages to assess for its validity and reliability ever since, but not&#xD;
      any of the Pakistani native versions are made or tested. Previous studies have shown that the&#xD;
      translation of the scale would end up giving a standard measure to be utilized in clinical&#xD;
      practices and research studies while sanctioning clinicians and specialists to share&#xD;
      information and have an insight into patient's health-related concerns post-stroke. Thus, it&#xD;
      is imperative to translate this questionnaire into psychometrically sound versions of&#xD;
      indigenous Pakistani languages such as Urdu, Punjabi, Sindhi, Balochi and Pashto. This may&#xD;
      promote an easy understanding of the local population in Pakistan where the languages are&#xD;
      spoken and will provide a valid measure of stroke-specific health outcomes to be clinically&#xD;
      utilized by practitioners and researchers across the country.&#xD;

    <description>The Stroke Specific Quality of Life Scale (SSQoL) is regarded as one of the most extensive and more commonly utilized patient-centred and self-reported measure of outcomes in the stroke population. It is a health-related stroke outcome measure intended to gather all the relevant concerns significant to the stroke population. The responses are obtained via a progression of a series of centred meetings and interviews with concerned post-stroke patients to survey personal satisfaction. The SS-QoL comprises 49 items in 12 areas of vision, mobility, thinking, social roles, self-care, language, personality, family roles, work/productivity, upper limb function, mood and energy. The patient responses are appraised on a Likert scale consisting of 5 points with greater scores demonstrating better capacity. It covers a more extensive inclusion of capacities ordinarily influenced by stroke. Its translation is to be done in the local languages of Pakistan through a rigorous and approved process.</description>

    <measure>Reliability and Validity of translated versions</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>To determine reliability and validity of cross-culturally adapted and the translated versions of SSQoL in stroke patients with respective languages. Reliability or reproducibility refers to the ability of a measure to produce the same results when administered at two or more interval between different visits of the patient and validity is how accurate the tool measures an item it is supposed to. Thus these both are to measured through various parameters to validate the translated versions as appropriate and applicable.</description>
