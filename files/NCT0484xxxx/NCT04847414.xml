      Aim of our work:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First aim: Classify patients with adult-onset diabetes according to the novel classification&#xD;
      into new subgroups, depending on multiple variables related clinically to those patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second aim: To identify the association between the new classification subgroups and the&#xD;
      presence of common microvascular complications (retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy),&#xD;
      which can help in the early prediction of these complications and their early management.&#xD;

      We will conduct an observational cross-sectional study and cluster analysis for patients from&#xD;
      different Diabetes clinics and tertiary centres located in different governorates in Upper&#xD;
      Egypt. Our participants in this study will be divided into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The first group will be as a prospective group, All necessary examinations and&#xD;
           investigations will be performed for every patient of this group during their clinic&#xD;
           visit at the time of registration to this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The second group will be the retrospective group. Data for those patients will be&#xD;
           collected from electronic records and/or paper records in collaboration with different&#xD;
           diabetes centres and clinics scattered in Upper Egypt governorates. We will collect&#xD;
           clinical and lab data as much as we can. All available data for this group at end of&#xD;
           this study will be used in the clustering of this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then we will use the above data from both groups to classify diabetic patients to the new&#xD;
      clusters and to find the association between those clusters and the incidence of&#xD;
      microvascular complications.&#xD;
