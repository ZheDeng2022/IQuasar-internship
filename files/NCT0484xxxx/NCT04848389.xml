  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Skin adhesive (Octyl cyanoacrylate - LIQUID BAND©) is increasingly used instead of suture for&#xD;
      sutures on the superficial plane of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is frequently used in children, in traumatology and in plastic surgery. Several randomized&#xD;
      trials have shown satisfactory results of the glue compared to suture in terms of infections&#xD;
      and scar dehiscence, and aesthetics after abdominoplasty and mammoplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the field of port-a-cath® placement in oncology:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The use of skin adhesive can save substantial nursing time, which makes it possible to&#xD;
           consider the transition of this technique into routine patient management. Potential&#xD;
           benefits include nurses managing large numbers of patients in day hospitals, and&#xD;
           patients no longer needing a nurse for suture removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cancer and chemotherapy toxicity can alter patients' body image and view of themselves.&#xD;
           The presence of a scar can be traumatic for some patients. The second goal of this study&#xD;
           is to test whether the use of glue can improve the appearance of the scar following&#xD;
           port-a-cath® placement, an area in which there are divergent results.&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical shape of the scar (POSAS scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome correspond to the POSAS scale which is a reliable and valid scar assessment scale that measures scar quality from two perspectives: the patient and the clinician. The POSAS measures scar quality in all types of scars. The observer scale of the POSAS consists of six items (vascularity, pigmentation, thickness, relief, pliability and surface area). All items are scored on a scale ranging from 1 ('like normal skin') to 10 ('worst scar imaginable'). The sum of the six items results in a total score of the POSAS observer scale. Categories boxes are added for each item. Furthermore, an overall opinion is scored on a scale ranging from 1 to 10. All parameters should preferably be compared to normal skin on a comparable anatomic location.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient's comfort</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome correspond to the assessment of the patient's comfort at D30 during the implantation with the tissue adhesive comparing to the sutures.1. In the time between the installation of PAC and visit , did patient use for PAC? a home health aide or a nurse? 2. Did patient visit his general practitioner in this interval for your PAC? Yes or No 3. On a scale of 0 to 10, what pain are patient experiencing today? 4. On a scale of 0 to 10, how much discomfort are patient experiencing today? 5. Following PACplacement, how soon were patient able to resume showering in days? 6. Following the placement of the PAC, how soon were patient able to resume a normal life in days?</description>
