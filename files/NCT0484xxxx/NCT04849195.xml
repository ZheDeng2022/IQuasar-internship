    <textblock>
      Using traditional machine learning classifiers, this study targets on comparing bag-of-words,&#xD;
      word2cec and roberta on automated ICD coding related to cardiovascular diseases in Chinese&#xD;
      corpus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ICD coding is quite important as it serves as basis for a wide range of economic and academic&#xD;
      applications. Currently, manual coding is mainly adopted, which faces several limits like&#xD;
      being time-consuming and prone to error, and this makes automated ICD coding via machine&#xD;
      learning a hot research topic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an inevitable phase during machine learning, feature engineering plays a crucially&#xD;
      important role in leading to promising coding performance. Although have reached enlightening&#xD;
      conclusions, existing studies lacked comparison of different feature engineering methods.&#xD;
      Finding out what methods under what circumstances perform better can be quite helpful in&#xD;
      promoting practical applications of automated coding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will implement this study based on inpatient' data collected from&#xD;
      electronic medical records from Fuwai Hospital, the world's largest medical center for&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. Bag-of-words, word2cec and roberta will be respectively used to&#xD;
      extracted features from training data. Then code-wise logistic regression classifiers and&#xD;
      support vector machine classifiers will be trained to auto-assign codes. Afterwards,&#xD;
      performances of the models on test data will be evaluated.&#xD;
