  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is an increasingly important medical and public health issue. The prevalence of&#xD;
      hypertension increases with advancing age to the point where more than half of people 60-69&#xD;
      years of age and approximately three-fourths of those 70 years of age and older are affected.&#xD;
      The age related rise in SBP is primarily responsible for an increase in both incidence and&#xD;
      prevalence of hypertension with increasing age. At present, it is estimated that about 1&#xD;
      billion people worldwide have hypertension (&gt;140/90 mmHg), and this number is expected to&#xD;
      increase to 1.56 billion by 2025.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the new data on lifetime risk of hypertension and the impressive increase in the&#xD;
      risk of cardiovascular complications associated with levels of BP previously considered to be&#xD;
      normal, the JNC 7 report has introduced a new classification that includes the term&#xD;
      &quot;prehypertension&quot; for those with BPs ranging from 120-139 mmHg systolic and/or 80-89 mmHg&#xD;
      diastolic. This new designation is intended to identify those individuals in whom early&#xD;
      intervention by adoption of healthy lifestyles could reduce BP, decrease the rate of&#xD;
      progression of BP to hypertensive levels with age, or prevent hypertension entirely.&#xD;
      Prehypertension is not a disease category. Rather, it is a designation chosen to identify&#xD;
      individuals at high risk of developing hypertension, so that both patients and clinicians are&#xD;
      alerted to this risk and encouraged to intervene and prevent or delay the disease from&#xD;
      developing. Individuals who are pre hypertensive are not candidates for drug therapy based on&#xD;
      their level of BP and should be firmly and unambiguously advised to practice lifestyle&#xD;
      modification in order to reduce their risk of developing hypertension in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal for individuals with prehypertension and no compelling indications is to lower BP to&#xD;
      normal levels with lifestyle changes, and prevent the progressive rise in BP using the&#xD;
      recommended lifestyle modifications.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adoption of healthy lifestyles by all persons is critical for the prevention of high BP and&#xD;
      is an indispensable part of the management of those with hypertension. Weight loss of as&#xD;
      little as 10 lbs (4.5 kg) reduces BP and/or prevents hypertension in a large proportion of&#xD;
      overweight persons, although the ideal is to maintain normal body weight. BP is also&#xD;
      benefited by adoption of the Dietary approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan which&#xD;
      is a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low fat dairy products with a reduced content of&#xD;
      dietary cholesterol as well as saturated and total fat (modification of whole diet). It is&#xD;
      rich in potassium and calcium content. Dietary sodium should be reduced to no more than 100&#xD;
      mmol per day (2.4 g of sodium). Everyone who is able should engage in regular aerobic&#xD;
      physical activity such as brisk walking at least 30 minutes per day most days of the week.&#xD;
      Lifestyle modifications reduce BP, prevent or delay the incidence of hypertension, enhance&#xD;
      antihypertensive drug efficacy and decrease cardiovascular risk. For example, in some&#xD;
      individuals, a 1,600 mg sodium DASH eating plan has BP effects similar to single drug&#xD;
      therapy. Combinations of two (or more) lifestyle modifications can achieve even better&#xD;
      results. For overall cardiovascular risk reduction, patients should be strongly counseled to&#xD;
      quit smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lifestyle modification involves altering long-term habits, typically of eating or physical&#xD;
      activity, and maintaining the new behavior for months or years. Lifestyle changes are a more&#xD;
      natural way toward therapeutic goals and should be an integral component of halting or even&#xD;
      reversing early vascular aging as in pre hypertensive subjects. From a public health&#xD;
      perspective, even a small reduction in BP should have a tremendous, beneficial effect on the&#xD;
      occurrence of hypertension and its complications. In view of the current epidemic of&#xD;
      BP-related diseases and the proven effects of lifestyle modifications on BP, the current&#xD;
      challenge to health care providers, researchers, and public officials is to develop and&#xD;
      implement effective life style intervention program comprising exercise dietary and educative&#xD;
      component in clinical and public health strategies that achieve and maintain healthy&#xD;
      lifestyle modification&#xD;
