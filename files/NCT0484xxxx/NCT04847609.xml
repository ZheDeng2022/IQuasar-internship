  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the rate of occurrence of urethral pain in female&#xD;
      patients with neurological vesico-sphincter disorders whilst performing self-catheterization&#xD;
      using GentleCath™ Air catheters.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intermittent catheterisation involves the insertion and removal of a hollow flexible tube&#xD;
      called a catheter to drain urine from the bladder. Intermittent catheterisation allows the&#xD;
      individual to empty their bladder without the need for a long term indwelling catheter and&#xD;
      can be implemented for people who have difficulty emptying their bladder due to neurogenic&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the complaints of female patients performing intermittent self-catheterization for&#xD;
      neurological bladder is the occurrence of urethral pain on insertion or removal of the&#xD;
      catheter, in particular in patients retaining sensitivity at this level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GentleCath™ Air catheter was designed to improve its tolerance and in particular to&#xD;
      reduce the risk of pain. However, no studies have addressed this in real life. Therefore, the&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to investigate the rate of occurrence of urethral pain when using&#xD;
      GentleCath™ Air catheters as a bladder emptying method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this multicentre observational study each subject will participate for 90 days. Women&#xD;
      under the care of the participating investigator and receiving their first prescription of&#xD;
      GentleCath Air catheter for urinary dysfunction due to neurological disorders will be&#xD;
      approached for potential participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the pain assessment score measured on a VAS (Visual Analog Scale)&#xD;
      during insertion and removal of the GentleCath™ Air catheter in naive female patients with&#xD;
      confirmed neurological pathway on D1, D3, D7, D14, D21, D28, D35, D45 and D90.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes will be to assess the patients' satisfaction of self-catheterization&#xD;
      (based on InCaSaQ score) at D45 and D90, to describe patient compliance on D45 and D90, to&#xD;
      measure the post-voiding residue on inclusion on D45 and D90, to assess compliance with the&#xD;
      self-catheterization throughout study duration, to describe the tolerance of the GentleCath™&#xD;
      Air catheter throughout study duration and to measure the overall satisfaction on Gentle Cath&#xD;
      Air on D90.&#xD;
