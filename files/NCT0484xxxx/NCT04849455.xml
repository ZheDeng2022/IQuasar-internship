      To determine whether the addition of erector spinae plane (ESP) catheters to existing&#xD;
      multimodal analgesic regimen with intrathecal morphine provides superior postoperative&#xD;
      analgesia in patients undergoing hepatic resection compared with patients not receiving ESP&#xD;
      catheters.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatic resection surgery is especially painful and requires optimal postoperative pain&#xD;
      control for early mobilization and improved respiratory function. While there are many&#xD;
      options for pain control, including IV opioids and thoracic epidurals, their utility is often&#xD;
      limited by decreased metabolism and coagulopathy respectively. Our institution's current&#xD;
      regimen including multimodal analgesia combined with intrathecal morphine and physician&#xD;
      discretion with ESP catheters to facilitate postoperative pain management. However, the&#xD;
      duration of intrathecal morphine is 24 hours, which is not cover the duration of significant&#xD;
      post-operative leading to an increase in intravenous opioid consumption. ESP block is a&#xD;
      paraspinal fascial plane between the erector spinae muscle and the thoracic transverse&#xD;
      processes blocking the dorsal and ventral rami of the spinal nerves. This provides a&#xD;
      multi-dermatomal sensory block of the anterior, posterior and lateral thoracic and abdominal&#xD;
      walls. The addition of a catheter allows for a continuous infusion of local anesthetic. In&#xD;
      addition, unlike a hepatic resection with a thoracic epidural coagulation status is not a&#xD;
      concern. We believe that if patients' have improved post-operative pain control they will&#xD;
      have better participation in physical therapy, require less opioids and potentially have&#xD;
      shorter hospital length of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim: To determine if the addition of ESP catheters to multimodal pain regimen with&#xD;
      intrathecal morphine, would provide superior postoperative analgesia beyond the morphine's&#xD;
      twenty-four hour duration in patients undergoing hepatic resection compared to patients not&#xD;
      receiving ESP catheters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Patients undergoing hepatic resection will have improved postoperative&#xD;
      analgesia - based on mean opioid consumption and numeric rating scale pain scores - during&#xD;
      postoperative day (POD) 1, as defined by 24 hours after intrathecal morphine, to POD 3&#xD;
      following surgery when receiving routine multimodal analgesia with intrathecal morphine and&#xD;
      multimodal pain management with addition of ESP catheters versus multimodal analgesia with&#xD;
      intrathecal morphine alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Patients undergoing hepatic resection will have decreased incidence of&#xD;
      persistent postoperative pain - based on mean opioid consumption and standard of care numeric&#xD;
      rating scale pain scores during their hospital stay and at home- when receiving routine&#xD;
      multimodal analgesia with intrathecal morphine with addition ESP catheters versus multimodal&#xD;
      analgesia with intrathecal morphine alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be randomized, subject-masked, placebo-controlled, human subjects clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment. Consenting adults undergoing hepatic resection will be offered enrollment. Study&#xD;
      inclusion will be proposed to eligible patients prior to surgery. If a patient desires study&#xD;
      participation, written, informed consent will be obtained using a current UCSD Institutional&#xD;
      Review Board (IRB)-approved Informed Consent Form (ICF). Selection for inclusion will not be&#xD;
      based on gender, race, or socioeconomic status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a single-center (UCSD), randomized, controlled investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative Procedures. Following written, informed consent, we will record baseline&#xD;
      anthropomorphic information (age, sex, height, and weight) that is already provided by all&#xD;
      patients having surgery. After consenting and prior to surgery, patients will be randomized&#xD;
      (utilizing sealed envelopes with 1:1 ratio) to either intrathecal morphine and sham ESP&#xD;
      catheters or intrathecal morphine and active ESP catheters. Currently the decision to place&#xD;
      ESP catheters is at the discretion of the attending physician. The only difference for&#xD;
      subjects participating in the study (vs those not participating) will be that the placement&#xD;
      of ESP catheters and decision to activate them-currently standard-of-care and used daily at&#xD;
      UCSD because of clinical equipoise-will be determined randomly, instead of the physician&#xD;
      simply choosing him/herself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intrathecal morphine and sham ESP catheter group: In the preoperative holding area, all&#xD;
      subjects in this cohort, will have a peripheral intravenous (IV) catheter inserted, standard&#xD;
      noninvasive monitors applied, supplemental oxygen administered via a nasal cannula or face&#xD;
      mask, and positioned sitting. Midazolam and fentanyl (IV) will be titrated for patient&#xD;
      comfort, while ensuring that patients remain responsive to verbal cues. The area of insertion&#xD;
      will be cleaned with iodine povacrylex and isopropyl alcohol (DuraPrep Surgical Prepping&#xD;
      Solution, 3M St. Paul, MN USA), and a clear, sterile, fenestrated drape applied. After&#xD;
      identifying with palpation the desired interspace using sterile techniques with the midline&#xD;
      single shot spinal approach a 25g pencil point needle spinal needle is passed through an&#xD;
      introducer needle. After free flow of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) is established 300mcg of&#xD;
      intrathecal morphine is slowly injected with additional aspiration of CSF at the midpoint and&#xD;
      end of injection to confirm continued subarachnoid administration. Then bilateral T7-8 ESP&#xD;
      catheters will be taped onto the patient's back after administration of local anesthetic at&#xD;
      the site. The 0.2% ropivacaine infusions will be started at the ESP block catheter&#xD;
      immediately after catheter insertion with a total rate of 0.1ml per hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intrathecal morphine and ESP catheter group: Catheter insertion will adhere to current UCSD&#xD;
      standard-of-care. In the preoperative holding area, all subjects in this cohort, will have a&#xD;
      peripheral intravenous (IV) catheter inserted, standard noninvasive monitors applied,&#xD;
      supplemental oxygen administered via a nasal cannula or face mask, and positioned sitting. In&#xD;
      the preoperative holding area, all subjects in this cohort, will have a peripheral&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) catheter inserted, standard noninvasive monitors applied, supplemental&#xD;
      oxygen administered via a nasal cannula or face mask, and positioned sitting. Midazolam and&#xD;
      fentanyl (IV) will be titrated for patient comfort, while ensuring that patients remain&#xD;
      responsive to verbal cues. The area of insertion will be cleaned with iodine povacrylex and&#xD;
      isopropyl alcohol (DuraPrep Surgical Prepping Solution, 3M St. Paul, MN USA), and a clear,&#xD;
      sterile, fenestrated drape applied. After identifying with palpation the desired interspace&#xD;
      using sterile techniques with the midline single shot spinal approach a 25g pencil point&#xD;
      needle spinal needle is passed through an introducer needle. After free flow of CSF is&#xD;
      established 300mcg (200mcg for age &gt;65yrs or respiratory concerns) of intrathecal morphine is&#xD;
      slowly injected with additional aspiration of CSF at the midpoint and end of injection to&#xD;
      confirm continued subarachnoid administration. Then bilateral T7-8 ESP catheters will be&#xD;
      placed under ultrasound guidance. A catheter will be placed with saline with 1:200,000 of&#xD;
      epinephrine. To confirm catheter location 15 mls of 1% lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine&#xD;
      will be injected and the block sensory level will be confirmed with ice. A total of 30mls of&#xD;
      1% lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine will be used for bilateral catheter placement (15mls&#xD;
      per side). A Ropivacaine 0.2% infusions will be started at the ESP block catheter immediately&#xD;
      after catheter insertion with a total rate of 12mls per hour, 2mls/hr continuous infusion and&#xD;
      10ml set bolus every 120mins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Postoperative Pain Interventions: Intraoperatively the patient will have general&#xD;
      anesthesia. Postoperatively, both groups will be started on the same multimodal oral regimen&#xD;
      and followed by the Acute Pain Service (APS) as per APS standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current Standard Care: Currently, all patients undergoing hepatic resection receive&#xD;
      preoperative intrathecal morphine and at the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist the&#xD;
      patient may or may not receive ESP catheters as well as multimodal pain regimen managed by&#xD;
      APS. Intraoperatively general anesthesia. The only difference for subjects participating in&#xD;
      the study (vs those not participating) will be that they will be randomized to whether or not&#xD;
      they get ESP catheters. We will ensure that there are no patient contraindications to either&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: All data collection will be through standard UCSD nursing/therapy EPIC notes&#xD;
      and patient interviews in-person during hospitalization or via telephone call.&#xD;
