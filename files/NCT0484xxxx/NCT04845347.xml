  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test a consumer health light therapy device (Re-Timer) for women with&#xD;
      postpartum depression to better understand how it affects mood and the body clock (also&#xD;
      called the circadian clock).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be enrolled and randomized after baseline assessments. In addition&#xD;
      to using the Re-Timer light for 5 weeks participants will complete questionnaires at various&#xD;
      timepoints, record sleep information, wear an actigraph watch, and provide saliva samples.&#xD;
      Additionally, the sleep of the participants' infants will also be monitored using an&#xD;
      ankle-worn device (actigraph) and sleep diary at certain time-points as this may influence&#xD;
      the mother's mood/sleep, and in turn affect the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses regarding the bright light versus the placebo dim light of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  morning bright light therapy will produce greater improvement from pre- to&#xD;
           post-treatment on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  morning bright light therapy will lengthen the Phase angle difference (PAD) and this&#xD;
           will mediate change in depression symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  morning bright light therapy will produce greater improvements on self-reported&#xD;
           depression symptoms, excessive daytime sleepiness, maternal-infant bonding, social&#xD;
           functioning, and sleep-related impairment from pre- to post-treatment.&#xD;

    <time_frame>pre-treatment (baseline), post light therapy treatment (approximately week 5)</time_frame>
    <description>Clinician-rated depression symptom severity measure; Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-Seasonal Affective Version (SIGH-SAD) (29 item version) measures depressive symptoms on a continuous scale. Higher scores indicate worse outcomes. Scores can range from 0 -73, where 0 means no depression, and 73 is the greatest possible depression. Generally scores of 20 or higher represent clinical depression.</description>

    <measure>Change in Phase angle difference</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-treatment (baseline), post light therapy treatment (approximately week 5)</time_frame>
    <description>Phase angle difference is calculated as the time interval between the time of dim light melatonin onset and the midpoint of sleep.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report of depression symptoms. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression scale is scored from 0 to 30 where 0 is no depression and 30 is most severe depression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants complete this 8 item scale and select response from would never doze (0), to high chance of dozing (3). A score of ≥ 10 indicates excessive daytime sleepiness on the ESS.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) - Satisfaction with Participation in Social Roles (SPSR) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is 14 questions regarding social roles where participants select items on a 5-point Likert scale (1) to very much (5). The higher the score the more satisfaction.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Sleep-related impairment (SRI) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is an 8 question scale regarding sleep impairment where participants select items on a 6-point Likert scale not at all (0) to very much (5). The higher the score the more impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Social functioning as measured by the Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire (PBQ) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PBQ is a is a 25 question self-report measure of maternal-infant bonding. Items are scored on a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (always) to 5 (never), sum score ranging from 0 to 125; high = problematic.</description>
