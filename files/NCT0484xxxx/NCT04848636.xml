  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is prevalent worldwide and affects around 10% of people living&#xD;
      in developed health economies. As the kidney loses its function in patients with CKD, the&#xD;
      kidneys are unable to filter toxins out of the blood as efficiently as those of healthy&#xD;
      individuals. Arguably, sodium (salt) is the most relevant toxin in CKD and can build up in&#xD;
      the kidneys of patients with CKD. Salt build-up has also been found to occur in the heart&#xD;
      muscle tissue and could drive the development of scarring of the heart muscle tissue which&#xD;
      contributes to heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using sodium magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we would like to measure the levels of salt in&#xD;
      the heart muscle tissue. We will examine whether the heart muscle tissue has high salt&#xD;
      levels, and if so, whether this relates to any heart defects. A conventional proton MRI will&#xD;
      be done to measure heart function. The MRI images of healthy volunteers, CKD patients, and&#xD;
      those on hemodialysis will be analyzed for levels of salt and the findings will then be&#xD;
      compared to the cardiac biomarkers (proteins or enzymes that are released into the blood when&#xD;
      the heart is damaged or stressed) and fibrosis (scarring) measured from each patient's proton&#xD;
      MRI images to establish a possible correlation. This research has the potential to precede&#xD;
      additional studies that may investigate the effect of diuretics (a drug that increases the&#xD;
      production of urine) on the heart muscle tissue of CKD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using sodium magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), it is possible to measure the sodium content&#xD;
      in the cardiac tissue of patients with kidney disease. In this research study, it will be&#xD;
      investigated whether the elevated levels of sodium in patients with kidney disease is also&#xD;
      present in their hearts, and if so, whether this relates to cardiac abnormalities. Cardiac&#xD;
      sodium MRI images of healthy volunteers, hemodialysis patients, and CKD patients will be&#xD;
      analyzed for sodium content. This sodium information will then be compared to the biomarkers&#xD;
      of cardiac function and fibrosis measured from each patient's proton MRI images in order to&#xD;
      establish a possible correlation. This research has the potential to precede additional&#xD;
      studies that may investigate the effect of diuretics on the cardiac tissue of kidney disease&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot exploratory study (preliminary project to assess the use of a heart&#xD;
      sodium coil across a wide spectrum of kidney disease). We will recruit up to 150&#xD;
      participants: approximately 50 hemodialysis patients, 50 patients with various stages of&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease, and 50 age and sex matched healthy participants to compare clinical&#xD;
      characteristics to. This study involves one study visit at the Robarts Research Institute,&#xD;
      London, Ontario lasting approximately 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study entails one visit where all participants will undergo a proton and sodium MRI scan&#xD;
      of the heart. Prior to the scan, all participants will have their sitting blood pressure and&#xD;
      heart rate measured three times consecutively using a standard automatic blood pressure&#xD;
      monitor. In addition to this, all patient participants will have blood work collected,&#xD;
      provide a spot urine sample, complete a salt intake questionnaire, and have their fluid&#xD;
      volume measured using bioimpedance spectroscopy. Only those patients on hemodialysis will&#xD;
      answer a single Time to Recovery Question in addition to the above.&#xD;
