  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this prospective, non-randomized, single-arm study is to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      feasibility of sonodynamic therapy with 5-aminolevulinic acid in patients with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed cerebral glioblastomas using the ExAblate Model 4000 Type-2 &quot;Neuro-System&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be consented, screened, and will undergo study SDT treatment with 5-ALA using&#xD;
      the ExAblate Model 4000 Type-2 &quot;Neuro-System&quot;. After SDT treatment, patients will perform a&#xD;
      strict neuro-radiological follow-up (minimum of 2 MRI) and undergo tumor resection 14-21 days&#xD;
      after SDT, according to the clinical and radiological status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of the present study is to investigate the antitumor effects of SDT in patients&#xD;
      affected by HGGs attained with low-frequency focused ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety will be evaluated by patient examination and MRI during the treatment, and by&#xD;
           follow-up by daily clinical visits and MRI every 3 days. Data on the safety versus&#xD;
           adverse effects of this treatment will be acquired during each visit through a&#xD;
           combination of MRI evaluations, clinical assessments and neurological examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Feasibility will be evaluated performing serial MRI after SDT treatment evaluating tumor&#xD;
           size, morphology and peri-lesional edema until tumor resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy is not a primary endpoint. To evaluate the treatment effect, for each subject, the&#xD;
      following data will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor volume changes after SDT according to sonicated tumors volumes (by imaging).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histology after tumor resection, comprising assessment of apoptosis and necrosis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Despite progress made in many cancer treatments, high-grade gliomas (HGG) remain an&#xD;
      extraordinary challenge. Their aggressive and infiltrative nature, the limited efficacy and&#xD;
      inherent risk of surgical resection combined with radiotherapy, and the difficulty in&#xD;
      delivering anticancer drugs to the brain, make the prognosis for patients with gliomas grim.&#xD;
      Therefore, new and less-invasive alternatives to existing procedures are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) represents an emerging approach that offers the possibility of&#xD;
      non-invasively eradicating solid tumors in a site-directed manner. It involves the delivery&#xD;
      of a non-toxic chemical agent that selectively accumulates into target areas and the&#xD;
      subsequent exposure of the targeted tissue to relatively low-intensity ultrasound. These&#xD;
      procedures (sensitization and ultrasound exposure) are both per se harmless, but, when&#xD;
      combined, result in activation of the chemical agent and subsequent cytotoxic events limited&#xD;
      to the target tissue volume. SDT offers significant advantages because ultrasound energy can&#xD;
      be tightly focused and delivered through the intact skull to deep areas of the brain,&#xD;
      depending on the frequency. SDT is achieved by focusing low-intensity and low-frequency&#xD;
      ultrasound, which, as opposite to high-intensity ultrasonic beams, can be focused effectively&#xD;
      within the whole intracranial space with the currently available device (ExAblate 4000,&#xD;
      Insightec, Haifa, Israel). This would enable to target also tumors in the peripheral area of&#xD;
      the intracranial space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5-ALA is a protoporhyrin IX (PpIX) precursor that selectively accumulates in HGGs because of&#xD;
      an enhanced uptake and metabolism from tumor cells. It is used for intra-operative guidance&#xD;
      in surgery as tumoral tissues shows an exceeding fluorescence under certain light conditions&#xD;
      due to PpIX accumulation, as compared to the normal surrounding parenchyma. It is therefore a&#xD;
      good candidate for SDT. 5-ALA can exert sonodynamic effects against HGGs, as it has been&#xD;
      shown in several pre-clinical studies. Unpublished pre-clinical data on a safety experiment&#xD;
      conducted at the University of Virginia showed that SDT with 5-ALA was not exerting a toxic&#xD;
      effect to the normal brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The idea of the present study is to investigate the antitumor effects of SDT in patients&#xD;
      affected by HGGs attained with low-frequency focused ultrasound. Focused ultrasound under&#xD;
      MRI-guidance can be safely delivered through an intact human skull to perform SDT in&#xD;
      combination with 5-ALA with a low risk of transient adverse effects, as evaluated during&#xD;
      follow-up visits, post-procedural serial MRI and histology.&#xD;
