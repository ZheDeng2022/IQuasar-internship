      The goal of this randomized controlled trial is to investigate the effects of a dance&#xD;
      intervention performed at home, on cardiovascular risk factors and functional capacity of&#xD;
      elderly individuals with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus. Comparison will be performed&#xD;
      with a walking exercise intervention, performed outside. Dance sessions will be guided online&#xD;
      by an expertise instructor, and walking sessions will be performed at a self-selected&#xD;
      intensity, with no simultaneous supervision. All participants will complete an exercise diary&#xD;
      after each exercise session (reporting perception of subjective effort, affective responses,&#xD;
      and others).The participants will include men and women between 65 and 80 years old, with&#xD;
      body mass index inferior to 35 Kg /m2. The main outcome of this study is the peak oxygen&#xD;
      consumption (VO2peak). The secondary outcomes are cardiovascular risk associated factors&#xD;
      (C-reactive protein, TNF-alpha, lipid profile, etc) and functional performance (muscle&#xD;
      strength and power, balance, gate ability, etc). Cognitive skills (executive function and&#xD;
      memory) will be also assessed. The experimental design will include a control period of four&#xD;
      weeks, two sessions of assessments before and after the interventions, and twelve weeks of&#xD;
      dancing or walking interventions, performed three times a week, in non-consecutive days, with&#xD;
      60 min duration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aging process is characterized by a loss of lean mass simultaneously to an increase in&#xD;
      visceral adipose tissue (Bruseghini P. et al. 2015). This may result in reduced glucose&#xD;
      uptake and increased levels of pro inflammatory cytokines, which leads to a chronic low grade&#xD;
      inflammation state, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and elevated&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk (CVR) (Krause, M.S. et al. 2013). Reductions in lean mass are also&#xD;
      associated with reductions in muscle strength and power, inducing functional declines that&#xD;
      result in difficulties to perform daily activities, and eventual loss of physical&#xD;
      independence (Cadore, E.L. and Izquierdo, M. 2013) Costs with the treatment of&#xD;
      aging-associated comorbidities are elevated for the health systems (Bielemann, R.M.K. et al.&#xD;
      2010). Searching for low cost strategies of prevention, with long term results, is essential&#xD;
      then, especially the ones which may prevent dependence in a large spectrum (at the physical,&#xD;
      social and cognitive levels), such as dancing (Laddu, D.R. et al 2020). Particularly, due to&#xD;
      the pandemic of Corona Virus Disease-19 (COVID-19), long periods of self-isolation and social&#xD;
      distancing have resulted in dramatic changes in the lifestyle of this population, beyond the&#xD;
      risk of viral infection (Laddu, D.R. et al 2020). In this context, regular physical activity&#xD;
      is considered to be a preventive strategy against chronic diseases due to its beneficial&#xD;
      effects on global health (physical, mental, and social domains) (Fletcher, G.F. et.al. 2018).&#xD;
      Particularly, dancing has been suggested as a strategy to increase levels of physical&#xD;
      activity during quarantine periods (Jiménez-Pavón, D. et al. 2020), considering they can be&#xD;
      adjusted for different ages, physical limitations, and levels of previous experience&#xD;
      (Rodrigues-Krause, J.C. et al. 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the goal of this randomized controlled trial is to investigate the effects of a&#xD;
      dance intervention on cardiovascular risk factors and functional capacity of older people,&#xD;
      with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), comparing dancing to an active control&#xD;
      group of walking exercise. The participants will include men and women between 65 and 80&#xD;
      years old, with body mass index inferior to 35 Kg /m2 and independent for performing daily&#xD;
      activities. They should not be engaged in any type of regular physical activity in the past 6&#xD;
      months. Exclusion criteria will include cardiovascular complications, mobility limitations&#xD;
      and neurodegenerative diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental design will include 3 parts: 1) Pre-intervention assessments: medical&#xD;
      evaluation, fasting blood exams, maximum exercise test, assessments of body composition,&#xD;
      balance, gate ability, muscular strength and power. 2) Control Period: 4 weeks for the follow&#xD;
      up of the maintenance or changes in the primary and secondary outcomes responses of the&#xD;
      participants. Primary and secondary outcomes will be evaluated before and after the control&#xD;
      period. 3) Period of interventions: patients will be randomized in blocks&#xD;
      (randomization.com), in accordance to their VO2peak, gender, and the presence of T2DM, to one&#xD;
      of the two groups: dance or walking. The duration of the dance and walking interventions will&#xD;
      be 12 weeks, including 3 sessions per week, each lasting 60 min. performed at home, guided by&#xD;
      an expertise instructor, as live online sessions. Session will include several styles (salsa,&#xD;
      jazz, aerobics), basic technical elements, no partner required. Walking: performed as a&#xD;
      continuous aerobic exercise, outside, at a self-selected intensity, with no simultaneous&#xD;
      supervision. Both interventions will include a warm-up (10 min), main part (40 min) and&#xD;
      cool-down (10 min). All participants will complete an exercise diary after each exercise&#xD;
      session (reporting perception of subjective effort, affective responses, and others). 3)&#xD;
      Post-intervention assessments: the same protocols of testing of the pre-interventions&#xD;
      assessments will be repeated. 4) Follow-up assessments: participants will be evaluated in 12&#xD;
      weeks times, for primary and secondary outcomes, after the end of the exercise intervention&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome of this study is the peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak), as it has been&#xD;
      associated with both, cardiovascular risk and functional performance in aging individuals.&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes are: (1) cardiovascular risk associated factors: C-reactive protein,&#xD;
      TNF-alpha, triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, fasting&#xD;
      glucose and insulin, and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). (2)&#xD;
      Functional performance: muscle strength and power, balance, gate ability and muscle quality.&#xD;
      (3) Cognitive function: executive function (random number generation and trial making test).&#xD;
      In the following outcomes description of this Clinical Trials record, protocols of assessment&#xD;
      for outcomes 1 to 20 are based on Rodrigues-Krause, J.C. et al. 2018. For outcomes 21 and 22&#xD;
      the reference is Forte, R. et al. 2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will be expressed in mean and confidence interval. All the assessments will be held&#xD;
      at the Laboratory of Research in Exercise (LAPEX-UFRGS). Statistics: Generalized estimating&#xD;
      equations, followed by the post hoc of least significant difference (LSD) (p&lt;0.05).&#xD;
      Comparisons before and after the interventions will be made among groups 1=dancing, 2=dancing&#xD;
      T2DM, 3=walking, 4=walking T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the well known benefits of the exercise, it is expected that our interventions&#xD;
      will result in improvements on CVR (increases in cardiorespiratory fitness, reductions in&#xD;
      adiposity, lipemia, insulin resistance and systemic inflammation), functionality (muscle&#xD;
      strength and power, balance, gate and flexibility), and cognitive function (executive&#xD;
      function). Our results will add on knowledge regarding the magnitude of possible gains from&#xD;
      dancing at home, when compared to other forms of traditional aerobic exercise, a lack in the&#xD;
      literature so far. Finally, the application of a purpose for an intervention of low cost and&#xD;
      high levels of adherence, which stimulates multiple factors that decline with aging, may be a&#xD;
      step forward in terms of strategies of prevention of aging-associated diseases on the public&#xD;
      health context.&#xD;

    <time_frame>before intervention (week 0), after control period (week 5), and after intervention (week 13)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' VO2peak will be determined through an incremental exercise test on a treadmill. The test will start with a 5 min warm-up (from 3 to 5 km/h, increasing 0.5 km/h each min, until 5 min), followed by 2% increases in slope every min, while maintaining a constant speed of 5 km/h throughout the entire test. In order to be considered a maximum effort test, participants must attain at least two of the following criteria: (1) age-predicted HRmax, (2) respiratory exchange ratio (RER) ≥1.1, (3) subjective perception of effort ≥17 (Borg scale 6-20), (4) signals of muscle fatigue, such as loss of motor coordination. Ventilatory parameters will be measured continuously, breath-by breath, using an open-circuit spirometry system (Quark Cardio Pulmonary Exercise Test, Cosmed Italy). VO2peak was identified as the highest VO2 value in a line of tendency plotted against the time. Higher VO2peak values indicate better cardiorespiratory fitness and cardiovascular health.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Leisure Time Physical Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>before intervention (week 0), after control period (week 5), and after intervention (week 13)</time_frame>
    <description>The Godin-Shephard leisure-time physical activity questionnaire will be used in its validated version and translated into Brazilian Portuguese. Light, moderate or vigorous physical activities, performed for at least 15 min during leisure time, will be registered by the participants. The frequency is multiplied by the metabolic equivalent (MET). High scores indicate a higher level of physical activity during leisure. For example, in the reference to the score in units using only moderate and strenuous physical activities, 24 units or more means &quot;Active&quot;, indicating substantial benefits; from 14 to 23 units means &quot;Moderately active&quot;, indicating some benefits; and less than 14 units means &quot;Insufficiently active&quot;, indicating low benefits.</description>

    <measure>Change in Executive function, assessed by the Random number generation task</measure>
    <time_frame>before intervention (week 0), after control period (week 5), and after intervention (week 13)</time_frame>
    <description>The random number generation task evaluates executive functions, particularly inhibition. Briefly, participants verbally generated a random sequence of 100 numbers chosen between one and nine, at a frequency of 40 bpm, paced by a metronome. The randomness of the sequence is elaborated to obtain three indices that were theoreti¬cally related to the inhibitory function: the Turning Point Index, the Adjacency, and the Runs. High levels on the Turning Point Index, but low levels of Adjacency and Runs correspond to a high ability to inhibit the production of stereotyped strings, therefore contributing to the optimal control of complex activities.</description>

    <measure>Change in Executive function, assessed by the Trail making test</measure>
    <time_frame>[Time Frame: before intervention (week 0), after control period (week 5), and after intervention (week 13)]</time_frame>
    <description>The trail making test assesses attention, speed, and cognitive flexibility. The standard protocol used requires participants to draw lines connecting in ascending order and as quickly as possible 25 circles distributed over a sheet of paper. The test has a part A with numbers only and a part B with numbers and letters joined in alternation (i.e, 1-A-2-B-3-C, and so on). A summary score will be calculated by subtracting the time taken in seconds to complete part A from the time at part B (ΔTrail Making) and used for analysis.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the walking group will take part in a walking intervention programme for 12 weeks, including 3 sessions per week (non-consecutive days), each lasting 60 min. The walking session will include a warm up of 10 min (posture and join mobility), a main part of 40 min, and a cool down of 10 min (muscle stretching and relaxation). They will be performed individually, outside, at a self-selected intensity, with no supervision.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the dance group will take part in a dance intervention programme for 12 weeks, including 3 sessions per week (non-consecutive days), each lasting 60 min. Dance classes will be performed individually at home, guided by an expertise instructor, as live sessions online. They will include a variety of rhythms such as salsa, merengue, jazz dance, aerobics, etc. The dance sessions will include a warm up of approximately 10 min (posture, join mobility and dance technique), a main part of 40 min (practicing isolated dance moves and learning of specific choreographic routines), and a cool down of 10 min (muscle stretching and relaxation).</description>
