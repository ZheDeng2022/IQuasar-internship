  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a theory-driven&#xD;
      intervention (TRAIN concussion education) to improve parental concussion-related attitudes,&#xD;
      beliefs, intentions, confidence in knowledge, and self-efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: 180 parents of United States middle school aged children whose children have&#xD;
      been engaged in organized sports within the past 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: The study is a single-blind (participants) randomized control trial. The&#xD;
      investigators will randomize eligible parents into two groups: (1) control (standard&#xD;
      concussion education); and treatment (standard concussion education AND TRAIN concussion&#xD;
      education) to evaluate the effectiveness of the TRAIN concussion education intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A convenience sample of participants will be recruited from parents of United States middle&#xD;
      school aged children whose children have been engaged in organized sports within the past 2&#xD;
      years. Interested parents will contact study stuff, who will ensure eligibility criteria are&#xD;
      met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon this, and completing the written informed consent process, participants will be assigned&#xD;
      a unique identifier and randomized (simple) without replacement to one of the two study arms&#xD;
      (control vs. treatment), using a predetermined random number generator in Excel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the control group will receive standard concussion education materials&#xD;
      focused on concussion prevention in youth sport. Participants in the treatment group will&#xD;
      receive the same standard concussion education materials AND the TRAIN concussion education&#xD;
      module. The TRAIN education module is grounded in a theoretical structure inclusive of the&#xD;
      original intervention tenants of the Popular Opinion Leader (POL) and Diffusion of&#xD;
      Innovations frameworks, and within the context of the socioecological model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a self-administered online pre-test survey, which includes&#xD;
      assessments of concussion-related attitudes, beliefs, intentions, confidence in knowledge,&#xD;
      and self-efficacy. After completion of the pre-test survey, participants will complete their&#xD;
      assigned intervention (TRAIN concussion education module + standard concussion education&#xD;
      materials versus standard concussion education materials only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of their assigned intervention, participants will complete the online survey&#xD;
      again to obtain post-test measures (post-test survey). Participants will also be scheduled to&#xD;
      complete individual semi-structured interviews.&#xD;

    <measure>Concussion-Related Beliefs Change Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-intervention) and follow-up (post intervention approximately 7-30 days after intervention completion)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are asked 6 questions concerning beliefs related to concussion risk, symptoms, and management. These items are added together to compute an overall score. Scoring scale ranges from a minimum of 6 to a maximum 24, where a higher score indicated more favorable beliefs. A change score will be computed post score-pre score.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Concussion-Related Attitudes Change Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-intervention) and follow-up (post intervention approximately 7-30 days after intervention completion)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are asked 20 survey items identifying an individual's attitudes about a certain behavior (e.g., seeking care). Each item is added together to compute an overall attitude score. Scoring scale ranges from a minimum of 20 to a maximum of 140, where higher scores indicate more favorable attitudes. A change score will be computed post score-pre score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Confidence in Concussion-Related Knowledge Change Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-intervention) and follow-up (post intervention approximately 7-30 days after intervention completion)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are asked 2 questions concerning confidence in knowing and recognizing concussion symptoms. These items are added together to compute an overall score. Scoring scale ranges from a minimum of 2 to a maximum 8, where a higher score indicated better confidence in concussion knowledge. A change score will be computed post score-pre score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Concussion-Related Intentions Change Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-intervention) and follow-up (post intervention approximately 7-30 days after intervention completion)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are asked 4 questions assessing intention to engage in or talk with others about concussion prevention. The items are totaled to compute an overall behavioral intention score. Scoring scale ranges from a minimum of 4 to a maximum of 16, where a higher score indicates a better likelihood to engage in favorable behaviors related to concussion prevention. A change score will be computed post score-pre score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Concussion-Related Self-Efficacy Change Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-intervention) and follow-up (post intervention approximately 7-30 days after intervention completion)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are asked 8 questions assessing their self-efficacy regarding engaging in or talking with others about concussion prevention. The items are totaled to compute an overall self-efficacy score. Scoring scale ranges from a minimum of 8 to a maximum of 32, where a higher score indicates higher self-efficacy. A change score will be computed post score-pre score.</description>
