  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims to establish that treatment with near infrared light (NIR) reduces&#xD;
      cystic macular oedema in patients with a retinal vein occlusion.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intraocular injections of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) inhibitors have been&#xD;
      shown to improve swelling of central retina (macular oedema) and vision in patients with&#xD;
      retinal vein occlusions (RVO), however this treatment comes with potentially sight&#xD;
      threatening risks. A less invasive treatment might have many advantages. We recently showed&#xD;
      that eyes with macular oedema caused by diabetes, the other main cause of macular oedema, who&#xD;
      received treatment with near-infrared (NIR) light was not only safe but was also effective in&#xD;
      reducing the swelling. The US Diabetic Retinopathy Research Collaboration are currently&#xD;
      recruiting for a larger study of NIR light which may or may not confirm our findings. We&#xD;
      propose to test the safety and efficacy of the same NIR light in patients with macular oedema&#xD;
      from retinal vein occlusions. We anticipate this may reduce the need for injections of VEGF&#xD;
      inhibitors in eyes with RVO, in particular eyes with good vision. This pilot study will help&#xD;
      determine whether PBM with NIR for RVO warrants further investigation in a larger study.&#xD;

    <description>Each NIR light treatment will consist of a 90 second exposure of the macula of the study eye to the Ellex Integre NIR laser with the patient fixating on the central aiming beam. The laser light beam is 4.5mm in diameter with a central masked area of 1.0 mm diameter containing the central fixation target. In this way the central macula will be spared in the event of an adverse effect of the laser, which we do not anticipate.&#xD;
The patient will be seated at the slit lamp laser delivery system and after the eye has been dilated and anesthetised with topical eye drops a standard fundus contact lens will be placed on the eye through which the post area pole will be visualised while the treatment is delivered. There will be 12 treatments administered over a 5 week period.</description>
