  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a retrospective, multinational, non-interventional observational study. The&#xD;
      study does not attempt to test any specific a priori hypothesis; it is descriptive only and&#xD;
      will collect data under conditions of routine medical care. Relevant secondary databases will&#xD;
      be identified, and a series of cohort studies will be conducted to assess the prevalence of&#xD;
      undiagnosed CKD. The study will also assess the current state of CKD management in patients&#xD;
      with undiagnosed CKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Estimate the point prevalence of undiagnosed stage 3 CKD (proportion of patients with&#xD;
           eGFR measurements indicating stage 3 CKD with no corresponding CKD diagnostic code&#xD;
           either before or up to six months after the second abnormal eGFR value)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Describe time to CKD diagnosis in patients with no prior CKD diagnosis code at index&#xD;
           date (time of second qualifying eGFR), overall and by patient characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess trends in the prevalence (point prevalence) of undiagnosed CKD by calendar year&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Describe baseline characteristics among those with undiagnosed versus diagnosed CKD&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess CKD management and monitoring practices (post index date) in patients with&#xD;
           diagnosed versus undiagnosed CKD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives (pending feasibility)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Describe the risk of selected adverse clinical outcomes longitudinally among those with&#xD;
           undiagnosed versus diagnosed CKD&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Describe HCRU associated with undiagnosed versus diagnosed CKD&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess association between the timing of the CKD diagnosis and the risk of selected&#xD;
           adverse clinical outcomes and HCRU in patients with no CKD diagnosis code prior to the&#xD;
           index date&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Describe health care costs associated with undiagnosed versus diagnosed CKD&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. For CKD patients with eGFR 25-75 mL/min/1.73m2 and urine albumin creatinine ratio (UACR)&#xD;
           200 - 5000 mg/g (DAPA-CKD trial-like population):&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Estimate the point prevalence of undiagnosed CKD&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Describe the risk of selected adverse clinical outcomes longitudinally among those&#xD;
                with undiagnosed CKD&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Describe HCRU and costs associated with undiagnosed CKD&#xD;
