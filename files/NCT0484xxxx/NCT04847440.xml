  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multi center, dose ranging study of&#xD;
      safety and efficacy in both volunteers with chronic hepatitis B virus infection and in&#xD;
      volunteers with hepatitis D virus coinfection. Volunteers will be administered multiple oral&#xD;
      doses of ATI-2173 and assessed for safety and efficacy including blood tests to show how the&#xD;
      body metabolizes and eliminates the investigational drug as well as how the drug effects the&#xD;
      virus infection.&#xD;
