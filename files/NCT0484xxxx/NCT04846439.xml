  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alloimmune-mediated platelet transfusion refractoriness(PTR) was usually caused by repeated&#xD;
      blood transfusions and pregnancy and accounts for about 20-25% of PTR patients. Patients with&#xD;
      acute leukemia need repeated platelet infusion in myelosuppression period after chemotherapy,&#xD;
      and PTR incidence is more higher.PTR was associated with adverse events,including longer&#xD;
      hospital stays,severe hemorrhages and an increased risk of early deaths and may have a&#xD;
      negative impact on the success of HSCT. The current management of patients with PTR includes&#xD;
      specific transfusion strategies, IVIG, rituximab,thrombopoietin-receptor agonists(TPO-RA)&#xD;
      ,bortezomib or splenectomy,have been largely unsatisfactory. As we know, HLA antibodies are&#xD;
      mainly secreted by the plasma cells. Researchers want to see if sequential infusion of CD19&#xD;
      and BCMA CAR-T cells can clear the B cells and plasma cells, can help increase platelet&#xD;
      levels and reduce bleeding in patients with platelet transfusion refractoriness. To see if&#xD;
      sequential infusion can increases platelet levels more after a transfusion. To see if it&#xD;
      reduces the chance of bleeding. Adults 16-65 years old who diagnosed with acute leukemia in&#xD;
      CR and alloimmune platelet transfusion refractoriness.&#xD;
