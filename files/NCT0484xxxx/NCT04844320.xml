  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity has become an increasingly common health problem today. In this context, although&#xD;
      many anatomical, physiological and metabolic problems arising from obesity in morbid obese&#xD;
      patients are tried to be solved in daily practice, it has been proven that eliminating&#xD;
      obesity is sufficient in the treatment of many diseases. When we look at the literature, it&#xD;
      is known that morbid obesity causes deformation and excessive wear in most body joints. When&#xD;
      morbid obesity disappears, it has been shown that the previously existing neck, waist, back&#xD;
      and knee pains regress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to reveal the Cobb angle change in morbidly obese patients who&#xD;
      achieved rapid weight loss after obesity surgery; To investigate the effect of weight loss on&#xD;
      vertebral anatomy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      90 morbidly obese patients who underwent Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy were included in the&#xD;
      study. Cobb angle measurements were made by a radiologist included in the study from the PA&#xD;
      chest radiographs of the operated patients in the preoperative period and in the first&#xD;
      postoperative year, and they were recorded in a previously prepared database. In addition, in&#xD;
      the preoperative period and postoperative first year evaluations of the patients; Patient&#xD;
      satisfaction questionnaire in terms of low back pain, back pain, neck pain, and the value in%&#xD;
      EWL of weight given after surgery were also recorded in the database.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study was designed to include 3 groups of 30 patients and a total of 90 patients. 90 patients who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy will be divided into 3 groups according to their postoperative weight gain. The first group will include patients who have lost more than 50% EWL postoperative weight, the second group will include patients who have lost 50 to 25% EWL postoperative , and the third group will include patients who have lost less than 25% EWL postoperative.&#xD;
Patients in these 3 groups will be randomized on www.randomisor.org. In these 3 groups, cobb angle measurements will be made on the PA chest radiographs taken at the preoperative, postoperative 1st year and postoperative 2nd year controls. Patient satisfaction questionnaires will be conducted to compare pre- and postoperative complaints such as low back pain, back pain, and neck pain in all patients. The change in cobb angles will be determined according to the weight loss ratio (% EWL) of the patients.</intervention_model_description>
