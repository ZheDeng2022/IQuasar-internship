  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in CLUE Comfort</measure>
    <time_frame>At 2-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective overall vision and comfort scores will be assessed using Contact Lens User Experience (CLUE) questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes questionnaire to assess patient-experience attributes of soft, disposable contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Scores follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response. A 5-point increase in an average CLUE score translates into 10% shift in the distribution of scores for population of soft disposable contact lens wearers. A higher CLUE score indicates better comfort with respect to contact lens wear. The change is calculated as 2-week minus Baseline. The average change in CLUE Comfort for each arm will be reported.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in CLDEQ-8</measure>
    <time_frame>At 2-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The CLDEQ-8 is a validated outcome measure for soft contact lenses wearers. It has been highly correlated with habitual baseline status and change in overall opinion when subjects are refit with contact lenses. A CLDEQ-8 total score of ≥12 is proposed to identify contact lens wearers who could benefit from clinical management of their contact lens related symptoms. A three points change in CLDEQ-8 total scores has also been shown to be clinically important. This study will include the symptomatic subjects who will have a CLDEQ total score of ≥15. A higher CLDEQ-8 score indicates more dry eye symptoms with respect to contact lens wear. The change is calculated as 2-week minus Baseline. The average change in CLDEQ-8 for each arm will be reported.</description>
