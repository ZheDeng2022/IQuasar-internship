    <textblock>
      The serotonin (5-HT) and oxytocin releaser and so-called &quot;empathogen&quot;&#xD;
      3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) acutely produces positive feelings, empathy, and&#xD;
      trust. MDMA is used recreationally (ecstasy), as research tool to study 5-HT and oxytocin&#xD;
      function, and is investigated for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MDMA is metabolized in part (10%) to the psychoactive metabolite&#xD;
      3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) which itself is also a recreational substance and has&#xD;
      also been used to assist psychotherapy in the past. The present study aims to describe and&#xD;
      directly compare for the first time the effects of MDMA and MDA in the same healthy&#xD;
      volunteers and using modern psychological and psychometric tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, although amphetamines including MDMA and MDA induce mainly positive subjective&#xD;
      effects they may also produce negative subjective drug effects including anxiety in&#xD;
      particular at the onset of the subjective response and the rapid onset of euphoria may&#xD;
      increase the risk of abuse. Additionally, blood pressure may increase rapidly at drug onset.&#xD;
      A possible solution to mitigate anxiety, abuse-related rapid euphoria increases and/or rapid&#xD;
      blood pressure changes at onset consist of slowing the onset of the drug effect by using a&#xD;
      slow-release formulation of MDMA. In the present study, the investigators will characterize&#xD;
      the effects of lysine-MDMA and lysine-MDA and compare their effects with MDMA/MDA to test the&#xD;
      concept of attenuated effects across both substances.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is used as recreational substance (Ecstasy),&#xD;
      research tool to stimulate serotonin (5-HT) and oxytocin release and study associated mood&#xD;
      states, and as a potential therapeutic substance to enhance psychotherapy for post-traumatic&#xD;
      stress disorder. MDMA is an amphetamine derivative which, unlike prototypical amphetamines,&#xD;
      predominantly enhances serotonergic neurotransmission via release of 5-HT through the SERT&#xD;
      and it less potently also releases dopamine and norepinephrine through the DA transporter and&#xD;
      NE transporter, respectively. Furthermore, MDMA is known to trigger oxytocin release which&#xD;
      may contribute to its effects to increase trust, prosociality, and enhance empathy. MDMA is&#xD;
      therefore referred to as an &quot;entactogen&quot; or &quot;empathogen&quot;. MDMA is currently the only&#xD;
      empathogen investigated in substance-assisted psychotherapy but other substances including&#xD;
      the MDMA-metabolite 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) have been used in the past or may be&#xD;
      used in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: MDA may exert greater perceptual psychedelic-like effects due to a more potent binding&#xD;
      to the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, and it may also act longer than MDMA partly due to a longer&#xD;
      plasma half-life. However, effects of MDMA and MDA have never been compared directly in the&#xD;
      same study in humans and there is only one modern study that characterized MDA in humans.&#xD;
      Therefore, the present study aims to describe and directly compare for the first time the&#xD;
      effects of MDMA and MDA in the same healthy volunteers using modern and sensitive&#xD;
      psychological and psychometric tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Additionally, although amphetamines including MDMA and MDA induce mainly positive&#xD;
      subjective effects they may also produce negative subjective drug effects including anxiety&#xD;
      in particular at the onset of the subjective response and the rapid onset of euphoria may&#xD;
      increase abuse liability. Additionally, blood pressure may increase rapidly at drug onset. A&#xD;
      possible solution to mitigate anxiety, abuse-related rapid euphoria increases and/or rapid&#xD;
      blood pressure changes at onset consist of slowing the onset of the drug effect by using a&#xD;
      slow-release formulation of MDMA/MDA. Alternatively, amphetamines can be linked to the&#xD;
      endogenous amino acid lysine forming inactive lysine-amphetamine which then liberates the&#xD;
      active amphetamine slowly in the circulation via plasma peptidases. This approach has been&#xD;
      implemented with the medication Lisdexamfetamine, which combines lysine with d-amphetamine.&#xD;
      In the present study, the investigators will similarly characterize the effects of&#xD;
      lysine-MDMA and lysine-MDA to test for attenuated effects across both substances in&#xD;
      comparison with MDMA/MDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a two-factorial study design with four active substance conditions (MDMA vs. MDA and&#xD;
      lysine-MDMA vs. lysine-MDA) the investigators will be able to test differences between MDMA&#xD;
      and MDA (with and without lysine) as well as between lysinated a non-lysinated substance&#xD;
      (regardless of active substance) in the same study and with high statistical power and within&#xD;
      one study addressing two aims.&#xD;
