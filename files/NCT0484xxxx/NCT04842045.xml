  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the RECAP Study Program is to investigate the role played by&#xD;
      conscious experience in the antidepressant effects of the psychedelic agent psilocybin. This&#xD;
      pilot dosing study (PILOT RECAP) is designed to determine the optimal dose of midazolam that&#xD;
      allows a psychedelic experience to occur while inducing amnesia for the experience. This is&#xD;
      an essential step required for subsequent evaluation of the role of memory for the&#xD;
      psychedelic experience in the antidepressant effects of psilocybin in the full RECAP study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PILOT RECAP Study will investigate the effect of co- administering the amnestic agent&#xD;
      midazolam with a single 25 mg dose of psilocybin on the induction of a psychedelic experience&#xD;
      and subsequent memory for the experience with the goal of identifying an optimal dosing&#xD;
      regimen of midazolam that will allow a psychedelic experience to occur while also inducing&#xD;
      amnesia for the experience. Identifying this midazolam dosing regimen will allow us in a&#xD;
      subsequent stage of the RECAP program to test whether memory for the psychedelic experience&#xD;
      is required/important for psilocybin to produce longer-term antidepressant effects. This is a&#xD;
      phase 1 study in psychiatrically and medically healthy volunteers. Given this, there is no&#xD;
      disease background for PILOT RECAP per se. However, the purpose of PILOT RECAP is to identify&#xD;
      an optimal midazolam dosing schedule to be used in a subsequent study (RECAP) in patients&#xD;
      with major depressive disorder (MDD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational treatment for PILOT RECAP is a single 25 mg dose of psilocybin combined&#xD;
      with repeated intravenous (IV) boluses of midazolam dosed at levels known to maintain&#xD;
      conscious experience while inducing subsequent amnesia for the experience upon its&#xD;
      conclusion. Because PILOT RECAP is the first study to examine this drug combination, no data&#xD;
      are currently available on this approach. Psilocybin + midazolam will be administered within&#xD;
      a &quot;Set and Setting&quot; (SaS) protocol that provides psychoeducation and therapeutic support&#xD;
      prior to, during, and following psychedelic dosing, and that has been standard procedure for&#xD;
      recent studies of psilocybin in humans. It is believed that this SaS approach enhances&#xD;
      clinical efficacy and safety. SaS is an integral component of the PILOT RECAP intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PILOT RECAP study will not enroll vulnerable populations. During this study, participants&#xD;
      are asked to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Refrain from use of psychotropic medications. Use of such medications prior to&#xD;
           psilocybin/midazolam dosing will result in a participant being discontinued from the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Refrain from use of any illegal psychoactive substances from screening until study&#xD;
           termination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Refrain from using legal psychoactive substance for the following defined time periods&#xD;
           (the exception is caffeine):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Tobacco and Nicotine: from screening until study termination&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Alcohol: 72 hours prior to the Dosing Visit&#xD;

    <time_frame>On Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete a selection of several questions from the ASC questionnaire that strongly associate positively or negatively with later antidepressant effect of psilocybin in patients with treatment resistant depression or capture classic features of the psychedelic experience.&#xD;
During the dosing session, investigator will repeatedly ask 5 selected items from the ASC scale to get a &quot;real time&quot; measure of what the participants are experiencing. Each of these items will be scored separately. Higher score are indicative of a more intense psychedelic experience.</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <measure>Number of participants scoring &lt; 50 percent on post-dosing Day 1 of the mean normative score of ASC data from prior patients with treatment resistant depression administered the ASC questionnaire post-dosing</measure>
    <time_frame>On Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the degree to which midazolam has induced amnesia for the psychedelic experience, participants will complete the full ASC.&#xD;
The ASC is a 94 item questionaire. In response to each item, participants are asked to mark their experience somewhere between 'No, not more than usual' to 'Yes, much more than usual'. Normal waking consciousness corresponds to a mark at the very left end of the scale, i.e. 'No, Not more than usual'.&#xD;
Responses marked more towards right side of the range are considered high on psychedelic experience.</description>

    <description>The psilocybin used in this study is synthetically manufactured in a laboratory and meets quality specifications suitable for human research use. The active drug is encapsulated using a hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) capsule and contains 25 mg of psilocybin.&#xD;
The midazolam in this study will be administered intravenously. The total dose administered to subjects is dependent on the individual's level of amnesia, sedation scale,score and age and weight. For participants who remember ≥ 25% of the words (insufficient amnesia), midazolam dose will be increased to the high dose schedule. In terms of sedation, for participants who are overly sedated (OAA/S &lt;4), the midazolam dose will be decreased to the low dose schedule. In situations in which the participant demonstrates amnesia but over-sedation, the low-dose schedule will be employed to increase the likelihood that a full psychedelic experience will occur.</description>
