  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The factors of success of decannulation are not well known in the literature and the decision&#xD;
      to decannulate is mainly based on clinical judgment. The failure rate of decannulation is&#xD;
      between 2 and 25% with a poor prognosis in case of failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to determine the factors associated with successful&#xD;
      tracheostomy removal in patients hospitalized in a respiratory weaning unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to evaluate in tracheostomized and hospitalized patients in&#xD;
      weaning unit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The prevalence of successful tracheostomy removal;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The prevalence of successful weaning from mechanical ventilation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Factors associated with successful weaning from mechanical ventilation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic characteristics of these patients at admission;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ventilatory characteristics of these patients at admission;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biological characteristics of these patients at admission;&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, single-centre, interventional cohort study with an expected duration&#xD;
      of 2 years. All patients admitted to the respiratory weaning unit in the Forcilles' hospital,&#xD;
      with a tracheostomy and an expected duration of mechanical ventilation &gt; 48 hours will be&#xD;
      consecutively included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All factors potentially associated with successful tracheostomy removal will be prospectively&#xD;
      collected: severity factors related to the ICU stay, ventilatory factors, respiratory and&#xD;
      extra-respiratory factors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      1. Rational Mechanical ventilation following tracheal intubation is a common life-support&#xD;
           procedure to treat patients with acute respiratory failure. However, even if the acute&#xD;
           event is resolved, the ICU length of stay may be prolonged by prolonged mechanical&#xD;
           ventilation. Many factors contribute to prolonging mechanical ventilation and prevent&#xD;
           progression in weaning from the ventilator: neuromuscular blocking agents, pulmonary&#xD;
           infections, pre-existing respiratory disease, etc. In case of prolonged invasive&#xD;
           ventilation, following several failures of weaning and re-intubation, these patients are&#xD;
           therefore most often tracheostomy by percutaneous or surgical way in order to optimise&#xD;
           the mechanical ventilation weaning strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The weaning units, initially created in the United States and then in France in the&#xD;
           early 2000s, have improved the success rate of mechanical ventilation weaning in these&#xD;
           difficult-to-wean patients. The factors associated with the success of decannulation are&#xD;
           not well known in the literature and the decision to remove the tracheostomy is&#xD;
           primarily based on the clinical impression. The rate of tracheostomy removal failure&#xD;
           ranges from 2 to 25%, with a poor prognosis in case of failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypothesis The severity of the critical care patient, the factors related to mechanical&#xD;
           ventilation, the respiratory and extra-respiratory status are independent factors for&#xD;
           successful decannulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Main objective Determine the factors associated with successful tracheostomy removal in&#xD;
           difficult-to-wean patients hospitalised in respiratory weaning unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
           The secondary objectives are to evaluate in tracheostomy and hospitalised patients in&#xD;
           weaning unit:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The prevalence of successful tracheostomy removal;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The prevalence of successful weaning from mechanical ventilation;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The factors associated with successful weaning from mechanical ventilation;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Demographic characteristics of these patients at admission;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Respiratory characteristics of these patients at admission;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Biological characteristics of these patients at admission;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Method This is a prospective, single-centre, interventional cohort study with an&#xD;
           expected duration of 2 years. This study will be performed per the ethical standards of&#xD;
           the Declaration of Helsinki and will be reported according to the Strengthening the&#xD;
           Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All patients admitted to the respiratory weaning unit in the Forcilles' hospital, with a&#xD;
           tracheostomy and an expected duration of mechanical ventilation &gt; 48 hours will be&#xD;
           consecutively included.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data will be recorded using a local case report form by the investigator. Demographic&#xD;
           data, comorbidities and medical and surgical history, biological findings, the&#xD;
           ventilatory parameters and the nutritional state will be recorded at inclusion. All&#xD;
           factors potentially associated with successful tracheostomy removal will be&#xD;
           prospectively collected: severity factors related to the ICU stay, ventilatory factors,&#xD;
           respiratory and extra-respiratory factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
           On-site monitoring is planned every month.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Statistical plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be expressed as the mean (± standard deviation) and compared using&#xD;
      the Student's t test if the null hypothesis is not rejected by the Shapiro-Wilk test.&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be expressed as the median (interquartile range) and compared with&#xD;
      the Mann-Whitney U or Kruskal-Wallis test if the null hypothesis is rejected by the&#xD;
      Shapiro-Wilk test. For categorical variables, the proportions of patients in each category&#xD;
      will be calculated. Then the groups will be compared using Chi squared test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multivariate logistic regression model will be carried out to assess the relation between&#xD;
      decannulation success and variables associated in univariate analyses. All statistically&#xD;
      significant variables will be included in the model. Variable selection will be stepwise,&#xD;
      based on Akaike Information Criterion. To check multicollinearity between independent&#xD;
      variables, the variance inflation factor will be calculated before performing multivariate&#xD;
      logistic regression. Multicollinearity will be regarded as present when the variance&#xD;
      inflation factor is &gt; 5. Goodness of fit will be assessed by Hosmer-Lemeshow method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all tests, a p-value ≤ 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. All statistical&#xD;
      analysis will be made using R software (version 3.6.1, www.R-project.org).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators based the sample size calculation on the number of independent variables&#xD;
      which will be included in the logistic multivariable regression model. The investigators use&#xD;
      the criterion of one variable per 10 events for binary logistic regression analysis. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to include the 5 most relevant ultrasound measures in the model. As&#xD;
      prevalence of tracheostomy success in our unit is estimated at 0.5, the investigators plan a&#xD;
      sample size of 100 patients.&#xD;
