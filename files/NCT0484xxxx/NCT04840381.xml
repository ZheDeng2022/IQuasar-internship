      The &quot;CenTEnari&quot; study is a cross-sectional study aiming at suveying the dietary and lifestyle&#xD;
      habits of nonagenarians and centenarianss of citizens of the Abruzzo region, Italy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several epidemiological studies indicates that diet and physical activity are two pivotal&#xD;
      pillars for the maintenance the of the health status and for longevity. These two last&#xD;
      factors seem to be strictly linked between them, as demonstrated by some studies on the so&#xD;
      called &quot;Blue zones&quot;, particular lands in the planet where longevity rate - in terms of&#xD;
      nonagenarians and centenarians - is particularly high. In these studies, it has been pointed&#xD;
      out that, other than genetics, individuals following dietary regimens with lower consumption&#xD;
      of available carbohydrates and processed foods, higher consumption of fruit, vegetables,&#xD;
      cereals and pulses and moderate intake of meat, fish and dairy foods live longer and in a&#xD;
      healthier status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Abruzzo region is characterized by a great gastronomical variability, due also to the&#xD;
      particular geographical characterization, with a few kilometer distance between sea and&#xD;
      mountains. However, most of these dietary habits tend to stick in a valuable way to&#xD;
      Mediterranean Diet, a dietary regimen listed in 2010 in the Representative List of the&#xD;
      Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO. Intriguingly, the Mediterranean Diet is&#xD;
      based on the intake of the above mentioned food groups, plus a recognized key role of the&#xD;
      physical activity and conviviality in the meal consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Particularly, in the internal and mountainous part of the Abruzzo region, it has been found&#xD;
      that the local citizens followed/follows a typical &quot;dietary practice&quot; called &quot;sdijuno&quot;, which&#xD;
      in local dialect means &quot;to break the fasting of the night&quot;. In fact, &quot;sdijuno&quot; was the first&#xD;
      abundant meal of the day - usually at mid-morning, based on the local vegetable-based foods -&#xD;
      following the previous frugal dinner and breakfast meals. Thus, it can be hypothesized of&#xD;
      14-16 hours of almost fasting period. This evidence falls into the most recent findings&#xD;
      showing the importance to consume meals in the middle part of the day and limiting the&#xD;
      caloric intake during evening time, when metabolism tends to decrease according to body&#xD;
      circadian rhythm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these premises, the aim of the present study is to survey the dietary habits of&#xD;
      nonagenarians and centenarians of the Abruzzo region - particularly focusing on their&#xD;
      adherence to &quot;sdijuno&quot; practice - as well as physical activity and to collect personal data&#xD;
      and health status information. Then, it will be investigated whether the adherence to the&#xD;
      &quot;sdijuno&quot; dietary practice is relevant among the nonagenarians and centenarians and there is&#xD;
      a link between this practice and the longevity of the volunteers. To do this, an ad hoc&#xD;
      questionnaire has been set-up and will be administered to register food frequency and meal&#xD;
      time, main recipes, physical activity habits, health status.&#xD;
