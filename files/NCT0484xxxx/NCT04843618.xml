      pressure ulcers are defined as localized damage to the skin as well as underlying soft&#xD;
      tissue, usually occuring over a bony prominence or to medical devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      immobility and friction are important risk factors for pressure ulcers, Malnutrition and body&#xD;
      mass index are associated with pressure injury prevalence, the days in hospital, skin&#xD;
      moisture and other neurological factors are significant risk factors for pressure ulcer&#xD;
      development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beni-Suef is one of the upper Egypt governorates located about 120 Km south of cairo,&#xD;
      according to population estimates from 2019, the majority of residents in the governorate&#xD;
      live in rural areas, with an urbanization rate of only 23.2%, Due to greater reliance on&#xD;
      federal and state payers, low volume and complxity of services provided, rural residents&#xD;
      often encounter barriers to healthcare that limit their ability to obtain the care they need&#xD;
