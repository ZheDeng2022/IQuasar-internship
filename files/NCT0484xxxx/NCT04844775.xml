  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EHVA P01 is an international, phase I, prophylactic HIV vaccine trial to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and immunogenicity of HIV Clade C DREP alone and in Combination with a Clade C ENV protein in&#xD;
      healthy HIV-uninfected adults.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is looking at the use of a new vaccine against the HIV virus. There are two parts&#xD;
      to the study. One part is open-label to assess the safety of this vaccine, since this will be&#xD;
      the first time that it has been used in humans. The second part is to see how well, and for&#xD;
      how long, the vaccine activates the immune system. But this trial is not looking at whether&#xD;
      or not the vaccine is effective in terms of protection against HIV. It is just assessing&#xD;
      whether and how well the immune system responds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since this is the first time the vaccine has been used in humans, the safety will be assessed&#xD;
      initially in healthy young adults. 10 participants aged 18-55 years will be given one of two&#xD;
      different doses (0.2 and 1.0 mg) by injection into the arm muscle. There will be careful&#xD;
      monitoring for any reactions to the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As long as there are no safety concerns, the second part of the study can then be started.&#xD;
      This will see how well the immune system has been activated using different dose levels of&#xD;
      the vaccine. About 60 participants aged 18-55 years will be given one of three doses&#xD;
      schedules (0.2mg, 1.0mg of the new vaccine and 4.0mg of a conventional vaccine). Chance will&#xD;
      determine which dose each individual is given. Participants are only blind to the dose of&#xD;
      vaccine administered but laboratory technicians assessing the safety parameters and immune&#xD;
      responses will be blinded. The vaccine is given by injection into the muscle of the upper&#xD;
      arm. Two injections, four weeks apart, are needed for the first part of the trial. There are&#xD;
      three vaccinations in part two of the trial. There are likely to be mild side-effects near to&#xD;
      the injection site. There may also be more general side-effects such as headache, temperature&#xD;
      and chills. Participants will be asked to record any symptoms in an online diary. In order to&#xD;
      see how well the immune system is responding, participants will need to give blood samples at&#xD;
      several time points. The vaccines are not made from HIV and cannot cause HIV infection.&#xD;
      However, the vaccines are likely to cause participants to produce antibodies against HIV that&#xD;
      are detected by the rapid HIV antibody tests that are used in routine testing and a test that&#xD;
      detects and measures antibodies in the blood used for confirmation. It is recommended that&#xD;
      participants have an up to date vaccination status for any required immunisations including&#xD;
      authorised COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccination with licensed (including authorised COVID-19)&#xD;
      vaccines should be avoided from 28 days before and after each injection .&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent steering committee will regularly review the information on safety and look at&#xD;
      the immune responses to see which dose of the candidate vaccine could go forward to&#xD;
      effectiveness testing in future trials. Before this study can start, the protocol describing&#xD;
      the procedures and information to be provided to volunteers will be reviewed by the national&#xD;
      drug authority and a multi-centre research ethics committee in the participating countries.&#xD;

    <description>Drep-HIV-PT1 The DREP-HIV-PT1 is a vaccine designed to elicit an immune response against human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and prevent infection by HIV-1 and/or disease caused by HIV-1. It is an alphavirus-based DNA replicon in which the sequences coding for the viral capsid and envelope have been replaced by the sequences encoding HIV-1 gp140 (96ZM651) antigen.&#xD;
CN54gp140+MPLA-L. Recombinant CN54gp140 is a HIV-1 envelope protein from the clade C strain 97/CN/54 isolate, which comprises a sequence of 634 amino acids. MPLA is a non-toxic version of LipoPolySaccharide (LPS), which is isolated from the LPS lipid A region of Salmonella Minnesota R595 and retains the immune-stimulatory properties of LPS, but exhibits low toxicity.</description>
