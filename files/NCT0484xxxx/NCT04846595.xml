  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV infection in France has become a chronic disease and treatment has allowed patients to&#xD;
      increase their life expectancy. However, these promising results suffer from a very large&#xD;
      variability within the socio-epidemiological subgroups, and life expectancy at 20 years of&#xD;
      age is still one third lower than in the general population. Few studies of metropolitan&#xD;
      cohorts investigated precariousness as an independent risk factor for mortality. The&#xD;
      investigators chose to consider the vulnerability of people living with HIV (PLWHA) through&#xD;
      the measurement of a validated French quantitative score, called EPICES (&quot;Évaluation de la&#xD;
      précarité et des inégalités de santé dans les centres d'examens de santé &quot;, Evaluation of&#xD;
      precariousness and health inequalities in health examination centers).&#xD;

      self-administered questionnaire administered during an annual follow-up visit to an&#xD;
      infectious disease specialist, the investigators seek to define in the alpine arc region in&#xD;
      france, socio-demographic data associated with greater precariousness among PLWHA.&#xD;
