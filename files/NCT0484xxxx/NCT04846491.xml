  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current clinical practices has shown promising prospects of the therapy strategy of&#xD;
      interferon combined with nucleos(t)ides in patients with chronic hepatitis B, but the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy has not been fully studied. This study is aimed to exploit the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of the study drug, Peginterferon alfa-2b injection, with nucleos(t)ide (NAs),&#xD;
      tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets (TDF), in the patients with hepatitis B, who has&#xD;
      previously treated with nucleos(t)ides and who are treatment naïve.&#xD;
