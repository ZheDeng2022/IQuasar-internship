  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of aromatherapy on reducing pain&#xD;
      in the acute care setting at Parkland Health and Hospital System. The target population for&#xD;
      this study will be patients who are recovering from surgical procedures and are in the&#xD;
      Surgical Services inpatient units.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the impact of aromatherapy on the administration of opioid pain&#xD;
      medication administration among the inpatient Surgical Services population. Patients from&#xD;
      multiple units (burns, trauma, plastics, general surgery, and orthopedics) will be included.&#xD;
      The study duration will be six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Lavender-Sandalwood scented aromatherapy sticker has been selected for this study because&#xD;
      it helps promote relaxation, comfort, and sleep. After introducing the patient to the study&#xD;
      and obtaining informed consent for participation, the sticker will be placed on the patient&#xD;
      gown. The sticker aroma last for twelve (12) hours and can be replaced upon patient request.&#xD;
      The sticker will be used for 72 hours after the surgical procedure and initiated during&#xD;
      patient's hospital stay. After use of aromatherapy sticker, the patient will participate in a&#xD;
      survey to evaluate their experience with the sticker. In addition, opioid pain medication&#xD;
      administration will be collected along with demographic and relevant clinical information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The historical control group will be comprised of hospitalized patients from the previous&#xD;
      year with the dame time period, demographic characteristics, service line, and relevant&#xD;
      clinical information. Other methods for establishing a control group (a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial or concurrent case control study) are not feasible due to the potential impact of the&#xD;
      aromatherapy on all patients in close proximity to the enrolled patient. The historical&#xD;
      control cohort will also allow to collect non-COVID time period data to avoid any bias due to&#xD;
      the pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint for this study is a decrease in the percentage of study patients who are&#xD;
      in the pain scale threshold from 7-10 requiring opioid pain medication administration 72&#xD;
      hours after surgery/intervention. The pain score will be recorded for each patient before&#xD;
      opioid pain medication administration within the time period. The historical control group&#xD;
      will be from the same precious year time frame to control for any seasonal bias. The first&#xD;
      dose or baseline pain score will be collected for each group and other relevant pain scores&#xD;
      within the 72-hour time period after surgery. Demographic and other clinically relevant&#xD;
      information will be compared between study and historical control group to account for any&#xD;
      differences in the primary and secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will be collected from the electronic medical record (pain scores, opioid pain&#xD;
      medication administration, and length of stay by service line. Qualitative measures of&#xD;
      aromatherapy effectiveness will be obtained through patient surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to be extracted for the active current group and the historical matched control group&#xD;
      include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient demographics (matching variable list)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Age (18-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, &gt;70.&#xD;

             -  Gender&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Race/ethnicity&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  High blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Other clinical co-morbidities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical history&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Opioid pain medication administration given for 72 hours after surgery or&#xD;
                intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Surgical Service Units: burns, trauma, plastics, general surgery, orthopedics&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Dates of admission and discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Length of stay&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Date and type of surgery/intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All Pain scores within 72 hours after surgery or intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to be extracted for the current active group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dates of aromatherapy application (possible 6 doses within 72-hour time period)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient survey forms&#xD;
