      The main aim of the current study is to investigate the effects of Low-level Laser Therapy on&#xD;
      exercise-induced muscle damage of wrist flexors in untrained young adults. A randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial will be conducted at Sargodha Medical College, University of Sargodha. The&#xD;
      sample size calculated is 16. The participants will be divided into two equal group; 1)&#xD;
      Interventional group (Low level laser therapy), 2) Control group (conventional) each having 8&#xD;
      participants. The study duration will be six months after approval from Research board.&#xD;
      Blocked randomization sampling technique will be used. The subjects will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to any of the interventional or control group. Interventional group will further be allocated&#xD;
      to prophylactic or therapeutic group. Only Un-trained young Adults, Aged 19-25&#xD;
      (under-graduate/college and university students) without gender discrimination will be&#xD;
      included in the study. Tools used in the study will be TALAG Scale (Soreness assessment),&#xD;
      Goniometer (ROM), Algometer (Pressure¬-pain Threshold), Electronic digital hand Dynamometer&#xD;
      (Grip Strength) and PRS (Perceived Recovery Status Scale). Data will be collected at&#xD;
      baseline, 1hr, 24hr, 72hr, 96hr, 120hr, 148hr, 168hr and 192 hrs after the induction&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Wrist flexors play a crucial role in hand function. This group of small muscles is of high&#xD;
      importance in our day to day tasks like carrying heavy objects and for activities in which&#xD;
      forceful and/or rapid wrist flexions are required. Apart from this, the wrist flexors have a&#xD;
      distinctive neural control as compared to the other surrounding musculature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle exhaustion that is induced after eccentric exercise, can either be of acute onset or&#xD;
      delayed onset. Exercise induced muscle soreness that persists for about 4 to 6 hours before&#xD;
      it returns to pre-exercise level is termed as acute soreness. On the other hand, muscle&#xD;
      soreness beginning at 8 to 24 hours after eccentric exercise, with peak level at 24 to 48&#xD;
      hours is known as delayed soreness. Delayed-Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS) is a common&#xD;
      neuromuscular condition characterized by increased sensitivity to pain that is apparent with&#xD;
      unaccustomed or vigorous exercise, a day after performance. DOMS becomes evident about 6-8&#xD;
      hours after an intense exercise bout and peaks at approximately 24-72 hours post-exercise.&#xD;
      During first few hours of intensive exercise metabolism get disturbed that leads to&#xD;
      inefficient physical activity and performance. Prolonged metabolic disturbances and physical&#xD;
      activity and performance impairment progressing to days ultimately induce tissue damage that&#xD;
      we call as delayed-onset muscle soreness. Event that produces muscle soreness is suggested as&#xD;
      a mechanical disruption of sarcomeres leading to swelling of injured muscle fibers thus&#xD;
      initiating an inflammatory response leading to the excitement of nociceptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise-induced muscle injury is similar in pathological change and pathogenic mechanism in&#xD;
      humans and animals. Human beings and animals have shown parallel reactions to changes caused&#xD;
      by muscle damage induced by eccentric exercises. The beginning of initial exercise-induced&#xD;
      muscle damage may be draining but is pain free. Later on, after 8-24 hours of muscle damage&#xD;
      initiation, the subsequent inflammation results in delayed onset of muscle soreness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been assumed that whenever an un-habitual physical exercise is carried out by a person&#xD;
      then muscle injury occurs. A high level of muscle injury is associated with eccentric&#xD;
      activities. Muscle injury is more likely to occur in untrained individuals who start&#xD;
      practicing exercise. Furthermore, incidence of muscle injury is more common with exercises&#xD;
      involving eccentric activities. Loss of strength, muscle inflammation, high level of muscle&#xD;
      proteins in blood and delayed onset of muscle soreness DOMS are considered to be the expected&#xD;
      outcomes of muscle injury. Different electro-physical modalities are being used by Physical&#xD;
      therapists. In many conditions, improved healing and functioning are achieved by the use of&#xD;
      these electro-physical modalities. Some animal studies have also reported the positive role&#xD;
      of Low-Level Laser Therapy, when used in optimal parameters of irradiations, in enhancing the&#xD;
      muscle healing and decreasing inflammation. Increased amount and activity of mitochondria and&#xD;
      increased cross-sectional area of muscle fiber is associated with training. Increased muscle&#xD;
      mass and improved mitochondrial function result in shift in muscle fiber type composition,&#xD;
      from type two B to type Two A, and an increase in local glycogen storage capability. These&#xD;
      combined adaptations make specialized athletes chiefly different from untrained people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies performed on human and animals evidenced the action of Low-level Laser&#xD;
      Therapy in achieving therapeutic and physiological effects involving improvement of muscle&#xD;
      functioning through interaction with biological tissues. Decrease in muscle fatigue has been&#xD;
      reported by several researchers with the application of Laser Therapy before exercises that&#xD;
      induces fatigue while considerable functional enhancement has also been evidenced by some&#xD;
      investigators with Laser application after performing fatigue inducing exercises. Therapeutic&#xD;
      effect of LLLT may be explained by mechanisms involving improved microcirculation of tissue,&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effect, decreased oxidative stress and decrease in tissue ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2016, a study was conducted to evaluate the effects of low level laser therapy on post&#xD;
      exercise recovery of skeletal muscle and improvement in muscle performance and function. The&#xD;
      conclusion of this study was that pre-exercise treatment with low level laser therapy&#xD;
      increases muscle performance along with improvement in biochemical markers associated with&#xD;
      inflammation and muscle injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In August 2011, Wouber Hérickson de Brito and fellows carried out a comparative study to&#xD;
      investigate whether muscle performance could be increased with endurance training associated&#xD;
      with LLLT when compared to the same training without LLLT. Results suggested a great decrease&#xD;
      in fatigue when training was combined with LLLT, thus improving the muscle performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In August 2010, a study was carried out to find out the effectiveness of low-level laser&#xD;
      therapy (LLLT) on muscle performance, fatigue development, and biochemical markers of&#xD;
      post-exercise recovery on bicep muscle. Results clearly suggested that endurance for&#xD;
      repetitive elbow flexion has been increased with the application of LLLT before exercise&#xD;
      while levels of reactive protein, creatine kinase and blood lactate has been decreased after&#xD;
      performance of exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In July 2010, to investigate the effects of Low-level laser therapy before eccentric exercise&#xD;
      on muscle damage markers in humans. It was concluded that LLLT therapy when given before&#xD;
      performance of eccentric exercise, accelerated the increase of muscle proteins in the blood&#xD;
      serum and the decrease in muscle force.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In July 2011, a study was carried out to compare the effects of Red (660 nm) and infrared&#xD;
      (830 nm) low-level laser therapy in skeletal muscle fatigue in humans. The study showed that&#xD;
      both red and infrared LLLT are effective in delaying the development skeletal muscle fatigue&#xD;
      and in improvement of skeletal functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In August 2009, to investigate the Effects of Low-Level Laser Irradiation on Skeletal Muscle&#xD;
      Injury after Eccentric Exercise. It was the first study performed on animal model to&#xD;
      investigate these effects. It was concluded that Low-level He-Ne laser therapy exerts&#xD;
      therapeutic effects by improving anti-oxidative capacity of muscle as well as decreasing the&#xD;
      inﬂammatory reaction.&#xD;
