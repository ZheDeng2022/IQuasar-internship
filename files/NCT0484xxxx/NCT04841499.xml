      Protocol Outline&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol Title: Effects of a seven-day BASIS™ supplementation on menopausal syndromes and&#xD;
      measurements of the urinary vitamin B3 and estradiol levels in pre-, peri- and&#xD;
      post-menopause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Abstract&#xD;
&#xD;
      Context:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is a derivative of vitamin B3 necessary to the&#xD;
      production of key hormonal regulators like estradiol. As we age, both NAD levels and&#xD;
      estradiol levels are reduced. Reduced estradiol levels have been associated with menopausal&#xD;
      syndromes. BASIS™ recent clinical outcomes have shown that this NAD precursor (BASIS™) boosts&#xD;
      declining NAD levels. In an n=1 study, repeated over 3 years, a short intake (&lt;1week at&#xD;
      125mg/day) of over-the-counter nicotinamide riboside, one of the two active ingredients of&#xD;
      BASIS™, by a peri-menopausal 50-year-old female, resulted in the blunting of the undesirable&#xD;
      menopausal effects such as poor sleep and hot flashes. The other component of BASIS™ is&#xD;
      pterostilbene, a phytoestrogen, derivative of resveratrol. Phytoestrogens associate with the&#xD;
      protection of estradiol levels and relief of menopausal syndrome in women using&#xD;
      over-the-counter phytoestrogens. These outcomes and observations have prompted the proposed&#xD;
      study. We wish to establish whether the observed beneficial effects of nicotinamide riboside&#xD;
      and the reported beneficial effects of phytoestrogens on menopausal syndromes can work&#xD;
      synergistically with a product like BASIS™ and are observed more broadly in peri- and&#xD;
      menopausal women. Furthermore, we wish to establish whether remediation of symptoms can be&#xD;
      attributed to a naturally occurring increase in estradiol levels following the repletion of&#xD;
      NAD by BASIS™.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first objective is to determine whether a short supplementation with BASIS™ increases the&#xD;
      natural production of estradiol, measured in urinary waste. The second objective is to&#xD;
      determine whether, through increased estradiol levels, the undesirable menopausal effects are&#xD;
      mitigated by a short-term supplementation with BASIS™.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women suffering from undesirable menopause-related discomfort will be entered in this study.&#xD;
      Discomfort includes mood swings, hot flashes, bad sleep, and dry skin. The control cohort&#xD;
      will be composed of women who are pre-menopausal. All women entering the study will be given&#xD;
      a questionnaire before taking BASIS™ and once they have completed the 7-day supplementation.&#xD;
      They will also be asked to provide a urine sample at the time of each survey. The urine&#xD;
      samples will be analyzed for total estradiol content (estradiol, sulfate and glucoronate, and&#xD;
      estriol; all metabolites of estradiol) and for total vitamin B3 content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Background and Significance/Preliminary Studies Menopause signals the end of the natural&#xD;
      reproductive potential and declining hormone levels for women; hormones such as estradiol.&#xD;
      Typically, a well-orchestrated sequence of estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone&#xD;
      production occurs each month with ovulation, but as we age, sex hormone levels start to&#xD;
      fluctuate and eventually decline significantly. This can last for upwards of 10 years prior&#xD;
      to the last menstrual cycle (peri-menopause).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our brain, muscle, liver, skin, and fat cells all have hormone receptors, thus as changes&#xD;
      occur, they affect organ function on a cellular level. The climacteric syndrome is&#xD;
      characterized by several symptoms: hot flashes are the most common and reported by about 70%&#xD;
      of peri- post-menopausal women. Sleep disorders particularly decreased sleep quality, and&#xD;
      irritability are also commonly reported. Common biological mechanisms may explain in part the&#xD;
      relationship between hot flushes, sleep disorders, and irritability. For example, withdrawal&#xD;
      of hormones causes a change in the serotonin levels. The serotonergic system is implicated in&#xD;
      sleep, mood, and hot flashes. Tryptophan, an essential amino acid, is the precursor for&#xD;
      serotonin synthesis. Critically, tryptophan is also a precursor to nicotinamide adenine&#xD;
      dinucleotide, NAD[5]. NAD and its derivative NADPH are central cofactors to cellular&#xD;
      metabolism and cellular signaling with critical roles in aging. They are also co-substrates&#xD;
      in many biosynthetic pathways, including of estrogen-derived hormones such as estradiol.&#xD;
      Increased oxidative stress and declining NAD levels would affect the biosynthetic pathways&#xD;
      leading to estradiol[6]. Critically, estradiol levels steadily decrease over the course of&#xD;
      peri and post-menopause; a process which has been correlated to the occurrence and intensity&#xD;
      of menopausal symptoms&#xD;
      (https://www.menopause.org/for-women/menopauseflashes/menopause-symptoms-and-treatments/the-e&#xD;
      xperts-do-agree-about-hormone-therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent investigations in the field of NAD and NADP have unveiled a range of biosynthetic,&#xD;
      orally available precursors (nicotinamide riboside and nicotinamide mononucleotide), which&#xD;
      are able to boost NAD levels systemically[7]. This has led to a vast number of clinical&#xD;
      trials to investigate whether and if so by how much these precursors could boost circulating&#xD;
      NAD and alleviate age-associated disorders, such a metabolic dysfunction, obesity and&#xD;
      cellular aging. It has been suggested that oxidative stress, which increased NAD levels&#xD;
      appears to remediate, may also play a role in sleep disorders. While the outcomes remain&#xD;
      inconclusive in terms of clinical impact, these NAD precursors were shown to be safe and&#xD;
      well-tolerated by numerous types of participants at dosages as high as 1gram/day. One of&#xD;
      these trials included BASIS™. In addition to nicotinamide riboside, BASIS™ also includes&#xD;
      pterostilbene in its formulation. Critically, resveratrol and pterostilbene have a similar&#xD;
      chemical structure to the diethylstilbestrol and 17-beta estradiol and act as phytoestrogens,&#xD;
      protectors of estradiol levels. Furthermore, estrogen-like entities, phytoestrogen are&#xD;
      thought to enhance NAD function in cellular metabolism[8].&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that as we age, a reduction in NAD levels and a shift in redox balance leading&#xD;
      and causing oxidative stress could correlate to a decrease in the production of estradiol.&#xD;
      This causation could be direct, by simply reducing the activity of the NAD(P) dependent&#xD;
      enzymes involved in the synthesis of estradiol and its precursors or indirect by&#xD;
      NAD-dependent protein post-translational modulation of gene expression pathways that impact&#xD;
      estradiol biosynthesis and function. A nutraceutical approach that combines increased levels&#xD;
      of NAD(P) to phytoestrogens like pterostilbene may be useful to preventive or at least&#xD;
      moderate the intensity of the menopausal syndromes controlled by reduced estradiol levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Study Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study that seeks to enroll up to 40 female individuals over 35 years of age.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a short supplementation (7days) with BASIS™&#xD;
      increases the natural production of estradiol, measured in urinary waste. The overall&#xD;
      objective is to determine whether through increased estradiol levels, the undesirable&#xD;
      menopausal effects, assessed via questionnaires, are mitigated by a short-term&#xD;
      supplementation with BASIS™&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Administrative Organization&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be administered at the MCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Experimental design of the study: This is a single-arm study for which non-peri and&#xD;
           non-menopausal women will act as a control cohort. We will seek for 25% of the recruited&#xD;
           cohort to be within the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study population general description: Any healthy women older than 35years of age can&#xD;
           partake in this study. However, individuals receiving hormone replacement therapy will&#xD;
           be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sample size determination and power analyses: This is a pilot study to establish the&#xD;
           proposed correlation between metabolites. Studies as small as 12 individuals have been&#xD;
           conducted to establish pharmacological roles for nicotinamide riboside as well as for&#xD;
           pterostilbene. Similar sample sizes have been employed to investigate the properties of&#xD;
           exogenous estradiol on sleep quality and hot flashes[9].&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The outcomes of the study are three folds:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. A correlation between levels of estradiol and bioavailability of circulating NAD&#xD;
                boosted by nicotinamide riboside will be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. A correlation between NAD bioavailability and the occurrence and intensity of&#xD;
                undesirable menopausal symptoms will be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. A correlation between the synergistic effect of NAD increase and pterostilbene on&#xD;
                the occurrence and intensity of undesirable menopausal symptoms by naturally&#xD;
                enhancing levels of estradiol will be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      d. Study Assessments and Activities i. Following completion of the consent form, the&#xD;
      participants will be asked to fill a pre-supplementation questionnaire. They then will be&#xD;
      asked to provide a urinary sample after being given a urine sampling kit. Following this, the&#xD;
      participant will be provided with a small jar of BASISTM (supplies≥7days). The participant&#xD;
      will take 2 capsules of BASISTM once a day (total daily dose contains 250mg of nicotinamide&#xD;
      riboside and 50mg of pterostilbene). After 7 days, the participants will be asked to provide&#xD;
      a second urine in the urine sampling kit provided to them and fill in the same questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. The questionnaire aims to evaluate the intensity and frequency of the most common&#xD;
      menopause-associated undesirable symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. Provide a schedule of all study assessments and subject activities, including a tabular&#xD;
      representation or timeline as applicable:&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv. Following completion of the consent form, the participants will be asked to fill in a&#xD;
      pre-supplementation questionnaire. They then will be asked to provide a urinary sample after&#xD;
      being given a urine sampling kit. Following this, the participant will be provided with a&#xD;
      small jar of BASIS™ (supplies&gt;7days). The participant will take 2 capsules of BASIS™ once a&#xD;
      day (total daily dose contains 250 mg of nicotinamide riboside and 50 mg of pterostilbene).&#xD;
      After 7 days, the participants will be asked to provide a second urine sample in the urine&#xD;
      sampling kit provided to them and fill in the same questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      v. The questionnaire aims to evaluate the intensity and frequency of the most common&#xD;
      menopause-associated undesirable symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      vi. Provide a schedule of all study assessments and subject activities, including a tabular&#xD;
      representation or timeline as applicable (visit chart in the full protocol)&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. Analysis Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a short-term metabolic study for which pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics outcomes&#xD;
      are anticipated. There will be no intention-to-treat methodology in the analysis. There will&#xD;
      be no sample stratification. The urine content of the NAD and estradiol catabolomes'&#xD;
      measurements will be presented as mean of biological replicates and 95% confidence interval&#xD;
      (CI) from all analyzed LC-MS measurements pooled from 2 technical replicates. For multiple&#xD;
      comparisons, ANOVA followed by posthoc test, i.e., Bonferroni correction for LC-MS and&#xD;
      Dunnett's or Tukey's for combination with questionnaire outcomes. Dependent t-tests and&#xD;
      repeated measures ANOVA will be used to evaluate within sub-groups variability. Statistical&#xD;
      analysis is performed using GraphPad PRISM 7.&#xD;
&#xD;

      All reports will be provided to the IRB of record and the study sponsor, Elysium Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Person(s) Responsible for Data Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of monitoring is to ensure the rights of the human participants are protected,&#xD;
      the clinical trial is conducted in compliance with established guidelines and protocol as&#xD;
      well as to confirm that the data collected is accurate. Monitoring is performed by Dr. Marie&#xD;
      Migaud, that is assigned to the study and familiar with the Protocol, Informed Consent, SOPs,&#xD;
      etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reporting Unanticipated Problems, Adverse Events, Protocol Deviations and Protocol&#xD;
      Violations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol deviations are to be documented by the PI (Dr Migaud) using the Protocol Deviation&#xD;
      Form and sent via e-mail to the IRB for review. Deviations that are considered major because&#xD;
      they impact subject safety or alter the risk/benefit ratio, compromise the integrity of the&#xD;
      study data, and/or affect subjects' willingness to participate in the study must be reported&#xD;
      within 10 calendar days of awareness of the event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI will be responsible for reporting adverse events experienced by participants under&#xD;
      their care, untoward events occurring during the course of the study, protocol deviations and&#xD;
      protocol violation by completing Protocol Deviation Forms and acknowledgments for regulatory&#xD;
      filing to the sponsor. Protocol Deviations will be reported in monitoring reports:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When the site is requesting a waiver or when a deviation from the protocol has occurred&#xD;
           using the process noted above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Sponsor Team (Elysium Health) and the IRB, in turn, review and respond to the&#xD;
           deviation. At times, the Sponsor Team may request additional information from the site&#xD;
           to clarify the deviation or waiver request.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures and Time Frames for Communicating Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of the primary objective will be performed and reviewed for impact. Additionally,&#xD;
      review of adverse events will occur monthly for the first 3 months and then quarterly&#xD;
      thereafter until completion of the study. Possible Adverse Events will be reviewed by the&#xD;
      Study's Clinical Principal and co-Principal Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emergency Actions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unblinding- This is not a blinded study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stopping Rules- This is a basic research study with no predefined endpoints other than data&#xD;
      acquisition to support or invalidate a hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pre-defined safety-efficacy stopping points for the entire study that would cause the&#xD;
      study to be suspended or terminated would be if there are concerns about the safety of the&#xD;
      participant or about data integrity.&#xD;
