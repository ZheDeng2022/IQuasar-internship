  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate whether a trained community&#xD;
      health worker (CHW) who engages with newly diagnosed patients after a diagnosis of cancer can&#xD;
      effectively improve knowledge and receipt of evidence-based precision medicine cancer care&#xD;
      services among low-income and minority patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to reduce cancer disparities by improving the knowledge and&#xD;
      delivery of evidence-based precision medicine for cancer care. We plan to randomize newly&#xD;
      diagnosed patients and those currently under cancer care to either a control arm (usual&#xD;
      cancer care alone) versus an intervention arm (layered on top of usual cancer care alone)&#xD;
      where patients are assigned to a community health worker who will assist patients in ensuring&#xD;
      the following discussions with their care team: 1) precision cancer care 2) cancer diagnosis&#xD;
      and treatment plan 2) adherence to treatments and 3) goals of care and symptom burden. A&#xD;
      total of 55 participants per study group (total 110) will be recruited in Monterey County&#xD;
      from Pacific Cancer Care.&#xD;

All participants who consent to the study will be randomized 1:1 into the usual oncology care arm versus the intervention arm. Patients randomized into the intervention arm will be assigned a community health worker who will begin the intervention.

    <time_frame>Time of Enrollment to 3-months post-enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Using 7 multiple choice items adapted from an 8-item survey tool, Knowledge and Purpose of Molecular Profiling, by Davies et. al., 2020, we will assess knowledge of precision medicine (molecular profiling and tumor testing) for cancer care. All questions are multiple choice. For example one question asks 'tumor testing is helpful for making decisions about future cancer risks,' with answer choices: always, frequently, sometimes, rarely, never, or I don't know. Answers will be scored as number or percent correct.&#xD;

    <measure>Patient activation using the &quot;Patient Activation Measure&quot; survey</measure>
    <time_frame>3-months post-enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Each patient will receive a validated patient activation survey using the &quot;Patient Activation Measure&quot; at enrollment and 3 months after study enrollment. This is a validated measure from Insignia Health. Responses are: disagree strongly, disagree, agree, agree strongly with higher activation correlated with responses of agree and agree strongly. Each item is rated on 4-point scale (1 strongly disagree to 4 strongly agree, with additional &quot;not applicable&quot; option). Higher scores indicate greater patient activation. For the PAM-10, minimum score is 0 (if all not-applicable) and maximum is 40. Raw scores are converted into activation levels per the scoring guidelines by Insignia Health for: level 1 Disengaged and Overwhelmed, level 2 Becoming Aware but Still Struggling, level 3 Taking Action and Gaining Control, level 4 Maintaining &quot;Behaviors and Pushing Further. Scores for each group will be averaged at 3 months after study enrollment.</description>

    <time_frame>Time of enrollment to 3-months post-enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Each patient will the validated &quot;Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General Survey (FACT-G), &quot; which is a 27-item survey with response options including: not at all, a little bit, somewhat, quite a bit, or very much. Five items also allow for a response of 'prefer not to answer.' Scoring for the FACT-G will be done in accordance with the FACT-G Scoring Guidelines (Version 4), available here: https://www.facit.org/measures-scoring-downloads/fact-g-scoring-downloads . In summary, scoring is for four subscales included within the survey, including (1) Physical Well-Being (score range: 0-28), (2) Social Family Well-Being (score range: 0-28), (3) Emotional Well-Being (score range: 0-24), and (4) Functional Well-Being (score range: 0-28). A total score is created from the sum of the subscale scores and has a minimum of zero and maximum of 108, where a higher score indicates greater quality of life. We will measure the change in quality of life at baseline to 3 months.</description>
