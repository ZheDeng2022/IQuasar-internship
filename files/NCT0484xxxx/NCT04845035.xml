  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will combine a standard, pediatric-inspired, chemotherapy regimen with the&#xD;
      tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) Dasatinib and Ponatinib to treat adults with Philadelphia&#xD;
      Chromosome-Positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two age groups/cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  participants aged 18 to 59 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  participants aged 60 years and older&#xD;
&#xD;
      One tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), either Dasatinib or Ponatinib, will be administered in&#xD;
      each of the respective chemotherapy cycles. The TKI (either Dasatinib or Ponatinib)&#xD;
      administered in a given cycle of chemotherapy will be dictated by the given cycle's standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy, in order to minimize overlapping side effects of the chemotherapy and TKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dosages of the standard chemotherapy agents, as well as the tyrosine kinase inhibitors&#xD;
      (TKIs)--Dasatinib and Ponatinib--have been adjusted for each age group to allow continuous&#xD;
      administration of these TKIs.&#xD;
