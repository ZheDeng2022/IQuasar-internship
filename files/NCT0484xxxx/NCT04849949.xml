  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Walnuts are a nutrient dense food, but most health research is on English walnuts (EW). Black&#xD;
      walnuts (BW) contain a different antioxidant and fatty acid profile, and more protein,&#xD;
      compared to EW. The purpose of the study was to compare postprandial responses following the&#xD;
      consumption of 3 breakfast meals containing either butter (control), BW, or EW.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was a randomized, double-blind control trial consisting of 3 study visits for 3&#xD;
      different treatments. The treatments were high-fat breakfast muffins containing either butter&#xD;
      (control), black walnuts, or English walnuts. The investigators recruited healthy,&#xD;
      normal-weight adults between the ages of 15 and 45y. Study visits were completed in a random&#xD;
      order with at least 72 hours between each visit. Anthropometrics, questionnaires, and fasting&#xD;
      and postprandial blood samples were collected at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The walnut-containing meals would mitigate post-meal increases in glucose,&#xD;
      insulin, triglycerides (TG), and lipid peroxidation while improving all measures of&#xD;
      subjective appetite and TAC compared to the traditional meal without nuts.&#xD;
