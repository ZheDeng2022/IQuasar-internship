  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II treatment study that is done to evaluate how effective and safe the&#xD;
      combination of pembrolizumab and cisplatin work in treating participants with triple-negative&#xD;
      breast cancer that had spread to other parts of the body, has come back, or cannot be removed&#xD;
      by surgery. Pembrolizumab (investigational drug) is a monoclonal antibody that works by&#xD;
      helping your immune system to fight cancer. Cisplatin is a chemotherapy drug that works by&#xD;
      interfering with tumor cell division. Studies also suggest that treatment with chemotherapy,&#xD;
      like cisplatin, may improve the effectiveness of pembrolizumab. This study will test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of pembrolizumab and cisplatin in participants with advanced triple-negative&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Participants will receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and cisplatin once&#xD;
      every 3 weeks for a total of 6 doses. Both drugs are given by vein (Intravenous(IV)) on day&#xD;
      1. Participants that are responding to the study treatment will continue to receive&#xD;
      pembrolizumab alone for up to 24 months until disease gets worse, having bad side effects, no&#xD;
      longer wish to be in the study, or have become pregnant (whichever comes first).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to study drug administration visits, participants will be asked to have physical&#xD;
      exams, blood draws every three weeks and tumor evaluation using MRI or CT scans every 9&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for safety within at 30&#xD;
      days of last dose of study treatment and then every 12 weeks until study completion.&#xD;
