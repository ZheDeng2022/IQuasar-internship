  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to compare the clinical outcomes of a mixed home-based rehabilitation&#xD;
      program after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, incorporating face-to-face sessions as well&#xD;
      as sessions performed with a novel digital kinematic biofeedback system against conventional&#xD;
      in-person home-based rehabilitation, with the intent of reducing the need for face-to-face&#xD;
      sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the clinical outcomes of such a program will be at least&#xD;
      similar to those of conventional rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled pre-operatively and then randomized into 2 groups: experimental&#xD;
      group and conventional rehabilitation group. Both groups will perform a 12 to 16-week&#xD;
      rehabilitation program starting immediately after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will be measured at baseline, 8 and 12 weeks. In patients where a decision is made&#xD;
      to extend the program to 16 weeks, another assessment will be made at this point.&#xD;

    <description>The Constant Score is a functional assessment score specific to the shoulder region. It is the most used instrument to assess the shoulder in Europe and its psychometric properties prove it to be a valid, reliable and responsive measure.</description>

    <description>The QuickDASH is an 11-item self-administered outcome measure, specific to measure disability and symptoms in individuals with musculoskeletal disorders of the upper limb.It is an instrument widely used for clinical or research purposes and which has proven to be a valid, reliable and responsive measure.</description>
