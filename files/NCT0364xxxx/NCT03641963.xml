    <textblock>
      Space-occupying, malignant middle cerebral artery (M-MCA) infarctions are still one of the&#xD;
      most devastating forms of ischemic stroke, with a mortality of up to 80% in untreated&#xD;
      patients. It is reported that early hemicraniectomy leads to a substantial decrease in&#xD;
      mortality at 6 and 12 months and is likely to improve functional outcome. Thus, this study&#xD;
      investigates if non-invasive intracranial pressure (ICP) measuring could represent an&#xD;
      objective value to determine the time point to indicate decompressive craniectomy surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there are still important questions about the individual indication for&#xD;
      decompressive surgery. In consideration of a variable clinical course (some patients develop&#xD;
      fatal brain edema early, whereas other patients do not show severe brain swelling for several&#xD;
      days), achieving a way to measure, control and predict malignant brain edema formation would&#xD;
      be of extremely important value.&#xD;

      Space-occupying, malignant middle cerebral artery (M-MCA) infarctions are still one of the&#xD;
      most devastating forms of ischemic stroke, with a mortality of up to 80% in untreated&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actually, M-MCA infarctions constitute between 1% to 10% of all supratentorial ischemic&#xD;
      strokes, with a yearly incidence about 10-20/100.000 people. The etiology of malignant MCA&#xD;
      infarctions is mostly due to thrombosis or embolic occlusion of either the internal carotid&#xD;
      artery or the proximal MCA. The term M-MCA is referred to a severe MCA syndrome with typical&#xD;
      clinical symptoms (hemiparesis to hemiplegia, severe sensory deficits, head and eye&#xD;
      deviation, hemi-inattention, and, if the dominant hemisphere is involved, global aphasia),&#xD;
      following a uniform clinical course (progressive deterioration of conscious within the first&#xD;
      24-48 h), and ending in herniation. An early diagnosis is essential and depends on CT&#xD;
      (Computed Tomography) and MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) to aid the prediction of a&#xD;
      malignant course, but, until today there is no clear consensus to define and predict&#xD;
      radiologically a malignant evolution in early phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several pharmacological strategies have been proposed but the efficacy of these approaches&#xD;
      has not been supported by adequate evidence from clinical trials and, until recently,&#xD;
      treatment of malignant MCA infarctions has been a major unmet need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past 10 years, results from randomised controlled trials (RCT) (HAMLET, DECIMAL and&#xD;
      DESTINY) and their pooled analyses have provided evidence that an early hemicraniectomy leads&#xD;
      to a substantial decrease in mortality at 6 and 12 months and is likely to improve functional&#xD;
      outcome. However, there are still important questions about the individual indication for&#xD;
      decompressive surgery. In consideration of a variable clinical course (some patients develop&#xD;
      fatal brain edema early, whereas other patients do not show severe brain swelling for several&#xD;
      days), achieving a way to measure, control and predict malignant brain edema formation would&#xD;
      be of extremely important value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this way, the ICP measuring could represent an objective value to determine in every&#xD;
      patient the time point to indicate decompressive craniectomy surgery, and also could allow us&#xD;
      to find a correlation between the size of the infarction and periinfarction edema. Therefore&#xD;
      the optimal timing of surgical intervention can be defined and all the medical treatment&#xD;
      adjusted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, ICP can be measured and registered only using invasive techniques. The two ICP&#xD;
      measurement methods available - intraventricular and intraparenchymal - require both a&#xD;
      neurosurgical procedure, in order to implant the catheter and probes within the brain. Thus,&#xD;
      these measures include themselves a risk for the subject, and both infections and&#xD;
      intracranial bleedings are regular albeit not frequent complications. In addition, invasive&#xD;
      recording of ICP requires neurosurgical expertise and intensive care unit (ICU) facilities.&#xD;
      Therefore ICP measurement so far, is not a standard of care in stroke units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A reliable, accurate and precise non-invasive method to measure ICP would be of considerable&#xD;
      clinical value, enabling ICP measurement without neurosurgical expertise and ICU facilities.&#xD;
      Moreover, it would save the patients from the complication risks associated with invasive&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;
