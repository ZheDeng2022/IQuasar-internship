      ICAN is the first treatment to target hostile attributions after TBI, making it a novel&#xD;
      anger/ aggression management approach in this population. This is a randomized waitlist&#xD;
      control trial. The length of time in the trial is approximately 15 weeks and the intervention&#xD;
      is 6 weeks long.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ICAN is the first treatment to target hostile attributions after TBI, making it a novel&#xD;
      anger/ aggression management approach in this population. Since the investigator's prior&#xD;
      research shows that stronger hostile attributions are associated with poorer perspective&#xD;
      taking,39 ICAN employs a unique perspective-positioning technique to train perspective taking&#xD;
      and reduce hostile attributions. After recalling a personal situation in which others'&#xD;
      ambiguous actions led to an unpleasant outcome, participants will explore different&#xD;
      perspectives: sitting or standing in one position, s/he will explore his or her own thoughts&#xD;
      and feelings (self-perspective), then move to a different position to experience the other&#xD;
      person's perspective, eliciting their thoughts and feelings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 40 participants with TBI, we will conduct a Phase I, randomized waitlist controlled trial&#xD;
      with 4 data collection points: Baseline; Week 1; Week 8 (post-treatment for ICAN; post-wait&#xD;
      period for WLC); Week 15 (WLC post-treatment).&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at Week 8 and Week 15</time_frame>
    <description>The Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (AQ), is a standardized measure comprised of 34 statements to assess total aggression, as well as the following aggression subconstructs: anger, hostile thoughts, and physical and verbal aggression. Participants rate statements using a 5-point Likert scale (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).&#xD;
Total Raw Aggression scores range from 34-170. Subscales are summed to compute a Total Aggression raw score. Higher scores indicate higher aggression Total Aggressions Scores are converted to T scores (1-100).</description>

    <measure>Change in Anger Affect Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Week 1 at Week 8 and Week 15</time_frame>
    <description>The Anger-Affect Scale, from the NIH Emotion Toolbox, is a 5 item subjective questionnaire that requires participants to indicate the frequency with which they have been bothered by anger symptoms in the past week using a 5 point Likert scale (1.2,3,4,5).&#xD;
Total Raw scores range from 5-25. Scores are converted to standard scores, with higher scores indicating greater anger severity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Impression of Change for Anger and Aggression</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8 for participants randomized to ICAN or Week 15 for those randomized to WLC</time_frame>
    <description>The Global Impression of change for Anger and Aggression is a 1 item question that measures perceived change in anger and aggression Using a 7-point scale (1=&quot;no change&quot; to &quot;A great deal better, and a considerable improvement that has made all the difference&quot;). This measure will be administered to patient participants and their caregivers.&#xD;
Total Raw scores range from 1-7. Higher scores indicate greater change.</description>

    <measure>Global Impression of Change for Perspective taking and Empathy</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8 for participants randomized to ICAN or Week 15 for those randomized to WLC</time_frame>
    <description>The Global Impression of change for Perspective Taking and Empathy is a 1 item question that measures perceived change in Perspective Taking and Empathy using a 7-point scale (1=&quot;no change&quot; to &quot;A great deal better, and a considerable improvement that has made all the difference&quot;). This measure will be administered to patient participants and their caregivers.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) - Perspective Taking and Empathic Concern Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline or Week 1 (depending on when collected) at Week 8 and Week 15</time_frame>
    <description>We will use 2 subscales from the Interpersonal Reactivity Index: Perspective-taking and Empathic Concern. It is a standardized, subjective measure that uses a 5 point scale. There are 7 questions for each subscale.&#xD;
Scale (0,1,2,3,4). Scores are calculated each subscale Perspective scale scores range from 0-28 Empathic concern scores range from 0-28 Higher scores indicate more perspective taking and empathy</description>

    <measure>Change in Attributions of hostility, intent, blame, and anger (Epps Hypothetical scenarios) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at Week 8 and Week 15</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are presented with 21 hypothetical scenarios are 21. After each scenario, participants rate attributions of intent, hostility, and blame, as well as how angry they would be in response to the scenario using a 9-point Likert scale. Scores are calculated for attributions of intent; 2) attributions of hostility; 3) attributions of blame; 4) and anger responses.&#xD;
Rating Scale:1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 Scores are calculated for each attribution (intent, hostility, blame) and anger response) Separate average scores are calculated for attributions of intent, hostility, blame and ange.&#xD;
Average scores for each range from 1-9. Higher scores indicate more negative attributions or anger.</description>

    <measure>Change in The Awareness of Social Inference Test (TASIT) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at Week 8 and Week 15</time_frame>
    <description>The Awareness of Social Inference Test (TASIT) is a performance-based measure that uses short one minute video vignettes to assess emotion recognition and social inferences. Participants' responses are scored as right or wrong. Each correct response earns 1 points. Below are the three subtests that comprise the TASIT. Correct responses are tallied as total scores.&#xD;
Part I: Emotion Perception. 28 items. Score ranges from 0-28. Higher score is better performance.&#xD;
Part 2: Social inference (minimal context- not much context available to make inference of sincere and sarcastic exchanges). 15 items. Scores range from 0-15. Higher score is better performance.&#xD;
Part 3: Social Inference (Enriched context - more context available to make inference of sarcasm and lies). 16 items. Scores range from 0-16. Higher score is better performance.</description>

    <measure>Change in Difficulty with Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Week 1 at Week 8 and Week 15</time_frame>
    <description>The Difficulty with Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) is a 5-point Likert scale that participants use to rate the frequency they utilize self-regulation behaviors in response to general emotional distress.&#xD;
Total scores indicate emotion dysregulation or problems with regulating emotions. There are 6 subscales. Subscale scores are summed to generate a total emotion dysregulation score.&#xD;
Likert scale (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). Total Raw scores range from 36-180. Higher scores indicate more emotion regulation problems (worse outcome) Subscales are summed to compute a Total Emotion dysregulation raw score.</description>

    <measure>Change in The Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire (AIHQ) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline or Week 1(depending on when collected) at Week 8 and Week 15</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire consists of 15 written vignettes describing actions/ situations that were intentional (5), am-biguous (5) and accidental (5). After participants read each vignette and imagine the scenario happening to her or him, they are asked five questions: 1) why the other person (or persons) acted that way toward you (open-ended response later rated by two independent raters; score indicates ''hostility bias''); 2) Whether the other person (or persons) performed the action on purpose (1 ''definitely no'' to 6 ''definitely yes'') using a Likert Scale (Intent score); 3) how angry it would make them feel (1 ''not at all angry'' to 5 ''very angry'') using a Likert scale (anger score); 4) how much they would blame the other person (or persons) (1 ''not at all'' to 5 ''very much'') using a Likert scale (blame score); and 5) how she or he would respond to the situation, (open-ended re-sponse).</description>
