  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares the effectiveness of electronic health record (EHR)-based tools to&#xD;
      support the management of pediatric obesity in primary care. All clinicians will receive an&#xD;
      interruptive &quot;pop-up&quot; alert We will examine the impact -- the added value versus unintended&#xD;
      consequences -- of the interruptive alert on the quality of obesity management in pediatric&#xD;
      primary care.&#xD;

      The primary specific aims of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the impact of EHR-based tools for pediatric obesity in primary care.&#xD;
           Hypotheses: EHR-based clinical decision support tools that interrupt but support&#xD;
           clinical workflow will (1) improve measures of pediatric obesity care quality delivered&#xD;
           by clinicians (e.g., addition of obesity to the problem list, recommended screening for&#xD;
           comorbidities, and follow-up/referral plans) and (2) result in a reduced rate of BMI&#xD;
           increase over one year among children with obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To utilize a mixed methods approach with surveys and semi-structured qualitative&#xD;
           interviews with clinicians to (1) examine the extent to which the EHR tools positively&#xD;
           impact clinicians' awareness, knowledge and adherence to expert guidelines for pediatric&#xD;
           obesity management, and (2) to explore the barriers to and facilitators of clinicians'&#xD;
           use of the EHR tools and factors that influence adoption.&#xD;

    <description>An interruptive, &quot;soft-stop&quot; alert will pop up when a pediatric primary care provider open a child's electronic health record (i.e., a new window in the forefront of the screen interrupting workflow and requiring the clinician to take an action) alerting them that the child meets criteria for obesity based on their age/sex-specific BMI percentile. The pop-up alert includes:&#xD;
One-click addition of elevated BMI to problem list&#xD;
Reminder to utilize Suggested PowerPlan&#xD;
One-click access to a patient handout on evidence-based behavior change goals (screen time, sugary drinks, physical activity, sleep) and link to additional handouts and resources&#xD;
Tables displaying trends in growth measures, blood pressure and relevant laboratory tests&#xD;
Links to existing, evidence-based childhood obesity screening and management guidelines</description>
