  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this patent pending project, the investigators will develop an augmented reality exposure&#xD;
      therapy method for arachnophobia and fear of snake to test in the clinic. The platform will&#xD;
      include a software that allows the clinician (psychiatrist/therapist) to position virtual&#xD;
      objects in the real environment of the patient with the above mentioned phobias while the&#xD;
      patient is wearing the augmented reality (AR) device. Then the clinician will lead the&#xD;
      patient through steps of exposure therapy to the fear objects. The investigators will then&#xD;
      measure the impact of treatment and compare to before treatment measures of fear of the&#xD;
      phobic object.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure therapy is the most evidence-based treatment for specific phobias, social phobia,&#xD;
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The core&#xD;
      principle is patient's exposure to the feared objects/situations guided by a clinician. For&#xD;
      example, in arachnophobia, patient is exposed to pictures of spiders printed or on a computer&#xD;
      screen- or if available, view of a real tarantula in the office. Gradually, patient tolerates&#xD;
      viewing/approaching the spider from a closer distance, and fear response extinguishes. The&#xD;
      clinician has a crucial role in signaling safety to the patient, as well as providing support&#xD;
      and coaching. This treatment is limited by multiple factors: 1) limited access to feared&#xD;
      objects/situations in the clinic, 2) even when feared objects are available, they are not&#xD;
      diverse (e.g. different types and colors of spiders), which limits generalization of safety&#xD;
      learning, 3) when available, clinician has very limited control over behaviors of the feared&#xD;
      objects (e.g. spider/snake), 4) safety learning is limited to the clinic office context, and&#xD;
      contextualization of safety learning to real life experiences is left to the patient to do&#xD;
      alone, which often does not happen. This is specifically important in conditions such as&#xD;
      PTSD, where there is cumulative evidence for impaired contextualization as a key&#xD;
      neurobiological underpinning. 5) Lack of geographical access to experts in exposure therapy,&#xD;
      especially for PTSD, in rural areas.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety and stress-related disorders are very common. One in three people experience some&#xD;
      form of anxiety disorder including phobias, PTSD, and OCD. These disorders chronically limit&#xD;
      one's ability to function and enjoy life. In addition to the common prevalence, wars in Iraq&#xD;
      and Afghanistan have left about 13% of the returning veterans with combat PTSD, and even more&#xD;
      with partial symptoms. Lifetime prevalence of PTSD is as high as 10% in women. Economic&#xD;
      burden of anxiety disorders is between 42 to 52 billion dollars, one third of the country's&#xD;
      total mental health bill. Near 30% of this money is spent in treatment costs. Burden of lost&#xD;
      workdays only for PTSD is $3 billion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure therapy is the most effective treatment for cue-related anxiety disorders such as&#xD;
      specific phobias, social phobia, OCD, and PTSD. The core principle is exposure to the feared&#xD;
      objects/situations guided by a clinician. For example, in arachnophobia (fear of spiders)&#xD;
      patient is exposed to picture of a spider on a computer, or from distance in the office, and&#xD;
      gradually, with help of the clinician, they tolerate view of the spider from a closer&#xD;
      distance. Clinician has a crucial role as the social safety cue in this process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although exposure therapy is very effective in treatment of phobias, OCD, and PTSD, there are&#xD;
      limitations. Access and adherence to, and efficacy of exposure therapy are limited to 50% by&#xD;
      multiple factors: First, there is a national shortage of psychiatrists and psychotherapists;&#xD;
      patients often have to be on waiting list for weeks to months, and in many geographical&#xD;
      locations such services are extremely scarce or do not exist. More than 50% of clinicians are&#xD;
      not trained in exposure therapy, and there is usually geographical barriers for access to&#xD;
      skilled therapists. In general, more than half of the US counties are unable to recruit&#xD;
      mental health providers. Very frequently patients only receive medication or supportive&#xD;
      therapy for several years before they can see a specialist trained in exposure therapy.&#xD;
      Certain conditions like social phobia or PTSD make it increasingly difficult to leave the&#xD;
      house and go to the clinic. Second, the feared objects are not always available in office for&#xD;
      exposure and exposure most of the times is limited to pictures, movie clips, imagination,&#xD;
      narrative, or memories. Imaginary exposure commonly lacks the level of arousal that is&#xD;
      required for development of new safety learning. Third, patients have to practice real-life&#xD;
      exposure on their own. In vivo treatment is commonly limited: often patients do not create&#xD;
      situations that elicit the optimal safety learning, do not know how to create exposure&#xD;
      situations, or simply do not follow through because of high anxiety in the absence of someone&#xD;
      to coach them. This gap between exposure in the office, and real-life exposure remains a&#xD;
      significant roadblock in successful exposure therapy. Fourth, clinicians are usually unable&#xD;
      to provide treatment across multiple physical, temporal and social contexts that can promote&#xD;
      contextualization of safety learning. Exposure mostly happens in the physical, emotional,&#xD;
      social, and temporal context of the office visits. A fifth limitation is that current&#xD;
      exposure therapy methods, do not address overgeneralization of the fear response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Augmented Reality Augmented reality (AR) is the next wave of interactive human-computer&#xD;
      technology that provides an opportunity of mixing virtually created objects with reality.&#xD;
      Instead of creating a completely synthetic environment, AR adds virtually created objects to&#xD;
      the real non-synthetic context. These elements become part of the real context, or cover some&#xD;
      of its components. AR technology ultimately becomes less expensive than virtual reality (VR)&#xD;
      technology because it does not require modeling the whole environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have developed a proof of concept prototype. The prototype that includes a&#xD;
      scenario for treatment of fear of spiders (arachnophobia), and fear of snakes. Software&#xD;
      platform connects the patient to a clinician who is located in the same or a different&#xD;
      physical space, the patient wears the AR device, the clinician is able to see the patient's&#xD;
      field of view, and positions a virtual spider/snake on a surface in the patient's&#xD;
      environment, clinician determines direction/velocity of motions of the virtual spider/snake,&#xD;
      clinician leads patient through the process of exposure therapy process until patient is&#xD;
      desensitized to the view of the spider/snake. Exposure can then advance to higher number of&#xD;
      spiders/snakes, or larger ones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Recruitment: Subject recruitment will happen at the Wayne State University (WSU)&#xD;
      Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neurosciences (DPBN) psychiatry clinic, through&#xD;
      flyers spread on the campus, and advertisement on Wayne State's student website. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to pre-screen a minimum of 50 individuals. The actual number of&#xD;
      participants to be enrolled is 50, and the investigators have a minimum pre-screening of 50&#xD;
      anticipating that some may not qualify.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will take place at the Stress, Trauma, and Anxiety Research Clinic at the WSU&#xD;
      department of psychiatry in Detroit. Participants will do 1-4 sessions of augmented reality&#xD;
      exposure therapy (ARET), each lasting 90 minutes. The first session will include a short&#xD;
      refresher on principles of exposure therapy, and training the use of the AR equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At any time the level of distress due to exposure is determined too high, both patient and&#xD;
      the provider can abort the exposure. This will be done similarly to any other conventional&#xD;
      exposure therapy method.&#xD;
