      Main Objectives: In Chinese healthy subjects under both fasting and postprandial conditions,&#xD;
      amitriptyline hydrochloride tablets (size: 25 mg) produced by Sandoz Inc., US Orange Book,&#xD;
      were used as reference preparations. A single-dose oral reference preparation and&#xD;
      amitriptyline hydrochloride tablets (size: 25 mg) produced by Hunan Dongting Pharmaceutical&#xD;
      Co., Ltd., and the calculation of the drug by the time course of amitriptyline and its active&#xD;
      metabolite, nortriptyline, in vivo The kinetic parameters were compared, and the relative&#xD;
      bioavailability of the two was compared to evaluate bioequivalence, which provided the basis&#xD;
      for the bioequivalence study of amitriptyline hydrochloride tablets by Hunan Dongting&#xD;
      Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: To monitor the safety of fasting and postprandial oral test and&#xD;
      reference preparations.&#xD;

      This clinical study is a single-center, randomized, open clinical study divided into two&#xD;
      parts, the first part is the pre-test and the second part is the formal test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both pre-test and formal trials were designed using two preparations, two cycles, and a&#xD;
      self-crossover controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve subjects were enrolled in the pre-test and randomly divided into two groups. Each&#xD;
      group received 25 mg of the test preparation or reference preparation in the first day of&#xD;
      each cycle, before the administration (0 h) and after the administration 0.5 h, 1.0 h, 2.0 h,&#xD;
      2.5 h, 3.0 h, 3.5 h, 4.0 h, 4.5 h, 5.0 h, 5.5 h, 6.0 h, 7.0 h, 8.0 h, 10.0 h, 12.0 h, 24.0 h,&#xD;
      36.0 h, 48.0 h, 72.0 h, 96.0 h, 120.0 h, 144 h, 168 h, and 192 h blood samples were measured&#xD;
      for plasma amitriptyline concentration for bioequivalence analysis, and the concentration of&#xD;
      the active metabolite nortriptyline was determined as supportive evidence of comparable&#xD;
      efficacy. The pre-test results will provide the basis for formal testing. The cleaning period&#xD;
      is 21 ± 1 day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The formal trials were divided into fasting and postprandial trials to evaluate the&#xD;
      bioequivalence of the test preparation and the reference preparation in a single dose of&#xD;
      hollow and postprandial administration in healthy Chinese subjects. Fasting and postprandial&#xD;
      trials were enrolled in 24 subjects and randomly divided into 2 groups. Each group received&#xD;
      25 mg of the test preparation or reference preparation on the first day of each cycle, before&#xD;
      the administration (0 h) and after the administration 0.5 h, 1.0 h, 2.0 h, 3.0 h, 4.0 h, 5.0&#xD;
      h, 6.0 h, 7.0 h, 8.0 h, 10.0 h, 12.0 h, 24.0 h, 36.0 h, 48.0 h, 72.0 h, 96.0 h, 120.0 h and&#xD;
      144 h blood samples were measured for plasma concentrations of amitriptyline for&#xD;
      bioequivalence analysis， and the concentration of the active metabolite nortriptyline was&#xD;
      determined as supportive evidence of comparable efficacy.. The cleaning period is 21 ± 1 day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the results of the first part of the pre-test evaluation, the experimental design&#xD;
      and sampling time and other contents of the second part of the formal test may require&#xD;
      necessary modifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fasting test and the postprandial test in the formal test were carried out independently.&#xD;
