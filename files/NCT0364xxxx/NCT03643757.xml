  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients operated with posterolateral thoracotomy were enrolled. Post-operative analgesia was&#xD;
      provided either by TEA with 0.1% bupivacaine or pethidine based intravenous analgesia (IVA)&#xD;
      in our sample population. Perception of pain was quantified by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) at&#xD;
      rest and during coughing. Arterial blood samples were collected at 1st, 24th and 72nd hours&#xD;
      of post-operative period. Pre-operative and post-operative 72nd-hour spirometric measurements&#xD;
      were recorded&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      lung cancer patients (between ages 18 to 75 and American Society of Anesthesiologists -ASA-&#xD;
      Class I to III), undergoing an elective thoracic surgical procedure with posterolateral&#xD;
      thoracotomy, were enrolled. The study was approved by the local ethical committee in Yedikule&#xD;
      Chest Diseases and Thoracic Surgery Ed. and Research Hospital and therefore had been&#xD;
      performed in accordance with global ethical standards. Written informed consent was received&#xD;
      from all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals beyond defined age limits, patients who have psychiatric problems, auditory&#xD;
      deficit, drug abuse, severe cardiovascular system disorders or severe respiratory depression&#xD;
      depicted as having less than 50% of the predicted value of forced expiratory volume were&#xD;
      excluded. Patients refusing to give consent and to whom inserting an epidural catheter is&#xD;
      contraindicated were not involved either. Surgical procedures were performed by the same&#xD;
      team. In the operating room, if serratus anterior muscle could not be spared or chest wall&#xD;
      resection was performed, these patients were also excluded even though they had met other&#xD;
      qualifications. Finally, patients who could not be extubated before transfer were not&#xD;
      involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding pre-operative evaluation, age, gender, weight, height, smoking status&#xD;
      (package/years) and ASA score of patients were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For assessing the impact of method of analgesia on target parameters, patients were allocated&#xD;
      to TEA and intravenous analgesia (IVA) groups. Randomisation was performed by closed envelope&#xD;
      method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Features of anesthetic technique and intraoperative analgesia Before the initiation of&#xD;
      procedure, in TEA group epidural catheter was inserted by loss of resistance method at the&#xD;
      level of T3-T7 with the help of a 18 G Thuohy needle (Pajunk, Geisingen, Germany) while&#xD;
      patient was on sitting position. A test dose of 2 ml, 2% Lidocaine HCL was administered&#xD;
      through the catheter. Once, efficacy was confirmed, 10 ml bolus dose of 0.1% Bupivacaine was&#xD;
      injected. Analgesia maintanence was provided by infusion of 0.1% Bupivacaine (0.1 ml/kg/hour)&#xD;
      both intra- and postoperatively for 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia was induced with midazolam (0.04 mg/kg), propofol (2 mg/kg) and fentanyl (1mcg/kg)&#xD;
      in both groups and the neuromuscular blockage was provided with cisatracurium besilate (0,2&#xD;
      mg/kg). Then, insertion of a double-lumen tracheal tube was performed. After standard patient&#xD;
      positioning, localization of the tube was checked with a fiberoptic bronchoscope. Pressure&#xD;
      controlled ventilation was used (Primius, Drager, Luebeck, Germany) and invasive arterial&#xD;
      pressure, electrocardiography, arterial blood gas analysis, end-tidal carbon dioxide&#xD;
      concentration, central venous pressure and urine output were closely monitored in the&#xD;
      operating room. Hypothermia was avoided with the help of a warming system and body&#xD;
      temperature was kept over 36Â°C. In TEA group, absolute intraoperative analgesia was warranted&#xD;
      with 0,5-2 MAC sevoflurane. In IVA group, remifentanyl infusion (0.1-0.2 mcg/kg/min) was&#xD;
      additionally used for this purpose. If arterial pressure exceeds a value of 20% or more of&#xD;
      baseline recordings, 1 mcg/kg fentanyl was administered. Every one hour, an additional dose&#xD;
      (0.25 mg/kg) of cisatracurium besilate was administered to ensure complete myorelaxation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intercostal blockage was applied by the surgical team to the entire population before&#xD;
      closing the wound by injecting 4 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine to the region of incision and two&#xD;
      intercostal regions above and below the incision site. Once closure was started, morphine&#xD;
      sulphate (0,1 mg/kg), tramadol (100 mg), paracetamol (100 mg) and tenoxicam (20 mg) was given&#xD;
      intravenously. Anterior 28 Ch and posterior 32 Ch drainage tubes were inserted to the&#xD;
      patients to whom lobectomy or bilobectomy was performed. For pneumectomy, only posterior 32&#xD;
      Ch tube was placed. After reversal of neuromuscular blocking agents, patients with adequate&#xD;
      spontaneous ventilation and verbal response were transferred to the critical care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding to peri-operative data, procedure time, type of the operation (lobectomy or&#xD;
      pneumectomy), duration of tube drainage and presence of operation related complications were&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual Analogue Score (VAS) was used to estimate the severity of pain. A score of 0 cm&#xD;
      represented &quot;no pain at all&quot; and 10 cm did &quot;intractable pain&quot; so.&#xD;
