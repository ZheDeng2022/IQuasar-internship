  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This expanded access is the best available therapy/compassionate use designed to determine&#xD;
      the palliative benefit and toxicity of 131I-MIBG in patients with relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      neuroblastoma or metastatic pheochromocytoma who are not eligible for therapies of higher&#xD;
      priority. Patients may receive a range of doses depending on stem cell availability and tumor&#xD;
      involvement of bone marrow. Response rate, toxicity, and time to progression and death will&#xD;
      be evaluated.&#xD;

      Primary Objective is to provide access to therapy with 131I-MIBG for patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma or metastatic pheochromocytoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives are to (1) assess disease response to 131I-MIBG therapy for patients&#xD;
      with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma or metastatic pheochromocytoma; (2) gain more&#xD;
      information about the toxicities of 131I-MIBG therapy; and (3) assess improvement of&#xD;
      symptoms, including pain and fatigue, for patients with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma or&#xD;
      metastatic pheochromocytoma who are receiving 131I-MIBG therapy.&#xD;

    <description>It is recommended that patients with ANC less than 750 after MIBG infusion begin G-CSF 5 mcg/kg/day subcutaneously (or receive equivalent single dose of Neulasta every 14 days while neutropenic) until neutrophil recovery (generally &gt;5000). This will start 24 hours after stem cell infusion (if stem cells are to be infused).</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma with original diagnosis based on tumor&#xD;
             histopathology or elevated urine catecholamines with typical neuroblastoma cells in&#xD;
             the bone marrow&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metastatic pheochromocytoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;1 year and able to cooperate with radiation safety restrictions during therapy&#xD;
             period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky or Lansky performance status of ≥ 50%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy: patients must have a life expectancy of at least 8 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disease status: Failure to respond to standard therapy (usually combination&#xD;
             chemotherapy with or without radiation and surgery) or development of progressive&#xD;
             disease at any phase of standard therapy (any new lesion or an increase in size &gt;25%&#xD;
             of a pre-existing lesion). Patients may enter this study with or without re-induction&#xD;
             therapy for recurrent tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disease must be evaluable by MIBG scan. A positive MIBG scan must be present within 8&#xD;
             weeks prior to study entry and subsequent to any intervening therapy. If the patient&#xD;
             has only one MIBG positive lesion and that lesion was radiated, a biopsy must be done&#xD;
             at least 4 weeks after radiation was completed and must show viable neuroblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stem Cells: If a patient does not have a hematopoietic stem cell product available for&#xD;
             re-infusion after MIBG treatment, they may not receive a 131IMIBG dose &gt;12 mCi/kg.&#xD;
             Patients must have a hematopoietic stem cell product available for re-infusion after&#xD;
             MIBG treatment at doses of &gt; 12 mCi/kg. The minimum quantity for peripheral blood stem&#xD;
             cells is 1.5 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg (optimum &gt; 2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg). The minimum dose&#xD;
             for bone marrow is 1.0 x 108 mononuclear cells/kg (optimum &gt;2.0 x 108 mononuclear&#xD;
             cells/kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stem cell source: The patients on this protocol will have autologous PBSCs available.&#xD;

             ≥20,000 X 109 /L, and hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dL with transfusions allowed if stem cells&#xD;
             are available. Patients with stem cells available are excluded if they require two&#xD;
             platelet transfusions per week to maintain the minimum required platelet count. A bone&#xD;
             marrow examination is not medically indicated for patients diagnosed with metastatic&#xD;
             pheochromocytoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Renal: Creatinine ≤ 2 times upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hepatic: Bilirubin ≤2x upper limit of normal; AST/ALT ≤10x upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cardiac: Ejection fraction ≥ 45% on echocardiogram or shortening fraction&#xD;
&#xD;
             &gt;/=27%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pulmonary: normal lung function as manifested by no dyspnea and/or oxygen saturation ≥&#xD;
             94% on room air.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior Therapy: Patients must have recovered from all acute toxicities (defined as&#xD;

             chemotherapy causing myelosuppression&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Biologic (anti-neoplastic agent): At least 7 days should have elapsed since the&#xD;
             completion of therapy with a biologic agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Monoclonal antibodies: At least 3 half-lives should have elapsed since therapy with a&#xD;
             monoclonal antibody&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiation therapy: Three-months should have elapsed in the case of completing&#xD;
             radiation to any of the following fields: craniospinal, total abdominal, whole lung,&#xD;
             total body irradiation). For all other sites of radiation, at least 2 weeks should&#xD;
             have elapsed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cytokine therapy (e.g. G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-6, IL-2): must be discontinued a minimum of&#xD;
             24 hours prior to MIBG therapy.&#xD;

          -  Voluntary written informed consent must be obtained before performance of any&#xD;
             study-related procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that&#xD;
             consent may be withdrawn by the subject at any time without prejudice to future&#xD;
             medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with disease of any major organ system that would compromise their ability to&#xD;
             withstand therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because of the teratogenic potential of the study medication, no patients who are&#xD;
             pregnant or lactating will be allowed. Patients of childbearing potential must&#xD;
             practice an effective method of birth control while participating on this study, to&#xD;
             avoid possible damage to the fetus.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  In patients with metastatic pheochromocytoma, screening urinalysis required prior to&#xD;
             study enrollment. If random collection urine specimen is positive for proteinuria,&#xD;
             patients must have 24-hour urine protein determination. Patients with metastatic&#xD;
             pheochromocytoma are excluded if 24-hour urine protein is above the institutional&#xD;
             upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known MIBG-avid parenchymal brain metastases are excluded.&#xD;
