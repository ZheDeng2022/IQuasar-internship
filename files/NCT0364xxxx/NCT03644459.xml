  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tumors can be inactive for years, until transformation of cells into an angiogenic phenotype&#xD;
      occurs. This phenomenon is known as angiogenic switch. It is based on balance between&#xD;
      inhibitors and activators of angiogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple genetic changes and processes leading to malignancies, such as activation of&#xD;
      oncogenes, can trigger angiogenic switch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simple diffusion of nutrients and oxygen normally occurs within not more than 1-2 mm of tumor&#xD;
      tissue. For further growth, blood supply and development of the vasculature are necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angiogenesis level in a tumor and it's metastasis activity has correlation with density of&#xD;
      microvessels in a primary tumor and significantly affects disease prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angiogenesis in a body is regulated through Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its&#xD;
      receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a unique binding pattern of corresponding receptors typical for all members of the&#xD;
      VEGF family:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  VEGF-A binds with VEGFR1 and VEGFR2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  VEGF-B and PlGF bind and activate receptor VEGFR1 only&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  VEGF-C and VEGF-D communicate with receptor VEGFR3 (Flt4), triggering lymphangiogenesis,&#xD;
           and demonstrate activity correlated with VEGFR2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to studies, VEGFR1 binds to the ligand with the highest affinity, binding VEGF and&#xD;
      inhibiting VEGF-mediated signaling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VEGF-VEGFR2 binder induces autophosphorylation (and partial dimerization) of the&#xD;
      catalytic domain of the PI3K / v-akt signaling pathway receptor (Phosphoinositide 3-kinase /&#xD;
      murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog - Akt or serine / threonine protein kinase B, PKB), as&#xD;
      well as Raf and MAP2K, which further phosphorylate MAPK (Erk).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monoclonal antibody LYN00101 is not only a potent inhibitor of VEGF, also blocks autocrine&#xD;
      growth factor loops by inhibiting VEGF and VEGFR 1/2/3 receptors and effectively blocking&#xD;
      neoangiogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity&#xD;
      and anti-tumor effect of of fully human anti - VEGF monoclonal antibody LY00101 and explore&#xD;
      the potential prognostic and predictive biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will not take into account the results of molecular-genetic tests of patients&#xD;
      enrolled in the study.&#xD;
