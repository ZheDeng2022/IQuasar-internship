  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intracoronary optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging allows for high-resolution&#xD;
      characterization of coronary lesions. Difficulties in matching cross-sectional OCT-images&#xD;
      with angiographic lesion localization, however, may limit its clinical utilization. The&#xD;
      investigators sought to prospectively assess the impact of a novel system of real-time&#xD;
      OCT-coregistration with angiography (ACR) compared to OCT alone and to the clinical standard&#xD;
      proceeding (angiographic guided-PCI) all used for coronary lesion evaluation before&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). The investigators hypothesize that the use of ACR&#xD;
      will lead to less incidence of insufficient covered coronary lesions (geographical mismatch)&#xD;
      and/or a less rate of edge dissections after PCI (combined primary study endpoint)&#xD;

      In this randomized blinded pilot-study the effect of pre-PCI planning by&#xD;
      angiographic-co-registered OCT (ACR) compared to OCT or angiographic evaluation alone with&#xD;
      respect to the entire result after PCI will be investigated. A special focus (primary&#xD;
      endpoint) will be on the incidence of geographical mismatch (GM) and/or major edge&#xD;
      dissections. Eligible patients will be randomized in three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 Pre-PCI-OCT: Patients underwent OCT-imaging before PCI. Lesion assessment, selection&#xD;
      of PCI landing zone as well as stent selection will be performed by investigators based on&#xD;
      OCT findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Pre-PCI-ACR: Patients underwent ACR-imaging before PCI. Lesion assessment, selection&#xD;
      of PCI landing zone as well as stent selection will be performed by investigators based on&#xD;
      ACR-findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3:OCT-Blinded/Angiographic guided PCI: Lesion assessment, selection of PCI landing zone&#xD;
      as well as stent selection will be performed by investigators only based on angiographic&#xD;
      lesion evaluation (standard care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For outcome analysis all study groups underwent post-PCI-OCT imaging as soon as investigators&#xD;
      assume angiographic justiciable PCI-results (TIMI III, no residual stenosis &gt; 50%; no&#xD;
      angiographic definable or suspicious edge dissections, angiographic acceptable stent&#xD;
      expansion without evidence for malapposition). OCT imaging analysis will be performed within&#xD;
      a OCT core-lab by two investigators blinded for the randomization group.&#xD;
