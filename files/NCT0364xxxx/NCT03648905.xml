      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The autonomic nervous system controls automatic body functions. Researchers want to improve&#xD;
      the tests used to diagnose autonomic failure. Orthostatic hypertension is a drop in blood&#xD;
      pressure when a person stands up. Researchers want to focus on this sign of autonomic&#xD;
      failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve testing for conditions that cause autonomic nervous system failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older in one of these categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Their blood pressure drops when they get up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They have had a heart transplant or bilateral endoscopic thoracic sympathectomies or&#xD;
           have had or will have renal sympathetic ablation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart and breathing tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IV placement into an arm vein&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tilt table testing: Participants lie on a table that tilts while an IV is used to draw&#xD;
           their blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may stay in the hospital for up to 1 week depending on their tests. Tests may&#xD;
      include repeats of screening tests and:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sweat testing: A drug is placed on the skin to cause sweating. Sensors on the skin&#xD;
           measure moisture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lumbar puncture: A needle is inserted between the bones in the back to collect fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI and PET/CT scan: Participants lie on a table that slides into a scanner. For the&#xD;
           PET/CT, a small amount of a radioactive chemical will be injected with a small amount of&#xD;
           a radioactive chemical.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bladder catheter placement to collect urine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin biopsies: A punch tool removes a small skin sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tests to see how the pupils react to light&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Smelling tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thinking and memory tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have a visit about 2 years later to repeat tests.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In dysautonomias, altered functions of one or more components of the autonomic nervous system&#xD;
      adversely affect health. A subset of dysautonomias consists of chronic autonomic failure&#xD;
      (CAF) syndromes. A key sign of CAF is orthostatic hypotension (OH) due to sympathetic&#xD;
      neurocirculatory failure (neurognic OH, or nOH). Primary CAF has been classified based on&#xD;
      clinical manifestations into three forms-pure autonomic failure (PAF), multiple system&#xD;
      atrophy (MSA), and Parkinson s disease with OH (PD+OH). All three forms involve deposition of&#xD;
      the protein, alpha-synuclein (AS), in neurons (PD, PAF) or glial cells (MSA) and therefore&#xD;
      are called autonomic synucleinopathies. Clinical assessment alone often is inadequate for&#xD;
      distinguishing among these conditions in individual patients. Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)&#xD;
      is another form of autonomic synucleinopathy. This observational study continues and expands&#xD;
      on Protocol 03-N-0004, Clinical Laboratory Evaluation of Primary Chronic Autonomic Failure.&#xD;
      The objective is to conduct multi-modality testing of catecholaminergic and autonomic systems&#xD;
      in patients with neurodegenerative chronic&#xD;
&#xD;
      autonomic failure (CAF). The goals are to: (a) build up rosters of well characterized&#xD;
      patients for future experimental therapeutic trials; (b) test predictions derived from the&#xD;
      catecholaldehyde hypothesis for the pathogenesis of autonomic synucleinopathies; (c) follow&#xD;
      the natural history of neurodegenerative chronic autonomic failure (CAF); and (d) discover&#xD;
      new clinical entities involving catecholaminergic neurodegeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population consists of patients with neurodegenerative chronic autonomic failure&#xD;
      (neurodegenerative CAF) identified by on site screening at the NIH Clinical Center.&#xD;
      Comparison groups include a group on control patients with iatrogenic CAF (e.g., status-post&#xD;
      cardiac transplantation, pre/post renal sympathetic ablation, pre/post bilateral thoracic&#xD;
      sympathectomies) or PD and without OH (PD No OH), and a group of Healthy Volunteers (HVs),&#xD;
      some of whom have genetic abnormalities known to increase the risk of developing PD. A group&#xD;
      of MSA patients is included, to build up a subject roster for a planned clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational pathophysiology/natural history study with a planned duration of 3&#xD;
      years. Descriptive statistics will be done in diagnostic groups with neurodegenerative CAF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is results of clinical laboratory research tests in&#xD;
      neurodegenerative CAF patients. Neuroimaging data are from MRI and from 18F-DOPA and&#xD;
      18F-dopamine PET scanning. Neurochemical data are from assays of catechols in plasma and&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid. Immunofluorescence microscopy data are from analyses of immunoreactive&#xD;
      tyrosine hydroxylase and AS in skin biopsy samples. Neurobehavioral rating scale data are&#xD;
      from the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), Montreal Cognitive&#xD;
      Assessment (MoCA), and Uniform Parkinson s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Correlation analyses&#xD;
      will be done among individual values for outcome measures. A secondary outcome measure is&#xD;
      estimated extraneuronal binding of 11C-methylreboxetine, based on studies of patients with&#xD;
      iatrogenic CAF and desipraminetreated HVs.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITIERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Critieria: Patients referred for orthostatic hypotension. This is the main&#xD;
        subject cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previously studied and diagnosed with one of the forms of nOH or else newly accrued&#xD;
             with a referral diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension, and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18 years or older, and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to provide own consent to participate or have an existing Legally Authorized&#xD;
             Representative (LAR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        If a patient has already been diagnosed as having neurodegenerative CAF under NIH Clinical&#xD;
        Protocol 03-N-0004, this satisfies the inclusion criteria for that patient. Previous&#xD;
        enrollment in NIH Clinical Protocol 03-N-0004 is not required for enrollment in this study.&#xD;
        We do plan to recruit participation intothis study from NIH Clinical Protocol 03-N-0004&#xD;
        which has been closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        If a patient has been referred for OH, then the patient gives consent at the NIH Clinical&#xD;
        Center (and therefore is accrued) and then has screening testing at the NIH Clinical Center&#xD;
        to confirm that the OH is neurogenic. We anticipate that all patients referred for OH will&#xD;
        be shown to have nOH upon screening testing at the NIH Clinical Center. At the time of&#xD;
        screening, exclusionary abnormal laboratory test results (e.g., high serum creatinine&#xD;
        indicating renal failure) may come to light, in which case they will be withdrawn from the&#xD;
        study; however, the patient would have been accrued.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria: Control patients with iatrogenic CAF&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with heart transplants, pre or post bilateral endoscopic thoracic&#xD;
             sympathectomies, or pre or post-renal sympathetic ablation, and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18 years or older, and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to provide own consent to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria: Cotrol patients with PD No OH:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Patients with PD and no OH who have (a) already been evaluated under other protocols of&#xD;
        the AMS and are undergoing follow-up; (b) have already been evaluated under another&#xD;
        intramural NINDS protocol; or (c) have cardiac symptoms, signs, or laboratory findings that&#xD;
        in the opinion of the PI make it likely there is a cardiac&#xD;
&#xD;
        sympathetic lesion, and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18 years or older, and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to provide own consent to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria: Healthy Volunteers:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 years or older and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to provide own informed consent to participate&#xD;
&#xD;
        NIH employees may participate. There is no direct solicitation of employees/staff by&#xD;
        supervisors. Co-workers will not solicit co-workers. NIH employees are required to abide by&#xD;
        NIH Policy Manual 2300-630-3, Leave Policy for NIH Employees Participating in&#xD;
