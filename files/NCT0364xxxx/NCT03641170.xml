  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the project is to investigate the acute effect of exercise on blood glucose after&#xD;
      food consumption. Thereby the investigators wish to achieve knowledge that can improve&#xD;
      prevention and treatment of gestational overweight and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).&#xD;
      This will prevent serious complications during pregnancy and birth, but also long term&#xD;
      complications like type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) for both the mother and the offspring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion will be 60 pregnant women divided into three groups - normal weight, overweight and&#xD;
      obese and women with gestational diabetes. Participants will receive a fixed diet and go&#xD;
      through an intervention period with physical activity immediately after each main meal and a&#xD;
      control period with inactivity after the meals. Blood glucose will be the main outcome.&#xD;

      Design: Crossover controlled study. Cases: 60 pregnant women recruited at the Department of&#xD;
      Obstetrics and Gynecology, Aarhus University Hospital (AUH). Subjects will receive both&#xD;
      written and oral information before entering the trial. According to their prepregnancy BMI,&#xD;
      subjects will be recruited for three different groups: i) normal weight (BMI 18,5-24,9), ii)&#xD;
      overweight and obese (BMI â‰¥ 25) and iii) GDM. 20 women in each group. Group i and ii will be&#xD;
      recruited at the routine ultrasound scan at gestational week 19. Group iii will be recruited&#xD;
      after the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) that diagnoses gestational diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
      The routine OGTT is done at gestational week 28. When diagnosed with GDM the women are&#xD;
      referred to Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, AUH, and the investigators will recruit&#xD;
      participants from here. Participants will be examined during gestational week 30-34 where&#xD;
      insulin resistance peaks during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Participants will receive a fixed diet for a total of 8 days. The 8 days of&#xD;
      fixed diet are split into a 4 days intervention period and a 4 days control period separated&#xD;
      by two days of regular food intake. The two days of regular food intake will function as a&#xD;
      &quot;wash out period&quot; to avoid carry over effect. During the 4 days intervention period the&#xD;
      participants will perform 30 minutes of interval walking immediately after each main meal.&#xD;
      The interval walking consists of alternating fast and slow intervals (3 minutes each) aiming&#xD;
      at &gt; 70% and &lt; 40% of peak energy expenditure measured by the Sensewear Armband. During the 4&#xD;
      days control period the participants will be normally active, not performing any set physical&#xD;
      activity. Participants will be randomized to the order of the two periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study variables: Fasting blood samples will be taken on the first day of both the&#xD;
      intervention and control period and on the morning after the last day of each period. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be analyzed for blood glucose, HbA1c, C-peptide and lipid profile&#xD;
      (triglycerides, HDL and LDL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the entire experimental period, movement data will be collected using the Sensewear&#xD;
      Armband. Blood glucose will be monitored continuously using the IPro2 Continuous Glucose&#xD;
      Monitor (CGM) from Medtronic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diet will consist of three main meals and three snacks and will be calculated to match&#xD;
      their metabolic need. The calculations will be done by a nutrition specialist and will&#xD;
      include weight, height, BMI and energy need during 3rd trimester pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on demography, family history of diabetes, prepregnancy BMI, gestational weight gain and&#xD;
      complications during pregnancy are collected from medical records of the patients and their&#xD;
      offspring.&#xD;
