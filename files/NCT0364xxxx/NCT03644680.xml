    <textblock>
      IgE-associated allergy is a hypersensitivity disease affecting more than 25% of the&#xD;
      population in industrialised countries. The recognition of allergen by immunoglobulin E (IgE)&#xD;
      plays a central role in the cause of allergic diseases. Both seasonal and nasal provocation&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated the rise in specific IgE after allergen exposure. Additionally&#xD;
      changes in other clinical and immunological parameters (e.g. nasal blockage, mast cell and&#xD;
      basophil sensitivity, various cytokines or T cell profiles) in response to allergen exposure&#xD;
      have been described. However the time sensitive interplay of these various factors such as&#xD;
      the relationship between rise in IgE levels and change in basophils sensitivity or cytokine&#xD;
      profiles is not yet fully understood. Clarifying how these various factors interact and&#xD;
      contribute to immunological responses to allergen, is crucial for the development of new&#xD;
      therapeutic approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to address these questions through a study following 36 Birch allergic&#xD;
      patients after provocation with allergen or placebo over a peroid of 6 weeks to 1 year.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rational of the Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies on the dynamics of the in vivo clinical and immunological responses to nasal&#xD;
      allergen have focused on particular parameters but have not addressed the kinetics of the&#xD;
      interplay between the different factors (i.e. allergen-specific IgE levels, local IgE and&#xD;
      mediator production, basophil sensitivity, cutaneous sensitivity). The investigators&#xD;
      therefore propose a randomized double-blind placebo controlled study where The investigators&#xD;
      challenge patients intranasally with allergen extract and then closely monitor both clinical&#xD;
      and immunological immune responses over a period of 4 months. After this a further 4 visits&#xD;
      will take place before and after the birch season.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will look at immediate and late phase immune responses to birch pollen&#xD;
      extract nasal challenge outside the pollen season. Study participants will initially undergo&#xD;
      3 consecutive days of nasal allergen challenge and then be closely followed up for a period&#xD;
      of 1 year. To assess clinical response to allergen exposure, The investigators will make use&#xD;
      of the skin prick test (SPT), total nasal symptom score (TNSS), nasal endoscopy and Peak&#xD;
      Inspiratory Nasal Flow Meter (PNIF). To assess immunological responses samples including&#xD;
      blood, nasal mucosal sampling and nasal secretions will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study a total of 36 (6&#xD;
      for a pre study) patients will be recruited into this study on a voluntary basis and will be&#xD;
      randomised to receive a nasal challenge with either birch pollen extract or placebo.&#xD;
      Randomisation will be stratified according to Bet v 1 specific IgE levels to allow for equal&#xD;
      distribution in both groups. 30 Study participants will receive nasal provocation outside of&#xD;
      the birch pollen season with either birch pollen extract or placebo on three consecutive days&#xD;
      and will thereafter be followed up at a regular basis for up to four months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, prior to the study in 30 patients, 6 birch pollen allergic subjects will undergo a&#xD;
      short protocol in order to ensure that&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The allergen concentration used for nasal provocation is sufficient to elicit a rise of&#xD;
           IgE antibodies&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. That the titrations of the skin prick test is adequate&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. That the timing of taking nasal secretions for determination of mediators is adequate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Should the results from these 6 patients reveal that either nasal allergen&#xD;
           concentration, skin test titrations or timing of nasal secretions is not adequate, an&#xD;
           amendment will be submitted to the ethical committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The shortened protocol will include 5 visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  complete screening visit&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  complete visit N1&#xD;

           Descriptions of Study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
           Medical history of patients, demographic data, concomitant medication Patients will be&#xD;
           asked for their medical history including demographic data and concomitant medication,&#xD;
           their allergic symptoms including intensity and duration and their allergic medication&#xD;
           history.&#xD;
&#xD;
           History of allergy and TNSS score&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will be asked for occurrence of sneezing, rhinorrhoea, nasal pruritus, nasal&#xD;
           congestion and sleep quality and to grade each symptom at each visit and keep a record&#xD;
           at home. They will use the following symptom score method: 0 = absent; 1 = mild -&#xD;
           present but easily tolerated; 2 = moderate - present, symptom is bothersome but not&#xD;
           interfering with daily life activities; 3 = severe - symptom is difficult to tolerate&#xD;
           and is interfering with daily life activities (24). In addition to this there will be a&#xD;
           visual analogue scale of total disease burden on the form.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Anterior rhinoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
           Anterior rhinoscopy will be performed once during the screening visit to exclude&#xD;
           anatomical variances (e.g. septal deviation) or pathological changes (e.g. nasal&#xD;
           polyps). It will be performed by using a speculum with the patient seated with the head&#xD;
           slightly back.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Peak Inspiratory Nasal Flow Meter (PNIF)&#xD;
&#xD;
           The portability and ease of the PNIF provides a unique opportunity to obtain objective&#xD;
           measurements while the patients are at home. It has also recently been validated as a&#xD;
           study tool during nasal allergen challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
           At visit 1 patients will be trained how to use the PNIF device (In-check, Inspiratory&#xD;
           ﬂow meter) and will receive one to take home with them until N5. The PNIF uses a&#xD;
           variable diameter tube calibrated directly in litres per minute along with a low inertia&#xD;
           indicator ring. The position of the ring after an inspiratory manoeuvre indicates the&#xD;
           maximum flow achieved. The device works when a patient inhales through the mouth or&#xD;
           nose, this causes air to be drawn through the meter and a cursor moves along the scale&#xD;
           to indicate the speed of inhalation. The flow rate achieved can be noted by checking the&#xD;
           position of the cursor against the calibrated scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
           PNIF in study conduct:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The PNIF will be given to study participants to take home so they can keep a daily or&#xD;
           weekly dairy (depending on the phase of the study) of their nasal airflow. They will&#xD;
           also be asked to bring them to all study visits so observed PNIF measurements can be&#xD;
           taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Skin prick test&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.5.1 Procedure: Allergens are inserted into the dermis of the forearm by gently&#xD;
           pricking the skin through a drop (20ul) of an allergen-containing solution with a&#xD;
           sterile lancet with at least 2 cm between each individual application point. 0.9% sodium&#xD;
           chloride solution will be used as negative and histamine as positive control. In&#xD;
           previously sensitized individuals, itchy swelling and a reddening of the skin (wheal and&#xD;
           flare reaction) will occur within 15 minutes upon challenge with the respective&#xD;
           allergen. After 20 minutes, allergen solutions will be wiped off and margins of the&#xD;
           wheals will be traced with a ball point pen. Transparent tape will be bonded on the skin&#xD;
           in order to transfer the outline of the wheal to the tape for the records. The surface&#xD;
           of the wheals will be calculated by digital planimetry. For inclusion, wheals of at&#xD;
           least 3 mm in diameter will be regarded as positive reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Test solutions:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Commercially available birch pollen extract and a panel of tree and grass pollen, weed&#xD;
           and perennial allergens (Allergopharma, Vienna, Austria) will be used at the screening&#xD;
           visit and will be stored according to the manufacturer's instructions. As controls,&#xD;
           sterile 0.9% NaCl solution (negative control) and histamine (positive control,&#xD;
           Allergopharma, Vienna, Austria) will be used. They will be stored according to the&#xD;
           manufacturer's instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           SPT in study conduct:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Screening Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A standard skin prick test with commercial birch pollen extract and a panel of tree and&#xD;
           grass pollen, weed and perennial allergens (all Allergopharma, Vienna, Austria) as used&#xD;
           in routine diagnostic in the allergy clinic of the ENT department will be performed to&#xD;
           assess the patient's sensitization profile at the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Screening and Visits N0, N5 - N11, S1-S4 A titrated skin prick test to birch extract&#xD;
           will be performed with increasing dilutions (dilutions will be increased by a factor of&#xD;
           3 up to 1:60 000 (=11 dilution steps) to determine the lowest concentration that elicits&#xD;
           a skin response. Skin tests to all dilutions will be done in quadruplicates. Commercial&#xD;
           positive control solution (histamine) and negative control will be done in duplicates.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Safety precautions As a safety precaution, patients will be monitored for 30 minutes&#xD;
           after testing. All investigations will be done in the Outpatient Clinic of the&#xD;
           ENT-Department, where full emergency equipment is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Blood sampling and measuring of immunological parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
           Blood samples will be taken at the screening visit and at all study visits by puncture&#xD;
           of the antecubital vein before skin testing. A maximum of 60ml per visit will be taken&#xD;
           either heparinized (e.g. for basophil sensitivity assays) or for the preparation of&#xD;
           serum (e.g. for assessment of total and allergen specific immunoglobulin levels or RBL&#xD;
           assay). Serum vials will be processed and serum will be stored at -20°C.&#xD;
           Allergen-specific IgE of blood samples of the screening visit will be measured by&#xD;
           CAP-FEIA to assess the allergen-specific RAST-class of the patients. Measurement of&#xD;
           total, free, and allergen-specific serum IgE, IgG, IgA and IgM will be performed either&#xD;
           by CAP-FEIA, by microarray measurement or ELISA. The measurement will be performed at&#xD;
           the end of the study in all collected serum samples to minimize interassay variation.&#xD;
           Measurement of basophil responses to allergen, fMLP and anti-IgE will be performed at&#xD;
           each visit. Briefly, basophils will be exposed to various concentrations of anti-IgE,&#xD;
           fMLP or recombinant allergens for 15 minutes and then examined for expression of CD 63&#xD;
           and CD203c by means of flow cytometry. Alternatively, histamine release will be&#xD;
           determined by commercially available histamine release kits.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pregnancy testing&#xD;
&#xD;
           In female patients, pregnancy will be excluded with a standard urine pregnancy test. The&#xD;
           test will be performed before the first skin prick test at the screening visit and&#xD;
           afterwards once a month.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Nasal specimen collection&#xD;
&#xD;
           Nasal specimen collection will be performed at all visits. For every visit specimens&#xD;
           will be collected using nasosorption FXi/PU (containing a synthetic absorptive matrix&#xD;
           (SAM)), or a 10 cm-long plastic curette (Both devices from Hunt Developments, UK)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Nasosorption using FXi/PU (Hunt Developments, UK):&#xD;
&#xD;
           Under visualization, the device will be inserted into the nasal cavity and be placed&#xD;
           along the lateral wall against the inferior turbinate. The index finger of the patient&#xD;
           will be used to press onto the external aspects of the alar and lateral nasal cartilages&#xD;
           to hold the device in place. After 1 minute, the devices will be removed and the fluid&#xD;
           will be extracted by centrifugation. Supernatant will be frozen at -70°C until further&#xD;
           analysis for the presence of allergen-specific and total Ig levels, mediator and&#xD;
           cytokine levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Mucosal mRNA sampling A 10cm nasal curette will be used. Under direct visualisation the&#xD;
           curette will be brought to lie against the mid-inferior portion of the inferior&#xD;
           turbinate. The curette will be pressed against the mucosal surface moved outwards 2-3&#xD;
           times. This motion will be repeated 2-3 times to ensure good sample collection. This&#xD;
           curette and technique have been shown to cause no significant discomfort to patients and&#xD;
           thus it has the advantage of no requirement for local anaesthetic. After collection&#xD;
           Cells will be lysed in Qiagen RLT buffer and stored at -70C for later mRNA analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.9 Intranasal challenge&#xD;
&#xD;
           Birch pollen extract (Allergopharma, Vienna, Austria) will be freshly diluted in sterile&#xD;
           0.9% sodium chloride solution and will be administered using a metered pump. The&#xD;
           allergen will be administered using a metered pump delivering 15 μl per puff to both&#xD;
           nostrils at visit N1, N2, N3. If the patient is suffering from nasal or eye symptoms&#xD;
           after the challenge, azelastine nasal spray or desloratadin 5mg will be supplied.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Randomization Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
           At visit N1 of the main study, patients will be randomized to one of the two groups&#xD;
           (Birch pollen extract or Placebo). Study subjects will be randomized (ratio 2:1 for&#xD;
           provocation versus control) using the online randomization programme &quot;randomizer&quot;&#xD;
           (www.meduniwien.ac.at/randomizer), which is maintained at the Institute for Medical&#xD;
           Informatics, Statistics and Documentation at Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.&#xD;
           The 2:1 ratio is chosen because the variance of Ig measurements and derived quantities&#xD;
           is expected to be larger in the provocation group due to expected larger overall Ig&#xD;
           levels, also see the sample size consderations later in this document.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The randomization will be carried out by a person who is not involved in the study and&#xD;
           has no contact with the patients to ensure that the study will be double blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Investigational products and study medication&#xD;
&#xD;
           Birch Pollen Extract:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Birch pollen extract (Allergopharma, Vienna, Austria) will be used for intranasal&#xD;
           challenge. Birch pollen extract will arrive lyophilised and will be dissolved in sterile&#xD;
           0.9% sodium chloride. The content of Bet v 1 in the extract will be determined by&#xD;
           immunoblotting using antibody probes specific for Bet v 1. Finally the extract will be&#xD;
           diluted so that the final concentration of Bet v 1 will be 50 μg/ml as this&#xD;
           concentration has previously been shown to elicit changes in specific IgE levels upon&#xD;
           nasal challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Control solutions:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Control solutions will comprise sodium chloride 0.9% as negative control for skin prick&#xD;
           test and as placebo for intranasal challenge. Histamine (Allergopharma, Vienna, Austria)&#xD;
           will be used as a positive control for the skin prick test. They will be stored&#xD;
           according to the manufacturer's instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Concomitant medication&#xD;
&#xD;
           General:&#xD;
&#xD;
           All additional medication being taken by the subjects on entry to the study or at any&#xD;
           time during the study are regarded as concomitant medication and will be documented in&#xD;
           the Source Data File. Concomitant medications should be kept to a minimum during the&#xD;
           study, but if considered necessary may be given if not interfering with the study&#xD;
           protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Rescue medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Although anaphylactic events are very unlikely in this study they always have to be&#xD;
           considered possible. Therefore a complete emergency kit will be available immediately in&#xD;
           case of anaphylactic reactions at SPT or nasal challenge. Furthermore if the patient is&#xD;
           suffering from nasal and eye symptoms after the intranasal challenge azelastine nasal&#xD;
           spray and/or desloratadin 5mg will be provided to ameliorate the symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Prohibited concomitant medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects must remain off medications interfering with study procedures for the duration&#xD;
           of the study. The following concomitant treatments are not permitted during this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Systemic or topical corticosteroids&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Other immunosuppressant drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Antihistamines or disodium cromoglycate 3 days prior to visits&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Systemic or intranasal adrenergic drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Psychopharmacological drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  ACE-inhibitors or beta-blockers&#xD;
&#xD;
           Adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
           An adverse event is any event during a clinical study, including intercurrent illness or&#xD;
           accident, which impairs the well-being of the subject; it may also take the form of an&#xD;
           abnormal laboratory value. The term adverse event does not imply a causal relationship&#xD;
           with the study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All subjects experiencing adverse events - whether considered associated with the use of&#xD;
           the study treatment or not - will be monitored until symptoms subside and any abnormal&#xD;
           laboratory value has returned to baseline, or until there is a satisfactory explanation&#xD;
           for the changes observed, or until death, in which case a full pathology report from a&#xD;
           qualified pathologist will be provided. All findings must be reported on an &quot;adverse&#xD;
           event&quot; page in the case record form.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All adverse events will be reported on and documented as described below. Adverse events&#xD;
           are divided into the categories &quot;serious&quot; and &quot;non-serious&quot;. This determines the&#xD;
           procedure which must be used to report/document the adverse event.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Definition of serious and non-serious adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
           A serious adverse event is:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Any event that is fatal or life-threatening&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Any event that is permanently disabling&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Any event that requires or prolongs hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Any event that involves cancer, congenital abnormality, or occurs as a result of&#xD;
                overdose (application of more than the stipulated dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Adverse events which do not fall into these categories are defined as non-serious.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Assessment of severity of AE&#xD;
&#xD;
           Regardless of the classification of an adverse event as serious or non-serious (see&#xD;
           above), its severity must be assessed as mild, moderate or severe, according to medical&#xD;
           criteria alone:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Mild = does not interfere with routine activities, acceptable Moderate = interferes with&#xD;
           routine activities Severe = impossible to perform routine activities, considered as&#xD;
           unacceptable by the physician, requires treatment, requires discontinuation of study, or&#xD;
           has residual effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
           It should be noted that a severe adverse event need not be serious in nature. Regardless&#xD;
           of severity, all serious adverse events must be reported on as below.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Reporting/documentation of adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
           Adverse events are collected by spontaneous reporting.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Reporting/documentation of serious adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
           All serious adverse events which occur during this study whether considered to be&#xD;
           associated with the study medication or not, must be documented on an &quot;Adverse event&quot;&#xD;
           page in the case record form.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A follow-up report including all new information obtained on the serious event must be&#xD;
           prepared and will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigator will submit on request copies of all these reports to the ethics&#xD;
           committee. Where necessary, investigators will inform the authorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Reporting/documentation of non-serious adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
           These are to be documented on an &quot;Adverse event&quot; page in the case record form.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           As this is a pilot study, the performed analysis are considered as explorative and&#xD;
           hypothesis generating.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patient characteristics and outcome variables will be described by calculating maximum,&#xD;
           minimum, median, mean and standard deviation for metric variables and absolute and&#xD;
           relative frequencies for categorical variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To analyse time-trajectories of IgE levels and other outcome variables, descriptive&#xD;
           statistics as well as 95% confidence intervals for the mean will be calculated for each&#xD;
           time-point and each treatment group separately. To account for heterogeneous baseline&#xD;
           levels between patients, the observed outcomes for each patient will be standardized by&#xD;
           the respective baseline values for these analyses. Further, mean differences between&#xD;
           groups and according 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for each time-point.&#xD;
           For graphical illustration, the individual trajectories of each patient will be plotted.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The data observed in the skin prick test consists of a series of allergen doses and the&#xD;
           resulting area measurements. Based on preliminary data from eight patients in previous&#xD;
           study, an exponential model of the type Area = A*(1-exp(-λ Dose) was found to&#xD;
           appropriately describe the dose-response relationship observed in the skin prick test.&#xD;
           The model will be fit for of each time point in each group using a non-linear least&#xD;
           squares algorithm. From these models, the response rate λ, the plateau area A and the&#xD;
           50% effective dose will be reported together with 95% confidence intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If there are missing values, all analysis will be done on an available case basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample size considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Given the exploratory nature of the study, the sample size considerations are based on&#xD;
           the precision of parameter estimates. The primary objective is the analysis of IgE&#xD;
           levels across time. Date from a previous study show a relative increase of anti-Bet v 1&#xD;
           IgE four weeks after nasal provocation with Bet v 1 by a mean factor of 1.4 and a&#xD;
           standard deviation of approximately 0.5 between patients. With a control antigen, the&#xD;
           mean factor was 1.04 with a standard deviation of approximately 0.25. The maximal&#xD;
           statistical precision for a comparison of mean values between the two groups is achieved&#xD;
           if the allocation ratio is proportional to the ratio of standard deviations, which is&#xD;
           2:1 based on the previous data. Under the above assumptions on effect sizes and standard&#xD;
           deviations, a total sample size of 30 (20:10) will provide 95% confidence intervals with&#xD;
           a half-width of approximately 0.2 in either group. The expected half-width of a 95%&#xD;
           confidence interval for the mean difference between groups is 0.28. (A corresponding&#xD;
           two-sample t-test would have a power of 80% to detect a mean difference of 0.4 at a 5%&#xD;
           significance level). For the analysis of the skin prick test, the preliminary data&#xD;
           suggest that with a sample size of 20, the half-width of 95% confidence intervals for&#xD;
           the 50% effective dose will be approximately 0.25 times the 50% effective dose, which is&#xD;
           considered as sufficient precision for this pilot study. Please see appendix for&#xD;
           graphical representation&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ethical and legal aspects&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study will be carried out in keeping with local legal requirements and GCP. It will&#xD;
           be performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki (1964),&#xD;
           including current revisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Informed consent of subject&#xD;
&#xD;
           Before being admitted to the study, the subject must have consented to participate after&#xD;
           the nature, scope and possible consequences of the clinical study have been explained in&#xD;
           a form understandable to him/her. The subject must give consent in writing. The&#xD;
           signature of the investigator will confirm the subject's consent. The patient may&#xD;
           withdraw the consent, even without giving comments, at any time and without negative&#xD;
           consequences for his future medical care.&#xD;
