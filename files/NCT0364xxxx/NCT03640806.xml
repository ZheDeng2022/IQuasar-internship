      Fibromy'activ, an adapted physical activity program (APA) for patients with fibromyalgia,&#xD;
      aims to provide lasting symptomatic relief, to favorably influence the life course, to&#xD;
      identify mechanisms of action and to define a reproducible interdisciplinary protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fibromyalgia affects at least 4% of the population. This chronic painful pathology is a&#xD;
      source of social exclusion with a major impact on professional activity . In France, the&#xD;
      prevalence of co-morbidities is increased in pain patients . There is a significant impact on&#xD;
      health care systems. It is very expensive for the society of about € 7,900 / patient / year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fibromyalgia population managed at the Center for Assessment and Treatment of Pain CHU&#xD;
      Timone (CETD), is characterized as follows: 50 years of average age, 85% of women with&#xD;
      children in 80% of cases. 60% have a level of education lower than the baccalaureate, less&#xD;
      than 30% have a professional activity. The duration of the pain before the first consultation&#xD;
      is on average 8.1 years. The SPICE score is above average which indicates a higher level of&#xD;
      precariousness. It is associated with dysfunctional pain adjustment strategies, psychological&#xD;
      distress, low acceptance and poor quality of life. The characteristics are close to European&#xD;
      studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Natural evolution can lead to a total physical, psychological, social deconditioning. A link&#xD;
      has been established between the severity of this pathology, a provider of precariousness and&#xD;
      the poor physical condition, related to physical inactivity. The reverse has been described ,&#xD;
      so the practice of APA brings a significant reduction in symptoms .&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, no study has demonstrated with sufficient evidence the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      practice of well-defined adapted physical activity (APA) via a reproducible program of&#xD;
      physical activity that has been the mechanisms of action that underlie this efficacy by&#xD;
      biology and functional brain imaging (PET CT) in this context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the publications mention recruitment difficulties, a high drop-out rate and a&#xD;
      difficult maintenance of the benefits of physical activity in the long term, or even a return&#xD;
      to the initial level after a few months.&#xD;

    <measure>The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>FIQ Questionnaire was developed in 1991 as a specific measuring instrument for assessing the health status of patients with fibromyalgia. The validation of this adaptation and the evaluation of its psychometric properties were carried out by Perrot in 2002.&#xD;
self-administered, exploring ten dimensions of the impact of pathology on quality of life.&#xD;
Scale from 0 to 10, a high figure corresponding to a greater disadvantage or handicap. The analysis of the evolution of the FIQ over time, spontaneously or under treatment, is therefore dimension by dimension, in order to maintain a clinical informative value, as well as by an aggregate score ( corresponding to the algebraic sum of the dimensions evaluated, compared to 100 units). A weighting of the aggregate score is expected when the patient can not assess impact on professional activity.</description>
