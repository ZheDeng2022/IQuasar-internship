  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators wish to test the hypothesis that treatment with Lemtrada is&#xD;
      associated with alterations in immune homeostasis in favor of multiple regulatory leukocyte&#xD;
      populations which persist long after completion of the treatment phase. Specifically, the&#xD;
      investigators propose that regulatory B-cells are induced rapidly following the first course&#xD;
      of treatment with Lemtrada, that this occurs prior to induction of other regulatory&#xD;
      populations, and that these cells are functionally capable of regulating immune responses.&#xD;
      The investigators also propose that there is a concomitant induction of functional regulatory&#xD;
      T-cells and alternatively-activated monocytes during the first year after treatment giving a&#xD;
      &quot;blanket&quot; enhanced regulatory immune profile. This study is designed primarily to identify&#xD;
      possible mechanisms by which Lemtrada acts to modify the immune environment in recipient&#xD;
      patients, as such the &quot;outcome&quot; measures are all immunological.&#xD;
