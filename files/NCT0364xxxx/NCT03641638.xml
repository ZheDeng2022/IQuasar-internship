  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present, attention to thyroid disease during pregnancy is increasing at home and abroad,&#xD;
      but there is relatively little concern about postpartum thyroid disease, especially high&#xD;
      incidence of postpartum thyroiditis (PPT). This observational study is to investigate the&#xD;
      relationship between different levels of thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) and postpartum&#xD;
      thyroiditis (PPT) in early pregnancy (1-12 weeks of pregnancy), and to explore whether PPT&#xD;
      can be predicted by different TPOAb levels. According to the TPOAb level in early pregnancy,&#xD;
      the postpartum of pregnant women was followed up, PPT was detected early, and intervention&#xD;
      was performed according to thyroid dysfunction.&#xD;

      First pregnant women who between the ages of 18 to 35 years old and normal thyroid function&#xD;
      before pregnancy were selected. Recruit 300 pregnant women who early pregnancy (1-12 weeks of&#xD;
      pregnancy) screening TPOAb positive and normal Free triiodothyronine (FT3), normal free&#xD;
      thyroxine (FT4) ,Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) &lt;4.78mIU / L as the observation group.&#xD;
      They will be divided into low-level group (TPOAb at 34-102 IU/ml), medium-level group (TPOAb&#xD;
      at 103-204 IU/ml), and high-level group (TPOAb&gt;205) according to TPOAb. Recruit 100 pregnant&#xD;
      women who early pregnancy (1-12 weeks of pregnancy) screening TPOAb negative and normal FT3,&#xD;
      normal FT4,TSH &lt;4.78mIU / L as the Control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thyroid function (FT3, FT4, TSH) and TPOAb, thyroglobulin antibody(TgAb) ,thyroid hormone&#xD;
      receptor antibody(TRAb) will be screened in the observation group and the control group at 3&#xD;
      months, 6 months, and 12 months after delivery. If the mother is diagnosed with postpartum&#xD;
      thyroiditis (PPT), continue to screen for thyroid function (FT3, FT4, TSH) and thyroid&#xD;
      antibodies (TPOAb, TRAb, TgAb) 18 months after delivery. The correlation between the early&#xD;
      pregnancy TPOAb level and postpartum thyroiditis was analyzed between the observation group&#xD;
      and the control group and the observation group. It was explored whether the occurrence of&#xD;
      postpartum thyroiditis (PPT) can be predicted according to the TPOAb level in the first&#xD;
      trimester. And targeted maternal effective follow-up and timely intervention to treat PPT&#xD;
      provide important basis.&#xD;
