  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although there exist interventions that therapeutically impact suicide risk, the connection&#xD;
      of individuals at elevated suicide risk to mental health care services remains an ongoing&#xD;
      challenge. One persistent barrier to mental health service utilization is help-seeking&#xD;
      stigma-that is, having negative beliefs about the implications of seeking help for mental&#xD;
      health problems (e.g., &quot;Seeking help means that I am weak&quot;). Thus, to enhance mental health&#xD;
      service use among at-risk individuals, efforts are needed to target help-seeking stigma.&#xD;
      Preliminary data from our research group indicate that a novel computerized intervention&#xD;
      based on cognitive therapy principles can demonstrably reduce help-seeking stigma and&#xD;
      increase connection to care among young adults with untreated psychiatric disorders. However,&#xD;
      this intervention has not been tested among individuals who are currently experiencing&#xD;
      suicidal ideation and are not engaged in mental health treatment. Testing the efficacy of&#xD;
      this computerized intervention among young adults at increased risk for suicide is necessary&#xD;
      to address the unique challenge of linking at-risk individuals to potentially life-saving&#xD;
      treatments. To this end, this study aims to test the efficacy of a brief web-based&#xD;
      intervention, cognitive bias modification for help-seeking stigma (CBM-HS), designed to&#xD;
      increase mental health help-seeking intentions and behaviors. A total of 78 young adults with&#xD;
      current suicidal ideation who are not currently in treatment and who report elevated levels&#xD;
      of help-seeking stigma will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) CBM-HS; (2)&#xD;
      CBM-Placebo (i.e., a sham CBM condition analogous to a placebo pill in a pharmaceutical&#xD;
      trial); or (3) psychoeducation. Participants will complete assessments at baseline,&#xD;
      mid-intervention, post-intervention, and 2-month follow-up to determine the efficacy of&#xD;
      CBM-HS in: (a) modifying stigma-related cognitions around mental health help-seeking and&#xD;
      service use and (b) increasing treatment initiation and engagement. Moreover, we will test if&#xD;
      reductions in stigma-related cognitions mediate the relationship between study condition and&#xD;
      subsequent help-seeking behaviors. Findings from the proposed pilot randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial have the potential to enhance connection to care among young adults at elevated suicide&#xD;
      risk. Importantly, the brief, web-based nature of the intervention enhances its&#xD;
      acceptability, feasibility, and scalability. Should CBM-HS demonstrate efficacy in reducing&#xD;
      help-seeking stigma and enhancing connection to care among at-risk individuals, it has the&#xD;
      potential to serve as a useful tool in suicide prevention efforts.&#xD;

    <time_frame>2-Month Follow-Up</time_frame>
    <description>The 11-item Perceived Stigma and Barriers to Care for Psychological Problems Scale (PS) measures the extent to which various concerns might affect an individual's decision to seek psychiatric treatment. Items are rated on a 5-point scale; scores are summed and higher scores (range: 11-55) indicate greater perceived barriers to care. Individual PS items will also be evaluated consistent with past research.</description>

    <description>CBM-HS is a 15-minute web-based intervention designed to alter maladaptive cognitions related to mental health help-seeking. In this task, individuals are presented with a series of statements regarding beliefs about using mental health services (e.g., &quot;Seeking help for my problems means I am weak&quot;). Individuals then select &quot;True&quot; or &quot;False&quot; in response to each statement. Incorrect responses (i.e., demonstrating help-seeking stigma) are followed by corrective feedback. Conversely, correct responses (i.e., promoting help-seeking) are positively reinforced (e.g., &quot;That's right! You are correct!&quot;). Participants in this condition will complete three separate 15-minute CBM-HS sessions.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to this condition will review psychoeducation on mental health literacy, mental illness stigma, and treatment options. Readings will be compiled from resources available in the public domain. The duration of self-directed psychoeducation will be comparable to the duration of study tasks for individuals in the CBM-HS study condition (i.e., three 15-minute sessions).</description>

    <intervention_name>Cognitive Bias Modification</intervention_name>
    <description>Cognitive bias modification (CBM) interventions typically involve the completion of brief, web-based tasks in which individuals are presented with a series of stimuli (e.g., words, sentences) and trained to respond in a manner that is positive or neutral, rather than negative and unhelpful. CBM interventions rely on the premise that repeated reinforcement of adaptive cognitions and a reshaping of negative cognitions enhance functioning and reduce distress.</description>
