    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of laser therapy on postoperative lower&#xD;
      extremity wound healing over 12 months. The investigators will include adult patients who&#xD;
      have underwent Mohs Micrographic Surgery on their lower extremities. Patients with poor&#xD;
      immune systems, current pregnancies, uncontrolled diabetes, lower extremity venous or&#xD;
      arterial disease will not be included in this study. After surgery patients will be&#xD;
      randomized into two groups. One group will receive a single laser treatment immediately after&#xD;
      their surgery on their wound while the other will not. The group not receiving laser therapy&#xD;
      will undergo a sham laser therapy treatment. Immediately after therapy and 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and&#xD;
      12 weeks postoperative patients will have a follow up visit. During these visits patients&#xD;
      wound size will be recorded, a photograph will be taken, and the wound temperature will be&#xD;
      measured. Patient will be given a diary to record any adverse events related to the wound.&#xD;

      Background and Significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      With an aging population, the prevalence of cutaneous malignancies continues to pose&#xD;
      significant burden in terms of morbidity and economic cost. It is estimated that 5.4 million&#xD;
      new cases of non-melanoma skin cancers, i.e squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma (BCC), are diagnosed each year. As the incidence of skin cancer increases, the&#xD;
      prevalence of postoperative lower extremity wounds also increases. Epidemiologic studies&#xD;
      consistently find up to 10% of BCC and 20% of SCC occur on the lower extremity in both men&#xD;
      and women, and the largest portion of malignant melanoma cases occurs on the legs of women.&#xD;
      Lower extremity ulcers are a common postoperative complication of melanoma, BCC and SCC&#xD;
      treatment, and impose an undue health care burden by negatively impacting patient quality of&#xD;
      life and increasing costs. Recent reports suggest that lower extremity ulcers cost $10,000&#xD;
      per patient per year, and patients often reported social isolation and depression, thus&#xD;
      making an improved treatment protocol for healing lower extremity wounds essential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After an acute injury, normal wound healing is usually complete within four weeks and can be&#xD;
      divided into 4 phases: coagulation, inflammation, formulation of granulation tissue, and&#xD;
      remodeling or scar formation. The initial steps of coagulation and inflammation involve the&#xD;
      inhibition of bleeding through activation of the coagulation cascade, release of growth&#xD;
      factors and cytokines such as platelet-derived growth factor and transforming growth factor&#xD;
      β, and recruitment of macrophages and fibroblasts. This facilitates removal of foreign bodies&#xD;
      and bacteria while preparing the wound site for new tissue. Around 5-7 days inflammation&#xD;
      subsides via apoptosis of proinflammatory cells followed by formation of granulation tissue&#xD;
      through dermal and epidermal cell migration to the wound bed. Granulation tissue has a high&#xD;
      metabolic demand that is supplied by angiogenesis (proliferation of new blood vessels).&#xD;
      Angiogenesis occurs due to local hypoxia during acute tissue injury which stimulates the&#xD;
      release of several factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth&#xD;
      factor 2. Lastly matrix remodeling and scar formation result in the restoration of primarily&#xD;
      normal epidermis by replacing the extracellular matrix containing collagen III to primarily&#xD;
      collagen I and myofibroblast induced tissue contraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lower extremity ulcers exhibit increased infection risk compared with other body sites, and&#xD;
      are rarely amenable to surgical closure due to a lack of suitable local skin and poor tissue&#xD;
      vascularity. As a result, many of these defects are allowed to heal via secondary intention&#xD;
      healing (SIH).The lower extremity suffers from poor perfusion and hypovascularity, both of&#xD;
      which impair wound healing in this anatomic site. Therefore, post-surgical wounds on the&#xD;
      lower extremities frequently convert into chronic wounds, defined as wounds that fail to heal&#xD;
      within four weeks and show no sign of improvement within eight weeks. This protracted healing&#xD;
      course drains the medical system of resources and subjects the patient to significant&#xD;
      discomfort and distress. The major problems reported from patients include pain, immobility,&#xD;
      sleep disturbances, lack of energy, limitations in work and leisure activities, worry,&#xD;
      frustration, and lack of self-esteem. Given the problems associated with allowing lower&#xD;
      extremity ulcers to heal by second intent, strategies that improve ulcer healing would be&#xD;
      beneficial, improving patient quality of life and preventing further complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ablative fractional carbon dioxide lasers, such as the CO2RE® (Syneron Candela Corp, Wayland,&#xD;
      MA), offer a multi-depth pulse technology that delivers a precise fractionated beam pattern&#xD;
      to treat the epidermis and dermis simultaneously. This precision technology creates areas of&#xD;
      superficial and deep ablation and coagulation to activate remodeling at several tissue&#xD;
      depths. The CO2RE® is FDA-approved and has demonstrated efficacy in post-surgical scar&#xD;
      treatment, although it has not been studied in acute, lower extremity ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the use of AFLs for wounds is novel, there are sufficient reported studies to suggest&#xD;
      it may be an efficacious intervention to facilitate the healing of lower extremity surgical&#xD;
      wounds. AFLs create microscopic wounds that can reach greater dermal depths than previously&#xD;
      attainable with fully ablative devices, and adjacent untreated skin may facilitate rapid&#xD;
      healing. Histopathologic studies of normal skin treated with AFL demonstrate altered kinetics&#xD;
      of growth factor and cytokine release, expression of heat shock proteins and matrix&#xD;
      metalloproteinases. In 3D human organotypic full-thickness skin models, carbon dioxide AF&#xD;
      therapy resulted in reduced expression of matrix metalloproteinases, and downregulation of&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, carbon dioxide AFL may offer significant advantages&#xD;
      over traditional non-ablative laser technologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mohs Surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment for BCC and SCC is often surgical. Mohs Micrographic Surgery (MMS) is a&#xD;
      surgical procedure in which skin cancer cells are removed. Once all visibly cancerous tissue&#xD;
      is removed, the tissue is examined under a microscope to evaluate for the presence of cancer&#xD;
      cells at the tissue edges. This allows the surgeon to determine if all of the cancer has been&#xD;
      removed. After examining the specimen, multiple thin sections of tissue are removed around&#xD;
      the margins of the wound and then examined under a microscope. If abnormal cells remain,&#xD;
      further tissue excision is required. This process is continued until no cancerous cells&#xD;
      remain. This technique allows for preservation of maximum amount of normal tissue and the&#xD;
      pathologic confirmation of complete cancer excision. MMS is used when there is a high risk of&#xD;
      recurrence, when the skin cancer is located in a sensitive area such as the nose or lower&#xD;
      extremities, or the cancer is an aggressive subtype. Complications of MMS include infection,&#xD;
      hypertrophic scar formation, hypergranulation tissue, and impaired wound healing that can&#xD;
      result is ulcers persisting up to 7 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovation&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project tests the highly innovative hypothesis that use of the AFL is both safe and&#xD;
      efficacious for the treatment of post-surgical ulcers. This laser technology has demonstrated&#xD;
      efficacy for treatment of lower extremity scars, but has not been adequately evaluated in&#xD;
      ulcers. Due to a unique pattern of injury induced by fractional technology where healthy&#xD;
      tissue in the vicinity of the ulcer is spared, the use of this technology may demonstrate&#xD;
      significant benefits as compared to traditional non-ablative lasers and low level light&#xD;
      systems previously used to treat ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although our proposed study is highly novel, the feasibility of our proposed protocol is&#xD;
      supported by the fact that the fractional carbon dioxide laser has been shown to improve&#xD;
      wound healing in scar-related wounds and in post-traumatic wounds of the lower extremity.&#xD;
      Based on this data, treating acute lower extremity ulcers with ablative fractional carbon&#xD;
      dioxide laser is expected to improve healing times in lower extremity ulcers occurring as a&#xD;
      result of cutaneous surgery. This work may lead to the use of ablative fractional laser to&#xD;
      support the body's regenerative capacity on the lower extremity, improving patient quality of&#xD;
      life and conserving healthcare resources. The investigators therefore hypothesize that&#xD;
      ablative fractional laser treatment therapy after cutaneous surgery is a safe and efficacious&#xD;
      treatment for lower extremity wounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the novelty of our proposed hypothesis, our study benefits from technical&#xD;
      innovation in adjudicating ulcer healing, which has previously not been combined with carbon&#xD;
      dioxide laser technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary Studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first report of carbon dioxide AFL utilization in wounds was by Schumaker et. al in 2012.&#xD;
      In their report they described three patients treated with a 10.6-um carbon dioxide AFL&#xD;
      system for multiple traumatic scars related to blast injury. Incidentally they noted that&#xD;
      chronic wounds in the treatment sites resolved within 2 weeks of initial therapy. Phillips&#xD;
      et. al observed similar results in elderly individuals with post traumatic lower extremity&#xD;
      ulcers. Their report demonstrated greater than 60% resolution of chronic lower-extremity&#xD;
      ulcers 3 weeks after a single treatment with carbon dioxide AFL therapy. Most recently&#xD;
      Krakowski et. al demonstrated near complete resolution of two chronic wounds by two months in&#xD;
      pediatric patients after treatment with CO2 AFL at a pulse energy of 50 mJ and treatment&#xD;
      density of 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MMS performed on the nose, like lower extremities, are occasionally allowed to heal by second&#xD;
      intent and can thus be predisposed to prolonged healing. Our preliminary studies demonstrate&#xD;
      the effects of carbon dioxide AFL on these wounds. Two patients receiving MMS on the nasal&#xD;
      ala were studied. One patient receiving carbon dioxide AFL therapy on his postoperative wound&#xD;
      while the other did not. After three weeks the patient's postoperative wounds were assessed.&#xD;
      The patient receiving laser therapy had complete epithelialization of his wound, while the&#xD;
      patient with no treatment had incomplete epithelization. These results suggest the hypothesis&#xD;
      that the carbon dioxide AFL may be a safe, efficacious treatment for ulcers of the lower&#xD;
      extremity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study is a prospective, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating&#xD;
      the efficacy of fractionated carbon dioxide therapy in postoperative lower extremity wound&#xD;
      healing. This study, including analysis and submission for publication, will occur from July&#xD;
      2018 to June 2020. A cohort of 68 patients will be recruited from July 2018 to July 2020.&#xD;
      Eligibility criteria will include patients older than 18 years, those with a lower extremity&#xD;
      wound as a result of Mohs Micrographic Surgery at Saint Louis University Dermatology Des&#xD;
      Peres, and a postoperative wound greater than 5mm in diameter. Patients must be able to&#xD;
      understand the informed consent, willing to come to the office for treatments and capable of&#xD;
      following post-treatment instructions. Exclusion criteria will include pregnancy,&#xD;
      immunosuppression, uncontrolled diabetes (defined as &gt;7% A1c in the last 3 months),&#xD;
      peripheral vascular disease, venous insufficiency, or no desire/unable to undergo laser&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent is obtained, a screening visit will be performed on their Mohs surgery&#xD;
      day and patient eligibility will be determined. Then, patients will be randomized 1:1 to a&#xD;
      treatment or control group via computer software. One arm will receive carbon dioxide AFL&#xD;
      immediately postoperatively on the wound base. The second arm, which will serve as control,&#xD;
      will receive sham laser therapy. Both patients will be given identical postoperative wound&#xD;
      care instructions, including vaseline applied to the wound, a piece of telfa to overlay the&#xD;
      wound, and paper tape to secure the dressing. Additionally, patients will be advised to avoid&#xD;
      baths and application of any other products to their wound. These supplies will be given to&#xD;
      the patients to eliminate wound care supplies as a confounding factor. Patients will be given&#xD;
      a diary to record observations about their postoperative wound and to note any adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be one unblinded member of the team in this study which will be the clinician&#xD;
      performing laser therapy or sham therapy, who will therefore not be involved in any data&#xD;
      collection, but will be responsible for reporting any adverse events per IRB protocols at our&#xD;
      institution. Other members of the research team member will be blinded to patient group&#xD;
      assignment, and these members of the research team will collect data (see below) at&#xD;
      subsequent visit. Additionally, patients will be blinded to treatment group. This will be&#xD;
      achieved by having patients wear safety glasses which blind them and the wound site still&#xD;
      anesthetized from the operation. Data collection will be done by a separate research team&#xD;
      member who is blinded to the treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Visits and Data Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be seen at 7 separate visits. This will include weekly visits post-operatively&#xD;
      for the first 4 weeks to monitor safety and efficacy endpoints and additionally at 8 and 12&#xD;
      weeks post-operatively. The patient's initial visit will include preoperative screening for&#xD;
      eligibility, informed consent procedure, and recording of past medical history and physical&#xD;
      exam. Once the patient is deemed eligible, enrolled, and signed informed consent, they will&#xD;
      be randomized to either carbon dioxide AFL therapy or sham laser therapy. After the patient&#xD;
      undergoes Mohs surgery with the resultant ulcer (the defect that typically forms after Mohs),&#xD;
      the patient will undergo either carbon dioxide laser versus sham laser therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will measure ulcer size, presence or absence of complete healing, wound&#xD;
      temperature, a digital photograph, wound site pain, quality of life, and adverse events at&#xD;
      each visit. Ulcer size will be recorded by placing transparent acetate paper with a grid over&#xD;
      the wound site. This will then be traced with fine point marker. The cubic centimeters will&#xD;
      be recorded along with the width (longest axis of the ulcer) and length (axis perpendicular&#xD;
      to the width). Healing will be determined by one of the licensed research team members and&#xD;
      will be defined by complete epithelialization in the absence of scab/eschar. Wound&#xD;
      temperature will be recorded by non-invasive infrared thermographic camera. A digital&#xD;
      photograph will be taken with a camera that has an attachment ensuring the same distance and&#xD;
      angle at every visit. Wound pain will be graded on a scale from 1-10 with 1 being no pain to&#xD;
      10 being the worst pain of the patient's life. Quality of life will be determined by ED-5Q&#xD;
      questionnaire. Adverse events will be recorded by eliciting an oral history and review of the&#xD;
      patients diary. Adverse events will be recorded as presence of absence of specific outcomes.&#xD;
      Outcomes that patients will be directly questioned about include: crusting (scaly or&#xD;
      thickened scar), swelling, burning sensation, xerosis at treatment site, pruritus at&#xD;
      treatment site, infection, bleeding, hypertrophic or keloid scarring, burns, or color changes&#xD;
      at treatment site. These data points will be collected at every visit, and adjudicated by a&#xD;
      member of the research team blinded to the treatment group. This member will be a licensed&#xD;
      research team member.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo treatment will consist of directing the laser system at the floor instead of the&#xD;
      patient's wound site. The patients will be wearing safety glasses and will have their wound&#xD;
      site still anesthetized from the operation therefore unaware if they are receiving the&#xD;
      therapy. This group will serve as the control group to the treatment arm in the study.&#xD;
