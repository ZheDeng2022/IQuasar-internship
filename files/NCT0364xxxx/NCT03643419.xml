  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to observe the therapeutic effect of near-infrared light&#xD;
      irradiation on the treatment of acute spinal cord injury in humans, and whether it can&#xD;
      promote the recovery of neurological function. Half of the patients underwent laminectomy and&#xD;
      decompression surgery, and the other half of the patients were implanted with irradiated&#xD;
      fibers for irradiation after surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The annual incidence of spinal cord injury has increased year by year, and there is currently&#xD;
      no effective treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Near-infrared light has been widely used in clinical medicine because of its bio-stimulating&#xD;
      effect, convenient use, harmless to the body, easy to be accepted by patients, and convenient&#xD;
      for clinical promotion. The near-infrared light biostimulation effect can enhance the&#xD;
      activity of various enzymes, inhibit inflammatory cells, inhibit neuronal apoptosis, and&#xD;
      promote nerve regeneration. It has been widely confirmed and widely used in the&#xD;
      rehabilitation of central nervous system and peripheral nerve injury. However, the position&#xD;
      of the spinal cord is deep, and the depth of illumination used by laser treatment equipment&#xD;
      is generally difficult to reach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implantable 360° scattering fiber the investigators developed was implanted in the&#xD;
      surgical site together with the drainage tube for irradiation treatment without additional&#xD;
      patient damage.&#xD;
