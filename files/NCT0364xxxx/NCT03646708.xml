  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The small bowel (SB) is involved in ~70% of patients with Crohn's disease (CD). There is an&#xD;
      unmet need for accurate and clinically meaningful methods to measure small bowel Crohn's&#xD;
      Disease (SBCD) activity. This is particularly relevant as the field moves towards&#xD;
      &quot;treat-to-target&quot; management strategies. The overall objective of this proposal is to&#xD;
      establish that radiologic transmural response (TR) and a novel proteomic biomarker are&#xD;
      accurate and clinically meaningful predictors of SBCD inflammatory activity and response to&#xD;
      biologic therapy. To address this objective, we will establish a prospectively followed&#xD;
      cohort of SBCD patients starting a new biologic therapy. These patients will be&#xD;
      comprehensively phenotyped using state of the art MRE imaging, proteomic profiling and&#xD;
      clinical disease activity indices. We will use this innovative approach of triangular&#xD;
      phenotyping to address our central hypothesis that &quot;Corticosteroid-free remission at 52 weeks&#xD;
      after biologic therapy initiation is predicted by short term radiologic TR or early changes&#xD;
      in serum proteomic biomarker profiles&quot;. Serum proteomic biomarker profiles will be evaluated&#xD;
      using SOMAscanTM (SomaLogic, Inc., Boulder, Colorado, USA), a novel platform allowing&#xD;
      high-throughput analysis of proteins through Slow Off-rate Modified DNA Aptamer&#xD;
      (SOMAmer)-based capture array. Our preliminary data using SOMAscan identified a panel of 12&#xD;
      serum proteins whose differential expression pattern from Week 0 to week 6 after starting a&#xD;
      biologic can predict week 14 clinical remission in SBCD patients. The significance of this&#xD;
      proposal is that the development of an early predictive model using radiological and serum&#xD;
      endpoints will facilitate a personalized algorithmic approach to identify patients with SBCD&#xD;
      who will benefit from treatment escalation or change to a different biologic. Furthermore, it&#xD;
      will be used to generate a tangible career tool of a prospectively enrolled patient cohort to&#xD;
      further study radiologic and biomarker predictors of response in SBCD. This award will also&#xD;
      enhance the career of the principal investigator by facilitating acquisition of an enhanced&#xD;
      skill set in clinical research, bioinformatics and biomarker discovery.&#xD;

      Patients entering the study will be evaluated by the investigator for all inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria. Once inclusion and exclusion criteria have been determined, all subjects&#xD;
      will sign an Internal Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) approved consent&#xD;
      document, which complies with regulatory requirements, prior to any study activities.&#xD;
      Subjects will be given adequate time to read and consider the consent document and all study&#xD;
      information. They will have the opportunity to ask questions of the investigator(s) and the&#xD;
      study team about the study, as well as risks and benefits, prior to signing the document.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessments will be collected from the clinical care record from the standard of&#xD;
      care visit(s) done most prior to the subject receiving their first dose of biologic All&#xD;
      assessments will be done/collected prior to the subject's first does of biologic. The&#xD;
      baseline visit will consist of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic information: Date of birth, gender, and race will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical assessment: These assessments will be done by the study team prior to the&#xD;
           subject receiving the first dose of vedolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical Exam Findings: Physical exam findings will be taken from the patient's clinical&#xD;
           care record from the standard of care visit most recently preceding the initial dose of&#xD;
           vedolizumab. If this data is not available from the visit, the information will be&#xD;
           obtained from the subject during a separate visit to the clinic by the study team, and&#xD;
           prior to the first dose of vedolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood Tests (C-reactive, Albumin, Hematocrit, SOMAscan panel&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stool Collection: At the time of consent, participants will be provided a stool&#xD;
           collection kit and asked to collect a small amount of stool when they have a bowel&#xD;
           movement, prior to their first dose of biologic, for genetic, microbiome, or biomarker&#xD;
           analysis. If the patient is unable to provide a stool sample, permission may be asked to&#xD;
           obtain a rectal swab, or a sample collection kit will be mailed to them and asked to&#xD;
           mail the stool sample back to us in a prepaid envelope. If the patient is in the&#xD;
           hospital and tests have been ordered on their stool, stool may be collected from what is&#xD;
           left over after the tests have been completed. The stool will be assigned a unique&#xD;
           specimen code. The messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) in the stool would be extracted and&#xD;
           the genetic expression profile of this sample would be determined. All participants&#xD;
           consent to having details from their medical records (age, ethnicity, medications,&#xD;
           surgery, tobacco use, family history, disease activity, disease history) at the&#xD;
           Washington University Medical Center (WUSM), and entered into a database associated with&#xD;
           a patient code. If the patient's records do not include all relevant information, a&#xD;
           study team member may obtain this information directly from the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specimen(s) will not have the participant name or address on it; it will be labeled with&#xD;
      a code in order to protect the patient's health information and identity. The specimen(s)&#xD;
      will be stored in locked freezers in a locked laboratory at WUSM. All coded specimens will be&#xD;
      linked to study participants on a separate master list, which will be stored in a locked&#xD;
      cabinet (the study coordinators have the only key) or a password protected file. This&#xD;
      information will be kept separate from the clinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endoscopic Assessment: A baseline ileocolonoscopy may be additionally performed as&#xD;
           standard of care at the discretion of the treating gastroenterologist to confirm active&#xD;
           SBCD, either before or after the MRE. Subjects will undergo standard bowel preparation&#xD;
           at the discretion of the treating gastroenterologist prior to ileocolonoscopy. If&#xD;
           treatment was required after the ileocolonoscopy, treatment will not be initiated until&#xD;
           after the baseline MRE is completed. Subjects who have had endoscopic assessment with&#xD;
           biopsies from the ileum confirming small bowel Crohn's disease as a part of their&#xD;
           standard of care treatment in the six (6) months prior to study enrollment may be used&#xD;
           for the baseline study assessment, at the investigator's discretion. If a more recent&#xD;
           endoscopic assessment is done with this reporting, the more recent assessment will be&#xD;
           used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiological Assessment: Radiological assessment will be performed on all patients as a&#xD;
           part of their clinical standard of care prior to initiating vedolizumab. Clinical read&#xD;
           will be evaluated using the assessment tool in Appendix B and guidance from Appendix A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 6 Visit (+/- 1 week)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 6 Visit assessment will be done 6 weeks (+/- 1 week) after initiating biologic as a part&#xD;
      of clinical standard of care treatment as described in this protocol. The visit will consist&#xD;
      of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood Tests (C-reactive, Albumin, Hematocrit, SOMAscan panel Week 14 Visit (+/- 2 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;

      consist of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical Exam Findings: Physical exam findings will be taken from the patient's clinical&#xD;
           care record from the most recent standard of care visit. If this data is not available&#xD;
           from the visit, the information will be obtained from the subject during a separate&#xD;
           visit to the clinic by the study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood Tests (C-reactive, Albumin, Hematocrit, SOMAscan panel&#xD;

&#xD;
      - Clinical assessment: Week 52 Visit (+/- 4 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 52 assessments will be done 52 weeks (+/- 4 weeks) after initiating biologic as a part&#xD;
      of clinical standard of care treatment as described in this protocol. The visit will consist&#xD;
      of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical Exam Findings: Physical exam findings will be taken from the patient's clinical&#xD;
           care record from the most recent standard of care visit. If this data is not available&#xD;
           from the visit, the information will be obtained from the subject during a separate&#xD;
           visit to the clinic by the study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiological Assessment: Radiological assessment will be performed on all patients as a&#xD;
           part of their clinical standard of care. Clinical read will be evaluated using the&#xD;
           assessment tool in Appendix B and guidance from Appendix A.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optional Endoscopic Assessment: Subjects can have additional endoscopic assessment as a&#xD;
           part of their standard of care treatment, and this report may be used for the study&#xD;
           assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease Progression Assessment: In order to assess the Disease Progression endpoint the&#xD;
           following will be assessed for the time point between the Week 16 Visit MRE and the Week&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Any hospitalization for disease flare or complications of the disease&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Need for surgery related to CD&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Need for rescue corticosteroids The treating gastroenterologists will be blinded to&#xD;
                the results of radiological TR although they will have access to the clinical read&#xD;
                in the electronic medical record.&#xD;
