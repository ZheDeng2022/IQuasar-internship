      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment outcomes for people with pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma are often poor. The&#xD;
      drug LMB-100 can attack and kill cancer cells. The drug pembrolizumab helps the immune system&#xD;
      fight cancer. Together, these drugs might help people with these cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test if pembrolizumab given after LMB-100 shrinks tumors in people with pleural or&#xD;
      peritoneal mesothelioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older with pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma that has not responded to&#xD;
      platinum-based therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor sample. Participants will have a biopsy if one is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood, heart, and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      X-rays and scans: Participants will lie on a table. A machine will take pictures of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive LMB-100 by IV on days 1, 3, and 5 of two 21-day cycles. They will&#xD;
      be observed for up to 2 hours after each infusion. They will receive drugs like Benadryl,&#xD;
      Tylenol, and Zantac to help with side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting with the 3rd cycle, participants will receive pembrolizumab by IV on day 1 of each&#xD;
      21-day cycle for up to 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have blood and urine tests, heart tests, and chest x-rays at least once per&#xD;
      cycle. They will have scans every 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may opt to provide tumor biopsies before starting the first cycle, after 2&#xD;
      cycles of LMB-100, and after 2 cycles of pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will a follow-up visit 4-6 weeks after their last drug dose of the study drug.&#xD;
      This includes blood and heart tests and scans. They may then have scans every 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted once a year for follow-up.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LMB-100, and a closely related immunotoxin, SS1P, also targeting mesothelin, have been&#xD;
           studied in previous Phase 1 clinical studies for mesothelioma and pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LMB-100 has demonstrated anti-tumor efficacy against several mesothelin expressing tumor&#xD;
           models including mesothelioma PDX models&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PD-1 (encoded by the gene Pdcd1) is an Ig superfamily member related to CD28 and CTLA-4&#xD;
           that has been shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of&#xD;
           its ligands&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The PD-1 receptor-ligand interaction is a major pathway hijacked by tumors to suppress&#xD;
           immune control. The normal function of PD-1, expressed on the cell surface of activated&#xD;
           T-cells under healthy conditions, is to down-modulate unwanted or excessive immune&#xD;
           responses, including autoimmune reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In immune-competent mice bearing human mesothelin expressing tumors local administration&#xD;
           of LMB-100 with CTLA-4 blockade eradicates murine tumors by promoting anti-cancer&#xD;
           immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LMB-100 treatment increase CD8+ T cell infiltration in murine lung adenocarcinoma tumors&#xD;
           that express human mesothelin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Combination treatment with LMB-100 plus anti-PD1 results in greater anti-tumor efficacy&#xD;
           in murine lung cancer model&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pembrolizumab is an anti PD-1 antibody that has demonstrated responses of long duration&#xD;
           in clinical trials and has generally been well-tolerated&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is hypothesized that the anti-mesothelin immunotoxin LMB-100 followed by&#xD;
           pembrolizumab will result in greater anti-tumor efficacy in patients with mesothelioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine the objective response rate of sequential therapy with LMB-100 followed by&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in subjects with pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histologically confirmed epithelial or biphasic pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma (with&#xD;
           &lt;50% sarcomatoid component) not amenable to potentially curative surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects must have at least one prior chemotherapy regimen that includes pemetrexed and&#xD;
           cisplatin or carboplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate organ and bone marrow function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior PD1/PD-L1 inhibitor treatment is prohibited&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chemotherapy within 4 weeks or radiotherapy within 2 weeks prior to start of study&#xD;
           therapy is prohibited.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects with active CNS metastasis are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects with active autoimmune disease for which they had received systemic treatment&#xD;
           during the previous 2 years receiving systemic glucocorticoids (excluding daily&#xD;
           glucocorticoid-replacement therapy for conditions such as adrenal or pituitary&#xD;
           insufficiency) are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects with active interstitial lung disease, or a history of pneumonitis for which&#xD;
           they had received glucocorticoids are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is an open-label, single center phase II study of LMB-100 followed by pembrolizumab&#xD;
           in subjects with advanced pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma who have progressed on&#xD;
           standard therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will receive LMB-100 at the single agent MTD on days 1, 3 and 5 of a 21-day&#xD;
           cycle for 2 cycles and pembrolizumab 200 mg on day 1 of each subsequent 21-day cycle&#xD;
           until disease progression (on or after pembrolizumab) or intolerable toxicity for a&#xD;
           maximum of 2 years (unless second course initiated).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor biopsies will be performed at baseline, at the end of cycle 2 and at the end of&#xD;
           cycle 4 to evaluate changes in the tumor immune microenvironment following treatment&#xD;
           with LMB-100 and pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 35 evaluable subjects will be enrolled&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has had a prior pneumonectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
             Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles,&#xD;
             mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus&#xD;
             Calmette-Guerin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection&#xD;
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza&#xD;
             vaccines (e.g., FluMist(R)) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy&#xD;
             (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of&#xD;
             immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to start of study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years&#xD;
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g.., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease(ILD) that&#xD;
             required steroids or has current pneumonitis/ILD&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject s&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A WOCBP who has a positive urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to start of&#xD;
             study therapy (see Appendix B). If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed&#xD;
             as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. Note: in the event that 72 hours&#xD;
             have elapsed between the screening pregnancy test and the first dose of study&#xD;
             treatment, another pregnancy test (urine or serum) must be performed and must be&#xD;
             negative in order for subject to start receiving study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the&#xD;
             projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 180 days&#xD;
             after the last dose of trial treatment. Pregnant women are excluded from this study&#xD;
             because LMB-100 + pembrolizumab are agents with the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with LMB-100 +&#xD;
