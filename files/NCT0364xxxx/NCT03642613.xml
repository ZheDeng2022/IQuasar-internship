      This study is conducted as a multicenter, non-interventional, cross-sectional study. Patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the study by a continuous registration method after patients provide&#xD;
      written informed consent. After providing informed consent, patients will answer the&#xD;
      questionnaires and start measurement with an accelerometer within four weeks. Activities will&#xD;
      be measured for 14 consecutive days.&#xD;

      This study is conducted as a multicenter, non-interventional, cross-sectional study. Patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the study by a continuous registration method after patients provide&#xD;
      written informed consent. After providing informed consent, patients will answer the&#xD;
      questionnaires and start measurement with an accelerometer within four weeks. Activities will&#xD;
      be measured for 14 consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;Objectives&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of factors relating to physical activity level in COPD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the number of daily steps in subgroups of COPD patients grouped according&#xD;
           to patient characteristics including lung functions, mMRC, and CAT scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Elucidation of impacts of factors associating PAL in COPD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Elucidating exploratorily the characteristics of the patients who are distributed&#xD;
           differently in each factor and analyzing patients' PAL further with their background.&#xD;
