    <textblock>
      Background: Many patients with peripheral artery disease are unable to achieve healthy&#xD;
      lifestyle after revascularization. There is evidence that rehabilitation program could result&#xD;
      in decreased re-admission, reduced cardiometabolic risk factors and improved quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: This first randomized controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of mobile phone text&#xD;
      message-based rehabilitation on low density lipoprotein (LDL), Ankle Brachial Index (ABI),&#xD;
      healthy lifestyle behaviors and quality of life for patients after revascularization.&#xD;
      Methods: This is a 6 months randomized controlled trial. It is hypothesized that&#xD;
      message-based rehabilitation program will be effective in improving the low density&#xD;
      lipoprotein (LDL), Ankle Brachial Index (ABI), healthy lifestyle behaviors and quality of&#xD;
      life for patients with peripheral artery disease after surgical revascularization. A total of&#xD;
      160 participants will be recruited for the study. The participants will be randomly divided&#xD;
      into intervention and control groups. Both intervention and control groups will receive&#xD;
      face-to-face lifestyle adherence counseling and booklet at baseline. The intervention group&#xD;
      will receive 4 mobile phone messages per week for 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to fill in the questionnaires at the baseline, 6-week and&#xD;
      6-month follow-up in Surgical Out Patient Department (SOPD). Participants' blood results of&#xD;
      low density lipoprotein (LDL) at the baseline and at 6-month follow-up will be retrieved from&#xD;
      Computer Management System in SOPD The primary outcomes are the fasting LDL levels at 6&#xD;
      months. Secondary outcome are Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI), BMI, Fasting glucose level, HDL&#xD;
      level, Total cholesterol level, self-reported adherence to healthy lifestyle behaviours,&#xD;
      quality of life and smoking status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: The target participants of this study are peripheral artery disease patients&#xD;
      who have received revascularization in the Surgical Department of a regional hospital in Hong&#xD;
      Kong. The eligible participants are Chinese, aged 50 years or above, and with medical record&#xD;
      of peripheral artery disease with revascularization done in the past 6 months. The&#xD;
      participants should be able to receive and read Chinese texts from their own mobile phones&#xD;
      and are available to come back for a 6-month follow-up for lifestyle counselling. The&#xD;
      potential participants will be excluded if they refuse to provide an informed-consent form or&#xD;
      if they have medical records stating their lack of capacity to provide informed consent. The&#xD;
      recruitment procedure will take place in Department of Surgery in a regional hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting: The study will be conducted in the Surgical Department of a regional hospital&#xD;
      in Hong Kong.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a circulatory disease which associated with&#xD;
      narrowing of arteries in the lower limbs. It is also a common atherosclerotic vascular&#xD;
      disease affecting 3-12% of the global population [1]. With aging of the global population and&#xD;
      increasing industrialization, PAD is expected to increase further in the next few decades.&#xD;
      Worse of all, PAD increases risk of coronary, cerebrovascular complication including death&#xD;
      [2]. So secondary prevention is essential for patients with PAD especially after&#xD;
      revascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is robust evidence that the secondary prevention of peripheral artery disease can be&#xD;
      achieved by lifestyle modification [3-4]. The American Heart Association (AHA) recommended&#xD;
      that smoking cessation, glycemic control and structured exercise are import elements of care&#xD;
      for patient with PAD [5]. Despite the need of secondary prevention and the evidence-based&#xD;
      guidelines from AHA, there is no structured rehabilitation program for PAD patients in Hong&#xD;
      Kong. Recent studies reported secondary prevention of PAD mainly focus on exercise and&#xD;
      medication therapy. However, a single lifestyle behavioral change could not address the needs&#xD;
      of the patients who have multiple lifestyle risk factors. Since many PAD patients have more&#xD;
      than one lifestyle risk factor, the rehabilitation program targeting multiple lifestyle&#xD;
      behavioral changes will be more benefit to the at risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mobile-rehabilitation is a new concept to deliver the rehabilitation program. Center-based&#xD;
      rehabilitation is well evidenced to reduce mortality, unplanned hospital admissions and&#xD;
      improve quality of life and psychological well-being of the patients [6]. However, its&#xD;
      benefits is limited by low referral rate and inaccessibility of program site [7]. Mobile&#xD;
      phone messaging can be used to motivate and reinforce the lifestyle behavioral changes. It&#xD;
      can also prevent patients from relapsing to the previous unhealthy lifestyle behavioral&#xD;
      stage. Current studies show a positive result of using texting to promote healthy lifestyle&#xD;
      behaviors among adults with cardiovascular disease [8-9]. Considering that the mobile-phone&#xD;
      penetration rate in Hong Kong is about 96.1% [10], the use of texting can be an innovative&#xD;
      and cost-effective tool to promote a healthy lifestyle and improve quality of life of PAD&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of the author's knowledge, there have been no Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)&#xD;
      of a stand-alone mobile phone message-based rehabilitation program designed to help&#xD;
      peripheral artery disease patients. This is the first randomized controlled trial to examine&#xD;
      the effectiveness of message-based rehabilitation on cardiometabolic risk factors for PAD&#xD;
      patients who have received surgical revascularization. The transtheorectical model (TTM) [11]&#xD;
      will be used as a framework for conceptualizing the process of behavior change. This model is&#xD;
      well-suited to this messaging-based intervention as it allows understanding of participants'&#xD;
      processes and dynamics of behavioral changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Aim This single-blinded randomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the message-based rehabilitation on fasting low density lipoprotein (LDL) level,&#xD;
      Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI), healthy lifestyle behaviours, quality of life and smoking status&#xD;
      for PAD patients who have received revascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Research hypothesis The research hypothesis is that the message-based rehabilitation&#xD;
      program improve the LDL, ABI and the cardiometabolic risk factors of peripheral artery&#xD;
      disease (PAD) patients who have received revascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Methodology 4.1 Study design This pilot randomised controlled trial aimed at examining the&#xD;
      effectiveness of message-based lifestyle intervention. Peripheral artery disease patients who&#xD;
      have received revascularization in the past 6 months, are randomized into 2 groups. The total&#xD;
      sample size will be 160. Both intervention and control groups will receive face-to-face&#xD;
      lifestyle adherence counseling and booklets at baseline. The intervention group will receive&#xD;
      4 mobile phone messages per week for 24 weeks. The messages are motivational advice to&#xD;
      support lifestyle behavioral modification in various stages of behavioral changes. All&#xD;
      participants will be follow up at 6-week and 6-month in Surgical Out Patient Department.&#xD;
      Participants' ABI, lifestyle behaviors and quality of life will be assessed at baseline, 6-&#xD;
      week and 6-month follow-up. Participants' fasting low density lipoprotein (LDL) level at&#xD;
      baseline and at 6-month follow up will be retrieved from Computer Management System with&#xD;
      approval of Dr. Leung Siu-kee, Chief Of Service Department of Surgery Tuen Mun Hospital. At&#xD;
      least ten participants from intervention group will be purposively selected for individual&#xD;
      face-to-face semi-structured interview to evaluate the mobile phone-based rehabilitation&#xD;
      program at 6-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 Study outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Fasting blood low density lipoprotein (LDL) level&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Smoking status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Readiness for behavioural changes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health related Quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-reported walking physical exercise (session per week)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-reported serving fruits and vegetables consumed per day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BMI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fasting glucose level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HDL level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total cholesterol level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ABI&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3 Study setting The study will be conducted in the Department of Surgery in Tuen Mun&#xD;
      Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4 Sampling method Probability sampling (simple random sampling) will be adopted for this&#xD;
      study. Simple individual randomization method by sequentially numbered, opaque sealed&#xD;
      envelopes (SNOSE) will be used to ensure the PI and participants will be concealed from the&#xD;
      allocation sequence. The trained research assistant will prepare 160 identical, opaque,&#xD;
      sealed, A5-sized envelops, with a unique 3-digit serial number on the cover of each envelope&#xD;
      as an identifier. Half of them will each contain a card indicating &quot;intervention&quot; and the&#xD;
      other half, &quot; control&quot;. After consent, the trained research assistant will open an envelope&#xD;
      according to the sequence of the serial number and assign participant to either&#xD;
      &quot;intervention&quot; or &quot;control&quot; group. The envelop must be opened according to the serial number.&#xD;
      All others will not know the group allocation before the envelope is opened. Frequent checks&#xD;
      (at least weekly) of these numbers will be done to ensure no deviation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.5 Sample size Sample size will be determined according to power (1-β), type 1 error (α),&#xD;
      and effect size. The mean effect size of lifestyle intervention from a previous study is 0.4,&#xD;
      which is a medium effect size according to Cohen 1998 [12]. Thus, an effect size of 0.4 was&#xD;
      used in the calculations. To achieve the conventional level of 80% power and α= 5%, the&#xD;
      sample size will be 128. The attrition rate in previous studies ranged from 16%-20%. A total&#xD;
      of 160 participants will ultimately be required; 80 participants will be randomized to either&#xD;
      intervention or control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.6 Study intervention The message-based lifestyle intervention consists of three parts. Both&#xD;
      the intervention and control groups will receive Parts I and II. Only the intervention group&#xD;
      will receive Part III, which is the mobile phone messaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I: Conduct an individualized healthy lifestyle education The first part is face-to-face&#xD;
      individual health education with supportive brief counselling. It consists of the&#xD;
      identification of lifestyle risk factors and modification strategies for secondary prevention&#xD;
      of PAD. This counselling service will be provided by Site Supervisor, Mr. Ng Hoi Wa. A&#xD;
      measurable and realistic lifestyle modification plan will be established together with the&#xD;
      client and the site supervisor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II: Develop a healthy lifestyle booklet The second part is a reinforcement tool for&#xD;
      face-to-face education. The research team will develop a booklet includes misconceptions,&#xD;
      maladaptive beliefs, facilitators and barriers of healthy lifestyle modification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part III: Perform mobile phone-based messaging The trained research assistant will deliver&#xD;
      the messages to the participants of the intervention group for 24 weeks throughout the study.&#xD;
      The messages will act as a reinforcement to increase self-awareness about health-promoting&#xD;
      behaviour and develop the desire for competence in achieving a healthy lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Data collection The quantitative data will be collected by using questionnaires. The&#xD;
      trained research assistant will explain the nature and purpose of the research to the&#xD;
      potential participants in interview room in Department of Surgery. The eligible participants&#xD;
      are requested to sign the informed-consent forms and reminded that their participation is&#xD;
      voluntary. The participants are also requested to fill in two questionnaires, Patient&#xD;
      Activation Measure [13] &amp; Short Form 12 version 2 (SF12v2) [14], at the baseline, 6-week and&#xD;
      6-month follow-up. The participants' blood result of fasting low density lipoprotein (LDL)&#xD;
      level will be retrieved from computer management system in Department of Surgery.&#xD;
      Face-to-face individual semi-structured interviews will be conducted to collect qualitative&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Data analysis Quantitative data will be analysed using International Business Machines&#xD;
      Corporation(IBM) Statistics is leading statistical software (SPSS) version 22.0 [15]. The&#xD;
      descriptive measures of all participants will be summarised by percentage, mean, and 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval (CI), as well as compared for between-group differences. The t-test will&#xD;
      be conduct to compare the differences in continuous variables between the intervention and&#xD;
      control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The qualitative data will be audio-recorded and analysed by thematic analysis. Seven&#xD;
      open-ended questions will be used in the semi-structured interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How do you feel about the mobile phone text message-based rehabilitation?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What factors encouraged you to participate in Peripheral Artery Disease Rehabilitation&#xD;
           program?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What factors discouraged you from participate in Peripheral Artery Disease&#xD;
           Rehabilitation program?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. How did the mobile phone text message-based rehabilitation facilitate your participation&#xD;
           in lifestyle modification?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. How easy did you find following the lifestyle advice from the mobile phone text message?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. How difficult did you find following the lifestyle advice from mobile phone text&#xD;
           message?&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Any suggestions on how to improve and promote the rehabilitation for patients with&#xD;
           peripheral artery disease?&#xD;
