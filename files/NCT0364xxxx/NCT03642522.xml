    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is identify biomarkers of response to repetitive transcranial&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in individuals with first episode or treatment resistant&#xD;
      depression. These biomarkers include simultaneous TMS-fMRI (functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging), a blood smear, cognitive and behavioural assessments, questionnaires, and&#xD;
      neurophysiology.&#xD;

      This study is enrolling 60 individuals with treatment-resistant depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive four weeks of 1-Hz rTMS to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex&#xD;
      (R_DLPFC). In addition, all patients will undergo baseline and post-treatment measures,&#xD;
      including rTMS while they are in the MRI scanner, neurophysiology (Electroencephalography&#xD;
      (EEG)/Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS)), cognitive testing, behavioural assessments and a&#xD;
      blood smear. There will also be a 1-week, 4-week, and 12-week follow-up following completion&#xD;
      of the treatment course.&#xD;

    <description>rTMS is a Health-Canada- and FDA-approved treatment for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), using focused magnetic field pulses to stimulate brain regions involved in emotion regulation, safely and non-invasively. rTMS can be applied at varying discharge frequencies which have differential effects on cortical excitability. At a low frequency (≤ 1Hz), rTMS reduces cortical excitability, while at frequencies greater than 1 Hz, rTMS facilitates cortical excitability3. In MDD, either high- frequency rTMS (HF-rTMS) applied over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) or low- frequency rTMS (LF-rTMS) applied over the right DLPFC have similar efficacy. This study utilizes low frequency rTMS to the right DLPFC.</description>
