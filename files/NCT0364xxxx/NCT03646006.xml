  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) is the most common major gynecologic surgery performed&#xD;
      in Canada. With a focus on minimally invasive techniques and optimization of peri-operative&#xD;
      pain control, gynaecologists have made great strides towards reducing hospital stay and&#xD;
      accelerating post-operative recovery. These are essential achievements, both for patients and&#xD;
      their families and for our resource-limited public healthcare system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optimization of peri-operative pain control is multifactorial and includes, for example,&#xD;
      administration of pre-operative analgesics, infiltration of incision sites with local&#xD;
      anesthetic and provision of post-operative pain medications. As the understanding of pain&#xD;
      mechanisms evolves, the incorporation of intra-operative nerve blocks has become yet another&#xD;
      effective strategy to reduce post-operative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presacral nerve plexus, which carries nerve fibers from the uterus to the brain, is an&#xD;
      important pathway that transmits midline pelvic pain in women. Destruction of the pre-sacral&#xD;
      nerves has been shown to provide excellent pain control in a variety of clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While transection of the presacral nerve at the time of surgery is technically challenging,&#xD;
      instilling a presacral nerve block is surprisingly straightforward making this technique safe&#xD;
      to perform in the hands of many gynecologists. In this technique, local anesthetic is&#xD;
      instilled into the presacral space using a needle inserted through the abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that the presacral nerve plexus is an integral pain pathway for the uterus, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that the addition of a presacral nerve block during laparoscopic&#xD;
      (camera surgery) hysterectomy would confer an additional reduction in immediate&#xD;
      post-operative pain. The proposed study therefore aims to look at the impact of presacral&#xD;
      nerve block versus a sham (blank) block on immediate post-operative pain in a group of women&#xD;
      scheduled to undergo laparoscopic hysterectomy.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a presacral nerve&#xD;
      block on post-operative pain following total laparoscopic hysterectomy. Given that the&#xD;
      presacral nerves carry pain sensation from the midline pelvic structures suggests that&#xD;
      blocking this important nerve pathway intra-operatively would provide an excellent&#xD;
      complementary method of analgesia in this patient population. Considering the frequency of&#xD;
      hysterectomy, further improvements in pain management with this simple additional step could&#xD;
      offer great benefits for patients and for the healthcare system by minimizing narcotic&#xD;
      consumption, hospital stay, recovery time and time away from work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a single-center parallel group randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the&#xD;
      administration of a presacral nerve block using 10 millilitres (mL) of local bupivacaine (5&#xD;
      milligrams [mg]/ml) versus 10 mL of normal saline (sham block). Participants will be selected&#xD;
      using a convenience sample from Mount Sinai Hospital's outpatient gynecology clinics. All&#xD;
      women undergoing total laparoscopic hysterectomy will be considered for this study. Baseline&#xD;
      characteristics, including age, gravity, parity, medical history, surgical history, body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI) and indication for surgery will be collected on all study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be randomized on the day of surgery. The investigators will create a&#xD;
      randomization list using a computer-generated allocation sequence in equal ratio. The&#xD;
      investigators will place the drug/placebo designation in numbered opaque envelopes and secure&#xD;
      the envelope to the patient's chart on the day of surgery. The randomization number will&#xD;
      correspond to a pre-filled syringe (containing either drug or placebo) that will be labelled&#xD;
      with the randomization number only. A list of syringe numbers and corresponding group&#xD;
      allocation will be kept on a secured server and will not be visible to the surgeon or study&#xD;
      personnel. The surgeon will complete the laparoscopic hysterectomy according to his/her&#xD;
      preferred operative technique. After the hysterectomy is completed, and prior to desufflating&#xD;
      the abdomen, the surgeon will be presented with study drug (bupivicaine/placebo) loaded in a&#xD;
      syringe with a spinal needle. The surgeon will laparoscopically instill the drug/placebo into&#xD;
      the presacral space after confirming hemostasis as the final step before closing the abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgeon, research team, participants and data analysts will be blinded to treatment&#xD;
      group. Participants will receive standard perioperative care including induction/maintenance&#xD;
      of general anesthesia and prevention/treatment of post-operative nausea, vomiting and pain.&#xD;
      Following surgery, patients will complete a self-administered visual analogue scale [VAS] for&#xD;
      pain at 1-, 2- and 3-hours after surgery (primary outcome). In addition, the investigators&#xD;
      will calculate total narcotic and anti-emetic consumption prior to discharge and report on&#xD;
      any adverse events (secondary outcomes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be early post-operative pain measured at 3-hours following surgery&#xD;
      by a self-administered VAS for pain. Secondary outcome measures will include: (a) pain&#xD;
      measured at 1- and 2-hours following surgery by a self-administered VAS for pain (b) total&#xD;
      narcotics administered from end of surgery until discharge and (c) adverse&#xD;
      effects/complication rates. The following will also be collected: estimated blood loss;&#xD;
      operative time; total length of stay in post-anaesthesia recovery unit (PACU) prior to&#xD;
      discharge; time to first void after surgery; and time to first ambulation after surgery. Due&#xD;
      to the short follow up period for the majority of data collection, the investigators&#xD;
      anticipate near 100% retention of study subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on a sample-size calculation to detect a 30% reduction in self-reported pain using a&#xD;
      VAS for pain (with alpha 0.05 and power 0.9) the study will require 30 patients per group.&#xD;
      With a conservative estimate of 5 total laparoscopic hysterectomies per week, the&#xD;
      investigators expect to surpass this target within 6 months of starting our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Success of the intervention will be assessed by comparing primary and secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures between the two treatment arms using an independent student T-test (Î± = 0.05) for&#xD;
      continuous variables and expressed as the difference between means with accompanying 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals.&#xD;
