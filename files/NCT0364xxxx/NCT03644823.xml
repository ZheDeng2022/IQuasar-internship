  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will investigate toxicity in patients treated with a&#xD;
      Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor and radiotherapy. Patients with advanced&#xD;
      Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) can be included when treatment with a PD-1 inhibitor is&#xD;
      indicated according to national guidelines. Included patients will receive stereotactic&#xD;
      radiotherapy to one or two tumour lesion(s) in addition to the PD-1 inhibitor, and toxicity&#xD;
      is the primary endpoint.&#xD;

      This phase II study will investigate NSCLC patients (stage III-IV, palliative treated) where&#xD;
      treatment with a PD1-inhibitor is indicated according to national guidelines. Patients will&#xD;
      be treated with a check-point inhibitor combined with radiotherapy (6 Gy x 3) towards lesions&#xD;
      (1-2). Atezolizumab is available and reimbursed in the public health system. The radiotherapy&#xD;
      dosing is significantly lower than standard stereotactic radiotherapy, and is in accordance&#xD;
      with other studies reported in ClinicalTrials.gov. Such a fractionation will putatively&#xD;
      induce immunogenic cell death, while being a safe treatment, not likely to induce significant&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whereas the primary endpoint in our clinical study will be toxicity, the secondary endpoints&#xD;
      include response rates, overall survival, safety and tolerability, quality of life,&#xD;
      progression-free survival and duration of response. In addition, exploratory endpoints will&#xD;
      include immunological response, tumor evolution and dynamics in the tumor microenvironment&#xD;
      during treatment, imaging, and biomarkers of clinical response.&#xD;
