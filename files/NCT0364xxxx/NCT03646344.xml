  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Organ shortage for transplant has necessitated use of kidneys from older donors, increasing&#xD;
      the chance that the kidney will not work immediately or for as long as expected. The&#xD;
      investigators gave the drug heme arginate (HA) to 20 kidney transplant patients in the first&#xD;
      24 hours after transplant, and showed that it may reduce kidney injury and is safe. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to conduct a large study recruiting 600 patients to determine whether HA&#xD;
      treatment increases the number of kidney transplants that work immediately. If successful, HA&#xD;
      may be introduced into clinical practice at the end of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be invited to take part in the study once listed for a kidney transplant.&#xD;
      Further discussions will be had with them when admitted for transplant, and they will be&#xD;
      offered the opportunity to participate. Consent will not be taken until the patient is&#xD;
      admitted for transplantation. Following consent, participants will be randomised to receive&#xD;
      either 2 doses of the study drug, HA, or a salt water solution, one at the time of&#xD;
      transplant, and one approximately 24 hours later. Otherwise, treatment will be the same as&#xD;
      any other patient undergoing a kidney transplant. Information about recovery from surgery,&#xD;
      and specifically about kidney function, will be collected, but will not require additional&#xD;
      blood tests. The study period ends after the first 7 days post-transplant, although longer&#xD;
      term data will be collected from routine follow up appointments. Participants will be asked&#xD;
      to complete a simple quality of life questionnaire 3 times: just before transplant, at&#xD;
      approximately one week and three months after transplant.&#xD;
