  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are a family of closely related lung conditions&#xD;
      characterized by alveolar inflammation, injury, and fibrosis not due to infection or&#xD;
      neoplasia. While previously considered to be rare, a recent nationwide study found that&#xD;
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a fibrotic ILD with a median survival of only 3.8 years,&#xD;
      affects nearly 0.5% of older adults in the U.S. While pirfenidone and nintedanib slow the&#xD;
      progression of IPF, neither reverses fibrosis nor prevents progression of the disease,and no&#xD;
      studies to date have tested interventions that prevent the development of fibrotic ILDs.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The NHLBI has prioritized research focused on the primary prevention of chronic lung&#xD;
      diseases, including ILD. The overall goal of this study is to conduct studies preparatory to&#xD;
      and requisite for the testing of ILD preventative interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study, the investigators propose to examine the pulmonary histopathology and&#xD;
      biology of early subclinical ILD in healthy adults with a first-degree relative with&#xD;
      clinically diagnosed ILD. There are two currently accepted computed tomographic (CT)-based&#xD;
      phenotypes of subclinical ILD: high attenuation areas (HAAs) and interstitial lung&#xD;
      abnormalities (ILA). Investigators from Columbia University Medical Center have previously&#xD;
      shown that HAA has strong construct validity as an imaging biomarker of early subclinical&#xD;
      alveolar inflammation and fibrosis among community-dwelling adults using the Multi-Ethnic&#xD;
      Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), an ongoing NHLBI-funded prospective cohort study of 6,814&#xD;
      adults age 45 and older at enrollment in 2000-02. Investigators found that greater HAA at&#xD;
      baseline was independently associated with reduced lung function and exercise capacity at&#xD;
      5-year follow-up, exertional dyspnea at 10-year follow-up, and elevated serum levels of&#xD;
      matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). ILA is a distinct qualitative&#xD;
      and visually-identified early ILD phenotype on CT that has also shown strong construct&#xD;
      validity for ILD. Neither HAA nor ILA has been validated histopathologically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lipoprotein substudy will examine the role of high density lipoproteins in patients with&#xD;
      ILD. Patients with IPF have previously been shown to have low levels of high density&#xD;
      lipoprotein (HDL) and high levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL). Investigators have&#xD;
      previously shown that high levels of high-density cholesterol (HDL-C) are associated with a&#xD;
      reduction in lung injury, inflammation and fibrosis (subclinical ILD) on CT in&#xD;
      community-dwelling adults enrolled in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. These data&#xD;
      are consistent with animal model data showing that treatment with apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I;&#xD;
      the main component of HDL) attenuates lung fibrosis. Investigators at Columbia University&#xD;
      Medical Center are therefore proposing to examine the associations of HDL and its main&#xD;
      components (apolipoprotein A-I, apolipoprotein A-II, and paraoxonase-1) with clinical&#xD;
      outcomes (FVC decline, death, lung transplantation and respiratory hospitalizations) and&#xD;
      serum biomarkers of lung injury, inflammation and remodeling (SP-A, MMP-7, ICAM-1, IL-1,&#xD;
      IL-18) in patients with ILD. Investigators will also explore the structure (using&#xD;
      quantitative proteomics) and function (using a macrophage efflux assay and paraoxonase-1&#xD;
      activity assay) of HDL particles in adults with ILD and first-degree family members with&#xD;
      subclinical ILD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is highly prevalent among adults with interstitial lung disease&#xD;
      (ILD) and maybe a risk factor based on our previous studies from MESA&#xD;
      (https://www.mesa-nhlbi.org/) and other research studies completed at Columbia University&#xD;
      Medical Center. Therefore, the investigators will examine the association between OSA and&#xD;
      sub-clinical ILD in at-risk adults.&#xD;
