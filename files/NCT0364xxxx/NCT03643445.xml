    <textblock>
      1. Study Objectives To evaluate changes in general symptomatology in patients undergoing&#xD;
           the day hospital eating disorders program at North York General Hospital and compare&#xD;
           symptoms between treatment groups (motivation-oriented vs. psychoeducation-oriented).&#xD;
&#xD;
           To determine treatment satisfaction ratings in patients undergoing the day hospital&#xD;
           program and compare satisfaction between treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To evaluate the acceptability of patient-centered and motivation-oriented eating&#xD;
           disorder treatment among patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who receive motivation-oriented adjunctive treatment will experience larger&#xD;
      improvements in eating disorder symptomatology 6 weeks into treatment, 10-12 weeks into&#xD;
      treatment, and at discharge (compared to admission), and as compared to those receiving&#xD;
      psychoeducation-oriented adjunctive treatment. Patients who receive motivation-oriented&#xD;
      adjunctive treatment will report higher satisfaction with treatment, stronger feelings of&#xD;
      motivation to recover, and will be more likely to complete the program as compared to those&#xD;
      receiving psychoeducation-oriented adjunctive treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Adult Eating Disorders Day Hospital Program at NYGH treats patients with a diagnosis of&#xD;
      an eating disorder, including anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and other specified feeding&#xD;
      and eating disorder. As with all intensive eating disorder treatment programs, relapse and&#xD;
      drop-out are common occurrences. These outcomes are understood to occur when a patient is not&#xD;
      ready to commit to the behavioural changes that are required for recovery, including&#xD;
      normalized eating and abstinence from extreme food restriction, and bingeing and purging&#xD;
      symptoms. Many patients struggle while they are in treatment for an eating disorder,&#xD;
      demonstrating continued dietary restriction or urges to have symptoms like bingeing and&#xD;
      purging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are interested in examining whether modifications to the way in which the&#xD;
      NYGH adult eating disorders program addresses motivation among patients will improve the&#xD;
      quality, efficiency, and outcome of care. This study will compare two psychosocial adjunctive&#xD;
      treatments during the standard hospital-based day treatment: one that focuses on patients'&#xD;
      motivation to recover (motivational interviewing; MI) and the other that focuses on teaching&#xD;
      patients about eating disorders and their associated risks (psychoeducation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed by previous findings that a brief pre-treatment of MI can sometimes reduce treatment&#xD;
      drop-out from intensive ED treatment, the current study aims to understand the effectiveness&#xD;
      of motivation-oriented treatment for eating disorders. Based on previous research, if a&#xD;
      patient is encouraged to reflect on and resolve obstacles to their readiness to change&#xD;
      throughout the course of treatment, the researchers believe that objective treatment outcomes&#xD;
      will improve alongside positive shifts in personal agency and confidence in one's ability to&#xD;
      get better. Therefore, in addition to examining treatment completion and symptom improvement&#xD;
      (as assessed by the standard questionnaires given to patients as part of program evaluation),&#xD;
      the researchers will examine other psychological indicators of improvement that previous&#xD;
      research has shown are important to consider in recovery, including treatment outcome&#xD;
      expectancy (i.e., whether a patient feels confident that they can get better) as well as&#xD;
      satisfaction with treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of two groups: patients will be randomly assigned to either&#xD;
      motivation-oriented treatment or psychoeducation-oriented treatment. The researchers will&#xD;
      include the fairly comprehensive package of outcome measures already administered to patients&#xD;
      in this program to ensure that the researchers are looking at overall symptomatology in&#xD;
      patients, as well as processes that could be expected to mediate outcome, such as patients'&#xD;
      treatment outcome expectancies. The researchers will compare means on all measures between&#xD;
      groups from pre-, mid- and end-of-treatment. The researchers believe that results from this&#xD;
      study will add to the growing body of literature demonstrating the therapeutic benefit for&#xD;
      motivation-oriented treatments for eating disorders and could assist the treatment team at&#xD;
      NYGH and other hospitals with treatment planning.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Eating disorder participants will be randomly assigned either the motivation-oriented treatment condition or the psychoeducation-oriented treatment condition. Patients in both groups will receive the same care in terms of their hospital treatment and opportunities for interaction with the staff. The only difference will be that for Â½ of participants, their treatment will be infused with motivation-oriented interventions. For the others, their interactions will be infused with psychoeducation-oriented interventions. All patients have interactions with an individual therapist at various time points in their hospital treatment. The points at which a patient meets with his or her individual therapist are as follows: at the orientation to the program, a 6-week check-in, and a 10-12 week check-in. As well, patients typically meet with their individual therapist whenever the treatment team determines that a patient may be struggling in the program and is at risk of premature drop-out.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Motivational interviewing is a psychotherapeutic stance aimed at helping patients in resolving ambivalence toward change and increasing their intrinsic motivation to engage in healthy behaviour choices. Patients assigned to these MI-trained therapists will be in the motivation-oriented condition. All individual meetings patients have with their therapist while they are in the program will entail sessions that are guided by MI principles. That is, revisiting patients' motivation to recover and overcoming obstacles to ambivalence or low motivation.</description>

    <description>The psychoeducation-oriented treatment condition is intended to teach patients about the causes of eating disorders, the expected course of recovery, obstacles to recovery, and the importance of behavioural changes required for recovery from an eating disorder. Two staff members in the eating disorders program will deliver the psychoeducation-infused interventions, which are intended to be equivalent to treatment-as-usual in many eating disorder programs, but in a structured and standardized way, and with the use of the self-help manual. Psychoeducation is a very common intervention, often used as part of cognitive-behavioural treatment for eating disorders. The idea is that information about eating disorders and their health risks facilitates recovery and allows patients to &quot;buy in&quot; to treatment.</description>

    <description>The motivation-oriented treatment condition is intended to create a context for treatment that is patient-centered, non-judgmental, and will create a therapeutic environment wherein patients can make an informed decision around their goals for treatment and their willingness to commit to the behavioural changes required for recovery from an eating disorder. In general, MI is a psychotherapeutic stance aimed at helping patients in resolving ambivalence toward change and increasing their intrinsic motivation to engage in healthy behaviour choices.</description>

    <description>The psychoeducation-oriented treatment condition is intended to teach patients about the causes of eating disorders, the expected course of recovery, obstacles to recovery, and the importance of behavioural changes required for recovery from an eating disorder. In this condition, in order to maximize the differences between groups, no attention will be given to discussing the patient's stage of change, their level of motivation, or their own personal values around recovery. Rather, emphasis during individual meetings with their therapist will be on the importance of symptom abstinence and normal eating.</description>
