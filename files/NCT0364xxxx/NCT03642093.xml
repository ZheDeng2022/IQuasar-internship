  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A one-group prospective cohort study design with measures collected pre- and&#xD;
      post-intervention. The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the effect of a multimodal&#xD;
      prehabilitation preoperative program on changes in frailty in upper gastrointestinal surgical&#xD;
      oncology patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer patients often develop protein calorie malnutrition, inflammatory states, and loss of&#xD;
      lean muscle mass, which can be best categorized as frailty. Frailty affects global health,&#xD;
      the ability to carry out normal functions, and even the ability to tolerate targeted curative&#xD;
      treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. The Investigators evaluate frailty,&#xD;
      and design a study to evaluate the outcomes of the administration of multimodal preoperative&#xD;
      prehabilitation programs on those frailty markers. Previous data provides support for&#xD;
      interventions that include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Improved protein rich nutrition with specific immunonutrition recommendations,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment of maldigestion or pancreatic insufficiency in pancreatic, gastric, or&#xD;
           esophageal cancer patients,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Brief, evidence-based activity interventions such as walking and inspiratory muscle&#xD;
           training (IMT), and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Disease specific education&#xD;
&#xD;
      These interventions should improve frailty by maintaining or regaining weight, improved grip&#xD;
      strength, and improved prealbumin. These markers indicate improvements in nutritional status,&#xD;
      increased strength and ability to ambulate, and improved functional status in the&#xD;
      preoperative period. Other outcomes that will be reported include fat-soluble vitamin levels,&#xD;
      global health, and inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preoperative period is the best time to facilitate patient engagement through self-care&#xD;
      and proactive activity. Interventions must be easy to accomplish and structured so patients&#xD;
      have accountability and both patients and clinicians have methods and tools for measuring&#xD;
      progress. Most patients and family members are motivated at this time and understand the need&#xD;
      to improve frailty and potentially improve global health.&#xD;
