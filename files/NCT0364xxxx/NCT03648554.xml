  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GLP-1 analogues represent new treatments in diabetes that cause weight loss. Their effect on&#xD;
      NASH in humans is unknown. A decrease in Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) has been reported in&#xD;
      pooled Exenatide/Placebo and Liraglutide/Placebo studies. More recently, LEAN study has shown&#xD;
      that Liraglutide will result in improvements in liver histology in patients with NASH. It&#xD;
      should be of high interest to investigate the effect of another GLP-1 Agonist as effective as&#xD;
      Liraglutide, i.e. Dulaglutide in NASH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dulaglutide is one of the five GLP-1 receptor agonists approved for type 2 diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      (T2DM). It is an effective treatment because it is dosed once-weekly, provides HbA1c&#xD;
      reduction similar to Liraglutide, weight reduction similar to Exenatide, and has an adverse&#xD;
      effect profile similar to other GLP-1 receptor agonists. Reduction in body weight was&#xD;
      observed in patients treated with Dulaglutide, irrespective of nausea and/or vomiting.The&#xD;
      search for a direct effect of Dulaglutide on liver fat overload in patients with type2&#xD;
      diabetes is required before considering the effectiveness of this treatment in NASH in&#xD;
      diabetic populations. No current GLP-1 study has been designed with a control group with the&#xD;
      same weight loss than as in the treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: The investigators aim to study the effect of Dulaglutide 1.5 mg&#xD;
      (TRULICITY®) add-on to dietary reinforcement after 52 weeks of treatment, on the improvement&#xD;
      of liver histology compared to dietary reinforcement alone in patients with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      and carriers of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After 52 weeks of treatment, to assess the effect of dulaglutide (TRULICITY®) add-on to&#xD;
           dietary reinforcement on Fibrosis score, Transaminase levels, body composition as&#xD;
           measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, lipid profile, glycemic control and&#xD;
           weight. The effect of the treatment will also be assessed on quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At 24 weeks after completion of the treatment, to assess the sustainability of&#xD;
           dulaglutide (TRULICITY®) treatment add-on to dietary reinforcement on ALT and AST rates&#xD;
           as well as on weight.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, open, prospective, randomized, controlled dietary reinforcement study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Group: dulaglutide (TRULICITY®) subcutaneous administration, one weekly&#xD;
           injection, in a dose of 1.5 mg of dulaglutide in combinaison with reinforced dietary&#xD;
           monitoring as same as control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group: reinforced dietary monitoring with frequent dietary consultations, based&#xD;
           on AHA recommendations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients are monitored in the same way for dietary reinforcement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted over the course of 80 weeks in 3 periods (13 visits):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Period I: Run-in phase of 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Period II: Treatment phase of 52 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Period III: Follow-up phase of 24 weeks. The patient must return to the study centre to&#xD;
           assess whether the response to treatment is time-dependent.&#xD;

    <description>Quality of Life, Obesity and Diet Scale (QOLOD rating scale questionnaire).Items were grouped in 5 dimensions: physical impact, psycho-social impact, sexual impact, comfort with food, diet experience. Each item of the QOLOD questionnaire was graded from 1 to 5 (1: always/enormously; 2: often/a lot; 3: sometimes/moderately; 4: rarely/a little; 5: never/not at all). score was then calculated for each dimension by adding together its constituent items. Scores obtained by adding up answers graded from 1 to 5 of all items per dimension were transformed to convert the lowest and highest score possible to 0 and 100 respectively. Hence the higher the score, the better the quality of life.</description>
