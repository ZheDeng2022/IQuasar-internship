  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many pregnant women suffer from poor sleep quality and snoring. Evidence shows an increasing&#xD;
      association between (1) sleep disordered breathing and (2) maternal cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      and in-hospital death. Snoring is a variant of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and OSA during&#xD;
      pregnancy is associated with higher risks for cesarean delivery, gestational hypertension,&#xD;
      preeclampsia and preterm delivery. It may also impact fetal outcomes negatively. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to determine whether sleep quality can be improved in pregnant women who&#xD;
      snore by means of an oral appliance that opens the airway. Sleep quality is evaluated&#xD;
      objectively using an un-intrusive home sleep test system.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      As many as 20 percent of women suffer from snoring and poor sleep quality while pregnant. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to determine whether sleep can be improved in pregnant women who&#xD;
      snore by means of a midline traction oral appliance (OA) that opens the airway. This is an&#xD;
      interventional study to objectively evaluate OA therapy on breathing during sleep as well as&#xD;
      its effect on sleep quality. Pregnant women from all trimesters will be recruited. Each&#xD;
      subject is expected to participate in the study for at least five (5) consecutive weeks. Home&#xD;
      sleep recordings will be collected at three time points: T0 - Baseline prior to OA use for&#xD;
      two consecutive nights; T1- first two consecutive nights wearing the OA; T2 - for two&#xD;
      consecutive nights after 4 weeks of appliance use. In addition to the sleep studies performed&#xD;
      at each of these time points, subjects will also complete several brief surveys. All&#xD;
      participants will be given the opportunity to use their OAs after the 4 week period, and have&#xD;
      their sleep recorded at 8 week intervals through the remainder of their pregnancies.&#xD;
      Participants will get to keep and use their OAs after the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women who snore (or otherwise have poor sleep), may qualify to participate in this&#xD;
      study. Those who do not want to wear an oral appliance, but are interested in learning about&#xD;
      sleep quality while pregnant, may also qualify to participate as a control subject.&#xD;
