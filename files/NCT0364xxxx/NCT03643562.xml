  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was amended from extended access to a clinical trial. Information will be&#xD;
      collected about long-term safety and effectiveness of adrabetadex shots in the spine every 2&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who were already taking adrabetadex will receive their stable dose. Participants&#xD;
      who have not ever taken it will start by receiving 400 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design will be like the expanded access by Rush University, but for children at&#xD;
      least 4 years of age at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive treatment every 2 weeks until their doctor finds it does not help&#xD;
      them anymore, they withdraw, or the study is stopped for any reason. Participants will not&#xD;
      receive additional study treatment after their participation in this protocol.&#xD;
