      The aim of this study is to explore how gender dysphoria is experienced among adolescents&#xD;
      aged 13 - 18 from a clinical population. The method is qualitative, with a phenomenological&#xD;
      approach. Qualitative in-depth data on how gender dysphoria is experienced by the adolescents&#xD;
      themselves is lacking in the research literature. As a consequence the within perspective&#xD;
      from the clients is lacking. In addition, one aim is to help develop further hypothesis and&#xD;
      clinical theory and rationale.&#xD;

      For some children and adolescents their ascribed gender at birth do not match with their&#xD;
      gender expression or how they identify later in life. If the mismatch between ascribed gender&#xD;
      at birth and gender identity and expression and how the body looks like is associated With&#xD;
      distress or discomfort of any kind, this is referred to as gender dysphoria in the Research&#xD;
      literature and DSM-V (DSM-V, 2014; Kreukels et al., 2012; Wren, 2014). After initial attempts&#xD;
      with so called reparative therapy at changing clients' gender identity in accordance with&#xD;
      their ascribed gender at birth, sex reassignment became the treatment of choice to gender&#xD;
      dysphoria (Wierckx et al., 2014; Wren, 2014). Since the advent of sophisticated physical&#xD;
      treatment like hormonal therapy and surgical techniques, capable of removing certain&#xD;
      characteristics of the sexual body, an increasing number of clinics globally have started to&#xD;
      offer puberty suppression to pubertal adolescents with gender dysphoria, in order to allow&#xD;
      more time before making decisions regarding gender identity. This is referred to as the Dutch&#xD;
      model, and the clinical aim is to reduce the pressure the youth are experiencing when the&#xD;
      body is developing in a way that creates a lot of distress. Many countries have established&#xD;
      special clinics, which focus on development of treatment programs, and there has been a steep&#xD;
      increase in number of referrals the last years (Kaltiala-Heino, Sumia, Työläjärvi, &amp;&#xD;
      Lindberg, 2015). In Norway, 450 clients were referred to the Norwegian National Unit for&#xD;
      Gender Dysphoria and Transsexualism (Nasjonal behandlingstjeneste for transseksualisme, NBTS)&#xD;
      in 2016. Half of them were under 18, and the number has been multiplied the last years&#xD;
      (Nasjonal behandlingstjeneste for transseksualisme, årsrapport 2016). However, clinical&#xD;
      treatment has been initiated without clarifying what gender dysphoria is, how it is&#xD;
      experienced by those suffering from it and how it should be understood theoretically. A&#xD;
      common concern in the research literature and among clinicians has been that important&#xD;
      medical interventions have been utilized while the understanding of gender dysphoria among&#xD;
      adolescents and Young adults and its psychological implications could be better understood&#xD;
      (Kaltiala-Heino et al., 2015; Wren, 2014). In addition, activists and clients have claimed&#xD;
      that their perspectives have been overseen by researchers and clinicians (Wren, 2014).&#xD;
      Furthermore, there has been increased attention toward gender dysphoria both nationally and&#xD;
      internationally. The aim of this project is to do an interview study in collaboration with&#xD;
      chief physician at the NBTS, Ira Haraldsen and a reference group with former clients, in&#xD;
      order to produce knowledge on how clients between the ages of 13 and 18 years that are being&#xD;
      treated at the NBTS experience the gender dysphoria, how they understand the condition and&#xD;
      make sense of their experiences and how it affects their lives. Much of the research on&#xD;
      gender dysphoria has been quantitative, based on self report from the clients themselves or&#xD;
      reports from health professionals (Drescher &amp; Byne, 2012). This means that the research has&#xD;
      focused on predictors of good outcome, and delivered important knowledge on the treatment of&#xD;
      gender dysphoria. However, there has not been done much research on the psychological nature&#xD;
      of gender dysphoria, what psychosocial consequences this has for the development of gender&#xD;
      identity and identity in general and how this is experienced by the young people themselves.&#xD;
      There is also a lack of theoretical incorporation of gender dysphoria within the clinical and&#xD;
      developmental psychological literature, and a psychological approach to it. Furthermore,&#xD;
      studies on the outcome of puberty suppression and sex reassignment have demonstrated that&#xD;
      although many adolescents improve mentally after transitioning into an other gender and&#xD;
      gender dysphoria ameliorate, many are still suffering from severe psychiatric conditions and&#xD;
      psychosocial adjustment (Kaltiala-Heinoet al., 2015). Studies have also demonstrated that&#xD;
      adolescents undergoing this treatment is in need of psychological monitoring, but the&#xD;
      research on how this should be implemented is lacking (de Vries et al., 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NBTS has been at the forefront internationally implementing the Dutch model. The plan is to&#xD;
      interview participants that have been referred to NBTS, consisting of clients that are in&#xD;
      different phases of the treatment. The methodological approach will be qualitative and&#xD;
      phenomenological, aiming to shed light on how gender dysphoria is experienced subjectively,&#xD;
      and focusing on the diversity of presentations rather than searching for general principles.&#xD;
      An other important aim is to contribute to theory development, drawing on clinical&#xD;
      psychological theories as well as biological and medical knowledge and concepts from gender&#xD;
      studies. In relation to this, an aim is to generate hypothesis and stimulate further studies.&#xD;
      The collaboration between NBTS and the reference group is an opportunity to fill a gap in the&#xD;
      international research between clients and activists one the one hand and researchers and&#xD;
      clinicians on the other, and contribute to improved understanding of adolescents suffering&#xD;
      from gender dysphoria and how clinicians can help them. This is in line with Standards of&#xD;
      Care, the recommendations for treatment of gender dysphoria published by the World&#xD;
      Professional Association for Transgender Health. According to this report, the perspectives&#xD;
      of people having gender dysphoria are essential to ensure good health care, given the&#xD;
      discrimination many are experiencing. Besides, in 2015, the Norwegian Directorate of Health&#xD;
      published a report on the health services offered to people with gender dysphoria, named Rett&#xD;
      til rett kjønn - helse til alle kjønn, based on the work of an expert group consisting of&#xD;
      clinicians, activist and clients. The report concludes that there is a need to do more&#xD;
      Research on how gender dysphoria is experienced and what consequences it has for young People&#xD;
      living with it. Furthermore, the expert group concludes that there is a need for increased&#xD;
      knowledge and awareness of gender dysphoria and how young people living with it should be&#xD;
      helped among health professionals working in both specialist and primary health care.&#xD;
