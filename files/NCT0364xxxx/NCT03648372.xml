  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is in 2 parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aims of the 1st part of the study are to check if people with advanced solid tumors&#xD;
      or cancers in the immune system (lymphomas) have side effects from TAK-981, and to check how&#xD;
      much TAK-981 they can receive without getting side effects from it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aims of the 2nd part of the study are to learn if the condition of people with&#xD;
      specific cancers improves after treatment with TAK-981. Another aim is to check for side&#xD;
      effects from TAK-981.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the 1st part of the study, participants will receive TAK-981. In the 2nd part of the&#xD;
      study, participants with specific tumor types will receive TAK-981 at the recommended phase 2&#xD;
      dose determined during the 1st part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both parts of the study, participants can receive TAK-981 for up to 1 year or longer if&#xD;
      their condition stays improved.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-981. TAK-981 is being tested to evaluate&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy and PK in participants with advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      solid tumors or relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies. The study will include 2&#xD;
      phases: Phase 1 dose escalation and Phase 2 dose expansion cohorts (cancer treatment&#xD;
      expansions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 202 participants, approximately 70 participants in the&#xD;
      dose escalation phase, approximately 132 participants in cancer treatment expansion phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the dose escalation, dose levels will be escalated based on safety, and available PK and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic data and will also determine the single agent RP2D. Participants in dose&#xD;
      expansion phase will be enrolled, once RP2D is determined. There will be 6 cohorts in cancer&#xD;
      treatment expansions as following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort A: Nonsquamous NSCLC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort B: Cervical cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort C: MSS-CRC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort D: Relapsed/refractory DLBCL progressed or relapsed after CAR T-cells therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort E: Relapsed/refractory DLBCL that have not received prior cellular therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort F: Relapsed/refractory FL&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States and Canada. The overall time&#xD;
      to participate in this study is approximately 4 years. The overall time to receive treatment&#xD;
      in the dose escalation and cancer treatment is approximately 1 year. Based on decision of&#xD;
      sponsor, participants with demonstrated clinical benefit can continue treatment beyond 1&#xD;
      year. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and will make a final visit 30&#xD;
      days after receiving their last dose of drug or before the start of subsequent anticancer&#xD;
      therapy, whichever occurs first for a follow-up assessment.&#xD;

                  recurrent not amenable to curative therapy) or metastatic solid tumors who have&#xD;

             adenocarcinoma of the cervix) participants who have received no more than 1 prior&#xD;
             systemic line of therapy for recurrent or Stage IVB cervical cancer (cohort B).&#xD;

             Note: The following cervical tumors are not eligible: minimal deviation/adenoma&#xD;
             malignum, gastric-type adenocarcinoma, clear-cell carcinoma, and mesonephric&#xD;
             carcinoma. Histologic confirmation of the original primary tumor is required via&#xD;
             pathology report.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: First-line treatment must have consisted of platinum-containing doublet.&#xD;
             Chemotherapy administered concurrently with primary radiation (example- weekly&#xD;
             cisplatin) is not counted as a systemic chemotherapy regimen.&#xD;

                  that has received approval by a health authority for the treatment of DLBCL&#xD;
                  (cohort D).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Relapsed/refractory DLBCL that has progressed or relapsed after at least 2 but no&#xD;
                  more than 3 prior lines of systemic therapy and has not received prior cellular&#xD;
                  therapy. At least one prior line of therapy must have included a CD20-targeted&#xD;
                  therapy (cohort E).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Relapsed/refractory FL that has progressed or relapsed after at least 2 but no&#xD;
                  more than 3 prior lines of systemic therapy. At least 1 prior line of therapy&#xD;
                  must have included a CD20-targeted therapy (cohort F).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. In Phase 2 only, have at least 1 radiologically measurable lesion based on RECIST v1.1&#xD;
             for participants with solid tumors or Lugano criteria for lymphoma. Tumor lesions&#xD;
             situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has&#xD;
             been demonstrated in such lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: In Phase 2 stage 1, have an additional lesion for pretreatment and on-treatment&#xD;
             biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. In Phase 2 stage 1, willing to consent to mandatory pretreatment and on-treatment&#xD;
             tumor biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: For fresh tumor biopsies, the lesion must be accessible for a biopsy procedure&#xD;
             as assessed by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
