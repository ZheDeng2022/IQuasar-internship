      The main purpose of this study is to determine the safety of combining ipilimumab and&#xD;
      nivolumab with hypofractionated radiotherapy to a single tumor in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      melanoma. Another purpose of this study is to determine the effect of ipilimumab, nivolumab&#xD;
      and hypofractionated radiotherapy on the cancer as compared to ipilimumab and nivolumab.&#xD;
