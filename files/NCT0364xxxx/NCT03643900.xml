  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the development of endoscopic technology, ERCP has been widely used in the diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment of pancreatobiliary diseases, and has become the first treatment for most of the&#xD;
      biliary and pancreatic diseases. Postoperative ERCP pancreatitis (PEP) is the most common and&#xD;
      serious complication after ERCP. The purpose of this study was to explore methods for&#xD;
      preventing postoperative pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participants: Patients with high-risk factors associated with PEP were included in the&#xD;
           no-obvious patients who underwent therapeutic ERCP in our hospital from June 2018 to&#xD;
           December 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Research methods: Patients were randomly divided into indometacin suppositories,&#xD;
           indomethacin suppositories and pancreatic stents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Statistical methods: SPSS 13.0 statistical software was used. The measurement data was&#xD;
           expressed as xÂ± s, and t-test or non-parametric test was used. Chi-square test was used&#xD;
           for count data.&#xD;

      Patients with high risk factors for PEP who will be examined and diagnosed by ERCP at&#xD;
      2018.06-2019.12 in the First People's Hospital of Hangzhou are randomly divided into two&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Record the relevant indicators of each group of patients: 1 before and after surgery 3,&#xD;
      12, 24 h serum amylase changes 2 patients with abdominal pain, abdominal distension, fever,&#xD;
      vomiting and abdominal signs of change; 3 hospital days; 4 CT severity index (CT severity&#xD;
      Index, CTSI score: Balthazar 5 scores were scored as 0 to 4 points; according to the scope of&#xD;
      necrosis was divided into no, &lt;33%, 33% to 50%,&gt; 50%, respectively rated as 0, 2, 4 and 6&#xD;
      points. Addition of the two scores is the CTSI score. 5 According to the diagnostic criteria&#xD;
      for postoperative ERCP pancreatitis, PEP will be diagnosed in patients with persistent&#xD;
      abdominal pain within 24 hours after ERCP and blood amylase increase by more than 3 times the&#xD;
      normal value. Observed 2 groups of post-ERCP pancreatitis, severe pancreatitis and adverse&#xD;
      events Incidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Analyze and compare the above indicators and observe the effect of the two methods on the&#xD;
      reduction of blood amylase level and incidence of pancreatitis. It is clear that rectal&#xD;
      administration of preoperative indomethacin suppository has the same protection against PEP&#xD;
      as pancreatic stenting effect.&#xD;
