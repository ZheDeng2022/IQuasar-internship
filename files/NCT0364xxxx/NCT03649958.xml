      This study seeks to improve symptoms such as pain and sleep problems after concussion, or&#xD;
      mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) through a series of 10 office sessions in which musical&#xD;
      tones are echoed, or mirrored back in real time, to reflect one's own brain activity. Those&#xD;
      who take part in the study will be randomly assigned to receive either tones that are based&#xD;
      on their brain activity/brainwaves, or random tones.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Persistent symptoms after concussion or mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), such as pain and&#xD;
      sleep difficulties, may be related to altered patterns of brain electrical activity,&#xD;
      including changes in amplitude and frequency. The purpose of this study is to evaluate a&#xD;
      noninvasive, closed-loop, acoustic stimulation neurotechnology, High resolution, relational,&#xD;
      resonance-based, electroencephalic mirroring, with standard operating procedures, HIRREM-SOP.&#xD;
      This intervention is intended to improve symptoms by supporting self-optimization of brain&#xD;
      electrical activity. Put more simply, musical tones will be played to echo, or mirror one's&#xD;
      own brainwaves, in real time, allowing opportunity for auto-calibration, self-adjustment, and&#xD;
      equilibration of that brain activity. The hypothesis is that over the course of ten 90-minute&#xD;
      sessions, symptoms related to mTBI, will improve much more with musical tones linked to&#xD;
      brainwaves than with random tones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled at Uniformed Services University/Walter Reed National Military&#xD;
      Medical Center in Bethesda, MD, and Womack Army Medical Center, Fort Bragg, NC. The 106&#xD;
      participants in the first part of the study can be active duty or recently retired service&#xD;
      members, or their family members, who have had a mTBI at least three months and not more than&#xD;
      ten years ago, with related symptoms. Participants will be randomized to either musical tones&#xD;
      that reflect their own brain activity, or random tones. A technologist will oversee each&#xD;
      session in which the tones are presented. Participants and those analyzing outcomes will be&#xD;
      blinded to the nature of the acoustic stimuli received. The primary outcome will be the&#xD;
      change in Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory scores at three months, and the final follow-up&#xD;
      will occur be at six months. Changes in sleep, pain, dizziness, and general quality of life&#xD;
      will also be measured.&#xD;
