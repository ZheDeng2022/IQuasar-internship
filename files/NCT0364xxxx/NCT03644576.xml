  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of ozanimod after repeated dosing on&#xD;
      blood pressure and heart rate response to a single-dose administration of pseudoephedrine&#xD;
      (PSE) in healthy adult subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.&#xD;
      Approximately sixty eligible subjects will be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 fashion with&#xD;
      30 subjects in each treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive placebo or ozanimod once daily (QD) for 30 days. On Day 30, a single&#xD;
      oral dose of pseudoephedrine (PSE) 60 mg will be co-administered with placebo or ozanimod.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population The study will enroll approximately 60 healthy men and non-pregnant,&#xD;
      non-lactating women, ages 18 to 55 years, inclusive, with a body weight of at least 110&#xD;
      pounds (50 kg) and body mass index within the range of 18.0 to 30.0 kg/m2, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study The study duration is 65 ± 2 days.&#xD;

                  which may be oral, injectable, implantable&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine hormone-releasing system&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
             All subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), withdrawal&#xD;
             (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method are not&#xD;
             acceptable methods of contraception. Female condom and male condom should not be used&#xD;
             together.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Male subjects must agree to refrain from donating sperm during the study and until&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Subject has a mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 90 to 140 mmHg, a diastolic blood&#xD;
             pressure (DBP) of 50 to 90 mmHg from three consecutive measurements at Screening and&#xD;
             Day -2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject must be able to comprehend and provide written informed consent, and must be&#xD;
             able to comply with the requirements of the study, including the study visit schedule&#xD;
             and other protocol requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
