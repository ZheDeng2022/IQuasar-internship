    <textblock>
      Pain (spontaneous pain) is a fundamental non-motor symptom (NMS) of Parkinson's disease (PD)&#xD;
      that is prevalent throughout the condition and often unrecognized and undertreated. Different&#xD;
      types of pain have been described in association with PD including musculoskeletal, dystonic,&#xD;
      central and neuropathic pain. Although musculoskeletal pain is the most commonly reported, a&#xD;
      number of patients experience multiple types of pain which are more frequent and disabling in&#xD;
      the intermediate phase of disease and which ultimately have a significant negative impact on&#xD;
      the patient's quality of life. Despite its relevance, the pathophysiological mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying pain in PD are yet to be fully understood. An abnormal nociceptive input&#xD;
      processing in the central nervous system leading to hypersensitivity to evoked pain probably&#xD;
      underlies all the different pain types experienced by PD patients and also intervene in&#xD;
      pain-free PD patients. Additional factors including female gender, depression, disease&#xD;
      duration, motor complications, postural abnormalities, medical conditions associated with&#xD;
      painful symptoms (osteoporosis, rheumatic or degenerative joint disease,) probably contribute&#xD;
      to the quality and distribution of spontaneous pain. Abnormalities in pain processing may be&#xD;
      the consequence of decreased basal ganglia dopaminergic neurotransmission, as dopamine has&#xD;
      been demonstrated to modulate pain perception in supraspinal regions involved in the pain&#xD;
      pathways, including insula, anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus and periaqueductal grey.&#xD;
      Furthermore, a neurodegeneration involving non-dopaminergic systems (such as g-aminobutyric&#xD;
      acid, glutamate, noradrenaline, and serotonin) that modulate pain processing in other regions&#xD;
      of the central nervous systems may also play a relevant role. The variegated pain dimension&#xD;
      experienced by PD patients makes its therapeutic management a demanding challenge for&#xD;
      clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study of the scalp laser-evoked potentials (LEPs) (evoked pain) allows a non-invasive&#xD;
      exploration of pain central pathways in humans. This technique proved useful in elucidating&#xD;
      the physiopathology underlying different pain syndromes. Some data show that LEPs are altered&#xD;
      in PD, in both pain-free PD patients and in PD patients with different kinds of pain, with&#xD;
      amplitude reduction in N2/P2 component. Acute levodopa challenge had no effect in normalizing&#xD;
      the decreased pain threshold/LEPs observed in PD patients in early Parkinson's disease while&#xD;
      in PD patients with motor complications it partially increased pain threshold. This is&#xD;
      consistent with the hypothesis that motor complications and pain may share common&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanisms which include not only dopaminergic but also non-dopaminergic&#xD;
      systems dysfunction (25).This study has been conceived to study spontaneous pain (and/or&#xD;
      evoked pain by laser stimulation) in PD patients (with or without pain) with motor&#xD;
      fluctuations under drugs-on (Safinamide Metansolfonato or Rasagilina Mesilato).&#xD;
