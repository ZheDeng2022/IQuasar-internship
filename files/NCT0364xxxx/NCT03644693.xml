  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low carbohydrate diets such as the ketogenic (KD) and low glycemic index (LGIT) diets have&#xD;
      been shown to be effective in treating drug resistant seizures in children with Angelman&#xD;
      syndrome (AS). The investigators hypothesize that consuming a fat based nutritional&#xD;
      formulation with an exogenous ketone throughout the day will produce urinary ketosis in&#xD;
      children consuming both low and high carbohydrate diets, depending upon dietary background.&#xD;
      The nutritional formulation will provide fuel substrates that push metabolism away from&#xD;
      carbohydrates and towards fat utilization. This research is being done to assess the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of a nutritional formulation for use in dietary interventions in AS.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      An evaluation of the safety and tolerability of a nutritional formulation in Angelman&#xD;
      syndrome in children ages 4-11 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study is conducted over 16 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 week baseline period - Patient continues on current dietary regimen they were on before&#xD;
      joining the study (standard, ketogenic, or LGIT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 week intervention period - Patient consumes either placebo or nutritional formulation for 4&#xD;
      weeks, maintaining their current diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 week washout period - Patient continues on current dietary regimen without consuming any&#xD;
      study formulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 week intervention period - Patient consumes either placebo or nutritional formulation for 4&#xD;
      weeks (crossover), maintaining their current diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 week washout period - Patient continues on current dietary regimen without consuming any&#xD;
      study formulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up phone call to be conducted by study personnel during this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data is captured by the investigator during baseline, intervention, and washout periods, and&#xD;
      by the parent/caregiver daily throughout the protocol using apps loaded on a provided tablet.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study design for this nutritional intervention protocol is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled crossover study. Each patient will receive both nutritional formulation and placebo formulation, with a washout period between each arm. The dietary backgrounds will differ among patients. Acceptable diets include three basic diets: ketogenic diet (i.e. conventional 4:1 or 3:1, modified Atkins), low glycemic index diet (LGIT), and standard American diet (regular diet).</intervention_model_description>
