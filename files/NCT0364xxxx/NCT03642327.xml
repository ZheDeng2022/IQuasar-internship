  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to understand what influences the adoption and implementation of an&#xD;
      innovative approach to pediatric primary care by medical professionals and staff providing&#xD;
      that care. The innovation concerns addressing common psychosocial problems such as parental&#xD;
      depression and substance abuse. Different approaches to training medical professionals will&#xD;
      be examined as well as the use of software versus traditional 'paper and pencil' to&#xD;
      facilitate implementation.&#xD;

      The proposed study, based on SEEK I and II findings is designed to study the effectiveness of&#xD;
      technology driven training strategies to facilitate use of SEEK in helping prevent child&#xD;
      maltreatment (CM) and its adoption and implementation in pediatric and family medicine&#xD;
      settings. The implementation approach is anchored in four stages of the EPIS conceptual&#xD;
      model: Exploration, adoption/Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment. The strong&#xD;
      evidence for SEEK's effectiveness has been underscored by its listing on the websites of the&#xD;
      CDC, AHRQ, AAP, and by the California Clearinghouse for Evidence-Based Interventions in Child&#xD;
      Welfare. Early adopters are increasingly implementing SEEK in primary care settings,&#xD;
      including in Sweden. Four of the 5 healthcare systems in this proposal have implemented SEEK&#xD;
      in some of their practices. However, practices within these systems operate independently of&#xD;
      one another, and there should not be contamination among them. Each practice has its own lead&#xD;
      physician, primary care providers (PCPs) and administrative staff and several have integrated&#xD;
      behavioral health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design. The investigator selected a rigorous Hybrid Type III design which is an approach to&#xD;
      examine implementation outcomes while also examining SEEK's effectiveness in preventing CM,&#xD;
      measured by electron health record (EHR) indicators. Type III designs are facilitated by good&#xD;
      EHR systems due to the low cost of data routinely gathered for clinical, services, and&#xD;
      financial purposes. Five healthcare systems have committed to participating in the project,&#xD;
      without committing individual practices and primary care providers (PCPs). Professionals,&#xD;
      office staff and parents are nested within practices which are nested within the 5&#xD;
      participating healthcare systems. Practices will choose whether to participate, as will&#xD;
      medical professionals within those practices. Participating practices will be randomized to&#xD;
      one of the two training strategies for PCPs - Independent online training vs. a Maintenance&#xD;
      of Certification (MOC) activity approved by the Boards of Pediatrics and of Family&#xD;
      Physicians. Practices will be able to select the facilitation strategy (SEEKonline software&#xD;
      or Traditional 'paper and pencil'). Participating professionals and staff within practices&#xD;
      will need to adhere to the approach adopted by the practice. The design accounts for&#xD;
      heterogeneity in geography, size of healthcare systems, type of primary care (pediatric and&#xD;
      family medicine), and presence of integrated behavioral health. A small random sample of&#xD;
      parents will be recruited from each practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Aim 1, practices and PCPs will be randomized to one of the two training approaches. Using&#xD;
      baseline and follow-up surveys, the investigators will assess the impact of each approach on&#xD;
      PCPs' attitudes, knowledge, sense of competence, level of comfort and practice behavior with&#xD;
      regard to addressing the targeted problems (e.g., parental depression).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 focuses on the implementation of the SEEK model in pediatric and family medicine&#xD;
      primary care practices. Practices will have the option of implementing the model using the&#xD;
      SEEKonline software or the &quot;traditional&quot; paper and pencil approach. The evaluation involves&#xD;
      measuring aspects of implementation such rates of adoption, fidelity to the model, and&#xD;
      sustainment beyond the training. In addition, qualitative interviews will provide data&#xD;
      regarding what facilitates or impedes optimal implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Aim 3, The investigators will assess the impact of the interventions on rates of child&#xD;
      maltreatment (CM) based on ICD 10 diagnoses in EHRs. The investigators will include a&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness analysis by estimating the costs associated with the different approaches&#xD;
      to implementing SEEK.&#xD;

    <measure>Stages of SEEK Implementation Completion (SIC).</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline-48 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Stages of Implementation Completion (SIC) is an observational assessment tool with 8 stages extending from Engagement to achievement of practitioner Competency. Each stage maps onto 3 phases of implementation (Pre-Implementation, Implementation and Sustainment). Competency is viewed as entering into the Sustainment phase. Three scores are calculated for each SIC stage:&#xD;
The time that a practice takes for a stage is calculated (Duration Score) with scores ranging from 0 days to infinity on a continuous scale; Optimal Duration varies by practice but in general longer scores are less desirable.&#xD;
The percentage of activities completed within a stage is calculated (Proportion Score) with the proportion ranging from 0/48 to 46/46; Higher proportion is better.&#xD;
The SIC Stage Score marks the final stage that a site reaches with scores ranging from 1-8. Higher staged score is better 4.) Duration, proportion, and final stage are combined to measure implementation process.</description>

    <measure>SEEK PCP Questionnaire (PCPQ)- Thinking and Behaviors re. Addressing Targeted Risk Factors.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline-48 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PCPQ, used in both SEEK RCTs 20,21, has 5 vignettes, with 7-12 statements assessing PCPs' thinking and practice with regard to addressing the targeted CM risk factors. Each vignette is followed by statements such as &quot;I know how to motivate parents who may be resistant to suggestions&quot; rated on a Likert scale. Items were grouped conceptually into 4 topical scales (e.g., Substance Abuse) and also cross-cutting themes (e.g., Perceived Competence). Cronbach's 107 alphas were adequate for most scales: Depression (.76), IPV (.80), Major Stress (.80) and Substance Abuse (.58), and for most themes: Attitudes (.77), Knowledge (.55), Comfort (.68), Competence (.74) and Practice (.70). Items are scored so that higher scale scores are optimal.</description>

    <description>Parents rate their child's PCP on this measure adapted for pediatric practice from the Patient-Doctor Interaction Scale; reliability and validity are good. The Likert scale was changed to a yes-no response. Individual scores range from 0 - 20; higher scores indicate greater satisfaction.</description>

De-identified aggregate data will be gathered toward study end for all children 0-5 attending the practices during the study - for up to 2 years prior to and during the study.
