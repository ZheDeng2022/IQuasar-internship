  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of OSA is aimed to improve symptoms and mitigate reduce other health&#xD;
      consequences. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is the recognized treatment for OSA,&#xD;
      able to reverse the pathophysiology of OSA and improving sleep continuity, resulting in&#xD;
      improvements in daytime sleepiness and quality of life (QoL). However, low adherence to this&#xD;
      treatment reduces the potential to achieve these benefits. The aim of this real life&#xD;
      retrospective observational study was to assess the adherence to CPAP at 12 month and 10&#xD;
      years. The investigators evaluated also predicitve factors of adherence.&#xD;

      Methods The protocol was approved (2215 CE, June, 19, 2018) by the Ethical Committee of the&#xD;
      Istituti Clinici Scientifici (ICS) Maugeri, Pavia, Italy. All patients at admission to the&#xD;
      Scientific Institute of Tradate gave the informed consent to the scientific use of their&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Participants This study was conducted on a database of patients' discharge records,&#xD;
      available between August, 2006 and December, 2009.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adaptation to CPAP: titration of CPAP was performed either by full-night manual titration&#xD;
      according to the AASM Guidelines or by automatic titration with Auto-Set systems. Further 4&#xD;
      day-time hours of adaptation were performed along two days. Patients underwent also four face&#xD;
      to face sessions with the respiratory therapist, for feed-back of adaptation, optimal&#xD;
      comprehension of procedure of CPAP management. The presence of a caregiver (if any) was&#xD;
      strongly suggested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis An ad hoc electronic form was created to collect all study variables.&#xD;
      Qualitative variables were described with absolute and relative (percentages) frequencies,&#xD;
      whereas quantitative variables were summarized with means (standard deviations) or medians&#xD;
      (interquartile ranges) based on their normal distribution, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-between comparison for qualitative and quantitative variables was performed with the&#xD;
      chi-squared or Fisher exact test when appropriate, and Student t or Mann-Whitney test in case&#xD;
      of parametric or non-parametric distribution, respectively. Comparison of the temporal&#xD;
      variation of continuous variables for the same group was assessed with Anova or Friedman's&#xD;
      test, depending on their normal distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uni- and multi-variable logistic regression analysis was performed to assess which covariates&#xD;
      could be associated with the adherence to CPAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A two-tailed p-value &lt;0.05 was considered significant. All statistical analyses were carried&#xD;
      out using the statistical software STATA version 15 (StatsCorp, Texas).&#xD;

    <description>Epworth Sleepness Scale (ESS).The questionnaire asks the subject to rate his/her probability of falling asleep on a scale of increasing probability from 0 to 3 for eight different situations that most people engage in during their daily lives. The scores for the eight questions are added together to obtain a single number. A number in the 0-9 range is considered to be normal while a number in the 10-24 range indicates that expert medical advice should be sought</description>

        Patients with diagnosis of OSA. According to the International Classification of Sleep&#xD;
        Disorders, OSA was defined as the presence of 5 or more obstructive respiratory events&#xD;
        (apnea, hypopnea or respiratory effort-related arousal) per hour of sleep plus daytime or&#xD;
        nighttime symptoms of OSA, alternatively as the presence of 15 or more obstructive&#xD;
        respiratory events per hour of sleep&#xD;
