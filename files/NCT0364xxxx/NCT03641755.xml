  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a combination of drugs as a possible treatment for breast&#xD;
      cancer with a BRCA mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interventions involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sapacitabine (CYC682)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Olaparib (Lynparza™)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II clinical trial. A Phase I clinical trial tests the safety of an&#xD;
      investigational intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the&#xD;
      investigational intervention to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the&#xD;
      intervention is being studied. It also means that the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration) has not approved the combination of Olaparib and Sapacitabine as a treatment&#xD;
      for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved Olaparib as a treatment for&#xD;
      metastatic HER2 negative breast cancer with a BRCA mutation. Olaparib is an inhibitor of PARP&#xD;
      (poly [adenosine diphosphate-ribose] polymerase), which means that it stops PARP from&#xD;
      working. PARP is an enzyme (a type of protein) found in the cells of the body. In normal&#xD;
      cells when DNA is damaged, PARP helps to repair the damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has not approved Sapacitabine for use in patients including people with this type of&#xD;
      cancer. Sapacitabine and drugs of its class have been shown to have antitumor properties in&#xD;
      many types of cancer, e.g., leukemia, lung, breast, ovarian, pancreatic and bladder cancer.&#xD;
      Sapacitabine may help to stop the growth of some types of cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are evaluating the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      Olaparib in combination with Sapacitabine in BRCA mutant breast cancer.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any previous treatment with a PARP inhibitor, including but not limited to olaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any previous treatment with sapacitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had prior systemic chemotherapy, immune therapy, or investigational&#xD;
             therapy within 3 weeks of study entry. Endocrine therapy must have been discontinued&#xD;
             at least 7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. Patients may receive bisphosphonates or&#xD;
             denosumab during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received prior radiotherapy within 1 week of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  For enrollment during phase II: patients who have received more than 3 prior lines of&#xD;
             cytotoxic chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Prior treatments with hormonal therapy&#xD;
             and non-hormonal targeted therapy are allowed and not counted as a prior line of&#xD;
             cytotoxic chemotherapy. For the purposes of this protocol, the combination of an&#xD;
             aromatase inhibitor and everolimus is not considered cytotoxic chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of treated central nervous system (CNS) metastases are&#xD;
             eligible, provided they meet all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Disease outside the CNS is present&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No clinical evidence of progression in the CNS since completion of CNS-directed&#xD;
                  therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Minimum of 2 weeks between completion of radiotherapy and Cycle 1 Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Recovery from significant (≥ Grade 3) acute toxicity with no requirement for&#xD;
                  escalating doses of corticosteroid over the 7 days prior to treatment start.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants requiring concomitant use of known strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g.&#xD;
                  itraconazole, telithromycin, clarithromycin, protease inhibitors boosted with&#xD;
                  ritonavir or cobicistat, indinavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, boceprevir,&#xD;
                  telaprevir) or moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. ciprofloxacin, erythromycin,&#xD;
                  diltiazem, fluconazole, verapamil). The required washout period prior to study&#xD;
                  entry is 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants requiring concomitant use of known strong (e.g. phenobarbital,&#xD;
             enzalutamide, phenytoin, rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine, carbamazepine, nevirapine&#xD;
             and St John's Wort) or moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g. bosentan, efavirenz, modafinil).&#xD;
             The required washout period prior to study entry is 5 weeks for enzalutamide or&#xD;
             phenobarbital and 3 weeks for other agents.&#xD;

          -  Participants with a QTcF of &gt;470 msec on screening ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a personal or family history of long QT syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because olaparib and sapacitabine are&#xD;
             agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is&#xD;
             an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with the study agents, breastfeeding should be discontinued if&#xD;
             the mother is treated with olaparib or sapacitabine and for one month after receiving&#xD;
             the last dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known active Hepatitis B, C, or known HIV positive status.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants unable to swallow orally administered medication and participants with&#xD;
             gastrointestinal disorders that are likely to interfere with absorption of the study&#xD;
             medications in the opinion of the treating investigator (e.g. malabsorption syndrome&#xD;
             or major stomach or bowel resections).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to sapacitabine or olaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML)&#xD;
             or with features suggestive of MDS/AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of a previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant or double umbilical cord blood&#xD;
             transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of a second primary malignancy, with the following exceptions:&#xD;
             adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancers, curatively treated in situ cancer of the&#xD;
             cervix, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast, stage 1 grade 1 endometrial&#xD;
             carcinoma, and any other solid tumor or lymphoma (without bone marrow involvement)&#xD;
             diagnosed ≥ 5 years prior to study entry and treated with no evidence of disease&#xD;
             recurrence; other exceptions may exist following agreement with the principal&#xD;
             investigator who believes disease recurrence is unlikely.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are involved in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to&#xD;
             both pharmaceutical company staff and/or staff at the study site).&#xD;
