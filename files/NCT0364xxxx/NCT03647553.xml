    <measure>Household Dietary Diversity Scale (HDDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The HDDS reflects household access to food variation and is a count of the food groups consumed over a given reference period. The value of this variable will range from 0 to 12 and represents the total number of food groups consumed.</description>

    <measure>Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>FIES was developed in 2013 by the FAO for global and country monitoring of the severity of food insecurity in the previous 12 months. Since 2014, the Gallup World Poll (GWP) has collected data using the FIES. The FIES consists of eight dichotomous questions and results range on a scale from mild to severe food insecurity. Results are classified based on the total number of affirmative responses ranging from 0-8. While the FIES does not measure food insecurity directly in children, estimates of the percentage of children living in food-insecure households are generally used.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>To access the presalence of anxiety we will be using the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED). This instrument contains 41 items and measures anxiety using four domains: panic/somatic, separation anxiety, generalized anxiety, and school phobia. A total score &gt;25 indicates an anxiety disorder.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the prevalence of depression among girls between 9-14.9 years of age and boys 10-15.9 years of age living in Matiari. We will be using the Mood and Feeling questionnaire to assess depression. A score &gt; 27 may indicate the presence of depression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pubertal status</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the prevalence of pubertal status (pre-puberty, in-puberty, completing puberty) according to chronological age among girls between 9-14.9 years of age and boys 10-15.9 years of age living in Matiari using culturally sensitive methods. Puberty assessment for this study will be composed of two components:&#xD;
Self-Assessment: All participants will be asked a series of questions similar to a medical history to determine their Pubertal Phase ;&#xD;
Physical Assessment: Participants also willing to participate in a modified physical examination for Tanner Stage assessment. Puberty Phase classification after Tanner Stage assessment. Study staff will confirm assent and consent for each physical Tanner Stage assessment.</description>
