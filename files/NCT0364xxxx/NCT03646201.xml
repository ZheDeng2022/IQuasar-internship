    <textblock>
      To develop and evaluate the efficacy of Feeding Fun and Families (FFF), a nutrition education&#xD;
      intervention for low-income mothers emphasizing authoritative food parenting skills, on&#xD;
      preschool aged children's energy intakes from solid fats and added sugars (SoFAS), using a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial conducted in a clinic-based setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FFF will result in lower child SoFAS intakes compared to a no-treatment control group at the&#xD;
      end of the 12 week intervention (primary outcome), adjusted for baseline values.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Feeding Fun and Families (FFF) taught mothers authoritative parenting skills for reducing&#xD;
      children's exposure to and intake of daily energy from SoFAS. FFF was developed and&#xD;
      rigorously testing a contextually sensitive, state-of-the art nutrition education program for&#xD;
      low-income mothers emphasizing parenting skills. This project represents the first systematic&#xD;
      research to translate, from bench-to-bedside, the basic behavioral science on child portion&#xD;
      size to clinic-based and then community level nutrition education programming. FFF is a&#xD;
      nutrition education intervention emphasizing the &quot;hows&quot; of parenting around feeding young&#xD;
      children. Authoritative parenting strategies will target the family food environment,&#xD;
      mothers' own eating behaviors, and their child feeding practices. Based on previous research,&#xD;
      strategies will attempt to reduce SoFAS portions offered to children by reducing the size of&#xD;
      dishware (e.g. cups, bowls, plates) used to serve children and used by children to eat,&#xD;
      reducing portion sizes of amorphous (e.g. pasta) and unit foods (e.g. juice box) served to&#xD;
      children, and encourage feeding practices that provide structure and autonomy support. The&#xD;
      primary outcome, measured at baseline and at the end of the 12 week intervention, children's&#xD;
      energy intake of discretionary calories from SoFAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Formative qualitative research was used to guide the development of FFF in a manner&#xD;
      consistent with low-income mothers' parenting goals and responsive to their socioeconomic&#xD;
      constraints. The FFF intervention was tested the &quot;proof of concept&quot; (i.e. efficacy) by&#xD;
      evaluating an intensive version of the intervention in a randomized clinical trial (RCT). The&#xD;
      findings were used to translate FFF for delivery by Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program&#xD;
      Education (SNAP-Ed) educators in urban communities of VA (VA), with the potential of being&#xD;
      disseminated nationwide through the SNAP-Ed program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Phase I: Qualitatively understand the contextual factors (i.e. psychosocial, economic,&#xD;
           structural) that will support mothers' acceptance and implementation of environmental&#xD;
           and behavioral portion size strategies to decrease SFAS portions among low-income,&#xD;
           at-risk preschoolers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Phase II: To develop and evaluate the efficacy of the FFF obesity prevention nutrition&#xD;
           education program for low-income mothers of preschoolers emphasizing behavioral and&#xD;
           environmental parenting strategies around portion size in a clinic-based setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
           â€¢ FFF will result in lower child SoFAS intakes compared to a no-treatment control group&#xD;
           at the end of the 12 week intervention (primary outcome), adjusted for baseline values&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Phase III: To translate the FFF program for delivery in SNAP-ED to mothers of preschool&#xD;
           aged children.&#xD;
