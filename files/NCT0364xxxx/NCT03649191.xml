      1.0 SUMMARY Most Canadian nursing home (NH) residents are elderly and frail, have multiple&#xD;
      chronic health conditions and impairments, and have dementia. In 2014, 244,000 Canadians&#xD;
      lived in NHs, including 6% of those ≥65 y.o., at a cost of &gt;$10 billion/yr. NH residents&#xD;
      experience high rates of acute illness; approximately 33% have emergency department (ED)&#xD;
      visits and 23% are hospitalized yearly. Many of these visits are avoidable, and expose&#xD;
      residents to iatrogenic complications. In Manitoba &gt;1.5% of NH residents are admitted to&#xD;
      intensive care units yearly, where they receive highly aggressive care. Approximately 30-50%&#xD;
      of NH residents die each year, experiencing a progressive burden of severe symptoms leading&#xD;
      up to death. Thus, there are serious concerns about Advance Care Planning (ACP) and&#xD;
      end-of-life (EOL) care in NHs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Canadians in general have mediocre knowledge of, and engagement in ACP. Also, studies show&#xD;
      that values such as quality of life and aversion to being dependent trump survival in&#xD;
      determining care preferences. Among hospitalized octogenarians, 61% desired comfort care&#xD;
      only, or just a brief trial of aggressive care. A U.S. study found that decisions for LTC&#xD;
      residents to be sent to ED were frequently driven by families who felt unprepared for their&#xD;
      loved ones' death, and insecure about the quality of NH care, where there had been little or&#xD;
      no discussion about ACP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systematic approaches to ACP in NHs have demonstrated benefits, including: increases in ACP&#xD;
      uptake, higher compliance with EOL wishes, higher satisfaction with care and emotional&#xD;
      well-being, reduced family stress and anxiety, and lower rates of hospitalization. Generally,&#xD;
      multimodal ACP interventions have shown the most benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, ACP can improve outcomes for NH residents, their families, and society. The goal of&#xD;
      this proposal is to apply best practices in ACP, and demonstrate that it can be implemented&#xD;
      it in a scalable, sustainable way across provinces. This will result from delivering the ACP&#xD;
      intervention within the existing envelope of NH staffing, and by acquiring most of the data&#xD;
      from the Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI), which is completed quarterly for NH residents&#xD;
      in 9 provinces. As RAI contains information identifying NH residents at the highest risk for&#xD;
      dying within 6-12 months, it will be used to target the ACP intervention to such individuals.&#xD;

      2.0 SPECIFIC AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1. Aim 1. Improve intervention acceptability, buy-in, and usability by engaging a diverse&#xD;
      group of stakeholders to collaboratively design key details of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 1A: The stakeholder group work to identify and agree upon key principles and&#xD;
           practical aspects of ACP in the NH setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 1B: Using the key principles and practical aspects, and existing evidence about&#xD;
           beneficial approaches to ACP in NHs, the investigator group will devise an&#xD;
           evidence-based, integrated ACP intervention that can be applied by existing NH&#xD;
           personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 1C: Guided by the results of the stakeholder meeting, the investigator group will&#xD;
           identify characteristics of NH residents -- available from RAI data routinely and&#xD;
           repeatedly available in Canadian NHs -- to identify a cohort of residents who are at the&#xD;
           highest risk of dying in the following 6-12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 1D: Informed by the results of the stakeholder meeting, and existing data, the&#xD;
           investigator group, will agree upon the outcomes to be assessed in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2. Aim 2. Design and implement training of NH personnel in application of the systematic&#xD;
      approach to ACP devised in Aim#1B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3. Aim 3. For each participating NH, devise an approach for real-time access to, and use&#xD;
      of, the RAI data for residents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4. Aim 4. Applying the systematic approach to ACP devised in Aim#1B, to high-risk NH&#xD;
      residents identified in Aim#1C, will result in improvement in relevant outcomes identified in&#xD;
      Aim#1D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.0 METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1. Aim 1A. During a 1 day meeting in Toronto, the investigators will convene stakeholders&#xD;
      including: investigators, NH residents and families, advocacy groups for the elderly, legal&#xD;
      experts, NH management, NH staff, an expert on inter-professional care, NH physician,&#xD;
      geriatrician, palliative care physician, ethicist, ICU physician, and dietitian. Directed&#xD;
      discussions and breakout sessions will be utilized to identify key principles and practical&#xD;
      components of ACP in the NH setting. All sessions will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2. Aim 1B. After the stakeholder meeting, the investigator group will conduct weekly&#xD;
      telephone conferences to design an integrated, systematic, evidence-based ACP intervention --&#xD;
      which will be referred to as &quot;The BABEL Approach to ACP&quot;. It will be informed by both: (a)&#xD;
      the stakeholder meeting, and (b) existing, published evidence about approaches to ACP in the&#xD;
      long-term care setting that have been demonstrated to improve relevant outcomes. These latter&#xD;
      include, but are not limited to: (i) &quot;Let Me Decide&quot;, (ii) the methods of Morrison et al.,&#xD;
      and (iii) &quot;Respecting Choices&quot;. Criteria will include: likelihood to improve relevant&#xD;
      outcomes, practicability, feasibility, scalability, sustainability and general acceptability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Aim 1C. This aim will utilize national RAI data on NH residents, maintained at the&#xD;
      University of Waterloo by Dr. John Hirdes. Preliminary work in this direction indicates that&#xD;
      44% of all NH residents in the country have one or more of the following, high-risk&#xD;
      characteristics, all available from the RAI data: CHESS score ≥3, cancer, congestive heart&#xD;
      failure, leave &gt;25% of their food uneaten.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4. Aim 1D. There will be discussion during the stakeholder meeting, specifically addressing&#xD;
      which potential outcomes are relevant and should be tracked. Informed by those discussions,&#xD;
      and outcomes studied in prior studies of ACP in long-term care, the investigator group will&#xD;
      compile a final list of outcomes for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5. Aim 2. After design of The BABEL Approach to ACP, the investigator group will continue&#xD;
      weekly conference calls to develop a detailed plan to train NH staff in implementing it. The&#xD;
      investigators and study coordinators in each province will provide the training, which is&#xD;
      expected to include (but may not be limited to) applied learning, intentional case studies,&#xD;
      role-playing exercises, targeted discussions and adjunctive print, video, and web-based&#xD;
      materials. Criteria for the training methods include: practicability, feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability, scalability, and sustainability. Training will occur in the NHs, and will not&#xD;
      include actual residents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.6. Aim 3. Local investigators and study coordinators will visit each participating NH, and&#xD;
      working with NH personnel will: (i) locate how the NH staff conduct the quarterly RAI&#xD;
      surveys, (ii) locate where the data is maintained in the NH, and (iii) devise a method, with&#xD;
      the direct assistance of NH personnel, for using the RAI data to identify residents who meet&#xD;
      targeting criteria (Aim#1C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.7. Aim 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.7.A. GENERAL METHODS: This will be a cluster-randomized study in 24 NHs in Ontario,&#xD;
      Manitoba, and Alberta, divided equally between intervention and control (total counts are:&#xD;
      Ontario=13, Alberta=6, Manitoba=5). Informed consent will be obtained from cognitively intact&#xD;
      residents, and from their substitute decision-maker (SDM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.7.B. ACP IN CONTROL NURSING HOMES Eligible residents in the 12 control NHs will receive the&#xD;
      prevalent approach to ACP. No elements of The BABEL Approach to ACP will be introduced in the&#xD;
      control homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.7.C. ACP INTERVENTION NURSING HOMES The intervention comprises: (i) training on, and&#xD;
      introduction of The BABEL Approach to ACP for targeted NH residents, and (ii) after these ACP&#xD;
      discussions occur, notifying the resident's primary care physician of the residents' ACP&#xD;
      preferences, as elicited by the ACP. Intervention homes will be asked to use the systematic,&#xD;
      evidence-based approach to ACP for targeted residents. They will be free to use it in&#xD;
      non-targeted residents, but it will not be specifically requested that they do so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.7.D. INFORMED CONSENT In both intervention and control homes informed consent will be&#xD;
      sought from eligible residents (or surrogate consent from SDMs, for residents deemed to lack&#xD;
      capacity to provide informed consent), and separately from SDMs. As the ACP approach of our&#xD;
      intervention is not investigational, the investigators believe it does not require informed&#xD;
      consent, per se. However, informed consent from residents is required to obtain their&#xD;
      personal information, track the course of their ACP wishes/decisions, obtain their clinical&#xD;
      outcomes, and include their data in group form in analyses, reports and manuscripts from the&#xD;
      research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Residents' clinical outcome information will be obtained from a combination of: their nursing&#xD;
      home records, their physician, emergency departments, urgent care, and hospitals. A separate&#xD;
      page on the consent form serves specifically as consent to obtain such medical information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent from SDMs is required to contact them separately in order to send them a&#xD;
      survey assessing their satisfaction with care at end-of-life provided to the NH resident.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.7.E. ANALYSIS OF RESIDENT OUTCOMES Most of these analyses will use hierarchical (2-level)&#xD;
      random effects models to account for clustering within NHs, and possible differences between&#xD;
      intervention and control groups that might occur, despite randomization. The provinces will&#xD;
      be included as fixed effects; interaction terms between province and Intervention/Control&#xD;
      will be included to account for possible influences of existing approaches to ACP undertaken&#xD;
      by provinces (e.g. PoET in Ontario). Logistic regression will be used for binary outcomes,&#xD;
      Poisson regression for rates, OLS regression for continuous variables. The time-to-event&#xD;
      analysis will use Cox proportional hazards regression with fixed effects to represent the&#xD;
      nursing homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resident-level covariates, obtained from NH records and RAI will be: age at NH admission&#xD;
      (stratified), gender, marital status at study entry, elapsed time from NH admission to study&#xD;
      entry (stratified), location immediately prior to NH entry (as home, assisted living, other&#xD;
      LTC facility, hospital or other acute care facility, Chronic Continuing Care facility [in ON&#xD;
      only]), medical conditions/diagnoses, CHESS score at study entry, whether at study entry&#xD;
      resident was leaving ≥25% of NH food uneaten, and use of specific medications at study entry.&#xD;
      Nursing home-level covariates will be: # of beds (stratified), ownership (public vs.&#xD;
      private), and elements of pre-existing ACP approaches as derived from the Nursing Home&#xD;
      Environmental Scan (specific variables still to be determined, but will do so before doing&#xD;
      any analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.7.F. ANALYSIS OF SDM OUTCOMES Analysis will use hierarchical (2-level) mixed models to&#xD;
      account for clustering within NHs, and possible differences between intervention and control&#xD;
      groups that might occur, despite randomization. The provinces will be included as fixed&#xD;
      effects; interaction terms between province and Intervention/Control will be included to&#xD;
      account for possible influences of existing provincial approaches to ACP (e.g. PoET in&#xD;
      Ontario). Covariates, obtained from the SDM participants, NH records, and RAI will include&#xD;
      all of the covariates from Section 3.7.E, and in addition: SDM age at resident death&#xD;
      (stratified), SDM gender, and SDM relationship to deceased resident.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.7.G. ANALYSIS OF NH STAFF OUTCOMES Analysis of NH staff self-efficacy in ACP will compare&#xD;
      the pre-study to post-study difference in self-efficacy ratings between intervention and&#xD;
      control NHs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis, in intervention NHs only, of NH staff perceptions of The BABEL Approach to ACP, and&#xD;
      to the training in it's use will be mainly descriptive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of the semi-structured interview of NH personnel will involve thematic analysis,&#xD;
      compared between Control and Intervention homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.7.H. ANALYSIS OF PROCESS OUTCOME OF THE RATE OF DOCUMENTED ACP DISCUSSIONS Analysis will&#xD;
      use the hierarchical (2-level) random effects Poisson modeling strategy of section 3.7.E.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.7.I. SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For this calculation, use was made of PASS 2008 sample size software (NCSS, LLC,&#xD;
           Kaysville, Utah). Specifically, the calculation for Two Independent Means with a&#xD;
           cluster-randomized design.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This calculation was for the co-primary outcome of the ACP Audit survey given 6 weeks&#xD;
           after study entry, specifically the fraction of items #1-7 answered 'Yes'. Thus, the&#xD;
           scale goes from from 0-7.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It used the following assumptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Mean±SD score:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Control homes = 5.0±1.5 (72% 'yes') (33, 34)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Intervention homes = 5.6±1.5 (85% 'yes')&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  5% Type I error rate&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Average of 150 residents in each NH, of whom 0.5% are in respite care (2)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  44% of NH residents are at high risk of death or other acute outcomes, defined as&#xD;
                any of: CHESS ≥ 3, cancer, congestive heart failure, or leave &gt;25% of their food&#xD;
                uneaten. (personal communication, Dr. John Hirdes, University of Waterloo)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  75% rate of consent among eligible NH residents&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Equal proportion of NHs in intervention and control groups&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for the primary outcome = 20% Using these&#xD;
                assumptions, 12 NHs in each group (24 total) gives power of 83% (total N=1164).&#xD;
