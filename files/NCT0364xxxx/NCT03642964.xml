      This is a Phase 2a, placebo-controlled, single-blind study in up to 24 patients with major&#xD;
      depressive disorder (MDD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will sign consent form prior to any study related procedure and will complete&#xD;
      screening assessments. Subjects will be randomized to either the treatment group or the&#xD;
      placebo group at a ratio of 1:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in two parts. Titration period On Day 1, subjects will complete&#xD;
      all baseline assessments prior to the 1st dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pramipexole group: Consenting individuals meeting accession criteria will start pramipexole&#xD;
      2.0mg daily dose (1.0mg twice a day) with ondansetron 16mg daily dose (8mg twice a day).&#xD;
      Pramipexole will be titrated up daily or every two days depends on each patients'&#xD;
      tolerability up to the first intolerable dose (FID) or maximum allowed dose (5 mg/day)&#xD;
      according to titration schedule (Table 1). Once subjects reach their FID, their maximum&#xD;
      allowed dose (MTD) will be defined as 1 mg below their FID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During titration, subjects will be admitted to the clinic (subjects will be discharged on the&#xD;
      day following their pramipexole FID or Day 8 if subjects reach to 5 mg/day of pramipexole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo group will take 3 placebo tablets twice a day. Maintenance period During the&#xD;
      maintenance phase, patients will be treated with pramipexole MTD or MAD with ondansetron&#xD;
      16mg/day for the remainder of the 8-week treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo group is taking 3 tablets of placebo twice a day during the trial. Exit visit After&#xD;
      the Week 8 visit, study medications will be discontinued, and subject will return for Exit&#xD;
      visit at Week 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the Exit visit, all subjects will return to their prior treatment for depression or&#xD;
      started on a new therapeutic regimen as medically appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At study completion (or at other times in accordance with Stopping Rules given below), and&#xD;
      all study participants will return to their pre-admission therapeutic regimen or started on a&#xD;
      new therapeutic regimen as medically appropriate. Higher doses of pramipexole IR may be&#xD;
      tapered off at rates deemed medically appropriate by PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this modified single blind study, efficacy raters will be kept unaware of the&#xD;
      participants' treatment status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will be appointed to have&#xD;
      responsibility for safeguarding the interests of the trial subjects and assessing the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of the study treatments during the trial.&#xD;
