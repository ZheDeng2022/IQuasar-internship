      This Phase II research project will test the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of an&#xD;
      experimental drug combination: either nivolumab and BBI608 or nivolumab and BNC105 in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have previously failed standard of care&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

      This is an open-label, multicentre, parallel phase II study designed to assess the efficacy&#xD;
      of the combination of nivolumab and BNC105 and the combination of nivolumab and BBI-608.&#xD;
      Patients with microsatellite stable adenocarcinoma of colorectal origin that is not&#xD;
      resectable are eligible and will be randomised in the ratio of 1:1 using permuted block&#xD;
      randomisation with stratification by screening ECOG performance status (0 or 1) to receive&#xD;
      either nivolumab and BNC105 or nivolumab and BBI-608.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected sample size is 90 patients over a 24 month recruitment period.&#xD;
