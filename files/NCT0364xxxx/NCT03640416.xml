      There is an increase interest in the use of wearable activity trackers and wearable&#xD;
      technology in the various medical fields. Such devices can increase physical activity and&#xD;
      decrease weight significantly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Field and laboratory studies have shown that shift work can alter circadian rhythms, disrupt&#xD;
      the sleep cycle, and hinder human performance. Sleep deprivation reduces alertness level, and&#xD;
      may increase reaction time, cause memory impairment and impaired motor skills. Disrupted&#xD;
      circadian rhythms, a well-known consequence of atypical work schedules, have been linked to&#xD;
      neurodegeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility of wearable devices to collect&#xD;
      data on physiologic parameters during sleep and awake under stress conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include 30 Rambam Health Care Campus medical residents who work&#xD;
      nights on call. The length of experiment per participant will be one month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjective data on stress will be collected during the study. Data on vital signs and sleep&#xD;
      stages will be collected through a smart watch Fitbit速 Charge HR.&#xD;

      Background There is an increase interest in the use of wearable activity trackers and&#xD;
      wearable technology in the various medical fields. Such devices can increase physical&#xD;
      activity and decrease weight significantly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shift work is usually referred to as dividing working hours among two or more occupational&#xD;
      groups in order to cover the time needed for duty performance or for production process, and&#xD;
      shift workers perform duties outside the regular working hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Field and laboratory studies have shown that shift work can alter circadian rhythms, disrupt&#xD;
      the sleep cycle, and hinder human performance. Sleep deprivation reduces alertness level, and&#xD;
      may increase reaction time, cause memory impairment and impaired motor skills. Disrupted&#xD;
      circadian rhythms, a well-known consequence of atypical work schedules, have been linked to&#xD;
      neurodegeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of wearable devices to collect data on physiologic&#xD;
      parameters during sleep and awake under stress conditions (night shifts).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: To assess physiological parameters collected by wearable devices. This&#xD;
      study will help us assess the contribution of wearable devices to collect Big Data for future&#xD;
      clinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective pilot study. The study population will include 30 Rambam Health Care&#xD;
      Campus medical residents who work nights on call (not restricted to emergency departments).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mobile phone application has been developed for the study. The application will be&#xD;
      installed on each participant's smart phone (with Android operating system), and it will&#xD;
      collect data on number of calls and SMS received during a night on call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will register to the mobile application without the need for a mobile number&#xD;
      or e-mail address. The data collected will not be linked to a phone number or other personal&#xD;
      information. Only the investigators of the Pediatric Pulmonology institute will have access&#xD;
      to the data collected by the mobile application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only the data on number of calls and SMS will be collected during a night on call. The data&#xD;
      will not include the content of the calls or SMS or the phone number of the sender or&#xD;
      receiver of the calls and SMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital signs and data on sleep quality will be collected through a wearable device, which&#xD;
      interacts with the mobile application. The wearable device used will be the Fitbit速 Charge&#xD;
      HR. Recent studies have shown that this wearable device provides an accurate measurement of&#xD;
      heart rate during walking and running activities and energy expenditure . The device has been&#xD;
      shown to have high accuracy in sleep evaluation and circadian rest-activity rhythm&#xD;
      measurement (8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Fitbit速 Charge HR collects data on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continuous heart rate monitoring (heart beats per minute (BPM), average resting heart&#xD;
           rate, and time spent in heart-rate zones)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sleep stages (light, deep and REM [Rapid Eye Movement) sleep) and auto sleep tracking&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Periods of time stationary vs. active (walked at least 250 steps)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Steps taken&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Distance covered&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Calories burned The Fitbit速 Charge HR is a commercial product widely used worldwide, and&#xD;
           data from the device is sent to a secured online server and can be accessed by each user&#xD;
           to see only data collected from his own device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will provide written informed consent including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Approval to join the experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Information on Age, gender, height.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Telephone number.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Approval to collect time of SMS and phone calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Approval to provide all data collected from the wearable device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Approval to collect hair and blood sample. It should be emphasized that all data on each&#xD;
           participant will be collected anonymously, and no data will be provided to the health&#xD;
           management of Rambam or any 3rd party.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be given a coded name (starting STR1, STR2 etc..), and only the&#xD;
      principal investigator will have access to the real name and ID numbers of the participants&#xD;
      In addition, no genetic testing will be performed on hair or blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 - recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the experiment, each participant will schedule a at 9-10 am with an&#xD;
      investigator in which the participant will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  receive detailed information about the study, including data collection, privacy and&#xD;
           security issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  sign an informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  provide a table of nights on call for the month of the experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  receive the activity wearable device and instructions on its functionality and&#xD;
           requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  provide demographic information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess baseline stress level:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Provide a hair sample (0.5 gr) for cortisol measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Complete PSS - Perceived Stress Scale questionnaire (12).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Provide a blood test (6 ml) to evaluate stress hormones and specific cytokines for&#xD;
                assessing stress. The serums will be stored and for any future use an amendment&#xD;
                will be submitted to the Rambam helsinky committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Digit-span test - measures working memory's number storage capacity. The&#xD;
                participant hears a sequence of numerical digits and is asked to recall the&#xD;
                sequence correctly, with increasingly longer sequences being tested in each trial.&#xD;
                The participant's span is the longest number of sequential digits that can&#xD;
                accurately be remembered.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  PASAT - Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test - measures capacity and rate of&#xD;
                information processing and sustained and divided attention. The participant is&#xD;
                given a number every 3 seconds and is asked to add the number he just heard with&#xD;
                the number he heard before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trail Making test - cellular application that provides information about visual search speed,&#xD;
      scanning, The test consists of two parts: in the first, the targets are all numbers (1, 2, 3,&#xD;
      etc.) and the test taker needs to connect them in sequential order; in the second part, the&#xD;
      subject alternates between numbers and letters (1, A, 2, B, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection during month of participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Around each night on call of a participant:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. From 24 hours before the night on call: Charge and wear the wearable. It is preferred&#xD;
           that participants wear the device continuously throughout the month, except when&#xD;
           charging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. During the night on call:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Continuous tracking of vitals, steps, sleep time and quality will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  1-4 SMS messages will be sent randomly by one of the investigators of the Pediatric&#xD;
                Pulmonology institute asking the participant to send a number between 1 and 5&#xD;
                indicating their subjective stress (1 means no stress and 5 means very stressed).&#xD;
                Data will be collected by the investigator, no data will be saved on a remote&#xD;
                server.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. From night on call end until 24 hours later: continue wearing the wearable device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 24 hours after the end of night on call (10:00 in the morning): respond to a message&#xD;
           from one of the investigators to provide subjective stress level.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Visit 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Immediately after one of the nights on call (9:00-10:00 in the morning):&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Participants will complete a second PSS - Perceived Stress Scale questionnaire (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Blood pressure and heart rate will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. a 5 ml blood sample will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Digit-span test, PASAT, Trail Making test will be preform again The visits will be&#xD;
                scheduled and done in the Rambam health care campus in a location and timing&#xD;
                suitable to the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis After data collection, we will build a statistical model that will try to&#xD;
      estimate stress based on behavioral characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stress will be estimated using:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Self-reports (scale of 1-5 on subjective stress through random messages from the study&#xD;
           mobile application during night on call).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Heart rate, heart rate variability, blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Digit-span test, PASAT, Trail Making test before and after nightshift will be analyzed 3&#xD;
           Digit-span test, PASAT, Trail Making test will be preform again The behavioral&#xD;
           characteristics will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Length and time of sleep before, during and after a shift, and sleep stages tracking&#xD;
      (light, deep and REM sleep) 2. Interruptions (SMS, calls, movement) during wake and sleep 3.&#xD;
      Movement during the shift (time while being stationary vs. active)&#xD;
