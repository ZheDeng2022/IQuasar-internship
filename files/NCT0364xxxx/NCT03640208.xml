  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The burden of colorectal cancer (CRC) is unequal among various populations within the United&#xD;
      States. This inequality is most notable among African Americans, who exhibit the highest CRC&#xD;
      mortality of all US populations. This study aims to evaluate a community-based intervention&#xD;
      to educate, assess risk, and overcome barriers to screening among African Americans who are&#xD;
      45 years or older with no personal history of CRC, adenomas, or inflammatory bowel disease&#xD;
      and have no family history of CRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Barriers being assessed include: Need for establishing care with primary care physician, need&#xD;
      for financial assistance, need for reminder calls, need for transportation, need for&#xD;
      appointment coordination, and need for education about colonoscopy preparation and procedure&#xD;

      After reviewing the existing literature this study team believes that the proposed strategy&#xD;
      is inherently unique, thus amenable to experimental inquiry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will provide much needed data to define the extent to which the proposed&#xD;
      multi-faceted approach may be effectively deployed to the target population. This includes&#xD;
      the acquisition of data to evaluate the educational program, for which improvement in&#xD;
      knowledge may be tested objectively using the study design, as well as survey and feasibility&#xD;
      data which is pivotal for improving the strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 11 steps for completing cancer screening are listed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demographic/Socio-economic information&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Knowledge assessment and education&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Risk assessment questionnaire &quot;Am I Average Risk?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Do I need screening colonoscopy?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Barriers to colorectal cancer screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Outreach program evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Participants data entered in REDCap database&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Communication with primary care provider and navigator&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Participant navigation&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Evaluation of navigation services&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Program monitoring&#xD;

    <description>After participants complete the Pre-test, an educational session will be presented by a trained caregiver, delivered in a lecture-style manner with Power Point projection of educational material. The slides in this presentation will be scripted to mitigate variability among different presenters. Topics addressed in the presentation include: CRC basics (including brief anatomy), data on disparity, risk factors, screening modalities, preventative measures, population disparities of CRC, colonoscopy exam and other screening tests. The emphasis will be on CRC risks factors and prevention. All required information that is needed to correctly answer post-test questions is embedded within the presentation.</description>
