  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to develop regenerative cell therapy for use in female&#xD;
      patients with aging skin. The primary objective of this proposal is to conduct a pilot study&#xD;
      on the efficacy and safety of using PRP to treat this condition in females.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently, there has been interest in treatments which are orientated to more biologically&#xD;
      regenerative therapies, with several studies demonstrating successful use for PRP in skin&#xD;
      rejuvenation. Although PRP is widely used in clinical dermatology, experimental studies&#xD;
      confirming the effects of PRP on aged fibroblasts are very limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRP contains concentrated platelet cells derived from autologous whole blood that are&#xD;
      believed to induce the synthesis of collagen and other matrix components by stimulating the&#xD;
      activation of fibroblasts, thus rejuvenating the skin when injected into an area of collagen&#xD;
      degeneration. In this proposal we will examine whether PRP therapy provides similar or better&#xD;
      rejuvenating capacity in women compared to saline solution. The study will be a randomized,&#xD;
      controlled trial comparing microneedling with PRP to microneedling with saline solution, in&#xD;
      females aged 45 and over with skin aging of face. This study will also compare PRP to saline&#xD;
      (given through injections via filler injection technique) in females with aging skin of the&#xD;
      hands. Microneedling will not be performed on the hands.&#xD;

    <description>The Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale assesses the presence and severity of wrinkles at rest in a rating scale from 0 to 4, where 0 means no visible wrinkles, 1 means minimal wrinkles, 2 means shallow wrinkles, 3 means moderately deep wrinkles and 4 means very deep wrinkles.</description>

    <measure>Hand Grading Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Hand Grading Scale assesses signs of hand aging based on loss of fat tissue and visibility of veins and tendons. It is rating scale form 0 to 4 where 0 means no loss of fat tissue, 1 means mild loss of fat tissue and slight visibility of veins, 2 means moderate loss of fat tissue and mild visibility of veins and tendons, 3 means severe loss of fat tissue and moderate visibility of veins and tendons and 4 means very severe loss of fat tissue and marked visibility of veins and tendons.</description>

    <description>Autologous Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) will be isolated from the blood collected from each subject at each treatment time point.&#xD;
Face: Using a 30 gage needle, about four points of PRP or saline will be injected into the malar area; about six points will be injected into the mandibular area; and seven points will be injected into the forehead (0.2 mL per point) with a total volume of approximately 3.5 mL. PRP and saline application will be followed by microneedling.&#xD;
Hands: Using a 30 gage needle about 1 cc of PRP or saline will be injected into the dorsal area of the hands (0.2mL per point) at five points. No microneedling will be performed on the hands.</description>
