  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sarcoma is a rare cancer. It grows in the body s connective tissue. Sarcomas in the brain&#xD;
      and central nervous system are especially rare. The drug Sunitinib has been approved in many&#xD;
      countries for treating other types of rare or advanced cancers. These include kidney,&#xD;
      pancreas, and bowel cancer. Researchers want to see if it can help people with sarcomas of&#xD;
      the central nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the effects of Sunitinib on gliosarcomas or sarcomas of the central nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 and older with a gliosarcoma or sarcoma of the central nervous system&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with the following tests. Some may be done as part of their&#xD;
      regular cancer care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication review&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood, heart, and pregnancy tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cranial scans to locate and measure their tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take Sunitinib by mouth every day for 2 weeks and then take none of the&#xD;
      drug for 1 week. These 3 weeks equal 1 cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 2 study visits in cycle 1. They will have 1 visit in all other cycles.&#xD;
      They will answer questions about quality of life and repeat some screening tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take their blood pressure at home weekly. They keep a diary of each dose of&#xD;
      Sunitinib and blood pressure reading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants can choose to share data about their physical activity levels and quality of&#xD;
      sleep. These participants will wear a small, portable watch-sized accelerometer device on the&#xD;
      wrist for 6 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 1 month after their last study drug dose, participants will have a final study visit.&#xD;
      They will have a physical exam, blood tests, and scans.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gliosarcoma and primary CNS sarcomas are malignant brain tumors uniformly associated&#xD;
           with poor outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There are no known effective medical therapies for these cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sunitinib is an orally administered small molecule that inhibits signaling of multiple&#xD;
           receptor tyrosine kinases including those known to be activated in CNS sarcomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the anti-tumor effect of sunitinib in recurrent gliosarcomas and primary CNS&#xD;
      sarcomas as assessed by objective response rate (ORR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with histologically proven gliosarcoma and primary CNS sarcoma at disease&#xD;
           relapse after failing standard therapy (surgery and irradiation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor tissue blocks or 15 unstained slides should be available&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects must be greater than or equal to 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Karnofsky performance status of greater than or equal to 60&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have adequate organ function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must not have received tyrosine kinase inhibitor(s) in the past.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a prospective, single institution, single arm, multi-cohort phase II study of&#xD;
           sunitinib in subjects with recurrent gliosarcoma and primary CNS sarcoma that have&#xD;
           failed prior surgery and irradiation (unless radiation therapy was contraindicated).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be classified into three cohorts: 1) Primary gliosarcoma; 2) Secondary&#xD;
           gliosarcoma; 3) Primary CNS sarcoma. Cohort expansion will be carried out at indication&#xD;
           of promising response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sunitinib will be administered orally using a continuous schedule at 50 mg per day (with&#xD;
           dose adjustments allowed for toxicity) for 2 weeks with 1 week off to constitute a&#xD;
           3-week cycle until disease progression or development of intolerable side-effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Toxicity will be assessed every cycle by CTCAE version 5.0.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 times institutional upper limit of&#xD;
                  normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance greater&#xD;
                  than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) for patients with&#xD;
&#xD;
        creatinine levels above institutional normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written&#xD;
             informed consent document indicating that they are aware of the investigational nature&#xD;
             of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of sunitinib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason&#xD;
             and because anti-angiogenic agents are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method&#xD;
             of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or&#xD;
             her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumor tissue blocks or at least 10-15 unstained slides from the diagnosis should be&#xD;
             available.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At the time of registration, all subjects must be removed greater than or equal to 28&#xD;
             days from any investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors or VEGF inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving strong CYP450 inducers or inhibitors are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because sunitinib has potential for&#xD;
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk&#xD;
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             sunitinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with&#xD;
             sunitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known HIV history on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible&#xD;
             because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with sunitinib. In addition,&#xD;
             these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (&gt; 150/100 mmHg) while on antihypertensive medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  New York Heart Association class II or greater congestive heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Baseline echocardiogram with ejection fraction &lt; 50% or greater than or equal to 20%&#xD;
             decrease from a prior study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  QTc interval &gt; 500 msec on baseline EKG&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who require use of therapeutic doses of coumarin-derivative anticoagulants&#xD;
             such as warfarin are excluded, although doses of up to 2 mg daily are permitted for&#xD;
             prophylaxis of thrombosis. Note: Low molecular weight heparin is permitted provided&#xD;
             the patient s INR is less than or equal to 1.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous exposure to anthracyclines.&#xD;
