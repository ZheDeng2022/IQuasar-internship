      The objective of this research is to test a passive shoe to correct gait in individuals with&#xD;
      asymmetric walking patterns. This will be done in a clinic and within their own home.&#xD;
      Individuals with central nervous system damage, such as stroke, often have irregular walking&#xD;
      patterns and have difficulty walking correctly. Recent research has shown that using a&#xD;
      split-belt treadmill can create after-effects that temporarily correct the inefficient&#xD;
      walking patterns. However, the corrected walking pattern does not efficiently transfer from&#xD;
      the treadmill to walking over ground. The iStride, formerly known as the Gait Enhancing&#xD;
      Mobile Shoe (GEMS), may allow a patient to practice walking in many different locations, such&#xD;
      as their own home, which we hypothesize will result in a more permanent transfer of learned&#xD;
      gait patterns. To enable long-term use, our proposed shoe design is passive and uses the&#xD;
      wearer's natural forces exerted while walking to generate the necessary motions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hemiparesis and other impairments are a frequent and disabling consequence of stroke and can&#xD;
      lead to asymmetric and inefficient walking patterns. Training on a split-belt treadmill,&#xD;
      which has two separate treads driving each leg at a different speed, can correct gait&#xD;
      asymmetries post-stroke. However, the effects of split-belt treadmill training only partially&#xD;
      transfer to everyday walking over ground and extended training sessions are required to&#xD;
      achieve long-lasting effects. Our previous studies suggest that the iStride device that has&#xD;
      been developed in our laboratory can be used as an alternative gait training device for&#xD;
      people with stroke. The iStride device mimics the actions of the split-belt treadmill, but&#xD;
      can be used during over-ground walking and in one's own home, thus enabling long-term&#xD;
      training. The iStride device does not require any external power and is completely passive;&#xD;
      all necessary forces are redirected from the natural forces present during walking since it&#xD;
      utilizes the wearer's weight to generate its movements. While the movements of the iStride&#xD;
      device are similar to the split belt treadmill, and the iStride device generates a similar&#xD;
      aftereffect, the efficacy of this shoe in modifying the gait of an individual with stroke is&#xD;
      not yet verified. This research aims to continue to test the iStride device on individuals&#xD;
      with stroke to determine if the related effects in a clinic setting, are also beneficial and&#xD;
      safe in a home environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will test the efficacy of the iStride device on individuals with stroke in&#xD;
      the clinic and within their own home. Efficacy will be evaluated based on the change in gait&#xD;
      coordination and also based on subjects' self-reported comfort on the device. We predict that&#xD;
      the iStride device will result in changes to interlimb coordination of gait and prove to be a&#xD;
      safe and effective device to be used in ones' home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The asymmetric nature of hemiparetic gait can have a large impact on functional walking&#xD;
      ability. For example, swing phase asymmetry is a significant predictor of hemiparetic walking&#xD;
      performance because it strongly correlates with stages of motor recovery, walking speed, and&#xD;
      falls. Another measure of temporal asymmetry - double support duration - is similarly&#xD;
      correlated with walking speed. In addition, spatial (e.g. step length) asymmetry is&#xD;
      associated with decreased propulsive force on the paretic leg, which limits forward motion of&#xD;
      the body and reduces gait efficiency. The importance of gait efficiency should not be&#xD;
      understated - the elevated energy demands of hemiparetic gait combined with physical&#xD;
      deconditioning post-stroke can greatly limit performance of activities of daily living,&#xD;
      contributing to poor cardiovascular fitness and metabolic syndrome. In turn, this can&#xD;
      increase the risks of a second stroke or cardiovascular event and is associated with&#xD;
      increased morbidity and mortality rates. Therefore, improving gait symmetry should be an&#xD;
      important goal for therapy, to not only improve functional mobility and reduce injury, but&#xD;
      also to enhance general health and well-being post-stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Practicing walking on a split-belt treadmill can correct abnormal interlimb coordination of&#xD;
      gait in individuals with hemiparesis following stroke or other central nervous system&#xD;
      lesions. Asymmetric gait can manifest as a spatial asymmetry, in which steps taken on one&#xD;
      side are longer than those on the other. It can also manifest as a temporal asymmetry, where&#xD;
      the timing is uneven on the paretic and non-paretic sides. Temporal asymmetries are often&#xD;
      measured as differences in the duration of double support periods, which are the amount of&#xD;
      time both feet are simultaneously contacting the ground and are measured separately for the&#xD;
      paretic and non-paretic sides. The iStride device is designed to cause changes in both&#xD;
      spatial and temporal gait symmetry. We predict that the iStride device would cause the steps&#xD;
      on the side with the iStride device to be larger since individuals would compensate for the&#xD;
      backward rolling motion by placing their foot farther forward in stance, thus increasing the&#xD;
      distance between the two feet. Similarly, since the stride is longer, it may also shorten the&#xD;
      duration of stance relative to the other side. With shortened stance duration, the amount of&#xD;
      time spent in double-support at the end of stance would likely decrease as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the original idea of the iStride device is derived from the motion of the&#xD;
      split-belt-treadmill, there are distinct differences between walking on the device and&#xD;
      walking on a split-belt treadmill with asymmetric belt velocities. While the body's velocity&#xD;
      relative to ground is zero on a split-belt treadmill, the relative velocity of the iStride&#xD;
      device is non-zero and forward. The device forces the wearer's foot forward or backward&#xD;
      whereas the treadmill moves both feet backward, but at different speeds. For both the&#xD;
      split-belt treadmill and the iStride device, the relative velocity between both feet is&#xD;
      similar and the backward-moving iStride device takes the place of the faster tread.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that training over ground will lead to a change in the interlimb coordination&#xD;
      in individuals with asymmetric gait and allow individuals to develop a more persistent&#xD;
      symmetric gait. There are several differences between training on ground and a treadmill,&#xD;
      such as visual flow and vestibular information signaling forward movement that likely limit&#xD;
      the expression of learning in the over-ground context when trained on a treadmill. Visual&#xD;
      cues appear to be particularly important for context awareness. Visual cues, coupled with&#xD;
      prior experience, are so powerful that predictive postural responses cause an individual to&#xD;
      stumble when stepping onto an escalator that is not moving. The body has learned an internal&#xD;
      model that expects an acceleration when stepping onto an escalator, but when that&#xD;
      acceleration does not occur, the person stumbles. A study of split-belt walking showed that&#xD;
      transfer to over-ground walking is enhanced when subjects are blindfolded during training on&#xD;
      the treadmill and tested over ground. Since blindfolding eliminates visual cues about the&#xD;
      environment, this also suggests that vision is a key factor in determining the&#xD;
      context-dependence of learning. Since it is not realistic to blindfold stroke patients during&#xD;
      gait training, we designed the iStride device so that training could occur during over-ground&#xD;
      walking, thus visual cues during training and later walking over ground would be the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from control subjects using an earlier version of the iStride device (referred to as&#xD;
      GEMS at the time) has been published and a video of this previous version can be found at&#xD;
      http://reedlab.eng.usf.edu/publications/handzic2011GEMS.mp4. In this study, we found that&#xD;
      this earlier version of the device was capable of changing step length as predicted, however&#xD;
      the previous design was too heavy and too tall to be considered practical for testing in&#xD;
      stroke populations. The current version of the iStride device produces similar motion to the&#xD;
      previous version, but it weighs less (under 1 kg) and is shorter (~4.4 cm). We will test the&#xD;
      efficacy of wearing the current iStride device on gait coordination during walking over&#xD;
      ground on individuals with stroke in the clinic and within their own home. All walking will&#xD;
      be performed while subjects are closely guarded by an experienced physical therapist to&#xD;
      prevent falling. The effects of the iStride device on gait coordination will be compared to&#xD;
      those induced on a split-belt treadmill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project represents one of the first attempts to build a device that corrects&#xD;
      walking symmetry while walking over ground. Not only would this allow people to experience&#xD;
      gait corrections while performing normal movements, but the simplicity and relative low cost&#xD;
      of these devices would also open up potential opportunities to train at home (for&#xD;
      high-functioning individuals with supervision) and in clinics where a split-belt treadmill is&#xD;
      not available. The studies outlined here will establish whether the iStride device is capable&#xD;
      of changing interlimb coordination of gait, and whether individuals with stroke can use these&#xD;
      devices for rehabilitation purposes. This work will thus build the foundation for future&#xD;
      training studies examining the effectiveness of long-term use of the iStride device for&#xD;
      improving symmetric walking patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The question that this study targets is the modification of human walking patterns for use in&#xD;
      stroke rehabilitation. It is our ultimate objective to show that the iStride device can&#xD;
      change a person's temporal and spatial gait asymmetry into a symmetric gait. We have&#xD;
      demonstrated this in a clinic setting, and now we will test the device within the&#xD;
      participants own home. Our points of reference are results obtained by previous studies with&#xD;
      split-belt treadmills. We are also interested in how altering the interface between a foot&#xD;
      and the ground influences the adaptation to new walking patterns.&#xD;

    <description>During a symmetric gait, step lengths on each side are the same; during an asymmetric gait, step lengths are different.
