  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, single-arm, on-label study. This clinical study will be conducted&#xD;
      at up to 2 sites with a total of 10 subjects per site. All subjects will receive standard of&#xD;
      care treatment which includes DFU treatments with the dermaPACE device.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The dermaPACE system will be used according to label along with standard of care. perfusion&#xD;
      will be measured using TcPO2 methods and also using cleared hyperspectral imaging equipment.&#xD;
      The intent of the study is to observe/measure oxygen saturation levels in the area of the&#xD;
      treated wound before initiation of dermaPACE treatment, during the treatment period, and two&#xD;
      weeks post treatment period&#xD;

  <why_stopped>
    Mfr of product identified in protocol to measure perfusion after treatment with sponsor device&#xD;
    withdrew support from the study. Sponsor decided to cancel the investigation due to lack of&#xD;
    adequate replacement.&#xD;
