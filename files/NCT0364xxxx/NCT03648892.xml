      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dopamine is a natural chemical in the brain that may influence eating behavior and physical&#xD;
      activity. Researchers want to measure the brain s dopamine activity and understand how it&#xD;
      differs in people with obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To better understand how brain function, particularly dopamine activity, relates to body&#xD;
      weight and eating behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals may be able to participate if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have a BMI of at least 18.5 kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Are weight-stable and generally healthy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Are between ages 18-45 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have normal blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Are not using illegal drugs (based on urine drug screen)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Are not following a special diet&#xD;
&#xD;
      Do not have metal implants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires and an interview to see if it is safe to have a PET/MRI scan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fasting blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will eat a special diet given to them for the 5 days before their inpatient&#xD;
           visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a 5-day inpatient visit. Some days include blood and urine tests. Each&#xD;
      day includes surveys and tests to measure habits and likes/dis-likes. A sample schedule may&#xD;
      be:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1: Participants will wear a monitor that uses a needle below the skin to measure glucose.&#xD;
      Their body fat will be measured with low-dose x-rays&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 2: Participants will have a PET scan. They will lie on a table that slides in and out of&#xD;
      a donut-shaped scanner. They will be injected with a small amount of a radioactive substance&#xD;
      and wear a cap on their head.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 3: Participants will have an MRI. They will lie on a table that slides in and out of a&#xD;
      scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 4: Participants will have another PET scan. This time, they will drink a milk shake&#xD;
      during a break from the scanner. Then, they will go back inside the scanner for the end of&#xD;
      their scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 5: Participants will wear a hood for up to 40 minutes to measure their breathing. They&#xD;
      will also drink special water and collect samples of their urine to measure the rate they&#xD;
      burn energy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For 12 months after the visit, participants will track their weight and physical activity&#xD;
      daily using a special scale and activity monitor. A few times over the year, the study team&#xD;
      will send participants special activity monitors to use for 7 days at a time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have an in-person 1-day follow-up visit. This includes most tests except&#xD;
      for PET scanning.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Evidence from neuroimaging studies indicates that aberrant functionality in brain regions&#xD;
      that support reward processing and habit formation may be related to an individual's eating&#xD;
      behavior and obesity propensity. In particular, our previous research found that increased&#xD;
      dopamine D2 receptor binding potential (D2BP) in the dorsal and lateral striatum was&#xD;
      positively related to opportunistic eating behaviors, body fat, and body mass index (BMI).&#xD;
      However, our findings were contrary to highly-cited previous reports of D2BP correlating with&#xD;
      BMI in the opposite direction. The primary aim of this study is to elucidate the reasons for&#xD;
      the conflicting results that used somewhat different methodologies. Specifically, our&#xD;
      previous study used positron emission tomography (PET) to measure D2BP using the dopamine D2&#xD;
      receptor antagonist radioligand [18F]fallypride following a period of dietary stabilization&#xD;
      and 3 hours after a standardized breakfast. Reports finding correlations between D2BP and BMI&#xD;
      in the opposite direction have typically investigated subjects with higher BMI using the D2&#xD;
      receptor antagonist radioligand [11C]raclopride. Furthermore, previous studies were typically&#xD;
      conducted in the fasted state, but the subjects' prior food intake was not well-controlled.&#xD;
      The present study will attempt to resolve the controversy by measuring D2BP using both&#xD;
      [18F]fallypride and [11C]raclopride in 39 adults, 13 within each of three BMI strata to&#xD;
      represent a large BMI range, under controlled overnight fasting conditions following a period&#xD;
      of dietary stabilization. The primary aims are to estimate the mathematical relationship&#xD;
      between striatal D2BP and BMI and determine the within-subject correlations of D2BP derived&#xD;
      from [18F]fallypride and [11C]raclopride.&#xD;

Female subjects of reproductive potential will also complete a urine pregnancy test on Day 1 of the inpatient visit and interviewed about the possibility of pregnancy. Positive test results will preclude subjects from further participation.
