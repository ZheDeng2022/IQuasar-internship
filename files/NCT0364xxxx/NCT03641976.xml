      RATIONALE: Recently, the importance of prognosis according to the location of the primary&#xD;
      tumor in colorectal cancer has been raised. In the CALGB / SWOG 80405 study published in&#xD;
      2016, the addition of bevacizumab or cetuximab to the first line FOLFIRI / FOLFOX in KRAS&#xD;
      (codon 12, 13) wild type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients did not show a&#xD;
      significant difference between overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) in&#xD;
      both groups. Alan P. Venook et al. published a follow-up subgroup analysis on the effect of&#xD;
      primary tumor location at 2016 ASCO. In the treatment group with cetuximab, the difference in&#xD;
      treatment effect was significant according to the primary tumor location. The right colon&#xD;
      cancer showed a poor prognosis for cetuximab treatment. (PFS: 7.8 vs 12.4 months, HR 1.56, p&#xD;
      &lt;0.0001 / OS: 16.7 vs 36.0months, HR 1.87, P &lt;0.0001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators propose a phase II trial for the efficacy evaluation of&#xD;
      bevacizumab-FOLFOXIRI and bevacizumab-FOLFIRI or FOLFOX treatment in patients with poor&#xD;
      prognosis of unresectable right-sided colorectal cancer.&#xD;

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to ECOG performance&#xD;
      status (0 vs 1-2), prior adjuvant chemotherapy (yes vs no), and participating center.&#xD;
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm I (A-FOLFOXIRI): Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 1 hour, oxaliplatin IV&#xD;
      over 2 hours, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, and bevacizumab IV on day 1. Patients also&#xD;
      receive fluorouracil IV continuously over 48 hours beginning on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm II (A-FOLFOX/FOLFIRI): Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 1 hour (or&#xD;
      oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours), leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, fluorouracil IV bolus, and&#xD;
      bevacizumab IV on day 1. Patients also receive fluorouracil IV continuously over 48 hours&#xD;
      beginning on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms, treatment repeats every 2 weeks for up to 12 courses. After the 12 cycle&#xD;
      treatment finished, investigator decides whether to keep the study drug. Treatment continues&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression, withdrawal consent, or unacceptable toxicity. If&#xD;
      treatment with oxaliplatin or irinotecan is difficult due to side effects, treatment with&#xD;
      bevacizumab, fluorouracil, and leucovorin calcium continues in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression, withdrawal consent, or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo serum extraction and blood sample collection periodically for genomic, ctDNA&#xD;
      and translational study. Patients also undergo collection of tumoral sections from paraffin&#xD;
      embedded primary and/or metastatic lesions periodically for immunohistochemical analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for survival and&#xD;
      other treatments.&#xD;
