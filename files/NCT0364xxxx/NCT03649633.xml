      This study has been approved as a nested substudy of a multicenter trial (CORVICTES,&#xD;
      Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT03592693). The current, randomized, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      study will compare steroids/vitamin C versus placebo/placebo in septic shock, with respect to&#xD;
      cerebral autoregulation, biomarkers, and functional outcome. The following hypotheses will be&#xD;
      tested: The steroids/vitamin C/thiamine intervention may result in attenuation of the septic&#xD;
      shock-associated impairment in cerebral autoregulation; and 2) The increased frequency of&#xD;
      intact cerebral autoregulation in the intervention group may result in more neurologic&#xD;
      failure free days and ventilator free days during a 60-day follow-up; improved survival to&#xD;
      hospital discharge with good functional outcome; and better patient-reported health-related&#xD;
      outcomes at 90-day follow-up.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE Septic Encephalopathy is a serious complication of sepsis / septic&#xD;
      shock. In postmortem, human brain samples, two forms of neuraxonal injury have been&#xD;
      described, namely, scattered ischemic lesions and diffuse injury. Prior evidence suggests&#xD;
      that cerebral autoregulation is impaired in patients with septic shock, and this may render&#xD;
      the central nervous system more vulnerable to direct ischemic damage, especially during&#xD;
      episodes of hypotension. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) constitutes an established method&#xD;
      of noninvasive assessment of cerebral autoregulation and provides the capability of&#xD;
      semiquantitative assessment of regional cerebral blood flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the context of a multicenter randomized clinical trial (RCT) evaluating the effect of&#xD;
      steroids and antioxidants on the outcome of septic shock, we aim to assess cerebral&#xD;
      autoregulation and frontal cortex perfusion using NIRS in patients who will be enrolled in&#xD;
      the 25-bed intensive care unit (ICU) of Evaggelismos Hospital, Athens, Greece.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale of the main study is based on the following facts: A large body of experimental&#xD;
      data has demonstrated that both corticosteroids and intravenous vitamin C reduce activation&#xD;
      of nuclear factor kappa beta (NFƘB), thereby attenuating the release of pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      mediators. This may result in reduced endothelial permeability and improved macrocirculatory&#xD;
      flow, and augmentation of the release of endogenous catecholamines and enhanced vasopressor&#xD;
      responsiveness. Furthermore, a combined attenuation of the systemic inflammatory response,&#xD;
      reduced vascular leakage, and improved macrocirculatory flow may partly contribute to the&#xD;
      preservation of cerebral autoregulation and effective, regional brain perfusion. In addition,&#xD;
      recent evidence suggests that thiamine may be neuroprotective in severe shock states.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the rationale and hypotheses of the current substudy: Recent, observational data&#xD;
      suggest that impaired cerebral autoregulation is independently associated with 3-month&#xD;
      mortality in patients with septic shock. Therefore, the current project aims to test the&#xD;
      following hypotheses: 1) The steroids/vitamin C/thiamine intervention may result in&#xD;
      attenuation of the septic shock-associated impairment in cerebral autoregulation; and 2) The&#xD;
      increased frequency of intact cerebral autoregulation in the intervention group may result in&#xD;
      more neurologic failure free days and ventilator free days during a 60-day follow-up;&#xD;
      improved survival to hospital discharge with good functional outcome; and better&#xD;
      patient-reported health-related outcomes at 90-day follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIRS monitoring will be applied for 60 min at 2 levels of mean arterial pressure (MAP; ie,&#xD;
      65-70 mmHg and 95-100 mmHg) within 24-30 hours, and within 48-54 hours and 72-78 hours after&#xD;
      the diagnosis of the septic shock. Autoregulation will be assessed by using tissue&#xD;
      oxygenation index values and concurrently recorded MAP values in a regression analysis and&#xD;
      will be considered as adequate if the pertinent Pearson correlation coefficient is lower than&#xD;
      0.3. Cerebral blood flow will be assessed by determination of the blood flow index after&#xD;
      bolus injection of 5 mg of indocyanine green.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to the intervention or control group in subgroups of 4 using the&#xD;
      &quot;Research Randomizer&quot; software, version 4 (https://www.randomizer.org/). Substudy&#xD;
      intervention: In concordance with the main study protocol as approved by the Institutional&#xD;
      Review Board (IRB; ie, the Scientific Council) of Evaggelismos Hospital, Athens Greece, the&#xD;
      substudy intervention will comprise the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hydrocortisone: Hydrocortisone 50 mg initial/single bolus (5-mL syringe containing 50 mg of&#xD;
      hydrocortisone in normal saline), followed by a 24-hour continuous infusion of 200 mg/day for&#xD;
      4 days. The daily hydrocortisone dose of 200 mg will be diluted in a 50 or 100 mL bag of&#xD;
      normal saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hydrocortisone placebo will be provided as an identical syringe/50 or 100 mL bag of normal&#xD;
      saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin C: Vitamin C is provided by the manufacturer as a 50 mL vial at a concentration of&#xD;
      500mg/mL. Three (3) ml of the vitamin C solution will be diluted in a 50 or 100 mL bag of&#xD;
      normal saline (1500 mg vitamin C in a 50 mL bag) which will then be infused over 1 hour. The&#xD;
      bag will be labeled by the study's pharmacy team as &quot;vitamin C&quot;. The dosing schedule is 1500&#xD;
      mg every 6 hours for 4 days or until discharge from the ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin C placebo will consist of an identical bag of 50 or 100 mL normal saline (but with no&#xD;
      vitamin C) and will be labeled vitamin C. Placebo will be infused over 60 min as per the&#xD;
      infusion instructions of the active vitamin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thiamine: As a high percentage of septic patients have been shown to be thiamine-deficient,&#xD;
      patients will receive intravenous thiamine 200 mg every 12 hours for 4 days or until ICU&#xD;
      discharge. Thiamine is also a cofactor for the metabolism of oxalate (a byproduct of vitamin&#xD;
      C metabolism), with thiamine deficiency increasing oxalate levels. To simplify the study&#xD;
      protocol both the intervention and the control group will receive thiamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study inclusion and exclusion criteria are detailed in the dedicated subsections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOCUMENTATION AND PATIENT FOLLOW-UP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of patients over the first 10 days after randomization will include: 1)&#xD;
      Determination and recording of hemodynamic parameters and hemodynamic support, blood gases&#xD;
      and fluid balance over the previous 24 hours as well as arterial blood lactate and central&#xD;
      venous oxygen saturation; 2) Blood sampling at 24, 48 and 72 hours and 7 days after&#xD;
      randomization for determination of cytokines' concentrations; 3) Daily, routine laboratory&#xD;
      investigations' results and prescribed treatment data; 4) the results of 4 daily (1 / 6&#xD;
      hours) blood glucose measurements will be recorded and the incidence of hyperglycemia&#xD;
      (defined as blood glucose over 200 mg/dL) will be analyzed; 5) Daily calculation of the&#xD;
      Sequential Organ Dysfunction Assessment Score; and 6) The source of the infection, the&#xD;
      results of blood cultures and other biological specimen cultures, and the antibiograms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time to first cessation of vasopressor support will also be documented. Follow-up until&#xD;
      day 60 postresuscitation will include organ failure-free days and ventilator-free days.&#xD;
      Finally, the ICU length of stay, the hospital discharge date, and the morbidity and&#xD;
      complications / adverse events during hospital stay will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICU management protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All septic patients enrolled in this study will be managed by a standardized approach which&#xD;
      will comprise:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Empirical treatment with at least 2 broad spectrum antibiotics; antibiotic treatment&#xD;
           will be deescalated according to microbiological data and clinical improvement&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A conservative strategy of fluid management&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A lung-protective ventilation strategy&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Limited use of sedative agents according to pertinent guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Enteral nutrition which will be started at 24 hours after ICU admission&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Prophylaxis against deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis with both enoxaparin (or heparin&#xD;
           in patients with a calculated creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min) and sequential&#xD;
           compression/decompression stockings&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Permissive hyperglycemia (ie, blood glucose of 150-200 mg/dL)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study outcome measures are detailed in the dedicated subsection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation: The previously reported frequency of impaired cerebral&#xD;
      autoregulation is approximately 60% on day 2 after the diagnosis of sepsis/septic shock (3).&#xD;
      The detection of a study intervention-related halving of the aforementioned proportion with&#xD;
      an alpha value of 0.05 and a power of 0,80 would require the enrollment of 96 patients. As we&#xD;
      estimate that at least 100 patients will be enrolled at Evagglismos hospital in the context&#xD;
      of the steroids - vitamin C - thiamine multicenter RCT, we also propose a target enrollment&#xD;
      of 100 patients for the current substudy.&#xD;
&#xD;

      Options: Exact distribution Analysis: A priori: Compute required sample size Input: Tail(s) =&#xD;

      Allocation ratio N2/N1 = 1 Output: Sample size group 1 = 48 Sample size group 2 = 48 Total&#xD;
      sample size = 96 Actual power = 0.8004595 Actual α = 0.0290919&#xD;
&#xD;
      POSSIBLE SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY RESULTS: In view of encouraging preliminary data on the&#xD;
      corticosteroids / vitamin C, thiamine combination, we expect that the results of the current&#xD;
      study will further elucidate important mechanisms underlying the (speculated)&#xD;
      intervention-related benefit.&#xD;
