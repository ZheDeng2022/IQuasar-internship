  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Type 1 diabetes is one of the most common chronic illnesses among children and&#xD;
      adolescents. Although, intensive medical care is provided for these patients, some of them&#xD;
      have poor metabolic control. For example, only 21% of adolescents with type 1 diabetes in the&#xD;
      USA achieve the recommended average blood sugar concentration (HbA1c&lt;7.5%). This is a major&#xD;
      problem, since chronic hyperglycemia is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in type&#xD;
      1 diabetes and causes several serious complications, for example kidney failure, blindness,&#xD;
      and stroke. Therefore, the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes&#xD;
      (ISPAD) declared psychosocial factors, to be the most important risk factors of poor type 1&#xD;
      diabetes Management. Therefore, an instrument is needed to identify children and adolescents&#xD;
      with poor metabolic control in their course of disease as soon as possible. With an early&#xD;
      identification of such risk patients, better support can be provided. However, there is no&#xD;
      such instrument yet for pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes. To fill this gap, a&#xD;
      questionnaire (FEPB) based on the PAT 2.0© (Psychosocial Assessment Tool; an instrument used&#xD;
      in oncology) was developed for this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The aim of this project is to evaluate and validate a new instrument (FEPB) for an early&#xD;
      identification of children and adolescents with poor metabolic control in their course of&#xD;
      disease in a longitudinal design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: The sample consists of children and adolescents (age: 5-18 years), who were newly&#xD;
      diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (2-4 weeks ago), and who are in care at the University&#xD;
      Children's Hospital of Zurich. Structured interviews are conducted with the patients and the&#xD;
      parents are asked to fill out some questionnaires at two times: first, 2-4 weeks after the&#xD;
      diagnosis (T1) and second 6 month later (T2). With the new instrument (FEPB) a risk score can&#xD;
      be calculated for each patient at T1. Statistical analysis will be performed to determine&#xD;
      whether that risk score can predict which patients have poor metabolic control (HbA1c &gt; 7.5%)&#xD;
      at T2.&#xD;
