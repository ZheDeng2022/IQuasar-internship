      Determine the overall response rate (ORR) of bemcentinib plus chemotherapy&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bemcentinib inhibits pancreatic cancer proliferation as monotherapy and in combination with&#xD;
      gemcitabine through inhibition of the Axl pathway. The combination of&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine has encouraging signs of clinical activity in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic pancreatic cancer38. We would like to build on this combination in a biomarker&#xD;
      driven phase 1b/2 clinical trial of bemcentinib in nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine for patients&#xD;
      with metastatic pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
