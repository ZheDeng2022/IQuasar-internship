  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TCR-T cell therapy experienced a breakthrough for treating tumors in recent years. Phase I /&#xD;
      II trial of NY-ESO-1-specific TCR-T treatment for synovial sarcoma and melanoma conducted by&#xD;
      the Rosenberg team at the National Cancer Institute showed that 61% Synovial cell sarcoma and&#xD;
      55% melanoma had therapeutic responses. These and lots of clinical achievements indicate that&#xD;
      TCR-T cell therapy can target a variety of tumors including solid tumors without any severe&#xD;
      side effects found in CAR-T trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), a kinds of head-neck malignant tumor, which used to appear&#xD;
      mostly in southern China (especially in Fujian and Guangdong and Guangxi provinces). Most&#xD;
      patients with NPC show evidence of infection with the Epstein Barr virus (EBV) before or at&#xD;
      the time of their diagnosis. EBV is found in the cancer cells of almost all patients with&#xD;
      advanced stage NPC, and play a role in causing and inducing the disease program and&#xD;
      development. The cancer cells infected by EBV are able to hide from the body's immune system&#xD;
      and escape destruction. We want to see if EBV antigen special T cells (YT-E001) could&#xD;
      recognize and kill special parts of EBV infected cells, and finally inhibit the tumor&#xD;
      recurrence or metastasis of NPC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will focus on the NPC highly expressed EBV antigen such as LMP1, LMP2 and&#xD;
      EBNA1，the high affinity TCR target the above EBV antigen were screened from the healthy donor&#xD;
      using the sorting and single cell cloning technique. Then, using the lentivirus to transduce&#xD;
      the TCR gene to the autologous T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate the safety and tolerability of EBV-TCR-T cell therapy in subjects&#xD;
      with NPC who had received prior therapy for their disease but their disease has progressed or&#xD;
      relapsed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chemotherapy we will use for lymphodepletion is a combination of cyclophosphamide and&#xD;
      fludarabine. Cyclophosphamide and fludarabine are the chemotherapy agents most commonly used&#xD;
      for lymphodepletion in immunotherapy clinical trials.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase I/II study is designed as single dose pilot trial evaluating the safety and of&#xD;
      EBV-TCR-TT cell therapy in subjects with NPC who have received prior therapy for their&#xD;
      disease but the disease has progressed or relapsed. Anti-tumor activity and other exploratory&#xD;
      objectives will be assessed. Subjects enter from a Screening Protocol and are positive for&#xD;
      HLA- A02:01/24:02/11:01, and EBV serum positive. Subjects will receive cytoreductive&#xD;
      chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine on days -6 and -4 followed by infusion of&#xD;
      dose of about 2×108 EBV-TCR-T(YT-E001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will stay in hospital for safety and efficacy assessment daily from T cell infusion&#xD;
      (Day 0) through Day 7, and then weekly until week 4 and then at 8 weeks every 8 weeks until&#xD;
      progression of their disease or the end or termination of trial.&#xD;
