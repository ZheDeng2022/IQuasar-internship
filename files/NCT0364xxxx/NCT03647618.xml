  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This mutlicentre study at three hospitals in south Wales, UK, will be used to determine if&#xD;
      modern machine learning techniques can help the anaesthetist locate the target by&#xD;
      highlighting key anatomical features on the ultrasound image in real time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of two phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of Phase I is to train a computer-aided system to identify target structures in&#xD;
      regional anaesthesia when applied in the following categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adductor canal&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Popliteal&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fascia Iliaca&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rectus sheath&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Axillary The objective of Phase II is to estimate the success rate and safety of the&#xD;
           computer system being developed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Use of regional anaesthesia (RA) and peripheral nerve block (PNB) is growing, although&#xD;
      general anaesthesia (GA) is still more common in general surgical practice. Around 65% of all&#xD;
      procedures amenable to a regional technique currently use GA, and current UK National&#xD;
      Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance is that all regional anaesthesia&#xD;
      should be performed using ultrasound guidance. However, further increases in regional&#xD;
      anaesthesia are expected, as there are significant patient and economic benefits. In&#xD;
      particular, the per-procedure costs of regional anaesthesia are considerably less than for&#xD;
      general anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although growing, ultrasound-guided regional anaesthesia is difficult to learn and difficult&#xD;
      to perform. There are significant hand-eye-coordination issues as the clinician must&#xD;
      simultaneously manipulate both the needle and the ultrasound probe in order to guide the&#xD;
      needle to the target. In addition, both the needle and target anatomy can be very difficult&#xD;
      to see on the ultrasound image.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that a computer-aided system that highlights key anatomical&#xD;
      features on the ultrasound image would make this procedure safer for the patients and simpler&#xD;
      for the clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the leading method for automatic image segmentation uses deep learning, for which&#xD;
      many thousands of training images are required. There have been several successes in applying&#xD;
      these techniques to medical images, including ultrasound. However, it appears that relatively&#xD;
      little attention has been given to automatic segmentation of ultrasound images for regional&#xD;
      anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The closest reference to our proposed research describe a method to locate the median nerve&#xD;
      in ultrasound images of the forearm. There has also been a Kaggle challenge to segment the&#xD;
      brachial plexus nerves in the neck. Multiple anatomical regions can also be segmented at the&#xD;
      same time. However, none of these studies are directly applicable to clinical use as they&#xD;
      deal only with images captured from healthy volunteers. Neither do they consider how these&#xD;
      techniques could be used to aid anaesthetists performing regional anaesthesia in the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for this study is to determine whether real-time automatic highlighting of key&#xD;
      anatomical features can help clinicians perform ultrasound-guided regional anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medaphor's proposed system for automatic highlighting uses deep learning and requires many&#xD;
      thousands of images for the system to learn from. However, machine learning algorithms such&#xD;
      as deep-learning are highly dependent on the images used to construct them. In particular,&#xD;
      care must be taken to ensure these algorithms are trained using images representative of&#xD;
      those the algorithm will encounter when in use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A key part of regional anaesthesia involves injecting anaesthetic into the space near the&#xD;
      relevant nerve. Once introduced, both the needle and anaesthetic can be seen on the&#xD;
      ultrasound image. Models trained using non-invasive images recorded from healthy volunteers&#xD;
      will not be sufficient. Although non-invasive images from volunteers may contain the key&#xD;
      anatomical features, they will not show the needle and anaesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The simplest option to capture representative images is to select patients who will be having&#xD;
      regional anaesthesia and record the image data directly from the ultrasound machine as the&#xD;
      procedure is performed. This method of recording is transparent to both clinician and&#xD;
      patient, and does not affect the patient's treatment in any way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the ultrasound machines used for regional anaesthesia are not connected to PACS&#xD;
      and no patient identifiable information is entered into the ultrasound machine. Since the&#xD;
      ultrasound image only is recorded, the videos are completely anonymous and cannot be traced&#xD;
      back to any individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is part of a larger research programme and will build and validate a system&#xD;
      capable of highlighting the key anatomical features. Once the system is complete, a further&#xD;
      study will be conducted to test it in the clinic to determine potential benefits to patients&#xD;
      and clinicians.&#xD;
