  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2014, the french hospital emphasized the need for tools to screen for social fragility in&#xD;
      order to make explicit the choices of orientation of patients. To date, caregivers do not&#xD;
      have any tools or clinical benchmarks for individual assessment of pediatric social and&#xD;
      health vulnerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of the Health Care Access Permanence Services (PASS) is intended to facilitate access&#xD;
      to the health care system for people in precarious situations with care and social support&#xD;
      within and outside the institutions. health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis tested is that the use of a formalized tool makes it possible to improve the&#xD;
      detection of pediatric social vulnerability and to overcome reluctance to practice by a&#xD;
      simple, rapid and justified approach with regard to ongoing care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to validate a clinical tool for screening for pediatric social and&#xD;
      health vulnerability - Tool: VUlnerable Child (ENVU) -; to allow for an appropriate&#xD;
      orientation of the patient care pathway. The metrological validation of diagnostic&#xD;
      performances (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios) will be&#xD;
      studied in confrontation with the opinion of an expert caregiver in the care of vulnerable&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multicenter cross-sectional validation study of the screening tool will be conducted in&#xD;
      two SAUPs with a pediatric PASS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1000 children will be included in the centers for a period of 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the introduction of the ENVU tool and after an expert interview, three groups of&#xD;
      patients will be identified:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: no vulnerability according to expert with no indication of any PASS marker care&#xD;
      Group B: probable vulnerability according to the expert with indication of at least one PASS&#xD;
      marker care Group C: high vulnerability according to the expert with indication of at least&#xD;
      two care markers PASS Group B and C patients will be reviewed at 6 months for a second visit&#xD;
      to the ENVU tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main evaluation criterion will be the concordance between the indication of the use of&#xD;
      the PASS by the &quot;expert&quot; PASS nurse (indicator of a significant social and health&#xD;
      vulnerability) and the result of the ENVU tool.&#xD;

&#xD;
      The primary objective is to validate a clinical tool for screening for pediatric social and&#xD;

      studied in confrontation with the opinion of an expert caregiver in the care of vulnerable&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives will be to study the validity of the ENVU tool with regard to&#xD;
      pathologies epidemiologically associated with social vulnerability: hypotrophy, prematurity,&#xD;
      weight-loss disorders, school delay, asthma, skin infection, oral health, visual disturbances&#xD;
      not treatment, delayed immunization, over-consumption of unscheduled care in SAUP, iron&#xD;
      deficiency and lead poisoning (if research indicated by the reason for consultation). The&#xD;
      illustration of the added value of the PASS care will be observed by a before-after study of&#xD;
      the ENVU tool and the collected clinical data.&#xD;
