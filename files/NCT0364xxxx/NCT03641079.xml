  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arsenicosis is a major health problem in Bangladesh. Long term exposure of arsenic causes&#xD;
      keratosis of palm which reduce working capacity of patient. It also causes invasive skin&#xD;
      lesions like Bowen's disease which has a risk to develop squamous cell carcinoma. Brinjal&#xD;
      peel is well known for its antioxidant and anticancer properties. So this study will be&#xD;
      conducted to identify the compound from brinjal peel extract and to see its outcome on&#xD;
      keratosis and Bowen's disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Arsenicosis is a major health problem in Bangladesh. About half of the population are&#xD;
      chronically exposed to high concentration of arsenic through contaminated drinking water. In&#xD;
      arsenicosis, keratosis of palm and sole occur which reduce the working capacity of the&#xD;
      patient and affect the socioeconomic condition. It also causes invasive skin lesions like&#xD;
      Bowen's disease, squamous cell carcinoma, and basal cell carcinoma. Bowen's disease usually&#xD;
      appears as a persistent reddened scaly patch on the skin and has a risk (3-5%) to develop&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma. Keratosis can be treated by different topical preparations like&#xD;
      salicylic acid, propylene glycol and oral antioxidant, zinc and folic acid, but treatment by&#xD;
      these medicines require a longer time to relieve and thus reduce patient's compliance. On the&#xD;
      other hand, treatment options available for Bowen's disease are expensive. Brinjal is a&#xD;
      common vegetable which contains steroidal alkaloids, steroidal glycosides, delphinidine,&#xD;
      nasunin and other biologically active compounds. These biologically active compounds are&#xD;
      effective against human cancer cells by various mechanisms. One study shows that a topical&#xD;
      cream prepared from brinjal peel extract is effective in keratosis and skin carcinoma. So,&#xD;
      this study will be conducted to see the outcome of brinjal peel extract in severe palmar&#xD;
      arsenical keratosis and Bowen's disease and to identify the compound that is responsible for&#xD;
      the effect. The study will be an Open Phase- II Clinical Trial. It will be conducted in&#xD;
      Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University and Bhanga Upazilla of Faridpur District.&#xD;
      Extracts from brinjal peel will be collected by using a mixture of ethanol, chloroform and&#xD;
      acetic acid as a solvent in Soxhlet extractor and rotary evaporator. Thin Layer&#xD;
      Chromatography (TLC), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Infrared (IR) of extract will be&#xD;
      done to identify compound. Cytotoxicity assay will be done by using brine shrimp bioassay.&#xD;
      Then a topical cream will be prepared from the extract and supplied at the field level&#xD;
      through a temporary arsenic clinic at an interval of two weeks. Instruction will be given to&#xD;
      the patients about applying the cream. Adherence and adverse effects of the cream will be&#xD;
      monitored regularly through phone calls and during each visit. Photograph will be taken and&#xD;
      size of the keratotic nodules as well as, lesions of Bowen's disease will be measured before&#xD;
      the start and after completion of treatment. Clinical improvement will be assessed by the&#xD;
      mean scoring of nodules and lesions and perception of patients about their improvement by&#xD;
      using Likert Scale. Statistical analysis and results will be presented in tabulated forms and&#xD;
      in different diagrams.&#xD;
