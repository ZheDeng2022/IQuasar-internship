  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to assess the expression of innate lymphoid cells in the&#xD;
      esophageal mucosa of children with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and in control subjects&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children (aged 1 to 18 years) presenting with symptoms suggestive of EoE and requiring an&#xD;
      upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with biopsies of the esophageal mucosa in order to confirm&#xD;
      or exclude the diagnosis of EoE will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children paired for age in whom an endoscopy performed to explore symptoms of EoE revealed&#xD;
      another condition (peptic oesophagitis, achalasia), or children paired for age in whom an&#xD;
      endoscopy with biopsies has been performed to explore chronic abdominal or epigastric pain or&#xD;
      suspected chronic inflammatory bowel disease, will be include as control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endoscopy will be performed under general anaesthesia using a flexible endoscope with an&#xD;
      external diameter of between 4.9 and 9.2 mm, depending on the size of the child. In line with&#xD;
      the guidelines, eight biopsies will be collected from the proximal, median and distal&#xD;
      oesophagus for the routine analysis of esophageal remodelling and inflammation. Three of&#xD;
      these biopsies will be used in the context of this study to analyse innate immune cells using&#xD;
      flow cytometry and to determine the profile of cytokine expression. Two biopsies will be&#xD;
      placed in sterile, 0.5 ml Nunc tubes containing a storage buffer (MACS® Tissue Storage&#xD;
      Solution) and then stored in ice until the extraction of cells for cytometric analysis. The&#xD;
      third specimen will be placed in a sterile tube and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen for&#xD;
      analyses of the esophageal microbiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ILC1, 2 and 3 and their sub-types will be identified by means of structural criteria (size&#xD;
      and granularity) and differential membrane and intracellular labelling using the specific&#xD;
      markers shown below. All acquisitions and analyses will be achieved using a 13-colour&#xD;
      NovoCyte cytometer (AACEA) and its associated software (NovoAxpressTM), which are available&#xD;
      in the laboratory.&#xD;

    <description>Analyses of the composition of the esophageal microbiome will be performed using 16S rDNA sequencing after the extraction of DNA according to published protocols and/or using commercial kits (QlAamp DNA stool Mini Kit; QIAGEN). The pyrosequencing of 16S DNA, the identification of groups and phyla and initial biostatistical analyses will be carried out by specialised platforms.</description>
