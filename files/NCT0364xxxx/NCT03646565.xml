  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, improvement of medical treatments leads to the effect, that 90% of children&#xD;
      originally born with congenital heart disease (CHD) are reaching adulthood. Mortality rates&#xD;
      have significantly decreased in the last decades. However several studies have shown that&#xD;
      with multiple consequences have to face the survivors. Eg. neuronal and psychological&#xD;
      injuries during the perioperative period. After all, the surgical interventions that save&#xD;
      their lives might result in psychological and behavioral deviations and increased morbidity,&#xD;
      which is strongly worsening the quality of life, learning abilities and behavioral&#xD;
      development of these patients. Not yet available any clinical guidelines for managing or&#xD;
      screening these patients for designing intervention, taking corrective actions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators wish to identify those perioperative factors that might affect the&#xD;
      well-being, coping, the behavior alteration and psychosocial status of children, who&#xD;
      underwent open chest cardiac interventions in early ages. The investigators also wish to&#xD;
      understand the long-term changes of the illness-representation of this population and to see&#xD;
      its effect for the wellbeing and coping.&#xD;

      The study population will include school-aged children treated and followed in the Gottsegen&#xD;
      György Hungarian Institute of Cardiology in Budapest. The participants will be selected from&#xD;
      patients who underwent open-chest cardiac surgery, under the age of four, between 2003- 2007&#xD;
      and once followed up in 2013-2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychosocial measures will be as follows: Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Spielberger&#xD;
      State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S/T), KidScreen questionnaire, PRISM-D and person/organ&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A range of perioperative and psychosocial factors will be assessed as potential determinants&#xD;
      of outcome. The data will be fully retrieved from the registries of our hospital center.&#xD;
      Characteristics registered included pre-, intra- and postoperative variables such as age,&#xD;
      gender, comorbidities (renal, hepatic, infectious, neurological, metabolic, hormonal or&#xD;
      genetic disorders), type of surgery, laboratory parameters, operation time, cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      bypass (CPB) time, aortic cross-clamp time, Risk Assessment for Congenital Heart Surgery&#xD;
      (RACHS) points, length of mechanical ventilation, blood loss, transfusions, fluid balance,&#xD;
      need for inotropic support or pulmonary vasodilatation, medications, anaesthetic and&#xD;
      analgesic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By comparing the above mentioned perioperative data with the result of the psychological&#xD;
      measures we expect to answer our hypothesis.&#xD;

    <measure>Illness representation measured with PRISM-D and person/organ test</measure>
    <time_frame>11-15 years after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>PRISM-D; person/organ test: both used for illness representation. Patients is given to a landscape oriented a4 white paper with a yellow circle on the left down corner. The Investigator ask the patient to imagine that the white paper his/her life and the yellow circle is him/herself. Than patient instructed to first draw another circle with red that represent him/her illness. Than the investigator asks him/her to draw all the people and things important to him/her at this very moment in his life by using different colors. Scored based on the distance, size, etc.&#xD;
According to the person/organ test' instruction the patient first have to draw him/herself, than his/her heart. Based on the location of the organ, and it's distance from the body scoring is made.</description>
