  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of smoking among US adults is highest among American Indians and Alaska Native&#xD;
      (AI/AN) persons; however, there are a lack of tobacco cessation interventions developed&#xD;
      specific to this disparity group. Social media holds promise as a scalable intervention&#xD;
      strategy to promote engagement in treatment and cessation outcomes for Alaska Native (AN)&#xD;
      people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers plan to develop and pilot test a culturally relevant, Facebook delivered&#xD;
      intervention to promote smoking treatment uptake and cessation among AN smokers. The Facebook&#xD;
      content will include a digital storytelling approach adapted from the effective Centers for&#xD;
      Disease Control (CDC) Tips from Former Smokers educational mass media campaign. The project&#xD;
      builds on the researcher team's longstanding tobacco control research partnership with the AN&#xD;
      community and was informed by their understanding of cultural factors that can both impede&#xD;
      and encourage cessation in this population. If the pilot intervention is successful,&#xD;
      researchers will have a blueprint to conduct a large randomized controlled trial. The&#xD;
      researchers long-term objective is to develop interventions for AN tobacco users that will&#xD;
      ultimately reduce their risk of tobacco-caused disease and mortality.&#xD;

      The Behavioral Health Research Program at Mayo Clinic will be coordinating the study&#xD;
      (recruit, train, oversee, etc.), but the project will take place in Alaska. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted at the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium (ANTHC) in Anchorage. All data&#xD;
      collection and the intervention will be conducted by study staff at ANTHC and Mayo Clinic.&#xD;
      For qualitative data collection, a semi-structured interviewer guide will be developed and&#xD;
      the project coordinator in Alaska will conduct the interviews. Researchers will provide&#xD;
      training for the project coordinator on-site in Anchorage including 4 hours of didactic&#xD;
      instruction followed by 4 practice hours of mock interviews and a certified completion&#xD;
      interview. All sessions will be audiotaped. These transcripts will be coded by the&#xD;
      researchers to assess counselor adherence to the proscribed intervention, and feedback will&#xD;
      be provided during weekly research team teleconferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mayo Clinic social media department will create the Facebook group page, develop the content&#xD;
      library of moderator postings, and set up the software to capture participant use data. A&#xD;
      random sample of 20% of moderator postings and responses to participant inquiries and&#xD;
      discussions will be selected every week for the first four weeks and monthly thereafter.&#xD;
      These transcripts will be coded by the researchers to assess moderator adherence to the&#xD;
      proscribed intervention, and feedback will be provided during weekly research team&#xD;
      teleconferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A manual of study procedures will be developed for the project coordinator in Alaska (AK). A&#xD;
      Mayo Clinic program coordinator and clinical trials coordinator, will travel with a Mayo&#xD;
      Clinic Co-Investigator to Anchorage, AK, to train the project coordinator on the data&#xD;
      collection and other study procedures. The same coordination, communication, and quality&#xD;
      control procedures will be used that have been successfully utilized in previous work. For&#xD;
      ongoing trials in Alaska, weekly conference calls are scheduled with study staff in AK and at&#xD;
      Mayo Clinic to discuss progress and problem solve issues related to recruitment and data&#xD;
      collection. Quality control of the data is also monitored on site through review of&#xD;
      participant forms and procedures every 3 months. The biostatistician on this protocol will&#xD;
      oversee the transfer of data forms, electronic data, and data storage. The Mayo Survey&#xD;
      Research Center will electronically transfer all data to the biostatistician. The quality of&#xD;
      the data (data checks) including missing data and presence and frequency of outliers will be&#xD;
      monitored once per month by the biostatistician. For study recruitment, the project&#xD;
      coordinator will track posting of ads through Facebook (FB) and in Alaska local newsletters&#xD;
      and websites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All measures will be administered online using Qualtrics software, a data security service.&#xD;
      An email link will be sent automatically by the Mayo Clinic Survey Research Center to&#xD;
      complete the assessment. If a participant does not complete online assessments, the&#xD;
      participant will be contacted through email or by phone by the project coordinator and&#xD;
      prompted to complete the assessment. Data collected from survey responses will be handled and&#xD;
      maintained by the Mayo Clinic Survey Research Center and a de-identified database of&#xD;
      responses will be provided to the investigators. Interview forms and audio tapes will be&#xD;
      labeled with subject ID numbers only; all personal identifiers will be removed before the&#xD;
      data are sent to Mayo Clinic for analysis. At Mayo Clinic the audio tapes will be stored in a&#xD;
      locked file drawer accessible only to the PI, Co-Investigator, and the project coordinator.&#xD;
      These will be destroyed once the interviews are fully transcribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A trained research assistant at Mayo Clinic will mail the saliva sample kit to the&#xD;
      participant; and the saliva samples, labeled with a subject identifier (ID) number only, will&#xD;
      be shipped directly back to Mayo Clinic for analysis of cotinine. Once the specimen sample is&#xD;
      processed and results posted, the sample will be destroyed immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study staff in Anchorage and Rochester will monitor any reports or observations of&#xD;
      medical problems or severe depression or other psychiatric symptoms in participants. The&#xD;
      Principal Investigator (PI) and a Co-Investigator from Stanford University, licensed clinical&#xD;
      psychologists, will be consulted by telephone to consult with the study staff as needed.&#xD;
