  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tests the effectiveness of dietary interventions that have the possibility to&#xD;
      improve markers of gut health and improve general well-being. This study will allow&#xD;
      healthcare professionals to learn how dietary interventions involving fasting can affect&#xD;
      health. Food is increasingly recognized as a core component of preventive and ameliorative&#xD;
      health care. Juice fasting has quickly become one of the most popular self-prescribed dietary&#xD;
      interventions in the United States. A wide variety of juice fasts are available in the&#xD;
      popular market; a popular variation is the three-day juice fast. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to assess the effects of a three-day juice fast on certain markers of age-related disease and&#xD;
      bio-markers of longevity. In particular, this study will assess certain epigenetic markers,&#xD;
      which measure how the environment (including diet) can change the way that genes are&#xD;
      expressed without changing the genes themselves. The study will also assess the microbiome,&#xD;
      and inflammatory and glycemic markers.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 30 participants will be enrolled in the study and will be randomized into one of the&#xD;
      three arms: the &quot;juice fasting&quot; arm, the &quot;juice plus ad hoc&quot; arm, and the &quot;caloric&#xD;
      restriction&quot; arm. Participants will come into the lab for an initial visit, during which they&#xD;
      will complete questionnaires on their usual diet and demographics and will be informed about&#xD;
      their assignment to one of the three arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all three arms, the three-day diet intervention will be preceded and followed by three&#xD;
      days of self-conducted elimination diet. The pre-intervention diet will encourage&#xD;
      participants to eat a healthy, light diet for three days (basic instructions: eat only fresh&#xD;
      raw or cooked fruits and vegetables (preferably organic), whole grains and eggs; drink 8&#xD;
      glasses of water a day; avoid or eliminate alcohol, caffeine, sugar, processed foods, dairy,&#xD;
      red meat, and gluten). The post- intervention diet will instruct participants to gradually&#xD;
      return to eating solid foods, and limit strenuous exercise (basic instructions: follow a diet&#xD;
      similar to the pre-intervention elimination diet; day 1 after the intervention: eat fruits &amp;&#xD;
      green vegetables, and drink 8 glasses of water; day 2 add in: nuts, gluten-free grains like&#xD;
      whole oats, quinoa, or brown rice; day 3 add in: organic meats, fish, &amp; gluten-containing&#xD;
      grains).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological samples and self-reported outcomes will be collected at four time points: baseline&#xD;
      (prior to the first elimination diet period), pre-intervention (after the elimination diet&#xD;
      and before the three-day intervention), post-intervention (after the intervention), and&#xD;
      14-day post- intervention. At each time point, participants will complete questionnaire on&#xD;
      quality of life (PROMIS - Global Health Scale, which is an NIH measure on an individual's'&#xD;
      overall physical and psychological well-being; see appendix) and collect their stool samples.&#xD;
      Participants will be provided self-administered tool kits and be taught how to collect the&#xD;
      stool sample at their first lab visit. At each of the four time points, the research&#xD;
      assistant will coordinate the collection of cheek swabs, saliva samples, and blood spot&#xD;
      samples. Biometrics will also be collected at each time point (weight, waist circumference,&#xD;
      and blood pressure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the course of the study, participants will be instructed to keep a diet diary days one&#xD;
      through nine to record their daily dietary intake. During the intervention period, the&#xD;
      research team will also contact the participants for daily check-ins. Participants will not&#xD;
      need to record diet data for the remaining 11 days of the post-intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of the study, participants will bring back the final biological samples&#xD;
      (stool wipe and saliva), provide the set of samples, and be debriefed about the purposes of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biological samples collected will then be processed and assayed for microbiome,&#xD;
      methylation, inflammatory markers, and glycemic markers.&#xD;
