    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of conventional speech therapy associated with&#xD;
      functional electrical stimulation in patients with dysphagia after ischemic stroke. Included&#xD;
      patients will be divided into two groups, where in the intervention group the speech therapy&#xD;
      is associated to functional electrical stimulation, and in the control group, the patients&#xD;
      will receive the conventional speech therapy with electrical stimulation Placebo with&#xD;
      intensity 0hz.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since the 1980's, electrical stimulation has been used for therapeutic purposes in Brazil,&#xD;
      and, since 1990's, it has been used as a relevant therapeutic tool in the cases of&#xD;
      oropharyngeal dysphagia in addition to speech therapy. Positive results have been observed in&#xD;
      the treatment of swallowing disorders, including in patients that carry neurological&#xD;
      diseases. However, there is no substantial evidences for this interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the electrotherapy will be used as a complement to conventional speech therapy&#xD;
      and performed the application of electrical stimulation protocol in dysphagia, through the&#xD;
      apparatus Neurodyn Portable TENS/FES (transcutaneous electrical neurostimulation/ functional&#xD;
      electrical stimulation), which is a transcutaneous neuromuscular stimulator flow TENS/FES&#xD;
      from two channels with independent intensity adjustment. It is about a non-invasive technique&#xD;
      with no systemic effect, causing no dependence or undesirable side effects, and consists by&#xD;
      gentle application in electrical stimulation, through electrodes placed in body areas&#xD;
      affected by pain or to activate skeletal muscles and produce movements. A channel of&#xD;
      electrodes will be placed in the submental region and the other channel on the thyroid&#xD;
      cartilage., in formation of a T. The explication of the procedure in the patient treatment,&#xD;
      is describing the sensations that he should expect that happened during the stimulation. The&#xD;
      intensity of necessary flow to apply in the treatment, will depend in the sensation of the&#xD;
      patient, therefore, it is applicable until the tolerance level or desirable muscular&#xD;
      contraction. Thus, the treatment should be initiated with minimal levels of intensity, by&#xD;
      being carefully raised if appropriate effects are achieved on the procedure and according to&#xD;
      the patient report.&#xD;

    <description>Anatomical Evaluation:Tongue, palate, pharynx, larynx - normal or specify changes&#xD;
Functional Evaluation:&#xD;
Mobility (lips/tongue), tongue's sensitivity, palatine veil's closure - adequate or inadequate&#xD;
Pharynx - salivary/alimentary stasis&#xD;
Larynx - normal, decreased mobility, unilateral or bilateral immobility&#xD;
Deglutition assessment (liquid, thick, pasty and solid foods):&#xD;
-Delay of swallowing, anterior/posterior escape, stasis in vallecula/pyriform sinuses, laryngeal penetration, laryngotracheal aspiration - present or absent&#xD;
Functional swallowing: alteration in anatomical or functional evaluation with absence of salivary/alimentary stasis Mild dysphagia: there is also salivary or food stasis in only one consistency with efficient maneuvers such as lowered head, Masako or effortless swallowing Moderate dysphagia: there is also laryngeal penetration to one or more consistencies Severe dysphagia: there is also laryngotracheal aspiration or absence of swallowing reflex</description>

    <description>Measured by the Functional Oral Ingestion Scale (FOIS). FOIS results are rated on a scale of 1 to 7 levels. The levels will increase according to the safe amount of oral diet ingested by the patient safely.&#xD;
Level1 - nothing by mouth; Level 2 - tube dependent with minimal attempts of Food or liquid; Level 3 - tube dependent with consistence oral Intake of Food or liquid; Level 4 - total oral diet of a single consistency; Level 5 - total oral diet with multiple consistencies but requiring special preparation or compensations; Level 6 - total oral diet with multiplex consistencies without special preparation, but with specific Food limitations; Level 7 - total oral diet with no restrictions.</description>

Captation, anterior and posterior escape, cough reflex and gagging- present or absent&#xD;
Oral transit time, number of swallowing, laryngeal elevation- adequate or inadequate&#xD;
Voice normal or &quot;wet&quot;&#xD;
Functional swallowing- there are changes that do not compromise safe feeding as reduced sensitivity (intra-oral or facial), anterior escape due to small anatomical or functional changes Mild dysphagia- multiple swallowing, inadequate laryngeal elevation, &quot;wet&quot; voice but cough reflex efficient Moderate dysphagia- multiple swallowing, inadequate laryngeal elevation, &quot;wet&quot; voice, weak cough reflex and gagging one or more consistencies Severe dysphagia- when there is no evidence of coughing, swallowing reflexes or gagging difficult to recover</description>
