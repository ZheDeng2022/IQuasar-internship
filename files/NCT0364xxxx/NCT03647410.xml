  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients of unilaterally displaced sacral fractures fixed with lumbopelvic technique or novel&#xD;
      adjustable plate from June 2011 to June 2017 were recruited into this study and were divided&#xD;
      into two groups: group A (lumbopelvic fixation) and groups B (novel adjustable plate).&#xD;
      Surgical time, intraoperative blood loss, frequency of intraoperative fluoroscopy, reduction&#xD;
      quality, related complications were reviewed. Fracture healing was assessed by the&#xD;
      radiographs conducted at follow-up. Functional outcome was evaluated according to the Majeed&#xD;
      score at the final follow-up.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients of unilateral displaced sacral fractures from June 2011 to June 2017 were recruited&#xD;
      into this study. The inclusion criteria were as follows: 18-65 years, with normal activity&#xD;
      ability before injury, fixed with lumbopelvic technique or novel adjustable plate, completed&#xD;
      more than a year follow-up. The exclusion criteria were as follows: pathologic fractures,&#xD;
      open fractures, associated with other severe injuries (traumatic brain injury), risk factors&#xD;
      affecting bone healing (osteoporosis, smoking, and metabolic diseases) and non-completion of&#xD;
      one-year follow-up. Surgical time, intraoperative blood loss, frequency of intraoperative&#xD;
      fluoroscopy, related complications were reviewed. Reduction quality was assessed on the&#xD;
      postoperative radiographs and CT scans. Functional outcome was evaluated according to the&#xD;
      Majeed score system at the final follow-up.&#xD;
