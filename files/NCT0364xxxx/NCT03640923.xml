  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is necessary to better understand the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#xD;
      genome sequences by gametes without replication-competent virus transmission. In fact, HIV&#xD;
      endogenization could be protective. Some studies are supporting this hypothesis, one shew the&#xD;
      presence of HIV genome sequences in spermatozoa, and others show that HIV-positive &quot;Elite&#xD;
      controllers&quot; patients have HIV genome sequences without a replication competent virus. One&#xD;
      study found HIV genome sequences without a replication-competent virus in the cells of an&#xD;
      HIV-negative child whose mother is a non-sick HIV-positive. We will conduct a prospective&#xD;
      descriptive and analytical study over a period of 2 years, from September 2018 to November&#xD;
      2020. We will explore by FISH method in the IHU Méditerranée-Infection laboratory, Marseille,&#xD;
      the presence or absence of HIV genome sequences without a replication-competent virus in&#xD;
      epithelial cells of children with parents are infected by HIV. Children included must be&#xD;
      under 12 months of age, followed at Robert Debré Hospital, Paris or Timone Enfant Hospital,&#xD;
      Marseille because of a parental HIV infection. They must have the recommended blood tests to&#xD;
      assess their HIV status and the parents consent should be written. Subsequent progression to&#xD;
      HIV infection or not will be followed and a statistical study will be conducted to establish&#xD;
      a link between the presence of endogenized HIV genome sequences in epithelial cells and the&#xD;
      developpement or not of HIV infection.&#xD;
