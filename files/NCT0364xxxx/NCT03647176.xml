    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer remains the third most common cause of death from cancer worldwide.&#xD;
      Colonoscopy allows removal of adenomatous polyps is the best colorectal cancer screening,&#xD;
      according to the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Recent studies have reported approximately 30%&#xD;
      of interval cancer may be incomplete polyp resection. Complete polyp resection may be&#xD;
      particularly important when implementing new methods for surveillance colonoscopies. Cold&#xD;
      snare polypectomy (CSP) is considered to be a safer procedure for removing subcentimeter&#xD;
      lesions than conventional hot snare polypectomy (HSP). CSP removal of polyps sized ≤5 mm have&#xD;
      recommended by the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline as the preferred&#xD;
      technique. Previous report said that the complete resection rate of CSP for adenomatous&#xD;
      polyps 4-9 mm in size was comparable to that of HSP, and in the foreseeable future CSP can be&#xD;
      one of the standard techniques for 4-9 mm colorectal polyps. However, data on complete&#xD;
      resection of colorectal polyps 1.0-1.5 mm in size is sparse. Investigators are interested in&#xD;
      comparison of the resection rate of cold snare polypectomy for large (10-15 mm) and small&#xD;
      (5-9 mm) colorectal polyps using CSP.&#xD;

      Participantswho meet inclusion criteria will be asked to participate, investigators will&#xD;
      include all patients with resectable polyps, but only adenomatous polyps will be included for&#xD;
      analysis. See also inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colonoscopy, after bowel preparation with polyethylene glycol solution was performed using&#xD;
      standard colonoscopes (CF-HQ290I, CF-Q260AI) and polypectomy snares(13mm Captivator and 10mm&#xD;
      Captivator II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures were performed by experienced endoscopists (each with over 1000 colonoscopies&#xD;
      performed) including CSP. All polyps between 5 and 15mm will be removed with a polypectomy&#xD;
      snare. Polyp size will be measured using the tip of the snare catheter (2.5mm). Difficulty of&#xD;
      resection will be grade by polyp resection time. Following the resection, jet stream of water&#xD;
      will be used to wash mucosal defect thoroughly. After endoscopist's attestation that polyp&#xD;
      removal was complete by carefully observe the resection margins with near focus mode, for&#xD;
      large lesions (10-15mm) 4 biopsies will be performed from all four quadrants of resection&#xD;
      margins, for small lesions (5-9mm) biopsies were performed from two marginal sites located&#xD;
      symmetrically on the left and right of the mucosal defects to confirm residual polyp tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If polyp resection is complicated by bleeding (not self-sustained), no biopsies will be taken&#xD;
      and any additional polyps that will be found during the remaining examination will be&#xD;
      excluded from analysis. Severe bleeding that will complicate resection margins examination&#xD;
      will be excluded from analysis, Endoscopic haemostasis will be performed when active&#xD;
      haemorrhage continued for ≥30s.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single research subject may have many eligible polyps. To avoid taking many biopsies, the&#xD;
      investigators will not include more than 5 eligible polyps (the first 5 that are detected)&#xD;
      per patient in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The polyps will be evaluated by experienced pathologists according to Vienna classification.&#xD;
      Resection margins for each polyp will be recorded as: R0= adenomatous tissue free,&#xD;
      R1=adenomatous tissue detection. Investigators will only include adenomatous polyps in the&#xD;
      analysis. for financial requests of the resection margin biopsies. The pathological diagnosis&#xD;
      of the biopsies will become part of the medical record. If biopsies contain adenomatous&#xD;
      tissue the participants will be ask to return for a follow-up colonoscopy within six month.&#xD;
