  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Personal Resilience Empowerment Program (PREP) at Hackensack Meridian Integrative Health&#xD;
      &amp; Medicine was designed in Legacy Meridian to assist all selected patients with upcoming&#xD;
      hospitalization. For the &quot;Personal Resilience Empowerment Program (PREP) in the perioperative&#xD;
      setting of surgically treated cancer patients&quot;, hereafter &quot;the Project or PREP&quot;, the&#xD;
      Hackensack Meridian Integrative Health &amp; Medicine is designing a new pilot program to focus&#xD;
      on the needs of oncology patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients diagnosed with cancer that will undergo a scheduled surgical (Hepato-Biliary,&#xD;
      and Thoracic) procedure in Hackensack Meridian Health and specifically in the Jersey Shore&#xD;
      University Medical Center, will be eligible to participate (for more details please see&#xD;
      eligibility criteria, section 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, this pilot project will include 5 coaching sessions and an introductory&#xD;
      session/visit that will take place on the physician's office. The initial physician visit&#xD;
      will focus on patient eligibility, introduction to the Project, informed consent and a&#xD;
      pre-intervention survey and will be conducted by the principal investigator or one of the&#xD;
      sub-investigators listed above. The following 5 sessions will be conducted by one of the&#xD;
      integrative health coaches/registered nurses (for details please see section 5). A&#xD;
      post-intervention survey will be completed during the final session and repeated at one&#xD;
      month, and at 3 months from the final session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this project is to investigate whether using the PREP as an intervention in&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with cancer would result in improving various metrics including&#xD;
      improvements to resilience, sleep, activity, purpose, nutrition, empowerment to manage one's&#xD;
      own health and well-being, decrease in pain medication use and more rapid return to previous&#xD;
      functional status according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG).&#xD;
