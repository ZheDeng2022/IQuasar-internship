      Based on the theory of intestinal lung axis, the effect of new therapy on patients with&#xD;
      advanced NSCLC was observed by adjusting the intestinal micro-ecology and combining existing&#xD;
      platinum-based doublet chemotherapy.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes To compare progression free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR)&#xD;
      in patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer receiving Bifico versus placebo&#xD;
      plus platinum-based doublet chemotherapy for first-line treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes To compare overall survival (OS) between the two arms； To evaluate the&#xD;
      nature, severity, and frequency of toxicities between arms； To correlate the blood markers&#xD;
      and fecal microbiome (at diagnosis) with outcomes and response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Patients are&#xD;
      stratified according to center, performance status (0 or 1), tobacco use (never vs past or&#xD;
      present), weight loss (&lt; 5% vs ≥ 5% or unknown). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment&#xD;
      arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIFICO Group: Patients receive Bifico (420mg, 3 times a day, p.o) plus platinum-based doublet&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Chemotherapy repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo Group: Patients receive placebo (420mg, 3 times a day, p.o) plus platinum-based&#xD;
      doublet chemotherapy. Chemotherapy repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood, tissue and fecal samples are collected and examined for biomarkers, gene mutations and&#xD;
      fecal microbiome, and may be banked for future studies.&#xD;
