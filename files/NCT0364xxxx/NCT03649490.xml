      This study is being conducted to evaluate the clinical and radiographic outcomes of three&#xD;
      different interbody implant types when used with cancellous allograft chips with BMA or&#xD;
      cellular allograft in patients undergoing XLIF surgery. The study will evaluate success by&#xD;
      comparing the rate of fusion, complications profile, and any relationships between clinical&#xD;
      outcomes (pain and function) and radiographic outcomes (fusion rate) between the three&#xD;
      implant groups.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective, non-concurrent, multicenter study to compare the clinical and&#xD;
      radiographic outcomes of smooth PEEK, 3D-printed titanium, and Porous PEEK interbody implants&#xD;
      when used with cancellous allograft chips with BMA or cellular allograft in subjects who&#xD;
      undergo XLIF surgery at one or two levels. To minimize selection bias, all consecutive&#xD;
      patients at a given site who meet eligibility requirements will be asked to consent to&#xD;
      participate in the study. These patients will present with degenerative conditions in the&#xD;
      lumbar spine that are amenable to surgical treatment and will be screened prior to study&#xD;
      enrollment. Once enrolled into the study, subjects will undergo their XLIF operation using&#xD;
      one of the 3 previously noted interbody implants based on a non-concurrent enrollment&#xD;
      schedule. The bone graft material used inside the interbody implant will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      between cancellous allograft chips with BMA or cellular allograft prior to surgery based on&#xD;
      surgeon investigators' equipoise for the effectiveness of both bone graft materials. Subjects&#xD;
      will be followed for 24 months following surgery to determine the number of study subjects&#xD;
      that are solidly fused at or before 24 months postoperatively.&#xD;

    <arm_group_label>Smooth PEEK Interbody Implants in XLIF</arm_group_label>
    <description>Smooth PEEK interbody implants for XLIF (with allograft chips and BMA or cancellous allograft) provide maximum surface area and structural stability with large central apertures to allow bony through-growth. Multiple length options enable optimal apophyseal support, thus reducing the chance of subsidence. Additionally, lordotic profiles are available to induce proper sagittal alignment.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>3D-Printed Titanium Interbody Implants in XLIF</arm_group_label>
    <description>3D-printed, fully porous titanium interbody implants for XLIF (with allograft chips and BMA or cancellous allograft) have a porous architecture that mimics the porosity and stiffness of bone for reduced stress shielding and improved radiographic imaging. The advanced microporous surface topography creates an ideal environment for bone in-growth.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Porous PEEK Interbody Implants in XLIF</arm_group_label>
    <description>Porous PEEK interbody implants for XLIF (with allograft chips and BMA or cancellous allograft) combine the osseointegration capabilities of porous metal implants with the favorable imaging and mechanical properties of traditional PEEK implants. The Porous PEEK architecture, with 60% porosity and 300 mm average pore size, is specifically tailored to elicit the optimal osteogenic cell response and promote bone tissue ingrowth inside the pores, as demonstrated in preclinical studies.</description>
