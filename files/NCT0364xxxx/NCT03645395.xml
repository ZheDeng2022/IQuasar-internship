      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of MT-3724 in&#xD;
      combination with Lenalidomide in subjects with relapsed or refractory B-Cell NHL.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label two-part study evaluating the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      MT-3724 in combination with Lenalidomide in relapsed or refractory CD20 positive B-cell&#xD;
      Lymphoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: (MT-3724 Dose Escalation) Define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MT-3724 in&#xD;
      combination with standard treatment of Lenalidomide&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: (MTD Expansion Cohort) Confirm the safety and tolerability of the MTD of MT-3724 from&#xD;
      Part 1 in the MTD Expansion Cohort, where MT-3724 will be given at the MTD in combination&#xD;
      with Lenalidomide. In addition, the PK, PD, immunogenicity and tumor response at the MTD of&#xD;
      MT-3724 in combination with Lenalidomide will be more thoroughly evaluated in Part 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that up to 64 patients will be enrolled. Treatment will continue until&#xD;
      disease progression, withdrawal of consent or any other reason.&#xD;
