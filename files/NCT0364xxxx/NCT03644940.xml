      The focus of this study will be to conduct a prospective, randomized controlled trial (RCT)&#xD;
      at Cape Regional Medical Center (CRMC), Oroville Hospital (OH), and UCSF Medical Center&#xD;
      (UCSF) in which a subpopulation-optimized algorithm will be applied to EHR data for the&#xD;
      detection of severe sepsis. For patients determined to have a high risk of severe sepsis, the&#xD;
      algorithm will generate automated voice, telephone notification to nursing staff at CRMC, OH,&#xD;
      and UCSF. The algorithm's performance will be measured by analysis of the primary endpoint,&#xD;
      in-hospital SIRS-based mortality. The secondary endpoints will be in-hospital severe&#xD;
      sepsis/shock-coded mortality, SIRS-based hospital length of stay, and severe&#xD;
      sepsis/shock-coded hospital length of stay.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      From July 2020 to February 2021, inclusive, we will perform a randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      (RCT) across eight subpopulations at CRMC, OH, and UCSF. The subpopulations which will be&#xD;
      included in the trial are: Cardiology, Gastroenterology (GI), Intensive Care Unit (ICU),&#xD;
      Medicine, Oncology, Surgery, Transplant, and Emergency Department (ED). All aims of this&#xD;
      study across both phases including the RCT have been approved by the Pearl Institutional&#xD;
      Review Board with a waiver of informed consent (IRB00007772, FWA00026887).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study period, all patients over the age of 18 presenting to the emergency&#xD;
      department or admitted to an inpatient unit at the participating facilities will&#xD;
      automatically be enrolled in the trial if they are a member of one of the eight&#xD;
      subpopulations of interest in this study, until the target enrollment for the study is met.&#xD;
      Enrollment will entail randomization to either the control or the experimental arms. Patients&#xD;
      will be assigned to the experimental group or control group based on a random allocation&#xD;
      sequence, generated by a computer program before the start of the trial, using simple&#xD;
      randomization, with a 1:1 allocation ratio. This allocation sequence will be concealed to&#xD;
      patients, healthcare providers and study investigators. However the trial will have an&#xD;
      open-label design, as full blinding is not possible as some group assignments will become&#xD;
      naturally revealed upon receipt of telephonic alerts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two arms in the study. The control arm will involve patients monitored by the&#xD;
      original version of InSight, and the experimental arm will involve patients monitored by the&#xD;
      subpopulation-customized version of InSight. In both arms, if the applicable algorithm&#xD;
      determines a patient to be at high risk for severe sepsis, a telephonic alert will be sent to&#xD;
      the charge nurse on duty in the patient's current location. Response to alerts will follow&#xD;
      the protocol from our previous sepsis clinical trial. The procedure consists of a nurse&#xD;
      conducting a patient bedside evaluation to rule out suspected infection. This includes&#xD;
      assessment of patient vital signs, EHR notes, and recent laboratory results. If the nurse&#xD;
      suspects severe sepsis, a physician subsequently assesses the patient and, if appropriate,&#xD;
      places an order for administration of the standard sepsis treatment bundle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the administration of clinical trials, some open-label studies are cluster-randomized&#xD;
      while others are randomized at an individual patient level. Cluster randomization is&#xD;
      frequently used to minimize &quot;contamination&quot; between treatment and control groups, because&#xD;
      exposure of providers to patients from both arms in an open-label study often invites&#xD;
      unintentional behavioral biases. These biases may cause providers to adjust their&#xD;
      interventions in the control group to mimic their actions in the experimental group, thereby&#xD;
      masking the intervention's effect and skewing the study results towards the null. Although&#xD;
      open-label, cluster-randomized trials are effective in minimizing contamination among groups,&#xD;
      they have several significant disadvantages, including greater complexity in design and&#xD;
      analysis as well as larger patient enrollment requirements to achieve the same statistical&#xD;
      power. Because larger sample sizes often necessitate increases in cost, length, or complexity&#xD;
      of a trial, current research has indicated that trialists should use individual randomization&#xD;
      if possible due to the drawbacks of cluster allocation. Given these considerations, we&#xD;
      concluded that individual randomization was the best strategy for our trial, as it affords a&#xD;
      significant amount of increase in statistical power and allows each patient outcome to be&#xD;
      assessed independently of every other patient. To minimize possible bias, we also decided to&#xD;
      make the automated phone call text identical in both arms. The successful use of&#xD;
      patient-level randomization in our previous sepsis clinical trial gives us confidence in this&#xD;
      trial design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the discharge of the last enrolled patient, we will evaluate whether the primary&#xD;
      endpoint of in-hospital SIRS-based mortality and secondary endpoints of in-hospital severe&#xD;
      sepsis/shock-coded mortality, SIRS-based hospital length of stay, and severe&#xD;
      sepsis/shock-coded hospital length of stay are met. Additional outcome measures of interest&#xD;
      for each SIRS-based and severe sepsis/shock-coded patient groups will include: time to&#xD;
      completion of each element of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) bundle; ventilator-free&#xD;
      days; ICU days; and 30-day hospital readmission rate. The 1-hour SSC bundle consists of&#xD;
      obtaining blood cultures, measuring lactate level, administering broad-spectrum antibiotics,&#xD;
      administering 30 mL/kg of crystalloid fluid for hypertension or lactate &gt;4 mmol/L, and&#xD;
      applying vasopressors if patient is hypotensive during or after fluid resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be considered &quot;SIRS-based&quot; and included for primary endpoint analysis if they&#xD;
      meet two or more SIRS criteria at any point during their stay. The reason for this inclusion&#xD;
      criteria is that the algorithm may detect severe sepsis before it is apparent in the chart,&#xD;
      and therefore sepsis may be resolved with early intervention prior to severe sepsis&#xD;
      documentation in the medical record. For example, if a CDS alert results in treatment&#xD;
      initiation before organ dysfunction indicative labs are drawn, the patient's state of &quot;severe&#xD;
      sepsis&quot; may be censored out. Limiting inclusion criteria to the 2001 consensus (Sepsis-2)&#xD;
      severe sepsis definition criteria or the Sepsis-3 criteria would exclude such patients from&#xD;
      analysis; however, such censorship will be avoided with our use of SIRS-based inclusion&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to draw from EHR-based clinical data for primary endpoint analysis, as opposed to&#xD;
      claims-based data, due to its ability to provide more objective measurements on patient&#xD;
      outcomes. However, to compare to other studies that use coding-based inclusion, claims data&#xD;
      will be used in inclusion criteria for secondary endpoints. Patients will be considered to be&#xD;
      documented &quot;severe sepsis/septic shock-coded&quot; and included for secondary endpoint analysis if&#xD;
      they meet either Angus implementation criteria or any of the following diagnosis codes: R6520&#xD;
      and/or R6521 with septicemia codes A400, A401, A403, A408, A4101, A4102, A411, A412, A413,&#xD;
      A414, A4150, A4151, A4152, A4153, A4159, A4181, A4189, A427, A021, A227, A267, A327, A5486,&#xD;
      B377. The use of explicit ICD codes alone for tracking sepsis is known to have high&#xD;
      specificity but low sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of the study, significant findings will be published as scientific papers.&#xD;
