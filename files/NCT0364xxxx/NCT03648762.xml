    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to better understand how skeletal muscle is affected by&#xD;
      heart failure, and to determine how exercise interventions impact skeletal muscle and&#xD;
      functional capacity. While many think of heart failure as a disease that only affects the&#xD;
      heart, doctors now believe that it actually affects the whole body, including skeletal&#xD;
      muscle, such as the muscles of your arms and legs. Therefore, while many people with heart&#xD;
      failure develop weakness and reduced exercise capacity, this may be related more to their&#xD;
      skeletal muscle than their weakened hearts. This study looks directly at how exercise might&#xD;
      change skeletal muscle and possibly improve quality of life in heart failure patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the study participants will take part in a cardiopulmonary exercise test, lower&#xD;
      body strength testing, breathing assessment, a muscle biopsy (optional), blood draw, and DXA&#xD;
      scanning (to assess lean body mass). Participants with heart failure will complete 1 of 3&#xD;
      exercise training interventions (aerobic vs. aerobic and strength vs. inspiratory) for 12&#xD;
      weeks and will be assessed pre and post to determine if any differences occur in their&#xD;
      skeletal muscle and functional capacity as part of the exercise intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite decades of research, heart failure (HF) remains a common disease that continues to&#xD;
      rise in prevalence, particularly among an expanding senior population. By virtue of age,&#xD;
      older adults are prone to higher incidence of HF and worse clinical consequences. Exercise&#xD;
      intolerance and dyspnea are common symptoms that portend poor prognosis and which also&#xD;
      insidiously detract from functional independence and quality of life. Mortality and morbidity&#xD;
      also increase significantly as functional capacity declines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Growing evidence suggests that pathophysiology of central cardiac dysfunction is associated&#xD;
      with peripheral pathophysiology (particularly skeletal muscle and vascular perfusion&#xD;
      abnormalities) such that symptoms, exercise intolerance, and poor clinical outcomes&#xD;
      correspond to a complex aggregate pathophysiological process. While HF therapeutic guidelines&#xD;
      primarily emphasize steps that improve cardiac parameters, and/or volume status, goals to&#xD;
      modify what some describe as &quot;HF skeletal muscle myopathy&quot; may constitute a vital&#xD;
      complementary treatment target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ongoing analyses from our pilot VA Merit investigation provide pertinent insights and&#xD;
      substantiation. The investigators demonstrated reduced functional capacity (both aerobic and&#xD;
      strength) in 31 HF patients (mean age 66) compared to 39 age-matched healthy controls (mean&#xD;
      age 67). The investigators also showed increased expression of genes signaling&#xD;
      ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis in skeletal muscle in relation to decreasing aerobic and&#xD;
      strength performance. Consistently, reduced lean muscle mass, as measured by Dual Energy&#xD;
      X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scanning, correlated to the reduced strength indices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal constitutes a logical progression of this pilot analysis, and follows the&#xD;
      analytic path the investigators anticipated 3 years ago. The pilot (cross-sectional) study&#xD;
      enabled us to characterize key skeletal muscle gene expression patterns in association to&#xD;
      disease, exercise capacity, and body composition. The investigators now propose an exercise&#xD;
      intervention trial to compare the effects of 3 regimens (i.e., aerobic vs. aerobic and&#xD;
      strength vs. inspiratory) each with a unique physiological rationale. The investigators will&#xD;
      explore differences in how each modifies clinical attributes (function/symptoms) as well as&#xD;
      peripheral mechanisms of disease that likely underlie these differences, i.e., skeletal&#xD;
      muscle biology (histology, gene expression) and effects of body composition. These insights&#xD;
      will help identify therapeutic strategies that better suppress injurious disease mechanisms&#xD;
      and thereby facilitate improved clinical outcomes and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to study 100 total male and female HF patients aged 50 years. At&#xD;
      the outset, a comprehensive battery of function and symptoms will be assessed (aerobic,&#xD;
      strength, and integrated performance indices/questionnaires) as well as pertinent peripheral&#xD;
      components that include skeletal muscle (histology, gene expression); and body composition&#xD;
      (DXA); serum measurements of inflammation, cytokines, and adipokines. Subjects will then be&#xD;
      randomized into one of 3 training regimens. After 12 weeks of thrice weekly 60 minute&#xD;
      sessions, all subjects will be reassessed using the same clinical and mechanistic assessments&#xD;
      to ascertain differences. Confounding effects of body habitus, age, medications, sleep, and&#xD;
      nutrition will also be assessed and controlled for.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess differences in functional outcomes (peak VO2, 1RM) relative to the training&#xD;
           therapy. a. Aerobic vs. Aerobic-Strength regimens will be compared to one another. The&#xD;
           investigators hypothesize that Aerobic-Strength will be superior to Aerobic alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Inspiratory Training will be compared to Aerobic-Strength. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
           that Inspiratory Training will match the effects of traditional Aerobic-Strength&#xD;
           training as it imparts similar aerobic and strengthening physiology in orientation to&#xD;
           the diaphragm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary analyses will include assessments of training differences in respect to broader&#xD;
      functional parameters (aerobic, strength, inspiration), symptoms, and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. To assess gene expression in relation to the different training regimens. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that proteolytic genes (including Foxo and Ubiquitin) will be&#xD;
      over-expressed in relation to diminished function and that genes that counteract skeletal&#xD;
      muscle proteolysis (IGF-1, PGC-1 ) will increase in relation to functional gains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that exercise modes with direct skeletal muscle stimulus&#xD;
      (strength training) will induce greater changes in gene expression (diminished proteolytic&#xD;
      and increased anabolic genes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that exercise modes that stimulate central cardiac performance&#xD;
      and vascular relaxation (aerobic and inspiratory training) will induce greater changes in&#xD;
      skeletal muscle perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary analyses will include assessment of the relative impact of skeletal gene expression&#xD;
      vs. perfusion dynamics on function, symptoms, and quality of life. Consequences of serum&#xD;
      inflammation, cytokines, adipokines, and effects of muscle histology will be factored in&#xD;
      these analyses.&#xD;
