    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is: (1) to evaluate the short-term effects of a 10-week residential&#xD;
      stay in a Danish Christmas Seal Home on health, physical fitness, physical activity level,&#xD;
      learning, sleep and well-being; (2) to investigate the long-term effects 3 and 12 months&#xD;
      after the stay; and (3) to examine whether a special effort involving a high-intensity&#xD;
      activity/health education programme (FIFA 11 for Health) increases the effects on physical&#xD;
      fitness and health knowledge, learning capabilities, sleep patterns, well-being and adherence&#xD;
      to a physically active lifestyle compared to the standard programme.&#xD;

      Design Approx. 600 boys and girls aged 7-14 years are recruited from two Danish Cristmas Seal&#xD;
      Homes (DCSHs) during 2018-2020. The design is a cross-over design at DCSH level over a&#xD;
      two-year period with two intervention groups: a standard group (with the standard programme&#xD;
      (SG)) and a standard + FIFA group (SG+). In SG+, the children, in addition to the standard&#xD;
      programme, play recreational football for 2x45 min a week. In SG, the children perform the&#xD;
      activities according to the regular schedule. In SG+, consist of different football exercises&#xD;
      (dribbling, ball control, passing, etc.) and small-sided games with high intensity (3v3 to&#xD;
      5v5) using two goals. Every week, a specific football skill is linked to a health message,&#xD;
      e.g. the skill of passing the ball to one another is linked to mutual respect and avoiding&#xD;
      bullying.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training protocol Recreational football The risk of injury for young players is markedly&#xD;
      higher (5 times higher) in football match-play than in football training. While it is noted&#xD;
      that muscle strains and twisting injuries in joints can also occur during training with small&#xD;
      goals, the injury frequency for 10-year-old children in football training is approx. 5 per&#xD;
      1,000 training sessions, and hence low. Furthermore, the FIFA 11 for Health pilot study,&#xD;
      which involved Danish 10-11-year-old schoolchildren, did not record any injuries during the&#xD;
      training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests and measurements The participants are tested at the start and end of their 10-week&#xD;
      residential stay at the DCSH. Furthermore, there are follow-up tests 3 and 12 months after&#xD;
      their stay. The four test days include measurements of physical fitness, physical&#xD;
      performance, cognitive functions and questionnaires about health knowledge, well-being and&#xD;
      sleep patterns. For further descriptions, see below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each test day, lasting approx. 4-5 hours, is planned in collaboration with DCSH staff and&#xD;
      implemented by a member of the scientific group (human physiologists).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric measurements: Body weight and standing and sitting height are measured using a&#xD;
      portable body composition analyser (InBody 720) and an altimeter, respectively. The InBody&#xD;
      720 also provides an estimate of muscle mass and fat percentage. After a minimum of 10 min of&#xD;
      resting in the supine position in a quiet room, measurements of resting heart rate and blood&#xD;
      pressure are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Balance and muscle strength/horizontal jumping performance: Balance performance is measured&#xD;
      using the Stork test. It is measured on both legs, with the best of three attempts counting&#xD;
      as the result. The child stands on the floor barefoot or in socks, eyes open with their&#xD;
      weight on the entire sole of the supporting foot, arms on hips and the non-weight-bearing&#xD;
      foot placed on the inside of the opposite knee. When the child has got their balance, the&#xD;
      heel of the supporting foot is lifted and the time starts. The time stops for the following&#xD;
      reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hands/arms leave the hips.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Supporting foot moves.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heel touches the floor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Foot resting on the knee is removed from the knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explosive leg strength: Measured by a standing longitudinal jump. The starting position is&#xD;
      with hands on hips and bent knees. The participants start the jump from behind a line on the&#xD;
      floor with a two-footed take-off and land on their feet on a thin mat. The distance from the&#xD;
      take-off to the point where the rear heel contacts the mat is noted and the best of two&#xD;
      attempts counts. Standing longitudinal jumping is correlated with both upper- and lower-body&#xD;
      strength tests in children and adolescents, and can therefore be considered as a general&#xD;
      index for muscular fitness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aerobic fitness and intermittent performance: The original Andersen interval running test is&#xD;
      used for indirect estimation of maximal oxygen uptake. The participants run back and forth&#xD;
      between cones in a 20-m lane, touching the line between the cones at each end. After 15 s,&#xD;
      the participant stops as quickly as possible (about two steps) and rests for 15 s. This&#xD;
      procedure is followed for a total of 10 min. The 15-s periods are indicated by music, which&#xD;
      stops during rest periods. All participants start and finish the test at the same time. The&#xD;
      distance covered is recorded as the test result. This test has previously been performed in&#xD;
      6-13-year-olds, and no risks or adverse effects have been observed. The test is also&#xD;
      validated for children in the age group 6-13 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive functions: During the four test rounds, the participants are tested using a&#xD;
      computer-based objective cognitive test battery that has been validated and verified in the&#xD;
      age group 10-18 years for measuring children's cognitive functions. The battery consists of&#xD;
      four tests measuring reaction time, attention, visual learning and long-term memory, work&#xD;
      memory and executive functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic markers: Saliva collected using a Salivette tube is used to indicate the level of&#xD;
      hormone insulin. The insulin level may indicate an increased risk of insulin resistance and&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes. Saliva samples are kept as cold as possible until they can be centrifuged.&#xD;
      Samples are centrifuged and the supernatant stripped into cryo tubes and stored at -20&#xD;
      degrees, then -80 degrees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hair samples are taken for determination of long-term exposure to the biomarker cortisol.&#xD;
      These consist of approx. 100 hairs cut as close to the scalp as possible. They are kept in an&#xD;
      envelope until analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health knowledge and general and sports psychology measurements Questionnaires are used at&#xD;
      baseline, at the end of the DCSH stay, and 3 and 12 months after the stay to examine the&#xD;
      participants' health, well-being/mental health, ego and task orientation, cohesion, stress&#xD;
      levels and sleep habits. During completion of the questionnaires, a supervisor is present to&#xD;
      assist with any problems with reading and understanding. The participant's health knowledge&#xD;
      is measured using a questionnaire that examines their learning and understanding of the 11&#xD;
      health messages. There is a total of 38 questions. The purpose of the questionnaire is to&#xD;
      investigate how much the participant has learned about each of the 11 health messages in the&#xD;
      programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant's well-being/mental health is measured using a PedsQL questionnaire as well&#xD;
      as a Kids Screen questionnaire. The questionnaires, comprising 22 and 25 questions,&#xD;
      respectively, aim to measure the well-being of the participant and cover a wide range of&#xD;
      dimensions in well-being. A previous survey has tested the validity of the questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant's ego and task orientation is measured using the Task and Ego Orientation in&#xD;
      Sport Questionnaire (TEOSQ). The questionnaire comprises 13 questions (7 for task and 6 for&#xD;
      ego orientation) that are answered on a Likert scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is &quot;strongly&#xD;
      disagree&quot; and 5 is &quot;strongly agree&quot;. Task-oriented participants emphasise doing their best,&#xD;
      experiencing progress and/or improving their skills, while ego-oriented participants measure&#xD;
      themselves against others and emphasise being successful and better than others. The&#xD;
      questionnaire has been validated and translated into Danish. TEOSQ has been used in Danish&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant's cohesion is measured using the Youth Sport Environment Questionnaire&#xD;
      (YSEQ). The questionnaire comprises 12 questions that are answered on a Likert scale of 1 to&#xD;
      5, where 1 is &quot;does not fit&quot; and 5 is &quot;fits completely&quot;. Cohesion describes how the&#xD;
      participant perceives the class's solidarity regarding social aspects and its ability to&#xD;
      solve tasks in unity. The questionnaire has been validated in English and the Danish version&#xD;
      has been used in similar studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) is used to assess the participant's sleep&#xD;
      habits. The questionnaire is available in several versions comprising 33 or 26 questions for&#xD;
      completion by the parents and the child, respectively. The questions are answered &quot;usually&quot;&#xD;
      (5 to 7 times a week), &quot;sometimes&quot; (2 to 4 times a week) or &quot;rarely&quot; (0 to 1 time a week).&#xD;
      The questionnaires clarify sleep habits, sleep disorders and consequences of disturbed sleep.&#xD;
      The questionnaires have been validated in English, and the parents' version has been used in&#xD;
      studies in Danish. The children's version will be used at baseline, at the end of the 10-week&#xD;
      DCSH residential stay, and both 3 and 12 months after the stay, while the parents' version&#xD;
      will be used at baseline and 3 and 12 months after the stay. The children's version is in&#xD;
      English. Before the start of the study, the version will undergo a process of translation&#xD;
      into Danish, back-translation into English and pre-testing with 5-10 children, and can thus&#xD;
      be used as a self-reporting version.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant's stress levels are measured using the Strengths and Difficulties&#xD;
      Questionnaire (SDQ). The self-completion version for the children has been validated in&#xD;
      English. The questionnaire comprises 30 questions answered with &quot;fails&quot;, &quot;fits partially&quot; or&#xD;
      &quot;fits well&quot; within the last 6 months (baseline - afterwards, within the last month). The&#xD;
      children's version will be used at baseline, after the DCSH stay, as well as both 3 and 12&#xD;
      months after the stay. The questionnaire reveals symptoms of emotional, behavioural,&#xD;
      hyperactivity/concentration and social challenges. The parents' version has previously been&#xD;
      used in studies with Danish youth (5-12 years). The parents' version will be used at baseline&#xD;
      and 3 and 12 months after the stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the above test days, the following measurements are performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous intensity measurements during training&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity recordings are carried out frequently during the training intervention. Measurements&#xD;
      are performed up to four times for approx. 50 participants from each DCSH, including pulse&#xD;
      rate measurements (Polar Team 2), GPS measurements and accelerometer measurements to&#xD;
      determine intensity and motion pattern analysis. At the training sessions where activity&#xD;
      recordings are carried out, short questionnaires are also provided to measure perceived&#xD;
      exertion and flow in relation to the training. In relation to accelerometer measurements,&#xD;
      participants' daily activity level and sleep patterns are also recorded for up to 25% of&#xD;
      participants during the intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional information Socioeconomic data, ethnicity and background details and health data&#xD;
      are obtained via a parent-completed questionnaire. Absence lists, as well as results from&#xD;
      school-related tests, are also obtained through the DCSH to exploit the large number of&#xD;
      participants in various subgroup analyses.&#xD;
