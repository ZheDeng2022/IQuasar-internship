  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel&#xD;
      group, double-blind, superiority trial of vasopressin and methylprednisolone during adult&#xD;
      in-hospital cardiac arrest. There will be ten enrolling sites in Denmark. 492 adult patients&#xD;
      with in-hospital cardiac arrest receiving at least one dose of adrenaline will be enrolled.&#xD;
      The primary outcome is return of spontaneous circulation and key secondary outcomes include&#xD;
      survival at 30 days and survival at 30 days with a favorable neurological outcome.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Return of spontaneous circulation</measure>
    <time_frame>During the cardiac arrest</time_frame>
    <description>Return of spontaneous circulation will be defined as spontaneous circulation with no further need for chest compressions sustained for at least 20 minutes</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>At 30 days</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Favorable neurological outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>At 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>A favorable neurological outcome will be defined as a cerebral performance category score of 1 or 2. The cerebral performance category score is a 5-point scale assessing neurological/functional outcomes after brain damage with higher scores indicating worse neurological/functional outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Vasopressor-free days</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Vasopressor-free days will be defined as the number of days within the first 7 days after the cardiac arrest where the patient is not receiving vasopressors and is alive.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Invasive ventilation-free days</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Invasive ventilation-free days will be defined as the number of days within the first 7 days after the cardiac arrest where the patient is not receiving invasive ventilation and is alive.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score at 24, 48 and 72 hours</measure>
    <time_frame>24, 48 and 72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The SOFA score is a validated and widely used measure of organ failure assessing the respiratory, nervous, cardiovascular, hepatic, coagulation, and renal systems. We will assess both the cardiovascular sub score as well as the overall SOFA score.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital disposition</measure>
    <time_frame>At hospital discharge, up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Hospital disposition (e.g. home, rehabilitation, nursing home, hospice) will be defined at the time of discharge from the initial acute care hospital.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>At 90 days, 180 days, and 1 year</time_frame>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Favorable neurological outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>At 90 days, 180 days, and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>A favorable neurological outcome will be defined as a cerebral performance category score of 1 or 2. The cerebral performance category score is a 5-point scale assessing neurological/functional outcomes after brain damage with higher scores indicating worse neurological/functional outcomes.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Rankin scale (mRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 30 days, 90 days, 180 days, and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The mRS is a 7-point scale, ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (dead), assessing the degree of disability and dependence after a neurological injury such as stroke or cardiac arrest. A good outcome will be defined as a mRS of 0 to 3 and a poor outcome as 4 to 6.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 30 days, 90 days, 180 days, and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The GOSE is a 8-point scale that is an extension of the Glasgow Outcomes Scale (which is identical to the CPC, only with inverse scores) where the scores 1, 2 and 3 from the CPC score is divided into two.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 30 days, 90 days, 180 days, and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a well-established measure of health-related quality of life that is quantified as a utility (i.e. a measure of quality of life between 0 and 1).</description>

    <ipd_description>Six months after the publication of the last results, all de-identified individual patient data will be made available for data sharing. Procedures, including re-coding of key variables, will be put in place to allow for complete de-identification of the data. Data will be completely anonymized according to Danish law.&#xD;
All relevant trial-related documents, including the protocol, data dictionary, and the main statistical code, will be shared along with the data. There will be no predetermined end date for the data sharing.</ipd_description>
