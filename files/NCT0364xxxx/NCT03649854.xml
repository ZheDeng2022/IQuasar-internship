      The aim of this study is to measure TAPSE in TEE using two deep transgastric views. This is a&#xD;
      prospective comparative diagnostic study where 21 CABG patients who are enrolled for the&#xD;
      study will be studied during the intraoperative period. The choice of general anaesthesia,&#xD;
      hemodynamic management will be at the discretion of the anaesthesiologist in charge of the&#xD;
      patient. The monitoring technique is standard as per any cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      bypass. After induction of anaesthesia, TEE probe will be inserted by the PI or the&#xD;
      Co-Investigator and the required TEE standard views and deep TG view of the right heart at&#xD;
      zero degree and Deep TG view at 100-150 degrees will be acquired TAPSE will be measured in&#xD;
      both the views using Mmode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurement will be done as follows: After acquiring the deep TG views the M mode cursor&#xD;
      is aligned with the longitudinal motion the lateral tricuspid annulus. Once the Mmode picks&#xD;
      up a good signal, 3 cycles are chosen and measured using calipers, and an average reading is&#xD;
      taken. TAPSE will be used to evaluate the right heart function during the intraoperative&#xD;
      period so that the patients with deteriorating right heart function can be identified and&#xD;
      treatment started early. The potential benefits include the simplicity and reproducibility of&#xD;
      the technique.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Right ventricular failure(RVF) is an important cause of postoperative morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      after cardiac surgery. Severe refractory RVF requiring prolonged inotropic support or RV&#xD;
      assist device occurs in approximately 0.1% of patients after cardiotomy and in 20-30% of&#xD;
      patients after left ventricular failure. The survival rate in these patients may be as low as&#xD;
      25 to 30%. Early diagnosis and prompt instituition of therapy may improve survival. In the&#xD;
      intraoperative setting TEE is becoming the mainstay in the assessment of right ventricular&#xD;
      function. However, presently it is not systematic and objective assessment of RV is not&#xD;
      uniformly carried out. This is partly due to the enormous attention given to the evaluation&#xD;
      of the left ventricle and the echo challenges of right heart imaging during intraoperative&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2010 the ASE released the guidelines on Right heart. It recommends Fractional Area change,&#xD;
      Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion(TAPSE) and Peak Systolic tissue velocity of&#xD;
      tricuspid annulus as simple reproducible measurements that can be done in all the patients.&#xD;
      The guidelines are based on Transthoracic Echocardiography measurements. The Transesophageal&#xD;
      echocardiography which is used during cardiac surgery poses unique challenges when assessing&#xD;
      the right heart. The right ventricle lies in the far field where the resolution is not good,&#xD;
      and is made worse by the extensive apical trabeculations ; these factors make endocardial&#xD;
      border tracing difficult. In addition, the tissue Doppler and M mode alignment of the&#xD;
      tricuspid annulus is not possible in the mid oesophageal views. Recently, a deep trans&#xD;
      gastric view more than 120-150 degrees has been suggested by Denault et al which would give&#xD;
      an alignment for tissue and pulse wave Doppler but TAPSE hasn't been studied using this view.&#xD;
      The investigators have found a novel Deep trans gastric right heart view at zero degrees ,&#xD;
      which provides a good alignment for Doppler and M mode from which TAPSE, Peak systolic tissue&#xD;
      velocity of the Tricuspid annulus, and Right ventricular performance index can be readily&#xD;
      measured. We believe that this single view which can be easily acquired in most patients can&#xD;
      comprehensively assess the systolic and diastolic function of the right heart during the&#xD;
      intraoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose that TAPSE can be accurately measured using M mode in the deep&#xD;
      transgastric right heart view at zero degrees because it provides perfect alignment with&#xD;
      longitudinal excursion of the lateral tricuspid annulus. Since the frame rate of M mode is&#xD;
      very high, distance can be more accurately measured than any other technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare TAPSE measurement using Mmode in the two Deep&#xD;
      transgastric views: Deep TG view at 120- 150 degrees&#xD;
