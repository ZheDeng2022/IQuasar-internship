  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common consequence of combat that can result in&#xD;
      trauma-related hyperarousal and sleep disturbances. Poor sleep, one of the most common&#xD;
      complaints in Veterans with PTSD, can be distressing, impair concentration and memory, and&#xD;
      contribute to physical health conditions, such as metabolic syndrome, inflammation, and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. The orexin neuropeptide system underlies both sleep and stress&#xD;
      reactivity. Suvorexant, a drug that reduces orexin, improves sleep in civilians, but has not&#xD;
      yet been tested in Veterans with PTSD. This study will test whether suvorexant can improve&#xD;
      sleep disturbances and PTSD symptoms in Veterans. Suvorexant may benefit Veterans by&#xD;
      improving sleep quickly while also reducing PTSD symptoms over the long term, and with fewer&#xD;
      side effects that were common in previous medications used to treat these conditions.&#xD;
      Improving Veterans' sleep and PTSD symptoms could lead to better emotional and physical&#xD;
      well-being, quality of life, relationships, and functioning.&#xD;

      The investigators propose a two-site parallel group, randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled Phase IV clinical trial to test the efficacy and safety of suvorexant on&#xD;
      trauma-related sleep disturbance and PTSD symptoms in Veterans. The investigators will use a&#xD;
      flexible dose design of suvorexant with a 2-week titration followed by a 10-week steady-dose&#xD;
      phase. The investigators predict that suvorexant, as compared to placebo, will result in a&#xD;
      greater decrease in insomnia on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) over the 12-week trial. The&#xD;
      investigators also predict that suvorexant, as compared to placebo, will result in a greater&#xD;
      reduction in non-sleep PTSD symptoms in the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for Diagnostic&#xD;
      and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSMV) (CAPS-5) over the 12-week&#xD;
      trial. Secondarily, the investigators will examine potential objectively measured wrist&#xD;
      actigraphy as a biological mechanism of clinical improvement with as well as concomitant&#xD;
      effects on PTSD-related nightmares using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index-PTSD addendum&#xD;
      (PSQI-A). Pending a significant effect of suvorexant on PTSD, the investigators will perform&#xD;
      exploratory analyses to evaluate whether sleep improvement mediates the effect of suvorexant&#xD;
      on PTSD symptoms. The investigators will also examine safety and tolerability of suvorexant&#xD;
      compared to placebo (including depression, mood, vigor, suicidality, and daytime somnolence,&#xD;
      psychomotor vigilance, and functional disability). Results from this study will provide&#xD;
      substantive rationale for the use of Suvorexant in the treatment of Veterans with these&#xD;
      concerns. This study will be the first to examine a selective orexin-receptor antagonist in a&#xD;
      Veteran sample with PTSD. Suvorexant is an accessible, non-stigmatized medication whose use&#xD;
      and safety has been well-established in non-mental-health settings. It has outstanding&#xD;
      promise for treating common and distressing symptoms in Veterans as well as civilians with&#xD;
      trauma-related sleep disturbance and PTSD.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The ISI is a specific index of perceived insomnia severity. Areas assessed include problems with sleep onset, sleep maintenance, and early morning awakening; dissatisfaction with sleep; interference with daily functioning; impact on quality of life; and worry about sleep problems.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The CAPS-5 is a 30-item interview that is the gold standard assessment for PTSD. The CAPS-5 provides a dimensional and categorical measure of PTSD, and incorporates frequency and intensity of symptoms into a single severity score. The CAPS-5 will determine a threshold for PTSD severity (past week) at baseline (excluding change in item #20 falling and staying asleep). Possible scores range from 0 to 80. All trained and certified CAPS-raters will function independently and will not be involved in recruitment, study coordination, or evaluation of side effects.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Wrist Actigraphy</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from 1 week at baseline, and weeks 4, 8, and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep wake schedule will be monitored with wrist actigraphy (Micro Motionlogger, Ambulatory Monitoring, Inc.). The actigraph provides continuous activity data using a battery-operated wristwatch-size microprocessor that senses motion with a three axis accelerometer. High-resolution data will be down-sampled to one-minute sample intervals for conventional actigraphic sleep-wake estimation and analyzed using ActionW-2 (Ambulatory Monitoring, Inc.) software. Sleep efficiency, sleep maintenance, total sleep time and wake after sleep onset will be used as secondary measures of sleep.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index-PTSD Addendum (PSQI-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in PTSD-related nightmares across the 12 week trial</time_frame>
    <description>PSQI-A will be used to assess disruptive nocturnal behaviors related to PTSD, including nightmares, hot flashes and episodes of terror during sleep. Scores ranges from 0 (normal) to 21 (severe). The investigators plan to evaluate nightmares as a secondary outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression (CGI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change across the 12 week trial</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinician and patient reports of improvement on the CGI (depression, mood, vigor, suicidality, daytime somnolence, and functional disability rating scales.) The CGI measures psychiatric treatment response by evaluating global severity of illness and change in the clinical condition over time. It consists of 3 global subscales: Severity of Illness, Global Improvement, and Efficacy Index. Item 1 is rated on a seven-point scale (1=normal to 7=extremely ill); item 2 on a seven-point scale (1=very much improved to 7=very much worse); and item 3 on a four-point scale (from 'none' to 'outweighs therapeutic effect'). The CGI will be used as a secondary measure of remission (i.e., CGI-I of 1 &quot;very much improved&quot; or 2 &quot;much improved&quot;).</description>
