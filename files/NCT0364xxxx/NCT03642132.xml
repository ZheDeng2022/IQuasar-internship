    <textblock>
      JAVELIN Ovarian PARP 100 (B9991030) is an open-label, randomized study designed to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of avelumab in combination with chemotherapy followed by maintenance&#xD;
      therapy of avelumab in combination with talazoparib versus an active comparator in&#xD;
      treatment-naïve patients with locally advanced or metastatic ovarian cancer (Stage III or&#xD;
      Stage IV). On March 19, 2019, Sponsors alliance announced the discontinuation of the ongoing&#xD;
      Phase III study, and the decision was based on several factors, including previous announced&#xD;
      interim results from JAVELIN Ovarian 100 study (B9991010). Patients who remain in B9991030&#xD;
      study will continue receiving their randomized treatment assigned and will be monitored for&#xD;
      appropriate safety assessments until treatment discontinuation.&#xD;

      JAVELIN Ovarian PARP 100 (B9991030) is an open-label, international, multi-center, randomized&#xD;
      study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of avelumab in combination with&#xD;
      chemotherapy followed by maintenance therapy of avelumab in combination with talazoparib&#xD;
      versus an active comparator in treatment-naïve patients with locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      ovarian cancer (Stage III or Stage IV). The primary endpoint is progression-free survival&#xD;
      (PFS) as determined based on blinded independent central review (BICR) assessment per RECIST&#xD;
      v1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On March 19, 2019, Sponsors alliance announced the discontinuation of the ongoing Phase III&#xD;
      JAVELIN Ovarian PARP 100 study. The alliance has notified health authorities and trial&#xD;
      investigators of the decision to discontinue the trial. The decision was based on several&#xD;
      emerging factors since the trial's initiation, including the previously announced interim&#xD;
      results from JAVELIN Ovarian 100 study (B9991010), which was stopped due to futility of&#xD;
      efficacy at a planned interim analysis on 21 December 2018. The alliance determined that the&#xD;
      degree of benefit observed with avelumab in frontline ovarian cancer in that study does not&#xD;
      support continuation of the JAVELIN Ovarian PARP 100 trial in an unselected patient&#xD;
      population and emphasizes the need to better understand the role of immunotherapy in ovarian&#xD;
      cancer. Additional factors include the rapidly changing treatment landscape and the approval&#xD;
      of a PARP inhibitor in the frontline maintenance setting. The decision to discontinue the&#xD;
      JAVELIN Ovarian PARP 100 trial was not made for safety reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who remain in the study will continue receiving investigational products according&#xD;
      to their randomized treatment assignment and will be monitored for appropriate safety&#xD;
      assessments until treatment discontinuation.&#xD;
