      Eccrine porocarcinoma (EPC) is a slow-growing carcinoma arising from the eccrine sweat&#xD;
      glands. Based on its clinical presentation it can be confused with malignant and benign skin&#xD;
      lesions, both. Histological examination is essential to formulate a correct diagnosis.&#xD;
      Surgical excision with clear margins is the standard therapeutic approach while the role of&#xD;
      sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNLB) remains controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Authors report two cases of EPC of the lower limbs occurred in two women. Patients were&#xD;
      treated by wide surgical excision of the lesion and SNLB.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Eccrine porocarcinoma (EPC), first described by Pinkus and Mehregan in 1963, is&#xD;
      a rare form of skin cancer. Its presentations very often mimics a cutaneous lesion similar to&#xD;
      other forms of benign and malignant cutaneous neoplasms. Accurate diagnosis, optimal&#xD;
      treatment and prognosis of EPC are still challenging due to scant literature reports. Eccrine&#xD;
      carcinomas may have an elevate presence of regional lymph node metastasis, thus some authors&#xD;
      have advocated SLNB for all or some patients, but its utility for staging purposes remains&#xD;
      unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We report two cases of EPC in which the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CASE PRESENTATION Case 1 During August 2017, a 64 years woman was seen at our department&#xD;
      after a previous cutaneous lesion excision with an histological diagnosis of porocarcinoma of&#xD;
      the left thigh. The histological examination revealed a poroid neoplasm extending into the&#xD;
      deep dermis to the level of the dermal-subcutaneous junction with a thickness of 5.4mm, 10-12&#xD;
      mitoses per 10 high-power field, absence of lymphovascular invasion and free margins with a&#xD;
      clearing distance of 1.5 mm. Hematoxilyn-eosin staining and Immunohistochemical (IHC)&#xD;
      analysis showed positive staining for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cytokeratin (CK) 5,7&#xD;
      and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      She had a past medical history of appendicitis in childhood, anxious-depressive syndrome,&#xD;
      osteoporosis, hiatal hernia, obesity and smoked about 20 cigarettes a day. New York Heart&#xD;
      Association (NYHA) score was 1 and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score was 1.&#xD;
      The patient had no anorexia and weight loss and the examination did not reveal any inguinal&#xD;
      lymphadenopathy. Laboratory tests, including blood count, biochemical investigations and&#xD;
      serological viral markers were normal. The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm and the&#xD;
      chest radiograph showed no signs of pleural or parenchymal lesions. After multidisciplinary&#xD;
      discussion and based on the sub-optimal clearing margin we performed a re-excision of the&#xD;
      previous wound to ensure wider safety margins of at least 20 mm similarly to surgical&#xD;
      strategy for other skin tumors and in particular melanoma. At that time it was also decided&#xD;
      to perform a SLNB; preoperative lymph-node scintigraphy showed the presence of two sentinel&#xD;
      lymph nodes in the left groin that were excised during SLNB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case 2 During August 2017, a 65year-old female was admitted to our department with&#xD;
      histological finding of EPC of the right leg. One month before, she underwent surgical&#xD;
      excision of a cutaneous lesion of the right leg. This lesion appeared brownish, exophytic,&#xD;
      with ulcerated surface, more suggestive for a squamous cell carcinoma than an ulcerated&#xD;
      nodular basal cell carcinoma. The histological examination revealed a poroid neoplasm&#xD;
      extending into the reticular dermis with a thickness of 5 mm, 10 mitoses per 10 high-power&#xD;
      field, absence of lymphovascular invasion and free margins with a clearing distance of 2 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      She had a past medical history of hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for&#xD;
      uterine fibromatosis, kidney transplantation for severe chronic renal failure, high blood&#xD;
      pressure, aneurysmal dilatation of the right common carotid artery, hypercholesterolemia,&#xD;
      hyperparathyroidism and previous inferior myocardial infarction. Laboratory tests, including&#xD;
      blood count, biochemical investigations and serum viral markers were normal. After&#xD;
      multidisciplinary discussion and based on the sub-optimal clearing margin we performed a&#xD;
      re-excision of the previous wound to ensure wider safety margins of at least 20 mm. It was&#xD;
      also decided to perform a SLNB; the pre-operative lymph node scintigraphy showed the presence&#xD;
      of two sentinel lymph nodes in the right inguinal site. The patient underwent enlargement of&#xD;
      the surgical excision until 20 mm of free margin from the previous excision and SLNB of the&#xD;
      two lymph nodes identified preoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DISCUSSION EPC is a rare neoplasm arising from the intra-epidermal ductal portion of the&#xD;
      eccrine sweat gland and represents approximately 0.005 % of all cases of malignant epithelial&#xD;
      neoplasms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elderly patients are the most affected, with a peak incidence between the 6th and7th decade&#xD;
      of life. Although it does not seem to have a predilection for sex or race, some studies&#xD;
      indicate a slight prevalence in women. The exact etiology of EPC is unclear. Some authors&#xD;
      suggested a possible association with radiation exposure and immunosuppression although an&#xD;
      excessive sun exposure does not seem to be a significant risk factor. EPC may arise de novo&#xD;
      or can develop from a pre-existing benign lesion; some clinical signs, such as spontaneous&#xD;
      bleeding, sudden growth and ulceration in a longstanding stable lesion must lead to the&#xD;
      suspicion of malignant degeneration. Clinically EPC can be presented as an erythematous or&#xD;
      violaceous nodule, papule or plaque with an infiltrative or erosive pattern. EPC usually&#xD;
      arises on the lower extremities (44%), followed by the trunk (24%), head &amp; neck (23%), upper&#xD;
      extremities (11%), and rarely involves other areas. Microscopically, EPC is characterized by&#xD;
      a cluster of anaplastic cells with nuclear hyperchromasia and important mitotic activity,&#xD;
      extending from the epidermis to the dermis, surrounded by ductal lumen. Robinson et al.&#xD;
      reported specific histopathologic features of EPC which may be predictive of a less favorable&#xD;
      outcome. Thickness is the main prognostic factors for EPC. Tumors greater than 7 mm in&#xD;
      thickness, an infiltrating front of tumor cells, the presence of lymphovascular invasion, and&#xD;
      greater than 14 mitoses per high-power field were noted to be associated with a poorer&#xD;
      prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The differential diagnosis includes basal and squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma,&#xD;
      amelanotic melanoma, Bowen's disease, Paget's disease and also benign lesions like fibroma&#xD;
      and pyogenic granuloma. Some immunohistochemical markers as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA),&#xD;
      EMA, and p53 protein may play a role in the diagnosis of EPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic options for the treatment of EPC include electrofulguration, electrocautery,&#xD;
      surgical excision, radiation and amputation. Surgical excision with histologically clear&#xD;
      margins is generally considered the treatment of choice with cure rates as high as 70-80 %,&#xD;
      although a recurrence rate of up to 20% has been reported. This elevate incidence of local&#xD;
      recurrence may be due to a not optimal free margin at surgical excision. Lymph node&#xD;
      metastases are present at diagnosis in 20% of cases and the incidence of visceral metastases&#xD;
      is reported to be 10%. The tumor tends to spread tangentially in the lower third of the&#xD;
      epidermis, then after infiltrates the dermis, subcuticular fat and lymphatic system. The role&#xD;
      of sentinel lymph node biopsy remains controversial.&#xD;
