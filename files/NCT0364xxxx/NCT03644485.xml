  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to confirm non-inferiority of delayed Prograf treatment to&#xD;
      standard Prograf treatment in the incidence of delayed graft function (DGF) within 1 week&#xD;
      between the 2 immunosuppressive (IS) treatment groups: delayed or standard Prograf together&#xD;
      with induction therapy, and then convert to Advagraf usage in donation after cardiac (or&#xD;
      circulatory) death (DCD) kidney transplant recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also compare the clinical outcome within 6 month post-transplant between the&#xD;
      2 IS treatment groups and compare the safety throughout study period between the 2 IS&#xD;
      treatment groups.&#xD;
