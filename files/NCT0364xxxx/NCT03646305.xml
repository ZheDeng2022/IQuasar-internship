      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Examine whether singing can be used as a cognitive defusion strategy to change one's&#xD;
           appraisals of body-related thoughts so they are less threatening to the individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Explore whether this technique can change the appraisals of one's body (i.e. increasing&#xD;
           body satisfaction, increasing body esteem, decreasing the drive towards thinness), as&#xD;
           well as increase mood and self-esteem.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compare singing to the defusion strategy of verbal repetition, as well as control&#xD;
           conditions, to determine the effectiveness of these techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Examine whether defusion techniques would be particularly beneficial for individuals&#xD;
           with high thought-shape fusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis was that the cognitive defusion conditions, namely verbal repetition&#xD;
      and singing, would foster greater detachment (i.e. defusion) from negative body-related&#xD;
      thoughts and change thought appraisals such that these thoughts were less believable and less&#xD;
      negative, and the individual was more willing, less likely to avoid, and less uncomfortable&#xD;
      when engaging with these thoughts than the control conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypotheses propose that these defusion techniques will reduce negative body-related&#xD;
      cognitions such as body image distress, drive for thinness, and body dissatisfaction to a&#xD;
      greater extent than the control conditions. Moreover, compared to the control condition,&#xD;
      these techniques are expected to be superior in reducing negative mood and improving&#xD;
      self-esteem. Finally, better outcomes are expected from those in the defusion conditions who&#xD;
      practice the technique as instructed (i.e. better homework adherence). Due to the novelty of&#xD;
      this intervention, no specific hypotheses have been made regarding whether singing will equal&#xD;
      or differ from verbal repetition on the aforementioned outcome measures. Moreover, due to the&#xD;
      exploratory nature of applying defusion techniques with individuals with thought-shape&#xD;
      fusion, no specific hypotheses have been made around anticipated changes in the perception of&#xD;
      the thought, body image satisfaction, mood, self-esteem, and cognitive defusion within this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eating disorders are characterized by intense mental preoccupation with body shape and&#xD;
      weight. Even in the absence of disordered eating, high levels of body dissatisfaction&#xD;
      prospectively predict depression and low self-esteem in young women. Common intervention&#xD;
      strategies, such as challenging the validity of negative body-related thoughts, often have&#xD;
      limited success. Recent research suggests that accepting, rather than challenging, negative&#xD;
      body-related thoughts may reduce body image distress by changing the relationship with those&#xD;
      thoughts. For example, continually repeating or even singing an unwanted thought has been&#xD;
      shown to reduce the believability and discomfort associated with that thought, through a&#xD;
      technique known as cognitive defusion. The current study aims to extend the literature on&#xD;
      cognitive defusion and test its effectiveness in the treatment of body dissatisfaction. In a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial design, 122 female restrained eaters were randomly assigned to&#xD;
      practice either 1) verbally repeating negative body-related thoughts, 2) singing negative&#xD;
      body-related thoughts, 3) verbally repeating body-unrelated thoughts (control), or 4) singing&#xD;
      body-unrelated thoughts (control). The goal of this study was to determine whether singing&#xD;
      one's negative body-related thoughts could lead to greater changes in perception of the&#xD;
      thought, body image satisfaction, mood, and self-esteem relative to a control condition when&#xD;
      practiced twice daily for one week.&#xD;

          <description>A cognitive defusion strategy in which participants repeat a target unwanted thought out loud and as quickly as possible for 60 seconds.&#xD;
Cognitive Defusion: Cognitive defusion aims to change one's relationship to their thoughts - as opposed to changing the content, form, or frequency - by reframing internal experiences as less threatening (Hayes, Luoma, Bond, Masuda, &amp; Lillis, 2006). It is the process of detaching the link between one's thoughts and perceptions of reality and acknowledging the role one's thoughts play in their internal events. A number of techniques have been developed to remove the literal quality of such thoughts, including repeating the thought, and, more recently, singing the thought.</description>

Cognitive Defusion: Cognitive defusion aims to change one's relationship to their thoughts - as opposed to changing the content, form, or frequency - by reframing internal experiences as less threatening (Hayes, Luoma, Bond, Masuda, &amp; Lillis, 2006). It is the process of detaching the link between one's thoughts and perceptions of reality and acknowledging the role one's thoughts play in their internal events. A number of techniques have been developed to remove the literal quality of such thoughts, including repeating the thought, and, more recently, singing the thought.</description>

Cognitive Defusion: Cognitive defusion aims to change one's relationship to their thoughts - as opposed to changing the content, form, or frequency - by reframing internal experiences as less threatening (Hayes, Luoma, Bond, Masuda, &amp; Lillis, 2006). It is the process of detaching the link between one's thoughts and perceptions of reality and acknowledging the role one's thoughts play in their internal events. A number of techniques have been developed to remove the literal quality of such thoughts, including repeating the thought, and, more recently, singing the thought.</description>

Cognitive Defusion: Cognitive defusion aims to change one's relationship to their thoughts - as opposed to changing the content, form, or frequency - by reframing internal experiences as less threatening (Hayes, Luoma, Bond, Masuda, &amp; Lillis, 2006). It is the process of detaching the link between one's thoughts and perceptions of reality and acknowledging the role one's thoughts play in their internal events. A number of techniques have been developed to remove the literal quality of such thoughts, including repeating the thought, and, more recently, singing the thought.</description>

Cognitive Defusion: Cognitive defusion aims to change one's relationship to their thoughts - as opposed to changing the content, form, or frequency - by reframing internal experiences as less threatening (Hayes, Luoma, Bond, Masuda, &amp; Lillis, 2006). It is the process of detaching the link between one's thoughts and perceptions of reality and acknowledging the role one's thoughts play in their internal events. A number of techniques have been developed to remove the literal quality of such thoughts, including repeating the thought, and, more recently, singing the thought.</description>

Cognitive Defusion: Cognitive defusion aims to change one's relationship to their thoughts - as opposed to changing the content, form, or frequency - by reframing internal experiences as less threatening (Hayes, Luoma, Bond, Masuda, &amp; Lillis, 2006). It is the process of detaching the link between one's thoughts and perceptions of reality and acknowledging the role one's thoughts play in their internal events. A number of techniques have been developed to remove the literal quality of such thoughts, including repeating the thought, and, more recently, singing the thought.</description>

Cognitive Defusion: Cognitive defusion aims to change one's relationship to their thoughts - as opposed to changing the content, form, or frequency - by reframing internal experiences as less threatening (Hayes, Luoma, Bond, Masuda, &amp; Lillis, 2006). It is the process of detaching the link between one's thoughts and perceptions of reality and acknowledging the role one's thoughts play in their internal events. A number of techniques have been developed to remove the literal quality of such thoughts, including repeating the thought, and, more recently, singing the thought.</description>

Cognitive Defusion: Cognitive defusion aims to change one's relationship to their thoughts - as opposed to changing the content, form, or frequency - by reframing internal experiences as less threatening (Hayes, Luoma, Bond, Masuda, &amp; Lillis, 2006). It is the process of detaching the link between one's thoughts and perceptions of reality and acknowledging the role one's thoughts play in their internal events. A number of techniques have been developed to remove the literal quality of such thoughts, including repeating the thought, and, more recently, singing the thought.</description>

Cognitive Defusion: Cognitive defusion aims to change one's relationship to their thoughts - as opposed to changing the content, form, or frequency - by reframing internal experiences as less threatening (Hayes, Luoma, Bond, Masuda, &amp; Lillis, 2006). It is the process of detaching the link between one's thoughts and perceptions of reality and acknowledging the role one's thoughts play in their internal events. A number of techniques have been developed to remove the literal quality of such thoughts, including repeating the thought, and, more recently, singing the thought.</description>

Cognitive Defusion: Cognitive defusion aims to change one's relationship to their thoughts - as opposed to changing the content, form, or frequency - by reframing internal experiences as less threatening (Hayes, Luoma, Bond, Masuda, &amp; Lillis, 2006). It is the process of detaching the link between one's thoughts and perceptions of reality and acknowledging the role one's thoughts play in their internal events. A number of techniques have been developed to remove the literal quality of such thoughts, including repeating the thought, and, more recently, singing the thought.</description>

Cognitive Defusion: Cognitive defusion aims to change one's relationship to their thoughts - as opposed to changing the content, form, or frequency - by reframing internal experiences as less threatening (Hayes, Luoma, Bond, Masuda, &amp; Lillis, 2006). It is the process of detaching the link between one's thoughts and perceptions of reality and acknowledging the role one's thoughts play in their internal events. A number of techniques have been developed to remove the literal quality of such thoughts, including repeating the thought, and, more recently, singing the thought.</description>

Cognitive Defusion: Cognitive defusion aims to change one's relationship to their thoughts - as opposed to changing the content, form, or frequency - by reframing internal experiences as less threatening (Hayes, Luoma, Bond, Masuda, &amp; Lillis, 2006). It is the process of detaching the link between one's thoughts and perceptions of reality and acknowledging the role one's thoughts play in their internal events. A number of techniques have been developed to remove the literal quality of such thoughts, including repeating the thought, and, more recently, singing the thought.</description>

Cognitive Defusion: Cognitive defusion aims to change one's relationship to their thoughts - as opposed to changing the content, form, or frequency - by reframing internal experiences as less threatening (Hayes, Luoma, Bond, Masuda, &amp; Lillis, 2006). It is the process of detaching the link between one's thoughts and perceptions of reality and acknowledging the role one's thoughts play in their internal events. A number of techniques have been developed to remove the literal quality of such thoughts, including repeating the thought, and, more recently, singing the thought.</description>

Cognitive Defusion: Cognitive defusion aims to change one's relationship to their thoughts - as opposed to changing the content, form, or frequency - by reframing internal experiences as less threatening (Hayes, Luoma, Bond, Masuda, &amp; Lillis, 2006). It is the process of detaching the link between one's thoughts and perceptions of reality and acknowledging the role one's thoughts play in their internal events. A number of techniques have been developed to remove the literal quality of such thoughts, including repeating the thought, and, more recently, singing the thought.</description>

        <description>The Thought-Shape Fusion Questionnaire was used to assess the extent to which thinking about a forbidden food or behaviour produces a change in one's perception of their body shape and weight. It is a 34-item measure that asks participants to rate how well an item describes them on a 5 point Likert scale from 0 to 4. Total scores can range from 0 to 136, with higher scores indicating greater fusion to body- or food-related thoughts.</description>

A number of techniques have been developed to remove the literal quality of such thoughts, including repeating the thought, and, more recently, singing the thought.</description>

          <title>Self-Rating of Thought-Shape Fusion (Thought-Shape Fusion Questionnaire)</title>
          <description>The Thought-Shape Fusion Questionnaire was used to assess the extent to which thinking about a forbidden food or behaviour produces a change in one's perception of their body shape and weight. It is a 34-item measure that asks participants to rate how well an item describes them on a 5 point Likert scale from 0 to 4. Total scores can range from 0 to 136, with higher scores indicating greater fusion to body- or food-related thoughts.</description>
