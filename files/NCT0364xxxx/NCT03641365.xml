    <textblock>
      To compare virtual planning accuracy of computer-assisted template-based implant placement&#xD;
      using CAD/CAM stereolithographic surgical templates with or without metallic&#xD;
      sleeves.Furthermore to compare open versus closed holes in case of sleeveless templates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any partially edentulous patients requiring at least one implant to be planed according to a&#xD;
      computer-assisted template-based protocol were enrolled. Patients were randomised according&#xD;
      to a parallel group design into two arms: surgical template with or without metallic sleeves.&#xD;
      Three deviation parameters (angular, horizontal, vertical) were defined to evaluate the&#xD;
      discrepancy between the planned and placed implant positions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed as a randomized controlled trial of parallel group design conducted&#xD;
      at one centre, between May 2016 and March 2017. The study was performed after approval was&#xD;
      received from the institutional review board of the Aldent University, Tirana, Albania&#xD;
      (2/2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigation was conducted according to the principles embodied in the Helsinki&#xD;
      Declaration of 1975 for biomedical research involving human subjects, as revised in 2013. All&#xD;
      patients were informed about the nature of the treatment and their written consent was&#xD;
      obtained. Data collection was designed to preserve patient anonymity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Inclusion/exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any partially edentulous patient, aged 18 years or older, able to sign an informed consent,&#xD;
      in need of an implant-supported fixed restoration was considered eligible for this study. Any&#xD;
      potential implant location based on individual patient requirements was considered eligible&#xD;
      in the present trial. Patients were not admitted to the study if any of the following&#xD;
      exclusion criteria was present: general medical contraindication to oral surgery (American&#xD;
      Society of Anesthesiologist, ASA, class III or IV); irradiation in the head and neck area&#xD;
      less than one year before implantation; psychiatric problems; alcohol or drug abuse; pregnant&#xD;
      or nursing; untreated periodontitis; severe bruxism or clenching; uncontrolled diabetes; poor&#xD;
      oral hygiene and motivation; and inability to complete the follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients received preoperative photographs, periapical radiographs or panoramic&#xD;
      x-rays for initial screening and evaluation. The prosthetic-driven planning workflow started&#xD;
      by taking a cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scan (Cranex 3Dx, Soredex, Tuusula, Finland)&#xD;
      by using a wax bite to separate dental arches. Then, the patients received intraoral digital&#xD;
      impression taken using the 3M True Definition Scanner (3M Italia, Pioltello, Milano). The&#xD;
      digital data (STL, STereo Lithography interface format) was imported in a 3D design software&#xD;
      (exocad DentalCAD, Exocad GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) to realize a virtual wax-up according to&#xD;
      the functional and esthetic requirements. Then, the STL and DICOM (Digital Imaging and&#xD;
      COmmunications in Medicine) data were imported in a 3D software planning program (3Diagnosys&#xD;
      ver. 5.0, 3DIEMME srl, Cant√π, Italy). Then, the reprocessed surface extrapolated from the&#xD;
      DICOM data (by using a Hounsfield scale filter) and the surface generated by the master cast&#xD;
      scanning process, or by the intraoral scanning process, were merged with the best-fitting&#xD;
      repositioning tools of the software (3Diagnosys ver. 5.0, 3DIEMME srl). At this point,&#xD;
      prosthetic-driven implants/abutments size and location were planned taking into account the&#xD;
      bone quality and quantity, soft tissue thickness, anatomical landmarks, as well as, type,&#xD;
      volume and shape of the final restoration. After careful functional and esthetic evaluation&#xD;
      and final verification, the prosthetic-driven plan was approved. At this point, patients were&#xD;
      randomly assigned to receive conventional stereolithographic surgical template with (control&#xD;
      group) or without (test group) metallic sleeves. Stereolithographic surgical templates were&#xD;
      designed and fabricated by an independent certified center not previously involved in the&#xD;
      study (New Ancorvis srl, Bargellino, Italy). In the test group, conventional templates with&#xD;
      close-sleeve-design were produced to place implants between premolars. In case of implants to&#xD;
      be place in molar area, template with open sites were produced to solve intermaxillary space&#xD;
      limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Surgical protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hour before implant placement, all patients underwent professional oral hygiene,&#xD;
      prophylactic antiseptic with 0.2% chlorhexidine (Curasept, Curaden Healthcare, Saronno,&#xD;
      Italy) for one minute, and prophylactic antibiotic therapy (2 g of amoxicillin or clindamycin&#xD;
      600 mg if allergic to penicillin). The fit of the surgical templates were accurately tried in&#xD;
      the patient mouth to achieve a stable fit (Fit Checker, GC - Tokyo, Japan). All patients were&#xD;
      treated under local anesthesia using articaine with adrenaline 1:100000 administered 20&#xD;
      minute before surgery. The surgical templates were stabilized on the residual teeth and fixed&#xD;
      with two to three preplanned anchor pins.Hopeless teeth were extracted at the end of the&#xD;
      intervention in order to improve the stability of the surgical template and to provide more&#xD;
      reference point for measurements of the implant accuracy. Nevertheless, in case of immediate&#xD;
      postextractive implants, residual teeth were extracted as atraumatically as possible&#xD;
      immediately before surgery. In the test group, planned implants (Osstem TSIII, Osstem, Seoul,&#xD;
      South Korea) were placed flapless using dedicate drills (OneGuide Kit, Osstem) in combination&#xD;
      with a sleeveless surgical guide. In this case the drills were used directly thought the&#xD;
      sleeve-designed template without metallic tubs and with not the need of drill reductions. In&#xD;
      the control group, planned implants (Osstem TSIII, Osstem, Seoul, South Korea) were placed&#xD;
      flapless using dedicate drills (OsstemGuide Kit[Taper], Osstem) in combination with reduction&#xD;
      tools, within the surgical templates containing metallic sleeves. If the keratinized gingiva&#xD;
      and the amount of bone were adequate, the implants were placed flapless. Otherwise, a flap&#xD;
      was elevated and then the wound was closed with single-stitch sutures using 4.0 resorbable&#xD;
      suture material (Vicryl, Ethicon J&amp;J International, Sint-Stevens-Woluwe, Belgium). Implant&#xD;
      site were prepared based on the bone density evaluated by the surgeon at the first drill. All&#xD;
      the implant were inserted according to a one-stage protocol, with an insertion torque ranging&#xD;
      from 35 to 45 Ncm. In case of poor bone density, the implant site was underprepared.&#xD;
      Immediately after implant placement, patients of both groups receive a digital impression (3M&#xD;
      True Definition Scanner, 3M Italia, Pioltello, Milano) taken at implant level using a&#xD;
      dedicate abutments (Scan body type AQ, New Ancorvis srl), to check the position of the placed&#xD;
      implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following implant placement, all patients received oral and written recommendations about&#xD;
      medication, oral hygiene maintenance and diet. Implants were loaded after 8 to 12 weeks of&#xD;
      healing. Then, patients were followed twice a year for hygiene maintenance and occlusal&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outcome measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Implant failure: an implant was considered to be a failure if it was lost for&#xD;
                mobility, implant fracture and/or any infection dictating implant removal. The&#xD;
                stability of each individual implant was measured manually with a torque of 20 Ncm&#xD;
                at delivery of the final restoration and later, with the prosthesis removed, if&#xD;
                needed (infection, extensive peri-apical bone loss, mucosal inflammation).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Template-related complications: early surgical complications involved the surgical&#xD;
                template comprised limited access in posterior areas, buccal bony dehiscence (due&#xD;
                to a mismatching of the surgical template) evaluated sounding the implant site with&#xD;
                a periodontal probe (PCPUNC156, Hu-Friedy Italy, Milan, Italy) before implant&#xD;
                placement, insertion of different implant than planned, and fracture of surgical&#xD;
                template. All the complications were recorded during follow-up by the same&#xD;
                clinician (Marco Tallarico), who performed all the surgical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Accuracy: Three deviation parameters (horizontal, vertical, and angular) were&#xD;
                defined and calculated between the planned and placed implant positions. The&#xD;
                post-operative STL file, derived from the intraoral scan, was geometrically aligned&#xD;
                with the files exported from the planning, by automated image registration using&#xD;
                maximization of mutual information (Dental SCAN, ver.6, Open Technologies srl,&#xD;
                Brescia, Italy). The horizontal (lateral), vertical (depth) and angular deviation&#xD;
                between virtual and placed implants were calculated along the long axis of each&#xD;
                implants. An expert blinded mechanical engineer (FC) performed all the&#xD;
                measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One computer-generated restricted randomization list was created. Only one of the&#xD;
      investigators, not involved in the selection and treatment of the patients, was aware of the&#xD;
      random sequence and could have access to the randomization lists stored in a&#xD;
      password-protected portable computer. The random codes were enclosed in sequentially&#xD;
      numbered, identical, opaque, sealed envelopes. Envelopes were opened sequentially after the&#xD;
      prosthetic-driven plan was approved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient data were collected in a Numbers spreadsheet (Version 3.6.1 for Mac OS X 10.11.4). A&#xD;
      bio-statistician with expertise in dentistry analyzed the data using SPSS software for Mac OS&#xD;
      X (version 22.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for statistical analysis. Descriptive analysis&#xD;
      was performed for numeric parameters using mean¬±standard deviation and median with confidence&#xD;
      interval (95% CI). Implant failure and template-related complications between the two groups&#xD;
      were compared using Fisher's exact probability test. The mean differences of the overall&#xD;
      deviation in the clinical outcomes compared to the virtual plan, were compared between groups&#xD;
      using a mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). In the sleeve-less group,&#xD;
      accuracy of open versus closed holes were also evaluated. All statistical comparisons were&#xD;
      conducted with a P value set at 0.05.&#xD;
