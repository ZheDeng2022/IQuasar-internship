        This is an observational prospective, non-interventional, open-label, multi-centre national&#xD;
        study. It will provide additional safety information of JARDIANCE DUO®&#xD;
        (empagliflozin/metformin) in Korean patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in a routine&#xD;
        clinical practice setting&#xD;
      </textblock>
    </study_pop>
    <sampling_method>Non-Probability Sample</sampling_method>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have started at first time on JARDIANCE DUO® in accordance with the&#xD;
             approved label in Korea&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥19 years at enrolment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have signed on the data release consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with previous exposure to JARDIANCE®, JARDIANCE DUO®&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypersensitivity to active ingredients empagliflozin and/or metformin or to any of the&#xD;
             excipients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Moderate (stage 3b) and severe renal failure (CrCl &lt; 45 ml/min or eGFR &lt; 45&#xD;
             ml/min/1.73 square meter)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute conditions with the potential to alter renal function such as: dehydration,&#xD;
             severe infection, cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Type1 diabetes, acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis&#xD;
             with or without coma, history of a ketoacidosis (type 1 diabetes and diabetic&#xD;
             ketoacidosis should be treated with insulin).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with&#xD;
             unstable or acute congestive heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiologic studies involving the use of intravascular iodinated contrast materials&#xD;
             (for example, intravenous urogram, intravenous cholangiography, angiography, and&#xD;
             computed tomography (CT) scans with intravascular contrast materials)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intravascular administration of iodinated contrast media may lead to acute renal&#xD;
             failure and has been associated with lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Therefore, in patients with eGFR &gt; 60ml/min/1.73m2, JARDIANCE DUO® must be discontinued&#xD;
        prior to, or at the time of the test and not be reinstituted until 48 hours afterwards, and&#xD;
        only after renal function has been re-evaluated and has not deteriorated further. In&#xD;
        patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 45-60 ml/min/1.73m2), JARDIANCE DUO® must be&#xD;
        discontinued 48 hours before administration of iodinated contrast media and not be&#xD;
        reinstituted until at least 48 hours afterwards, and only after renal function has been&#xD;
        re-evaluated and has not deteriorated further.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In patients with severe infections or severe traumatic systemic disorders, JARDIANCE&#xD;
             DUO® should be temporarily suspended, and should not be restarted until the patient's&#xD;
             oral intake has resumed and renal function has been evaluated as normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  JARDIANCE DUO® should be temporarily suspended for any surgical procedure(except minor&#xD;
             procedures not associated with restricted intake of food and fluids)before 48 hours,&#xD;
             and not be reinstituted until 48 hours afterwards, after renal function has been&#xD;
             evaluated as normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with malnutrition, starvation, hypostheniam pituitary or adrenal&#xD;
             insufficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Impaired hepatic function (since impaired hepatic function has been associated with&#xD;
             some cases of lactic acidosis, JARDIANCE DUO® should generally be avoided in patients&#xD;
             with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease), pulmonary infarction, severe&#xD;
             respiratory impairment, any condition associated with hypoxemia, excessive alcohol&#xD;
             intake, GI disorders such as dehydration, diarrhoea or vomiting&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women, women who may be pregnant, nursing women&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disease which may cause tissue hypoxia (especially acute disease, or worsening of&#xD;
             chronic disease) such as: decompensated heart failure, respiratory failure, recent&#xD;
             myocardial infarction, shock&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current participation in other clinical trials&#xD;

      <recruitment_details>This post-marketing surveillance study re-examined case report forms retrieving at 20 sites from 21 January 2016 till 11 August 2020 for subjects who had Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, and were initially administered Jardiance Duo® following the study start date investigating factors affecting the safety and effectiveness of study drug.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All subjects were screened for eligibility prior to participation in the trial. Subjects attended a specialist site which ensured that they (the subjects) strictly met all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria.&#xD;
Subjects were not to be allocated to a treatment group if any of the entry criteria were violated.</pre_assignment_details>
