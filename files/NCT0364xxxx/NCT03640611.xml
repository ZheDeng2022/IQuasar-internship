  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is a chronic condition that causes the most childhood disabilities on&#xD;
      worldwide. Impairment in movement and posture development seen in children with CP it causes&#xD;
      difficulties in performing activities and affect in emotional, social, and cognitive&#xD;
      abilities cause limited participation in everyday life. The ICF-CY child is divided into five&#xD;
      categories: body structure and functions, activities, participation, environmental and&#xD;
      personal factors, it is treated holistically. Initially, children with CP have adopted the&#xD;
      view that environmental factors can also affect functionality, while focusing on the&#xD;
      treatment of motor disorders to reduce activity and participation limitations in&#xD;
      physiotherapy and rehabilitation applications. Environmental factors; the environment in&#xD;
      which the child lives, his family, the devices he uses, health and care services, and&#xD;
      government policies. These factors vary according to each country's own cultural and economic&#xD;
      opportunities. The investigator planned to do this study because we found that there is a&#xD;
      need for a comprehensive study of children with SP in Turkey, which does not reveal the&#xD;
      relationship between environmental factors and activity and level of participation.&#xD;

      The study consist of two phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. European Child Environment Questionnaire (ECEQ) will translate in to Turkish in the&#xD;
           first phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Forvard translation (translate to Turkish from English)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Expert opinion (Turkish version will control by expert)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Back translation (Turkish version will translate to English)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cultural adaptation Validity and reliability study will done&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The relationship between environmental factors and activity and participation will be&#xD;
           investigated in the second phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2-18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cerebral palsy diagnosed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children or family who understand and speek Turkish language&#xD;

&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical classifications:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) for classifying gross motor function&#xD;
           levels Manuel ability classification system (MACS) for classifying fine motor function&#xD;
           levels Communication Function Classification System (CFCS) for classifying communication&#xD;
           function levels Eating Drinking Abilities Classsification System (EDACS) for classifying&#xD;
           eating and drinking functions levels will be used&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Activity evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Gross Motor Function Measurement (GMFM) Pediatric Evaluation of Disabilty Inventory&#xD;
           (PEDI) will be used&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Life Habits Questionnaire (Life-H) will be used&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Environmental factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
