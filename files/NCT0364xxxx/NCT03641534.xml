  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis and severe malaria together contribute to an estimated 13 million deaths annually, a&#xD;
      great burden of which is in low-income countries. Optimal fluid management is critical yet&#xD;
      remains one of the most challenging clinical care elements as volume overload precipitates&#xD;
      pulmonary edema and volume restriction may exacerbate acute kidney injury. These&#xD;
      complications of sepsis and severe malaria significantly increase mortality, particularly in&#xD;
      resource-limited settings lacking mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy.&#xD;
      Point-of-care ultrasound and passive leg raise testing are two easily implementable, safe and&#xD;
      non-invasive clinical bedside fluid assessment tools that could be applied towards developing&#xD;
      a fluid management algorithm in low resource settings. Similarly, simple tissue perfusion&#xD;
      measures can facilitate understanding of precise indications or contraindication to fluid and&#xD;
      vasopressor therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the performance of these tools has yet to be confirmed in these settings. Accurate&#xD;
      assessment of pulmonary tolerance and fluid responsive patients could aid to tailor&#xD;
      vasopressor and fluid therapy to the patient condition and disease phase, thus preventing or&#xD;
      detecting iatrogenic pulmonary edema and other pulmonary complications. As there is currently&#xD;
      limited evidence supporting fluid management recommendations for severe malaria and sepsis in&#xD;
      low-resource settings, the potential application of these management tools could optimize&#xD;
      supportive therapy and improve outcomes in these populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main activity proposed is a prospective, observational study of patients with sepsis and&#xD;
      severe malaria to describe the relationship between fluid therapy and vasopressor therapy&#xD;
      against measures of tissue perfusion and pulmonary congestion in adult patients with severe&#xD;
      malaria or severe sepsis. In addition, the study will assess the performance of simple&#xD;
      bedside clinical tools assessing fluid responsiveness, pulmonary congestion and peripheral&#xD;
      tissue perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data from this observational study will facilitate the preparation of a follow-up study&#xD;
      to test a clinical algorithm to guide individualized fluid and vasopressor administration.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single center, prospective, longitudinal, observational study of patients with&#xD;
      sepsis or severe malaria. It is planned that this initial observational study will inform a&#xD;
      follow-up intervention study, based on the observational study findings (Lung Ultrasound and&#xD;
      Passive Leg Raising- guided Vasopressors and Fluid Management in Patients with Sepsis and&#xD;
      Severe Malaria). The follow-up study will propose testing of a clinical algorithm to&#xD;
      individualize titration of vasopressors, diuretics and fluids based on the simple tools&#xD;
      evaluated during the observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected duration of study patient participation is 30 days. Patients will be assessed&#xD;
      every 6 hours until fever clearance, parasite clearance (in malaria patients) and GCS&#xD;
      normalization (score of 15) on two consecutive assessments. Thereafter, patients will be&#xD;
      assessed daily until discharge or death with one follow-up visit at 14 days and a follow-up&#xD;
      call at day 30. The prospective, observational recruitment phase of the study is expected to&#xD;
      last 15 months.&#xD;

      Hematocrit and peripheral blood parasitemia in thin and thick films will be assessed at T=0&#xD;
      (enrolment) then 6-hourly until parasite clearance (two consecutive negative thick smears per&#xD;
      500 white blood cells). Plasma creatinine will be measured 24-hourly for 72 hours, at&#xD;
      discharge and day 14. Venous blood gas and lactate will be assessed 6-hourly until lactate &lt;2&#xD;
      mmol/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial blood gas will be collected at T0 and after 24 hours if the subject is in&#xD;
      respiratory distress, defined as respiratory rate &gt; 30 breaths per minute and SpO2 &lt;92% on&#xD;
      room air. More frequent hematological and biochemical measurements may be done if clinically&#xD;
      indicated at the discretion of the treating clinician. Plasma cell-free hemoglobin (CFH) will&#xD;
      be analyzed at hour 0, 6, 24, 48, 72 and day 7 in the severe malaria group and only hour 0 in&#xD;
      sepsis and uncomplicated malaria groups. Blood cultures and additional microbiology assays&#xD;

        the criteria for the latest 2016 sepsis definition, the 2012 Surviving Sepsis Campaign&#xD;
        criteria and the quick SOFA tool will be used for inclusion. However, after study&#xD;
        completion, when all admission SOFA scores will be available, all patients will be&#xD;
