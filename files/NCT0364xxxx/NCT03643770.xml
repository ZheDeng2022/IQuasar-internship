  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there are a variety of approaches utilized in attempts to improve upper extremity&#xD;
      function, including: traditional therapy, neuroprostheses, botulinum toxin injections, or&#xD;
      surgical interventions. In addition, regenerative and restorative therapies, such as:&#xD;
      epidural stimulation, functional electrical stimulation, and stem cell therapies, show&#xD;
      promise in animal models, but are not ready for clinical translation. Subsequently, there is&#xD;
      a clear need to develop new strategies that can stimulate spinal plasticity and strengthen&#xD;
      existing synaptic connections in order to maximize the benefits of training paradigms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes the examine the effects of Acute Intermittent Hypoxia (AIH) in&#xD;
      combination with upper extremity training, over the course of a month, to evaluate changes in&#xD;
      upper extremity function, dexterity, and ability to complete activities of daily living. The&#xD;
      use of acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH) has been demonstrated, through human and animal&#xD;
      studies, to be an effective way of increasing spinal motor excitability and strengthening&#xD;
      residual synaptic connectivity. AIH utilizes short duration (&lt;2 min) exposures to reduced&#xD;
      oxygen levels (~10% inspired oxygen), with alternating exposures to air with normal oxygen&#xD;
      levels (~21% inspired oxygen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous publications demonstrate that AIH is a safe and effective intervention to modify&#xD;
      motor function in individual with chronic incomplete spinal cord injuries. The use of AIH has&#xD;
      been shown to influence the activation in musculature, within 60-120 minutes of&#xD;
      administration. In addition, when coupling AIH with overground gait training, an increase in&#xD;
      functional endurance, as evaluated through the 6 minute walk test, and gait speed, as&#xD;
      evaluated through the 10 meter walk test, were demonstrated. In addition, the use of hypoxic&#xD;
      training has been studied in healthy individuals and athletes; however, literature examining&#xD;
      the effect of a single bout of AIH on performance is limited.&#xD;
