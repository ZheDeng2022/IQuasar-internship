  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early stage Parkinson disease (PD) is characterized by a 'honeymoon' phase in terms of&#xD;
      responsiveness of motor symptoms, including gait, to dopaminergic pharmacotherapy. Advancing&#xD;
      PD is associated with disabling axial motor complications, such as freezing of gait (FoG),&#xD;
      with decreased or even refractory dopamine responsiveness in over 50% of patients. The&#xD;
      management of dopamine resistant gait problems represents the most important unmet need in&#xD;
      PD. This study will related detailed motor testing to brain PET imaging to see if certain&#xD;
      molecules (or lack thereof) involved with neurologic transmission in the brain are involved&#xD;
      with FoG.&#xD;

      Early stage Parkinson disease (PD) is characterized by a 'honeymoon' phase in terms of&#xD;
      responsiveness of motor symptoms, including gait, to dopaminergic pharmacotherapy. Advancing&#xD;
      PD is associated with disabling axial motor complications, such as freezing of gait (FoG),&#xD;
      with decreased or even refractory dopamine responsiveness in over 50% of patients. The&#xD;
      management of dopamine resistant gait problems represents the most important unmet need in&#xD;
      PD. At present, there is no biomarker of FoG in patients with PD as there is a lack of&#xD;
      mechanistic understanding of dopamine nonresponsiveness of FoG. The investigators have&#xD;
      previously identified cholinergic denervation as a prominent factor related to both falls and&#xD;
      gait slowing in PD. The investigators recently identified that cortical -amyloid deposition&#xD;
      not only associates with cognitive decline but also with postural instability and gait&#xD;
      difficulties in PD. In this proposal, the investigators present preliminary data suggesting&#xD;
      that FoG is associated with either cholinopathy, amyloidopathy or both in PD. The&#xD;
      investigators propose to test the novel hypothesis that comorbid amyloidopathy may be a&#xD;
      possible mechanistic factor underlying the poor response of FoG to dopaminergic therapy in&#xD;
      advancing PD. In contrast, isolated cholinopathy would be expected to be associated with&#xD;
      preserved dopamine responsiveness of FoG. For this purpose, the investigators propose to&#xD;
      perform detailed motor, including FoG, testing in PD patients &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; their&#xD;
      dopaminergic medications and relate this to dopaminergic 11C-DTBZ, vesicular acetylcholine&#xD;
      transporter 18F-FEOBV and -amyloid 11C-PIB brain PET imaging in PD subjects with and without&#xD;
      FoG. Furthermore, based on recent clinical observations that serotoninergic drugs, like the&#xD;
      popular anti-depressant SSRI drugs, are associated with significantly lower build- up of&#xD;
      -amyloid plaques in the elderly population, and based on the investigators' subsequent&#xD;
      observation of an intriguing inverse relationship between -amyloid plaque deposition and&#xD;
      striatal serotoninergic terminal in PD, the investigators propose to perform an exploratory&#xD;
      sub-study to test a new hypothesis that PD subjects with FoG will exhibit not only higher&#xD;
      striatal -amyloid but also lower striatal serotoninergic innervation (as determined by&#xD;
      11C-DASB serotonin PET imaging) compared to PD subjects without FoG. If confirmed, positive&#xD;
      findings in this study would allow the identification of different PD subgroups&#xD;
      ('personalized medicine'), such as presence amyloidopathy or cholinopathy, to select patients&#xD;
      for targeted pharmacotherapies to potentially prevent the development of FoG (anti-amyloid,&#xD;
      such as serotoninergic drugs) or manage its clinical manifestation (cholinergic augmentation&#xD;
      therapy) in order to preserve and maintain a good quality of life in individuals with PD.&#xD;
