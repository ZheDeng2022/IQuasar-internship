  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The safety run-in portion of this study is designed to identify the optimal dose of&#xD;
      VSV-IFNβ-NIS in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with solid tumors and follows the&#xD;
      3+3 design. The expansion portion will use one-sample binomial designs to assess the efficacy&#xD;
      of the combination in patients with refractory NSCLC or NEC. The optimal dose (RP2D)&#xD;
      determined in the dose escalation portion of the trial will be used for the expansion&#xD;
      portion. The study has been conducted with a dose of 1.7 × 1010 as the recommended phase II&#xD;
      dose in an expansion cohort of 10 patients with NSCLC. However, current data suggests that&#xD;
      VSV-IFNβ-NIS doses of up to 1.7 × 1011 is safe and likely more efficacious. Thus, this study&#xD;
      will test a second VSV-IFNβ-NIS dose level, 1.0x1011 TCID50. A safety assessment will be&#xD;
      carried out after 3 patients are enrolled. If this dose schedule is well tolerated and virus&#xD;
      PK are not negatively impacted, both the NSCLC and NEC expansion cohorts will open using this&#xD;
      dose schedule. If 2 of the first 3 patients or 2 of the first 6 patients experience a DLT,&#xD;
      the dose will be de-escalated to 5 x 1010. The safety run-in/dose escalation portion of this&#xD;
      study is expected to require a minimum of 3 patients and a maximum of 18 patients (6 patients&#xD;
      per dose level). The expansion portion of this study is expected to require a minimum of 10&#xD;
      per cohort. The NSCLC and NEC patients enrolled at the identified optimal dose in the dose&#xD;
      escalation cohort would be included in the dose expansion cohort if they are evaluable for&#xD;
      the primary endpoint in the expansion portion (4 dose escalation patients at the optimal dose&#xD;
      are expected to roll over to the expansion). Therefore, the overall sample size will be a&#xD;
      maximum of 40 patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      All patients will be dosed with VSV-IFNβ-NIS on day 1. For Part A, Part B [Group 1], and Part&#xD;
      C [Group 1] pembrolizumab will be administered on day 1 (concurrent pembrolizumab dosing).&#xD;
      For Part A, and Parts B and C [Group 2] pembrolizumab may be administered on day 8 (delayed&#xD;
      pembrolizumab dosing). pembrolizumab treatment will continue Q3W per the Keytruda® USPI, with&#xD;
      efficacy evaluations after cycle 2 then every 9 weeks until PD.&#xD;
