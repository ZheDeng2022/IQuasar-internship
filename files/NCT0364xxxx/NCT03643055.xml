      To assess the diagnostic accuracy of 18F-Fluorocholine PET/CT for the detection of medullary&#xD;
      thyroid cancer in patients with primary and recurrent disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is a relatively rare type of cancer that represents up to 10%&#xD;
      of all primary thyroid cancers. It is a neuroendocrine tumour derived from parafollicular&#xD;
      C-cells of the thyroid. It occurs either sporadically or in a hereditary form as a component&#xD;
      of the type 2 multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes, MEN2A and MEN2B, and the related&#xD;
      syndrome, familial MTC (FMTC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the diagnosis of MTC is suspected based on the results of fine-needle aspiration&#xD;
      (FNA) cytology, immunohistochemical analysis and elevated laboratory values of tumour markers&#xD;
      calcitonin (Ctn) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). According to the 2015 ATA guidelines,&#xD;
      the preoperative imaging workup in all patients should include ultrasound examination of the&#xD;
      neck; in selected patients, contrast-enhanced CT of the neck and chest, three-phase&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced multi-detector liver CT, or contrast-enhanced MRI of the liver, and axial&#xD;
      MRI and bone scintigraphy is also recommended. The curative therapy of choice is surgical&#xD;
      removal of the tumour and/or metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nodal metastases are detected in 35-50% and distal metastases in about 15% of patients with&#xD;
      primary MTC. Even with currently recommended diagnostic imaging techniques, about 50% of&#xD;
      patients have persistent/recurrent disease after surgical treatment. This implies that&#xD;
      currently available diagnostic imaging studies are suboptimal for accurate disease staging.&#xD;
      New hybrid molecular imaging techniques based on SPECT/CT and especially PET/CT could improve&#xD;
      disease detection by visualising pathophysiological processes in vivo. The most studied PET&#xD;
      radiopharmaceutical for MTC imaging to date has been 18F-FDOPA, with recent studies focusing&#xD;
      also on somatostatin receptor imaging using 68Ga-DOTATATE/TOC/NOC radiotracers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      18F-fluorocholine is a structural analogue of choline. It accumulates in cells with active&#xD;
      membrane synthesis and overexpressed intracellular signal transduction, processes that are&#xD;
      overactive in benign and malignant neoplasms. 18F-fluorocholine is currently primarily used&#xD;
      for prostate cancer imaging. In contrast to radiotracers such as18F-fluorodeoxyglucose&#xD;
      (18F-FDG), it is also taken up by well-differentiated neoplasms in which 18F-FDG uptake is&#xD;
      unreliable. Similarly to 18F-FDG, 18F-fluorocholine is also known to accumulate in inflamed&#xD;
      and infected tissue. However, this limitation could be overcome by performing&#xD;
      multi-time-point imaging and using basic kinetic analysis. The working hypothesis is that&#xD;
      18F-fluorocholine might be efficiently taken up by primary MTC tumour as well as&#xD;
      loco-regional and distant metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the trial is to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of 18F-fluorocholine PET/CT in&#xD;
      comparison to existing imaging modalities (US, CT and MRI).&#xD;
