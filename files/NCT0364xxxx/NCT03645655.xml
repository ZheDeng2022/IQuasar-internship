  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although hepatic tumors are uncommon in the perinatal period they are associated with&#xD;
      significant morbidity and mortality in affected patients. The study is intended to evaluate&#xD;
      the diagnostic efficiency of Protein Induced by Vitamin K Absence or antagonist-II(PIVKA-II)&#xD;
      combining with alpha-fetoprotein in hepatic tumor of infant. This study is a multicenter&#xD;
      study joined by several hospitals in China. Participants including hepatoblastoma, hepatic&#xD;
      hemangioendothelioma and healthy control are consecutively recruited into the cohort. All the&#xD;
      serum samples are collected before and after each treatment and will be tested in single&#xD;
      center in order to decrease bias. Serum samples were tested for PIVKA-II, alpha-fetoprotein&#xD;
      and biochemical indexes including alanine aminotransferase(ALT), aspartate&#xD;
      aminotransferase(AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase(GGT), alpha-l-fucosidase(AFU), etc.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatic tumors seldom occur in the perinatal period. They comprise approximately 5% of the&#xD;
      total neoplasms of various types occurring in the fetus and neonate. Infantile&#xD;
      hemangioendothelioma is the leading primary hepatic tumor followed by hepatoblastoma.&#xD;
      Although alpha-fetoprotein has been well recognized as biomarker of hepatic tumors, it should&#xD;
      be mentioned that this protein in normal infants is highly elevated during the first 2 months&#xD;
      of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protein induced by vitamin K antagonist-II (PIVKA-II), also known as des-γ-carboxyprothrombin&#xD;
      (DCP) or acarboxy prothrombin, is an abnormal form of prothrombin induced by vitamin K&#xD;
      absence or antagonist-II. An elevated serum level of PIVKA-II is reported to be associated&#xD;
      with hepatocellular (HCC). Many studies have shown that PIVKA-II is applicable for HCC&#xD;
      surveillance and has been written into the guideline of JSH, which achieves remarkably good&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is intended to evaluate diagnostic and differential diagnostic accuracy of PIVKA-II&#xD;
      combining with alpha-fetoprotein in hepatic tumor of infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a multicenter study joined by several hospitals in China. Participants&#xD;
      including hepatoblastoma, hepatic hemangioendothelioma and healthy control. All the serum&#xD;
      samples are collected before and after each treatment and will be tested in single center in&#xD;
      order to decrease bias. Serum samples were tested for PIVKA-II, Alpha-fetoprotein(AFP)， and&#xD;
      biochemical indexes including ALT, AST, GGT, AFU, etc. The diagnosis of hepatoblastoma and&#xD;
      hepatic hemangioendothelioma was based on enhanced CT scanning and/or histopathology. The&#xD;
      Student's t-test (or Mann-Whitney test) was used to compare continuous variables, and the&#xD;
      chi-square test (or Fisher's exact test) was used for categorical variables. A receiver&#xD;
      operator characteristic (ROC) curve was used to assess the diagnostic and differential&#xD;
      diagnostic efficiency of PIVKA-II and the combined tumor markers with AFP.&#xD;
