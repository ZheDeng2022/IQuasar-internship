  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a Phase III, multisite, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, with two parallel&#xD;
      groups. The groups are SDF or placebo and they are applied every 6 months. The primary&#xD;
      hypothesis of the trial is that SDF is better than placebo for stopping cavities with dentin&#xD;
      exposed in baby teeth when assessed at 6 months after initial application.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a phase III, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled superiority trial,&#xD;
      with two parallel groups (placebo vs. SDF applied to cavitated lesions) involving a total of&#xD;
      1144 children with the primary outcome assessed at 6 months after initial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One thousand one hundred forty four children, 12-71 months of age, from early childhood&#xD;
      education programs, such as Head Start centers, Early Head Start centers, and equivalent&#xD;
      city/state subsidized preschool programs, or children attending dental clinics associated&#xD;
      with the clinical trial sites, will be randomized, in two cohorts. Trial visits will occur at&#xD;
      baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 8 months. SDF/placebo will be applied at baseline and 6&#xD;
      months. Parents/legal guardians will be called 24 to 48 hours after the SDF/placebo&#xD;
      application to assess adverse events and unanticipated problems and in-person visits for&#xD;
      safety exams will be available for all child participants approximately 24 to 48 hours after&#xD;
      SDF/placebo application. This visit could happen before or after the 24- to 48-hour call with&#xD;
      the parent or legal guardian, but every attempt will be made so that the call occurs prior to&#xD;
      the 24- to 48-hour visit. Additionally, intermediate contacts at 1.5 months, 4.5 months, and&#xD;
      7 months will occur to determine if the child needs an additional visit to assess pain,&#xD;
      lesion progression, etc. and to maintain contact with the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization to SDF application (treatment) or placebo (control) will be at the&#xD;
      participant-level; all teeth within a participant that meet the inclusion criteria will&#xD;
      receive the same trial product. Both treatment and control will be dispensed from identical&#xD;
      unit-dose ampules coded and labeled to ensure masking of all trial personnel. The number of&#xD;
      ampules required to treat all carious lesions in the participant's mouth will be recorded. No&#xD;
      caries removal will be performed. Teeth will be cleaned with a toothbrush and will be dried&#xD;
      with cotton/gauze, and the solution will be painted on the dentin of each targeted cavitated&#xD;
      lesion using a standardized applicator. Following application, the tooth will be blotted dry&#xD;
      with gauze.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each clinical visit International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS)&#xD;
      examinations, including cavitated lesion hardness assessments, soft tissue assessments and&#xD;
      questionnaires on dental discomfort, family impact and treatment satisfaction and&#xD;
      acceptability will be collected.&#xD;

    <description>The presence of pain associated with a trial tooth will be defined as a score of 1 or higher using the Dental Discomfort Questionnaire (DDQ), which can be associated with a trial tooth during a clinical visit. The DDQ is a validated tool that assesses pain in children 5 and younger, as reported by parents/legal guardians as proxies, based on the observation of toothache pain-related behaviors by the child. It consists of two parts. The first part includes a question concerning the occurrence of toothache and when (if no pain DDQ score of 0, best). The second part consists of 8 validated questions about different behaviors associated with toothache or discomfort due to caries. Each item can be answered on a three-point scale: 0 'never', 1 'sometimes', and 2 'often'. If there is toothache the total score is calculated by adding the scores to the 8 questions in part two, and ranges from 0 (no pain) to 16 (worse score).</description>
