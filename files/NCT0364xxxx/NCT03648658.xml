      1. Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
                Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
                The aim of the project is to study the pharmacokinetics of therapeutic doses of&#xD;
                paracetamol with specific emphasis on the contributions of the metabolites&#xD;
                (glucuronide, sulphate, cysteine and mercapturate), in patients with spinal&#xD;
                muscular atrophy(SMA), patients with cerebral palsy(CP), and patients with SMA or&#xD;
                CP admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), in comparison with healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
                The secondary aim is to compare the safety of paracetamol in patients with SMA, CP&#xD;
                and patients with SMA or CP admitted to the ICU, with healthy controls. The&#xD;
                investigators would like to assess the influence of age and physiologic covariates&#xD;
                (body weight and inflammation markers) on paracetamol pharmacokinetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Background Today there are approximately 15.000 patients with neuromuscular&#xD;
                disorders in Denmark. This includes the group of patients with muscular wasting.&#xD;
                SMA is an example of a neuromuscular disease, where the patients have low skeletal&#xD;
                muscle mass. The disease is located in the anterior cells in the spinal cord. This&#xD;
                affects the cells that are supposed to send signals about muscle contraction&#xD;
                through the nerve pathways, and causes muscle wasting. Spinal muscular atrophy is a&#xD;
                hereditary disease caused by a mutation in the Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) 1-gene.&#xD;
                SMN is necessary for normal nerve function in the muscles. The patients with SMA&#xD;
                have a back-up gene called Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) 2-gene. However, most of the&#xD;
                SMN 2-gene cannot be used, because of a missing part in the gene called exon 7.&#xD;
                Spinal muscular atrophy is divided into three different types, based on the child's&#xD;
                motor skills and when the first symptoms appear. Children with SMA type I&#xD;
                experience symptoms within the first six months of life. The children will never&#xD;
                experience to sit by themselves without help. They seldom get older than two years;&#xD;
                even though it depends on how much intensive respiratory care they receive. The&#xD;
                onset of symptoms for children with SMA type II is between 5 and 12 months of age.&#xD;
                They usually get diagnosed before they reach the age of 1-2 years. The children&#xD;
                will be able to sit by themselves, but will not be able to walk and stand without&#xD;
                help. Children with SMA II can get a normal life span. SMA type III is the mildest&#xD;
                form. The onset of the symptoms appears after the child is 18 months of age, and&#xD;
                the child will be able to walk independently. (1) Cerebral palsy (CP) is another&#xD;
                example of a patient group with low muscle weight. CP is caused by a brain damage&#xD;
                which occurs either during foetal life, during birth or in the neonatal period. The&#xD;
                brain damage occurs in connection to premature birth, oxygen deficiency, infections&#xD;
                or blood clots. However, often the specific cause cannot be detected. Every year&#xD;
                180 children with CP are born in Denmark. The disease will not worsen with time,&#xD;
                but the symptoms will change gradually as the child grows up. Incorrect positions&#xD;
                of joints and bones may occur with time.(2) The investigators have experienced that&#xD;
                two patients with SMA II developed acute liver failure, most likely due to&#xD;
                paracetamol toxicity. In line with this a case study from 2011 reported that&#xD;
                patients with myopathies and muscular atrophies might be at increased risk of&#xD;
                toxicity, resulting in acute liver failure, while receiving the recommended dose of&#xD;
                paracetamol.(3) Another two cases with similar stories has been described in boys&#xD;
                with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.(4) Children and young adults with low muscle mass&#xD;
                have several risk factors that may increase the susceptibility to paracetamol.&#xD;
                First of all, they have a reduced skeletal muscle mass compared to bodyweight.(5)&#xD;
                Glutathione (GSH) is a low-molecular-weight thiol, consisting of the amino acids&#xD;
                glutamate, cysteine and glycine. Most of the glutathione synthesis occurs in the&#xD;
                liver and it is stored in the majority of cells in the body. It has been suggested&#xD;
                that skeletal muscle has a remarkable GSH synthesizing ability and high activity of&#xD;
                GSH-dependent enzymes. This suggest that skeletal muscle is a major player for the&#xD;
                whole body GSH metabolism.(6) We hypothesize that the patients with spinal muscular&#xD;
                atrophy, has a lower concentration of glutathione compared to healthy subjects, due&#xD;
                to the fact that they have a low skeletal muscle mass. This is relevant because&#xD;
                glutathione detoxifies the oxidative metabolite in the paracetamol metabolism.&#xD;
                Furthermore, there is a tendency that children and young adults with low muscle&#xD;
                mass are malnourished and have a tendency to become critically ill. Several studies&#xD;
                have shown that there may be a correlation between malnutrition, fasting, critical&#xD;
                illness and glutathione deficiency.(7-9) Lastly, paracetamol is relatively&#xD;
                hydrophilic, and the volume of distribution of paracetamol would be further reduced&#xD;
                in patients with low muscle mass, thus increasing plasma levels.(10) Paracetamol is&#xD;
                commonly used to treat mild-to-moderate pain or to reduce opioid exposure, as part&#xD;
                of multimodal analgesia treatment in patients with SMA and CP. In therapeutic&#xD;
                doses, about 90% of paracetamol is conjugated in the liver to nontoxic metabolites&#xD;
                (glucuronides and sulphates). A small portion (approximately 5 -10 %) is conjugated&#xD;
                by cytochrome P450 CYP2E1 to a toxic metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzo-quinone imin&#xD;
                (NAPQI). This metabolite is further conjugated by glutathione to a neutral&#xD;
                metabolite and excreted in the urine as cysteine and mercapturate metabolites.(11)&#xD;
                In toxic doses, the usual metabolic pathways are overwhelmed; paracetamol is&#xD;
                shunted to the cytochrome P450 pathway, and glutathione stores are depleted.&#xD;
                Cellular injury and hepatic necrosis occur as NAPQI accumulates.(8) The paracetamol&#xD;
                metabolism pathways are slightly different in young children compared to adults. In&#xD;
                young children up to 12 years of age, the glucunoride pathway is deficient. The&#xD;
                sulphate pathway is the dominant conjugation pathway, and the half-time is&#xD;
                prolonged.(12) Patients with low muscle mass may need a lower loading and&#xD;
                maintenance doses of paracetamol. However, since only one of the three metabolic&#xD;
                pathways of paracetamol (i.e the CYP2E1- mediated pathway) is involved in&#xD;
                hepatotoxicity, it is important to explore the separate contributions of the&#xD;
                different metabolic pathways.(13) Elevations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in&#xD;
                the bloodstream are measured as a biomarker, regarding to hepatic events and&#xD;
                toxicity. ALT is an enzyme usually found inside the liver cells, however if the&#xD;
                liver is damaged or inflamed, it could be released in to the bloodstream. A&#xD;
                prospective study of ALT elevations in healthy adults receiving therapeutic doses&#xD;
                of paracetamol exists.(14) However, paracetamol kinetics and liver affection has to&#xD;
                our knowledge never been studied in patients with low muscle mass before.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators would like to conduct a prospective study of the safety and toxicity&#xD;
           related to paracetamol treatment in children and young adults with respectively SMA and&#xD;
           CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study will provide new and important knowledge about the potential risk involved&#xD;
           with paracetamol treatment in therapeutic doses in patients with low muscle mass. If the&#xD;
           investigators find that paracetamol in therapeutic doses are toxic in patients with SMA&#xD;
           and CP, the results will be implemented in new national and international guidelines for&#xD;
           treatment of pain in patients with SMA and CP, to prevent acute liver failure and&#xD;
           potential death, thus improving prophylactic care for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
           A prospective, non-randomised, open label, single site clinical trial. Data from the&#xD;
           adult patients will be compared to a group of healthy controls for comparison of the&#xD;
           primary and secondary outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data from the children will be compared with data from the literature on healthy&#xD;
           children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be treated with paracetamol in therapeutic doses, 15mg/kg/dose every six&#xD;
      hour, with a maximum dosage of 1 g x 4 per day, for three consecutive days. Blood samples&#xD;
      will be collected before treatment, during the uptake of the first dose, and after the uptake&#xD;
      of the first dose of paracetamol. The same procedure will be performed after three days of&#xD;
      paracetamol treatment.&#xD;
