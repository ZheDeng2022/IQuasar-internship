      BACKGROUND Anal abscess and perianal fistula is a high prevalence disorder in general&#xD;
      population that affect adult patients on young ages, affecting them significantly their&#xD;
      social and quality of life. There is clinical evidence that the origin of most perianal&#xD;
      fistulas (60%) is with an episode one year before of a perianal abscess. In fact, the&#xD;
      established cryptoglandular hypothesis considered the origin of anal fistula, a chronic&#xD;
      infectious disease starting on a clinical episode of an anal glands abscess. However,&#xD;
      controversy exists regarding the role of antibiotics in the development of anal fistula after&#xD;
      incision and drainage of perianal abscess. Nowadays, only two single-centre randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials has been published addressing this issue, with inconclusive results. The&#xD;
      MAIN OBJECTIVE of the study is to examine the clinical benefit of antibiotic therapy in&#xD;
      patients with a perianal abscess, to avoid the development of a perianal fistula. METHODOLOGY&#xD;
      We designed a prospective, multicentre double-blind placebo trial to analyse the clinical&#xD;
      benefit of a course of antibiotics after perianal abscess drainage to diminish the&#xD;
      probability of development of perianal fistula in the follow up of patients. Patients with&#xD;
      anal abscess will be allocated randomly either to receive 7 days of oral&#xD;
      metronidazole/ciprofloxacin in addition to their standard care or to receive standard care&#xD;
      and placebo, after they will be discharged from the hospital. Patients will be followed&#xD;
      clinically at different intervals during one year in order to know if they develop anal&#xD;
      fistula. Also a quality of life assessment at the end of the study will be evaluated.&#xD;
      EXPECTED RESULTS We expected that patients allocated to antibiotic treatment would develop a&#xD;
      significant less anal fistulas in their follow-up with a related significant better quality&#xD;
      of life. Thus, a change on standard of care led by our group, may be achieved.&#xD;

      METHODS This project is a 3-year study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicentre, double-blind placebo trial to investigate the effect of oral&#xD;
      antibiotics after anal abscess drainage to diminish the development of an anal fistul.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Clinical Trial will consist of two parallel study groups with a (1:1) randomization,&#xD;
      masking by double-blind technique and placebo control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants of this study will be eligible among those who will be attended on the&#xD;
      emergency department of each participant hospital during inclusion period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include patients who come to the emergency room due to perianal abscesses and&#xD;
      who will be incised and drained of the lesion by local anaesthesia (in emergency boxes) or by&#xD;
      regional or general anaesthesia (in the operating room). A standard procedure will be&#xD;
      followed with draining the purulent contents and then instilling a solution composed of&#xD;
      saline and iodine through the wound; as well as manual exploration and lysis of intracavity&#xD;
      septa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all cases as it it standardized, the wound will be left open with insinuated gauze or a&#xD;
      latex drainage (Penrose) when necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients, once selected, will be randomly distributed (by specific software) in two&#xD;
      parallel groups, in one of which the intervention will be evaluated. In the study group,&#xD;
      patients will receive oral treatment with Ciprofloxacin at a dose of 500 mg every 12 hours&#xD;
      and Metronidazole 500 mg every 8 hours for a period of 7 days. The control group will receive&#xD;
      two types of placebo tablets that look identical to Ciprofloxacin and Metronidazole&#xD;
      respectively, with similar doses and frequencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative controls and follow-up will be carried out at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after&#xD;
      treatment and will include an endoanal ultrasound (US) at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studied variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following variables will be analysed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Epidemiological variables: Age, gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Smoking status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comorbidities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obesity (Body Mass Index)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cultures of abscess&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characteristics of anal abscess: Location, type of drainage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Selected arm: Group treatment (antibiotics) vs. Control group (placebo)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical follow up (anal fistula or not) at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of anal fistula is standarized by specialist in General Surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of anal fistula developed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endoanal US at 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life (general health with SF-36 test and an specific test related to quality&#xD;
           of life in patients with anal fistula, both tests validated to Spanish language) at 12&#xD;
           months (end of follow up)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the patients with diagnosis of perianal abscess treated with incision and drainage were&#xD;
      included, the objective of our study will be to evaluate the proportion of patients who&#xD;
      developed perianal fistula between the two study groups (with oral antibiotics and with&#xD;
      placebo). It will be recorded as the presence of a perianal fistula when the participants&#xD;
      present a history of symptoms compatible with it, as well as the existence of a communication&#xD;
      between the perianal cutaneous tissue and the anal canal during the clinical examination&#xD;
      performed or even evidenced in the endoanal ultrasound during the controls that will be&#xD;
      carried out up to 12 months after the intervention. For better evaluation and registration&#xD;
      abscesses will be classified according to their complexity: subcutaneous, intersphincteric,&#xD;
      ischiorectal and according to their anatomical location: anterior, posterior, lateral, right&#xD;
      and left. These data will be collected at the time of the surgical exploration during the&#xD;
      initial treatment with incision and drainage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fistulas will be classified by Parks classification in the following: subcutaneous,&#xD;
      intersphinterian, transphincteric, suprasphinteric, extraphincteric. These data will be&#xD;
      collected at the time of the clinical examination during the controls.&#xD;
