      This study is designed as an open-label evaluation of how treatment with XR-NTX may influence&#xD;
      the quality and speed of recovery of opioid dependent individuals - in a context of a&#xD;
      naturalistic clinical treatment of opioid dependence. The study will assess recovery outcomes&#xD;
      and compare these with the clinical effectiveness of XR-NTX (use of illicit substances and&#xD;
      safety). Further, the study will assess the recovery outcomes in matched controls receiving&#xD;
      treatment with buprenorphine or buprenorphine-naloxone and enrolled in the national OMT&#xD;
      program, and compare this with participants receiving XR-NTX.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, treatment study of how treatment with extended-release&#xD;
      naltrexone hydrochloride injectable suspension (Vivitrol®) (later referred to as XR-NTX) 380&#xD;
      mg/4 weeks will influence or promote the psycho-social recovery and somatic and psychiatric&#xD;
      health in opioid dependent individuals. Further the study will investigate the effectiveness&#xD;
      and safety of XR-NTX treatment given in a naturalistic setting as an alternative to OMT. The&#xD;
      study period is 24 weeks and a subsequent 28 week follow up study. The study is composed of&#xD;
      three &quot;Work Packages&quot; (WP). From the same participating sites, a control group of 150&#xD;
      subjects matched on age and gender and currently enrolled in the OMT program receiving daily&#xD;
      treatment with either oral buprenorphine or buprenorphine-naloxone will be recruited.&#xD;
      Controls will be compared with study participants on psycho-social aspects of recovery and&#xD;
      mental and somatic health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WP1 will use XR-NTX in a clinical naturalistic setting to describe change or improvement in&#xD;
      recovery and in illicit drug use for this novel treatment of opioid dependent subjects. A&#xD;
      total of n=150 participants will be recruited from three urban hospitals and community health&#xD;
      services in Norway to receive treatment with XR-NTX. From the same hospitals and community&#xD;
      health services we will also recruit a control group of 150 subjects matched on age and&#xD;
      gender already enrolled in the OMT and receiving flexible dose of buprenorphine or&#xD;
      buprenorphine-naloxone. The control group will be used for outcomes related to psycho-social&#xD;
      recovery and health issues only. There will not be any comparison of use of illicit&#xD;
      substances between the XR-NTX and control group. After inclusion in the study and a baseline&#xD;
      assessment, the XR-NTX subjects will be followed-up on a monthly basis by the Principal&#xD;
      investigator or delegated site personnel. At each visit an injection of XR-NTX will be&#xD;
      administered and through an interview, data will be obtained on the use of heroin and other&#xD;
      illicit substances, physical and mental health, housing and family situation, income and&#xD;
      other social aspects. A urine or saliva sample will be obtained at every visit and screened&#xD;
      for opioids and other illicit substances. Fertile women will in addition be screened for&#xD;
      pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparison group will be assessed at baseline, after 24 weeks and after 52 weeks only.&#xD;
      Study personnel will not administer any medication to subjects in the comparison group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From XR-NTX participants, a blood sample will be obtained at baseline (or at a later visit)&#xD;
      for genetic analyses to identify possible genetic biomarkers that may predict the outcome of&#xD;
      treatment with XR-NTX and possible markers of low catecholaminergic expression&#xD;
      (ADHD-spectrum) Community health services from each catchment area that facilitate the&#xD;
      recovery process involving community- and specialized health services, will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in the study to assess the XR-NTX participants' recovery process every 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controls will be assessed by the same community health services on their longer term recovery&#xD;
      process at week 24 and at week 52.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of the descriptive elements in the participant's recovery process will be&#xD;
      performed using brief structured interviews with the involved health-and social workers.&#xD;
      Interviews can be done by telephone or on the net such as teleconference, if feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WP 2 will use qualitative interviews to investigate the subjects' perspective on enablers and&#xD;
      barriers to agreeing to and remaining in treatment with, a long-acting opioid receptor&#xD;
      antagonist (XR-NTX), including possible emotional reactions and psycho-social implications of&#xD;
      treatment. Data will be collected through a) individual semi-structured interviews with&#xD;
      approximately 40 of the 150 XR-NTX participants: 20 subjects who stay in treatment for more&#xD;
      than 12 weeks and 20 subjects who receive at least one injection XR-NTX but drop out before&#xD;
      12 weeks. In addition, 3 focus group interviews, each with 6-8 close relatives of study&#xD;
      subjects will be performed in order to investigate their conceptions regarding the recovery&#xD;
      process of their opioid addicted family member; possible changes in familial cohesion and&#xD;
      social relationships, and their own need for support and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WP 3 is a health-economic study on the cost of XR-NTX treatment in study participants&#xD;
      compared to treatment with buprenorphine or buprenorphine-naloxone (OMT) in the controls.&#xD;
      Since the cost of medication is only one part of the total health cost of opioid dependence,&#xD;
      we will try to estimate the total cost of health- and social services for this group of&#xD;
      participants based on national registry data, hospital records and records from GPs and&#xD;
      social workers. Registry-based information will be collected based on participants' personal&#xD;
      identity number (PIN).&#xD;
