  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the early stage of the study, the CT-guided micro-coil locating method for pulmonary small&#xD;
      nodules was optimized. This study will use a single set of target values non-randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the optimized pre-loaded&#xD;
      micro-coil locating method in pulmonary small nodules.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A series of optimization and improvement measures were tried for the complications of the&#xD;
      CT-guided micro-coil locating method. After discussion, the method of micro-coil pre-loaded&#xD;
      in the puncture needle and sealed first, and then for subsequent locating has more&#xD;
      advantageous. The method avoids the direct penetration of the puncture needle into the&#xD;
      atmosphere during operation, and the operation is simpler. In vitro tests of isolated lung&#xD;
      specimens and pre-tests of 9 clinical patients were carried out. The results showed that this&#xD;
      method not only reduced the number of operators on site, but also had the tendency to shorten&#xD;
      the operation time, reduce the incidence of pneumothorax, and improve the success rate.&#xD;
      However, there is currently no rigorous scientific research to provide objective evidence for&#xD;
      its safety and effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study intends to use a single set of target values non-randomized controlled&#xD;
      trials to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the optimized pre-loaded micro-coil&#xD;
      locating method in pulmonary small nodules.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study intends to use a single set of target values for non-randomized controlled trials, and enrolled 120 subjects who met the inclusion criteria. The small pulmonary nodules were located using an optimized pre-loaded microcoil puncture positioning method. Observe the clinical indicators such as pneumothorax incidence rate, positioning success rate, other complication rate, operation time, and number of operators, and evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the optimized CT-guided pulmonary nodule microcoil localization technique.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Pneumothorax definition: The chest radiograph is examined in the lateral position half an hour after positioning. If a clear pneumothorax line is seen on the chest radiograph, that is, the boundary line between the atrophic lung tissue and the pleural cavity, the pneumothorax is considered to occur.</description>
