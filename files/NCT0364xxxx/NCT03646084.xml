  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Musculoskeletal pain has become in a major problem related to its prevalence, treatment cost,&#xD;
      absenteeism, quality of life impairment, disability and drugs consumption. The difficulty in&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain control ends in the abuse of drugs by these patients, including opioids.&#xD;
      This drugs consumption has become a health problem in the United States and around the world&#xD;
      related to their increasing abuse mainly between 2002 and 2011 and has had an impact in the&#xD;
      numbers of deaths caused by opioids prescription (reaching 16,651 deaths in United States in&#xD;
      2010). Pain is clearly associated with sleep disturbances (50-80% of these patients suffer&#xD;
      from a sleep problem), and in turn poor sleep quality leads to increased pain sensitivity.&#xD;
      There is evidence showing that improving sleep disturbance co-occurring pain would improve,&#xD;
      and some may reduce the use of opioids in specific patients on long-term opioid therapy. In&#xD;
      spite of this reciprocal relationship between sleep and pain only few programs take into&#xD;
      account the management of sleep disorders as a non-pharmacological measure for pain control.&#xD;
      The hypothesis is: &quot;to address sleep and circadian disorders (SCD) using a Sleep and&#xD;
      Circadian Intervention Program (SCIP) in patients treated with rehabilitation by chronic&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain (CMP) optimizes the rehabilitation outcomes and reduces opioids&#xD;
      consumption&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main goal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this PILOT study is to evaluate the feasibility of the protocol of the present&#xD;
      study that aims to assess the improvement in rehabilitation outcomes and decrease in opioid&#xD;
      consumption, through the management of sleep disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology Using a randomised (1:1) controlled feasibility study, 50 men and women will be&#xD;
      included to evaluate methodology and identify the potential outcome of the main project.&#xD;
      Subjects older than 18 years included in a rehabilitation program by musculoskeletal lumbar&#xD;
      pain lasting more than three months will be recruited. Basal Visit (BV): After the signature&#xD;
      of informed consent, a medical history, physical exam, evaluation of the pain perception&#xD;
      (EQ5D5L), quality of life evaluation (SF36 and FOSQ), mood and anxiety (HADS y PASS20),&#xD;
      circadian rhythm study and drugs consumption will be evaluated in both groups. Patients will&#xD;
      be randomized to control group (usual rehabilitation program) or intervention group (usual&#xD;
      rehabilitation program + sleep circadian intervention program-SCIP). The patient in the SCIP&#xD;
      program will received the next intervention: 1) Educational and circadian rhythm&#xD;
      intervention: general sleep hygiene recommendation and promotion of daily physical activity.&#xD;
      2) Sleep studies for sleep quality and sleep disorders diagnosis: full polysomnography 3)&#xD;
      Sleep questionnaires for another sleep disorders. Based on the results of the studies,&#xD;
      patients will be treated according to current guidelines for the management of sleep&#xD;
      disorders. 6 month after the SCIP starts patients will be evaluated in the End of Study Visit&#xD;
      (EOS) as in the BV and also in their functional improvement and health resources consumption.&#xD;

      Hypothesis: to address sleep and circadian disorders (SCD) using a Sleep and Circadian&#xD;
      Intervention Program (SCIP) in patients treated with rehabilitation by chronic&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain (CMP) optimizes the rehabilitation outcomes and reduces opioids&#xD;
      consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Main Objective of this PILOT study is to evaluate the feasibility of the protocol of the&#xD;
      present study that aims to assess the improvement in rehabilitation outcomes and decrease in&#xD;
      opioid consumption, through the management of sleep disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of the PILOT study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To identify the primary outcome to evaluate the hypothesis. Evaluate relevance and&#xD;
           observed change of the main outcome for the main study. It will allow investigators to&#xD;
           evaluate the effect size and variability of the SCIP in the opioids consumption in a&#xD;
           sample of our population to determine if this is the potential outcome for the main&#xD;
           project.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the patient inclusion rhythm (recruitment rate) and, if necessary, the&#xD;
           reasons for non-recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the follow-up rate and reasons for loss to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To test the sleep circadian study's methodology in this type of population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To assess the acceptability, implementation and preliminary efficacy of the SCIP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To evaluate adherence and fidelity to the SCIP through recruitment and retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To determine the data acquisition rate, amount of missing data and reasons for loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. To evaluate the safety of the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. To characterize the effect observed in the intervention in order to properly calculate&#xD;
           the sample size necessary for the main study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of study: This study aims to be the pilot project of a large-scale international&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial that will include a total of 1.000 patient internationally. In&#xD;
      this pilot study, using a randomised (1:1) feasibility study, 50 patients in a rehabilitation&#xD;
      program referred to treatment for CMP lumbar pain will be recruited. The pilot study will&#xD;
      have a total duration of 18 months (12 months of recruitment + 6 months follow-up) and all&#xD;
      the interventions included in the methodology of the main study will be carried out in the&#xD;
      participating patients. As a feasibility trial, aspects of feasibility will be determined and&#xD;
      estimates of effect size and measured variability will be calculated to inform future planned&#xD;
      study. The data for this study will be collected from standard measures administered in their&#xD;
      basal visit (BV), immediately prior to the initiation of the SCIP, and 6 months after the&#xD;
      initiation of the program (End of study visit-EOS). Randomisation to allocate participants to&#xD;
      either intervention or control group will be performed immediately following the baseline&#xD;
      assessment, and intervention delivery (SCIP) will begin directly after the BV. Participants&#xD;
      will be then reassessed at 6 months after the baseline (EOS) as in the BV and for functional&#xD;
      improvement and health resources consumption. Inclusion criteria: 1) Subjects older than 18&#xD;
      years 2) Inclusion in a rehabilitation program by musculoskeletal lumbar pain lasting more&#xD;
      than three months 3) Patients have no severe reading or learning difficulty 4) Signature of&#xD;
      informed consent. Exclusion criteria: 1) Severe psychopathological co-morbidity (e.g. the&#xD;
      presence of schizophrenia, bipolar disorders…) 2) Co-morbid malignant/terminal diseases (e.g.&#xD;
      HIV/AIDS, cancer) 3) Shift-workers and people who work making transmeridian travels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will provide written consent for their data to be used in an anonymized form for&#xD;
      research purposes and project will have ethics and research and development committee&#xD;
      approval prior to the start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basal Visit: All participants will be asked to provide in the BV the basic demographic&#xD;
      information, medical characteristics (age, gender, job, medication), pain characteristics&#xD;
      (pain cause, time, location and intensity) and a basic physical exam (blood pressure, height,&#xD;
      weight, neck, hip and waist circumference), a drugs test will be performed to assess opioids&#xD;
      consumption and a circadian rhythm study (individual activity rhythms will be measured&#xD;
      noninvasively with Kronowise® [with European Community marking for this indication] in all&#xD;
      patients). To evaluate the effect of the SCIP pain reduction may not be sufficient for a&#xD;
      comprehensive evaluation of the overall benefit of the intervention. The complexity of&#xD;
      chronic pain and its negative impact on diverse aspects of function should be evaluated: 1a.&#xD;
      To evaluate the improvement of pain perception and pain intensity control: pain intensity,&#xD;
      sensory pain ratings and affective pain ratings will be measured before and after the&#xD;
      intervention in both groups. To provide this multidimensional assessment of pain the 5-level&#xD;
      EQ-5D version (EQ-5D-5L) will be completed in basal visit and after intervention.1b. To&#xD;
      evaluate the improvement in quality of life (QoL) measured it will be measured by QoL&#xD;
      questionnaires (SF36 and FOSQ) before and after the intervention and 1c. To measure the&#xD;
      improvement in mood and anxiety patients will answer the Hospital Anxiety and Depression&#xD;
      Scale (HADS) and Pain Anxiety Symptoms (Scale-PASS20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups: The patients will be selected by their rehabilitation doctor who will establish the&#xD;
      indication and dose of the necessary medication to control the pain, according to the&#xD;
      criteria of conventional clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 Control group. Rehabilitation according to current clinical practice. 2 SCIP group.&#xD;
      Rehabilitation according to current clinical practice + specific actions in the treatment&#xD;
      group (the next action in this point 2 will be undergo only in the SCIP group): 2a.&#xD;
      Educational and circadian rhythm intervention: 2a. I - General sleep hygiene recommendations.&#xD;
      2a. II - Promotion of daily physical activity: determine sleep circadian patterns during&#xD;
      rehabilitation: Each participant will record his/her sleep periods in a sleep log. In&#xD;
      addition, individual rest/activity, distal skin temperature and light exposure rhythms will&#xD;
      be measured noninvasively with a watch-like device (Kronowise ®) during 7 consecutive days&#xD;
      and nights. Sleep disturbances as sleep onset latency longer than 30 minutes, more than two&#xD;
      waking episodes per night, total sleep time shorter than 6.5 hours or a sleep efficiency&#xD;
      lower than 85% will be take into account and submitted to the specialist if necessary.&#xD;
      Specific circadian habits modification advise or treatment will be given depending in the&#xD;
      results. All this information will be collected and analysed to determine sleep and circadian&#xD;
      hygiene and the circadian rhythms of the above-mentioned variables in the BV and after the&#xD;
      SCIP (EOS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2b. Describe the sleep disorders related to chronic pain by applying sleep studies to&#xD;
      evaluate sleep quality and to diagnose sleep disturbances during rehabilitation: full&#xD;
      Polysomnography 2c. Describe other sleep disorders by applying specific questionnaires: To&#xD;
      evaluate quality of sleep the Pittsburgh questionnaire will be performed, the Epworth&#xD;
      Sleepiness scale to assess daytime hypersomnolence and to diagnose other sleep disorders such&#xD;
      as insomnia and restless legs syndrome (RLS) the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and the RLS&#xD;
      criteria will completed respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2d. Therapeutic intervention related to the results obtained in the mentioned studies (2 a, b&#xD;
      and c): advice/treatment will be recommended to determine the effect of the specific&#xD;
      interventions decided (pharmacological or non-pharmacological) related to SCD detected in 2&#xD;
      a,b and c. Based on the results of the studies, patients will be treated according to current&#xD;
      guidelines for the management of sleep disorders and taking into account the following&#xD;
      recommendations: 1) Interventions that improve rest/activity rhythms: Sleep Hygiene, bright&#xD;
      light therapy and noise control, time of exercise and feeding. 2) To treat and control Sleep&#xD;
      Disorder Breathing (including adaptive servo-ventilation and bi-level positive airway&#xD;
      pressure ventilation for Central Sleep Apnea if needed). 3) To improve anxiety, depression&#xD;
      and insomnia (to apply bright light therapy and refer to a specialist if needed). 4) To treat&#xD;
      Legs Restless Syndrome if needed. 5) To try opioid dose reduction. 6) To trial of non-opioid&#xD;
      therapies (NSAIDs, antiepileptic drugs, physical therapy, antidepressants…) in lieu of&#xD;
      opioids. 7) Avoiding use of benzodiazepines, sedatives, hypnotics. 8) Caution against alcohol&#xD;
      use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples extraction will be obtained from all participants at the beginning of&#xD;
      rehabilitation and at the end of follow-up to study to measure serum levels of inflammatory&#xD;
      and oxidative stress biomarkers implicated in pain control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EOS visit: After 6 months of the initiation of the SCIP the BV measurements will be repeated&#xD;
      and also an evaluation of the functional improvement and consumption of health resources. The&#xD;
      impact of the SCIP will be evaluated in the next aspects: 1a. Improvement of pain perception&#xD;
      and pain intensity control. 1b. Improvement in quality of life (QoL). 1c. Improvement in mood&#xD;
      and anxiety. 1d. Physical functioning improvement: activity registers from Kronowise ® will&#xD;
      be used to assess the physical activity rhythm improvement (specific measures of the affected&#xD;
      musculoskeletal component). 1e. Consumption of health resources (pharmacological and&#xD;
      non-pharmacological): Pharmacological consumption: Patient pharmacologic sleep and pain&#xD;
      agents and dosing will be recorder at basal visit and after the sleep intervention: opioid&#xD;
      analgesics, benzodiazepine receptor agonists, nonbenzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor&#xD;
      agonists, melatonin receptor agonists, antidepressants, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants,&#xD;
      general analgesic and antihistaminic drugs. Non-pharmacological consumption: days of&#xD;
      rehabilitation treatment, visits to emergency department, hospitalization related to pain or&#xD;
      CP treatment, duration of sick leave (days of work absenteeism). 1f. Improvement of the&#xD;
      circadian system parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics and Safety: There are no expected serious adverse events (SAEs) in this study. The&#xD;
      proposed procedures carry minimal risk to participants, and their care and comfort will be&#xD;
      ensured throughout. This research will be performed in accordance with the International&#xD;
      Conference on Harmonisation-Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) standards. Research Ethics&#xD;
      Service ethical approval will be sought and confirmed before the start of the trial. The&#xD;
      study will be overseen by a steering committee who will act as the data-monitoring committee&#xD;
      to consider adverse effects and/or lack of adherence to the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: As this was a feasibility study, a sample size calculation was not performed.&#xD;
      The study aimed to recruit 50 patients randomized (1:1) to control group (usual&#xD;
      rehabilitation and circadian rhythm study) or intervention group (usual rehabilitation&#xD;
      program + sleep circadian intervention program-SCIP) in patients under rehabilitation&#xD;
      treatment by musculoskeletal chronic pain on the opioids consumption. Data from key outcome&#xD;
      measures were later used to determine the sample size for a definitive trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Descriptive statistics of mean (standard deviation) or median&#xD;
      [interquartile range (IQR)] were estimated for quantitative variables with a normal or&#xD;
      non-normal distribution, respectively, while absolute and relative frequencies were used for&#xD;
      qualitative variables. Normal distribution was analysed using the Shapiro-Wilks test.&#xD;
      Participant characteristics were compared using Student's test, analysis of variance (ANOVA),&#xD;
      or non-parametric Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests for non-normal distribution. The&#xD;
      statistical level of significance was fixed at 0.05. All analyses were performed using R&#xD;
      statistical software, version 3.4.2.&#xD;
