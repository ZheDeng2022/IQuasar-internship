  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Disorders of platelet function are characterized by variable mucocutaneous bleeding&#xD;
      manifestations and excessive hemorrhage following surgical procedures or trauma. Generally,&#xD;
      most patients have mild to moderate bleeding manifestations with a prolonged bleeding time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet aggregation and secretion studies using platelet-rich plasma (PRP) provide evidence&#xD;
      for platelet dysfunction but are neither predictive of severity of clinical manifestations&#xD;
      nor the molecular mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glanzmann's thrombasthenia (GT) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic bleeding syndrome&#xD;
      characterized by defects in platelet aggregometry. The clinical phenotype of patients with GT&#xD;
      is variable. Some suffer from severe bleeding, while others have only mild bleeding. Some&#xD;
      studies found bleeding severity in GT was influenced by the abundance and functioning of&#xD;
      platelet receptors involved in aggregation and adhesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to a complete medical history, a GT diagnosis requires a comprehensive laboratory&#xD;
      workup, including platelet aggregation analysis, and a confirmation by flowcytometry or&#xD;
      western blotting with monoclonal antibodies that recognize the GPIIb/IIIa complex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet flow cytometry is an emerging tool in diagnostic and therapeutic hematology. It is&#xD;
      eminently suited to study the expression of platelet surface receptors both qualitatively as&#xD;
      well as quantitatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study:-&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the role of flowcytometry as a quantitative measurement tool of platelets&#xD;
           surface glycoproteins in patients with inherited thrombocytopathies and its correlation&#xD;
           with bleeding severity of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the efficacy, advantages and disadvantages between platelets flowcytometry&#xD;
           and aggregometer in diagnosing various inherited thrombocytopathies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a case-control observational study to be done at Clinical pathology department,&#xD;
      Assiut University hospital, Assiut University, Egypt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with inherited qualitative platelets defect with clinical manifestations in the form&#xD;
      of mucocutaneous bleeding or hemorrhage will be included in the study. Individuals with&#xD;
      similar age and sex distribution to the patient group will act as controls. Control group&#xD;
      shouldn't take medications or anti-platelet drugs for the preceding two weeks. They should&#xD;
      have normal platelet count and morphology. Bleeding patients with acquired bleeding,&#xD;
      coagulation defects, and those on anti-platelet drugs will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Patients with inherited platelets function disorders will be subjected to:-&#xD;
&#xD;
      I - Careful history and clinical examination data collecting including:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical history of bleeding such as (Sites, Severity and frequency of bleeding, trauma&#xD;
      related events, history of surgical procedures, history of menorrhagia in females, history of&#xD;
      packed red cell/ platelets transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II - Family history such as consanguinity, bleeding complications in any parents/ siblings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III - Grading of bleeding severity: according to World Health Organization (WHO) bleeding&#xD;
      assessment scale from grade 1 to grade 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following routine investigations will be done:-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Complete blood count (CBC) analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prothrombin time, concentration and international normalized ratio (INR) assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Activated partial thromboplastin time assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Fibrinogen level and thrombin time assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following specific investigations:-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Platelets aggregation tests by aggregometer using four different agonists (ADP,&#xD;
           Collagen, Arachidonic acid and ristocetin) on Bio/Data PAP-8E.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Flowcytometry analysis of platelets receptors (CD 41, CD 61 and CD 42b) on BD&#xD;
           FACSCalibur flowcytometry instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and analysis will be done by computer program SPSS version 21 Chicago USA.&#xD;
      Data expressed as mean ±SD, mean±SE, number and percentage. Using Manwhitny test to determine&#xD;
      the significance for numeric variable and chisquare to determine the significance for&#xD;
      non-parametric variable. ROC curve was done to determine the area under curve (AUC),&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity for each marker.&#xD;

Platelet flow cytometry is an emerging tool in diagnostic and therapeutic hematology. It is eminently suited to study the expression of platelet surface receptors both qualitatively as well as quantitatively.&#xD;
Flow cytometry rapidly measures the specific characteristics of a large number of cells in suspension. Typically, the cells are labeled with fluorescently conjugated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).</description>
