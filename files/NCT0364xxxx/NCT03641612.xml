      • Grouping: The patients will be randomly assigned into two equal groups Group : OneShape&#xD;
      Group: ProtaperNext&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endodontics procedure steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Patient will be anesthetized by using infiltration local anesthesia or nerve block&#xD;
                according to the tooth location in mandibular or maxillary arch respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. All caries will be removed, then isolation using rubber dam, the crown and&#xD;
                surrounding structures will be disinfected with 30% H2O2( hydrogen peroxide) for 30&#xD;
                seconds, followed by 2.5% NaOCl for the same period of time and then inactivated&#xD;
                with 5% sodium thiosulphate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2- For the access cavity preparation, a sterile/apyrogenic high-speed diamond bur will&#xD;
           be used in conjunction with manual irrigation with sterile saline. Before entering the&#xD;
           pulp chamber, the access cavity will be disinfected according to the protocol described&#xD;
           above.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2- Root canal length will be determined, by preoperative radiograph then (S1) will be&#xD;
           taken by introducing a sterile/apyrogenic paper point #15/ 20 (5paper points) into the&#xD;
           full length of the canal and left there for 1 minute. Then, the sample will be placed in&#xD;
           an apyrogenic glass and stored in -20°. Then canal length will be confirmed by apex&#xD;
           locator.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3- Cleaning and shaping will be done using either One shape or Protaper next rotary&#xD;
           instruments in crown down preparation technique with the use of in an endodontic motor&#xD;
           according to the manufacturer instructions, the canals will be thoroughly irrigated&#xD;
           using 3ml of 2.5% Sodium hypochlorite between every subsequent instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4-After root canal preparation, NaOCl will be inactivated with 5 mL of sterile 5% sodium&#xD;
           thiosulphate for 1 minute, which then will be removed with 5 mL of sterile/apyrogenic&#xD;
           saline solution., which then will be removed with 5 mL of sterile/apyrogenic saline&#xD;
           solution. second endotoxin sample (S2) will be taken from the root canals. (5 paper&#xD;
           point size of the master cone).&#xD;
&#xD;
           5- After completion of instrumentation and irrigation, obturation will be done using&#xD;
           size 30/ 0.4 taper gutta-percha cones and auxiliaries as needed using the modified&#xD;
           single cone technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of Endotoxin Concentration Human endotoxin (ET) ELISA Kit will be used to&#xD;
      measure endotoxin concentrations in the root canals before and after chemomechanical&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;

      Materials and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Trial Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial design of this study will be a prospective, parallel, Randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      (RCT). The clinical trial involves research using human participants. In this trial, the&#xD;
      participants will be randomly allocated to receive one of two interventions according to the&#xD;
      protocol created by the investigator; one of these interventions will be the control. The&#xD;
      investigator is to determine the safety and/or the efficacy of the interventions after being&#xD;
      received by the participants by measuring the outcomes because the outcomes will be measured,&#xD;
      RCTs are quantitative studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Grouping: The patients will be randomly assigned into two equal groups according to the&#xD;
      type of rotary endodontic system used during root canal preparation: Group : OneShape Group :&#xD;
      ProtaperNext&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endodontics procedure steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Patient will be anesthetized by using infiltration local anesthesia or nerve block&#xD;
                according to the tooth location in mandibular or maxillary arch respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. All caries will be removed, then isolation using rubber dam, the crown and&#xD;
                surrounding structures will be disinfected with 30% H2O2 ( hydrogen peroxide) for&#xD;
                30 seconds, followed by 2.5% NaOCl for the same period of time and then inactivated&#xD;
                with 5% sodium thiosulphate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2- For the access cavity preparation, a sterile/apyrogenic high-speed diamond bur will&#xD;
           be used in conjunction with manual irrigation with sterile saline. Before entering the&#xD;
           pulp chamber, the access cavity will be disinfected according to the protocol described&#xD;
           above.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2- Root canal length will be determined, by preoperative radiograph then (S1) will be&#xD;
           taken by introducing a sterile/apyrogenic paper point #15/ 20 (5paper points) into the&#xD;
           full length of the canal and left there for 1 minute. Then, the sample will be placed in&#xD;
           an apyrogenic glass and stored in -20°. Then canal length will be confirmed by apex&#xD;
           locator.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3- Cleaning and shaping will be done using either One shape or Protaper next rotary&#xD;
           instruments in crown down preparation technique with the use of in an endodontic motor&#xD;
           according to the manufacturer instructions, the canals will be thoroughly irrigated&#xD;
           using 3ml of 2.5% Sodium hypochlorite between every subsequent instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4-After root canal preparation, NaOCl will be inactivated with 5 mL of sterile 5% sodium&#xD;
           thiosulphate for 1 minute, which then will be removed with 5 mL of sterile/apyrogenic&#xD;
           saline solution., which then will be removed with 5 mL of sterile/apyrogenic saline&#xD;
           solution. second endotoxin sample (S2) will be taken from the root canals. (5 paper&#xD;
           point size of the master cone).&#xD;
&#xD;
           5- After completion of instrumentation and irrigation, obturation will be done using&#xD;
           size 30/ 0.4 taper gutta-percha cones and auxiliaries as needed using the modified&#xD;
           single cone technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6- All procedures will be done in a single-visit, checked radiographically and recorded&#xD;
           in the procedure chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of Endotoxin Concentration Human endotoxin (ET) ELISA Kit will be used to&#xD;
      measure endotoxin concentrations in the root canals before and after chemomechanical&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a parameter for calculation of the amount of endotoxins in the root canal samples, a&#xD;
      standard curve will be plotted by using the endotoxin of known concentration supplied by the&#xD;
      kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test procedure will be performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. And the&#xD;
      absorbance of endotoxins will be measured by using spectrophotometer at wavelength 450 nm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the antibacterial effect of using One Shape and Protaper Next rotary endodontic&#xD;
      NiTi instruments for root canal preparation using Human endotoxin (ET) ELISA Kit&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization will be done in three steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sequence generation:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The random sequence generation will be done for the patients' numbers (from 1 to 38)&#xD;
           using Microsoft Excel software.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Allocation concealment mechanism:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The allocation concealment will be phone-based.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Implementation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The random sequence will be done by a colleague and the random sequence table will be kept&#xD;
      with him. After eligibility assessment, the operator would call the colleague for eligibility&#xD;
      checking and to know the group assignment for the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F. Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants, outcome assessor and data analyst will be blinded in this trial. The operator&#xD;
      will be not blinded.&#xD;
