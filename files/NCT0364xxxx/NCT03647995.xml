  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of probiotics containing 25Bn&#xD;
      (billion) CFU (colony-forming unit) of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Sacchromyces boulardii and&#xD;
      Bifidobacterium breve in the prevention of antibiotic induced diarrhea and Clostridium&#xD;
      difficile diarrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chosen population consists of 190 hospitalized patients taking antibiotics. Preselected&#xD;
      and randomized patients will take probiotics once daily until 1 week after the course of&#xD;
      antibiotic is over or a placebo with 0 CFU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is to detect the occurrence of an antibiotic-associated diarrhea. The&#xD;
      secondary outcome is to assess the presence of Clostridium difficile toxins in stool culture.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) and Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) are&#xD;
      a common nosocomial complication following antibiotic use. AAD and CDAD are most importantly&#xD;
      associated with an increase in morbidity and mortality -especially in the elderly population-&#xD;
      thus also contributing to a significant financial burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was reported that 5-25% of patients on antibiotics will develop an AAD of which 10-20% are&#xD;
      caused by Clostridium difficile. Furthermore, the widespread use of broad spectrum&#xD;
      antibiotics is contributing to the increased incidence of CDAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adult human intestinal tract contains up to 100 trillion micro-organisms. This microbiota&#xD;
      is essential and injury to this barrier can result in multiple GI diseases such as infection&#xD;
      by pathogens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probiotics are defined as &quot;live micro-organisms which when administered in adequate amounts&#xD;
      confer a health benefit on the host&quot; [WHO 2007]. Many studies suggest that the use of&#xD;
      probiotics and probiotic containing milks will significantly decrease the risk of AAD and&#xD;
      maybe even CDAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized double-blind, placebo controlled trial using probiotics containing&#xD;
      25 Bn (billion) CFU of which: 5Bn CFU Lactobacillus rhamnosus, 5Bn CFU Sacchromyces&#xD;
      boulardii, 5Bn CFU Bifidobacterium breve, 4.5Bn CFU Bifidobacterium lactis, 2.5 Bn CFU&#xD;
      Lactobacillus acidophilus, 2.5Bn CFU Lactobacillus plantarum and 500Mn (million) CFU&#xD;
      Lactobacillus reuters or a placebo containing 0 CFU in order to assess the role of probiotics&#xD;
      in the prevention of AAD and CDAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diarrhea is defined as more than two liquid stools for a period greater than 3 days and which&#xD;
      is considered by the patient as an increase in stool quantity compared to regular basis. This&#xD;
      issue will be recorded by the intern/resident. However; if the patient starts his antibiotic&#xD;
      regimen in the hospital and is later discharged at home; the patient will be kept in direct&#xD;
      contact with a specific intern/resident and will inform him of the presence of diarrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of Clostridium Difficile Toxins A and/or B while on antibiotics and for a month&#xD;
      after that will be assessed in the context of diarrhea in hospitalized patients only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our patients will be recruited from Hotel-Dieu de France hospital. This includes patients of&#xD;
      all ages who are prescribed antibiotics (single or multiple; oral or IV) assuming that they&#xD;
      are able to eat/drink so that they can take the probiotic pills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients also need to be able to sign a consent form by themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups (probiotic and placebo) will begin treatment within a maximum of 48 hours after&#xD;
      the start of the antibiotic regimen and for the entire duration of antibiotic therapy. This&#xD;
      regimen will be continued a week after the antibiotic therapy is stopped. Researchers will&#xD;
      verify patients' compliance on a daily basis in the hospital and on a weekly basis once the&#xD;
      patient is discharged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria are the following: diarrhea on admission; bowel pathology that could&#xD;
      result in diarrhea (eg. IBD), bowel surgeries and pouches; immunocompromised state (including&#xD;
      febrile aplasia, immunosuppressive therapy, ICU patients, HIV-positive patients and renal&#xD;
      transplant patients); prosthetic heart valves or history of endocarditis and rheumatic heart&#xD;
      disease; use of metronidazole, vancomycin or fidaxomycin prior to stool culture for&#xD;
      Clostridium difficile toxins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Via our computerized medical system, investigators will be able to identify patients who&#xD;
      start an antibiotic regimen. Those who match the trial's inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
      will be included in the trial after a written consent form is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hospital pharmacy will provide them with probiotic or placebo boxes each containing 30&#xD;
      capsules that look similar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the antibiotic regimen is finished, the probiotic/placebo course is continued for&#xD;
      another week with a final follow up 4 weeks after the last course of antibiotics. If the&#xD;
      patient is discharged before the end of his antibiotic course, he will be given enough&#xD;
      probiotics/placebo until the end of his antibiotic course and for a week after that. Those&#xD;
      patients will be followed with a weekly phone call and a final follow up 4 weeks after the&#xD;
      last course of antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient presents with diarrhea in the hospital, a stool sample will be collected to&#xD;
      check for Clostridium Difficile Toxins A and B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If these cultures come back positive, the probiotic/placebo regimen is then stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to detect an absolute difference of 20% between the proportion of patients in the&#xD;
      placebo group with AAD (considered 30%) and the probiotic group (considered 10%) with Î±=0.05&#xD;
      and a power of 90% we estimated that we needed a sample size of 164 (82 in each group).&#xD;
      Researchers furthermore considered a 10% risk of loss of contact with the patient and&#xD;
      therefore estimated a sample size of 180 (90 in each group).&#xD;

The intern/resident who will recruit a patient in the study will not be in direct contact with the pharmacy.&#xD;
The order will be sent to the pharmacy which, following a randomization sheet, will then send a neutral box containing a probiotic or a placebo product.&#xD;
Only once the trial comes to an end, the investigator will receive from the pharmacy the randomization sheet and will then know which patient was given a probiotic and which was given a placebo regimen.</masking_description>
