      The purpose of this study is to strengthen school achievement and positive mental health, and&#xD;
      to prevent and reduce school dropout and mental distress among high school students. The&#xD;
      researchers will scale up techniques that have already been proven highly effective in&#xD;
      preventing common mental disorders (depression, anxiety) in high risk groups (indicated and&#xD;
      selective prevention). The researchers will disseminate these techniques to entire first year&#xD;
      classes of high school students irrespective of risk factors (universal prevention). The&#xD;
      study will report whether universal delivery in school of &quot;Mind Power&quot; - a Cognitive&#xD;
      Behaviour Therapy (CBT) based programme - will strengthen school grades, self-efficacy,&#xD;
      self-esteem, self-regulation, mental perceptions and well-being, and prevent and reduce&#xD;
      school dropout, and symptoms of anxiety and depression. In addition the researchers will&#xD;
      analyse whether such universal delivery prevents more mental distress, and is more&#xD;
      cost-effective than when it is delivered only to those at high risk for school failure,&#xD;
      dropout, or mental distress.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Mind power (MTE) is a modification of the Coping With Depression (CWD) course (Lewinsohn,&#xD;
      Weinstein, &amp; Alper, 1970; Lewinsohn, Antonuccio, Steinmetz, &amp; Teri, 1984). CWD is by far the&#xD;
      most studied psycho-educational intervention (Cuijpers, Muños, Clark., &amp; Lewinsohn, 2009). No&#xD;
      other study has, however, tested these aims on a version of CWD. MTE is &quot;The Adolescent&#xD;
      Coping with Depression Course (ACDC)&quot; (Børve, 2012). In Norwegian: &quot;Depresjonsmesting for&#xD;
      ungdom (DU)&quot; and the newest version is &quot;Mestringskurs for ungdom -DU&quot;. (The name &quot;ACDC&quot; has&#xD;
      been changed to &quot;MTE&quot; in this project to capture the target group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Norway, unlike physical health training (e.g. gymnastics), mental skills training (e.g.&#xD;
      psychological techniques in CBT) is normally reserved for individuals in treatment or at risk&#xD;
      for developing mental disorders. However, especially in Australia and USA, universal mental&#xD;
      skills training programmes in schools have shown positive long-term effects (e.g. Harden et&#xD;
      al., 2001; Wells, Barlow., &amp; Stewart-Brown, 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will address how innovative research may contribute to the development of&#xD;
      high quality education in Norway, and how to strengthen adolescents' resilience and&#xD;
      empowerment in order to meet the challenges in society and work life. If the results in our&#xD;
      project are positive, this project may have great impact on policy making in the areas of&#xD;
      both education and public mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background. Why promote mental health and prevent ill-health? Depression costs society more&#xD;
      than any other illness (Helsedirektoratet, 2015) and is one of the greatest contributors to&#xD;
      burden of disease in Norway (Folkehelseinstituttet, 2016). Twelve per cent of both boys and&#xD;
      girls in Norway report that they experience symptoms of depression (NOVA, 2014). Up to 80% of&#xD;
      adolescents with mental health problems do not receive any treatment (Essau; 2005;&#xD;
      Zachrisson, Rödje &amp; Mykletun, 2006). Individuals (especially boys) in need of help can be&#xD;
      reluctant to contact the mental health system because of stigma associated with mental health&#xD;
      problems (Gulliver, Griffiths &amp; Christensen, 2010). Universally providing mental health&#xD;
      skills in schools to enhancing young people's social and emotional skills may compensate for&#xD;
      this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dropouts from high School. Approximately 30% of adolescents in Norway do not complete high&#xD;
      school. Approximately one third who drop out end up on disability benefit due to mental&#xD;
      illness, mainly depression (Øverland, Glozier, Krokstad, &amp; Mykletun, 2007; Sikveland, 2013).&#xD;
      Internalizing problems (anxiety and depression) seems to affect dropout significantly&#xD;
      (Melkevik et al., 2016). This has severe consequences for later work abilities, socioeconomic&#xD;
      status and economic support (disability pensions) (Falch &amp; Nyhus, 2011; Bergslie 2013).&#xD;
      Because of the relationship between school motivation, mental health and academic&#xD;
      achievements, it may be important to include all adolescents (Masten et al., 2005; Gustavsson&#xD;
      et al., 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduce social differences. Adolescents with multicultural backgrounds seek less help from the&#xD;
      mental health system (Guribye &amp; Sam, 2008). Individuals without higher education receive less&#xD;
      help from specialists (Jensen, 2009; Mykletun, Skogen, &amp; Knudsen, 2010). These groups may&#xD;
      benefit from mental health skills taught in high schools, independently of socio-economic&#xD;
      background. If the MTE intervention works, fewer adolescents may dropout from school.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initiatives in Schools. Reviews of program evaluations show that interventions designed to&#xD;
      promote young people's cognitive, behavioral, emotional and social development can&#xD;
      successfully enhance skills associated with mental wellbeing (Browne, 2004; Keleher &amp;&#xD;
      Armstrong, 2005; Ball, 2010). There are several examples on mental skills training, such as&#xD;
      the Friends programme, which has shown positive findings (Barrett, Farrell, Ollendick., &amp;&#xD;
      Dadds, 2006), along with the online CBT-programme MoodGym (Calear, Christensen, Mackinnon,&#xD;
      Griffiths., &amp; O'Kearney, 2009). However, most of the mental skills programs address&#xD;
      adolescents with symptoms of anxiety and depression, or at risk of developing mental&#xD;
      illnesses (e.g. Arnarson &amp; Craighead, 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several mental health progammes have been evaluated in Norwegian schools; e.g. &quot;Alle har en&#xD;
      psykisk helse&quot;, &quot;Zippys venner&quot;, &quot;Ungdom møter ungdom (STEP)&quot;, &quot;Venn1.no&quot; (Aune &amp; Stiles,&#xD;
      2009; Andersson et al., 2009; Arnesen, Breivik, Johnsen; 2005; Mishara, Ystgaad, 2006).&#xD;
      However, these programmes are aimed mainly at teaching children about general mental health,&#xD;
      not at teaching mental health skills universally in the classroom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why universal dissemination? Adolescent Coping with Depression Course (ACDC) has previously&#xD;
      been tested on adolescents at risk for depression in a clinical setting, with positive&#xD;
      effects (Garvik, Idsoe &amp; Bru, 2013). However, as the prevention guru Geoffrey Rose stated:&#xD;
      &quot;If disease risk is widespread, measures that decrease risk for everyone are more effective&#xD;
      in reducing the burden of disease than a 'high-risk' approach, in which measures are targeted&#xD;
      only to those individuals with a substantially increased risk for disease.&quot; Because: &quot;If&#xD;
      disease rates rise continuously with higher levels of exposure to the risk factor, the larger&#xD;
      number of people with a small elevation in risk will usually contribute more disease cases to&#xD;
      the total burden of disease than the smaller number of people exposed to a high risk&quot; (Rose,&#xD;
      2008). Rose's prevention paradigm has been proven valid on physical health by Mackenbach et&#xD;
      al. (2012) and promising on mental health by Brugha et al. (2011). Neither CWD or ACDC have&#xD;
      ever been tested on a non-clinical classroom sample aimed at health promotion. Because&#xD;
      depression among young people is widespread, the researchers expect Rose's paradigm also to&#xD;
      be valid on adolescent common mental disorder and disseminate MTE universally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive behaviour theory (CBT). &quot;Mental Techniques in Every-day life (MTE)&quot; is an adaption&#xD;
      of the &quot;Adolescent Coping with Depression Course (ACDC) &quot; (Børve, 2012). ACDC has changed&#xD;
      name to MTE to capture the target group. ACDC is mainly based on Cognitive Behavior Theory&#xD;
      (CBT). The techniques that individuals are taught in CBT are acknowledged as one of the most&#xD;
      efficient interventions for preventing and reducing depression (Clarke et al., 1995; Cuijpers&#xD;
      et al., 2009). CBT delivered as group-therapy is effective in reducing major depression&#xD;
      (Rohde et al., 2004; Rosselló, Bernal, &amp; Rivera-Medina, 2012). The intention is to modify&#xD;
      dysfunctional thinking and behaviour, since these aspects are regarded as one of the main&#xD;
      causes of depression. A depressed individual is characterised as a person who has a negative&#xD;
      internal dialog that maintains negative experiences and beliefs (Weersing, Rozenman, &amp;&#xD;
      Gonzalez, 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD. Sample All first-year students in nine public high schools in the region of &quot;Østfold&#xD;
      fylkeskommune&quot;, and one school in &quot;Akershus fylkeskommune&quot; are implementing MTE in their&#xD;
      ordinary school schedule. The principals for each school have choosen which classes that will&#xD;
      attend in the study. The students in these classes are invited to attend the research project&#xD;
      and respond to questionnaires. It is voluntary to respond. The target group is 16 and 17&#xD;
      years old students, irrespective of school achievements and internalizing problems. The&#xD;
      sample consists of approximately 110 high school classes (2200 students). The classes will be&#xD;
      randomly divided into two groups (see &quot;Design&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention. The program teaches students how to reflect about situations and their&#xD;
      thinking-style, identify their own reaction-patterns to stressful events, to predict and&#xD;
      influence their reactions, and to integrate this understanding and these skills into&#xD;
      practice. Examples of themes are: how emotions emerge, how thoughts and actions influence&#xD;
      feelings, how to change perspectives, coping techniques and how to do exercises in these&#xD;
      methods. It combines interventions from Ellis and Grieger's (1977) Rational Emotive Behaviour&#xD;
      Therapy (REBT) and Beck, Rush, Shaw, and Emery's (1979) cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT). In&#xD;
      addition, MTE has elements from meta-cognition (Wells et al., 2009), positive psychology&#xD;
      (Seligman, 2006), social theories (Bandura, 1977), mindfulness and philosophy, and modern&#xD;
      neurobiological perspectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current project, only teachers will be course leaders and teach the students. In CWD&#xD;
      and ACDC, course leaders have at least three years of relevant higher education; often&#xD;
      nurses, or school-nurses, and psychologist. To be certified, the course leader in MTE, CWD&#xD;
      and ACDC must complete a five-day intensive training program (36 hours). The organization&#xD;
      &quot;Fagakademiet&quot; educates course leaders, and the training is held by a psychologist&#xD;
      specialized in CBT. There are standardized course leader manuals and textbooks. In this&#xD;
      project, approximately 170 teachers will be trained in MTE. The MTE course is once every week&#xD;
      for 90 minutes across eight weeks, and have two booster sessions. After this project, the&#xD;
      teachers will be continuing this work, because the school managements have decided to include&#xD;
      MTE in the ordinary school plan. MTE is not treatment of mental illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers hypotheses that participating in Mind power will increase self-efficacy&#xD;
      (coping), self-esteem, self-control, quality of life and perceptions of their mental health,&#xD;
      and reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. The researchers want to test the effects of&#xD;
      Mind power on school grades and drop-out. Separate analyses will be conducted on the whole&#xD;
      intervention group vs. the control group and on the high-risk group versus the low risk group&#xD;
      (HRG, LRG). The effects on all outcome measures will be examined after 1 year, and there will&#xD;
      be conducted a cost-effectiveness-analysis. If more founding, the data collection will end in&#xD;
      2037 (the researchers have permission from The Norwegian National Research Ethics&#xD;
      Committees). The four main hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mind power enhances school grades, self-efficacy, self-control, self-esteem, mental&#xD;
           well-being and mental health perceptions compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mind power prevents and reduces school dropout, and symptoms of depression and anxiety&#xD;
           compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. More cases of prevented and reduced school dropout, and symptoms of depression and&#xD;
           anxiety are found in the LRG group than in the HRL group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Gain from prevented dropouts and mental distress among LGR and HRG exceed the costs of&#xD;
           Mind power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design. The design is a longitudinal randomized controlled cluster trial, where entire&#xD;
      classes will be randomly divided into two groups. The total sample will be measured when the&#xD;
      first group starts Mind power. The first group starts Mind power immediately, and the second&#xD;
      group starts Mind power after six months (in the next semester). The second group functions&#xD;
      as a control group until beginning Mind power. This delayed intervention design will allow us&#xD;
      to differentiate between a natural increase in the outcome variables and an increase caused&#xD;
      by Mind power, in addition to comparing two Mind power interventions at follow up. The&#xD;
      students respond on questionnaires before the session starts on the first course day, and at&#xD;
      the end of the sessions on the last course day (day 8), when the other group attend the&#xD;
      course, and follow-ups. The students click on a link on iPads or Laptops when responding on&#xD;
      the questionnaires. The design makes us able to compare the two groups, and analyze the&#xD;
      immediate effects of MTE and the long-term effect over at least 1 year (hopefully, there will&#xD;
      be follow-ups until 15 years, if the project receive more founding), and to test Rose's&#xD;
      proposition that a universal strategy is more effective than a high-risk strategy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  10 high Schools have implemented Mind Power in their ordinary scheduals. We include&#xD;
             all the students in these school classes, all the classes that the school principals&#xD;
             have desided can attend in the study. The Principals choose which classes that will&#xD;
             attend in the study, due to the amount of teachers who are able to attend in the&#xD;
             project, and due the fixed time scheduals in their ordinary school plan. Then we&#xD;
             randomize which of these school classes that starts Mind Power first (Group 1) and&#xD;
             which starts six months later (Group 2).&#xD;
