      To characterize the impact of Atrial fibrillation (AFib) and Atrial Flutter (AFl) on signals&#xD;
      measured using a wearable cardiac monitor prototype device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the relationship of AFib/AFl symptom severity with various physiologic signals&#xD;
      measured from the wearable cardiac monitor prototype device.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The is a non-randomized feasibility study that will enroll up to 50 participants with an&#xD;
      ongoing episode of AFib/AFl and are referred for a cardiac ablation or electrical&#xD;
      cardioversion procedure. A maximum of 20 persistent AFib, 20 paroxysmal AFib, and 20 AFl&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled, not to exceed 50 total. There will be up to three data&#xD;
      collection visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 will occur on the same day as enrollment and prior to the cardiac ablation or&#xD;
      electrical cardioversion procedure. This allows collection of physiologic signals while the&#xD;
      patient is in AFib or AFI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 will occur after the cardiac ablation or electrical cardioversion procedure; no&#xD;
      earlier than the day after the cardiac ablation or electrical cardioversion procedure and no&#xD;
      more than 4 months after the day of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 is optional, and may be scheduled upon sponsor's request, which will take place at&#xD;
      least 5 months after the previous (second) data collection visit.&#xD;
