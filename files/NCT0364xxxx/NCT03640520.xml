    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess the impact&#xD;
      of an online skills training module on 1) individual providers' self-rated confidence and&#xD;
      comfort with and current practice of family centered care (FCC) skills; and 2) assess team&#xD;
      performance of FCC and resuscitative care skills during simulated pediatric resuscitation&#xD;
      scenarios.&#xD;

      Context: Each year, more than 30 million children are evaluated at &gt;5,000 US Emergency&#xD;
      Departments (EDs); more than 85% present to general EDs. Pediatric resuscitation is&#xD;
      particularly high-stakes aspect of emergency care for which non-pediatric-specialized EDs are&#xD;
      often unprepared. Evidence shows differential outcomes as well, including a difference in&#xD;
      mortality in pediatric resuscitation between general EDs (40%) and pediatric EDs (22%). The&#xD;
      toll goes beyond physical health outcomes - about 1 in 6 seriously ill children (and their&#xD;
      parents) will go on to have persistent posttraumatic stress symptoms related to their medical&#xD;
      condition and treatment experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is part of a larger project to create and disseminate the &quot;Self-Assessment&#xD;
      through Video Evaluation for Performance improvement in Emergency Department-based Pediatric&#xD;
      Resuscitation&quot; (SAVE PEDS) Toolkit. This web-based resource will enable general emergency&#xD;
      departments (EDs) across the US to reliably self-assess, measure and iteratively improve&#xD;
      their performance in pediatric resuscitation via video review, assessment and debriefing of&#xD;
      simulated or actual patient care emergencies, and accessible training materials. The current&#xD;
      trial will test an online skills training module intended to be delivered as part of SAVE&#xD;
      PEDS. Aimed at healthcare professionals, the Family-centered &amp; Trauma-informed Support in&#xD;
      Pediatric Resuscitation (FACETS: Pediatric Resuscitation) training combines didactic&#xD;
      information and scenario-based learning with opportunities for the learner to practice&#xD;
      applying his/her knowledge at key choice points in realistic pediatric resuscitation&#xD;
      scenarios.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical resuscitation is a high-stakes, fast-moving environment in which a variable team of&#xD;
      health care professionals and ancillary staff must work together seamlessly to maximize&#xD;
      patient outcomes. Pediatric resuscitation is a relatively rare occurrence across all&#xD;
      emergency care, and especially true in the general hospital where providers may have less&#xD;
      comfort and experience with the care of children, and hospitals have fewer pediatric-specific&#xD;
      resources. Yet the general hospital, where 85% of children are seen for emergency care, must&#xD;
      be constantly ready for the resuscitation of a critically ill/injured child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gaps are known to exist in accessibility of pediatric resuscitation equipment, resuscitation&#xD;
      skill performance and guideline adherence. The reported difference in mortality in pediatric&#xD;
      resuscitation between general (40%) and pediatric (22%) EDs may be directly related to these&#xD;
      gaps. Significant gaps also exist in the delivery of family-centered care (FCC) in the ED.&#xD;
      FCC has been defined as care that emphasizes respect for patient and family perspectives&#xD;
      regarding health care, and encouragement of patient and family participation in care and&#xD;
      decision-making. Only half of general EDs report having FCC policies for children. FCC can be&#xD;
      a particular challenge in the resuscitation setting, with many competing priorities for the&#xD;
      medical team's attention and focus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients and families, pediatric resuscitation is an extremely stressful experience.&#xD;
      Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are common in children (and family) in the&#xD;
      aftermath of pediatric critical illness and injury, and these symptoms have been associated&#xD;
      with medication non-adherence, lower quality of life and poorer functional outcomes. There is&#xD;
      strong support for the positive impact of family presence and family involvement in care /&#xD;
      decision-making - on patient safety, patient and family satisfaction, and child and family&#xD;
      emotional health. Meaningful implementation of FCC during resuscitation requires a set of&#xD;
      skills for which few ED providers have had systematic training. Providers in general EDs have&#xD;
      even fewer opportunities to learn or practice these skills as they relate to pediatric&#xD;
      resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: this is a multi-site RCT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting/Participants include a total of 6-8 general EDs - in community or&#xD;
      non-pediatric-specialized hospitals - will participate. Within each ED, Investigators will&#xD;
      enroll individual health care professionals who are involved in pediatric resuscitation in&#xD;
      the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Interventions and Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will gather information on site level factors relative to hospital resources&#xD;
      and ED volumes to categorize and describe EDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete demographics and pre-survey assessing self-rated confidence and&#xD;
      practice of FCC and pediatric resuscitation. 2-3 teams at each site will then participate in&#xD;
      two simulated pediatric resuscitation scenarios incorporating family presence. At&#xD;
      Intervention group sites, participants will then complete the online FCC training. At Control&#xD;
      group sites, participants will complete an online training on national pediatric readiness&#xD;
      standards for EDs. Teams will then complete two additional simulated scenarios, after which a&#xD;
      debriefing session will be held. Participants not present for the simulation sessions will&#xD;
      complete the intervention or control training online. Afterwards, participants will complete&#xD;
      a post-survey assessing self-rated confidence and practice of FCC and pediatric&#xD;
      resuscitation. Four to twelve weeks post-training, teams at each site will participate in two&#xD;
      additional simulation scenarios incorporating family presence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted in general ED settings, to evaluate&#xD;
      the impact of the FACETS: Pediatric Resuscitation training module on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. individual providers' confidence and use of FCC skills in pediatric resuscitation&#xD;
           (primary objective)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. team performance of FCC and resuscitative care skills during simulated pediatric&#xD;
           resuscitations (secondary objective).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will conduct an RCT of the FACETS online training module (intervention) vs. an&#xD;
      online training module reviewing pediatric readiness standards for all EDs (control) in six&#xD;
      to eight participating institutions that are general non-pediatric-specialized EDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization of the participating EDs will occur at the site level, with half allocated to&#xD;
      the intervention condition and half to the control condition. All participants will be&#xD;
      blinded as to treatment condition and as to the specific study goal of evaluating FCC. Study&#xD;
      staff who rate team performance from videotaped simulated pediatric resuscitations will be&#xD;
      blinded as to study condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within each institution, Investigators will enroll individual health care professionals who&#xD;
      are involved in pediatric resuscitation in the ED. An email invitation to all eligible staff&#xD;
      will include a link to study consent and to the study pre-survey, both administered via&#xD;
      REDCap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will complete the pre-training survey, either the intervention or the&#xD;
      control training module, and the post-training survey. A subset of participants (based on&#xD;
      availability) will additionally take part in in situ simulated pediatric resuscitation&#xD;
      scenarios, as part of a team, at their institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Baseline Visit (online) A. Online survey (REDCap), up to 4 weeks prior to training,&#xD;
      online questionnaires - self-report by individual providers. Time: 20-30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Visit B. In situ simulations, team of providers participates in 2 simulated&#xD;
      pediatric resuscitation scenarios conducted in ED. Time: 1 - 1.5 hours C. Online training&#xD;
      module (intervention or control), individual providers will complete independently, a subset&#xD;
      of participants present for in situ study visit will complete online training module&#xD;
      individually between simulation sessions. Those not present for in situ study visit will&#xD;
      complete online training module on their own. Time: 1 hour D. Post training in situ&#xD;
      simulations, team of providers participates in 2 simulated pediatric resuscitation scenarios&#xD;
      conducted in ED. Time: 1 - 1.5 hours Follow-up Phase (online) E. Online survey (REDCap), up&#xD;
      to 6 weeks after online training module, online questionnaires - self-report by individual&#xD;
      providers. Time: 20-30 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is at the provider level: pre- to post-training changes in individual&#xD;
      providers' self-rated confidence in providing FCC in pediatric resuscitation. Investigators&#xD;
      will also examine pre- to post-training changes in self-reported use of FCC skills in&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoint is at the site level: pre- to post-training changes in team&#xD;
      performance of FCC, as measured by the presence and quality of family-centered care behaviors&#xD;
      exhibited during video-recorded simulated pediatric resuscitation scenarios. Team performance&#xD;
      measures of technical and non-technical resuscitative care skills will also be examined as a&#xD;
      balancing measure to this endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Power Investigators will attempt to enroll all available providers meeting&#xD;
      inclusion criteria at each participating ED, and estimate that approximately 300 individual&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled, averaging 40-50 participants from each general ED site. Power&#xD;
      analysis is based on our analyses for the primary endpoint. A sample size of 300 individuals&#xD;
      (~150 per group) provides 80% power to detect a between-group effect size as small as .24&#xD;
      between groups in post-training scores, using ANCOVA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy Analyses To evaluate the primary outcome, Investigators will examine scores on&#xD;
      self-report surveys completed by participants before and after training. Investigators will&#xD;
      calculate pre- to post-training change scores for individual providers, and summarize these&#xD;
      for the total sample and by treatment group. Investigators will examine training effects on&#xD;
      participant outcomes (self-rated confidence in providing FCC) by means of analysis of&#xD;
      covariance (ANCOVA). In each ANCOVA, study condition will be the grouping factor and the&#xD;
      corresponding pre-training score for the outcome measure will be included as a covariate.&#xD;
      ANCOVA allows us to examine the potential impact of key co-variates that may vary by group&#xD;
      despite random assignment to condition. Investigators will also estimate effect sizes for&#xD;
      each group for pre- to post-training change in self-rated confidence in FCC skills.&#xD;
      Investigators will then conduct parallel analyses for pre- to post-training changes in&#xD;
      self-rated use and intentions to use FCC skills in practice with pediatric patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the secondary outcome, Investigators will rate team performance based on review&#xD;
      of video-recorded simulated pediatric resuscitations conducted before and after training.&#xD;
      Investigators will calculate each participating site's pre- to post-intervention change in&#xD;
      global ratings for each domain in specific aspect of FCC performance (FCC Assessment Tool),&#xD;
      averaged across simulations and teams at that site. Investigators will also assess pre- to&#xD;
      post-training changes in patient/scenario-specific resuscitative care (e.g., time to&#xD;
      important interventions, success in interventions, guideline-consistent care) and in team&#xD;
      performance (i.e. crew resource management, or CRM) using validated team performance measures&#xD;
      (CPT and BAT). This balancing measure will allow investigators to confirm that any observed&#xD;
      improvements in FCC do not come at the cost of poorer medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional analyses To better understand training effects, Investigators will conduct&#xD;
      exploratory subgroup analyses within high- and low-resource ED settings. Investigators will&#xD;
      also conduct exploratory analyses to understand the potential impact of participation in&#xD;
      simulated practice on clinicians' technical and non-technical resuscitation skills.&#xD;
      Investigators will describe baseline and follow-up scores on confidence measures in these&#xD;
      areas, and examine pre- to post changes for the subset of participants who take part in the&#xD;
      simulation scenarios.&#xD;
