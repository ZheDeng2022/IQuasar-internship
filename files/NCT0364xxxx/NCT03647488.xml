  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of capmatinib in&#xD;
      combination with spartalizumab in adult participants with epidermal growth factor receptor&#xD;
      (EGFR) wild type (for exon 19 deletions and exon 21 L858R substitution mutations), anaplastic&#xD;
      lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement negative in locally advanced (stage IIIB, not eligible&#xD;
      for definitive chemo-radiation) or metastatic (stage IV) Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)&#xD;
      after failure of platinum doublet and checkpoint inhibitor treatment.&#xD;

      This was a two-part prospectively designed, multicenter, open-label, randomized phase II&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: Run-in. Prior to the randomized part of the study, a run-in to assess the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability as well as preliminary efficacy of the capmatinib and spartalizumab combination&#xD;
      was conducted. Participants were treated with capmatinib 400 mg twice daily (BID) and&#xD;
      spartalizumab 400 mg intravenously (i.v.) once every 28 days. A review was planned to take&#xD;
      place after all participants had at least 24 weeks of follow-up. The decision to expand the&#xD;
      study to the randomized part was to be based on the safety, tolerability, and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of the capmatinib and spartalizumab combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Randomized. Subjects were planned to be randomized to one of the following arms in a&#xD;
      2:1 ratio: 1) combination of capmatinib 400 mg BID and spartalizumab 400 mg i.v. once every&#xD;
      28 days; 2) docetaxel 75 mg/m2 i.v. following local guidelines as per standard of care and&#xD;
      product labels. Based on the results obtained in the run-in part of the study, the randomized&#xD;
      part was not opened.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the run-in part of the study, the treatment period began on Cycle 1 Day 1 and continued&#xD;
      in 28-day cycles until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of informed&#xD;
      consent, pregnancy, lost to follow-up, or death irrespective of start of new anti-neoplastic&#xD;
      therapy. After treatment discontinuation, all subjects were followed for safety evaluations&#xD;
      during the safety follow-up period, and the subject's status was collected every 8 weeks as&#xD;
      part of the survival follow-up&#xD;

An adequate tumour assessment is a tumour assessment with an overall response other than unknown.&#xD;
Progression is defined using RECIST 1.1 and as per investigator assessment as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameter of all measured target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameter of all target lesions recorded at or after baseline.

    <description>DOR is the time between the date of first documented response(CR or PR) and the date of first documented progression or death due to underlying cancer based on RECIST1.1 and as per investigator assessment. If progression or death has not occurred, the subject is censored at the date of last adequate tumor assessment. CR: Disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions and any pathological lymph nodes assigned as target lesions must have a reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameter of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters.

CR: Disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions. In addition, any pathological lymph nodes assigned as target lesions must have a reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 mm.&#xD;
PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameter of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters.&#xD;

        <description>PFS is defined as the time from the date of start of treatment to the date of the first documented radiological progression or death due to any cause. For participants who had not progressed or died at the analysis cut-off date, PFS was censored at the date of the last adequate tumor evaluation date. An adequate tumour assessment is a tumour assessment with an overall response other than unknown.&#xD;
Progression is defined using RECIST 1.1 and as per investigator assessment as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameter of all measured target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameter of all target lesions recorded at or after baseline. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.&#xD;
