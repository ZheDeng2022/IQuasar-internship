  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A novel and promising therapy for cognitive dysfunction is non-invasive brain stimulation, of&#xD;
      which transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a form. TMS is currently FDA-approved for&#xD;
      use in depression and migraine. It is under investigation for use in a number of other&#xD;
      neurologic and psychiatric disorders. In addition to its potential to improve affective&#xD;
      symptoms, recent research has suggested that TMS targeted to select cortical regions can also&#xD;
      improve cognition. In trials of TMS therapy for psychiatric disorders, several studies have&#xD;
      shown benefits for cognitive function alongside symptom amelioration. In healthy persons, a&#xD;
      course of stimulation of the parietal area improved objective measures of learning and&#xD;
      memory. Among persons with TBI, there have been case reports supporting improvement in&#xD;
      cognitive function and postconcussive symptoms; however, there have not yet been any&#xD;
      controlled studies of TMS for TBI-related cognitive dysfunction.&#xD;

      Subjects with a history of TBI will be recruited into this double-blind, sham controlled,&#xD;
      crossover with washout study design. Study will involve one week (5 consecutive days) of&#xD;
      treatment, a 7 day off period, followed by a second week of rTMS treatment. Motor threshold&#xD;
      will determine level of stimulation, and active rTMS stimulation will occur of the right&#xD;
      DLPFC. Subjects will be paid for their time.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects receive rTMS over the right DLPFC, in 2 second bursts at 10 Hz, followed by a 19 second break, for a total of 20 minutes. Stimulator intensity is set to 80% of motor threshold on day one, and 100% of motor threshold for the remainder of intervention. This paradigm is continued for 5 consecutive days.</description>

    <description>Identical to active arm, but stimulator intensity is reduced to 30% of motor threshold, and the stimulator coil is oriented tangentially to the skull to &quot;stimulate&quot; air space above the head instead of cortical tissue.</description>
