  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of an evidence-based smartphone&#xD;
      application (app) for the management of mood compared to treatment as usual alone among 135&#xD;
      women who have been discharged post-delivery from Labor and Delivery at Stanford Children's&#xD;
      Health - Lucile Packard Children's Hospital. Using psychometrically validated surveys for&#xD;
      depression, postpartum depression, and anxiety, this study will evaluate whether the&#xD;
      smartphone app has a differential effect on the mental health of postpartum women as compared&#xD;
      to treatment as usual.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention is a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) based automated conversational agent&#xD;
      available as a mobile device smartphone application. When a user logs in with the app, it&#xD;
      asks questions about that user, such as how they're feeling, and the user is able to type&#xD;
      their response, similar to texting or messaging. The app is then available for use by the&#xD;
      user anytime (24 hours per day 7 days per week), and will check in with the user to encourage&#xD;
      mood tracking followed by tailored delivery of CBT-based tools and other general&#xD;
      psychoeducation. This smartphone app interacts with conversational tones, and offers empathy&#xD;
      and behavioral pattern insight to users. The app's artificial intelligence becomes more&#xD;
      specific to a user over time, based on conversations. The app allows patients are able to&#xD;
      immediately process and receive empathy for significant events and removes barriers&#xD;
      traditionally limiting treatment access (cost, stigma, health care system navigability, and&#xD;
      lack of childcare or transportation).&#xD;

    <description>PHQ-9 will be used to assess depression. The maximum score is 27. The scale is interpreted as follows: 0-4 no depression, 5-9 mild, 10-14 moderate, 15-19 moderately severe, 20-27 severe.</description>

    <description>The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is a 10-item self-report used to measure postpartum depression (range 0-30, higher score indicates greater symptom burden). A score of &gt;9 is indicative of perinatal major depression.</description>
