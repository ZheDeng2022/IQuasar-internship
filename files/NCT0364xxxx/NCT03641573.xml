  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase 1, open-label, nonrandomized, single-dose study in healthy male&#xD;
      subjects. Subjects will be admitted into the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) on Day 1 and be&#xD;
      confined to the CRU until at least Day 7. On Day 1, subjects will receive a single oral dose&#xD;
      of [14C] ASN002 at 60 mg containing approximately 300 μCi [14C] ASN002. Subjects will be&#xD;
      discharged on Day 7 if the following discharge criteria are met: plasma radioactivity levels&#xD;
      below the limit of quantitation for 2 consecutive collections, and ≥90% mass balance&#xD;
      recovery, or ≤1% of the total radioactive dose is recovered in combined excreta (urine and&#xD;
      feces) in 3 consecutive 24 hour periods. If discharge criteria are not met by Day 7, subjects&#xD;
      will remain in the CRU up to a maximum of Day 10.&#xD;
