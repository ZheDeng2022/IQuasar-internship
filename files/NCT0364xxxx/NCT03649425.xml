  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is a prospective non-randomized and comparative study of patients&#xD;
      undergoing surgical treatment with external fixators of any type, between May 2018 and May&#xD;
      2020, in the city of Passo Fundo, RS, Brazil, in the São Vicente de Paulo hospitals. A study&#xD;
      in which we compared infection rates, pin loosening and complications found in external&#xD;
      fixators made with hydroxyapatite coated pins and uncoated steel pins.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will use as a guide to define the degree of infection and the conduct to be taken in the&#xD;
      classification of Mas Oxford Nuffield (Table 3), therefore the presence of infection&#xD;
      occurring in patients classified as Grade 2 - erythema of the skin, serous or purulent&#xD;
      secretion, pain and sensitivity in soft tissues capable of mobilizing with analgesia. We will&#xD;
      also send to the culture the tip of two pins removed from each patient to evaluate possible&#xD;
      colonization and to compare with the degree of classification presented in the pin in&#xD;
      question, we will do this with a pin without signal of infection and with the pin with the&#xD;
      highest degree of classification presented in each patient at the time of the external&#xD;
      fixator removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use as a method of insertion of the pin the pre-perforation irrigated before the&#xD;
      insertion of the pins, to decrease the chances of thermal necrosis and consequent release or&#xD;
      infection. We will use steel Shanz pins coated with hydroxyapatite or not in size between&#xD;
      5-6mm. Comorbidities and risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, smoking, immunodepression,&#xD;
      among others, will be computed for later comparison with the data collected. The degree of&#xD;
      classification of the fractures, as well as the pathologies that were treated with the&#xD;
      fixators, as well as the residence time with the external fixator will also be computed for&#xD;
      later comparison with the data collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the elaboration of this study, the patients will be prospectively observed, which will be&#xD;
      submitted to the treatment of several pathologies with external fixators, of any type. The&#xD;
      occurrence of infection and / or loosening of the pins, as well as the influence of risk&#xD;
      factors and the cultural examination results of the pins removed at the end of the treatment&#xD;
      will be recorded. The objectives of the study are to comparatively evaluate the differences&#xD;
      in complications of infection, pin loosening and microbiological results of cultural&#xD;
      examinations, between patients submitted to external fixators with uncoated steel pins and&#xD;
      steel pins coated with hydroxyapatite. The influence of risk factors on outcomes will also be&#xD;
      observed.&#xD;
