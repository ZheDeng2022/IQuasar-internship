  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study to understand how environmental and genetic factors may be&#xD;
      involved in lung function. Healthy Study participants will undergo a 1-day screening that&#xD;
      includes a blood draw and breathing testing, return for a two-day series of testing to&#xD;
      include blood draw, and brief breathing test before and after an inhaled challenge with&#xD;
      either filtered air (FA) or ozone (O3). Participants return the next day for a brief&#xD;
      breathing test, a blood draw and a procedure called bronchoscopy performed under conscious&#xD;
      sedation to evaluate the lung after the challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants then return 18 - 20 days later to repeat the two-day series of testing to be&#xD;
      challenged with the exposure not received on the first series, (FA or O3). Each visit will&#xD;
      take about 3 - 3.5 hours. Follow-up phone calls from the study team will occur at 24 hours&#xD;
      after each 2-day test series. Total study duration is about one to one-and a half months.&#xD;

      In brief, at V1 subjects will be assessed for baseline spirometry and venous blood analysis&#xD;
      prior to exposure. The venous blood will be used to obtain PMNs for apoptosis assays, and&#xD;
      serum for CFH and sCD163 levels. Additionally, this will be used to measure cytokines and&#xD;
      growth factors. At each visit, if the subject is female, there will be a urine pregnancy test&#xD;
      performed. Following this initial assessment, subjects will be challenged with FA or O3 and&#xD;
      then spirometry will be performed, and venous blood will be obtained immediately following&#xD;
      the exposure (V2). The subjects will then return 20 hours ±4h later for follow up studies&#xD;
      (V3). There will be spirometry, a venous blood draw and urine pregnancy testing (if female)&#xD;
      followed by bronchoscopy. At bronchoscopy, vital signs will be determined, including O2 sat.&#xD;
      Patient then undergo an 18-20 day washout period before they are brought back in for V4 for&#xD;
      the alternate challenge. This will follow the same protocol as outline above in the initial&#xD;
      exposure and use the same series of analysis as the first set of visits. Therefore, we will&#xD;
      fully characterize the biological response to ozone and filtered air in these same subjects.&#xD;
