      The phase 2 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of bortezomib in combination with&#xD;
      lenalidomide as maintenance therapy in high risk newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients&#xD;
      who receive lenalidomide,bortezomib, and dexamethasone Combination as induction therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of front-line therapy for multiple myeloma (MM) is to substantially decrease tumor&#xD;
      burden, either in preparation for consolidation with high-dose melphalan therapy with&#xD;
      autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) or as a means in itself to provide long-term&#xD;
      disease control. The degree of disease reduction is associated with improved outcome,&#xD;
      including prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS),both after&#xD;
      preparation for or after consolidation with ASCT,and in patients not proceeding to ASCT.The&#xD;
      introduction of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and the immunomodulatory drugs&#xD;
      thalidomide and lenalidomide has been associated with improved survival. Combinations of&#xD;
      bortezomib or lenalidomide with conventional anti-MM drugs have demonstrated very high&#xD;
      overall response rates and quality of response in the front-line setting, as reviewed&#xD;
      recently.The phase 2 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of bortezomib in combination&#xD;
      with lenalidomide as maintenance therapy in high risk newly diagnosed multiple myeloma&#xD;
      patients who receive lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone(VRD) Combination as&#xD;
      induction therapy.The investigators gave patients subcutaneous bortezomib on days 1, 8,15,&#xD;
      and 22; oral lenalidomide on days 1 to 21; and oral dexamethasone on days 1, 8, 15 and 12 of&#xD;
      a 28-day cycle.Patients are allowed to interrupt therapy for collection of stem cells at any&#xD;
      time after three cycles of induction, and to proceed to stem-cell transplantation after four&#xD;
      cycles of induction at the discretion of the treating physician.Two months after hematologic&#xD;
      recovery, nonprogressive patients are to receive consolidation therapy comprising two 4-week&#xD;
      cycles of VRD or the second autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (determined by&#xD;
      the attending physician according to the patient's physical condition, willingness and the&#xD;
      number of CD34 + cells collected).Patients who do not proceed to stem-cell transplantation&#xD;
      receive a total of 12 courses of VRD induction therapy(dexamethasone dosage will be reduced&#xD;
      to 20mg from the 9th course of treatment). Responding patients could receive maintenance&#xD;
      therapy comprising 4-week cycles of bortezomib on days 1 and 15 at the dose level of 1.3mg/m2&#xD;
      and lenalidomide on days 1 to 21 at the dose level of 10mg.Participants discontinued&#xD;
      treatment if participants had progressive disease or unacceptable toxic eff ects not&#xD;
      controlled with dose modifications.&#xD;
