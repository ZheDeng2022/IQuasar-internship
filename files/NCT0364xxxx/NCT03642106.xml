  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent alcohol tobacco and drug (ATOD) use is a major public health concern, with rates&#xD;
      for Latino middle school youth higher than other ethnic groups. One well-established&#xD;
      precursor of adolescent ATOD use is psychosocial stress. The proposed project examines the&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of Unidos to decrease ATOD use among Latino youth in new settlement&#xD;
      areas. The goals of this efficacy trial will be achieved by accomplishing two specific aims:&#xD;
      (1) Evaluate the potential of the intervention to delay the initiation into or reduce ATOD&#xD;
      use among Latino youth who are 1st to 2nd generation immigrants; and (2) Evaluate the&#xD;
      intervention's ability to strengthen known protective factors against ATOD use among&#xD;
      adolescents-specifically child personal agency and parent-child, peer, and school&#xD;
      relationships.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study's primary hypothesis is: The Unidos Se Puede program will delay initiation of ATOD&#xD;
      use of current non-users and reduce use among current users.&#xD;

      Adolescent alcohol tobacco and drug (ATOD) use is a major public health concern, with rates&#xD;
      for Latino middle school youth higher than other ethnic groups. One well-established&#xD;
      precursor of adolescent ATOD use is psychosocial stress. The overall aim of this project is&#xD;
      to test the efficacy of a culturally appropriate psychosocial program to prevent or reduce&#xD;
      ATOD use among Latino immigrant youth. The intervention consists of: (1) encouraging parental&#xD;
      involvement in child schooling, general parenting skills, and coping strategies ; (2)&#xD;
      fostering child social emotional learning (SEL) through assigning a near-peer success coach&#xD;
      to help develop critical thinking, problem solving, and goal setting skills; and (3)&#xD;
      promoting positive peer affiliations through participation in regular activities that&#xD;
      facilitate bonding to prosocial institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) Evaluate the potential of the intervention to delay the initiation into or reduce ATOD&#xD;
      use among Latino youth who are 1st to 2nd generation immigrants; and (2) Evaluate the&#xD;
      intervention's ability to strengthen known protective factors against ATOD use among&#xD;
      adolescents-specifically child personal agency and parent-child, peer, and school&#xD;
      relationships.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study's primary hypothesis is: The Unidos Se Puede program will delay initiation of ATOD&#xD;
      use of current non-users and reduce use among current users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To accomplish these aims, we propose an attention placebo randomized control trial. For this&#xD;
      trial, we will recruit a sample of youth and their parents (N=120 dyads) from a random sample&#xD;
      of Latino 6th and 7th grade students in Tulsa Public Schools. Those meeting the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria and agreeing to participate will provide baseline data before&#xD;
      being randomly assigned to either the treatment or control condition (n=60 dyads each).&#xD;
      Participants will be followed for 12 months post-baseline, during which time we will collect&#xD;
      psychosocial measures annually near the end of each school year (May to June). The study will&#xD;
      collect psychosocial measures from parents and youth.&#xD;
