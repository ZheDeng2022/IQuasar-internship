      The CSP-1001 study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the InnAVasc arteriovenous&#xD;
      graft (AVG) when implanted in and used for hemodialysis in participants suffering from end&#xD;
      stage renal failure (ESRD). The InnAVasc AVG is implanted and used similar to other standard&#xD;
      of care dialysis grafts currently on the market. However, the InnAVasc AVG has been uniquely&#xD;
      designed to potentially allow for immediate needle access (same day as implant surgery as&#xD;
      opposed to 2-4 weeks of waiting), to potentially reduce excessive bleeding from the graft&#xD;
      after dialysis, and it may provide protection from improper or missed needle cannulation&#xD;
      attempts.&#xD;

      The CSP-1001 study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the InnAVasc arteriovenous&#xD;
      graft (AVG) when implanted in and used for hemodialysis in participants suffering from end&#xD;
      stage renal failure (ESRD). The InnAVasc AVG is implanted and used similar to other standard&#xD;
      of care dialysis grafts currently on the market. However, the InnAVasc AVG has been uniquely&#xD;
      designed to potentially allow for immediate needle access (same day as implant surgery as&#xD;
      opposed to 2-4 weeks of waiting), to potentially reduce excessive bleeding from the graft&#xD;
      after dialysis, and it may provide protection from improper or missed needle cannulation&#xD;
      attempts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical investigation is a prospective, multi-center, single arm, non-randomized study.&#xD;
      Participants with ESRD who require hemodialysis and are suitable for an AVG for hemodialysis&#xD;
      access will be eligible for inclusion in the study. Suitable participants will be implanted&#xD;
      with an InnAVasc AVG in the forearm or upper arm using standard vascular surgical techniques.&#xD;
      The graft will be placed in a &quot;straight&quot; (soft &quot;C&quot;) configuration in the upper arm, or looped&#xD;
      configuration in the forearm (forearm loop) or upper arm (axillary loop). Twenty-six (26)&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled to be implanted with the InnAVasc AVG from up to 7&#xD;
      investigational sites in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary effectiveness endpoint of secondary graft patency will be assessed at 6 months&#xD;
      but the total study duration is 24 months. The primary safety endpoint will include&#xD;
      characterization of dialysis graft adverse events over 6 months. It is hypothesized that the&#xD;
      InnAVasc AVG will provide a secondary patency rate similar to the current standard of care&#xD;
      dialysis access grafts on the market, but will have the potential to reduce needle&#xD;
      cannulation-related adverse events and complications.&#xD;
