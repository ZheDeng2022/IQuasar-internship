    <textblock>
      Since decades, neurosurgeons and neurooncologists assumed that the mass effect of brain&#xD;
      tumors with peritumoral edema or intratumoral hemorrhage might lead to increased ICP.&#xD;
      Therefore, decisions on surgical procedures and medical treatments were made based on&#xD;
      clinical and radiological findings suggesting increased ICP. But in fact, no measurement has&#xD;
      ever confirmed increased ICP in brain tumor patients. From an ethical point of view, it is&#xD;
      not justifiable to implant an intraparenchymal ICP probe within an invasive surgical&#xD;
      procedure in a brain tumor patient unless the patient is comatose or present with rapid&#xD;
      impairment of the level of consciousness. Therefore, with the new medical device for&#xD;
      non-invasive ICP measurement presented in this study protocol, we will be able to measure&#xD;
      absolute ICP values in patients with brain tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary brain tumors in adults are less common than metastatic tumors. The most frequent are&#xD;
      glioblastoma multiforme, metastases, anaplastic astrocytoma, meningioma, pituitary tumors and&#xD;
      vestibular schwannoma. 70% of the tumors in adults are supratentorial. The most&#xD;
      infratentorial tumors are metastases, schwannoma, meningioma, epidermoid, hemangioblastoma,&#xD;
      and brainstem glioma. Causes of brain tumors are genetics, radiation, immunosuppression,&#xD;
      viruses and chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically patients present with neurological deficits as hemiparesis, cranial nerve&#xD;
      deficiency or signs of raised ICP such as headache, nausea, vomitus, vigilance disturbance.&#xD;
      After clinical assessment, standard MRI with contrast agent is performed to visualize the&#xD;
      size and structure of the tumor, contrast uptake, peritumoral edema (PTE), and other&#xD;
      radiological findings. Depending on the tumor, size and location, the further procedure must&#xD;
      be defined with either surgical resection, observation, other adjuvant therapies. Mostly, a&#xD;
      histological diagnosis is needed to know the tumor biology and set supplementary treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with brain tumors with mass effect and peritumoral edema with consecutive midline&#xD;
      shift increased intracranial pressure (ICP) is usually considered. During the expansion of an&#xD;
      intracranial mass lesion, there is initially a minimal increase in ICP, but as compensatory&#xD;
      capacity is exhausted the volume pressure curve rapidly steepens, and by further expansion of&#xD;
      the mass a distinct increase in ICP results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supratentorial tumors can produce significant mass effect in the brain. In certain tumor&#xD;
      types, especially metastases, high grade gliomas, and meningeomas significant peritumoral&#xD;
      edema that lead to elevation of intracranial pressure might be associated. In cases of&#xD;
      infratentorial tumors with or without edema earlier clinical decompensation with&#xD;
      hydrocephalus, increased ICP and downward herniation are more often due to reduced space&#xD;
      within the posterior fossa. Within the closed bony cranium, increase of volume, such as tumor&#xD;
      with associated edema or hemorrhage, ischemia, occlusion of venous perfusion or hydrocephalus&#xD;
      lead to an increase of ICP and secondary injury to the normal brain. PTE is caused by&#xD;
      vasogenic edema in particular, but also cytotoxic edema, tumor-related-pressure, arterial&#xD;
      blood supply, venous congestion and secretion of angiogenic factors such as vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF, Aquaporin-4 (AQP4), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX- 2), and&#xD;
      nitric oxide (NO) induce dysfunction of tight junction proteins playing an important role in&#xD;
      the formation of edema. Cerebral edema induced by brain tumor is characterized by an increase&#xD;
      in the permeability of brain capillary endothelial cells and an increase in the brain water&#xD;
      content. Peritumoral vasogenic edema as a result of blood-brain-barrier dysfunction within&#xD;
      the tumor affects neurological function and quality of life, and may even cause&#xD;
      life-threatening raised intracranial pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the carbon dioxide (CO2) reactivity, are known to be reduced in&#xD;
      patients with brain tumor, especially those with pronounced signs of intracranial&#xD;
      hypertension.The study reported by Chang et al. showed, that the mean CBF of both hemispheres&#xD;
      in each group was not significantly different from brain tumor patients with peritumoral&#xD;
      edema to age-matched controls. Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) was preserved in patients&#xD;
      with mild peritumoral edema but was significantly reduced in patients with moderate and&#xD;
      severe peritumoral edema. Surgical removal of the tumor significantly improved the impaired&#xD;
      CVR, although the mean CBF did not change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An earlier study on measurements of intratumoral and peritumoral blood flow as well as within&#xD;
      the hemispheres indicated, very low flow values in the peritumoral edematous area. These&#xD;
      findings suggest that the hypodense area surrounding brain tumor may actually represent tumor&#xD;
      pressure ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Certain risk factors for increased edema, such as age, sex, tumor size, neurological&#xD;
      symptoms, seizures, location, histology, and contrast enhancement, have been identified. The&#xD;
      extend of PTE has been demonstrated as a predictor of favorable overall survival time in&#xD;
      patients with larger PTE in metastases, but on the contrary smaller PTE was a statistically&#xD;
      significant predictor of longer survival in high-grade gliomas. On the other hand it has been&#xD;
      shown, that postoperative complications were more frequent and duration of intensive care&#xD;
      treatment was longer in patients with PTE. Outcome was significantly better in patients&#xD;
      without PTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Steroids are in use since 1960's and play a substantial role in the management of brain tumor&#xD;
      and increased ICP associated with perilesional edema. Vasogenic edema responds very well to&#xD;
      corticosteroids, although they have important side effects. Corticosteroids should be used in&#xD;
      a low dose daily to avoid serious side effects such as myopathy, diabetes, hypertonia,&#xD;
      osteoporosis, psychiatric alterations, skin thinning and an increased risk for some&#xD;
      opportunistic infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study of Skjoeth et al., brain tumor patients with a substantial amount of edema were&#xD;
      included. The effect of steroids was monitored during 5 days by clinical examination and&#xD;
      epidural ICP measurement. ICP reduction was found only in 4 of 13 patients, another 4&#xD;
      patients with meningioma had a significant increase of ICP and none of them experienced&#xD;
      clinical improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebral swelling through the craniotomy can seriously threaten surgical access and increase&#xD;
      the risk of cerebral ischemia with potential worsening of outcome. Rasmussen et al. observed&#xD;
      that subdural ICP is the strongest predictor of intraoperative brain swelling. In addition&#xD;
      midline shift, diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme and metastasis were significant risk&#xD;
      factors of intraoperative brain swelling. With an intraoperative ICP greater than 13 mmHg,&#xD;
      supra- and infratentorial brain swelling occurred with 95% probability and at an ICP greater&#xD;
      than 26 mmHg, severe brain swelling occurred with 95% probability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cold et al. reported subdural ICP measurements in 29 patients during supra- and&#xD;
      infratentorial craniotomies. The authors observed, that at subdural ICP &lt; 6 mmHg&#xD;
      intraoperative brain herniation never occurred. Patients with a subdural ICP greater than 7&#xD;
      mmHg some brain herniation was documented in all cases, and if subdural ICP was greater than&#xD;
      11 mmHg, pronounced brain swelling/herniation occurred in all patients. In a follow-up study,&#xD;
      including patients receiving supratentorial craniotomy cerebral herniation did not occur at&#xD;
      subdural ICP &lt; 7 mmHg. On the other hand, at ICP &gt;10 mmHg cerebral herniation occurred with&#xD;
      high probability. These thresholds were independent of anesthetic agent used and the level of&#xD;
      partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2). Jorgensen et al. reported results of posterior&#xD;
      fossa craniotomies where at an ICP &lt; 10 mmHg, brain swelling/herniation rarely occurred,&#xD;
      while at ICP ≥10 mmHg some degree of brain swelling/herniation was always present.&#xD;
      Interestingly neurosurgeons' tactile estimation of dural tension correlated poorly with any&#xD;
      tendency to brain swelling/herniation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peritumoral edema is considered to decrease after surgical resection, but there are cases&#xD;
      where the edema enlarges postoperatively. Ono and other authors presented cases with&#xD;
      postoperative progressive edema. Correlating to this results, it has been proven, that&#xD;
      postoperative sustained ICP elevation occurs and the rise in ICP occurred before any&#xD;
      neurological deterioration was noticed. Similarly, studies showed, that edema increases after&#xD;
      radiotherapy or radiosurgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although it is suspected that intracranial lesion with mass effect might cause increased ICP,&#xD;
      there is no clinical evidence proven yet. Raised ICP can cause clinical manifestations and&#xD;
      symptoms such as headache, nausea, vomiting, and neurological deficits. These signs, which&#xD;
      are known as intracranial hypertension signs, are variable and have not been validated due to&#xD;
      the lack of technological tools to measure ICP non-invasively. To date, only intra- and&#xD;
      postoperative measurements of increased ICP have been shown with intraparenchymal ICP probes&#xD;
      or intraventricular catheters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inspection of the ocular fundus would be an option to detect papilledema as a sign of&#xD;
      intracranial hypertension. Nevertheless, papilledema is considered to have a late onset since&#xD;
      it takes some time to be developed and not all patients with brain tumors present with fundus&#xD;
      abnormalities. Moreover, if the patient has a preexisting condition such as high blood&#xD;
      pressure causing intracranial hypertension and chronic papilledema, it will be difficult to&#xD;
      assess the changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, ICP can be measured and registered only using invasive techniques. The two ICP&#xD;
      measurement methods available - intraventricular and intraparenchymal - require both a&#xD;
      neurosurgical procedure, in order to implant the catheter and probes within the brain&#xD;
      parenchyma and ventricles. Thus, these measures include themselves a risk for the subject.&#xD;
      Infections and intracranial bleedings related to invasive ICP measurement techniques are&#xD;
      considered frequent complications. In addition, invasive recording of ICP requires&#xD;
      neurosurgical expertise and intensive care unit (ICU) facilities. Present review articles&#xD;
      conclude that there is still a lack of non-invasive techniques for accurate measurement of&#xD;
      the ICP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intracranial pressure (ICP) measurement is clinically important in several pathophysiology&#xD;
      conditions. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure is the reference for the &quot;gold standard&quot;&#xD;
      invasive ICP measured via a brain ventriculostomy or by lumbar puncture in patients with free&#xD;
      CSF circulation. Elevated ICP is a critical indication for treatment of patients with acute&#xD;
      neurologic condition, and the best approach to management is considered to be different&#xD;
      depending on the underlying pathophysiology. ICP can only be measured using invasive methods&#xD;
      in routine clinical practice. The most common application of ICP monitoring is in the&#xD;
      management of patients with severe closed head injury or some other neurologic disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concept of non-invasive ICP measurement has been discussed since the 1980s. Numerous&#xD;
      methods for finding the objects or physiological characteristics of cerebrospinal system that&#xD;
      would be related to the ICP and its monitoring have been postulated by many authors. Most of&#xD;
      the proposed technologies were based on ultrasound and were capable of monitoring blood flow&#xD;
      in intracranial or intraocular vessels, cranium diameter, or acoustic properties of the&#xD;
      cranium. Broad research has extended into sonography of optic nerve sheath and its relation&#xD;
      with elevated ICP. However, most of these correlation-based methods had the same problem -&#xD;
      the need of individual patient specific calibration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seeking to measure absolute ICP values, researchers from Kaunas University of Technology&#xD;
      created a non-invasive method, which does not need a patient specific calibration. The method&#xD;
      is based on direct comparison of ICP value with the value of pressure Pe that is externally&#xD;
      applied to the tissues surrounding the eyeball. Intracranial segment of ophthalmic artery&#xD;
      (OA) is used as a natural sensor of ICP and extracranial segment of OA is used as a sensor of&#xD;
      Pe. A special two depth transcranial Doppler (TCD) device is used as a pressure balance&#xD;
      indicator when ICP = Pe. Accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic value&#xD;
      of this method were proven with patients with mild neurological diseases. This device has not&#xD;
      yet been used in clinical studies to investigate ICP in brain tumor patients. A study of our&#xD;
      neurosurgical department to validate the accuracy of non-invasive ICP measurement compared to&#xD;
      invasive measurement techniques is ongoing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since decades, neurosurgeons and neurooncologists assumed, that the mass effect of brain&#xD;
      tumors with peritumoral edema or intratumoral hemorrhage might lead to increased ICP.&#xD;
      Therefore, decisions on surgical procedures and medical treatments were made based on&#xD;
      clinical and radiological findings suggesting increased ICP. But in fact, no measurement has&#xD;
      ever confirmed increased ICP in brain tumor patients. From an ethical point of view, it is&#xD;
      not justifiable to implant an intraparenchymal ICP probe within an invasive surgical&#xD;
      procedure in a brain tumor patient unless the patient is comatose or present with rapid&#xD;
      impairment of the level of consciousness. Therefore, with the new medical device presented in&#xD;
      this study protocol, we will be able to measure absolute ICP values in patients with brain&#xD;
      tumors. The aim of the study is to correlate absolute ICP values with clinical and&#xD;
      radiological (tumor size, midline shift and peritumoral edema) parameters which are defined&#xD;
      as intracranial hypertension signs in brain tumor patients. The observations obtained in this&#xD;
      study have important clinical implications to neurosurgeons, neurologists, and&#xD;
      neurooncologists in order to define the timing of surgical procedures, medical treatments&#xD;
      such as steroids and osmotic agents and indications for monitoring in the ICU.&#xD;
