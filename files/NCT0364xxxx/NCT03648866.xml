  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this thematic analysis is to understand the experience of&#xD;
      &quot;Compassion Rounds&quot; for patients, families, friends, and clinicians. The secondary objective&#xD;
      of this study is to evaluate and interpret data to determine best practice recommendations&#xD;
      for standardization and scalability.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This research will be conducted as a Thematic Analysis. Participants will be recruited from&#xD;
      those who take part in compassion rounds, including patients, their loved ones, physicians,&#xD;
      chaplains, social workers, nurses, and other care providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data on participants' experiences throughout the intervention will be collected&#xD;
      and analyzed using thematic methodology. The data will be used to explain the psychosocial&#xD;
      processes that influence participant experience and reported outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative methodology does not seek to verify hypotheses based on logical assumptions, as&#xD;
      quantitative measures do, instead it is used to derive salient constructs directly from the&#xD;
      data. This methodology allows inductive understanding of participants' social reality and&#xD;
      perceptions of the treatment, resulting in explanations of how the treatment leads to&#xD;
      outcomes and the identification of variables that may then be quantified for more&#xD;
      generalizable study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Semi-structured Interviews&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through semi-structured interviews, which will be recorded and transcribed, the researcher&#xD;
      asks participants open-ended questions intended to elicit perspectives on their experience of&#xD;
      compassion rounds, without limiting responses to pre-determined categories of interest. The&#xD;
      following are examples:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;What/who do you remember most vividly?&quot; &quot;How would you describe your experience to a&#xD;
      friend?&quot; &quot;What was most meaningful to you? &quot;What made you feel uncomfortable?&quot; &quot;Would you do&#xD;
      it again? Why or why not?&quot; &quot;What, if anything, changed after compassion rounding?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coding&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher codes and documents throughout data collection and analysis to lend&#xD;
      transparency to the coding process and to keep a record of ideas to inform thematic&#xD;
      exposition. The researcher assigns categorical codes (labels or concepts) to the transcribed&#xD;
      responses line-by-line, analyzing patterns of relationships and using a constant comparison&#xD;
      technique to identify similarities and differences throughout the data. The following coding&#xD;
      techniques will be used to analyze transcriptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  open coding: the researcher segments the data into preliminary categories, based on&#xD;
           similarity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  axial coding: the researcher groups the categories into themes that provide new ways of&#xD;
           seeing and understanding the phenomenon under study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  selective coding: the researcher integrates the categories and themes to articulate a&#xD;
           coherent theory of the phenomenon of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Theoretical Sampling Grounded theory research uses &quot;theoretical sampling&quot; to identify&#xD;
      participants for interviews. Purposive samples are identified to initiate data collection and&#xD;
      analysis, and to select participants who are likely to clarify, verify, or contradict data as&#xD;
      it is collected. Sampling concludes when the data is &quot;saturated,&quot; which occurs when coded&#xD;
      categories are well-defined and no new significant insights are emerging from interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thematic Development and Validation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher develops thematic explanations that stem from rendering participants'&#xD;
      experiences throughout the practice of compassion rounding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Themes are evaluated for fit and relevance and employee participants may be asked to validate&#xD;
      the researcher's findings in follow-up interviews and focus groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observation The researcher will also observe compassion rounding to collect data that will&#xD;
      provide further insight to participants' experiences. Observations of interactions and&#xD;
      reactions in real time will be documented and the data will be coded and analyzed using the&#xD;
      techniques described above. Observational data will not be integrated into interview data,&#xD;
      but will be used to confirm or contrast reported data.&#xD;
