    <measure>Total score change from baseline at 4 weeks post-injection of Jankovic Rating scale</measure>
    <time_frame>At 4 weeks post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the change of JRS (Jankovic Rating scale) score at 4 weeks post treatment based on baseline(0 week).&#xD;
JRS total score will be calculated as the sum (0~8) of two sub-scores of severity and frequency (0~4 each for severity and frequency) of blepharospasm.</description>

    <measure>Total score change from baseline at 16 weeks post-injection of Jankovic Rating scale</measure>

    <measure>Change from baseline at 4 weeks and 16 weeks of Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>At 4 weeks and 16 weeks post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the change of Blepharospasm Disability Index at 4 weeks and 16 weeks post treatment.&#xD;
Functional disability assessment scale will be assessed as functional disability score. Functional disability assessment scale consists of 6 daily activities (reading, watching television, household activities (cleaning, etc.), mobility, driving, work).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Response evaluated by investigator at 4 weeks and 16 weeks after post-injection</measure>
    <time_frame>At 4 weeks and 16 weeks post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the Investigator's assessment of global response at Weeks 4 and 16 after treatment.&#xD;
At Weeks 4 and 16 Visits after treatment, the investigator will assess global response on a 9-point scale from -4 (marked worsening) to +4 (Complete abolition of all signs and symptoms).</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline at 4 weeks and 16 weeks of WHO-Quality of Life(QOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 4 weeks and 16 weeks post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the change in WHO-Quality of Life (QoL) at Weeks 4 and 16 after treatment from baseline WHOQOL will be assessed by the brief Korean version of WHOQOL (WHOQOL-BREF). The Korean WHOQOL-BREF consists of a total of 26 subscales in 4 domains: physical health (7 items), psychological health (6 items), social relationships (3 items), and environment (8 items). Items in each subscale are in a range from 1 (not at all or very dissatisfied) to 5 (very much or very satisfied).</description>
