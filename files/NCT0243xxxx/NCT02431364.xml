      3 to healthy adult participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 8 participants each (6 active, 2 placebo) will be sequentially administered&#xD;
      verdinexor or placebo (one dose on Day 1 and one dose on Day 3) using a dose-escalation&#xD;
      scheme. A conservative, sequential, dose-escalation strategy employing decreasing escalation&#xD;
      increments will be used.&#xD;

    <description>An AE was defined as the appearance of (or worsening of any pre-existing) undesirable sign, symptom, or medical condition that occur after participant's signed informed consent obtained. A serious adverse event (SAE) was defined as any AE, occurring at any dose (including after the informed consent form was signed and prior to dosing) that and regardless of causality that: results in death, was life-threatening (participant was at immediate risk of death from event as it occurred), requires in-patient hospitalization (formal admission to a hospital for medical reasons) or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect. TEAE was defined as any AE with onset or worsening of a pre-existing condition on or after the first administration of study treatment through 30 days following last dose or any event considered drug-related by the investigator through the end of the study.</description>

             use). A urine cotinine test will be performed at screening and at the time of clinic&#xD;
             check-in prior to study drug treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has any surgical or medical condition that potentially may alter the&#xD;
             absorption, metabolism, or excretion of the study drug such as gastrectomy, Crohn's&#xD;
             disease, or liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has a history of clinically significant allergies. Hay fever is&#xD;
             allowed unless it is active or has required treatment within the previous 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of a chronic condition(s) with clinical or historical evidence of recent&#xD;
             exacerbation, or other information to suggest non-control of such condition(s).&#xD;

          -  History of alcohol abuse or drug addiction within 12 months of the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any participant with active cataracts or medical history of cataracts.&#xD;

        <description>An AE was defined as the appearance of (or worsening of any pre-existing) undesirable sign, symptom, or medical condition that occur after participant's signed informed consent obtained. A serious adverse event (SAE) was defined as any AE, occurring at any dose (including after the informed consent form was signed and prior to dosing) that and regardless of causality that: results in death, was life-threatening (participant was at immediate risk of death from event as it occurred), requires in-patient hospitalization (formal admission to a hospital for medical reasons) or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect. TEAE was defined as any AE with onset or worsening of a pre-existing condition on or after the first administration of study treatment through 30 days following last dose or any event considered drug-related by the investigator through the end of the study.</description>
