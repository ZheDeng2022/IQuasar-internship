    <textblock>
      Disease in coronary arteries kills more people in the UK than any other cause. The&#xD;
      investigators have developed a computer system ('VIRTU') which predicts blood pressure&#xD;
      changes inside coronary arteries. This is important because;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Doctors make better decisions regarding when and how to treat patients with coronary&#xD;
           artery disease if they have these blood pressure measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Currently, Doctors have to insert a metal wire inside the heart to measure artery&#xD;
           pressures which is time-consuming and requires special equipment, staff, training and&#xD;
           medicines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although this invasive technique saves lives and money, more than 95% of patients do not&#xD;
      receive the procedure or the benefits it provides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIRTU provides a solution to this problem since it only needs X-ray pictures and does not&#xD;
      require any wires, drugs, or additional time, equipment or staff. VIRTU has been tested and&#xD;
      works but needs improving before it can be used in all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GOALS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following, and compared with, our pilot project ((Modelling the significance of coronary&#xD;
      artery disease, STH 15740) to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Improve VIRTU's accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Improve VIRTU's speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Test VIRTU in patients with more complicated coronary disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred patients will be recruited from angiography waiting lists and consented before&#xD;
      attending for their angiography. The patients will be asked whether their angiogram pictures&#xD;
      and pressure measurements maybe used as part of the data collection for this study. The data&#xD;
      will be used to validate and develop VIRTU to make it 'patient-ready'. VIRTU will deliver all&#xD;
      the advantages of the current invasive technique (i.e. reduced deaths, heart attacks and&#xD;
      cost) but, is less invasive and usable in 100% patients.&#xD;

      1. Plan of Investigation Several interacting workstreams will proceed in parallel in this&#xD;
           observational, analytical, 36-month study between the University of Sheffield (UoS),&#xD;
           Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (STH), and our collaborators at King's&#xD;
           College London (KCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
           This protocol document outlines the methodology for clinical data collection from&#xD;
           patients attending STH. These (fully anonymised) clinical data will then be used to&#xD;
           validate and optimise the use of VIRTU by improving its accuracy and speed as well as&#xD;
           developing a user-friendly interface. The development work will take place within the&#xD;
           UoS and KCL, with no impact on NHS patient, staff or premises after the clinical data&#xD;
           collection described below (these subsequent workstreams are detailed in Appendix 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study design A phase II, observational, analytical study of coronary angiography and&#xD;
           computational fluid dynamics in 100 adults with coronary artery disease undergoing&#xD;
           coronary angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Methodology (Workstream 1) Clinical data will be collected from the Cardiac Catheter&#xD;
           Laboratory (CCL) at STH in a similar manner to which was performed in a pilot project.&#xD;
           Therefore, the feasibility of recruitment targets and modelling techniques to be used in&#xD;
           this study have already been demonstrated. In this current study, 100 patients with&#xD;
           stable CAD of any pattern/severity, potentially suitable for PCI, will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Potential participants will be identified by a member of the care team from&#xD;
           pre-admission clinic lists in the cardiac catheter laboratory at the time of diagnostic&#xD;
           angiography or referral from another Cardiologist. These patients will be sent a patient&#xD;
           information sheet. If they are interested in finding out more about the study, the&#xD;
           patients will meet with the Research Nurse or Doctor to discuss the project in more&#xD;
           detail and ask questions. At the pre-admission clinic the Research Nurse or Doctor will&#xD;
           take informed consent from those patients willing to participate and complete the study&#xD;
           recruitment log and the Clinical Details section of the Data Collection Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The patients will then attend for their scheduled PCI at the Northern General Hospital&#xD;
           at a later date (usually 2 -3 weeks after the pre-admission clinic). Details of the&#xD;
           clinical procedure are below. During the PCI a member of the research team (Dr Gunn, Dr&#xD;
           Morton, Dr Morris or Research Nurse) will record the arterial diagrams and procedure&#xD;
           details on the second part of the anonymised Data Collection Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Clinical Procedure Selected patients will be asked to undergo cardiac magnetic resonance&#xD;
           imaging before and after PCI, using a standardised protocol. All clinical and&#xD;
           angiographic techniques are in routine NHS clinical practice. No experimental techniques&#xD;
           will be used. Pre- and post procedure care will not alter from routine elective PCI&#xD;
           care.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The PCI will proceed as normal where indicated, using best contemporary practice,&#xD;
           including premedication. The study methods are in routine use for many patients&#xD;
           undergoing PCI; and include rotational coronary angiography and pressure wire deployment&#xD;
           to assess the physiological significance of lesions. This study merely requires that&#xD;
           they be used systematically using standardised methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Rotational coronary angiography will be recorded in standard single axis rotations&#xD;
           (cranial and caudal for left coronary; plane PA for right coronary). An intravenous&#xD;
           bolus of 200mcg GTN will be given prior to each run. They will be done on a breath hold,&#xD;
           with a rapid hand injection of 10-20mL of contrast. Also, standard, single plane,&#xD;
           orthogonal, carefully selected, angiograms will be recorded to guide the procedure.&#xD;
           These will be performed at baseline and after stent deployment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All major epicardial diseased vessels will be interrogated with a pressure wire (Volcano&#xD;
           Corporation). An infusion of adenosine (140mcg/kg/min) will be set up and attached to&#xD;
           the intravenous cannula in the hand/arm. The pressure wire will be calibrated against&#xD;
           the guide catheter pressure, with the introducing needle removed. The wire will then be&#xD;
           advanced across the lesion(s). A bolus of 200mcg GTN will be given and then the iv&#xD;
           adenosine infusion started (repeated as necessary since adenosine has very short half&#xD;
           life). When the pressures have stabilised, the baseline pressure and flow velocity will&#xD;
           be recorded as the wire is withdrawn, while imaging, at 1cm/sec.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Stent implantation will proceed according to the clinical judgment of the operator,&#xD;
           using both the angiographic appearance and the pressure gradient (Fractional Flow&#xD;
           Reserve) across any lesions of interest as arbiters. Standard criteria will be used;&#xD;
           namely a stenosis that appears to be &gt;50% diameter stenosis in 2 orthogonal projections&#xD;
           by eye (or &gt;70% in one) and/or an FFR &lt;0.80. The choice of stent will be at the&#xD;
           discretion of the operator.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After stent deployment, the rotational angiograms and pressure wire pullback will be&#xD;
           repeated, using the methods described above. In the case of multi-vessel disease, the&#xD;
           pullback will be repeated for the 2nd and the 3rd vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Setting for the project Clinical data collection will happen over a 30 month period&#xD;
           within Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Northern General Hospital.&#xD;
           Cardiac Catheter Laboratory will be used for all procedures, because it possesses single&#xD;
           axis rotational angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Patient population One hundred patients will be recruited from PCI waiting lists.&#xD;
