    <textblock>
      Background: Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) remains the reference treatment for&#xD;
      moderate to severe forms of the Sleep Apnea/Hypopnea Syndrome (SAHS). Compliance to the&#xD;
      treatment appears to be a key factor to improving health status of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The investigators conducted a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled,&#xD;
      parallel group trial of standard support completed or not within 3 months of coaching&#xD;
      sessions for newly diagnosed SAHS patients starting CPAP therapy. The coaching session&#xD;
      consisted of 5 sessions of telephone-based counseling by competent staff. The primary outcome&#xD;
      was the proportion of patients using CPAP more than 3 hours per night for 4 months; the&#xD;
      secondary outcome was mean hours of CPAP usage in the 2 groups.&#xD;

      We conducted a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled, parallel group trial of&#xD;
      standard support versus phone coaching for newly diagnosed SAHS patients starting CPAP&#xD;
      therapy. Patients for clinical polysomnographic evaluation were recruited from April 2010 to&#xD;
      March 2012. Those who were subsequently diagnosed with SAHS and prescribed CPAP were included&#xD;
      in the study. The patient population was then randomized into two groups, one that received&#xD;
      standard CPAP support only and the other standard support completed by a coaching session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure Standard support All patients in this study underwent this procedure, which is the&#xD;
      regular procedure in France. In short, the patient received information by their physician,&#xD;
      about modalities and usefulness of CPAP treatment. In the week following this information, a&#xD;
      technician from the home care provider (SADIR based in France) brought CPAP equipment to the&#xD;
      home, re-explained the device function and checked the mask adaptation to the patient. The&#xD;
      follow-up of the patient by the home care provider consisted of one visit at home the first&#xD;
      month to check the mask's tolerance and the functioning of the machine. An other visit was&#xD;
      performed after 4 months to assess CPAP parameters (length of use, mask leaks, and residual&#xD;
      AHI). Sleep physician checked the compliance and efficiency of CPAP treatment once the first&#xD;
      month, then at 3 and 6 months. The compliance was then assessed by patient questioning and by&#xD;
      looking at the data registered by the machine. After this period, the medical follow up was&#xD;
      performed once a year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coached group In the coached group (CG), patients received standard support completed by 5&#xD;
      sessions (day 3, 10, 30, 60, 90 with equipment at home) of telephone-based counselling&#xD;
      session by competent staff. Sessions were performed by a qualified person in education,&#xD;
      qualifies by a university degree (Paul Sabatier University, Toulouse, France). The dates of&#xD;
      phone calls were planned with the patient availabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the first session was to assess the patient's knowledge about the disease,&#xD;
      device and health consequences. The importance of good adherence was emphasized, encouraging&#xD;
      the patients to use the CPAP device throughout sleep every day. Objectives of the other&#xD;
      educational sessions were first to identify disadvantages or obstacles to follow CPAP&#xD;
      treatment and then focus on the benefits linked to use of CPAP. A particular effort was made&#xD;
      to discuss misconceptions about sleep apnea and barriers to use, concerns fears and beliefs,&#xD;
      as well as the perceptions of their partners and family, in order to increase patients'&#xD;
      positive expectations regarding CPAP benefits. The qualified person in education could also&#xD;
      refer any problems in links with SAHS encountered by the patient to the technician,&#xD;
      psychologist or dietician (employed by the home care provider). They can respectively help&#xD;
      the patient with CPAP technical advice, mentally blocked with CPAP or diet counseling. The&#xD;
      average length of each phone call was approximately 15 to 20 minutes.&#xD;
