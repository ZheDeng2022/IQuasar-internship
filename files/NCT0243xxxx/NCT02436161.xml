      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary care management collaborative&#xD;
      program for high-risk patients with heart failure (HF) who are admitted at hospital, based on&#xD;
      the 6 components of the Chronic Care Model &quot;PROMIC&quot;, in terms of reduction of a Combined&#xD;
      event rate (readmissions / cardiac events / death / emergency department visits) and other&#xD;
      variables, the feasibility of the program, the improvement on quality of life related to&#xD;
      health and functional capacity of the PROMIC patients compared with control patients in usual&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: A quasi-experimental, prospective one year follow-up study. SETTING AND SUBJECTS:&#xD;
      Primary Health care Centres of Interior County in Bizkaia and of Araba County in Araba,&#xD;
      Galdakao Hospital, Santa Marina Hospital and University hospital os Araba in the Basque&#xD;
      Country. Will be captured as a minimum intervention group of 125 patients admitted for HF in&#xD;
      New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional status II-III-IV from previous mentioned&#xD;
      hospitals. Another 125 patients from different primary health care centers, will be the&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION: The intervention to be applied will be PROMIC, control patients will receive&#xD;
      usual care MEASUREMENTS: The mean outcome measure will be the time free of events from the&#xD;
      time of inclusion to the first event (readmission / cardiac events / death / emergency&#xD;
      visits). Secondary endpoints will be the quality of life related to health (MLFHQ and SF-12),&#xD;
      functional capacity (6-Minute Walk Test), structural changes in cardiac structure&#xD;
      (natriuretic peptide levels), adherence to drug treatment (Morinsky-Green), the cost of the&#xD;
      program, the usefulness and acceptability of PROMIC by professionals and patients. Predictor&#xD;
      variables also will be collected such as sex, age, education level, co-morbidity, social risk&#xD;
      level, dependency etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Analysis was performed by intention to treat. Survival curves will&#xD;
      done. A model of Cox proportional hazards will be built.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION In light of the increased prevalence of chronic diseases and comorbidities as a&#xD;
      result of the increased life expectancy of the population, the need to develop care models&#xD;
      that adequately respond to the healthcare and sociodemographic needs of the populatión in the&#xD;
      actual context in which they are applied has been proposed. Patients with chronic and/or&#xD;
      multiple diseases present the greatest health care needs and tend to experience the&#xD;
      imbalances in the system with the greatest intensity. Investigators have concentrated the&#xD;
      research on patients admitted because of HF due to the high prevalence and complexity of this&#xD;
      disease and the fact that such patients present multiple chronic conditions. These patients&#xD;
      are normally elderly and present high degrees of comorbidity and poly-medication, poor&#xD;
      treatment adherence and difficulties in selfcare. The majority of patients admitted with HF&#xD;
      are in level 3 of the Kaiser pyramid together with other patients with complex health care&#xD;
      needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is some evidence that a higher degree of multidisciplinarity results in better team&#xD;
      coordinatión and training and more effective care for complex high-risk patients, of which HF&#xD;
      patients are a good example.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROMIC is an organisational care management innovation that provides a comprehensive and&#xD;
      integrated approach to patients with a high degree of complexity, in this case, patients&#xD;
      admitted with HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It promotes the integratión of care in different healthcare settings with the change of the&#xD;
      nurses role and self-care training in patients. As such, PROMIC helps to ensure the&#xD;
      continuity of patients care in their own environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the innovative care model that PROMIC is intended to provide in high-risk HF&#xD;
      patients is to improve health outcomes and to modify the current care model for chronic&#xD;
      diseases, thereby serving as the foundation for future interventions targetting other chronic&#xD;
      patients with multiple comorbidities and complex health care needs. Indeed, precisely due to&#xD;
      the presence of comorbidities in this type of patient, investigators consider coordination&#xD;
      with consultants from other specialities to be essential. As HF patients present marked&#xD;
      comorbidity, investigators expect that the experience acquired during this project will help&#xD;
      them to design interventions that can be broadened to cover all complex chronic patients&#xD;
      likely to benefit from a care management programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary care management collaborative&#xD;
           program for high-risk patients with HF who are admitted at hospital, based on the 6&#xD;
           components of the Chronic Care Model &quot;PROMIC&quot;, in terms of reduced Combined event rate&#xD;
           (readmissions / cardiac events / death / emergency department visits) and other&#xD;
           variables, the feasibility of the program, the improvement on quality of life related to&#xD;
           health and functional capacity of the PROMIC patients compared with control patients in&#xD;
           usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To understand the opinion of the professionals involved in the process using discussion&#xD;
           and consensus methods in order to design the most effective and comprehensive clinical&#xD;
           and organisational intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this project is to establish a sustainable care model for patients admitted with&#xD;
      HF that improves their health outcomes. The understanding gained during implementation of&#xD;
      this model will lead to further research involving the care of other types of complex chronic&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY DESIGN: A quasi-experimental, prospective one year follow-up study. SETTING AND&#xD;
      SUBJECTS: Primary Health care Centres of Interior County in Bizkaia and of Araba County in&#xD;
      Araba, Galdakao Hospital, Santa Marina Hospital and University hospital os Araba in the&#xD;
      Basque Country. Will be captured as a minimum intervention group of 125 patients admitted for&#xD;
      HF in NYHA functional status II-III-IV from previous mentioned hospitals. Another 125&#xD;
      patients from different primary health care centers will be the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION: The intervention to be applied will be PROMIC, control patients will receive&#xD;
      usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROMIC is an organizational innovation comprising a complex intervention containing&#xD;
      components supported by scientific evidence from both a content based on clinical practice&#xD;
      guidelines, (CPGs) as well as regarding its implementation, which is based on the Chronic&#xD;
      Care Model (CCM), developed by Ed Wagner at the McColl Institute (Seattle, USA) in the 1990s.&#xD;
      As this is a complex intervention, investigators have selected the theoretical and&#xD;
      methodological framework for the design and evaluation of complex interventions in a clinical&#xD;
      setting developed by the healthcare and public health services working group of the United&#xD;
      Kingdom Medical Research Council (MRC), which comprises four phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase 0 investigators have undertaken a strategic needs research and evaluation process&#xD;
      and a comprehensive literature search regarding the management of HF patients and complex&#xD;
      chronic comorbid patients in order to identify and select areas for optimization. Phase 1&#xD;
      comprised the design of the intervention program in collaboratión with professionals from the&#xD;
      fields of primary care, hospital and social care, as well as primary researchers and&#xD;
      managers, and the piloting of the intervention with a small number of patients and taking&#xD;
      into account the actual context in the Basque country public health system where Primary care&#xD;
      is very well developed and effective and with a high quality hospital care. The piloting of&#xD;
      the intervention was deployed in 15 polymedicated (mean of 11 drugs) patients admitted with&#xD;
      HF and multiple comorbidities (mean of six chronic diseases) to confirm its feasibility. This&#xD;
      pilot study concluded with positive results and led to the implementation of a&#xD;
      quasi-experimental phase 2 trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (PROMIC) was performed in the framework of each of the six components of the&#xD;
      CCM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Healthcare organisation. Investigators held 18 joint working sessions involving all&#xD;
           components of the multidisciplinary team to establish the content of the clinical care&#xD;
           and organisational interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Delivery system design. A care management model describing the circuits and&#xD;
           communications between healthcare and non-healthcare professionals was defined in these&#xD;
           joint sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Use of clinical information systems. Investigators use an electronic case history shared&#xD;
           by all professionals involved in patient care, which acts as a care record and action&#xD;
           reminder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Decision-making support. Investigators have standardised the information contained in&#xD;
           the discharge planning report and the communications between professionals in the return&#xD;
           home and protocolized the pharmacological treatments indicated in the guidelines. The&#xD;
           individual problems presented by each patient are managed with a comprehensive and&#xD;
           personalized intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Investigators have designed a theoretical/practical training plan for all study&#xD;
           participants 27 hours for physicians and 42 hours for nurses, which has been&#xD;
           complemented with a course on electrocardiography, basic recommendations for cardiology&#xD;
           and drug titration for nursing staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Education about self-care and empowerment of patients and their families. Creation of a&#xD;
           new nursing role aimed at coaching and educating patients and their families and&#xD;
           evaluating their level of understanding and self-care. Investigators have prepared&#xD;
           educational support material for personalized self-care aimed at patients and their&#xD;
           carers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Integration of community resources. Investigators have established meetings and contacts&#xD;
           with social workers and community pharmacists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEASUREMENTS: The mean outcome measure will be the time free of events from the time of&#xD;
      inclusion to the first event (readmission / cardiac events / death / emergency visits).&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints will be the quality of life related to health (MLFHQ and SF-12),&#xD;
      functional capacity (6-Minute Walk Test), structural changes in cardiac structure (brain&#xD;
      natriuretic peptide BNP), adherence to drug treatment (Morinsky- Green questionaire), the&#xD;
      cost of the program based in the adjusted clinical group (ACG) , the usefulness and&#xD;
      acceptability of PROMIC by professionals and patients. Predictor variables also will be&#xD;
