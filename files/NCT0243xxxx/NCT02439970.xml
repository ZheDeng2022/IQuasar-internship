      To compare the efficacy of oral brincidofovir (BCV) to valganciclovir (vGCV) for the&#xD;
      prevention of cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease in kidney transplant allograft recipients who are&#xD;
      CMV seronegative pretransplant and received a kidney from a CMV seropositive donor&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, multicenter study of the&#xD;
      efficacy, safety, and tolerability of oral BCV versus vGCV for the prevention of CMV disease&#xD;
      in high-risk kidney transplant allograft recipients, defined as CMV-seronegative recipients&#xD;
      (R-) receiving a CMV-seropositive graft (D+). The study comprised a screening evaluation&#xD;
      period (up to 14 days posttransplant), a treatment period (up to 28 weeks posttransplant),&#xD;
      and a posttreatment follow-up period (24 weeks, through Week 52 posttransplant).&#xD;

    <measure>The Incidence of CMV Disease</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks (± 28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence of CMV disease included CMV tissue-invasive disease and CMV syndrome, occurring anytime between randomization and Week 52 (± 28 days).&#xD;
The proportion of subjects that met this failure endpoint were to be compared between brincidofovir (BCV) and valganciclovir (vGCV) using an unadjusted 95% confidence interval (CI) of the absolute difference between groups (BCV minus vGCV). If the upper bound of the 95% CI fell below 10%, BCV would have demonstrated non-inferiority to vGCV. In the event that the upper bound of the 95% CI fell below 0%, BCV would have additionally demonstrated superiority over vGCV.</description>

             resection, ileus, or any condition that was expected to require abdominal surgery&#xD;
             during the course of study participation).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Had serum alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase concentrations &gt;5 x&#xD;
             the upper limit of normal (ULN).&#xD;

             formulations) during the treatment phase of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Had active malignancies (with the exception of basal cell carcinoma).&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Had a serious psychiatric, medical disorder, including abnormal laboratory values,&#xD;
             that would have, in the judgement of the investigator, put the subject at increased&#xD;
             risk by participating in the study, or would have interfered with the conduct of the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;

        <title>The Incidence of CMV Disease</title>
        <description>The incidence of CMV disease included CMV tissue-invasive disease and CMV syndrome, occurring anytime between randomization and Week 52 (± 28 days).&#xD;
The proportion of subjects that met this failure endpoint were to be compared between brincidofovir (BCV) and valganciclovir (vGCV) using an unadjusted 95% confidence interval (CI) of the absolute difference between groups (BCV minus vGCV). If the upper bound of the 95% CI fell below 10%, BCV would have demonstrated non-inferiority to vGCV. In the event that the upper bound of the 95% CI fell below 0%, BCV would have additionally demonstrated superiority over vGCV.</description>
        <time_frame>52 weeks (± 28 days)</time_frame>
        <population>The study was terminated. Enrollment was suspended and all blinded study treatment was discontinued in early January 2016. Due to the premature termination of this study, statistical analyses were not performed. Limited demographic and safety data were provided for the 5 subjects enrolled.</population>
