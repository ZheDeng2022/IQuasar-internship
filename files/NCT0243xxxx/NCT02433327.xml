      Critical illness in the patient and death can potentially be predicted and prevented.&#xD;
      Deterioration of the clinical condition of hospitalised patients is often preceded by&#xD;
      physiological changes up to 24 hours before death. Despite this several reports show that&#xD;
      lack of identification and proper actions in patients developing acute and critical illness&#xD;
      remains a problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate if Paediatric early Warning Score (PEWS)&#xD;
      optimises identification of acute and critically ill children and prevents life-threatening&#xD;
      situations. The hypothesis is that implementation of PEWS supported by directions for action&#xD;
      algorithms for intervention will have an impact on number of unplanned transfers to intensive&#xD;
      care in already hospitalised children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a multi-centre randomised controlled intervention study designed within a&#xD;
      Complex Intervention framework; the study sheds light on the problem, validation of the data&#xD;
      collection instrument, testing of the intervention and evaluation. The study involves all&#xD;
      paediatric departments and some acute departments in Central Denmark Region. The study is&#xD;
      designed as a randomised controlled intervention study where children are randomised to one&#xD;
      of two different Paediatric Early Waning Score models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development and implementation of PEWS is expected to contribute to reduce the number of&#xD;
      children developing acute critical illness, number of admissions to intensive care. PEWS is&#xD;
      also expected to contribute to increase professional skills and competences in health&#xD;
      professionals. It is expected that this study will contribute towards working with a joint&#xD;
      PEWS model in Denmark. Last but not least it must be expected that a PEWS model will&#xD;
      contribute to reducing the costs for society as an intensive care hospital bed is more&#xD;
      expensive than a hospital bed at a general paediatric department.&#xD;

      Introduction Evolving critical illness in the patient and death can potentially be predicted&#xD;
      and prevented. Observation studies indicate that deterioration of the clinical condition of&#xD;
      hospitalised patients is often preceded by physiological changes up to 24 hours before death.&#xD;
      Focus in adult patients has for a number of years been on development of risk scoring system,&#xD;
      also called &quot;Early Warning Score&quot; (EWS) systematically measuring the patients vital status.&#xD;
      International experience shows that systematic observation by EWS accompanied by action&#xD;
      algorithms contributes to prevent cardiac arrest, death and transfer to intensive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In many areas children are different from adults; there are e.g. physiological and anatomical&#xD;
      differences and an EWS system developed for adult can thus not be used in children.&#xD;
      Challenges in assessing if a child is critically ill are related to the child's symptoms of&#xD;
      serious illness often being uncharacteristic. Children can seem relatively unaffected until a&#xD;
      short time before circulatory insufficiency and cardiac arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, there is a need for developing and investigating if an EWS model for ill children has a&#xD;
      significant influence on children's development of acute conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background In Denmark, more than 100,000 children below the age of 15 years are admitted&#xD;
      annually. International studies show that 8.5 - 14.0% of cardiac arrest incidences in&#xD;
      intensive care units involve paediatric patients. Survival is only between 15 - 33% with&#xD;
      subsequent significant neurological outcome in 35% of the surviving children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intention with an EWS system for admitted patients is to ensure that staff identifies a&#xD;
      deterioration in the patient's condition in time. Each value releases a &quot;score&quot; and the total&#xD;
      score determines if treatment should be initiated. International studies in adult patients&#xD;
      have shown that up to 24 hours prior to development of cardiac arrest or life-threatening&#xD;
      situations show signs of acute critical illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are national and international models for EWS in adults. Despite this several&#xD;
      international reports show that lack of identification and proper actions in patients&#xD;
      developing acute and critical illness remains a problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study of 126 deaths among English children showed that 89 deaths occurred in hospital;&#xD;
      among those it was estimated that 63 (71%) could have been avoided. Lack of acknowledging the&#xD;
      severity of the disease was emphasised as a decisive factor together with absence of&#xD;
      measuring and interpreting physical signs correctly. It is paramount for timely care and&#xD;
      treatment of children to work systematically with assessing the child's symptoms and the&#xD;
      severity of these symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quality of the acute treatment has come into focus with a report from the Danish Health&#xD;
      and Medicines Authority. Several paediatric departments have establish simulation training in&#xD;
      care and treatment of the acute and critically ill child to optimise competences in and&#xD;
      ensuring adequate response of healthcare staff. Structured initial assessment of acutely&#xD;
      admitted children - the paediatric triage model - comprises systematic assessment of the&#xD;
      severity of the child's symptoms within the first few minutes. The implemented triage model&#xD;
      determines the order of interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More hospitals have established so-called Rapid Response Teams (RRT), a kind of acute team&#xD;
      which can facilitate early intervention in a ward where the patient develops a&#xD;
      life-threatening situation or cardiac arrest. The criteria for calling the RRT are a central&#xD;
      factor in prevention of acute life-threatening situations and cardiac arrest and early&#xD;
      notification of the RRT improves patient outcome. This project shifts focus from response to&#xD;
      life-threatening situations and cardiac arrest to early warning of critical illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improvement of patient safety is a focus areas in Denmark; this is shown by initiatives such&#xD;
      as the Danish Safer Hospital Programme aimed at reduced mortality and patient harms as well&#xD;
      as the Danish Quality Model aimed at improving quality of health services, reduce harms and&#xD;
      create better patient pathways. Development of standards for systematic observation of&#xD;
      patients and a national clinical guideline for early warning of critical illness in adult&#xD;
      patient are specific initiatives at national level&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children are different from adults Care and treatment of critically ill children is a&#xD;
      challenge as children's symptoms of critical illness can be uncharacteristic. A critically&#xD;
      ill child with sepsis or severely dehydration can seem relatively unaffected and the acute&#xD;
      condition is identified by the affected vital parameters. Children's mechanisms to compensate&#xD;
      are better than in adults as a child is able to maintain an almost normal blood pressure&#xD;
      despite considerable loss of fluid. On the other hand, the child can turn critically ill fast&#xD;
      when the limit for the child's ability to compensate is exceeded. Thus, it is important to&#xD;
      acknowledge and act on the often subtle signs of acute and critical illness in the child as&#xD;
      the prognosis for survival is very poor if the child develops cardiac arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiences with EWS in adults show that the system cannot stand alone but should be seen in&#xD;
      interaction with several factors. In this protocol Paediatric Early Warning Score (PEWS) is&#xD;
      one of several interventions including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Education and training of staff&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standardised monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interprofessional guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Algorithms of action for intervention in the critically ill child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When health professionals do not systematically observe, interpret and act adequately to&#xD;
      changes in the child's condition, it will have serious consequences for the hospitalised&#xD;
      child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Canadian developed PEWS model is one of the most studied model in larger studies. The model&#xD;
      has been developed, tested and subsequently modified and it now consists of seven different&#xD;
      parameters. The model includes measurement of blood pressure, which is a specific challenge&#xD;
      in a paediatric population. Often children are upset when the blood pressure is measured,&#xD;
      which causes the pressure to increase; this increase is not necessarily a sign of clinical&#xD;
      exacerbation of disease. At the same time, blood pressure is a late finding in connection&#xD;
      with evolving critical illness due to the child's ability to compensate; this could be an&#xD;
      argument for not measuring the blood pressure of all hospitalised children. Moreover, the&#xD;
      model does not include assessment of level of consciousness in children; the investigators&#xD;
      believe this is an important factor for assessing if critical illness is evolving in&#xD;
      children. The investigators wish to compare the Canadian model with the investigators &quot;local&quot;&#xD;
      model, which includes assessment of level of consciousness but not measuring of blood&#xD;
      pressure. Measuring of the blood pressure in the &quot;local&quot; model will be performed as an extra&#xD;
      examination in children with a high score i.e. children at risk of evolving critical illness.&#xD;
      Measurement of blood pressure will thus not be used as a screening in all hospitalised&#xD;
      children as in the Canadian model. Apart from this, the two PEWS models are similar; the&#xD;
      underlying action algorithms, age categories and cut off values for vital signs are similar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a PEWS review, concluded that there is a considerable variation in purpose, content and&#xD;
      threshold for actions as well as lack of evidence for validity, reliability and applicability&#xD;
      of the published PEWS models. Reliability is only investigated in one study and no studies&#xD;
      report on the experiences of health professionals concerning the applicability of PEWS. In a&#xD;
      study of PEWS from Great Britain, there was a large variation in use of parameters; 46&#xD;
      different parameters were used and more hospitals used PEWS models which were not validated&#xD;
      or thoroughly investigated. This also applies to EWSs for adults in a Cochrane review, which&#xD;
      also draws attention to the lack of randomised controlled studies (RCT) and studies&#xD;
      investigating the applicability and clinical relevance according to the clinical staff. There&#xD;
      is thus a need and demand for RCT designs to study PEWS but also to study reliability of the&#xD;
      clinical staffs' perception of applicability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study investigates these core issues using a RCT design, which has not yet been&#xD;
      conducted in a paediatric population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose The purpose of this study was to investigate if PEWS in hospitalised children&#xD;
      optimises identification of acute and critically ill children and prevents life-threatening&#xD;
      situations and thus reduce number of unplanned admissions to intensive care, cardiac arrest&#xD;
      and death. Moreover, the study investigated validation of the clinical applicability of PEWS&#xD;
      as well as the acceptability of the tool among healthcare professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Multi-center randomised controlled intervention study within a Complex Intervention&#xD;
      framework; the study sheds light on the problem, validation of the data collection&#xD;
      instrument, testing of the intervention and evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation The departments will all have access to web-based randomisation programme,&#xD;
      &quot;Trialpartner&quot;. Each patient get his or her own number of randomisation. If a patient is&#xD;
      readmitted during the inclusion period he or she will obtain the result of the initial&#xD;
      randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and statistical analysis Data will be analysed on the intention to treat&#xD;
      principles. Number of acute critical conditions will lead to consultation by a neonatal&#xD;
      specialist or an anaesthesiologist and unplanned transfer to intensive care will be&#xD;
      registered. Focus will be on the children's condition in the last 24 hours before documented&#xD;
      acute critical or life-threatening condition (as well as observation level and actions in&#xD;
      relation to the acute critical condition or unplanned transfer to intensive care). As PEWS&#xD;
      must be able to identify children at risk of acute life-threatening condition and at the same&#xD;
      time be a &quot;window&quot; for intervention, the data analysis will stop one hour prior to the&#xD;
      occurrence of the acute life-threatening condition to avoid overestimating the effect of&#xD;
      PEWS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background variables are: child's age, gender, discharge diagnosis, length of&#xD;
      hospitalisation, triage level at admission, vital signs, respiratory status, temperature,&#xD;
      level of consciousness, observation level, initiated interventions, time from observation of&#xD;
      deteriorated condition to adequate intervention. This information will be collected from&#xD;
      patient records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, a power calculation has been made based on accessible data from 2011. With a power&#xD;
      of 80% and an expected reduction in number of transfers to intensive care of 30%, 4,000&#xD;
      children must be included in each group; the total study population is 26,800 children&#xD;
      annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis is planned half-way through the study. The study will be interrupted if&#xD;
      there are significant differences between the two models concerning selected effect&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations The intervention directly affecting hospitalised children will be&#xD;
      measurement of pulse and saturation. Measurements are non-invasive and cause no pain or&#xD;
      discomfort and are standard procedures in most acutely hospitalised children. It is thus not&#xD;
      expected to cause discomfort or give rise to concerns in children and parents. It is&#xD;
      important that patients' experience of anxiety, concern or irritation is addressed and dealt&#xD;
      with. It is therefore of great importance that ward nursing staff is thought to communicate&#xD;
      with and inform patients while they perform the measuring of vital parameters and that&#xD;
      nursing staff in a professional and informative way can argue why the measuring is important.&#xD;
      Several studies show that bedside observations of vital parameters and simple algorithms&#xD;
      based on bedside observations can identify patients at risk of deteriorating. In an ethical&#xD;
      perspective it is therefore unethical not to react to these findings and not to implement a&#xD;
      new ward practice.&#xD;
