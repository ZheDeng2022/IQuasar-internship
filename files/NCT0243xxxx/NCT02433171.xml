  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this protocol is to evaluate the potential of PET imaging of amino acid transport&#xD;
      and microglial activation to improve the differentiation of tumor recurrence and radiation&#xD;
      necrosis in patients with brain metastases after treatment with stereotactic radiosurgery&#xD;
      (SRS) who have re-growing lesions. These state-of-the-art imaging tools will be used in&#xD;
      combination with standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), MR spectroscopy (MRS) and FDG-PET&#xD;
      (fluorodeoxyglucose).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The investigators hypothesize that by using two different PET tracers, one sensitive to tumor&#xD;
      metabolic activity, and one sensitive to inflammatory processes, investigators can separately&#xD;
      identify metabolically active tumor from radiation necrosis related inflammation. This can be&#xD;
      accomplished with quantitative assessments of tracer uptake using kinetic modeling&#xD;
      techniques, as well as by high-resolution imaging to assess the distribution of tracer uptake&#xD;
      in the tumor region. All participants in the study will have the receive the same diagnostic&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;

    <description>[11C]Methionine [11]. This natural amino acid, and its various fluorinated derivatives, has been widely used in brain tumor studies due to a) high tumor-to-normal brain contrast, and b) its sensitivity to biological functions including amino acid transport and utilization. [11C]PBR28 [12]. This ligand is one of a series of second-generation tracers that bind to TSPO (translocator protein), a protein that is upregulated in activated microglia.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients over 18 years with brain metastases from melanoma or non-small cell lung&#xD;
             cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have had SRS and regrowth in at least one lesion &gt; 0.5 cm in greatest&#xD;
             dimension and fall into one of two categories: a) patient is deemed clinically&#xD;
             appropriate for surgical intervention (biopsy or craniotomy) OR b) patient is&#xD;
             asymptomatic and has a life expectancy of &gt; 6 months so that serial follow-up imaging&#xD;
             is appropriate&#xD;

             shrapnel, neurostimulators, defibrillator, artificial heart valve, or history of metal&#xD;
             fragments in eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
