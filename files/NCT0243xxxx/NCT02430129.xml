      This study is a randomized controlled trial comparing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) to&#xD;
      unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) in patients with no to moderate anteromedial knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis. TKA patients will receive the Zimmer Persona (Warsaw, IN) posterior cruciate&#xD;
      retaining total knee arthroplasty, while UKA patients will receive the Biomet Oxford (Warsaw,&#xD;
      IN) mobile bearing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures will include Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index&#xD;
      (WOMAC) and Oxford Knee Score (OKS) questionnaires, as well as biomechanics and EMG analysis&#xD;
      from the investigating gait lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that post-operative UKA patients will display higher clinical&#xD;
      scores using WOMAC and OKS questionnaires, and superior biomechanical analysis measures. The&#xD;
      investigators further hypothesize that the biomechanics data will assist in the understanding&#xD;
      of the outcome score differential both pre- and post-operatively in both groups, as well as&#xD;
      between-groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total follow up period will be two years.&#xD;

      Title:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unicondylar knee arthroplasty versus total knee arthroplasty in patients with anteromedial&#xD;
      osteoarthritis of the knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) offers several possible advantages over total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty (TKA). One important possible advantage is overall higher patient satisfaction&#xD;
      with UKA. Patients have superior post-operative range of motion and a more &quot;natural-feeling&quot;&#xD;
      knee. Previously, patients with patellofemoral joint osteoarthritis (PFJOA) were excluded&#xD;
      from UKA. However, recent studies suggest that excellent results can be achieved with UKA&#xD;
      despite pre-existing moderate PFJOA. This may broaden pre-defined inclusion criteria for UKA.&#xD;
      To date, no biomechanical studies directly comparing UKA and TKA have been performed.&#xD;
      Biomechanical data could help explain outcome differences. This study aims to compare both&#xD;
      clinical and biomechanical outcomes in patients receiving UKA versus TKA for anteromedial OA&#xD;
      in the presence of no to moderate PFJOA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that post-operative UKA patients will display higher clinical scores using&#xD;
      WOMAC and OKS questionnaires, and superior biomechanical analysis measures. In comparing to&#xD;
      healthy controls, we expect to see UKA patients perform more closely to controls than TKA&#xD;
      patients, with regards to WOMAC, OKS, and biomechanical scores. We further hypothesize that&#xD;
      UKA patients will have larger changes in WOMAC and OKS scores pre- to post-operatively than&#xD;
      TKA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized controlled trial. Eligible patients have: anteromedial compartment&#xD;
      osteoarthritis (OA) with intact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) by clinical testing and&#xD;
      alignment on radiographs; normal or mild to moderate PFJOA; angular deformity &lt;15 degrees&#xD;
      passively correctible to neutral; flexion contracture&lt;5 degrees; BMI&lt;40; age 40-80 years. We&#xD;
      exclude patients with: severe PFJOA; history of previous surgery on the affected knee&#xD;
      (excluding simple meniscectomy); inflammatory arthropathy; previous contralateral knee&#xD;
      replacement surgery or major ligament reconstruction surgery. Patients will be stratified&#xD;
      based on their PFJOA status. They will be randomized using StudyTRAX (ScienceTrax, Macon, GA)&#xD;
      online system to one of two treatment arms: UKA (n=19) or TKA (n=19). The control group will&#xD;
      be matched to study group characteristics, and recruited through University of Calgary and&#xD;
      Alberta Hip and Knee Clinic (AHKC). UKA patients will receive a mobile bearing, Oxford UKA&#xD;
      (Biomet, Warsaw, IN) utilizing microplasty instrumentation. TKA patients will receive a&#xD;
      posterior cruciate-retaining TKA with unresurfaced patella utilizing Persona instrumentation&#xD;
      (Zimmer, Warsaw, IN). Clinical outcomes will be assessed pre-operatively, and&#xD;
      post-operatively at 6 weeks, 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years utilizing the WOMAC and OKS&#xD;
      questionnaires. Radiographs include weight bearing anteroposterior (AP), AP, lateral and&#xD;
      skyline views, and valgus stress views. These are standard to treatment at AHKC, and will be&#xD;
      taken preoperatively and at the 2 day (non-weightbearing views only), 3 month, and 1 year&#xD;
      postoperative appointments. Interpretation will be by the treating surgeons.Biomechanical&#xD;
      assessment will include gait analysis and electromyography (EMG), and will be done at the&#xD;
      Clinical Movement Analysis Laboratory (CMAL) at the McCaig Institute. This will be measured&#xD;
      pre-operatively and at one year post-operatively. A healthy, age, gender and weight matched&#xD;
      control group will be recruited to establish deviations of the patient groups from the&#xD;
      healthy norm. Clinical and biomechanical outcomes will be assessed only once for the control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis plan includes descriptive analyses, univariate analysis to explore between-group&#xD;
      differences and repeated-measures ANOVA to assess statistically significant changes in WOMAC,&#xD;
      OKS, and biomechanical outcomes over time within both groups. T-test &amp; Pearson chi-square&#xD;
      test will be computed for all continuous variables and categorical variables, accordingly. A&#xD;
      multivariate linear regression analysis may be performed to reveal relationships between&#xD;
      variables, enabling us to control for baseline variables of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance of work:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No studies to date have investigated whether UKA or TKA is favorable in patients with no to&#xD;
      moderate PFJOA, but who meet all other traditional criteria for UKA. Additionally, no&#xD;
      biomechanical data exists in this area. If patients receiving UKA demonstrate similar (or&#xD;
      better) clinical and biomechanical outcomes to those receiving TKA, then it would suggest&#xD;
      that UKA could be offered to a much greater number of patients, as a less invasive procedure,&#xD;
      with potential health system savings. It is anticipated that the biomechanical data, in&#xD;
      combination with the clinical research data, will help to better understand the differences&#xD;
      between these two surgical approaches.&#xD;
