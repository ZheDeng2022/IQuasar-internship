  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) occurs after rupture of cerebral aneurysms. Treatment of SAH&#xD;
      focuses on avoiding medical complications including cerebral vasospasm, which may result in&#xD;
      limited circulation to the brain. Cerebral vasospasm, or thinning of the arteries of the&#xD;
      brain, is a feared complication that could potentially cause stroke and worst outcomes after&#xD;
      SAH. Hypertonic saline (HTS) is a compound that may be used to prevent vasospasm following&#xD;
      SAH by enhancing the circulation in the brain. This study will evaluate if a protocol of&#xD;
      volume expansion with HTS is safe and effective in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage for&#xD;
      the prevention of cerebral vasospasm.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center, interventional, randomized, parallel, two-arm (1:1)&#xD;
      phase II clinical trial with blinded end-point ascertainment designed to determine the safety&#xD;
      and feasibility of a protocol of 3% hypertonic saline (HTS) as a &quot;volume expander&quot;&#xD;
      administered within 72-hours of admission and up to 7-days in SAH patients compared to&#xD;
      standard fluid management, in individuals with aneurysmal SAH. A common sequela of aneurysmal&#xD;
      SAH is vasospasm, which causes significant morbidity and mortality. In addition, 30% of&#xD;
      patients with SAH develop hypovolemic hyponatremia (serum sodium [Na] &lt;130mEq/L),&#xD;
      predisposing them to develop cerebral ischemia. Current guidelines for the management of&#xD;
      aneurysmal SAH recommend: (1) maintaining euvolemia in order to prevent delayed cerebral&#xD;
      ischemia (DCI) and (2) using HTS as a treatment option for the prevention and treatment of&#xD;
      hypovolemic hyponatremia. Treatment for vasospasm includes induction of hypertension, along&#xD;
      with systemic and/or intra-arterial administration of calcium channel blockers, or&#xD;
      angioplasty. The investigators will (1) measure the incidence of severe adverse events from&#xD;
      our protocol of HTS, (2) measure the incidence of cerebral vasospasm in patients treated with&#xD;
      our protocol of HTS as compared to patients treated with standard fluid therapy; and (3)&#xD;
      assess the burden of hypovolemic hyponatremia.&#xD;
