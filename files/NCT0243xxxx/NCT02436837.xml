      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking into consideration the ongoing inversion of the population pyramid and the limitations&#xD;
      and medical conditions, which predispose to episodes of falling among elderly people, the&#xD;
      implementation of exercises and physical treatments capable of promoting postural balance in&#xD;
      the group studied is made necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess the influence of the electronic platform Kinect Sensor® (KS) as a tool in the&#xD;
      treatment of postural balance in elderly individuals. Method: The study included 10 elderly&#xD;
      (60 to 70 years old) and 10 young (20 to 30 years old) individuals. Treatment protocol&#xD;
      composed of five weeks with sessions performed twice a week with application of KS. Initial&#xD;
      and final evaluation included static and dynamic balance instruments: Berg Balance scale and&#xD;
      Timed up and Go and Romberg Tandem tests.&#xD;

      Sample Each volunteer has agreed to participate of this research after signing a informed&#xD;
      consent. The present work has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Research of the School&#xD;
      of Medical and Health Sciences of Juiz de Fora, SUPREMA University, Juiz de Fora, Brazil,&#xD;
      under the statement 0015/12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject filled adequately an anamnesis questionnaire composed of items which referred to&#xD;
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Those considered incapable of performing activities&#xD;
      involving maintenance of balance or belonging to the health risk group were excluded. Health&#xD;
      risk was defined by criteria such as, cardiopathies, uncontrolled hypertension, auditory and&#xD;
      visual impairment, neurological disturbances and severe muscle-skeletal conditions. Besides&#xD;
      those factors, scores inferior to 45 points in the Berg Balance Scale also resulted in&#xD;
      exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to collect data, 26 individuals from the Hospital and Maternity Ward Therezinha de&#xD;
      Jesus (School of Medical and Health Sciences of Juiz de Fora, SUPREMA University, Juiz de&#xD;
      Fora, Brazil) were evaluated. Among them, six have been excluded for distinct reasons, such&#xD;
      as, abandoning the proposed sessions or presenting risk factors inserted in the exclusion&#xD;
      criteria of the study. The experimental group was composed by 10 subjects (eight females)&#xD;
      with mean age of 64.5 years old and the control group had other 10 participants (five&#xD;
      females) with mean age 23 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sampled individuals were subject to a sequence of tests specifically devised for static&#xD;
      and dynamic balance, which could be used as a comparison parameter for postural balance among&#xD;
      the individuals. The tests applied were: a) Timed Up and Go test (TUG); b) Romberg Tandem&#xD;
      test; c) Berg Balance scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol Treatment protocol consisted of 10 sessions with maximal length of 6 minutes for&#xD;
      performing activities using the KS. The interval between the evaluations was of five weeks&#xD;
      and the sessions took place twice times a week, according to the participant availability.&#xD;
      Before the first session and one day preceding the last, the individuals were evaluated in&#xD;
      what concerns static and dynamic balance. Arterial pressure (AP) measurement and stretching&#xD;
      activity were performed prior to the KS session. Afterwards, AP was again measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Berg Balance Scale Berg Balance scale was the main instrument in the assessment of the&#xD;
      postural balance, which was also used as exclusion criterion. It is used in the clinical&#xD;
      practice, mainly for the elderly population or neurologic disturbed patients, who have been&#xD;
      referred to rehabilitation. The test is constituted of 14 ordinary static and dynamic balance&#xD;
      tasks, which are related to quotidian life activities, such as getting up, transfer oneself,&#xD;
      standing up, reaching for an object and turning. Each task generates a score between zero and&#xD;
      four points, so that the total may be of 56 points. Points are subtracted from the total of a&#xD;
      task, if the subject needs aid or external support device to accomplish the particular task.&#xD;
      According to Berg et al., patient scoring less or equal to 45 are at high risk of falling&#xD;
      during ambulation, what justify the exclusion of volunteers to whom was attributed an&#xD;
      inferior score aforementioned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timed Up and Go Test In order to perform the Timed Up and Go test (TUG), the subject would&#xD;
      rise from a chair, walk three meters and return to the chair. The speed of task execution was&#xD;
      established by the participant, with no stimulation by use of verbal commands. The time of&#xD;
      execution was measured on the initial evaluation and one day past the tenth session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Romberg TandemTest According to the protocol established by the Romberg Tandem test, the&#xD;
      participants remained with the eyes closed in orthostatic position, with the calcaneus bone&#xD;
      of the non-dominant foot placed ahead of the toes of the dominant foot, until the loose&#xD;
      balance or reach 60 seconds, maximal time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial Pressure Arterial pressure (AP) was measured before and after each session.&#xD;
      Individuals presenting hypertension stage 3 (≥ 180 systolic and ≥ 110 diastolic), which poses&#xD;
      a threat to their practicing of physical activity, were withdrawn of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stretching After AP measurement, all subjects were instructed to perform muscular stretching&#xD;
      exercises. The activities were performed in an active and assisted fashion, bilaterally, such&#xD;
      as lateral cervical flexion, anterior and posterior inclination of the cervical column,&#xD;
      orthostatic torso flexion, torso lateral inclination and rotation on the transverse plane.&#xD;
      With the upper limbs, the motions proposed were flexion of shoulder and elbow, horizontal&#xD;
      adduction of shoulders and flexion and extension of fingers and wrists. The participants also&#xD;
      performed global exercises, cross walks, touching the knees with the hands alternately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kinect Sensor All the individuals, including the ones placed in the control group, were&#xD;
      instructed on the execution of the activities and accompanied through verbal commands. They&#xD;
      were positioned in front of the KS with the highest level of Stack em Up mode (available&#xD;
      under the title Yourshape: Fitness Evolved®), and should keep static position with upper&#xD;
      limbs raised, simulating sustain a platform. Colored boxes fall upon the simulated platform&#xD;
      and must be deposited with the lateral inclination of the torso towards left or right,&#xD;
      according to visual stimulus from the television, where virtual apertures are opened on&#xD;
      alternate sides at the bottom of the screen. Eventually, fiery boxes fall, and it is&#xD;
      necessary to raise the inferior limb of the side where the box is falling towards the&#xD;
      platform in order to extinguish the fire, thus flexing knee and pelvic region at 90º.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistic Analysis D'agostino &amp; Pearson test was applied to verify the normality of the data.&#xD;
      The mean analysis was done by paired Student's t-test for parametric data and Wilcoxon test&#xD;
      for non-parametric for the data of each group; unpaired Student's t-test was performed for&#xD;
      parametric data and Mann Whitney test for non-parametric data between the evaluated groups.&#xD;
