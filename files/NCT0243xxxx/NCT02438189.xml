    <textblock>
      Objective: to gain experience with in-home use of a modified algorithm that will dose insulin&#xD;
      to minimize projected hyperglycemia overnight in addition to suspending the pump if&#xD;
      hypoglycemia is projected overnight and to obtain feasibility, safety, and initial efficacy&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: randomized controlled trial, with randomization on a night level within&#xD;
      subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major Eligibility Criteria: clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, daily insulin therapy for&#xD;
      at least one year and an insulin infusion pump for at least 6 months; 15.0 to &lt;46.0 years of&#xD;
      age; HbA1c &lt; 10.0%; no DKA in last 6 months; no hypoglycemic seizure or loss of consciousness&#xD;
      in last 6 months; Living with a significant other or family member (&quot;companion&quot;) committed to&#xD;
      participating in all study activities, and being present and available to provide assistance&#xD;
      when the system is being used at night.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: 30 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration and Visit Schedule: duration approximately 3 months, with preliminary run-in&#xD;
      activities followed by up to 90 days spent in clinical trial phase of study; clinic visits at&#xD;
      enrollment, following CGM and system assessment run-in phases, at start of clinical trial&#xD;
      phase, at 21-day point of clinical trial phase, and after 42 nights of successful system use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major Efficacy Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary: time in range (70-180 mg/dl, 3.9-10.0 mmol/L) overnight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary: time spent in hypoglycemia (≤70 mg/dl, 3.9 mmol/L) and time spent in&#xD;
           hyperglycemia (&gt;180 mg/dl, 10.0 mmol/L) overnight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major Safety Outcomes: CGM measures of hypo- and hyperglycemia, including morning blood&#xD;
      glucose and mean overnight sensor glucose; adverse events including severe hypoglycemia and&#xD;
      diabetic ketoacidosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who are eligible for the clinical trial initially will use a Veo insulin pump and&#xD;
      Enlite 2 CGM sensor at home for a minimum of 6 days/week over a 2-week period to verify that&#xD;
      the subject is able to use the CGM and insert sensors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 10 subjects enrolled will participate in a 2-day overnight hotel-based pilot,&#xD;
      collecting a total of 20 nights of data and experience with the system in a transitional&#xD;
      hotel setting. The DSMB will review safety data from the 20 night hotel-based pilot study and&#xD;
      make recommendations regarding proceeding to the at-home portion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following DSMB review and approval of the safety data from the hotel study, the first 10&#xD;
      subjects will participate in an Algorithm Assessment Phase of approximately 10 nights of&#xD;
      Predictive Low Glucose Suspend (PLGS) + Hyper Minimization system use each (for a nominal&#xD;
      total of 100 nights of use at home) to determine if any adjustments to the algorithm&#xD;
      parameters are needed and if it is safe to advance to the randomized clinical trial phase. If&#xD;
      adjustments are needed, the Algorithm Assessment Phase will be repeated, using the same 10&#xD;
      subjects if possible. Once the randomized clinical trial phase begins, approximately 200&#xD;
      nights of randomized system use will be collected and assessed for safety by the DSMB before&#xD;
      proceeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New subjects who enroll in the study after the completion of the Algorithm Assessment Phase&#xD;
      will use the PLGS+Hyper Minimization closed-loop system at home for at least 5 days to&#xD;
      demonstrate their ability to use the system and submit study data to the Coordinating Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who successfully demonstrate their ability to use the system at home as described&#xD;
      above will be eligible for the randomized trial phase. This phase consists of use of the full&#xD;
      system in the home for approximately 42 nights:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each night the blood glucose level will be checked with the BG meter and used to perform&#xD;
           a calibration of the CGM. This calibration must occur no more than 90 minutes prior to&#xD;
           activation of the system. NOTE: Subjects will be instructed to calibrate the CGM per&#xD;
           manufacturer guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Then the system will be activated, linking the CGM and insulin pump to the computer at&#xD;
           the bedside.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A randomization schedule on the laptop will be used to determine whether the system will&#xD;
           run in PLGS+Hyper Minimization mode or PLGS-only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be blinded as to whether the system is running in PLGS+Hyper Minimization&#xD;
           mode or PLGS-only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There will not be an alarm if the pump shuts off or if automated insulin dosing occurs.&#xD;
           The CGM alarm will be set to 60 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L). When a CGM alarm occurs, the subject&#xD;
           will be asked to measure the blood glucose with a BG meter, if he/she is aware of the&#xD;
           alarm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The time period for outcome assessment each night will be from the time the system is&#xD;
           activated until it is turned off in the morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pump shut off, when it occurs, will be for up to 120 minutes in a 150-minute period, and&#xD;
           no more than 180 minutes for the entire night. Multiple instances of pump suspension can&#xD;
           occur if there are recurrent predictions of hypoglycemia during the night.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Small correction boluses of insulin will be delivered when the system predicts that&#xD;
           hyperglycemia above a pre-set threshold will occur, with insulin-on-board constraints&#xD;
           and cumulative delivery limits to minimize the likelihood of excessive insulin delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be asked to check blood glucose with the study BG meter each morning prior&#xD;
           to breakfast and enter the results using the controller software interface. The subject&#xD;
           will be instructed to contact the study physician if the morning blood glucose value is&#xD;
           &lt;60 mg/dl (3.3 mmol/L) or &gt;300 mg/dl (16.7 mmol/L). Monitoring processes detailed in&#xD;
           section 3.11 will ensure that the subject can be contacted if these values are not&#xD;
           reported as required or are out of range.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be asked to record all overnight carbohydrate intake using the controller&#xD;
           software interface.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be asked to perform periodic CGM data uploads using the controller&#xD;
           software interface. Monitoring processes will ensure that the subject can be contacted&#xD;
           if these uploads do not occur as required, or if review of an upload reveals any&#xD;
           extreme, prolonged episodes of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, or elevated morning blood&#xD;
           glucose values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the study, subjects as well as study clinicians will be asked to complete&#xD;
      a human factors usability questionnaire regarding use of the study system.&#xD;
