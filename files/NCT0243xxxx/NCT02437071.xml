  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The radiation therapy or ablation that the patient received as standard therapy treated only&#xD;
      the tumors that were radiated or ablated. Radiation therapy or ablation plus pembrolizumab&#xD;
      might lead to a stronger immune response that may control or destroy tumors that did not&#xD;
      receive radiation therapy or ablation. The purpose of this study is to find out what effects,&#xD;
      good and/or bad, pembrolizumab has on the patient, and the cancer that did not receive&#xD;
      radiation therapy or ablation.&#xD;
