  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Limiting brain death-induced organ injury through a systemic anti- inflammatory medical&#xD;
      management should allow for improvement in the quality of transplanted organs, and as a&#xD;
      result, clinical improvement in post-transplant outcomes represented by a decrease in the&#xD;
      incidence of delayed graft function (DGF) after transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aim is to evaluate the effect of C1INH (CINRYZE) as a donor pre-treatment&#xD;
      strategy to decrease systemic inflammation and decrease the incidence of DGF in Expanded&#xD;
      Criteria Donors (ECD), currently identified as donors with Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI)&#xD;
      greater than or equal to 60%.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, single-center double-blinded study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donor Pre-treatment Strategy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to identify the lowest dose that will allow an at least 80% decrease in&#xD;
      the activity of classic pathway and Mannose-Binding Lectin (MBL) pathway of complement. The&#xD;
      main objectives parallel observations in non-human primates in which animals receiving&#xD;
      kidneys from donors in which activity of both classic and MBL pathways of complement were&#xD;
      reduced by at least 50% with the use of C1 inhibitors displayed very mild or no delayed graft&#xD;
      function after transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial has specifically been designed to evaluate the beneficial effect of C1INH in&#xD;
      kidneys from deceased donors which have a high rate of delayed graft function. The selection&#xD;
      of potential donors to be part of this study will be limited to the population of donors with&#xD;
      a KDPI over 60%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 36 brain dead donors and 72 kidney recipients will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the donors with a Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI) &gt;60%, due to the fact that they&#xD;
      are considered &quot;extreme&quot; donors, are not likely to be able to donate organs other than&#xD;
      kidneys. They would certainly not be pancreas donors, and it is unlikely they would be lung&#xD;
      donors. There is a small possibility that donors with a KDPI &gt;60% could be potential liver&#xD;
      donors. In the event that a donor liver is available for transplant, we will obtain written&#xD;
      consent from the liver recipient, as we will from the kidney recipient(s) before the donor is&#xD;
      dosed with the CINRYZE/placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All donors will come from within our service area. All kidney and livers will be allocated to&#xD;
      be transplanted at the UW.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1: Collection of initial safety data prior to expanding the study to a broad cohort of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 non-randomized donors: Step 1: Two kidney only donors treated with 200 units/kg C1INH and&#xD;
      heparin at 20 units/kg/h IV maintenance until organ recovery Step 2: Two donors of both liver&#xD;
      and kidneys, treated with 200 units/kg C1INH and heparin at 20 units/kg/h IV maintenance&#xD;
      until organ recovery The 8 kidneys and 2 livers in Stage 1 will be allocated to be&#xD;
      transplanted only at UW.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2: PK Study, Safety and Outcome Data&#xD;
&#xD;
      36 donors will be randomized into 3 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Control group: standard donor management + vehicle treatment (n=12) Group 2:&#xD;
      Standard donor management + C1INH at a dose of 200 U/Kg IV single dose (n=12) Group 3:&#xD;
      Standard donor management + C1INH at a dose of 200 units/kg IV single dose and heparin at 20&#xD;
      units/kg/h IV maintenance until organ recovery (n=12)&#xD;

        If male, patient must:&#xD;

               -  Willingness to comply with the protocol procedures for the duration of the study,&#xD;

&#xD;
        The criteria for enrollment in the study was originally limited to kidney donors with KDPI&#xD;
        &gt;85%. Over the last five years however, we have only transplanted a handful of those&#xD;
        patients If we further restrict our patient pool to those who are not liver donors, our&#xD;
        pool of possible donors will become even smaller, making the study very difficult, if not&#xD;
        impossible, to complete. Furthermore, our knowledge of the pathophysiology of the&#xD;
        complement system suggests that use of C1Inhibitor will improve liver outcomes by blunting&#xD;
        the inflammatory response which can cause liver fibrosis and reperfusion injury. Since we&#xD;
        have seen no negative effects on the liver in our preliminary non-human primate data, there&#xD;
        is no need to exclude possible liver donors from our treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Therefore, in order to increase feasibility of the study, we have now expanded the trial to&#xD;
        include donors with a KDPI above 60% (rather than &gt; 85%), since the rate of DGF in&#xD;
        recipients of kidneys from KDPI between 60% and 85% is similar to the group &gt;85%. In&#xD;
        addition, we are now including liver recipients in the study, and will consent them if the&#xD;
        donor has a viable liver in addition to the kidney(s). If we were to only include patients&#xD;
        with KDPI above 85%, and kidney only donors, this trial would not be feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of an investigational drug in the 30 days before surgery.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History or presence of a medical condition or disease that in the investigator's&#xD;
