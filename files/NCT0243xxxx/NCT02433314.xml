                  benzodiazepine or other emergent initial AED treatment), according to the&#xD;
                  institution's standard of care, and;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Failed to respond to at least one second-line agent (e.g., phenytoin,&#xD;
                  fosphenytoin, valproate, phenobarbital, levetiracetam or other urgent control&#xD;
                  AEDs), according to the institution's standard of care, and;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Not previously been administered a third-line agent but have been admitted to an&#xD;
                  intensive care unit with the intent of administering at least one third-line&#xD;
                  agent for at least 24 hours; or who have previously failed zero, one or more wean&#xD;
                  attempts from third-line agents and are now on continuous intravenous infusions&#xD;
                  of one or more third-line agents and in an EEG burst or seizure suppression&#xD;
                  pattern; or who have previously failed one or more wean attempts from third-line&#xD;
                  agents and are now either not on at least one continuous infusion of a third-line&#xD;
                  agent or are on one or more continuous infusions of third-line agents but not in&#xD;
                  an EEG burst or seizure suppression pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with SRSE due to anoxic/hypoxic encephalopathy with highly malignant/&#xD;
             malignant EEG features&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children (subjects aged less than 18 years) with an encephalopathy due to an&#xD;
             underlying progressive neurological disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. a GFR low enough to warrant dialysis for whatever reason, but dialysis is not&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. severe cardiogenic or vasodilatory shock requiring two or more pressors that is&#xD;
                  not related to third-line agent use;&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. fulminant hepatic failure;&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. no reasonable expectation of recovery or life-expectancy of less than 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are being administered more than three third-line agents concomitantly or&#xD;
             in whom the qualifying wean cannot be completed per protocol&#xD;
