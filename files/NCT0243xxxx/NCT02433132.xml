    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of CF is currently based on the discovery of two CFTR gene mutations and / or a&#xD;
      positive sweat test (&gt; 60mmol / l). A significant number of patients with atypical cystic&#xD;
      fibrosis (chronic sino-pulmonary disease with a single mutation in the CFTR gene and / or a&#xD;
      test of the intermediate sweat between 30 and 60 mmol / l) undetected by these techniques are&#xD;
      behind specialized care while irreversible lung damage is already existed. Currently, the&#xD;
      measurement of nasal potential difference in vivo (DPN), which evaluates the transportation&#xD;
      of chlorine in the nasal epithelium with an electrode, is proposed for the diagnosis of&#xD;
      atypical forms. However DPN dependent nasal local conditions when analysing do not always&#xD;
      offer the possibility of concluding the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. It is necessary to&#xD;
      develop new and more reliable diagnostic tests for the detection of cases of atypical cystic&#xD;
      fibrosis. The authors propose to develop a new diagnostic technique based on the study of&#xD;
      bioelectric properties of a preparation of nasal cells of the subject obtained by brushing&#xD;
      and placed in primary culture (CCBN).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autosomal recessive, CF is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene whose nature determines the&#xD;
      clinical expression and severity of the disease affecting mainly the respiratory, digestive&#xD;
      and genital. Respiratory pathology is mainly responsible for the morbidity and mortality of&#xD;
      patients with cystic fibrosis. CFTR, which is ion channel carrying chlorine, plays an&#xD;
      essential role in respiratory disease through its involvement in the changes of surface&#xD;
      liquid covering the respiratory epithelial cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently the measurement of nasal potential difference in vivo (DPN) can cause arguments&#xD;
      electrophysiological diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (chlorine transport default) for patients&#xD;
      with atypical form but can be rendered difficult or non-interpretable by the lack of&#xD;
      cooperation of the patient (especially in the children who do not support the presence of the&#xD;
      probe into the nose) or mostly due to poor local conditions related to infectious diseases&#xD;
      rhino sinus of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is necessary to develop new and more reliable diagnostic tests for the detection of cases&#xD;
      of atypical cystic fibrosis. The study of ion transport from nasal epithelial cells collected&#xD;
      by brushing (NBC) in the diagnosis of atypical forms of cystic fibrosis is tested in this&#xD;
      trial as a new diagnostic test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will focus on three groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Of patients with cystic fibrosis adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. adult patients with atypical form&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. people who do not have cystic fibrosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on the patient group, there will be only one CCBN or CCBN and DPN or CCBN and DPN&#xD;
      and genetic analysis to verify the absence of mutation.&#xD;
