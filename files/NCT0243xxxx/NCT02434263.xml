    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is the evaluation of the performance, safety and efficacy of Hydra&#xD;
      Aortic valve in real-world patients. Following initial implantation, all patients will have&#xD;
      clinical follow up at 30 days, 3, months, 6 months and 12 months&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, prospective, non-randomized investigational study designed to&#xD;
      assess the safety and performance of the HYDRA Aortic valve and delivery system. Primary&#xD;
      endpoint for safety is the 30 day all cause mortality rate. Primary endpoint for performance&#xD;
      is the acute device success. In addition, the efficacy of the HYDRA Aortic valve and delivery&#xD;
      system will be evaluated. Up to 165 patients will be enrolled in the study in order to&#xD;
      achieve 150 subjects successfully implanted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have a clinical follow-up at 30 days, 3months, 6 months and 12 months post&#xD;
      implant. The follow-up procedure table is shown in Appendix A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient is enrolled in the study as a subject only upon signature of the informed&#xD;
      consent. All subjects will be reviewed by the Principal Investigator prior to undergoing the&#xD;
      implant procedure for the Hydra Aortic Heart Valve.&#xD;
