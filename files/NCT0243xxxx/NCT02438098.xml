      Until now there ist no systematic investigation of the pharmacokinetic parameters of&#xD;
      Rivaroxaban in obese patient undergoing bariatric surgery. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of rivaroxaban in obese&#xD;
      patients before and after bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive the day before the surgical intervention the first dose of Rivaroxaban&#xD;
      (10mg). During the following 24 hours, 9 blood samples are taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second tablet Rivaroxaban is administered on the third postoperative day, followed again&#xD;
      by 9 blood samples during the next 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All other blood samples are taken independent from this clinical trial as part of the&#xD;
      standard medical treatment during the hospitalization. The hospital stay will not be extended&#xD;
      by the study. The outpatient regular follow-up takes place one month after surgery and is&#xD;
      combined with the last study visit.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of obesity and morbid obesity is increasing worldwide and is becoming an&#xD;
      increasing medical and socioeconomic burden. Bariatric surgery leads to the most sustained&#xD;
      reduction of weight and associated co-morbidities. Obesity is a risk factor for the&#xD;
      development of venous thromboembolism and the association between obesity and postoperative&#xD;
      VTE is well established. The incidence of symptomatic DVT and PE ranges from 0%-5.4%,&#xD;
      respectively 0%-6.4% and remains uncertain. Although the overall incidence seems to be low,&#xD;
      VTE represents a significant cause of morbidity and mortality after surgery. Most&#xD;
      postdischarge VTE events occur within the first 30 days after surgery and therefore extended&#xD;
      chemoprophylaxis after hospital discharge is the standard of care and should be considered&#xD;
      especially for patients classified to be at high risk for VTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticoagulants are recommended for the prevention of VTE, but there is no consensus regarding&#xD;
      optimal method of prophylaxis. Routine perioperative use of drugs such as low-molecular&#xD;
      weight heparins (LMWHs), intermittent pneumatic compression and early mobilization are&#xD;
      currently the major accepted forms. However, there is currently no class I evidence to&#xD;
      provide guidance regarding the type or dose of antithrombotic prophylaxis after bariatric&#xD;
      surgery. For parenteral application there is for example limited evidence to guide dosing of&#xD;
      thromboprophylaxis in morbid obesity and higher dosages are necessary, because impaired&#xD;
      absorption after subcutaneous application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The knowledge of the effect of extremely high body weight on pharmacokinetic and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics parameters after bariatric surgery especially for novel orally administered&#xD;
      anticoagulants that target specific factors in the coagulation cascade is scarce. One&#xD;
      promising therapeutic option is rivaroxaban (BAY 59-7939, Rivaroxaban), an orally&#xD;
      administered direct factor Xa inhibitor that is approved for several indications in the field&#xD;
      of prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In several types of bariatric surgery procedures, such as sleeve gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y&#xD;
      gastric bypass and biliopancreatic diversion different parts of gastrointestinal tract are&#xD;
      bypassed or removed. This could affect the absorption of medications. Absorption of&#xD;
      rivaroxaban is dependent on the site of drug release in the GI tract. In a study looking at&#xD;
      administration of the crushed tablet via a tube, a 29% and 56% decrease in AUC and Cmax&#xD;
      compared to an oral tablet was reported when rivaroxaban granulate is released in the&#xD;
      proximal small intestine. The effect of altered anatomy due to RYGB on oral drug absorption&#xD;
      and bioavailability is currently unknown. Previous studies focused on drugs like metformin,&#xD;
      sertraline or tacrolimus, but they yielded conflicting results. In a case report by Mahlmann&#xD;
      et al. the absorption of rivaroxaban was immediate and not significantly impaired by&#xD;
      bariatric surgery of the upper GI tract. However, data from larger patient collectives are&#xD;
      not available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rivaroxaban is already approved for VTE prophylaxis in orthopaedic patients. Up to now, there&#xD;
      is no clinical data available regarding obese patients after bariatric surgery. To fill this&#xD;
      gap, this phase 1 clinical trial was designed with a study design that allows for&#xD;
      intra-patient comparison of the effect of the bariatric surgery regarding pharmacokinetic and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rivaroxaban as an oral anticoagulant could be an attractive option for VTE prophylaxis&#xD;
      compared to subcutaneous (LMWH) standard treatment after bariatric surgery. Especially&#xD;
      high-risk patients (high BMI, a history of DVT, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension, hormonal therapy, venous stasis disease, male gender, expected long operative&#xD;
      time or open approach, where an extended duration of thromboprophylaxis after hospital&#xD;
      discharge is recommended, an oral therapy would be attractive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until now there is no systematic investigation of pharmacokinetic parameters of rivaroxaban&#xD;
      in obese patient undergoing bariatric surgery. This phase I clinical trial offers the unique&#xD;
      opportunity to investigate PK/PD in morbidly obese patients pre and post bariatric surgery.&#xD;
      The results of this trial will help to design larger trials in this particular patient&#xD;
      population with the final goal of safe and efficient use of rivaroxaban in morbidly patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of&#xD;
      rivaroxaban in obese patients before and after bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
