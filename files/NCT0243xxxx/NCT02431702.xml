  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare effectiveness of paliperidone palmitate (PP:&#xD;
      paliperidone palmitate once-monthly and 3-month injections) versus oral antipsychotic (OAP&#xD;
      [that is oral paliperidone extended release {ER}, oral risperidone, or another OAP]) in&#xD;
      delaying time to treatment failure. The study will also evaluate changes in cognition,&#xD;
      functioning, brain intracortical myelin (ICM) volume following treatment with PP compared&#xD;
      with OAP in participants with recent-onset schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder.&#xD;

      A Prospective, matched-control, Randomized (assignment of study drug by chance), open-label,&#xD;
      flexible-dose, study in participants with recent-onset schizophrenia or schizophreniform&#xD;
      disorder to compare disease progression and disease modification following treatment with PP&#xD;
      long-acting injection (once-monthly followed by 3-month injections) or OAP (Any of the&#xD;
      following 7 OAPs are permitted: aripiprazole, haloperidol, olanzapine, paliperidone ER,&#xD;
      perphenazine, quetiapine, and risperidone). The study consists of 3 parts. Part-1 (Oral&#xD;
      Run-In Phase), Part-2 (Disease Progression) and Part-3 (Extended Disease Progression and&#xD;
      Disease Modification) with unique endpoints. Screening period will be up to 4 Weeks. Duration&#xD;
      of Parts will be as: 2 months for Part-1, 9 months for Part-2 and Part-3. All participants&#xD;
      will initially receive oral paliperidone ER or oral risperidone in Part-1. After&#xD;
      paliperidone/risperidone treatment in Part-1, participants will be randomized into 1:2 ratio&#xD;
      to receive PP or OAP in Part-2. Participants who complete Part-2 will enter into Part-3&#xD;
      wherein OAP group participants of Part-2 will be re-randomized into 1:1 ratio to OAP-OAP&#xD;
      group and OAP-PP group, and PP group will continue without further randomization. Treatment&#xD;
      failures will be evaluated in Part-2 and Part-3 of the study. Also changes in cognition,&#xD;
      functioning, brain intracortical myelin (ICM) volume will be evaluated in the study.&#xD;
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout. Healthy controls (comparable in age, sex,&#xD;
      race, and highest parental education to the treated participants) were recruited at each of&#xD;
      the 3 MRI centers as controls for the MRI machine calibration for the duration of the study.&#xD;
      These healthy controls were to undergo MRI assessments, but were not otherwise involved with&#xD;
      the study and did not receive study medication. No safety or efficacy data were collected for&#xD;
      these healthy controls.&#xD;

    <measure>Part 2 (Disease Progression): Change From Baseline in Functioning as Measured by the Personal and Social Performance (PSP) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 9</time_frame>
    <description>The Personal and Social Performance (PSP) scale assesses degree of a participant's dysfunction within 4 domains of behavior: 1) socially useful activities, 2) personal and social relationships, 3) self-care, and 4) disturbing and aggressive behavior. Each domain was assessed on a 6-point scale, from 1 (absent) to 6 (very severe) (1 = absent, 2 = mild, 3 = manifest, 4 = marked, 5 = severe, and 6 = very severe). PSP total score was calculated as sum of all the domain scores and ranges from 1 to 100. Participants with score of 71 to 100 have mild degree of difficulty; from 31 to 70, varying degrees of disability; less than or equal to 30, functioning so poorly as to require intensive supervision. Higher score indicate better performance.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 260</time_frame>
    <description>The adjusted ICM fraction score is quantified as: 1. The volume of myelinated brain tissue is measured separately on co-localized IR and proton density (PD) MRI images, by outlining the boundary between gray matter and white matter on each image. 2. ICM is calculated from the difference of &quot;IR volume minus PD volume&quot;. 3. ICM is then expressed as a fraction of the total intracranial volume (ICM divided by intracranial volume). 4. The ICM fraction is then adjusted for effects of age, gender, and race/ethnicity in the sample of treated participants and healthy controls. A decrease in the adjusted ICM fraction score may be a sign of disease progression.</description>

ICM is calculated from the difference of &quot;IR volume minus PD volume&quot;. 3. ICM is then expressed as a fraction of the total intracranial volume (ICM divided by intracranial volume). 4. The ICM fraction is then adjusted for effects of age, gender, and race/ethnicity in the sample of treated participants and healthy controls. A decrease in the adjusted ICM fraction score may be a sign of disease progression.</description>

    <description>Participants who will complete Part-1 will be randomized to receive oral Paliperidone Palmitate (PP) treatment. Participants will receive 5 doses of PP1M (paliperidone palmitate once-monthly injection). First dose at a starting dose of 234 mg on Day 1 and thereafter second dose in second week and then, every month up to Day 92. Participants will be subsequently switched to PP3M (paliperidone palmitate three-monthly injection) following a minimum of 5 injections of PP1M. Participants receiving PP3M may go back to treatment with PP1M (monthly injections of 78, 117, 156 or 234 mg, flexibly dosed) for further dose adjustment or for the duration of the study with the approval of the medical monitor.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>A total of 337 participants were enrolled out of which 273 were randomized and received study medication while 64 did not and served as healthy controls. Healthy controls underwent MRI assessments as controls for the MRI machine calibration. They did not receive study medication and no safety or efficacy data were collected.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>To ensure that the total number of participants equal 337, another group is created called &quot;Healthy Controls&quot; to the table below and their completion status is reported in Part 1 and not in other parts.</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Part 1-Run-in: Oral Antipsychotics (OAP)</title>
          <description>All participants received paliperidone extended Release (ER) 1.5 to 12 milligrams (mg) or risperidone 1 to 6 mg once daily orally for 2 months. Participants who tolerated paliperidone ER/risperidone but found it inadequately efficacious after treatment for an adequate duration at an adequate dosage (per clinical judgment), may be switched to another protocol-specified OAP at the discretion of the investigator.</description>
        </group>
        <group group_id="P2">
          <title>Part 2-Paliperidone Palmitate (PP)</title>
          <description>Participants who completed Part 1 with acceptable run-in dosages were eligible to enter Part 2. Participants who were randomized to the PP treatment group received a minimum of 5 doses of PP1M with fixed initial doses of 234 mg on Day 1 and 156 mg on Day 8, followed by 3 injections of flexible doses. On Day 120, participants received PP3M for the remaining 9 months.</description>

          <title>Part 2-OAP</title>
          <description>Participants who completed Part 1 with acceptable run-in dosages were eligible to enter Part 2. Participants who completed Part 1 were randomized to OAP treatment group and continued their OAP treatment from Part 1 for another 9 months (up to Day 260 of Part 2).</description>

          <title>Part 3- OAP to PP (or Delayed-Start PP) (Disease Modification)</title>
          <description>Participants who completed Part 2 (with OAP treatment) and who were eligible based on matched criteria identified in Part 1 were re-randomized to receive PP treatment for additional 9 months (up to Day 260). PP treatment includes PP1M or PP3M. Participants subsequently switched to PP3M following a minimum of 5 injections of PP1M.</description>

        <title>Part 3 (Extended Disease Progression [EDP]): Change From Baseline in Cognition as Measured by the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) Composite Score</title>
        <description>The MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery is an instrument that contains 10 tests to measure cognitive performance in 7 cognitive domains: speed processing, attention/vigilance, working memory, verbal learning, visual learning, reasoning and problem solving, and social cognition. The composite score combines the individual scores of the 10 tests and scores them on a normative scale to derive a T-score and composites scores. The range of T-scores for a normal control population is between 0 to 100 with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. Higher scores indicate better cognitive functioning.</description>

          <description>The MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery is an instrument that contains 10 tests to measure cognitive performance in 7 cognitive domains: speed processing, attention/vigilance, working memory, verbal learning, visual learning, reasoning and problem solving, and social cognition. The composite score combines the individual scores of the 10 tests and scores them on a normative scale to derive a T-score and composites scores. The range of T-scores for a normal control population is between 0 to 100 with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. Higher scores indicate better cognitive functioning.</description>

        <description>The Personal and Social Performance (PSP) scale assesses degree of a participant's dysfunction within 4 domains of behavior: 1) socially useful activities, 2) personal and social relationships, 3) self-care, and 4) disturbing and aggressive behavior. Each domain was assessed on a 6-point scale, from 1 (absent) to 6 (very severe) (1 = absent, 2 = mild, 3 = manifest, 4 = marked, 5 = severe, and 6 = very severe). PSP total score was calculated as sum of all the domain scores and ranges from 1 to 100. Participants with score of 71 to 100 have mild degree of difficulty; from 31 to 70, varying degrees of disability; less than or equal to 30, functioning so poorly as to require intensive supervision. Higher score indicate better performance.</description>

The volume of myelinated brain tissue is measured separately on co-localized IR and proton density (PD) MRI images, by outlining the boundary between gray matter and white matter on each image. 2. ICM is calculated from the difference of &quot;IR volume minus PD volume&quot;. 3. ICM is then expressed as a fraction of the total intracranial volume (ICM divided by intracranial volume). 4. The ICM fraction is then adjusted for effects of age, gender, and race/ethnicity in the sample of treated participants and healthy controls. A decrease in the adjusted ICM fraction score may be a sign of disease progression.</description>

          <title>Part 2 (Disease Progression): Change From Baseline in Social Cognition Score: MCCB Domain</title>
          <description>MCCB measures cognitive function across cognitive domains and is comprised of 10 independent tests assessing 7 cognitive domains (speed of processing, attention/vigilance, working memory, verbal learning, visual learning, reasoning and problem solving, and social cognition). A subset of the MCCB cognitive domain was used to assess social cognition score of participants. The range of social cognition score T-scores for a normal control population is between 0 to 100 with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. Higher scores indicate better cognitive functioning.</description>

        <title>Part 2 (Disease Progression): Number of Participants With Change From Baseline in Severity of Psychotic Symptoms, as Measured by Clinician-Rated Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity Scale (CRDPSS)</title>
        <description>The CRDPSS is an 8-item measure that assesses the severity of mental health symptoms that are important across psychotic disorders, including delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, abnormal psychomotor behavior, negative symptoms. Each item on the measure is rated on a 5-point scale (0=none; 1=equivocal; 2=present, but mild; 3=present and moderate; and 4=present and severe). Total Score is taken as summation. A higher score indicates a more severe condition. Worsened or improved is defined as increase or decrease compared to baseline.</description>

        <description>The Personal and Social Performance (PSP) scale assesses degree of a participant's dysfunction within 4 domains of behavior: 1) socially useful activities, 2) personal and social relationships, 3) self-care, and 4) disturbing and aggressive behavior. Each domain was assessed on a 6-point scale, from 1 (absent) to 6 (very severe) (1 = absent, 2 = mild, 3 = manifest, 4 = marked, 5 = severe, and 6 = very severe). PSP total score was calculated as sum of all the domain scores and ranges from 1 to 100. Participants with score of 71 to 100 have mild degree of difficulty; from 31 to 70, varying degrees of disability; less than or equal to 30, functioning so poorly as to require intensive supervision. Higher score indicate better performance.</description>

        <title>Part 3 (EDP): Change From Baseline in Adjusted Intracortical Myelin Fraction Score as Measured by Inversion Recovery (IR) and Spin Echo Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</title>
        <description>The adjusted ICM fraction score is quantified as: 1. The volume of myelinated brain tissue is measured separately on co-localized IR and proton density (PD) MRI images, by outlining the boundary between gray matter and white matter on each image. 2. ICM is calculated from the difference of &quot;IR volume minus PD volume&quot;. 3. ICM is then expressed as a fraction of the total intracranial volume (ICM divided by intracranial volume). 4. The ICM fraction is then adjusted for effects of age, gender, and race/ethnicity in the sample of treated participants and healthy controls. A decrease in the adjusted ICM fraction score may be a sign of disease progression.</description>

The range of verbal learning score T-scores for a normal control population is between 0 to 100 with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. Higher scores indicate better cognitive functioning.</description>

          <description>The Clinical Global Impression Severity (CGI-S) rating scale is used to rate the severity of a participant's overall clinical condition on a 7 point scale. The total score ranges from 1 to 7, where 1 is equivalent to &quot;Normal, not at all ill&quot; and a rating of 7 is equivalent to &quot;Among the most extremely ill participants&quot;. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>

        <title>Part 3 (EDP): Number of Participants With Change From Baseline in Severity of Psychotic Symptoms, as Measured by CRDPSS</title>
        <description>The CRDPSS is an 8-item measure that assesses the severity of mental health symptoms that are important across psychotic disorders, including delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, abnormal psychomotor behavior, negative symptoms. Each item on the measure is rated on a 5-point scale (0=none; 1=equivocal; 2=present, but mild; 3=present and moderate; and 4=present and severe). Total Score is taken as summation. A higher score indicates a more severe condition. Worsened or improved is defined as increase or decrease compared to baseline.</description>

        <title>Part 3 (Disease Modification): Personal and Social Performance (PSP) Total Observed Score</title>
        <description>The Personal and Social Performance (PSP) scale assesses degree of a participant's dysfunction within 4 domains of behavior: 1) socially useful activities, 2) personal and social relationships, 3) self-care, and 4) disturbing and aggressive behavior. Score ranges from 1 to 100, divided into 10 equal intervals to rate degree of difficulty (1 = absent, 2 = mild, 3 = manifest, 4 = marked, 5 = severe, and 6 = very severe) in each of the 4 domains. Based on 4 domains there will be 1 transformed total score. Participants with score of 71 to 100 have mild degree of difficulty; from 31 to 70, varying degrees of disability; less than or equal to 30, functioning so poorly as to require intensive supervision.</description>

        <title>Part 3 (Disease Modification): Change From Baseline in Adjusted Intracortical Myelin Fraction Score as Measured by Inversion Recovery (IR) and Spin Echo Magnetic Resonance Imaging (SE MRI)</title>
        <description>The adjusted ICM fraction score is quantified as: 1. The volume of myelinated brain tissue is measured separately on co-localized IR and proton density (PD) MRI images, by outlining the boundary between gray matter and white matter on each image. 2. ICM is calculated from the difference of &quot;IR volume minus PD volume&quot;. 3. ICM is then expressed as a fraction of the total intracranial volume (ICM divided by intracranial volume). 4. The ICM fraction is then adjusted for effects of age, gender, and race/ethnicity in the sample of treated participants and healthy controls. A decrease in the adjusted ICM fraction score may be a sign of disease progression.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>The treatment failure (TF) definition for this study was very broad. For example, the TF reason, supplementation with another antipsychotic, was biased against PP as supplementing with oral paliperidone or risperidone was considered a TF which is usual clinical practice. Supplementation was the most common first TF criteria for PP. A designated individual of the subject was a requirement for study inclusion which may have also contributed to increased OAP adherence in the beginning of the study.</limitations_and_caveats>
