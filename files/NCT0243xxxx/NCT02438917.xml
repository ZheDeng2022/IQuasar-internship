      Chronic liver injury leads to the accumulation of proteins in the liver that form dense&#xD;
      scars. Liver scar formation is typically a slow process that leads to major organ damage and&#xD;
      loss of function over the course of many years. During scar formation the extracellular&#xD;
      matrix in the liver changes. The type and quantity of extracellular collagen and other&#xD;
      proteins change during tissue remodeling. Some of these changes can be detected by analyzing&#xD;
      factors present in blood. Because of the lengthy time course, changes in the rate of liver&#xD;
      scar formation and regression are very difficult measure; however, accurate measurements are&#xD;
      needed in order to conduct trials of interventions aimed at preventing scar formation and/or&#xD;
      promotion scar regression. Current methods have sub-optimal specificity and selectivity. The&#xD;
      long term objective of the study is to identify serum proteins that can be used to accurately&#xD;
      estimate rates of liver fibrosis progression and regression. The project focusses on a novel&#xD;
      methodology that uses stable isotope labeling with deuterated water, D2O, to tag&#xD;
      newly-synthesized proteins. Mass spectroscopy is used to identify individual proteins and to&#xD;
      quantify the ratio of labeled protein to total protein. This ratio provides information about&#xD;
      the rate of synthesis of the protein of interest. This method will be applied to specimens&#xD;
      from patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who are about to begin HCV treatment.&#xD;
      Treatment is known to reduce liver inflammation and collagen content.&#xD;

      Chronic liver injury leads to the accumulation of proteins in the liver that form dense&#xD;
      scars. Liver scar formation is typically a slow process that leads to major organ damage and&#xD;
      loss of function over the course of many years. During scar formation the extracellular&#xD;

      methodology that uses stable isotope labeling with deuterated water, D2O, to tag&#xD;
      newly-synthesized proteins. Mass spectroscopy is used to identify individual proteins and to&#xD;
      quantify the ratio of labeled protein to total protein. This ratio provides information about&#xD;
      the rate of synthesis of the protein of interest. This method will be applied to specimens&#xD;
      from patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who are about to begin HCV treatment.&#xD;
      Treatment is known to reduce liver inflammation and collagen content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main questions being addressed are whether the regression of scar in the liver can be&#xD;
      predicted based on the half-life of serum proteins and what is the identity of the proteins&#xD;
      that are the best indicators of liver scar formation and regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long term goal of the study is to develop a non-invasive test that can be used to&#xD;
      estimate the extent of liver fibrosis and the rate of liver fibrosis generation and&#xD;
      regression. Such a marker could be used to test drugs that promote fibrosis regression and/or&#xD;
      prevent fibrogenesis and it could also be used to provide patients and healthcare providers&#xD;
      with information about the extent of liver scarring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research is being done around the globe to determine develop innovative methods to accurately&#xD;
      determine liver status. A metabolic labeling method will be tested in this project. This&#xD;
      approach is based on the concept that liver status can be determined by measuring the ratio&#xD;
      of newly-synthesized/pre-existing proteins. Patients will be given &quot;heavy water&quot; to drink.&#xD;
      Heavy water contains D20. Deuterium is a stable isotope of hydrogen. Deuterium is not&#xD;
      radioactive. It has been given to many patients and is considered to be entirely safe when&#xD;
      administered according to the protocol that will be used in this study. Proteins that are&#xD;
      synthesized during D20 labeling contain D20. Mass spectrometry is used to determine the&#xD;
      percentages of scar proteins (and other indicator proteins) that are newly-synthesized. The&#xD;
      analysis can be performed on a variety of tissues and bodily fluids. In this study,&#xD;
      measurements will be made on blood, saliva, and urine samples from all the participants.&#xD;
      Study subjects will be given the option of undergoing liver biopsy. The D20 content of biopsy&#xD;
      tissue will be determined for the patients who elect this option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study group for this investigation is comprised of patients with chronic hepatitis C&#xD;
      virus (HCV) infection who are about to begin HCV treatment. It is well established that HCV&#xD;
      treatment reduces the amount of inflammation and scar in the liver. New treatments for HCV&#xD;
      are far more effective and less toxic than earlier treatments. The treatment-induced changes&#xD;
      in inflammation and hepatic scarring will impact the ratio of proteins in the metabolic&#xD;
      labeling study. The rate of synthesis of scar proteins will go down and the ratio of&#xD;
      new/pre-existing protein will change. Metabolic labeling data will be compared to other data&#xD;
      about liver status, such as values of serum markers, liver stiffness measurements, and liver&#xD;
      histopathology (when available).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research will be performed at the Mount Sinai Medical Center, with coded, but de-identified&#xD;
      specimens analyzed at Kinemed Patients initiating treatment for HCV infection are the source&#xD;
      of potential subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final study group is expected to include 40 subjects. We expect about 2/3 of subjects who&#xD;
      are approached to agree to participate and to sign the consent document. We expect 90% of the&#xD;
      40 subjects to complete the first 6 months of the study and we expect 80% to complete the&#xD;
      entire study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center study The duration of an individual subject's participation in the&#xD;
      study: 36 months (including all follow up) The duration anticipated to enroll all study&#xD;
      subjects: 6 months&#xD;
