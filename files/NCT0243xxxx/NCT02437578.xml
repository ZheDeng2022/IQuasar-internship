      Today, it is evident that vitamin D has more widespread effects than the classical actions&#xD;
      related to bone mineralization and calcium homeostasis. Vitamin D deficiency results in&#xD;
      impaired reproductive performance in various species of animals, and recently the&#xD;
      investigators have shown that the Vitamin D receptor (VDR), activating (CYP2R1, CYP27A1,&#xD;
      CYP27B1) and inactivating (CYP24A1) enzymes are expressed in the human testis, epididymis,&#xD;
      seminal vesicle, prostate and spermatozoa. Functional studies showed that activated vitamin D&#xD;
      increases intracellular calcium and sperm motility in mature spermatozoa, and hence may be&#xD;
      important not only for spermatogenesis but also for sperm function. Any test that might&#xD;
      assist in guiding the treatment of the infertile couple would be beneficial both for most&#xD;
      infertile couples and the society in general. The fact that vitamin D may play a role for&#xD;
      human semen quality are now being tested clinically. If vitamin D supplementation proves&#xD;
      efficient this opens for the first time for a causal, safe and cheap treatment of at least&#xD;
      some cases of &quot;idiopathic&quot; impaired semen quality. This may also have consequences in the in&#xD;
      vitro setting as activated vitamin D may be used to select high quality sperm during assisted&#xD;
      reproductive techniques. The presence of the vitamin D receptor and vitamin D metabolizing&#xD;
      enzyme CYP24A1 in particular is able to discriminate spermatozoa from normal and infertile&#xD;
      men. CYP24A1 is expressed at the annulus of normal sperm, but it is virtually absent from&#xD;
      spermatozoa from infertile men. This indicates that CYP24A1 expression may assist in&#xD;
      predicting the chance of success by using insemination (IUI), IVF or ICSI. CYP24A1 expression&#xD;
      is induced by activated vitamin D, which indicates that other VDR activated genes also may&#xD;
      serve as positive predictive markers of fertility. In addition, vitamin D metabolites and&#xD;
      other factors in the female reproductive tract will be measured to determine if they alone or&#xD;
      in combination with other markers can determine whether the best solution for the infertile&#xD;
      couple would be to do IUI, IVF, or ICSI. The suggested clinical trial may therefore be able&#xD;
      to evaluate several secondary endpoints in addition to CYP24A1 in our search for predictive&#xD;
      markers for fertilization. For instance several biomarkers in serum, seminal plasma or&#xD;
      follicular fluid in conjunction with genetic polymorphisms in several genes important for&#xD;
      reproductive function.&#xD;

      Background Today, it is evident that vitamin D has more widespread effects than the classical&#xD;
      actions related to bone mineralization and calcium homeostasis. Vitamin D deficiency results&#xD;
      in impaired reproductive performance in various species of animals, and recently the&#xD;
      investigators have shown that the vitamin D receptor (VDR), activating (CYP2R1, CYP27A1,&#xD;
      CYP27B1) and inactivating (CYP24A1) enzymes are expressed in the human testis, epididymis,&#xD;
      seminal vesicle, prostate and spermatozoa. Functional studies showed that activated vitamin D&#xD;
      increases intracellular calcium and sperm motility in mature spermatozoa, and hence may be&#xD;
      important not only for spermatogenesis but also for sperm function. A cross sectional study&#xD;
      of 300 young healthy Danish men showed that men with lower levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin&#xD;
      D have significantly lower number of normally developed and motile spermatozoa. Hitherto,&#xD;
      most cases of male infertility have been classified as &quot;idiopathic&quot;, and infertile couples&#xD;
      have been referred to symptomatic treatment at infertility clinics. These fertility&#xD;
      treatments are often physically demanding for the female partner as well as expensive for the&#xD;
      health care system. Any test that might assist in guiding the treatment of the infertile&#xD;
      couple would be beneficial both for the infertile couples and the society in general. Our&#xD;
      findings that vitamin D may play a role for human semen quality are now being tested&#xD;
      clinically. If vitamin D supplementation proves efficient this opens for the first time for a&#xD;
      causal, safe and cheap treatment of at least some cases of &quot;idiopathic&quot; impaired semen&#xD;
      quality. This may have consequences as vitamin D may be used to select high quality sperm&#xD;
      during assisted reproductive techniques. The presence of the vitamin D receptor and vitamin D&#xD;
      metabolizing enzymes in a particular CYP24A1 is able to discriminate sperm from normal and&#xD;
      infertile men. CYP24A1 is expressed at the annulus of normal sperm but is virtually absent&#xD;
      from spermatozoa from infertile men. This indicates that CYP24A1 may be used as a marker to&#xD;
      discriminate between good and unhealthy sperm and may therefore serve as a predictive&#xD;
      clinical marker for fertility. This indicates that CYP24A1 expression also may assist in&#xD;
      predicting the chance of success by using insemination (IUI), IVF or ICSI. CYP24A1 expression&#xD;
      is induced by activated vitamin D through the VDR, which indicates that other VDR activated&#xD;
      genes also may serve as positive predictive markers of fertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the simple use of VDR, CYP24A1 and other vitamin D regulated genes in human&#xD;
      sperm as clinical markers, it is also important to determine the function of vitamin D in&#xD;
      reproduction. In order to understand this, it is important to determine the concentration of&#xD;
      vitamin D metabolites in the male and female reproductive tract. For instance if vitamin D&#xD;
      metabolites are undetectable in the male reproductive tract but measurable in the female&#xD;
      reproductive tract then it may be important for signaling to the capacitated (activated)&#xD;
      spermatozoa. The different vitamin D metabolites and other factors in the female reproductive&#xD;
      tract will be measured to determine if they alone or in combinaton with other markers may be&#xD;
      good predictors of the success following IUI, IVF, or ICSI treatment. The suggested clinical&#xD;
      trial may therefore be able to evaluate several secondary endpoints in addition to CYP24A1 in&#xD;
      our search for predictive markers for fertilization. For instance several biomarkers in&#xD;
      serum, seminal plasma or follicular fluid in conjunction with known polymorphisms in several&#xD;
      genes important for reproductive function. For instance genetic variation in FSH signaling.&#xD;
      Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to genes encoding the FSHβ subunit (FSHB) and&#xD;
      the FSH receptor (FSHR) affect FSH production (FSHB c.-211 G&gt;T) and sensitivity/expression of&#xD;
      its receptor in vitro (FSHR c.2039A&gt;G &amp; FSHR c.-29G&gt;A). FSHR c.2039A&gt;G, but not FSHR&#xD;
      c.-29G&gt;A, is associated with increased FSH levels in adult women, while there are conflicting&#xD;
      results on FSHB c.-211 G&gt;T (7;8). May these polymorphisms and other specific polymorphisms&#xD;
      affect male and female fertility potential, semen quality and reproductive hormones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SETTING, SCIENTIFIC PLAN AND RECRUITMENT Participants will be included among infertile&#xD;
      couples referred for IUI, IVF or ICSI at Dansk fertilitetsklinik. The design is a&#xD;
      prospective, blinded, single center cohort study. The investigation of all samples will be&#xD;
      blinded since investigators have no information about the clinical data, treatment&#xD;
      failure/succes. all participants will be followed until 9 months after their treatment to&#xD;
      evaluate live birth rate, abortions etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANTS All referred infertile couples will be invited to participate, however both&#xD;
      partners should be &gt; 18 years and the women &lt; 43 years old. women using donorinsemination&#xD;
      will also be included. Anticipated 800-1000 IUI and 400 IVF/ICSI will be conducted at the&#xD;
      clinic in the study period. The investigators assume that up to 600 IUI and 200 IVF/ICSI wish&#xD;
      to participate. Thus, 800 treatments is the target for inclusion in the study. The&#xD;
      investigators expect a small retraction rate (&lt; 20) because of high motivation and no adverse&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSIS Reproductive hormones, genetic analyses, endocrine disrupters and growth factors&#xD;
      will be analyzed at dept. of GR,Rigshospitalet and calcium regulators including vitamin D&#xD;
      metabolites at Holbæk hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION AND STATISTICS The power estimate is based on the published data on&#xD;
      CYP24A1 as a positive marker of semen quality. The association between clinical pregnancy and&#xD;
      CYP24A1 is estimated to be comparable with the association with sperm motility. This imply&#xD;
      that N=600 IUI will be enough to evaluate the effect of CYP24A1 as a marker of pregnancy and&#xD;
      live birth rate because the investigators estimate that at least 12% will have a positive&#xD;
      pregnancy test. When the inital collection of raw semen/percoll separated sperm and data have&#xD;
      been completed an additional amount of clinical observations will be obtained after 9 months&#xD;
      on live birth rate, abortions etc. Secondary analyses on the putative association between&#xD;
      clinical endpoints and the expression of VDR and other Vitamin D regulated genesin sperm will&#xD;
      be investigated on a randomly selected subset of samples N=300. All the listed genetic&#xD;
      analyses will be conducted on all men and all the women with DNA. Follicular fluid will be&#xD;
      collected during IVF or ICSI when there is no contamination with blood. Analyses of different&#xD;
      markers in the follicular fluid and cells will be associated with oocyte quality, pregnancy&#xD;
      and live birth rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICS AND SIDE EFFECTS All the patients will have finished their inital visit and&#xD;
      investigations, before they are invited to participate in the study. The loss of spermatozoa&#xD;
      for each man as a result of making the cytospin will not influence the successrate of IUI,&#xD;
      IVF or ICSI because the investigators will take less than 2.5% of the sperm pool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PUBLICATION OF RESULTS All results, positive or negative will be submitted to peer reviewed&#xD;
      scientific journals. Data will successively be obtained and transferred to a statistical&#xD;
      database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predefined subgroup analyses Female age, sperm concentration, TTP, BMI, expression of&#xD;
      CYP24A1/VDR in sperm, raw semen verus percoll separated, serum vitamin D levels and the&#xD;
      listed genetic polymorphisms under secondary endpoints.&#xD;
