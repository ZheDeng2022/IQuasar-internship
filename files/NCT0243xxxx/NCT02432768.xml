      Background: Patients with the sugar metabolism disorder, Glycogen Storage Disease Type V,&#xD;
      have insufficient breakdown of sugar stored as, glycogen, within the cells. The investigators&#xD;
      know from previous studies with McArdle patients, that they not only have a reduced sugar&#xD;
      metabolism, both also have problems in increasing their fat metabolism during exercise to&#xD;
      fully compensate for the energy deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies on Triheptanoin diet used in patients with other metabolic diseases have shown that&#xD;
      Triheptanoin can increase metabolism of both fat and sugar. In these patients, Triheptanoin&#xD;
      has had a positive effect on the physical performance and has reduces the level of symptoms&#xD;
      experienced by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To investigate the effect of treatment with the dietary oil, Triheptanoin, in patients&#xD;
      with McArdle disease on exercise capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 20-30 adult patients will be recruited through Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen,&#xD;
      Denmark, Hopital Pitié-Sapêtrière in Paris, France and through The University of Texas&#xD;
      Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pre-experimental testing (1 day):&#xD;
&#xD;
           Baseline blood samples are collected to obtain baseline values of safety parameters:&#xD;
           Plasma-acylcarnitines, free fatty acids and creatine kinase.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects perform a max-test to determine their VO2max&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment period #1 (2 weeks):&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects follow a diet consuming a dietary treatment oil. Neither patients nor members&#xD;
           of the study group know who receive which type of oil.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Washout period (1 week):&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects receive no treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Treatment period #2 (2 weeks):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who received Triheptanoin oil in the first treatment period, now receive placebo oil&#xD;
      and vice versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments: Before and after each treatment periods, subjects perform a 30-minutes exercise&#xD;
      test on a cycle ergometer, comprising of 20-22 minutes of constant load exercise and 6-8&#xD;
      minutes increasing load to peak. Subjects will complete a Fatigue Severity Scale&#xD;
      questionnaire and metabolic products will be measured in blood and urine.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will investigate the treatment potential of the drug Triheptanoin in patients&#xD;
      with the inborn defect in glycogen metabolism, McArdle Disease. There is currently no&#xD;
      treatment available for this group of patients. The condition leads to intolerance to&#xD;
      physical exercise with a risk of developing severe cramps and contractures followed by muscle&#xD;
      damage and acute kidney failure. Also one third of the patients develop progressive muscle&#xD;
      weakness and wasting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The McArdle patients have an inherited defect in the enzyme, myofosforylase, an important&#xD;
      link in the glycogenolysis within skeletal muscle. As a consequence, the patients lack&#xD;
      substrates for glycolysis to fuel muscle work (1). The investigators have previously shown&#xD;
      that patients with McArdle disease are unable to increase fat metabolism enough to compensate&#xD;
      for the energy insufficiency that occurs in these patients in response to exercise (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A key limitation to exercise in McArdle disease is the reduced production of pyruvate,&#xD;
      causing depletion of intermediates in the Citric Acid Cycle (CAC). Triheptanoin is a&#xD;
      triglyceride of glycerol and three 7-carbon fatty acid chains (heptanoate). The breakdown of&#xD;
      odd-number carbon fatty acids, such as heptanoate, generates CAC-intermediates. Triheptanoin&#xD;
      can therefore potentially boost the flux through the CAC and increase the ATP and energy&#xD;
      generation in the cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In other patients with inborn errors of metabolism, treatment with daily Triheptanoin&#xD;
      supplement can increase metabolism of both fat and glucose. Triheptanoin treatment has&#xD;
      reduced the symptom frequency and increased exercise tolerance and physical performance in&#xD;
      these patients (3,4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of Triheptanoin on exercise performance&#xD;
      and tolerance and frequency of symptoms in patients with McArdle disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be designed as a double blinded placebo controlled cross-over study. During a&#xD;
      5 week trial period each study patient will go through a 2 week treatment period, a 1 week&#xD;
      wash-out period without treatment followed by another 2 week treatment period. In one&#xD;
      treatment period, the patient takes a daily dietary oil supplement containing Triheptanoin&#xD;
      and in the other period, the oil contains regular safflower oil (placebo). Both Triheptanoin&#xD;
      and placebo oil is manufactured, packed and handed out by the manufacturer, Ultragenyx&#xD;
      Pharmaceuticals Inc. in a way that neither patients, nor the investigators will know in which&#xD;
      period, which treatment is given to which patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will meet at the laboratory for assessments on 5 occasions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening visit: Patients perform a peak exercise test on a cycle ergometer wearing a&#xD;
           mask that can measure oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange rates. Patients exercise with&#xD;
           increasing workload until exhaustion to find their maximal oxidative capacity and&#xD;
           maximal workload&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test days 1-4: On one test day before and one after each treatment period, the patients&#xD;
           perform a 30-minutes exercise test on a cycle ergometer working at a constant moderate&#xD;
           intensity for 20-22 minutes followed by a 6-8 minutes stepwise increase to peak&#xD;
           workload. Blood samples will be taken before, during and after exercise to measure&#xD;
           concentrations of metabolic products. Patients report their current feeling of fatigue&#xD;
           in a Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS-questionnaire)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total number of 21-28 patients will be included in the study across three trial sites. From&#xD;
      the Danish cohort of McArdle Patients; 5-8 patients will be included and from the French&#xD;
      cohort; 8-10 patients will be included and from the 8-10 American patients will be included.&#xD;
