  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing surgery often receive paralytic agents (or neuromuscular blocking agents&#xD;
      (NMBAs)) to facilitate the procedure. At the end of surgery, the effects NMBAs are reversed&#xD;
      with a drug called neostigmine. The use of neostigmine significantly reduces the risk that a&#xD;
      patient will be left with muscle weakness in the recovery room. Many anesthesiologists&#xD;
      routinely use neostigmine because postoperative muscle weakness may lead to adverse events&#xD;
      after surgery. Other anesthesiologists do not routinely administer neostigmine in the&#xD;
      operating room because of concerns about potential side effects. Surprisingly, some&#xD;
      investigators have reported that neostigmine-induced muscle weakness may occur if the drug is&#xD;
      given when the effects of the NMBAs have completely worn off. In contrast, other&#xD;
      investigators have not observed this side effect when neostigmine was given at the end of&#xD;
      surgery. The aim of this study is to determine whether neostigmine use is associated with&#xD;
      muscle weakness when it is given at the time of nearly complete recovery from NMBAs. Muscle&#xD;
      strength will be measured using a sensitive monitor (TOF-Watch-SX) and through an examination&#xD;
      of the patient for evidence of muscle weakness. Patients will also be evaluated how they&#xD;
      recover from anesthesia and surgery.&#xD;

      120 patients will be enrolled in this randomized clinical trial. Patients will be assigned,&#xD;
      via a computer-generated randomized table, to either a neostigmine group or a no neostigmine&#xD;
      group. Patients in the neostigmine group will receive neostigmine 40 µg/kg at the end of the&#xD;
      surgical procedure when TOF ratios have recovered to 0.9 or greater. Patients in the no&#xD;
      neostigmine group will be administered saline (control) at the time of neuromuscular&#xD;
      recovery. Patients with TOF ratios &lt; 0.9 will be excluded from either study cohort. These&#xD;
      subjects will be administered neostigmine 50 µg/kg at the conclusion of surgery. The same&#xD;
      postoperative data (see below) will be recorded in this group as will be collected in the two&#xD;
      study cohorts in order to determine the characteristics of patients not achieving spontaneous&#xD;
      recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic care will be standardized in both study groups. Patients will be induced with&#xD;
      propofol 1-2 mg/kg, fentanyl 100 µg/kg, and rocuronium as the NMBA (1 X ed 95 dose). No&#xD;
      further rocuronium will be administered unless requested by the surgeon. Clinicians will be&#xD;
      instructed to manage neuromuscular blockade so that full recovery of muscle strength is&#xD;
      present at the end of the surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuromuscular blockade in the operating room will be quantified with the TOF-Watch-SX, an&#xD;
      FDA-approved quantitative monitoring device. After induction of anesthesia, baseline data&#xD;
      will be collected. A 5-second 50 Hz tetanic stimulation will be applied to reduce the time&#xD;
      required to achieve baseline signal stabilization. After signal stability is achieved, the&#xD;
      TOF-Watch will be calibrated and then a baseline TOF value recorded. Rocuronium will then be&#xD;
      administered and the oral endotracheal tube placed 2-4 minutes later. Neuromuscular blockade&#xD;
      will be managed to allow spontaneous recovery of neuromuscular function to occur, with the&#xD;
      goal of reaching a TOF ratio of ≥ 0.9 at the end of the surgical procedure. At the time when&#xD;
      neostigmine is typically administered, one of two syringes will be attached to the&#xD;
      intravenous line, and the clear solution (neostigmine or saline) given. These syringes will&#xD;
      be prepared prior to the end of surgery. For patients in the in the neostigmine group, 40&#xD;
      µg/kg of neostigmine (with an appropriate dose of glycopyrrolate) will be drawn up into the&#xD;
      syringe and labeled accordingly. For patients in the no neostigmine group, an equal volume of&#xD;
      saline will be drawn into a syringe, and a neostigmine label applied to the syringe. Both the&#xD;
      neostigmine and saline solutions are clear and indistinguishable (to be prepared by&#xD;
      pharmacy). Thereafter, all data collection will be obtained by research assistants blinded to&#xD;
      group assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately prior to neostigmine or saline administration, TOF ratios will be recorded, and&#xD;
      then the syringe attached to the intravenous line and the solution injected. Train-of-four&#xD;
      ratios will then be recorded every 12 seconds until the time of tracheal extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During transport from the operating room to the PACU, a research assistant will observe&#xD;
      oxygen saturation levels, and the lowest value recorded. Oxygenation by pulse oximeter will&#xD;
      also be monitored and recorded for the first 30 minutes of the PACU admission (every 1 minute&#xD;
      via the PACU monitoring system). The need for addition oxygen therapy at any time following&#xD;
      extubation will be noted. During this same time period (from extubation until 30 minutes&#xD;
      after the PACU arrival) patients will be carefully observed for any evidence of airway&#xD;
      obstruction or need for maneuvers to maintain a patent airway. This data will be recorded by&#xD;
      the research assistant and the PACU nursing staff. In addition, 15 minutes after the PACU&#xD;
      admission, subjects will be examined for 11 signs and 16 symptoms of muscle weakness. This&#xD;
      examination will be performed by the blinded research assistant. The times required to&#xD;
      achieve discharge criteria and actual PACU discharge will be recorded.&#xD;
