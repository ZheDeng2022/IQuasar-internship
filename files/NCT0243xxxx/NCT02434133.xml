      The investigators proposed study is the first of its kind. The investigators will measure&#xD;
      measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis antibodies in patients on the&#xD;
      current IBD treatment modalities and compare the vaccine antibody concentrations and&#xD;
      correlate them with time since immunization.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tetanus and diphtheria have become rare diseases because of widespread immunization that&#xD;
      began during World War II. The percentage of people who got pertussis (whooping cough) also&#xD;
      went down after vaccination, but large outbreaks have occurred over the past decade. Measles,&#xD;
      mumps, rubella (German measles) and varicella (chicken pox) are illnesses that resolve&#xD;
      quickly, but which can cause other diseases to take hold or get worse. Routine vaccination&#xD;
      can prevent infection and has been and recommended for use in the United States beginning in&#xD;
      the 1960s and 1970s; and in 1995 for varicella. Today measles, mumps, and rubella are&#xD;
      especially uncommon in the U.S. thanks to vaccination programs; and the percentage of people&#xD;
      with varicella is going down. Despite widespread vaccination efforts, there have been recent&#xD;
      outbreaks of measles and mumps in the U.S., in part because these diseases are still common&#xD;
      in other parts of the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal&#xD;
      tract which includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Treatment options for&#xD;
      IBD consist of immunosuppressive therapy, meaning that the drugs weaken the immune system,&#xD;
      such as systemic corticosteroids, immunomodulators (thiopurines and methotrexate) and/or&#xD;
      biologics, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) agents or an integrin inhibitor&#xD;
      (vedolizumab). Patients with IBD can achieve clinical remission and decrease the risk of&#xD;
      complications with treatment; however, treatment can also increase the risk for infections&#xD;
      because they weaken the immune system. Some of these infections are preventable with routine&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You are invited to take part in this research project to determine if people with IBD on&#xD;
      different types of therapy have a lower amount of antibodies than healthy individuals.&#xD;
      Antibodies are proteins used by the immune system to attack viruses like tetanus and measles.&#xD;
      Antibodies can be introduced into the body through vaccines. The fewer antibodies there are,&#xD;
      the harder it is for the antibodies to attack a virus, meaning that the person could get sick&#xD;
      with a virus. This research project will help us figure out whether people with IBD have&#xD;
      fewer antibodies than people without IBD. The investigators will also look at whether the&#xD;
      type of treatment people take for IBD affects the amount of antibodies. T&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will tell us who is more likely to get sick from viruses, and why. The investigators&#xD;
      will recruit 90 IBD patients under treatment for their IBD as well as 20 healthy controls for&#xD;
      a total of 110 patients at the University of Wisconsin Hospital &amp; Clinics.&#xD;
