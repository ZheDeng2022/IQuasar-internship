      PI3K signaling is a hallmark of many cancers. Subsets of cancers become dependent on PI3K&#xD;
      pathway signaling as a result of mutations of the PIK3CA gene itself or of regulators of PI3K&#xD;
      (e.g. PTEN, HER2). As a consequence, pathway mutated tumors are particularly sensitive&#xD;
      towards PI3K-pathway inhibition. BKM120 is a potent and highly specific oral pan-class I&#xD;
      PI3K-inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study FM-11-F01b is a phase Ib single institution study using the combination of BKM120&#xD;
      and cisplatin or carboplatin in patient with pathologically confirmed recurrent or metastatic&#xD;
      advanced solid tumor, for which treatment with a platinum agent is indicated (preferentially&#xD;
      head and neck, NSCLC, ovary, endometrial).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to define the phase II recommended dose of daily oral&#xD;
      BKM120 and cisplatin (Group 1) or carboplatin (Group 2), given intravenously (IV) on day 1&#xD;
      every 3 weeks.&#xD;

      Despite recent progresses in antineoplastic therapy durable cancer remission is still&#xD;
      infrequent in many solid tumors and new treatment options are needed for patients whose&#xD;
      cancer has progressed following standard therapies. There is an increasing interest of&#xD;
      evaluating new combinations of cytotoxics with new molecule targeted agents which could&#xD;
      increase antitumor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PI3K signaling is a hallmark of many cancers. Subsets of cancers become dependent on PI3K&#xD;

      itor. The study treatment foreseen BKM120 administered on a continuous once daily dosing&#xD;
      schedule at a dose of 60, 80 or 100 mg (p.o.) plus Carboplatin or Cisplatin. Cisplatin 75&#xD;
      mg/mq will be administered as a 2 hours intravenous infusion every 3 weeks. Carboplatin AUC 5&#xD;
      (or AUC 6 if dose level 3 has been completed) will be administered as a 30 minutes&#xD;
      intravenous infusion diluted in 250 mL of normal saline every 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single institution phase I study. Up to 3 dose levels of daily BMK120 will be&#xD;
      studied. A standard 3 + 3 phase I dose escalation design will be used for both Group 1 and&#xD;
      Group 2. Dose escalation in Group 1 and Group 2 will be mutually independent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to define the phase II recommended dose of daily oral&#xD;
      BKM120 and cisplatin (Group 1) or carboplatin (Group 2), given intravenously (IV) on day 1&#xD;
