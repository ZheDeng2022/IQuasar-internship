  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this proposed study is to compare use of a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative)&#xD;
      controller versus an MPC (Model Predictive Control) controller algorithm in an artificial&#xD;
      pancreas system, all other components and study design being equal. The study design, power&#xD;
      calculation and endpoints were developed based on the results of an initial feasibility study&#xD;
      (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01987206) that has already been completed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized crossover study consists of an evaluation of either type of control algorithm&#xD;
      (MPC or PID) as a part of the Artificial Pancreas (AP) device during two periods of 27.5-hour&#xD;
      closed-loop control in a minimally supervised setting (outpatient research area at the&#xD;
      William Sansum Diabetes Center, Santa Barbara, CA) separated by a minimum of 5 days and a&#xD;
      maximum of 2 weeks. The 27.5-hour period includes: 2 announced meals (dinner and breakfast of&#xD;
      65g and 50g CHO respectively) preceded with a dose of rapid-acting insulin equivalent to 100%&#xD;
      bolus based on each subject's Insulin to Carbohydrate (I:C) ratio and 1 unannounced meal&#xD;
      (lunch of 65g carbohydrates, same meal content as dinner); complete night from 12:00 am to&#xD;
      7:00 am. The goal is to demonstrate that the AP device is able to maintain the subject blood&#xD;
      glucose within a safe range at all times.&#xD;

    <description>The percentage of time spent in safe blood glucose range of 70-180 mg/dl, comparing MPC, PID and the 24-hour period of Open-Loop Care just prior to each study session. More time spent inside the desired range will be considered successful.</description>

    <description>The secondary endpoint measures glucose extremes (the time spent in the hypoglycemic range &lt;70 mg/dl, time spent in the hyperglycemic range &gt;180 mg/dl) and the need for outside intervention to prevent hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia comparing MPC, PID and the 24-hour period of Open-Loop Care just prior to each study session. Interventions would be insulin injections or oral carbohydrates given to the subject by the physician, as well as alerts from the health monitoring system. No need for physician intervention will be considered a successful outcome.</description>
