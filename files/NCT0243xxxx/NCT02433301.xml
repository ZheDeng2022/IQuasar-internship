  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of malignity in the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) is rising in Denmark, 400&#xD;
      new cases annually 1. 60% of the patients with GEJ cancer have disseminated disease&#xD;
      (M1-stage) at time of diagnosis and are consequently unable to undergo curative intended&#xD;
      surgery. The prognosis is poor, with 5-year survival rates of approximately 2 % for these 60%&#xD;
      and the treatment only consists of palliative therapy 1. For the remaining approximately 40 %&#xD;
      who are assessed as candidates for curative intended surgery, the 5-year survival rate is 33&#xD;
      % 1. This emphasizes the need for further research and knowledge concerning tumour biology&#xD;
      and spontaneous course of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Denmark, all cancer patients are enrolled in a specific cancer program. The primary&#xD;
      diagnostic work-up for GEJ cancers includes gastroscopy with biopsy, blood samples,&#xD;
      ultrasonography scan, Positronemissionstomography (PET) and Computed tomography (CT) alone or&#xD;
      PET/CT in combination 2. From these parameters physicians determine resectability and&#xD;
      TNM-stage (tumour staging), which is substantial for the prognosis and future treatment. The&#xD;
      primary goal is to achieve a macroscopically resection of tumour and lymphnodes in relation&#xD;
      to the stomach and oesophagus (Esophagectomi a.m. Ivor Lewis and D1+ lymphadenectomy in the&#xD;
      abdomen and thorax). In addition to surgery, patients receive perioperative chemotherapy,&#xD;
      which consist of three series of chemotherapy preoperative and three series postoperative&#xD;
      approximately 21-28 days after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 12.6 % of patients receiving perioperative chemotherapy prior to surgery will&#xD;
      have disease progression due to chemotherapy resistance during the therapy 3. This&#xD;
      unintentionally leads to shifting these patients from the resectable group to non-resectable&#xD;
      group (palliative treatment). Thus, the possibility for detecting response to perioperative&#xD;
      chemotherapy is of great interest. A paradigm shift towards an individualised tailored&#xD;
      therapy form has emerged in recent years, which potentially require a higher need for&#xD;
      diagnosis on molecular level. Today most molecular biological methods apply tissue samples&#xD;
      for in-vitro analyses, but new radiological tools provide opportunity for non-invasive&#xD;
      examinations; for example PET can with a radioactive sugar compound: Flour-18 deoxyglucose&#xD;
      (18F-FDG). This compound is injected through a catheter in a larger vein (media cubiti vein)&#xD;
      and absorbed in cells with increased metabolism - especially cancer cells. A PET scanner&#xD;
      registers the absorption; this radiology modality can provide valid information, which is&#xD;
      essential for non-invasive tumour staging and monitoring response under a specific therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new diagnostic modality is PET scan combinated with magnetic resonance (PET/MR)&#xD;
      simultaneously. So far, no studies have conducted an evaluation of simultaneous PET/MR scan&#xD;
      to assess the perioperative chemotherapy response in patients with GEJ cancer. However, some&#xD;
      studies suggest that commercially available PET/MR scanner might contribute in a diagnostic&#xD;
      elucidation 6. Simultaneous PET/MR scan might in theory minimize the misinterpretations of&#xD;
      potential response changes after chemotherapy, which can appear in the interval between&#xD;
      separate PET, CT and MR scans 4,5,7. Studies have found PET scan of GEJ cancer could be&#xD;
      helpful as a prognostic tool to differentiate between responders and non-responders during&#xD;
      chemotherapy 9. Standardized uptake value (SUV) is a unit that display the absorption of&#xD;
      18F-FDG and is used routinely to quantify tumour glucose metabolism in PET scan 8. A change&#xD;
      of more than 35 % in SUV measurements before and after the induction of chemotherapy is&#xD;
      considered as the definition of responders and non-responders in earlier studies 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MR technique is based on magnetic fields and radio waves. Diffusion Weighted Imaging&#xD;
      (DWI) is a non-invasive MR-modality, which measures the changes in water diffusion (Brownian&#xD;
      movements) throughout tissue. These changes are measured in Apparent Diffusion Coefficient&#xD;
      (ADC), a parameter derived from DWI and reflects the change in diffusion 7. ADC and DWI can&#xD;
      be used to differentiate between benign and malignant tumours, due to a larger cell density&#xD;
      in malignant tumours. Consequently, malignant tissue has a decreased diffusion relative to&#xD;
      normal tissue. ADC has been used as a factor in some studies to predict the response to&#xD;
      chemotherapy 10. A single study has shown a rise in ADC-value two weeks after initiation of&#xD;
      chemotherapy in patients with GEJ cancer, and demonstrated that the percentage change in&#xD;
      ADC-value between the groups (responders and non-responders) is significantly different 11.&#xD;
      Simultaneous PET- and MR scan might be very useful to evaluate the response to chemotherapy&#xD;
      in patients with GEJ cancer compared with these parameters alone. The opportunity for a more&#xD;
      individualised tailored treatment in future might be possible with PET/MR.&#xD;
