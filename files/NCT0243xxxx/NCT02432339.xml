      The purpose of this study is to determine if stopping the stress induced increase in&#xD;
      inflammation will prevent sodium retention which in turn increases blood pressure. Each&#xD;
      subject will test two separate times. One week, they will be taking a daily dose of&#xD;
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), the other week they will be taking a placebo.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will involve a screening visit and two testing weeks over an approximate 3 week&#xD;
      period (this includes a one week &quot;washout&quot; period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each testing week will have a 3 day salt-controlled diet prior to testing and an approximate&#xD;
      3-hour testing period on Day 4. The 3-hour testing period will include 10 minutes of a&#xD;
      baseline rest, 45 minutes of mild stress (competitive video game), and 45 minutes of a&#xD;
      recovery rest. A total of 4 blood and 4 urine samples will be collected during the 3-hour&#xD;
      period. Each blood draw will consist of about 7 teaspoons for a total of 28 teaspoons per&#xD;
      testing week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the screening and testing, I will be asked to take the MoCA (the Montreal Cognitive&#xD;
      Assessment) test in order to measure cognitive thinking after stress. It is a brief&#xD;
      30-question test which takes around 10 minutes to complete. It measures different types of&#xD;
      cognitive abilities, including orientation (the approximate position of something/someone),&#xD;
      short-term memory (remember information for a short period of time), executive function&#xD;
      (planning and problem solving), language abilities (assign appropriate names to appropriate&#xD;
      items), and visuospatial ability (determine distance from one object to another). Each&#xD;
      question is awarded a particular number of points depending on the accuracy of the answers&#xD;
      given. We will be looking to see if the total number of points earned changes in response&#xD;
      before and after stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit: I will come to the GPI or the CRU for a screening visit that will last about&#xD;
      90 minutes. The study will be described in detail and an informed consent will be obtained.&#xD;
      Vital signs will be taken (blood pressure, height, weight and BMI - Body Mass Index. A health&#xD;
      history and a limited physical exam will be conducted by Dr. White (or a physician delegate)&#xD;
      to insure that it is safe for me to participate in the study. A blood sample will be obtained&#xD;
      from me to make sure nothing is wrong with my kidneys or liver or have any other chronic&#xD;
      illness. If all lab work returns with no abnormalities, then I will be cleared to participate&#xD;
      in one of the crossover studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I will also select my food and drink items from a food menu for the 3-day diet prior to&#xD;
      testing. The items I select will give me enough to eat and drink for the 3 days. All food and&#xD;
      drink items will be packed in coolers that I will be responsible for picking up and dropping&#xD;
      off daily. I am not to eat any food or drink item(s) other than those provided, except for&#xD;
      water. To make sure that I am following the diet, I will be asked to return all of my food&#xD;
      wrappers and drink containers to the GPI or CRU. I will also be asked to collect an overnight&#xD;
      urine sample each night so that they can see how much salt I am taking in each day. My&#xD;
      testing weeks will also be scheduled at this visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The last thing that I will be asked to do for the screening visit, is to take the MoCA test&#xD;
      which will take approximately 10 minutes. Someone from the research team will instruct me as&#xD;
      to what to do for each question and I will answer each one to the best of my ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing Week One: The week prior to my scheduled testing week, I will pick up my food coolers&#xD;
      for the 3 day study diet along with my 7 Â½ day prescription of either the MMF or the placebo.&#xD;
      In addition, if I am female, I will have to give a urine sample so that a pregnancy test can&#xD;
      be performed to make sure I am not pregnant before I start taking the medication. Should the&#xD;
      pregnancy test show positive, I will not be allowed to continue participating in the study. I&#xD;
      will take the study medication (either MMF or a placebo) 500 mgs twice a day for the 71/2&#xD;
      days as instructed, taking my last dose the morning of testing at GPI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The coolers will contain the food and drink items that I selected previously at my screening&#xD;
      visit. I will also receive the overnight urine collection bottles. During the diet phase of&#xD;
      testing, I will collect a urine sample before I go to bed each night and record the time&#xD;
      (write the time on the bottle). I will also collect a urine sample as soon as I wake up each&#xD;
      morning and record the time. I will be returning the urine collection bottles and food&#xD;
      coolers to GPI or CRU starting on the second day of the diet phase. This means that I will&#xD;
      return my Monday cooler and urine collection bottle on Tuesday (Day 2). I will then return my&#xD;
      Tuesday cooler and collection bottle on Wednesday (Day 3). On Thursday (testing day), I will&#xD;
      bring back my Wednesday cooler and urine collection bottle. During the diet phase of the&#xD;
      study, if I am female, a pregnancy test will be performed on each overnight urine sample to&#xD;
      ensure that I am not pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On testing day, I will bring with me my Wednesday cooler and overnight urine sample and will&#xD;
      be given breakfast before testing begins. Again, if I am female, a pregnancy test will be&#xD;
      performed on my last (Wednesday) overnight urine sample to ensure I am not pregnant. I will&#xD;
      be taken to a private room for testing and placed into a comfortable reclining chair. A&#xD;
      nurse/phlebotomist will insert a small needle attached to a plastic tube called a catheter&#xD;
      into a vein in my hand or arm. This procedure will allow the nurse/phlebotomist to collect&#xD;
      the 4 blood samples over the 3-hour testing period. The needle stick may cause some temporary&#xD;
      pain and may result in a black and blue mark. A device that automatically takes blood&#xD;
      pressure will then be put on the opposite arm. I will also be given water in order to take my&#xD;
      last dose of medication before testing begins and to sip on during the duration of testing.&#xD;
      During the first 10 minute baseline rest period, I will relax in a reclining chair. I can&#xD;
      listen to music, read a book or magazine or watch movies to pass the time. My blood pressure&#xD;
      will be taken before and after this 10 minute rest period. Once the baseline rest period is&#xD;
      over, a blood and urine sample will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the stress period, I will play a video game against another subject for 45 minutes. My&#xD;
      blood pressure will continue to be measured every 10 minutes. I will also continue to sip on&#xD;
      water during this time. At the end of the game, another blood and urine sample will be&#xD;
      collected. I will then be asked to complete the MoCA test a second time. It will be the same&#xD;
      questions I was asked during the screening visit. A research team member will instruct me&#xD;
      again as to how to answer each question and I will answer them to the best of my ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The last 45 minute recovery period of relaxation will be the same as the first (reading,&#xD;
      listening to music or watching movies). My blood pressure will continue to be taken every 10&#xD;
      minutes. Once the 45 minutes has ended the last blood and urine sample will be collected and&#xD;
      the testing day will then be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing Week Two: The procedures for the Testing Week 2 are the same as Week 1. I will be on&#xD;
      the controlled salt diet for 3-days, will take the study medication twice a day and will do&#xD;
      the 3-hour testing on the 4th day. Like the first week, there will be 10 minute baseline rest&#xD;
      period, 45 minutes stress period of the competitive video game and 45 minutes recovery rest&#xD;
      period. Blood and urine samples will also be collected and I will be asked to take the MoCA&#xD;
      test just like during Week 1 testing. Approximately 56 teaspoons of blood will be collected&#xD;
      during the entire study. This blood will be used to examine how biochemical factors (stress&#xD;
      hormones) relate to blood pressure and cardiovascular (heart) health. The DNA (genetic&#xD;
      material) from the blood will be studied for genes relating to high blood pressure and other&#xD;
      genes that may be related to the risk of cardiovascular disease. The blood, urine and DNA&#xD;
      samples may be stored and used for other similar studies by Dr. Harshfield, Dr. Harris and&#xD;
      Dr. Dong. The genetic results from these studies will not be told to myself and will not be&#xD;
      given to any doctor or other individual.&#xD;
