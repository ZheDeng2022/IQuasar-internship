  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first purpose of this study is to test a new computer program that reduces the blurring&#xD;
      in the cone-beam CT scan and helps the doctor to better locate the tumor. The investigators&#xD;
      want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, that this has on the patient and the way we&#xD;
      treat the cancer in the lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second purpose of this study is to test how well this computer program tracks markers in&#xD;
      the images, compared to using radio signals to follow the markers.&#xD;

    <description>Physician evaluation of patient setup accuracy will be performed using all available images and adjustments will be made as per standard practice. In addition, a respiration motion-corrected CBCT (daily for SBRT, weekly for standard fractionation) will be used to confirm the accuracy of Calypso-based setup. Patients will return for follow up at 3,6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 months (+/- 4 weeks) following completion of radiation therapy. The following assessments will be performed at these visits: history and physical exam, diagnostic CT chest, and toxicity assessment.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologic proof of malignancy suitable for thoracic radiation therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is planning to undergo radiation therapy for primary or recurrent malignancies&#xD;
             of the lung or metastatic malignancies to the lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky Performance Status ≥ 60%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least part of the tumor must be visible as observed in a diagnostic or planning CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to have bronchoscopic placement of Calypso transponders as confirmed on a recent&#xD;
             (within the past 8 weeks) CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with clinically significant active infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bronchiectasis in the region of the intended implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hypersensitivity to nickel.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other medical condition or laboratory value that would, at the discretion of the&#xD;
             investigator, preclude the patient from participation in this clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Deemed unable to safely undergo or tolerate flexible bronchoscopy as per institutional&#xD;
             guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to tolerate anesthesia or sedation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Enrolled in any other clinical studies the investigator believes to be in conflict&#xD;
             with this investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients who are pregnant or nursing&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria for Calypso transponders:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Implants in the chest region that contain metal or conductive materials (e.g., metal&#xD;
             implants, rods, or plates) which Calypso Medical considers will interfere with the&#xD;
             Calypso System's electromagnetic localization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active implanted devices, such as pacemakers, defibrillators, and drug infusion pumps&#xD;
             since the effects of the Calypso System operation on these devices are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients whose lung tumors are being monitored by MR imaging as part of standard&#xD;
             clinical care. Implantation of transponders will degrade MR images.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Posterior lesions that would be &gt;19 cm distance from Calypso detector plate.&#xD;
