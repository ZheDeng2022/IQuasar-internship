  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to examine the cognitive, immunological, and&#xD;
      neurophysiological effects of transitioning from tobacco cigarettes to electronic cigarettes.&#xD;
      The central hypothesis of this study is that this transition will be accompanied by a&#xD;
      decrease in peripheral inflammation, which will lead to significant changes in the&#xD;
      neurocircuitry underlying interoception and appetite.&#xD;

      Participants who are current cigarette smokers will be randomly assigned to either the&#xD;
      experimental or control groups. Following a baseline psychiatric assessment session, subjects&#xD;
      will return to the study center for two to three additional follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the second visit, all subjects will undergo a functional magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (fMRI) scanning session, during which they will perform a series of functional neuroimaging&#xD;
      tasks designed to examine the neural substrates involved in visceral interoception and eating&#xD;
      behavior. Prior to the start of the scan session, blood samples will be collected from each&#xD;
      subject, for the measurement of bio-markers related to nicotine use and peripheral&#xD;
      inflammation. After the end of the second visit, subjects within the experimental group will&#xD;
      be asked to switch from combustible to electronic cigarettes. Subjects within the control&#xD;
      group will continue to smoke combustible cigarettes as previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the third visit, which will follow two to eight weeks after the second visit, all&#xD;
      subjects will provide a second blood sample and complete a second fMRI scan session. Both&#xD;
      groups of participants will complete the same fMRI tasks as they did during the second visit.&#xD;
