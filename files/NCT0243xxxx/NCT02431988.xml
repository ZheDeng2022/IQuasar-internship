  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to administer novel cluster of differentiation antigen 19 (CD19)&#xD;
      specific Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cells (CAR19 T-cells) to patients with relapsed or&#xD;
      resistant Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) to assess the safety and efficacy of this&#xD;
      strategy as a bridge to allogeneic transplantation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) resistant to or relapsing following&#xD;
      rituximab-containing chemotherapy regimens have a poor prognosis. Patients may receive&#xD;
      salvage chemotherapy and possibly an autologous stem cell transplant (auto-SCT). A proportion&#xD;
      of these patients, however, will not respond to the chemotherapy or may relapse after the&#xD;
      auto-SCT and therefore require novel treatment options. Such patients may benefit from an&#xD;
      allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-STC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators aim to administer CAR19 T-cells to act as a bridge to the&#xD;
      transplant strategy. Specifically, (1) the feasibility of generating CD19 specific Chimeric&#xD;
      Antigen Receptor T-cells called CAR19 T-cells, (2) the safety of administering the CD19 CAR&#xD;
      T-cells in this setting, (3) how well the CAR19 T-cells engraft and (4) to evaluate how&#xD;
      effective these cells are as a bridge to allogeneic transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following informed consent and registration to the trial, patients will undergo an&#xD;
      unstimulated leucapheresis for generation of the CAR19 T cells. Whilst the cells are being&#xD;
      generated, patients will proceed with a further cycle of standard salvage (recommended&#xD;
      ifosfamide, epirubicin and etoposide (i.e. the IVE regime), and should not receive rituximab.&#xD;
      Patients will receive pre-conditioning with intravenous fludarabine and cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      prior to infusion of a single dose of CAR-modified T-cells. An escalating dose protocol will&#xD;
      be employed to identify a minimum effective dose of CAR19 T-cells.&#xD;
