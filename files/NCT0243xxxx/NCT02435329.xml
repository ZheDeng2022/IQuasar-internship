    <textblock>
      This study is part of a research project for a University MD Program. This is an&#xD;
      observational study aimed at comparing the differences in bone metabolism and&#xD;
      microcirculation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (with and without diabetic&#xD;
      neuropathy and Charcot foot) with healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes is gradually becoming a global epidemic along with its associated complications.&#xD;
      Diabetes can affect several systems in our body particularly the eyes, nerves and the&#xD;
      kidneys. The damaging effects occur at the level of the small blood vessels&#xD;
      (microcirculation) that supply these vital structures. Normally, the inner lining of these&#xD;
      blood vessels (endothelium) plays a very important role in maintaining adequate blood flow.&#xD;
      The endothelium releases a chemical substance called nitric oxide, which relaxes these small&#xD;
      blood vessels thereby ensuring sufficient blood supply to these key structures. Nitric oxide&#xD;
      also prevents blockage of these vessels. Any form of metabolic stress like hyperglycaemia&#xD;
      (raised blood sugar as seen in diabetes) can cause abnormal changes in the normal behaviour&#xD;
      of the endothelium (endothelial dysfunction). Therefore hyperglycaemia promotes endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction by lowering nitric oxide levels, which may lead to diabetic complications like&#xD;
      diabetic retinopathy (eye damage), nephropathy (kidney damage) or neuropathy (nerve damage).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, patients with diabetes also suffer from osteoporosis (thinning of bones).&#xD;
      Osteoporosis is a bone disorder characterised by a reduction in bone mineral content leading&#xD;
      to an increased risk of developing fractures. The increased risk of fractures in patients&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes is attributed to poor bone quality resulting from the harmful effects of&#xD;
      high blood glucose. Studies have also shown that nitric oxide has a bone protective effect as&#xD;
      demonstrated by its ability to prevent bone fragmentation and improve bone strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study of markers of endothelial function and bone metabolism will facilitate a better&#xD;
      understanding about the origin of diabetic complications. This will aid in the development of&#xD;
      novel therapeutic agents that target the harmful triggers in diabetes and eventually may&#xD;
      prevent and retard the onset of the debilitating diabetic complications.&#xD;

           technique of skin autofluorescence&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of the microcirculation with Laser Doppler Iontophoresis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standard measurement of microcirculation is laser Doppler iontophoresis, which is used by&#xD;
      several research institutes. In this trial the skin microcirculation will be measured on the&#xD;
      dorsum of the foot using a Perimed Laser Doppler imager and iontophoresis system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endothelial-mediated vasodilation will be measured by the iontophoresis of acetylcholine,&#xD;
      while sodium nitroprusside will be used to measure endothelium-independent vasodilation. The&#xD;
      iontophoresis system consists of an ION chamber (iontophoresis delivery vehicle device) that&#xD;
      sticks firmly to the skin and a reference electrode. The response in blood flow will be&#xD;
      imaged and quantified using the Perimed Laser Doppler Imager (PeriScan PIMII; Perimed,&#xD;
      Sweden).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of AGE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An AGE reader, which utilizes the principle of skin autofluorescence, will measure the&#xD;
      accumulation of AGE in the skin. This validated device provides a real-time, non-invasive&#xD;
      assessment of cardiovascular risk for chronic diseases like Diabetes, renal failure,&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, etc. AGE-modified proteins have autofluorescent properties and when&#xD;
      excited by ultraviolet (UV) light they emit fluorescence in particular wavelengths. The&#xD;
      levels of AGE in skin correlate with AGE levels in blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volar aspect of the forearm will be placed on the AGE reader, which is equipped with a UV&#xD;
      light source. The UV light triggers AGE in skin, after penetrating 1mm of the dermis, to emit&#xD;
      autofluorescence that is then detected by the AGE reader. The intensity of fluorescence&#xD;
      correlates with the quantity of AGE in the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of calcaneal BMD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a simple and convenient method to assess peripheral BMD and assess fracture risk. The&#xD;
      device used is a quantitative ultrasound called Sahara Clinical Bone Sonometer (Sahara&#xD;
      Clinical Bone Sonometer; Hologic, Waltham, MA). The calcaneus is the preferred peripheral&#xD;
      site to assess fracture risk. This device uses ultrasound waves to determine the BMD of the&#xD;
      calcaneus. In this procedure, once the bare heel is placed in the device, the BMD is&#xD;
      calculated within 30 seconds and the results are then generated on paper by the device.&#xD;
