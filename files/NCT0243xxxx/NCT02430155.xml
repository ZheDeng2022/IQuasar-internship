  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is responsible for around 25% of maternal mortality worldwide&#xD;
      reaching as high as 60% in some countries.PPH can also be a cause of long-term severe&#xD;
      morbidity, and approximately 12% of women who survive PPH will have severe anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postpartum hemorrhage has been defined as blood loss in excess of 500 ml in a vaginal birth&#xD;
      and in excess of 1 L in a cesarean delivery.For clinical purposes, any blood loss that has&#xD;
      the potential to produce hemodynamic instability should be considered a PPH. However,&#xD;
      clinical estimates of blood loss are often inaccurate. Primary (immediate) PPH occurs within&#xD;
      the first 24 hours after delivery and approximately 70% of these cases are due to uterine&#xD;
      atony. Furthermore, uterine tony is defined as the failure of the uterus to contract&#xD;
      adequately after the child is born.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guidelines for the management of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) involve a stepwise approach&#xD;
      including the exclusion of retained products of conception and genital tract trauma. Uterine&#xD;
      atony, which is the most common cause, the management of uterine atony is an established&#xD;
      stepwise protocol that in many international guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uterine massage is recommended for the treatment of PPH. Initiate uterine massages soon as&#xD;
      excessive bleeding/uterine atony is identified. Intravenous oxytocin alone still is the&#xD;
      recommended uterotonic drug for the treatment of PPH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If intravenous oxytocin is unavailable or if the bleeding does not respond to oxytocin,&#xD;
      intravenous ergometrine, oxytocin-ergometrine fixed dose or a prostaglandin drug (including&#xD;
      sublingual misoprostol, 600 mcg) should be given. The use of intrauterine balloon tamponade&#xD;
      is recommended for the treatment of primary PPH due to uterine atony in women who do not&#xD;
      respond to uterotonics or if uterotonics are not available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 1983, when Goldrath published evidence that inserting a Foley catheter in the uterus&#xD;
      and inflating it with water could achieve tamponade, case series and other studies have&#xD;
      suggested that various uterine balloon tamponade(UBT) devices may be effective in treating&#xD;
      PPH. The studies used various types of UBT devices, including a condom catheter, a Foley&#xD;
      catheter, the Sengstaken-Blakemore Esophageal Tube, the Rusch Balloon, and the Bakri Uterine&#xD;
      Balloon. In 2007, a systematic review of treatment options for PPH found that 84% success&#xD;
      rate of UBT does not significantly vary from surgical treatment outcomes.The World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO), the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO), the&#xD;
      American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists(ACOG), the Royal College of Obstetricians&#xD;
      and Gynecologists(RCOG), and the International Confederation of Midwives (ICM) recognize&#xD;
      balloon tamponade as a method that could significantly improve the management intractable&#xD;
      PPH, especially in low-resource areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2012, WHO updated the guidelines for the management of PPH and retained placenta to&#xD;
      include: &quot;The use of intrauterine balloon tamponade is recommended for the treatment of PPH&#xD;
      due to uterine atony. This recommendation is now stronger than the previous guidelines. It&#xD;
      can be used for women who do not respond to uterotonics or if uterotonics are not available.&#xD;
      This procedure potentially can avoid surgery and is appropriate while awaiting transfer to a&#xD;
      higher-level facility&quot;.Furthermore, FIGO included UBT as a recommended second-line&#xD;
      intervention for the treatment of PPH in their updated guidelines issued in 2012.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bakri first published the concept of intrauterine balloon technology in the management of&#xD;
      hemorrhage secondary to placenta praevia-accreta during caesarean section with or without&#xD;
      bilateral hypo gastric arterial ligation.In 2006, the ACOG Practice Bulletin, published by&#xD;
      the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, made mention of the Bakri postpartum&#xD;
      balloon for its specifically tailored design that enables conservative management of uterine&#xD;
      bleeding in cases of uterine atony and other causes of PPH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The idea of using a condom as a balloon tamponade was first generated and evaluated in&#xD;
      Bangladesh by Sayeba Akhter to fill a need and in response to the high cost of commercially&#xD;
      available UBT devices.&#xD;
