  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection can result in a greater risk of adverse outcomes in&#xD;
      HIV-infected individuals, including more rapid progression to cirrhosis and associated&#xD;
      complications such as hepatocellular carcinoma. For this reason, as well as the shared routes&#xD;
      of transmission between the two viruses, UK and International guidance recommends that all&#xD;
      HBV-negative HIV-infected individuals be offered vaccination against HBV. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      response rates in this population can be as low as 17.5 - 40% to standard vaccination&#xD;
      courses. To improve this response, strategies such as the use of double dose of standard&#xD;
      vaccines (e.g. Engerix B) is recommended in several guidelines for previous non-responders,&#xD;
      although there is currently limited evidence for this approach. An alternative strategy is to&#xD;
      use vaccines with novel adjuvants such as Fendrix and observational clinical data in the&#xD;
      Investigators HIV cohort suggests that response rates can be as high as 81% of individuals&#xD;
      achieving HBV surface antibody (HBsAb) levels &gt;100 in a group that did not respond to&#xD;
      previous standard HBV vaccine courses. However, the cost of Fendrix is considerably higher&#xD;
      than Engerix B and controlled trials are required to confirm whether this approach is&#xD;
      warranted. Furthermore, insights into the potential mechanisms by which Fendrix may elicit&#xD;
      better responses would be valuable in optimising future vaccine strategies in this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators propose to conduct a randomised, open label, active-controlled pilot study&#xD;
      comparing double dose Engerix B and Fendrix in HIV-infected non-responders to standard HBV&#xD;
      vaccine courses, which will provide the necessary data to design and power a larger&#xD;
      multicentre randomised controlled trial. Outcome measures will include the proportion of&#xD;
      individuals seroconverting with HBsAb levels &gt;100 following each vaccination course, the&#xD;
      magnitude and quality of the HBV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses elicited by each vaccine and&#xD;
      the durability of the HBsAb response at 1 year following the end of vaccination.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      To compare the immunological responses in HIV-infected non-responders to standard hepatitis B&#xD;
      vaccination courses to immunization with either double-dose Engerix B or Fendrix:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Investigators will measure the proportion of individuals seroconverting with Hepatitis B&#xD;
           surface antibody titres of &gt;100 (and ≥10) IU/ml at 8 weeks after the immunisation&#xD;
           course, as well as the durability of this response at 1 year following the completion of&#xD;
           the course. The primary aim will be to provide some preliminary data from a head to head&#xD;
           study of these two approaches with which to power a larger multi-centre randomized&#xD;
           controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigators will define the magnitude and quality of the Hepatitis B-specific CD4+&#xD;
           T-cell response following vaccination, thus obtaining key immunological data to fill the&#xD;
           knowledge gap in T-cell responses to Hepatitis B vaccination, required to support the&#xD;
           rationale design of future multi-centre, randomized study comparing vaccination&#xD;
           strategies in HIV-infected non-responders to standard Hepatitis B vaccine courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research is original. There is only one published study to date looking at the efficacy&#xD;
      of double-dose Engerix B in HIV-infected non-responders to standard courses1. There is&#xD;
      currently anecdotal experience of the use of Fendrix in this group from the Investigators&#xD;
      cohort and others. There are no head-to-head comparisons of these two strategies.&#xD;
