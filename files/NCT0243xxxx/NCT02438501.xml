      Many trials that patients with advanced or recurrent indolent lymphoma managed with very&#xD;
      low-dose (4Gy) limited-field RT (LD-IFRT) have shown that high response rates and durable&#xD;
      remission can be achieved. However, the results of two phase III trials have failed to&#xD;
      demonstrate the lasting response rate (RR) with LD-IFRT versus in other approaches.&#xD;
      Histology, bulky tumor (&gt;5 cm), higher number of prior chemotherapy regimens, adoption of&#xD;
      rituximab, and age&gt;65 years have been shown to significantly influence response rates of&#xD;
      LD-IFRT. The objectives of this trial investigate the efficacy of palliative low-dose&#xD;
      involved-field radiation therapy in patients lower than 65 years of age with recurrent&#xD;
      advanced follicular lymphoma.&#xD;

      Introduction: Follicular lymphoma（FL) often involves lymph nodes and the bone marrow and is&#xD;
      widely regarded as a systemic and advanced-stage disease when it is diagnosed in more than&#xD;
      two-thirds of patients at initial presentation. Follicular lymphoma Grade 1 or 2 with&#xD;
      indolent histologic characteristics is presently not considered curable in the majority of&#xD;
      patients though it is very sensitive to both chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The policy&#xD;
      treated for patients with stage III and IV FL, which recommended by NCCN, is suggested&#xD;
      regimens, clinical trial or local RT (palliation) based on the previous results that similar&#xD;
      efficacy was obtained after management by chlorambucil single-agent therapy,&#xD;
      polychemotherapy, immunochemotherapy, RT or CMT(RT and Chemotherapy). Patients with&#xD;
      advanced-stage disease tend to have frequent relapses and the interval between subsequent&#xD;
      relapses tends to shorten over time. However, they usually have a relatively long life&#xD;
      expectancy, with a median survival ranging from 6 to 10 years. Try to change the natural&#xD;
      history of FL and have a long term PFS are the goals of treatment for advanced stage FL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the treatment strategy, watch and wait, was managed in Standford in the 1980s, several&#xD;
      prospective randomized trials have failed to demonstrate a survival advantage with immediate&#xD;
      treatment versus a &quot;watch and wait&quot; approach in patients with advanced stage, low tumor&#xD;
      burden FL. Though many systemic therapy options are available for patients with stage III and&#xD;
      IV FL, there is no consensus as to which first-line treatment should be provided to those&#xD;
      patients. &quot;Watch and wait&quot; as a approach is still recommended to the patients even in the&#xD;
      rituximab era. GELA provided the indications for treatment, when the treatment a patient&#xD;
      should be initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of traditional RT with or without chemotherapy in advanced stage FL is not definite.&#xD;
      FL is considered to be one of the most radiosensitive tumors. However, a significant&#xD;
      proportion of patients relapse with systemic disease outside of radiation fields and no&#xD;
      difference in OS were observed in advanced patients between RT alone and CMT. The&#xD;
      complications related to traditional RT, including cardiovascular disease and disorders of&#xD;
      blood cell production, were needed to emphasize for those indolent advanced patients who need&#xD;
      frequent palliative management and can long-term survive with NHL. In order to decrease the&#xD;
      late complications after Large-field RT, reduction of irradiation field and smaller&#xD;
      therapeutic doses of radiation were commonly managed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many trials that patients with advanced or recurrent FL managed with very low-dose (4Gy)&#xD;
      limited-field RT have shown that high response rates and durable remission can be achieved.&#xD;
      The response rates (either a complete or partial response) reported in previous study that&#xD;
      low-dose involved-field RT (LD-IFRT) is given in 2 daily fractions (2×2 Gy) is 81% to 92%.&#xD;
      The median time to first recurrence was 14 to 15 months. The median overall survival for&#xD;
      patients with a positive response was 41 months. The median time to in-field progression was&#xD;
      21months, and the median time to out-field progression was 8 months. The predominant mode of&#xD;
      tumor cell death after low-dose RT may be by apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two phase III trials have been designed to assess the further role of LD-IFRT. However, the&#xD;
      results have failed to demonstrate the lasting response rate (RR) with LD-IFRT versus in&#xD;
      other approaches. The HOVON 47/EORTC 20013 Intergroup study (www.hovon.nl) which compares&#xD;
      LD-IFRT to chlorambucil chemotherapy in previously untreated FL patients, the main end points&#xD;
      including progression-free survival and quality of life are evaluating. However, the trial&#xD;
      was closed in 2005 after 21 cases included because of the clinical adoption of rituximab. The&#xD;
      age of most eligible patients was older than 65 years. Another trial, Follicular Radiotherapy&#xD;
      Trial (CRUK- FORT), launched recently in the United Kingdom is randomizing patients with FL&#xD;
      needing RT to 24 Gy in 12 fractions versus 4 Gy in 2 fractions as either definitive or&#xD;
      palliative treatment for FL. A significantly lower overall response rate (81% vs 74%) and&#xD;
      2-year local progression-free rate (94% vs 80%) were found in the 4Gy group. Over half of the&#xD;
      patients in the clinic trial were on stage I and stage II. Moreover, the histologies included&#xD;
      many other pathologic subtypes of indolent lymphoma besides follicular Grade 1 or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of prognostic factors for treatment efficacy is not consensus. Histology has been&#xD;
      shown to significantly influence response rates. Compared to other subtypes of indolent&#xD;
      lymphoma, the higher response rate of low-dose involved-field radiotherapy (LD-IFRT) as&#xD;
      palliative treatment for indolent lymphoma has been explored in follicular lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age at diagnosis, and prior systemic therapy are more estimated. In the retrospective review&#xD;
      by Girinsky et al. 48 patients with indolent lymphoma treated with LD-IF-RT, factors that&#xD;
      were significantly associated with lack of response including bulky tumor (&gt;5 cm), higher&#xD;
      number of prior chemotherapy regimens, and age&gt;65 years. Haas et al. reported their&#xD;
      experience of 109 patients with recurrent indolent B-cell NHL treated with LD-IF-RT. Patients&#xD;
      with only one or two lymphoma sites and disease size of &lt;5 cm were significantly more likely&#xD;
      to achieve a CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management for advanced FL patients with relapse disease after initial management can be&#xD;
      affected by significant toxicity associated with Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy. The role of&#xD;
      low-dose involved-field radiotherapy (LD-IFRT) as palliative treatment for advanced FL has&#xD;
      been explored. LD-IFRT for selected patients including advanced FL, aged lower than 65 years&#xD;
      and disease size of &lt;5 cm may have excellent effection in achieving repeated remissions with&#xD;
      limited associative toxicity and may postpone the need for systemic therapy. The management&#xD;
      is valuable assessed.&#xD;
