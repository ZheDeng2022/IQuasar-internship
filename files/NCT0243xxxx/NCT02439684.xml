      This is a cross-sectional study that aims to assess the sensitivity and specificity of using&#xD;
      HbA1c as a diagnostic test for detecting the presence of diabetes mellitus (DM) when compared&#xD;
      to the use of oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) among Hong Kong Chinese adult who have&#xD;
      impaired fasting glucose (IFG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit around 1000 non-diabetic adult participants who have impaired&#xD;
      fasting glucose (i.e. fasting glucose level between 5.6 to 6.9mmol/L) AND without symptoms of&#xD;
      hyperglycaemia to undergo both HbA1c test and oral glucose tolerance test after obtaining&#xD;
      their informed consent. A diagnosis of DM is confirmed when both the fasting glucose level&#xD;
      and 2-hour-post challenge plasma glucose level fall into diabetic range (i.e. fasting glucose&#xD;
      level ≥7.0mmol/L and 2-hour-post challenge plasma glucose level ≥11.1mmol/L) after a standard&#xD;
      75g OGTT. Participants with only 1 plasma glucose value within the diabetic range will be&#xD;
      invited to repeat an oral glucose tolerance test for confirmation of their diagnosis as&#xD;
      recommended by American Diabetes Association and World Health Organization. Demographic data&#xD;
      of the participants including age, gender, smoking status, medical history, diet and activity&#xD;
      level will be collected. Lipid profile, blood pressure, waist circumference and body mass&#xD;
      index will be checked and the total cardiovascular risk in 10 years will be calculated for&#xD;
      each participant using the Joint British Societies 2005 and Framingham 2008 equations to&#xD;
      evaluate the baseline cardiovascular risk of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data will be analyzed using SPSS. The primary outcomes are the sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of HbA1c in detecting diabetes mellitus diagnosed by oral glucose tolerance test&#xD;
      (the gold standard). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve will be obtained by&#xD;
      plotting sensitivity against (1-specificity) for each cutoff value for identification of an&#xD;
      optimal cutoff point. Diagnostic accuracy will be assessed by the area under the curve (AUC).&#xD;
      The differences in characteristics among participants diagnosed to have diabetes mellitus by&#xD;
      oral glucose tolerance test or HbA1c will be compared using independent t-test or χ2 test for&#xD;
      comparison between the 2 groups.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To calculate the sensitivity and specificity of HbA1c, using different cut-off values&#xD;
           compared to the use of OGTT as the gold standard in the diagnosis of the presence of DM&#xD;
           among Chinese adult patients with IFG&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify the optimal cut-off value of HbA1c for diagnosing DM among the studied&#xD;
           population&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the prevalence of DM among Hong Kong Chinese non-diabetic adult patients with&#xD;
           IFG using OGTT and/or HbA1c criteria as recommended by the 2010 ADA for the diagnosis of&#xD;
           DM&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare the characteristics (i.e. demographics, presence of risk factors for DM and&#xD;
           cardiovascular risk) of Hong Kong Chinese patients who are diagnosed to have DM by OGTT&#xD;
           criterion alone, HbA1c criterion alone, or both criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The prevalence of DM is higher among Chinese adult patients with IFG compared to the&#xD;
           general population of Hong Kong. The figure was estimated to be as much as 25% from&#xD;
           clinical observation. The overall prevalence of DM would be even higher if both OGTT and&#xD;
           HbA1c criteria are used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The use of HbA1c, with the cut-off threshold of ≥ 6.5% recommended by the 2010 ADA&#xD;
           criteria for the diagnosis of DM, will pick up at least 70% of the diabetes cases&#xD;
           identified by OGTT among this high risk group, which is superior to its use among the&#xD;
           Chinese general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The sensitivity of using HbA1c ≥ 6.5% for the diagnosis of DM among this high risk group&#xD;
           is superior to the use of FG ≥ 7.0mmol/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The optimal cut-off threshold of HbA1c in diagnosing DM for this high risk group may not&#xD;
           be 6.5% but lower.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. A subset of patients with impaired glucose regulation (IFG +/- IGT) will be identified&#xD;
           as diabetic according to the HbA1c criterion alone. This group of patient may have a&#xD;
           different cardiovascular risk profile compared to the group of patients who are&#xD;
           diagnosed to have DM according to plasma glucose criteria alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a cross-sectional diagnostic test study to be carried out at various general&#xD;
      out-patient clinics (GOPCs) across Hong Kong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target population and Sampling method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Around 1000 Chinese adult subjects who are classified to have IFG will be recruited from&#xD;
      various GOPCs from the Hong Kong West Cluster and New Territories East Cluster. Convenience&#xD;
      sampling will be employed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation In this diagnostic test study, the sample size calculation was&#xD;
      considered using the disease prevalence and test characteristics represented by the&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity of HbA1c to diagnose DM. The use of HbA1c is assumed to have an&#xD;
      expected sensitivity and specificity of 80%, an approximate estimate according to previous&#xD;
      studies, compared to OGTT for the diagnosis of DM among subjects with IFG and/or IGT. With an&#xD;
      estimated prevalence of DM of 25% in the high risk Chinese population in Hong Kong based on&#xD;
      epidemiological survey in the Chinese population with similar risk profiles, a sample of 204&#xD;
      subjects with DM and 612 subjects without DM will be recruited to obtain the lower limit of&#xD;
      the 95% confidence interval greater than 0.7 with a probability of 0.9530. A sample of 816&#xD;
      will be required. To account for 20% attrition rate, a total sample of 1020 will be required,&#xD;
      with 255 subjects with DM and 765 subjects without DM.&#xD;
