  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a first in man, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      how the drug works in the body in patients with all solid tumours. The aim of this study is&#xD;
      to determine the most effective dose of the study drug that can then be further investigated&#xD;
      in patients with advanced melanoma.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metastatic malignant melanoma is the 5th most common cancer in the UK, with a notable&#xD;
      proportion of young patients. The development of immunotherapies (such as Ipilimumab), and&#xD;
      targeted therapies (such as Vemurafenib, a BRAF inhibitor) have resulted in improved survival&#xD;
      outcomes for patients but is still only measured in months and not years. These targeted&#xD;
      therapies are also only useful for patients with the relevant genetic mutation, leaving a&#xD;
      significant proportion of patients without targeted therapy options. The need for more&#xD;
      effective (and ideally curative) melanoma treatments remains. The Institute of Cancer&#xD;
      Research, with funding from the Wellcome Trust, have created and developed a new panel of&#xD;
      inhibitors that aim to more effectively terminate the growth, spread and survival signals&#xD;
      that sustain the cancer. The broader targets allow patients possessing a range of genetic&#xD;
      mutations to potentially benefit from this targeted therapy. It is hoped that these drugs&#xD;
      could be used as both primary therapy for treatmentnaive patients as well as rescue therapy&#xD;
      for those who have progressed on other targeted therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase 1 study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of one of these new&#xD;
      compounds, CCT 3833, and to define the maximum tolerated dose in patients with advanced&#xD;
      melanoma. The study also aims to examine the way that CCT3833 works within the body. Once the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose has been established a small number of melanoma patients, with&#xD;
      specific mutations and at different treatment option stages, will be treated to gain&#xD;
      additional safety information and an initial indication of the possible efficacy of CCT3833&#xD;
      on melanoma tumours.&#xD;

    <description>CCT3833 is a poorly soluble crystalline compound. It is multi-polymorphic and one form, designated Form D, has been purified and typically has a particle size of about 15-20 μm. Form D readily absorbs and desorbs water, but is not a hydrate and has been selected as the form to take forward into clinical development.</description>

             measures not to father children by using one form of highly effective contraception as&#xD;
             defined above, during the study and for 6 months afterwards. Men with pregnant or&#xD;
             lactating partners should be advised to use barrier method contraception to prevent&#xD;
