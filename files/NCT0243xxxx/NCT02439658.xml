      To assess the ability of common genetic variants in aggregate to predict drug-induced QT&#xD;
      prolongation in patients being loaded with dofetilide or sotalol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center study attempting to identify genetic and other factors that&#xD;
      influence QT interval response to dofetilide or sotalol. One of the goals of this study is to&#xD;
      determine whether genetics might identify individuals at low enough genetic risk for QT&#xD;
      prolongation that outpatient initiation might be feasible. The dofetilide or sotalol use will&#xD;
      be solely determined by clinical staff independent of the research study based on standard&#xD;
      clinical care. The research components of this study include only the additional collection&#xD;
      of blood for genetic analysis, collection of subject data on a CRF and copies of&#xD;
      electrocardiograms performed as part of routine clinical care. This study will be overseen&#xD;
      and coordinated at MGH. Other hospitals that may participate include Mayo Clinic, Cleveland&#xD;
      Clinic, and University of Colorado Hospital; local IRB approval will be sought at each of&#xD;
      these centers. Data will be collected at each individual hospital by co-investigators/site&#xD;
      PIs and stored locally according to IRB requirements. Copies of CRFs, ECGs and blood samples&#xD;
      for genetic analysis will be forwarded to MGH, which will serve as a coordinating and&#xD;
      analysis center (as well as a recruiting center). Data will be encoded where possible;&#xD;
      however, due to the impracticality of removing patient identifiers from certain data types,&#xD;
      such as medication lists and ECGs, some data containing patient information will be&#xD;
      transported and stored at MGH. Dr. Newton-Cheh will serve as overall study PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to conduct a research study to examine known and explore&#xD;
      potentially unknown genetic predictors of QT response in patients being admitted for&#xD;
      dofetilide or sotalol initiation as part of their routine clinical care. Any patient being&#xD;
      admitted to a participating institution for the purpose of dofetilide or sotalol initiation&#xD;
      will be eligible. Patients must be able to understand the risks of genetic testing, and be&#xD;
      willing to undergo a venipuncture for blood collection for genotyping. Exclusion criteria&#xD;
      include inability to provide informed consent. The investigators have a goal to enroll a&#xD;
      total of 1000 study participants across all collaborating centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be identified by investigators based on planned admission for dofetilide or&#xD;
      sotalol initiation, and following explanation of the study by co-investigator, will be asked&#xD;
      about study participation and informed consent will be obtained. Investigators will complete&#xD;
      a data collection form for each patient, which will include contact information, demographic&#xD;
      information, clinical information, family history and pedigree, and all electrocardiography&#xD;
      information available (tracings, reports). Patients will then undergo venipuncture, and two&#xD;
      5mL blood samples (tubes) will be collected for genotyping. Patients will also be consented&#xD;
      for future re-contact about additional data, information, or samples needed for analysis.&#xD;
