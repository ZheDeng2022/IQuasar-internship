  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will be conducted to further evaluate, in a controlled setting, potential cardiac&#xD;
      effects of an anticipated therapeutic and supra-therapeutic dose of BI 409306 under resting&#xD;
      and exercise conditions. Since the drug is being developed in part for a disease with an&#xD;
      expectedly high number of elderly (AD), the characterization of cardiac safety of BI 409306&#xD;
      is considered to be important for the development of this compound.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Beard or unwillingness to shave for the trial (to facilitate appropriate measurements&#xD;
             during CPX which requires wearing a face mask)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Physical disability that precludes safe and adequate CPX investigation&#xD;
