    <textblock>
      This is a two-arm Phase 1b feasibility trial consisting of 20 patients receiving the&#xD;
      combination of ipilimumab+nivolumab, either adjuvant, or split neo-adjuvant and adjuvant.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with stage III melanoma with palpable disease, naïve for CTLA-4/PD-1/PD-L1&#xD;
      immunotherapy, will be treated either post-surgery for 12 weeks with the combination of&#xD;
      ipilimumab+nivolumab or in a split design for 6 weeks upfront surgery and for 6 weeks&#xD;
      postsurgery. It is a two-arm Phase 1b feasibility trial consisting of 20 patients, 10 in each&#xD;
      arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At different timepoints tumor biopsies and blood for PBMCs will be taken for translational&#xD;
      research. Also scans will be done on specific timepoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be held to determine safety, feasibility, and the immune-activating capacity&#xD;
      of short-term combined neo-adjuvant and adjuvant ipilimumab + nivolumab. And to determine&#xD;
      relapse free survival (RFS), any late adverse events, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, and&#xD;
      the correlation between RFS and changes in neo-antigen specific T cell response.&#xD;

    <time_frame>12 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>To this purpose the immunogenic mutational load of each patient's melanoma will be determined by DNA and RNA sequencing from baseline biopsies (3x14g, 5ug tumor DNA). Proteasomal degradation and peptide presentation in HLA will be predicted in silico. MHC-tetramer staining containing the predicted peptides will be done as described before [2]. In addition, the effect of therapy on intratumoral T cell responses to obtain better insight into the mode of action of therapy will be analyzed. Identified neo-antigen specific T cells will be analyzed with respect to their phenotype and immunologic function (intracellular cytokine staining, lytic function as determined by CD107 staining, and coculture with APC presenting the cognate antigen).</description>
