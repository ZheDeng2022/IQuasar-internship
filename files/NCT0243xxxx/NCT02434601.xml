    <textblock>
      The surface of non-carious cervical lesions (LCNC) is a challenge to adhesive systems, it&#xD;
      presents a dentin layer sclera hypermineralized, presence of bacteria and lack of mechanical&#xD;
      retention, so this study aimed to evaluate the influence of different surface treatments on&#xD;
      LCNC through a randomized clinical trial. Patients with LCNC were referred to the study and&#xD;
      selected according to the inclusion criteria, such as the presence of at least 3 LCNC. Three&#xD;
      different types of surface treatment were carried out in LCNC: control group, 15 seconds of&#xD;
      etching dentin; Group I, acid etching of dentin in 30 seconds; and group II, cavity&#xD;
      prophylaxis with ultrasound for 30 seconds. The remaining steps of the adhesive and&#xD;
      restorative procedure was the same for all groups, following the material manufacturer's&#xD;
      recommendations. Evaluations of restorations will be carried out in periods of one week&#xD;
      (baseline), six months, one year, two years and three years as of tooth sensitivity,&#xD;
      integrity and color change. Data will be analyzed by McNemar and chi-square test.&#xD;

      Ethical considerations This study was designed and conducted according to the guidelines&#xD;
      Consolidated Standards of Reporting of Trials (CONSORT) for the preparation of randomized&#xD;
      controlled clinical trials (Altman et al., 2001), after approval by the Research Ethics&#xD;
      Committee (protocol number CEP-035 -2011- FO / UFPel), Faculty of Dentistry, Federal&#xD;
      University of Pelotas - RS / Brazil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculation for determining the sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the literature, the sample size was obtained assuming an average annual rate of&#xD;
      failure 6% for Class V restorations performed with conventional adhesive systems (PEUMANS et&#xD;
      al., 2005b), with 80% power and significance level of 5%. From the recommendations of the&#xD;
      American Dental Association (2010), we estimated an annual failure rate of 12% for&#xD;
      restorations in relative isolation. For this, a sample of 28 was determined by monitoring&#xD;
      patients for a minimum of 5 years, considering possible attrition of 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and selection of patients The search strategy of individuals interested in&#xD;
      participating in this clinical trial was conducted through the dissemination of the project&#xD;
      through the display of posters and distribution of pamphlets in FO / UFPEL as well as in&#xD;
      basic health units (BHU) located in the urban area Pelotas. In addition, the study had the&#xD;
      collaboration of students representatives of class associations, coordinating teachers of&#xD;
      clinical activities and dentists the public health system, to increase the receptivity and&#xD;
      the accession of potential volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were referred, or directly sought dental care, with diagnosis of non-carious&#xD;
      cervical lesion, were scheduled for evaluation exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two students of the seventh semester, under the supervision of the responsible of this study,&#xD;
      carried out the consultations on the premises of FO / UFPEL. Initially, the presence of LCNC&#xD;
      was assessed by visual inspection with wooden spatula aid. If so, we filled out a patient's&#xD;
      medical record, containing identification data, general and dental history. In addition, the&#xD;
      dental chart was performed using mirror, explorer, millimeter periodontal probe, clinical&#xD;
      tweezers, cotton rolls and saliva sucker. From the clinical examination, the LCNC were sorted&#xD;
      review of its features. The dentin sensitivity was evaluated by applying air jet for 3&#xD;
      seconds, the distance 2-3 cm of the labial surface, and sensitivity degree record from a&#xD;
      visual analogue scale. Likewise, the pulpal vitality was visualized using cotton balls&#xD;
      previously moistened with the gas jet cooling at -50 ° C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria received an information letter about&#xD;
      the nature and proposal of the study. After reading, we asked the volunteers to sign a&#xD;
      consent form and informed about their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a second clinic session, the patients underwent a process of adaptation of oral health for&#xD;
      the prevention, control, removal of plaque and dental calculus. Professional intervention&#xD;
      consisted in scraping, smoothing and polishing dental, using curettes / periodontal files,&#xD;
      glass / rubber cone, Robinson brush, prophylaxis paste and contra angle low speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operator training Six candidates for operators (students between the seventh and eighth&#xD;
      semester of FOUFPEL) participated in a training process to ensure the standardization of&#xD;
      clinical procedures and minimize the variation of different operators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First stage (theoretical): A lecture was given, lasting about two hours, consisting in the&#xD;
      presentation of materials and techniques for the removal or modification of hypermineralized&#xD;
      surface layer of dentin-carious cervical lesions. It was also performed routine detailed&#xD;
      statement to be instituted during the sessions. A manual containing the material operating&#xD;
      instructions and the protocol of clinical procedures, was made available to students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second stage (practice): Students went through pre-clinical activities, watching the&#xD;
      demonstration and subsequently performing Class V restorations on mannequins. Secondly, they&#xD;
      performed the same procedures for volunteers who, despite presenting LCNC with restorative&#xD;
      needs, were not included in this study. Therefore, such patients received restorative&#xD;
      treatment under conditions identical to the patients involved in the study, but not part of&#xD;
      the sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of training and calibration steps, the functions of the working group delegated by&#xD;
      using the performance of individual students as selection criteria. Were chosen two&#xD;
      operators, who have restorative procedures, and two assistants to support operators and&#xD;
      completion of medical records. The other students were in charge of sterilization of&#xD;
      instruments, scheduling appointments, molding, photographic record, oral hygiene orientation,&#xD;
      periodontal treatment, among other dental procedures offered to patients. All the above&#xD;
      mentioned steps were performed under direct supervision of the responsible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation of the patient: Four weeks before the start of the study, the patients were&#xD;
      subjected to a sweep session, smoothing and polishing supragingival. In addition, patients&#xD;
      received individualized instruction for mechanical control of dental biofilm, including&#xD;
      guidance on the brushing technique and flossing. During the monitoring period, was also&#xD;
      offered dental support to patients involved in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Protocol Initially, prophylaxis element to be restored was made with glass and&#xD;
      rubber based slurry of pumice and water. Then the color of the restoration was selected with&#xD;
      the aid of a color scale (Vitapan Classical, Vita Zahnfabrik, Bad Säckingen, Germany). Local&#xD;
      anesthesia was Also, when necessary. In the same query, the patient received restorative&#xD;
      action in three LCNC to submit clinical features compatible. Randomization as the technique&#xD;
      for the surface layer removal or modification hypermineralized to be applied in each place by&#xD;
      drawing lots. The restorations were initiated by the previous LCNC, with the priority needs,&#xD;
      the main complaint: aesthetic, functional aspects and / or symptoms such as tooth&#xD;
      sensitivity, etc. Each patient had to have at least 3 teeth to be restored because of the 3&#xD;
      types of treatments employed. It draw lots 3 treatments individually for each tooth. For&#xD;
      example, if a patient possessed the three lesions selected, the drawing is performed to be&#xD;
      selected for each tooth treatment be subjected to a treatment. If the patient possess more&#xD;
      than 3 lesions was performed again for the draw element 4 and so on with the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We emphasize also that each operator held the same number of restorative interventions, and&#xD;
      one was prepared following the protocol recommended by the manufacturer of the materials,&#xD;
      another increasing the etching time to 30 seconds on dentin and finally the third cavity was&#xD;
      restored after performing a cavity prophylaxis with ultrasound probe applied for 30 seconds.&#xD;
      The remaining steps were carried out following the protocol recommended by the manufacturer&#xD;
      of restorative materials employed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rubber dam was accomplished through the use of lip retractor, wire retractor # 000&#xD;
      (Ultrapak Cord, Ultradent, South Jordam, UT, USA), cotton rolls and saliva sucker. The first&#xD;
      element to be introduced in the oral cavity was the lip retractor, printing expulsion lips&#xD;
      and cheeks. Cotton rolls were positioned in the upper labial sulcus at the lower labial&#xD;
      sulcus and in the sublingual region, to absorb the saliva flow coming mainly from the major&#xD;
      salivary glands. The retractor wire is inserted into the gingival sulcus with the aid of&#xD;
      blunt spatula, without generating excessive pressure in the periodontium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the implementation of restoration, there has been no type of cavity preparation, or&#xD;
      beveling of cavosurface margins. However, each LCNC dentin surface was subjected to various&#xD;
      removal or modification of the techniques hypermineralized ultra-surface layer, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control Group: Restoration made following the protocol recommended by the manufacturer&#xD;
           of the materials;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experimental Group 1: Increase the etching time to 30 seconds, performed with phosphoric&#xD;
           acid gel at 37%, prior to application of the resin adhesive. The following steps to acid&#xD;
           etching followed the protocol recommended by the manufacturer of the materials;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experimental Group 2: Prophylaxis cavity with ultrasound probe, applied for 30 seconds&#xD;
           on the dentin surface hypermineralized of cervical lesions non-carious. Soon after, the&#xD;
           restoration was made following the protocol recommended by the manufacturer of the&#xD;
           materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both restorative procedures were performed using a conventional adhesive system (Single Bond&#xD;
      II, 3M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA) and composite restorative nanoparticulate (Filtek Z350, 3M&#xD;
      ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA), closely following the operating instructions provided by the&#xD;
      manufacturer. The restorations were placed by incremental technique using about 2 or 3&#xD;
      increments restorative composite, as the size of LCNC. The increments were taken and adapted&#xD;
      to the cavity starting with the margin in enamel with spatulas, brushes and siliconadas tips&#xD;
      for composite resin. An LED device with minimum intensity 1450 mW / cm2 was used for&#xD;
      polymerization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the finish of the restoration was performed by using # 12 scalpel blade, diamond and&#xD;
      fine-grained multi-laminated drills, in order to remove excess material and / or improve the&#xD;
      shape of the contour restorations. The polishing of the same was done with employment&#xD;
      siliconadas tips, floppies sandpaper (Sof-Lex Pop-On, 3M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA),&#xD;
      felt-specific folders and polishing discs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reviews of restorations Two examiners (graduated in Dentistry) will go through a training&#xD;
      process and calibration until present intra agreement index and inter-examiner of at least&#xD;
      80%. In the event of disagreement as to the assessment criteria, the same terião to get a&#xD;
      consensus through direct revaluation of restorations and / or by means of digital&#xD;
      photographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the training phase and calibration, the evaluators 'blind', ie without any involvement&#xD;
      with the conditions which patients will be submitted, shall proceed independently, clinical&#xD;
      evaluations of restorations. At this time, the evaluators will use magnifying glass, mirror,&#xD;
      explorer, millimeter periodontal probe, clinical tweezers, cotton rolls and saliva sucker.&#xD;
      Data relating to dentin sensitivity and pulp vitality will also be collected through the air&#xD;
      jet application and application cotton balls have been wetted with gas jet cooling to -50 °&#xD;
      C, respectively. Digital photographs will also be consulted by the evaluators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The properties will be evaluated sensitivity, color change and integrity of the restoration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Clinical evaluations will occur in the following periods: 1 week&#xD;
      (baseline), six months, a year, two years and three years after insertion of the restorations&#xD;
      using the evaluated criteria. The data will be tabulated and submitted to statistical&#xD;
      analysis, considering 80% power and 5% significance level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will be held descriptive analysis with calculation of ratios to characterize the sample and&#xD;
      dental restorations. To compare outcomes in the pre- and post-intervention according to the&#xD;
      treatment groups and also the comparison of outcome between treatment groups will be used&#xD;
      chi-square test and McNemar test. The analyzes will be performed using Stata 12.1 software.&#xD;
