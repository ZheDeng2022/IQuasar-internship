  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The FDA and Health Canada have approved regorafenib at a daily dose of 160mg for the&#xD;
      treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer and gastrointestinal stromal cancer; however, the&#xD;
      160 mg dose is not well tolerated by patients, especially women. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to determine if lean body mass and acidity in the intestinal tract impact how regorafenib is&#xD;
      absorbed into the bloodstream and then broken down and removed from the body. This may&#xD;
      explain the side effects experienced at the 160 mg dose, especially by women, and inform&#xD;
      regorafenib dosing in the future.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Numerous investigators have noted that the recommended flat dosing of regorafenib of 160 mg&#xD;
      orally, once daily is not well tolerated by patients, especially women. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to determine if there is a correlation between lean body mass and regorafenib&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and if so, then it may be possible to exploit this relationship to better&#xD;
      dose regorafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, Bayer has noted that regorafenib steady state levels were lower in&#xD;
      gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) patients than in patients with metastatic colorectal&#xD;
      cancer. GIST patients have often had gastrectomies that would lead to an elevated pH in the&#xD;
      intestinal tract. If regorafenib has a pH dependent solubility then lower regorafenib levels&#xD;
      could be due to reduced acidity. The purpose of the second part of the study is to examine&#xD;
      the regorafenib pharmacokinetic profile in patients treated with a proton pump inhibitor&#xD;
      (pantoprazole) for 7 days, mimicking the altered intestinal environment seen in GIST&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
