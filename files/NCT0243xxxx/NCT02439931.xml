  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Survivors of high grade brain tumours frequently experience increases in distress, cognitive&#xD;
      challenges, and lessened quality of life. At the same time a range of barriers can make it&#xD;
      challenging for these individuals to come into the clinic for appropriate psychosocial&#xD;
      support. The proposed study is therefore a feasibility study that is designed to develop a&#xD;
      manualized, remotely delivered psychosocial intervention for this population and then to test&#xD;
      the acceptability, feasibility, apparent efficacy, and areas for improvement of the developed&#xD;
      intervention. Further, a remote neuropsychological testing procedure will be developed and&#xD;
      implemented and analogous questions will be asked around this procedure.&#xD;

      Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
      There would be strong value in developing a brief, manualized, remotely delivered,&#xD;
      intervention capable of simultaneously improving both emotional well being and cognitive&#xD;
      functioning in survivors of malignant brain tumour. The proposed study is designed to test&#xD;
      the acceptability, feasibility, apparent efficacy, and areas for improvement of a newly&#xD;
      developed intervention designed for this purpose. This investigation is being undertaken as a&#xD;
      step toward conducting an randomized clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Questions&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a feasibility study there will be no hypotheses tested in this study. Instead, the&#xD;
      research will be conducted in order to answer the following four questions about the&#xD;
      intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How acceptable was the intervention?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How feasible was the intervention?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. How much apparent efficacy did the intervention have?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. How could the involved processes be improved?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further the following three questions will be asked around the remote neuropsychological&#xD;
      testing procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How feasible was the remote neuropsychological testing?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How valid was the remote neuropsychological testing?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. How could the neuropsychological testing processes be improved?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification&#xD;
&#xD;
      A general justification for the proposed research will be offered below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain tumour survivors demonstrate very high levels of psychopathology. For example, they&#xD;
      have been found to exhibit levels of clinical depression that are three times higher than&#xD;
      those found in cancer patients overall. This finding is particularly important because&#xD;
      symptoms of depression have also been found to be the strongest single predictor of overall&#xD;
      quality of life primary in brain tumour survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cognitive impacts of brain cancer, which are diverse, also have strongly negative effects&#xD;
      on quality of life. Impairments in the areas of memory, attention, and executive functioning&#xD;
      are the most common cognitive deficits involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite this depth of suffering, researchers to date have done relatively little work in&#xD;
      developing psychologically based interventions that can help to ameliorate these emotional&#xD;
      and cognitive sequelae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More specifically, the remote aspect of this intervention is justified by the fact that this&#xD;
      population faces multiple barriers to coming into the clinic for needed psychosocial care,&#xD;
      including: geographical isolation; cognitive impairment; driving prohibition; and fatigue.&#xD;
      This reality is reflected in the fact that previous researchers have reported facing faced&#xD;
      strong challenges in recruiting participants for time consuming intervention studies of this&#xD;
      kind in this population. A remote intervention may offer a means of overcoming this barrier&#xD;
      to access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, due to lengthy wait times and other factors, this is also a population that often&#xD;
      struggles to receive needed neuropsychological testing in a timely manner. Therefore, there&#xD;
      will also be value in validating a brief, remotely delivered neuropsychological testing&#xD;
      procedure in this population, above and beyond the role that doing so will play in validating&#xD;
      the particular intervention under investigation here.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has four primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to develop and deliver a remotely delivered psychosocial intervention to this high needs&#xD;
           population&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to develop a neuropsychological battery that can be remotely delivered to this same&#xD;
           population&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to answer the four questions listed above in regards to the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to answer the three questions listed above in regards to the neuropsych assessment&#xD;
           process&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed design will involve a mixed method feasibility study design. A variety of data&#xD;
      sources will be used in order to address the 7 research questions listed above. These data&#xD;
      sources will include: self report questionnaires; neuropsychological test batteries; fill-in&#xD;
      the blank questionnaires; interviews; and focus groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6) Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The included types of quantitative data analysis will be: descriptive statistics; effect&#xD;
      sizes; and repeated measures ANOVA.&#xD;
