      A two-arm, multicenter, prospective, randomized clinical trial of a lifestyle modification&#xD;
      program with tracked increased physical activity and weight loss (intensive) compared to&#xD;
      recommendations to tracking of increased physical activity alone with weight maintenance&#xD;
      (standard) in women with obesity and unexplained infertility. This 16 week period of&#xD;
      lifestyle modification will be followed by an open label empiric infertility treatment&#xD;
      regimen consisting of three cycles of ovarian stimulation with oral medication (clomiphene&#xD;
      citrate (CC)), triggering of ovulation with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and&#xD;
      intrauterine insemination (IUI).&#xD;

      Study Objective An intensive lifestyle modification intervention (which includes caloric&#xD;
      restriction, use of an over-the-counter weight loss medication, and moderate physical&#xD;
      activity with tracking) designed to promote a weight loss of approximately 7% of initial body&#xD;
      weight is more likely to achieve a good perinatal outcome (i.e. a healthy term normal weight&#xD;
      infant) than a recommendation to standard lifestyle modification with moderate physical&#xD;
      activity with tracking (based on publically available activity recommendations) in obese&#xD;
      women with unexplained infertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Population The population will consist of 380 obese women with unexplained&#xD;
      infertility, age 18-40 years old. Subjects must have normal ovulatory function and normal&#xD;
      ovarian reserve. Additionally, the couple will have no other major infertility factor: the&#xD;
      subject will have at least one patent fallopian tube and a normal uterine cavity, and a&#xD;
      partner total motile sperm count of at least 5 million in at least one ejaculate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This will be a two-arm, multicenter, prospective, randomized clinical trial of a&#xD;
      lifestyle modification program with tracked increased physical activity and weight loss&#xD;
      (intensive) compared to recommendations to tracking of increased physical activity alone with&#xD;
      weight maintenance (standard) in women with obesity and unexplained infertility. This 16 week&#xD;
      period of lifestyle modification will be followed by an open label empiric infertility&#xD;
      treatment regimen consisting of three cycles of ovarian stimulation with oral medication&#xD;
      (clomiphene citrate (CC)), triggering of ovulation with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)&#xD;
      and intrauterine insemination (IUI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment The intensive lifestyle modification intervention will consist of caloric&#xD;
      restriction (consumption of approximately 1200-1500 kcal/d), use of an over-the-counter&#xD;
      weight loss medication (Alli, which is brand name Orlistat, a gastric lipase inhibitor that&#xD;
      limits gut fat absorption), and moderate physical activity (goal of reaching 10,000 steps a&#xD;
      day). The pretreatment intervention will last 16 weeks and is designed to promote a weight&#xD;
      loss of approximately 7% of total body weight. Women in the standard lifestyle intervention&#xD;
      (standard) will receive publicly available written materials that promote engagement in&#xD;
      moderate physical activity with target of 10,000 steps a day. Detailed instruction of&#xD;
      physical activity will not be provided. Participants in both groups will receive activity&#xD;
      tracking devices (Fitbit Wireless Activity Tracker) and wireless scales (Fitbit Aria Wireless&#xD;
      Activity Scale) to promote adherence to the inventions and to allow monitoring for compliance&#xD;
      by study personnel. The pretreatment intervention will last 16 weeks. Both groups will aim&#xD;
      for activity levels of 10,000 steps/day, with a recommendation to increase steps from&#xD;
      baseline by 500 steps/per week. The investigators will monitor subjects monthly during this&#xD;
      preconception intervention. After 16 weeks of lifestyle modification, all subjects randomized&#xD;
      will receive a standardized empiric infertility treatment, regardless of adherence or success&#xD;
      in achieving treatment goals. This treatment will consist of ovarian stimulation with CC&#xD;
      followed by ultrasound follicular monitoring, hCG trigger of ovulation, and a single partner&#xD;
      intrauterine insemination (IUI) per treatment cycle for up to three treatment cycles. The&#xD;
      goal for both treatment groups will be to maintain levels of physical activity and weight&#xD;
      achieved during the pretreatment phase during the empiric infertility treatment phase.&#xD;
      Subjects who conceive will be followed throughout pregnancy with the wireless activity&#xD;
      monitor and wireless scale. Additionally there will be three brief onsite visits during&#xD;
      pregnancy (per trimester at 16, 24, and 32 weeks) for onsite determination of weight,&#xD;
      glycemic, and blood pressure changes and collection of biospecimens. All pregnancy outcomes&#xD;
      will be tracked. Subjects who deliver will be encouraged to donate placenta and cord blood to&#xD;
      the study repository and then to enroll in our Pregnancy Registry for continued infant&#xD;
      follow-up. The investigators will also expand the number and variety of specimens that are&#xD;
      collected for the repository from both partners including urine and serum, semen, saliva,&#xD;
      placenta and cord blood.&#xD;
