  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a significant need for nicotine cessation programs for pregnant women in Spokane&#xD;
      County. SCRIPT has been proven to be an effective method for smoking cessation in pregnant&#xD;
      women. This study will evaluate the success of SCRIPT delivered by pharmacists. At the end of&#xD;
      the study, the investigators hope to have three questions answered: 1) what is the quit rate&#xD;
      of pregnant women in the Spokane area who receive the SCRIPT intervention delivered by&#xD;
      pharmacists? 2) How does the quit rate compare to the quit rates of SCRIPT programs delivered&#xD;
      by other health care providers as documented in the literature? And 3) Does the SCRIPT&#xD;
      intervention have a significant effect on quit rates for pregnant women compared to current&#xD;
      Spokane county quit rates? Urine cotinine tests will be used to document smoking status&#xD;
      before delivery of the SCRIPT program, approximately one week after quit date and at &gt;36 wks&#xD;
      gestation or at delivery for study participants.&#xD;

      1. The goal of this project is to evaluate the success of pharmacists in delivering the&#xD;
      SCRIPT smoking cessation program. The research questions that need to be addressed are: i.&#xD;
      What is the quit rate of pregnant women in the Spokane area who receive the SCRIPT&#xD;
      intervention delivered by a pharmacist? ii. How does this quit rate compare to the quit rates&#xD;
      of other SCRIPT programs given by other health care providers (social workers, nurses, etc.)?&#xD;
      iii. Does the SCRIPT intervention have a significant effect on quit rates for smoking&#xD;
      pregnant women compared to current Spokane county quit rates?&#xD;

    <description>Participant will be shown a short DVD &quot;Commit to Quit: During and After Pregnancy. She will be given &quot;a Pregnant Woman's Guide to Quitting&quot; booklet.&#xD;
Participant will be asked their nicotine use status and it will be confirmed with a CO meter test and cotinine urine test. Those not consenting to be part of the study will not receive the urinalysis.&#xD;
Participant will be advised to quit smoking. The pharmacist will review the Guide with the participant. The participant will receive a phone call around the time of their quit/reduction date. The participant will meet again approximately one week after their quit/reduction date and receive a CO meter test and urine cotinine test.&#xD;
At the end of the program pregnant women will answer a follow-up questionnaire. Those women participating in the research study will be given a cotinine urine test at approximately &gt; 36 weeks gestation or at delivery.</description>
