    <textblock>
      The Patient Reported Outcomes, Burdens, and Experiences (PROBE) Study aims to develop a new&#xD;
      global tool to enhance the direct patient-voice in health care decision-making. Government&#xD;
      and private payers increasingly value data based on patient-centered outcomes research as&#xD;
      part of the overall cost-benefit evaluation of high-cost care and treatment of diseases such&#xD;
      as hemophilia. This emerging dimension of the healthcare environment presents a significant&#xD;
      opportunity and urgent need to improve patient organizations' ability to collect and&#xD;
      interpret relevant outcomes data. More robust patient reported data will improve advocacy&#xD;
      efforts to build comprehensive care programs, promote home treatment and implement&#xD;
      preventative treatment regimens thus allowing advocacy arguments to move beyond emotion and&#xD;
      anecdote to those grounded in real-world patient experiences and evidence. With the support&#xD;
      of the National Hemophilia Foundation, a global team of investigators will lead a patient&#xD;
      focused research project to investigate and directly probe patient perspectives on outcomes&#xD;
      they deem relevant to their care. Through PROBE, the investigators will develop and seek to&#xD;
      validate the reliability, reproducibility and responsiveness of a low cost, easily&#xD;
      administrable inventory for collecting patient self-reported outcomes, burdens and&#xD;
      experiences in living with hemophilia. The investigators anticipate that the metrics&#xD;
      established through PROBE will allow for comparison of patient outcomes within a country over&#xD;
      time and cross-sectionally between countries (regionally and globally).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PROBE is the repository of a standardized survey of patients with hemophilia from a group of&#xD;
      countries, to be run annually, collecting anonymized information on quality of life measures&#xD;
      and treatment modalities. After developing the tool in phase 1 of the project, a pilot&#xD;
      feasibility study is hereto described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale/Goals&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research based on patient-centered data is increasingly valued by government and private&#xD;
      payers and utilized in public-policy decisions as part of the cost-benefit justification for&#xD;
      high-cost care and treatment. A frequent question of payers is: Will additional investment&#xD;
      (to sustain or expand care) improve the lives of persons with hemophilia?&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a significant need to improve our ability to collect, collate, and interpret&#xD;
      relevant patient-centered data to support the implementation of comprehensive care, home&#xD;
      treatment and preventative treatment regimens (e.g., prophylaxis). The PROBE study is&#xD;
      intended to fill this gap and enhance the direct patient-voice in the delivery of care and&#xD;
      move advocacy efforts to sustain and expand care beyond emotion to arguments grounded in&#xD;
      evidence and data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall inventory and the specific metrics developed through PROBE will complement the&#xD;
      existing global comparative metrics of the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) as provided&#xD;
      in the WFH Global Survey (e.g., the percent of patients identified vs. expected within a&#xD;
      country, amount of treatment products available within a country on a per capita basis, and&#xD;
      the ratio of children to adults surviving into adulthood). While the WFH global metrics are&#xD;
      valued and useful, they do not provide a complete or direct insight as to how patients are&#xD;
      fairing within their health care system. The existing WFH metrics only serve as proxy&#xD;
      measures of the impact of care on patient outcomes within a country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROBE has an integrated knowledge translation component. This component will be manifested&#xD;
      through the development and validation of an inventory able to recode experiential data&#xD;
      contributed by patient organizations to a valid foundation for evidence-based decision making&#xD;
      (e.g. within Health Technology Assessments [HTAs]). PROBE will also be useful in raising&#xD;
      awareness within the community and the public of the impact of treatment for persons living&#xD;
      with hemophilia (PWH) and the value of effective prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GENERAL OBJECTIVES OF THE PROBE PROGRAM&#xD;
&#xD;
      The focus of PROBE will be to investigate and directly probe patient perspectives on outcomes&#xD;
      they deem relevant to their care. Through PROBE, the investigators will develop and seek to&#xD;
      validate the reliability, reproducibility and responsiveness of a low-cost, easily&#xD;
      administrable inventory for collecting patient self-reported outcomes, burdens and&#xD;
      experiences in living with hemophilia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A preliminary instrument definition and user testing phase has been completed. This phase has&#xD;
      involved an interactive workshop and take-home project utilizing economic concepts and&#xD;
      patient reported outcomes (PRO) collection techniques. The workshop was conducted on January&#xD;
      22-23 in Barcelona, Spain. During this workshop, participants partook in an exercise&#xD;
      utilizing the PROBE study draft questionnaire developed by the investigators and provided&#xD;
      feedback for refinement prior to its finalization for use in the pilot feasibility&#xD;
      assessment. During the workshop, the PROBE investigation team sought participant insight on&#xD;
      the questionnaire, proposed inventory and study methodology. The workshop also further&#xD;
      validated the overall PROBE study goals and better characterized the viability for patient&#xD;
      organizations to simply collect self-reported PRO data directly from PWH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this exercise, the research protocol was finalized, including inventory, metrics and&#xD;
      questionnaire for collection of inventory data. Questionnaire was translated into local&#xD;
      languages and explanatory materials to accompany questionnaire was developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire was developed based on the EQ-5D domains along with an abbreviated set of&#xD;
      supplemental questions looking at various demographics, treatment options, and the impacts of&#xD;
      hemophilia on a PWH's life.The final questionnaire integrates the EQ-5D-5L with additional&#xD;
      domains assessing the impacts of hemophilia on a PWH's life (e.g., pain, independence,&#xD;
      educational attainment, employment). The inventory domains, survey instruments, and normative&#xD;
      data / comparators selected were identified to reflect those customarily utilized by coverage&#xD;
      bodies (e.g. government / private payers, HTAs and Comparative Effectiveness Research). Where&#xD;
      feasible, the investigators incorporated generic instruments that are already widely accepted&#xD;
      by public policy makers. In developing the questionnaire, the investigators also reviewed&#xD;
      available information on questions utilized or published for other research studies and data&#xD;
      collection systems (e.g. ATHN, CDC, EHC, EUHASS, HERO, HUGS, WFH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CURRENT STUDY: PILOT FEASIBILITY STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot feasibility study to validate the proof of concept, assess reproducibility&#xD;
      and practicality of developing an inventory for large-scale assessment of patient-centered&#xD;
      outcomes in PWH. The investigators expect to be able to compare the effect of different&#xD;
      treatment delivery modalities and regimens on patient outcomes. The investigators anticipate&#xD;
      that the metrics established will allow for comparison of patient outcomes within a country&#xD;
      over time and cross-sectionally between countries (regionally and globally), thus providing&#xD;
      an important new tool to sustain and promote additional health care investment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve countries have been invited to participate i(Australia, New Zealand, France, Hungary,&#xD;
      Italy, Spain, The Netherlands, United Kingdom, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participating patient organization has committed to participate in this feasibility&#xD;
      project. Six will be selected based on capacity assessment of the local infrastructure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final questionnaire will be mailed to each of the participant organization in each of the&#xD;
      countries, and administered to 2 groups of 50 subject for each country, three months apart.&#xD;
      Questionnaire responses will be returned to a single independent site for analysis, where a&#xD;
      central data repository will be established and data analyst retained (McMaster University).&#xD;
      Demographic and treatment related information will be collected for correlation analysis and&#xD;
      to assess the discriminatory properties of the questionnaire components, but not included in&#xD;
      the final tool (inventory).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two moderate runs of the inventory will be conducted in each country three months apart to&#xD;
      demonstrate reproducibility (Approximately 600 PWH in total - 50 PWH per sampling exercise x&#xD;
      six countries x two test runs per country). Both paper and web versions will be developed&#xD;
      with translations as required. PWH will be recruited for participation via patient&#xD;
      organization contact database and their social media portals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reproducibility will be assessed based on an analysis of amount of variability within and&#xD;
      across sampling exercises with each country. Responsiveness will be assessed based on&#xD;
      response rate and percent complete responses. Reliability will be demonstrated by a combined&#xD;
      assessment of measurements for the primary outcomes (e.g. response rate, complete responses,&#xD;
      agreement between exercises, completion time, cost and feasibility of execution.) (See:&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Variables / Measurement Of Results section below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be collected at the individual level, but responses will be de-identified and&#xD;
      aggregated to perform comparison of outcomes at the population level rather than to allow&#xD;
      comparison of outcomes at the individual patient level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PROBE inventory will ideally complement and enhance the utility of the WFH database,&#xD;
      providing the opportunity to build a country specific rich data set for comparisons of&#xD;
      patient-centered outcomes and provide critical data to support advocacy efforts to improve&#xD;
      morbidity, mortality and overall quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Future applications could include development of a WFH Global Survey style report every 2-3&#xD;
      years providing updated comparative data or a WFH training monograph to support a wider&#xD;
      roll-out of the PROBE inventory with National Member Organizations. Additionally, the&#xD;
      inventory could be routinely conducted both before commencing and after completion of a&#xD;
      country development initiative (e.g. WFH GAP) or implementation of a major health care reform&#xD;
      impacting PWH (e.g. introduction of prophylaxis or home treatment) to monitor and compare the&#xD;
      impact on patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once validated, PROBE will establish a mechanism to make the inventory widely available for&#xD;
      use within the hemophilia community. However, the specific mechanism to make the PROBE&#xD;
      questionnaire and its related methodology available has not yet been established. This may&#xD;
      include a system requesting prior consent to use and/or developing a mechanism for&#xD;
      collaborative studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each country will be permitted to determine their target population for the take-home&#xD;
      project. The PROBE Investigators will provide guidance on study population parameters, as&#xD;
      required. Patients will be recruited according to the final inclusion criteria. No&#xD;
      randomization will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be approximately 600 PWH in total. The number of PWH participating in each country&#xD;
      project will be variable. As this aspect of the PROBE study is an exercise to better&#xD;
      understand best practices and obtain learning from execution of patient-centered research in&#xD;
      country the number of participants has not been assessed as critical. This number of PWH&#xD;
      (600) assumes 12 countries participate in the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moderate / Severe PWH (Age bands or limits may be utilized to narrow the study population).&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited according to the final inclusion criteria. No randomization will&#xD;
      be required. Two moderate to large test runs of the inventory will be conducted in each&#xD;
      country three months apart to demonstrate reproducibility (Approximately 600 PWH in total =&#xD;
      50 PWH per &quot;sampling exercise&quot; x six countries x two test runs per country). PWH&#xD;
      participating in each of the two test runs may, but would not necessarily be the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When normative data are not available for comparison to the general population, the&#xD;
      investigators will consider strategies to produce a comparator (e.g. surveying non-effected&#xD;
      siblings). They will also explore suitable data from other chronic conditions to support the&#xD;
      aim of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study results will include an assessment of the adequacy of the small sample size to achieve&#xD;
      reproducibility. The study design is intended to describe characteristics generally within&#xD;
      the overall study population and not to test for differences in certain attributes of&#xD;
      subgroups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria - For both phases, PWH will be recruited through national hemophilia&#xD;
      patient organizations utilizing their existing membership rosters, social media outlets and&#xD;
      meetings / events. The investigators are not proposing a pre-determined method of PWH&#xD;
      recruitment. They will utilize the the information gathered in the workshop and take-home&#xD;
      project to inform best practice in recruitment methodology for the next steps of the project.&#xD;
      The investigators may consider requesting different countries test different PWH recruitment&#xD;
      strategies to test reproducibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria - Disease severity and Age bands or age limits (e.g. ≥ Age 18) may be&#xD;
      utilized to narrow the study population. During the January 2015 meeting of the investigators&#xD;
      the inclusion / exclusion criteria will be finalized based on feedback learned during the&#xD;
      workshop. Disease severity will be based on patient self-reported severity level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OUTCOME VARIABLES / MEASUREMENT OF RESULTS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Response rate (number returned questionnaires/number sent)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percent complete responses (number answered question/number answerable questions)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to completion (self-reported completion time, as median and IQR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administrative cost per completed survey (human resources used and dollar-equivalent&#xD;
           spent to run the survey)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OTHER STUDY ELEMENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Protected Patient Information - Customary processes will be implemented to protect&#xD;
           individual patient identify. No identifiable patient information will be disclosed as&#xD;
           part of the study. Data will be collected at the individual PWH level, but responses&#xD;
           will be de-identified and aggregated to perform comparison of outcomes at the population&#xD;
           level rather than to allow comparison of outcomes at the individual PWH level. Aggregate&#xD;
           research results and periodic project updates will be provided to the sponsor. Raw data&#xD;
           that could be attributable to individual respondents will not be provided. Independent&#xD;
           management and autonomy from sponsor will be assured throughout the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse Event Reporting - Although it is not anticipated that the PROBE Study Team would&#xD;
           receive reports of adverse events within the scope of the Study, if the Investigators&#xD;
           are made aware of an adverse event involving a product manufactured by a study sponsor&#xD;
           through the conduct of the study, the Investigators commit to notify sponsor within one&#xD;
           (1) business day of actually becoming aware of any significant product complaint,&#xD;
           unexpected adverse event, or governmental investigation or inquiry involving a sponsor's&#xD;
           product.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval - Given the study design only contemplates&#xD;
           patients and/or patient organizations directly collecting data from patients and that&#xD;
           there is no planned direct Clinician / Hemophilia Treatment Center patient data&#xD;
           collection, the investigators do not anticipate the need to require local patient&#xD;
           organizations to obtain an IRB approval. They are aware of other global&#xD;
           patient-to-patient studies similar to PROBE where IRB approval has not been required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two of the primary outcome measures for PROBE are cost and time to completion of the Study.&#xD;
      To achieve our goal of developing a low-cost, easily administrable inventory, the&#xD;
      investigators will be striving to design a streamlined easily deployable system with minimal&#xD;
      up from cost and administrative burdens. PROBE will be mindful that local laws and practices&#xD;
      may vary and where required the investigators will comply with local practice for similar&#xD;
      type studies. If in the course of PROBE the investigators determine protocols will change&#xD;
      sufficiently to require IRB approval the investigators will do so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FUTURE STEPS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect PROBE to be used to perform three comparisons: among countries,&#xD;
      within country over time, within country against national normative data. The investigators&#xD;
      will preliminarily assess if normative data are available for the domains explored via&#xD;
      existing instruments. When normative data are not available, the investigators will consider&#xD;
      strategies to produce a comparator (e.g. surveying non-effected siblings). They will also&#xD;
      explore suitable data from other chronic conditions to support the aim of the study. They&#xD;
      will conduct a sensitivity analysis to assess the sufficiency of the inventory to measure&#xD;
      changes on the impact of care within populations of PWH or overtime using data collected from&#xD;
      disease specific questions in the PROBE questionnaire in combination with the EQ-5D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After demonstrating feasibility, a centralized data collection point will be established.&#xD;
      Initial data compilation and cleaning of the database will be incorporated within the&#xD;
      web-platform development and reporting agreement (e.g. McMaster University). An analyst&#xD;
      experienced in analysis of EQ-5D data and the related study domains will conduct an initial&#xD;
      analysis. The Investigators will then evaluate the data and determine the final comparisons&#xD;
      and correlations for analysis. Supplemental analyses, data correlation and reporting will&#xD;
      utilize / be contracted for with a university biostatics or health outcomes department&#xD;
      experienced in similar studies (e.g. McMaster University, University of Southern California,&#xD;
      North Carolina State University).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication plan. The investigators plan to discuss the study results in an end-of-study&#xD;
      meeting. A paper will be submitted to Haemophilia summarizing the research findings.&#xD;
      Abstracts, posters and requests for oral presentation will be considered for relevant&#xD;
      national, regional and international meetings (e.g., EAHAD, EHC, ISPOR, ISTH, NHF, and WFH).&#xD;
      They will report the research findings to the participating patient organizations and once&#xD;
      validated PROBE will establish a mechanism to make the inventory widely available for use&#xD;
      within the hemophilia community.&#xD;
&#xD;

             requesting different countries test different PWH recruitment strategies to test&#xD;
             reproducibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disease severity and Age bands or age limits (e.g. ≥ Age 18) may be utilized to narrow&#xD;
             the study population. During the January 2015 meeting of the investigators the&#xD;
             inclusion / exclusion criteria will be finalized based on feedback learned during the&#xD;
             workshop. Disease severity will be based on patient self-reported severity level.&#xD;
