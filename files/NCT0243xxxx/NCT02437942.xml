  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Athletic groin pain (AGP) is a chronic condition common in multi-directional sports (Walden&#xD;
      et al. 2007, Robinson et al. 2004, Murphy et al. 2012). It is a complex injury with a&#xD;
      challenging diagnosis. Dramatic differences in the anatomical diagnoses of AGP cohorts exist&#xD;
      in the literature (Renstrom et al. 1980, Lovell et al. 1995, Holmich et al. 2007, Bradshaw et&#xD;
      al. 2008). This may be due to the complexity of the anatomy in the region and the absence of&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGE) to confirm clinical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dynamic actions undertaken in field sports (including change of direction cutting) are&#xD;
      particularly associated with the development of athletic groin pain (Holmich et al. 2014).&#xD;
      Dynamic multi-plane, multi-joint actions can overload musculoskeletal and fascial structures&#xD;
      in the hip and groin. Despite this, traditional groin pain assessments do not involve an&#xD;
      examination of sport specific actions. An examination of jumping, hopping and cutting&#xD;
      mechanics, which is possible with the use of three dimensional motion capture techniques,&#xD;
      will provide additional information with which to diagnosis and rehabilitate athletes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the majority of published studies on AGP have focused on surgical management (Serner et&#xD;
      al. 2015), exercise therapy has been found to be an effective treatment (Holmich et al.&#xD;
      1995). In exercise therapy studies the best results were shown by Holmich et al (1995) where&#xD;
      subjects suffered for an average of 9.9 months with symptoms and a strength and stability&#xD;
      program focused on adductor strength returned them to sport in 18.5 weeks. The latest paper&#xD;
      on rehabilitation by Jardi et al. demonstrates little improvement with a mean time to return&#xD;
      to training of 86 days +/-15. The focus remains on improving strength of isolated muscle&#xD;
      groups and not attempting to address underlying biomechanical abnormalities that may be&#xD;
      leading to overload. Accurate biomechanical assessment and individualized rehabilitation&#xD;
      based on the high speed multiplanar movements that drive the athlete's symptoms may enhance&#xD;
      the efficiency of rehabilitation. Moreover post-rehabilitation changes in biomechanical&#xD;
      factors may provide a further insight into the biomechanical factors associated with AGP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study was to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Describe clinical presentation (physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
           findings) for a group of athletes presenting with AGP&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To describe the different biomechanical diagnoses that exist in AGP patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To examine the effects of a biomechanics led exercise intervention to rehabilitate&#xD;
           chronic groin pain&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesised that standardised magnetic resonance imaging will aid in the anatomical&#xD;
      diagnosis of athletic groin pain patients. From a biomechanics perspective, distinct&#xD;
      subgroups/clusters will exist that differ from each other in how they undertake dynamic sport&#xD;
      specific actions. These distinct clusters will describe potential biomechanical diagnoses&#xD;
      that exist in groin pain patients. A biomechanics led rehabilitation program will return&#xD;
      groin pain patients back to sport more quickly than previous rehabilitation programs without&#xD;
      biomechanical diagnostic information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief protocol Participants will be recruited from patients with chronic athletic groin pain&#xD;
      who present for investigation and rehabilitation at Sports Surgery Clinic, Ireland. A&#xD;
      standardised clinical examination will be undertaken including range of motion assessment,&#xD;
      pain provocation and load tolerance tests, and palpation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Magnetic Resonance Image of the hip and groin region will then be undertaken and read by a&#xD;
      consultant sports physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomechanical assessment will include capturing of jumping, hopping and cutting mechanics&#xD;
      through the use of three dimensional motion capture technology and force plates. Here&#xD;
      reflective markers are placed on the skin at anatomical landmarks. These markers are picked&#xD;
      up by the cameras and tracked at 200 frames per second. Participants will contact the force&#xD;
      plate with their foot on undertaking the movements. Force and marker data will be combined to&#xD;
      calculate joint angles and moments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical therapy assessment will include an assessment of functional movement, range of&#xD;
      motion testing, adductor squeeze tests, strength assessment of hip and trunk.&#xD;
      Physiotherapists will utilise three dimensional biomechanical data during cutting and landing&#xD;
      to inform individualised rehabilitation. Rehabilitation will consist of movement control,&#xD;
      whole body strength and power, linear running mechanics, multi-directional mechanics and&#xD;
      conditioning sessions. Participants will have follow up physical therapy appointments&#xD;
      approximately every two weeks. A hip and groin outcome score (HAGOS) will be used to monitor&#xD;
      the morbidity and severity of the injury throughout the rehabilitation process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the physiotherapist determines that the patient is ready to return to play a&#xD;
      biomechanical re-test will be undertaken.&#xD;

      Detailed Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following assessments will be undertaken by a consultant sports physician during the&#xD;
      initial clinical examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hip joint range of motion (flexion, internal and external rotation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Flexion ADduction Internal Rotation (FADIR) and Flexion ABduction External Rotation&#xD;
           (FABER) tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Squeeze tests (resisted adduction) at 90, 45 and 0 degrees were performed (SQ90°, SQ45°&#xD;
           and SQ0° respectively)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resisted sit up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prone internal and external rotation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gaenslen's test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hip extension&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Femoral slump&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thomas test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Palpation of the adductor insertion to tubercle, pubic symphysis and superficial ring&#xD;
           with resisted oblique sit up and deep ring scrotal invagination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The crossover test Radiological examination will include magnetic resonance imaging of&#xD;
           …..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomechanical testing involves the following progressive neuromuscular challenge tests which&#xD;
      are undertaken after the clinical examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Countermovement jump - Vertical jump as high as possible&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single leg drop landing - Hop from a 30cm height onto one leg and hold the landing for&#xD;
           2sec&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hurdle hop - Lateral hop over a 15cm hurdle followed by a hop back to the starting&#xD;
           position and a hold for 2sec&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change of direction cut - Sprint for 5 metres, make a 75 degree acute change of&#xD;
           direction and sprint for a further five meters to the finish&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Indecision cut - Sprint for three meters then react to a light stimulus and make a 90&#xD;
           degree cut to the left or right for a further 1.5metres&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hip and groin outcome score (HAGOS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Marx activity rating scale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical therapy assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single leg squat&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Straight leg raise&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hip strength testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hip range of motion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Squeeze test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Crossover test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Linear running analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Details&#xD;
&#xD;
      Movement Control Focusing on the deficits in large compound movement patterns evident during&#xD;
      assessment as well as hip and trunk control deficits. High emphasis placed on the technical&#xD;
      quality with which the sessions were carried out. Particular focus on pelvic control while&#xD;
      improving sagittal and frontal plane hip and lumbopelvic control. Any symptoms during&#xD;
      exercises indicates poor technique and the exercise will be reviewed and intensity reduced&#xD;
      until appropriate technique achieved. The rep and set ranges reflected the emphasis on&#xD;
      control while improving range at the thoracic spine, hip and ankle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strength-Power Double leg and single leg strength training carried out as necessary. Good&#xD;
      form instructed throughout to ensure appropriate hip strategy especially under high load.&#xD;
      Power work included single leg plyometric exercises to reduced ground contact and improve&#xD;
      stiffness throughout the kinetic chain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Linear Running Linear running drills focused on optimizing lumbo pelvic control in all three&#xD;
      planes identified during assessment. Commence with wall drills and marching and skipping and&#xD;
      progressing onto sled and harness drills which facilitate developing optimal posture with&#xD;
      increased rate of force development and ground reaction forces to improve performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multi Directional Multidirectional drills will be used to provide a neuromuscular challenge&#xD;
      to the trunk on pelvis and hip control as well as optimizing foot position and the ability to&#xD;
      control the centre of mass relative to the stance leg to reduce hip and pelvic overload and&#xD;
      optimise cutting performance. Higher intensity cutting drills will be included as a&#xD;
      progression once a painfree squeeze at 90 degrees has been achieved and symmetrical hip&#xD;
      internal rotation bilaterally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conditioning With a view to ensuring all aspects of the athletes performance are addressed,&#xD;
      conditioning will be carried out on a stationary bike to allow sufficient intensity without&#xD;
      overloading the pubic/groin region. Sessions will be prescribed from Maximal Aerobic Power&#xD;
      assessment on a wattbike and focused on alternate maximal and supramaximal sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hip and Groin Outcome Score (HAGOS) and MARX activity rating scale A HAGOS and MARX&#xD;
      questionnaire will be completed by each groin patient on every visit -approximately every two&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Registry&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient data will be inputted into iMedDoc medical data management software. Captured data&#xD;
      will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient information - doubly de-identified patient code, electronic scan of consent form,&#xD;
      anthropometric data, sport, playing position and playing level, time with pain, pain side or&#xD;
      bilateral pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sports medicine consultants findings - Diagnosis, magnetic resonance imaging findings,&#xD;
      findings of clinical examination Physiotherapist's findings - clinical examination findings&#xD;
      for initial test and post-rehabilitation HAGOS - hip and groin outcome score for initial test&#xD;
      and throughout rehabilitation MARX activity rating scale - for initial test and throughout&#xD;
      rehabilitation Magnetic resonance image files Quality assurance plan Weekly cross-checking&#xD;
      will be undertaken by two members of staff to ensure data entered onto the registry is&#xD;
      correct as per paper records and per acceptable ranges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A six-monthly audit of the registry will be undertaken by external auditors (Dr Kieran Moran,&#xD;
      Dublin City University and Dr Siobhan Strike, Roehampton University).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registry standard operating procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic patient contact details are inputted by administration staff Patient consent form is&#xD;
      uploaded to imeddoc software Doctors and physiotherapists input physical examination findings&#xD;
      on imeddoc software HAGOS and Marx activity questionnaire are inputted by the patient using a&#xD;
      tablet device. This data is uploaded to imeddoc automatically once questionnaire is&#xD;
      completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data is downloaded from imeddoc and placed into Microsoft excel. Patient name is&#xD;
      de-identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two researchers manage the registry updates and cross-check the data on a weekly basis. Where&#xD;
      applicable paper records are checked to ensure the information submitted to the registry is&#xD;
      complete and is within acceptable ranges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A six-monthly audit of the registry will be undertaken by external auditors (Dr Kieran Moran,&#xD;
      Dublin City University, Ireland and Dr Siobhan Strike, University of Roehampton, London).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size assessment to specify the number of participants or participant years necessary&#xD;
      to demonstrate an effect Suggested sample size = 600 Biomechanical clustering techniques&#xD;
      (which will be used to describe the different biomechanical diagnoses that exist in AGP&#xD;
      patients) require relatively large numbers of participants. Previous studies have utilised an&#xD;
      n = 588 for this purpose (Sutherland and Davids), therefore it is hypothesised that 600 will&#xD;
      be sufficient for such an analysis in the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of n = 600 will allow a comprehensive examination of the clinical presentation&#xD;
      of groin pain. Previous studies have only utilised up to 218 participants (Bradshaw et al&#xD;
      2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, a sample size of 600 will be sufficient to account for drop out from the&#xD;
      rehabilitation intervention. Drop out may be relatively high due to the regular physical&#xD;
      therapy contact required (approximately every 2 weeks) despite the wide geographical spread&#xD;
      of participants (throughout Ireland).&#xD;
