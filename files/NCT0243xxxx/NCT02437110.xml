      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Some people with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) have a high level of the virus HERV-K&#xD;
      in their blood. Researchers do not think this virus causes ALS. But they don t know why some&#xD;
      people with ALS have a high level of it. They want to know if HERV-K can be suppressed by&#xD;
      drugs that are used to treat HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To learn how drugs usually taken for HIV infection affect people with Amyotrophic Lateral&#xD;
      Sclerosis (ALS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults at least 18 years old with ALS and high levels of HERV-K but no HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interested participants can contact the study team and, if eligible, the study team will&#xD;
           arrange for a screening blood draw to determine the HERV-K level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with a high HERV-K level will be screened with medical history, physical&#xD;
           exam, questionnaires, nerve conduction test, lumbar puncture, and blood and breathing&#xD;
           tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After screening, participants will start taking the 4 study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have up to 12 study visits over a period of 72 weeks. After starting&#xD;
           study drugs, they will have study visits at Weeks 1 and 4 and then every 4 weeks until&#xD;
           Week 28. They will be asked how they are feeling and have an exam and blood drawn. At 3&#xD;
           visits, they will have tests of nerve conduction, breathing, and their ALS symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At Week 24, they will stop taking the study drugs and have a repeat lumbar puncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the Week 48 visit, their participation is finished.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this Phase I, proof-of-concept study, we aim to determine whether an antiretroviral&#xD;
      regimen approved to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection would also suppress&#xD;
      levels of Human Endogenous Retrovirus-K (HERV-K) found to be activated in a subset of&#xD;
      patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We propose to measure the of blood levels&#xD;
      of HERV-K by quantitative PCR before, during, and after treatment with an antiretroviral&#xD;
      regimen. We will evaluate the safety of the antiretroviral regimen for participants with ALS&#xD;
      and also explore clinical and neurophysiological outcomes of ALS symptoms, quality of life,&#xD;
      and pulmonary function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will study a subset of ALS patients who have a ratio of HERV-K:RPP30 greater than or equal&#xD;
      to 13. About 30% of ALS patients may have detectable levels of HERV-K; about 20% of patients&#xD;
      with ALS have a level &gt;1000 copies/ml. To show whether the HERV-K could be suppressed, we&#xD;
      will recruit from the approximately 20% of patients with the high levels so that the&#xD;
      antiretroviral effect can be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label study of a combination antiretroviral therapy for 24 weeks in 25&#xD;
      HIV-negative, HTLV-negative ALS patients with high ratio of HERV-K:RPP30. The study duration&#xD;
      for each participant will be up to 72 weeks. Participants will be followed regularly for&#xD;
      safety, clinical, and neurophysiological outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be the percent decline HERV-K concentration measured by&#xD;
      quantitataive PCR. Percent decline for a patient is measured by: 100 x (screening visit -&#xD;
      week 24 visit measurement) / screening visit. The safety of antiretrovirals in volunteers&#xD;
      with ALS as measured by the frequency and type of AEs, the ability to remain on assigned&#xD;
      treatment (tolerability), physical examinations, laboratory test results, vital signs, and&#xD;
      weight/body mass index (BMI). Efficacy will be explored by measuring the change in mean&#xD;
      scores of: the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R), the ALS Specific Quality of&#xD;
      Life Inventory-Revised (ALSSQOL-R), the ALS Cognitive Behavioral Screen (ALS-CBS), vital&#xD;
      capacity and maximal inspiratory pressure as measured by handheld spirometer, electrical&#xD;
      impedance myography (EIM), the change in neurofilament levels in blood and/or CSF, and the&#xD;
      change in uring p75ECD levels.&#xD;
