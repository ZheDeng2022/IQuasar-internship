    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of entinostat used in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab in patients with Non-small Cell Lung Cancer. Additionally the&#xD;
      purpose of the study is to assess how effective entinostat and pembrolizumab are in&#xD;
      combination in patients with Non-small Cell Lung Cancer, Melanoma, and Mismatch-Repair&#xD;
      Proficient Colorectal Cancer&#xD;

    <textblock>
      SNDX-275-0601 is an open-label, Phase 1b/2 study evaluating the combination of entinostat&#xD;
      plus pembrolizumab in patients with advanced metastatic or recurrent NSCLC or melanoma or&#xD;
      mismatch repair-proficient colorectal cancer. The study has 2 phases, a Dose&#xD;
      Escalation/Confirmation Phase (Phase 1b) and an Expansion Phase (Phase 2). An additional&#xD;
      cohort (Entinostat Monotherapy Immune Correlate [EMIC] Cohort) evaluating single agent&#xD;
      entinostat for 2 weeks followed by the combination will also be evaluated in patients with&#xD;
      NSCLC in the Phase 2 expansion phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicities will be assessed by the Investigator using the United States (US) National Cancer&#xD;
      Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.03.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Confirmation: The prospective MTD/RP2D identified in the Dose Escalation Phase will be&#xD;
      confirmed in 9 patients in Dose Confirmation Cohort(s) to obtain additional AE, immune&#xD;
      correlate, and anti-tumor activity data on entinostat in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 (Expansion): In the Expansion Phase, entinostat in combination will be evaluated&#xD;
      using the RP2D identified in the Dose Escalation/Confirmation Phase. Up to 3 Expansion&#xD;
      Cohorts consisting of distinct subsets of patients with solid tumor cancers may be explored.&#xD;
      Expansion cohorts may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cohort 1: NSCLC&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cohort 2: Patients with NSCLC (any histology) who have previously been treated and&#xD;
           responded and then progressed on either a PD-1 or PD-L1-blocking antibody&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cohort 3: Patients with melanoma who have previously been treated with and unequivocally&#xD;
           progressed on either a PD-1 or PD-L1-blocking antibody&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Cohort 4: Patients with CRC (mismatch repair-proficient) who have not been previously&#xD;
           treated with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody&#xD;
&#xD;
      EMIC Cohort: 15 NSCLC patients Stage 2 of Cohort 1 will be randomly assigned to participate.&#xD;
