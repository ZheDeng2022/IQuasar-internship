  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease is a well established therapy. Current&#xD;
      practice requires tedious adjustment of stimulation settings based on frequent patient&#xD;
      assessments. Ultimately, the goal is to develop a system that can program itself using&#xD;
      signals that are recorded directly from the brain on a continuous basis. Our previous work&#xD;
      has identified abnormal electrical signals in the brain that are targeted for stimulation&#xD;
      that can potentially be used to develop a self-programming system. In this study, the&#xD;
      investigators will test the safety and utility of a novel adapted device that can not only&#xD;
      deliver stimulation to the brain but also record brain signals in a patient that is implanted&#xD;
      with a deep brain stimulation system. The purpose of this Phase I study is to understand the&#xD;
      safety of the device as well as the relationship between these electrical signals measured&#xD;
      from deep within the brain and Parkinson's symptoms and how these signals can be used to&#xD;
      guide a self-programmed system. The study will entail implanting this special device (Activa&#xD;
      PC+S) in place of the standard generator (Activa PC) and to compare clinical symptoms,&#xD;
      recorded brain signals, and stimulation patterns during a one year period after implantation.&#xD;
      Specifically, the investigators will use the Activa PC+S to record GPi (internal globus&#xD;
      pallidus) local field potentials between and during programming visits, allowing the surgeon&#xD;
      to better characterize a patient's disease. At the same time, the investigators will evaluate&#xD;
      the safety of this new device.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The device being tested is the Activa Primary Cell and Sensing (PC+S) system which consists&#xD;
      of a deep brain stimulation (DBS) generator, specially adapted extension leads, and DBS leads&#xD;
      implanted in the globus pallidus internus (GPi) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).&#xD;
      The Activa PC+S system differs from currently FDA-approved devices in that it is not only&#xD;
      capable of delivering therapeutic stimulation through the DBS leads but also recording&#xD;
      electrophysiological signals through the same leads. The goal of this pilot study is to&#xD;
      evaluate (1) to assess the specificity and stability of the electrophysiological signals&#xD;
      recorded with the Activa PC+S system, (2) how the signals recorded by this system correlate&#xD;
      with clinical parameters and non-invasive measures of movement, and (3) and the safety of the&#xD;
      PC+S system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Medtronic Activa Primary Cell (PC) DBS system has a proven record of safety and&#xD;
      reliability through extensive human clinical use over the years1. The potential risks&#xD;
      associated with the placement and the use of the device have been thoroughly described in&#xD;
      previous human trials and retrospective reports. The PC+S device is based on the currently&#xD;
      approved device but with added sensing capabilities. In this protocol, we will evaluate the&#xD;
      Activa PC+S system using additional sensing components with stimulation parameters commonly&#xD;
      used for the treatment of movement disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will follow a non-randomized design with rigorous and comprehensive follow-ups, as&#xD;
      described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and associated&#xD;
      facilities through the combined neurology and neurosurgery movement disorders program, which&#xD;
      manages over 1,000 patients with PD. The study will provide close follow-up of patients after&#xD;
      DBS surgery by a team involving functional neurosurgeons and neurologists with expertise in&#xD;
      clinical care of patients with PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be screened according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Each patient will be&#xD;
      informed about the study to see if they are interested in participating. After the patient&#xD;
      signs the informed consent, they will undergo baseline evaluations, and if they qualify, they&#xD;
      will undergo surgery to implant the deep brain stimulation system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After device implantation, patients will complete comprehensive follow-up as described in the&#xD;
      protocol below. The patients will return to the clinic at least monthly for the first 3&#xD;
      months for on and off medication assessments and programming. Primary assessments will be&#xD;
      administered monthly for the first 3 months, and then every 3 months up to 12 months&#xD;
      post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LFPs will be recorded across time (intraoperative, during programming, and chronically),&#xD;
      across activity states (with quantitative accelerometer and gyroscope measurements), and&#xD;
      across disease states (off and on medication, off and on stimulation) to address the primary&#xD;
      research questions proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comparison of measures within the same person from pre-treatment to post-treatment will be&#xD;
      performed. Also, pre-treatment and post-treatment group means and standard deviations will be&#xD;
      determined. Correlations between LFP biosignals and non-invasive measures and clinical&#xD;
      assessment of movement will be performed. In addition, correlation between LFP signals and&#xD;
      clinically-defined stimulation parameters will be evaluated.&#xD;
