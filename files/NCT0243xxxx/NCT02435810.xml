      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Inflammation is how the body reacts to infection or injury. . Infections or inflammation in&#xD;
      the brain and nerves can be serious. There aren t always good tests to detect this.&#xD;
      Researchers want to learn more about how diseases affect the brain and nerves to develop&#xD;
      better tests and treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To learn more about how inflammation and infections hurt the brain and nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People at least 2 years old with a diagnosis or suspected diagnosis of nervous system&#xD;
      infection or inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For some participants, a clinician outside of NIH will collect blood, tissue, and other&#xD;
           samples. These will be sent to NIH and analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other participants will have several visits to NIH. Children may not have all these&#xD;
           tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical and neurological exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine samples collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Saliva collected. They will chew on a piece of sterile cotton for one minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The scanner is a metal cylinder in a strong&#xD;
           magnetic field. Participants will lie on a table that slides in and out of the cylinder.&#xD;
           Participants will get a contrast agent through an intravenous (IV) catheter during the&#xD;
           MRI. A needle will be used to guide a thin plastic tube (catheter) into an arm vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lumbar puncture. Skin will be numbed and a needle will be inserted into the space&#xD;
           between the bones in the back. Fluid will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some participants may have optional study procedures. These may include eye tests,&#xD;
           memory and thinking testing, tests with electrodes on the head, or skin biopsy.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to examine the natural course of infectious and inflammatory&#xD;
      diseases of the nervous system, to identify causative or associated pathogens when unknown,&#xD;
      and generally to better understand the underlying immunological, genetic and pathophysiologic&#xD;
      mechanisms that cause and contribute to these diseases and their ultimate neurological&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will be patients at least 2 years old with known or suspected infection&#xD;
      or inflammation of the nervous system and family members. Subjects will be recruited through&#xD;
      referrals to the NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a longitudinal case series with standardized research data collection at predefined&#xD;
      time points. Subjects will have scheduled visits at the NIH either as an outpatient or an&#xD;
      inpatient. The core research evaluations include: a comprehensive history and neurological&#xD;
      examination; blood, urine, and saliva collection; neuroimaging; and lumbar puncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up visits will be individualized based on clinical needs and results of research&#xD;
      evaluations. For some subjects, no additional NIH visits will be necessary&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, we will also enroll subjects with known or suspected infections or inflammation&#xD;
      of the nervous system from whom only biological samples collected by outside clinicians will&#xD;
      be processed and retained for research analyses. In cases were samples remain from those&#xD;
      collected for clinical reasons and the samples are deidentified, the samples may be obtained&#xD;
      with a waiver of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study outcomes will primarily be the characterizations of varied inflammatory and&#xD;
      infectious nervous system diseases. These characterizations will include: the clinical&#xD;
      phenotype and biomarkers.&#xD;
