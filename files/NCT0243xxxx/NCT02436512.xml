      The EAGLE study is a Phase 3, open-label, multi-center, two-part, single-arm study of&#xD;
      GeNOsyl(R) delivery system(s) to evaluate if inhaled nitric oxide-induced vasodilation&#xD;
      predicts successful wean from parenteral prostacyclin (PGI) in subjects with World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) undergoing a medically&#xD;
      necessary right heart catheterization (RHC). All subjects enrolled in the study will undergo&#xD;
      an attempt to wean from parenteral PGI per standard of care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be divided into 2 parts: a Pilot Phase followed by Pivotal Phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Pilot Phase will enroll up to 20 subjects. The information derived from the Pilot&#xD;
           Phase will evaluate safety, and assess the vasoreactivity test response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Approximately 150 subjects will be enrolled in the Pivotal Phase of the study, to gather&#xD;
           further data on weaned successes from parenteral PGI. The Investigator and study staff&#xD;
           involved with the wean and patient management will be blinded in this phase of the study&#xD;
           to the vasoreactivity results.&#xD;

    <description>To evaluate the number of subjects that achieve Wean Success that are Vasoreactivity Response (VR) positive (+) versus VR negative (-)and the number of subjects that are Wean Failures that are VR(+) versus VR(-).&#xD;
Wean-Success:&#xD;
No parenteral PGI therapy at 3 months post-wean completion; and&#xD;
Clinical stability, where clinical stability is defined as:&#xD;
A decrease in 6MWT distance less than 10% from pre-wean; and&#xD;
NT-proBNP increase &lt;15% from pre-wean; and&#xD;
WHO Functional Class &lt;III&#xD;
Wean-Failure:&#xD;
Subjects that wean successfully but do not meet all clinical stability components of the Wean-Success definition above; or&#xD;
Failure to wean within the 3 month Transition Period; or&#xD;
Re-initiation of parental PGI during the 3 month post-wean or subject does not meet the definition of clinical stability at 3 month post-wean; or&#xD;
Death or hospitalization due to progression of disease; or&#xD;
Atrial septostomy; or&#xD;
Heart and/or lung transplantation</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject or subject's legally authorized representative signs and dates an&#xD;
             Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved informed consent form prior to the&#xD;
             initiation of any study-related activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has been diagnosed with PAH (WHO Group 1) and is WHO Functional Class I or&#xD;
             II at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has documented continuous PGI use for ≥ 1 year from Screening, without a&#xD;
             significant interruption (i.e., ≤ 2 day interruption) and without a failed complete&#xD;
             wean attempt.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is a candidate for weaning off parenteral PGI therapy (per Investigator&#xD;
             judgment and standard of care).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has a hypersensitivity or allergy to ingredients of inhaled nitric oxide&#xD;
             or other clinically significant allergies (clinical significance per Investigator&#xD;
             judgment).&#xD;
&#xD;
