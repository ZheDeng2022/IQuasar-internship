  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective single- center observational study in the Leiden University Medical&#xD;
      Center in approximately 250 children (&lt;12 years) undergoing elective cardiac surgery, for&#xD;
      congenital heart disease. The parents/guardians of the children will be asked to fill out a&#xD;
      questionnaire, to asses respiratory symptoms in the last weeks, before the operation of their&#xD;
      child. In the operating theatre, a nasopharyngeal swab will collected. Clinical data will be&#xD;
      collected daily during paediatric intensive care admission, and date of discharge from&#xD;
      paediatric intensive care unit and from hospital are recorded. If children are still&#xD;
      intubated at day 4 a second nasopharyngeal swab and residual blood will be collected. The&#xD;
      samples will be tested for rhinovirus with a polymerase chain reaction. Main study parameter&#xD;
      is the paediatric intensive care unit length of stay in per-operative rhinovirus -positive&#xD;
      compared to rhinovirus-negative patients.&#xD;

      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory infections are considered to carry a potential risk of adverse events in children&#xD;
      undergoing surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rhinovirus is a common cause of respiratory infections and congenital heart disease is a risk&#xD;
      factor for severe rhinovirus infection. However, we do not know what the impact of clinical&#xD;
      or subclinical rhinovirus infections is on postoperative course following congenital heart&#xD;
      surgery in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on our clinical experience, one case-controlled study , and a case reported in the&#xD;
      literature, we hypothesize that paediatric patients with per-operative rhinovirus positive&#xD;
      Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing have a longer paediatric intensive care unit (PICU)&#xD;
      admission , compared to children who test negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: To identify whether PCR-proven rhinovirus is a risk factor for prolonged PICU&#xD;
      admission in children undergoing cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: to develop a preoperative algorithm to identify children with increased risk for&#xD;
      prolonged PICU admission after cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective single-center observational cohort study in the Leiden University&#xD;
      Medical Center (LUMC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Parents of the selected patients will receive the information folder and a&#xD;
      questionnaire by mail (asking for signs and symptoms of current and/or recent respiratory&#xD;
      infections) when they receive the letter with the date of admission and operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of admission (day -1) all (parents of) children admitted for cardiac surgery will&#xD;
      be asked to participate in this study and fill out a written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At day 0, the operation day, in the operating theatre a nasopharyngeal swab will be collected&#xD;
      following anaesthetic induction and tested for rhinovirus. All clinicians will be blinded for&#xD;
      the PCR results and will only be made known to the investigator from the virology department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and laboratory data will be collected for all patients until discharge from the&#xD;
      hospital. Of all the patients still on mechanical ventilation at day 4, an additional&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal swab will be sampled and scavenge samples blood will be requested at the&#xD;
      chemical laboratory if available. Rhinovirus PCR will be performed on nasopharyngeal swab and&#xD;
      blood to determine shedding and viremia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Residual blood (for infection parameters) will be collected at three time points: after&#xD;
      induction of anaesthesia, directly after operation at PICU admission and at day four (4) when&#xD;
      the patient is still on ventilator support.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No informed consent from one of the parents (or the legal representative if&#xD;
             applicable)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anaesthesiologist or cardiopulmonary surgeon postpones surgery based on routine&#xD;
             hospital screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Emergency surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-operative admission to the neonatology department&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children not admitted to the intensive care unit after cardiac surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children undergoing a second cardiac operation during the same intensive care stay&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children with duct-dependent physiology who remain prostaglandin-dependent after the&#xD;
             heart operation (they will be excluded because they will certainly have a prolonged&#xD;
             PICU LOS regardless of a possible rhinovirus infection). For example: hypoplastic left&#xD;
             heart syndrome following pulmonary artery banding who will remain on prostaglandins&#xD;
             until the next staged operation&#xD;
