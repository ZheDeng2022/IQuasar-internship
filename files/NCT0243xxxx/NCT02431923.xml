      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Ebola is a lethal disease. A lot is still unknown about Ebola and its long-term effects.&#xD;
      Researchers want to learn what ill health conditions Ebola survivors have. They want to learn&#xD;
      if Ebola survivors can infect others in their household through close contact. They also want&#xD;
      to learn if Ebola survivors are immune from getting Ebola again. To learn these things, they&#xD;
      want to follow people in Liberia for 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To learn how Ebola affects the health of survivors and the people they live with.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People in Liberia who had Ebola in the past 2 years, who share a household with someone who&#xD;
      had Ebola, or who got ill and went to an Ebola Treatment Unit but were sent home because they&#xD;
      did not have Ebola.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with family illness history, physical exam, and blood&#xD;
           tests. They may have an eye exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ebola survivors and those who went to a Treatment Unit but did not have Ebola will visit&#xD;
           a clinic at 3, 6, and 12 months, then every 6 months for 5 years. At each visit, they&#xD;
           will repeat the screening tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who live with someone who had Ebola will have only the screening visit. But&#xD;
           they may be asked to return for follow-up visits. These visits will help researchers&#xD;
           learn more about the differences between those who have had Ebola and those who have&#xD;
           not.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants brought to the NIH Clinical Center will have documentation of positive&#xD;
           Ebola virus PCR and a clinical syndrome compatible with acute EVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will last 5 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Between 1994 and the present, there have been several Ebola virus outbreaks affecting mostly&#xD;
      countries in Central Africa. However, the 2014 West African outbreak significantly exceeds&#xD;
      all previous outbreaks in geographic range and number of individuals affected. Ebola virus&#xD;
      disease (EVD) is highly lethal with case fatality rates of 70-80% in the current West African&#xD;
      outbreak. While the clinical manifestations of acute Ebola virus infection are well&#xD;
      documented, little is known about long-term sequelae, ability to transmit Ebola, or long-term&#xD;
      protective immunity in survivors from EVD. The purpose of this protocol is to study these&#xD;
      questions in a cohort of EVD survivors from Liberia.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR EVD SURVIVORS&#xD;
&#xD;
        A volunteer of any age with a diagnosis of EVD within the past 2 years who is on the&#xD;
        Ministry of Health (MOH) Registry of EVD survivors is eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to participate in examinations at one of the participating health&#xD;
             facilities&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to provide informed consent/assent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals on the MOH Registry were PCR positive for EVD and treated at an Ebola Treatment&#xD;
        Unit (ETU), Community Care Center (CCC) or holding center. Periodically, participants&#xD;
        enrolled will be matched against the MOH Registry to verify that those enrolled are EVD&#xD;
        survivors. If a participant enrolled is not on the registry, their antibody levels at&#xD;
        baseline will be assessed. If antibody levels are present, the participant will continue to&#xD;
        be followed as an EVD survivor. If antibody levels are not present, the participants will&#xD;
        no longer be followed as an EVD survivor and may be withdrawn from the study. Participants&#xD;
        brought to the NIH Clinical Center will have documentation of positive Ebola virus PCR and&#xD;
        a clinical syndrome compatible with acute EVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERION FOR EVD SURVIVORS&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any condition in the judgment of the study staff that would make the volunteer unable to&#xD;
        participate in the study.&#xD;
