  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infection with dengue viruses is the leading cause of hospitalization and death in children&#xD;
      in many tropical Asian countries, and the development of a dengue vaccine is a top health&#xD;
      priority. This study will evaluate the ability of a single dose of a trivalent dengue vaccine&#xD;
      to protect against infection with an attenuated candidate DENV-2 vaccine, administered 6&#xD;
      months after the trivalent dengue vaccine.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are 4 types of dengue virus (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4), each capable of&#xD;
      causing dengue illness ranging from a mild illness to life-threatening disease. This study&#xD;
      will evaluate a trivalent live attenuated dengue admixture vaccine that contains 3 different&#xD;
      monovalent dengue vaccine candidates, representing 3 of the 4 dengue serotypes (DENV-1,&#xD;
      DENV-3, and DENV-4). Study researchers will evaluate the safety and protective efficacy of a&#xD;
      single dose of the trivalent dengue vaccine against viremia and rash induced by infection&#xD;
      with an attenuated DENV-2 virus (rDEN2Δ30-7169), administered 6 months after the trivalent&#xD;
      dengue vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll healthy adults with no history of previous flavivirus infection. At&#xD;
      Day 0 (study entry), participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the trivalent&#xD;
      dengue vaccine admixture or placebo. On Day 180, all participants will receive the&#xD;
      rDEN2Δ30-7169 vaccine. Study visits will occur on Days 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 21, 28, 56,&#xD;
      90, 150, 180, 184, 186, 188, 190, 192, 194, 196, 201, 208, 236, 270, and 360. Visits will&#xD;
      include physical examinations and blood collection. All participants will record their&#xD;
      temperature 3 times a day for 16 days after each vaccination.&#xD;
