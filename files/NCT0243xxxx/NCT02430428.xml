      The objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Carl&#xD;
      Zeiss Meditec VisuMax™ Femtosecond Laser lenticule removal procedure for the reduction or&#xD;
      elimination of myopia from ≥ -1.00 D to ≤ -10.00 D with ≤ -3.00 D cylinder (myopia with or&#xD;
      without astigmatism) and MRSE ≤ -11.50 D.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective multi-center clinical trial in which a maximum of 360 eyes of 360&#xD;
      consecutive subjects will be enrolled and treated with the VisuMax™ Femtosecond Laser. The&#xD;
      study will be conducted at up to 8 clinical sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be screened for eligibility, and informed consent will be obtained from those&#xD;
      who meet screening criteria and are interested in participating in the study. Eligible&#xD;
      subjects will be examined preoperatively to obtain a medical history and to establish a&#xD;
      baseline ocular condition. Baseline and postoperative measurements will include manifest&#xD;
      refraction, cycloplegic refraction, distance visual acuity (best corrected and uncorrected),&#xD;
      slit-lamp examination, fundus examination, corneal topography, central corneal pachymetry,&#xD;
      mesopic pupil measurement, wavefront analysis, mesopic contrast sensitivity, and intraocular&#xD;
      pressure (IOP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only eyes with astigmatism ≥ -0.75 D to ≤ -3.00 D targeted for the full distance manifest&#xD;
      spherocylindrical refraction, or eye(s) with astigmatism &lt; -0.75 D targeted for the full&#xD;
      distance manifest sphere-only refraction, will be enrolled into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects must have astigmatism ≤ -3.00 D in the eye to be treated. Eyes with astigmatism ≥&#xD;
      -0.75 D to ≤ -3.00 D will receive a spherocylindrical treatment. Eyes with astigmatism &lt;&#xD;
      -0.75 D will receive a sphere-only treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operative eyes with astigmatism ≥ -0.75 D to ≤ -3.00 D must be targeted for the full distance&#xD;
      manifest spherocylindrical refraction. Operative eye(s) with astigmatism &lt; -0.75 D must be&#xD;
      targeted for the full distance manifest sphere-only refraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monovision treatments and retreatments of the study eye will not be allowed during the course&#xD;
      of the study. Bilateral investigational treatments will not be allowed during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and effectiveness criteria from the American National Standard for Ophthalmics (ANSI&#xD;
      Z80.11-2012) - Laser Systems for Corneal Reshaping will be utilized in the evaluation of the&#xD;
      VisuMax Femtosecond Laser.&#xD;
