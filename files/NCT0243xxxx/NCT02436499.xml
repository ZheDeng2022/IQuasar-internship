      Pilot study evaluating effect of Botox injection treatment for 12 individuals suffering from&#xD;
      chronic migraine on function MRI imaging, before and after treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A proposed 12 patients will be recruited for participation in the pilot study. Consenting&#xD;
      patients between the ages of 18-65 years old with confirmed chronic migraine (as defined by&#xD;
      International Headache Society criteria) and meeting all other inclusion criteria (to be&#xD;
      described in full protocol) will be enrolled for participation in the trial. Participants&#xD;
      currently receiving migraine prophylaxis will be tapered off the specified medication&#xD;
      (tapering regimen to be determined by clinicians) and a 4-week washout period will be&#xD;
      observed prior to baseline assessments and Botox treatment. These patients will be permitted&#xD;
      to use acute migraine medications as required. Participants will undergo baseline migraine&#xD;
      significance assessments, which will include Headache Impact Test (HIT-6), the Migraine&#xD;
      Disability Assessment (MIDAS) questionnaire and the Migraine Impact Questionnaire. Baseline&#xD;
      neurological assessment will also be conducted at this visit. Additionally, baseline Beck&#xD;
      Depression and Anxiety Inventories will be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also undergo baseline fMRI on the 3Tesla Siemens MRI magnet at the National&#xD;
      Research Council (NRC) Building located at 435 Ellice Avenue in Winnipeg, Manitoba. At this&#xD;
      time, both structural and resting state fMRI data will be acquired. A 72-hour minimum&#xD;
      migraine-free period will be ensured before each individual is allowed to proceed with&#xD;
      imaging. A localizer image will be obtained. This is used for determining the participant's&#xD;
      head position and for setting up the field of view for all subsequent images. Next, a&#xD;
      high-resolution 3-dimensional image will be taken of the whole brain. This will be acquired&#xD;
      with the following imaging parameters [Siemens MP-RAGE sequence, 1mm thick slices, zero&#xD;
      spacing between slices, repetition time of 1900 ms, echo time of 2.2 ms, in plane resolution&#xD;
      of 0.94 x 0.94, 256 x 256 matrix size with a 24 cm field of view, 176 volumes, resulting in a&#xD;
      8 minute 6 second scan time]. After the high-resolution image has been acquired, the resting&#xD;
      state fMRI data will be acquired with the following parameters [Siemens echo planar imaging&#xD;
      (EPI) sequence, 3 mm thick slices, zero spacing between slices, repetition time of 3000 ms,&#xD;
      echo time of 30 ms, flip angle of 90Â°, 64 x 64 matrix size, 24 cm field of view, 140 volumes,&#xD;
      resulting in a 7 minute 9 second scan time]. This provides the data set for the functional&#xD;
      connectivity analysis. The high-resolution anatomical data serves as the background for the&#xD;
      display of the superimposed resting state fMRI data. All image data will be acquired with an&#xD;
      alpha-numeric code representing the study protocol number and participant number; the data&#xD;
      will be transferred to a flash drive and copied to the principal investigator's hard drive&#xD;
      for analysis. All participant paperwork and data back-up will be securely stored in the&#xD;
      principal investigator's locked filing cabinet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following baseline screening, participants will receive two subsequent treatments with&#xD;
      botulinum-A toxin, each separated by 12 weeks. Participants will receive standardized&#xD;
      botulinum-A toxin dosing for chronic migraine prophylaxis, comprised of 155 total units given&#xD;
      at 31 specified sites across 7 head/neck muscles (protocol to be explicitly described in full&#xD;
      protocol). Second dose of botulinum-A toxin will either be maintained at 155 total units as&#xD;
      dosed initially, or be increased to 195 total units, depending on response to clinical&#xD;
      questionnaires and examination to evaluate response and efficacy (to be described in full&#xD;
      protocol, consistent with the &quot;Follow-the-Pain Injection Paradigm&quot;). Following initial&#xD;
      treatment (Day=0) participants will be requested to maintain daily headache diaries, in which&#xD;
      they will be asked to record symptoms of active migraine as well as the use of acute migraine&#xD;
      medications on a daily basis, in order to track migraine frequency and severity (example of&#xD;
      headache diary will be included in full protocol). Participant timeline will be as follows:&#xD;
      Day 0 (baseline assessments, fMRI and first Botox injection), Day 28 (clinic follow-up), Day&#xD;
      56 (second fMRI), Day 84 (clinic follow-up and second injection), Day 112 (clinic follow-up)&#xD;
      and Day 140 (third fMRI). Clinic follow-up will be scheduled for Days 28, 84 and 112 at which&#xD;
      time adverse events will be reviewed, as well as headache frequency reported in daily&#xD;
      headache diaries. At these time points, participants will also repeat the same assessments&#xD;
      completed at the baseline visit, including the HIT-6, MIDAS and Migraine Impact&#xD;
      Questionnaire. At study termination (Day=140) patients will undergo a final fMRI scan as per&#xD;
      baseline MRI protocol previously described.&#xD;
