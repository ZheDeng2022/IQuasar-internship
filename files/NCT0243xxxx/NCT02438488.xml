    <textblock>
      Vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for mortality but existing data are limited by missing&#xD;
      standardization of laboratory methods for 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D). In a European&#xD;
      consortium of eight cohort studies we use protocols of the Vitamin D Standardization Program&#xD;
      (VDSP) to obtain standardized 25(OH)D data. Individual participant data (IPD) meta-analyses&#xD;
      using a one step procedure will be performed to study associations of original and&#xD;
      standardized 25(OH)D with all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Vitamin D is involved in the regulation of calcium homeostasis and exerts beneficial effects&#xD;
      on skeletal health. Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) are measured to assess&#xD;
      vitamin D status, which is mainly determined by sunlight (ultraviolet-B) induced vitamin D&#xD;
      production in the skin and, to a lesser extent, by dietary or supplemental vitamin D intake.&#xD;
      A poor vitamin D status has emerged as a risk factor for various adverse health outcomes&#xD;
      including mortality, but there exists controversy on the classification of vitamin D status&#xD;
      and the shape of the association between 25(OH)D concentrations and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Existing knowledge on vitamin D status and mortality is limited by missing standardization of&#xD;
      laboratory methods. Previous studies have shown that assay and laboratory differences have a&#xD;
      significant impact on the reported 25(OH)D concentrations and thus on the association between&#xD;
      25(OH)D and health outcomes. Therefore, the Vitamin D Standardization Program (VDSP), a&#xD;
      collaborative initiative led by the National Institutes of Health-Office of Dietary&#xD;
      Supplements (NIH-ODS), has developed protocols for standardizing 25(OH)D data from current&#xD;
      and previous surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this work, which is part of the EU-project 'Food-based solutions for eradication of&#xD;
      vitamin D deficiency and health promotion throughout the life cycle' (ODIN), we aim to&#xD;
      address the knowledge gap on the association between standardized 25(OH)D concentrations and&#xD;
      mortality in a collaborative meta-analysis using individual participant data (IPD) from eight&#xD;
      study cohorts across Europe. In detail, we will study associations of 25(OH)D with all-cause,&#xD;
      cardiovascular, and cancer mortality. We use a one step approach for this meta-analysis,&#xD;
      which has the advantage that IPD from all studies are modelled simultaneously whereas&#xD;
      conventional two step approaches are based on aggregate data of each individual study.&#xD;
      Considering that the majority of the individual studies of this meta-analysis have already&#xD;
      reported on original 25(OH)D data we aim to compare original and standardized 25(OH)D&#xD;
      concentrations regarding differences in reported concentrations and their associations with&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods STUDY IDENTIFICATION &amp; SELECTION We established a collaboration to undertake this&#xD;
      meta-analysis of IPD. Potential participants in a work-package of the EU Seventh Framework&#xD;
      programme ODIN were invited to attend a one-day workshop in Amsterdam in November 2012 to&#xD;
      discuss aims, implementation and development of the task. Invited European-based participants&#xD;
      were identified on the basis of having recently published data from large prospective cohorts&#xD;
      of vitamin D with mortality and cardiovascular outcomes. There were a number of prerequisites&#xD;
      for inclusion of individual cohort studies in ODIN: It was necessary to have quality&#xD;
      bio-banked samples for uniform sampling and analysis of selected samples, validated&#xD;
      prospective data on clinical outcomes, willingness to collaborate and expertise in the field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDIES &amp; PARTICIPANTS All individual cohorts are part of the ODIN Consortium. We will use&#xD;
      IPD from eight independent prospective cohort studies from Norway, Germany, Denmark, the&#xD;
      Netherlands and Iceland. Included studies are the 4th survey of the Tromsø study, the&#xD;
      Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular Health Study (LURIC), the Age, Gene/Environment&#xD;
      Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study (AGES), the New Hoorn Study (NHS), the Aarhus Mammography&#xD;
      Cohort Study, the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Adults (DEGS) and the&#xD;
      old and young cohort of the Longitudinal Study on Ageing in Amsterdam (LASA). All cohort&#xD;
      studies were conducted in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki and written informed&#xD;
      consent was obtained from all study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEASUREMENT OF 25(OH)D According to the VDSP protocol we will conduct a sampling procedure to&#xD;
      select a subset of 100-150 bio-banked serum samples from each individual cohort study for&#xD;
      re-analysis of 25(OH)D by a standardized and certified liquid chromatography-tandem mass&#xD;
      spectrometry (LC-tandem MS) method, which is traceable to the United States National&#xD;
      Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) higher order Reference Measurement Procedure.&#xD;
      The re-analysed 25(OH)D values will be used to develop master regression equations for every&#xD;
      present cohort study and to re-calibrate existing 25(OH)D measurements. The NHS has no&#xD;
      previous 25(OH)D measurements and will be analysed in full.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUPING The IPD population will be divided into seven groups according to their 25(OH)D&#xD;
      status at baseline. The allocation of individuals into one of the seven subgroups will be&#xD;
      performed for original and standardized 25(OH)D measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the Institute of Medicine (IOM) report 2011, thresholds for 25(OH)D groups will&#xD;
      be assigned as severely vitamin D deficient (≤29•99 nmol/L), as two groups of patients at&#xD;
      risk for inadequacy (from 30 to ≤ 39•99 nmol/L and 40 to ≤ 49•99 nmol/L), as vitamin D&#xD;
      sufficient (from 50 to ≤ 75 nmol/L), as two groups of vitamin D levels which are not&#xD;
      consistently associated with increased benefit (from 75 to ≤ 99•99 nmol/L; from 100 to ≤&#xD;
      124•99 nmol/L) and as high vitamin D levels with reason for concern (≥ 125 nmol/L; to convert&#xD;
      nmol/L to ng/mL divide by 2•496).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Differences between original and standardized 25(OH)D concentrations&#xD;
      will be assessed by a paired-sample t-test. For comparisons of other baseline characteristics&#xD;
      across baseline standardized vitamin D groups, we will use ANOVA for continuous and χ2 test&#xD;
      for categorical data, as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All-cause mortality is the primary outcome and is available in all participating cohort&#xD;
      studies. Secondary outcomes are cardiovascular mortality and cancer mortality and are&#xD;
      available in all cohort studies except of the NHS. All endpoints were sought in the greatest&#xD;
      detail available from death certificates, municipal registries, medical records and local&#xD;
      authorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All outcome analyses will be performed for original and standardized 25(OH)D values by means&#xD;
      of IPD meta-analysis estimates and study-specific estimates. The analyses will be based on&#xD;
      individuals with complete data on age, sex, body mass index (BMI), season of blood sampling,&#xD;
      25(OH)D levels, vital status at follow-up and follow-up-time. Follow-up time has to be &gt; 0&#xD;
      days. Participants with missing data will be excluded from the analysis and we will perform&#xD;
      no data imputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Associations between 25(OH)D levels and all-cause mortality will be estimated using IPD in an&#xD;
      one-step approach. In general, IPD meta-analyses following a one-step procedure were shown to&#xD;
      be the more concise approach for binary outcomes compared to the frequently used two-step&#xD;
      approach, were aggregated data is analysed. We will use a hierarchical, parametric survival&#xD;
      model, which is more feasible compared to a Cox model when analysing binary outcomes. The&#xD;
      single equation will be processed in a parametric, accelerated failure time (AFT) Weibull&#xD;
      model, which appeared to fit best the underlying data against exponential, log-logistic and&#xD;
      log-normal distributions. The model will be built using SAS PROC NLMIXED (SAS Institute Inc.,&#xD;
      100 SAS Campus Drive, Cary, USA) and random intercept to account for random effects across&#xD;
      cohort studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the mortality analyses, 25(OH)D will be modelled using 1) a traditional categorical&#xD;
      variable approach with groups according to the prior mentioned IOM classification, and 2) a&#xD;
      restricted cubic splines approach. The cubic-splines approach was chosen to retain the&#xD;
      continuous nature of 25(OH)D values and to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals (CI) at the mean value of each group. We chose the 25(OH)D group with the lowest&#xD;
      mortality risk as the reference. Our outcome analyses will be cumulatively adjusted for risk&#xD;
      factors of mortality and determinants of vitamin D status. In model 1 we adjust for age (in&#xD;
      years), sex (male/female), and season of blood collection (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter).&#xD;
      In model 2, our main statistical model, we additionally adjust for BMI (in kg/m²). In model&#xD;
      3, we additionally adjust for diabetes mellitus (yes/no) and arterial hypertension (yes/no),&#xD;
      and in model 4 we add history of cancer (yes/no), history of cardiovascular disease (yes/no)&#xD;
      and current smoking status as covariates (yes/no).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional adjustments have model two as reference model. Additional adjusting covariates are&#xD;
      not available in every cohort study, so additional adjustments will only be performed in the&#xD;
      studies that can provide those covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, supplemental intake of calcium (yes/no) will be added to model two. The first&#xD;
      additional adjustment analysis wil be performed in all studies, but DEGS and LASA, young&#xD;
      cohort, as no information on supplemental usage is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, supplemental intake of vitamin D (yes/no) will be added to model two in all studies&#xD;
      but LASA, old and young cohort, and DEGS, as no information on supplemental usage of vitamin&#xD;
      D is available in these studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third, additional adjustment of model two for physical activity (three dummy variables for&#xD;
      low, medium and high frequency of physical activity) will be processed in all studies but the&#xD;
      Aarhus mammography cohort. For sensitivity analysis, we will also leave out DEGS, as the&#xD;
      participants in DEGS have a high proportion of young, physically active individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fourth, adjustment for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; in mL/min/1•73m²) will be&#xD;
      added to model two. The eGFR will be calculated from creatinine at baseline visit according&#xD;
      to the four-variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation and will be&#xD;
      added to model two in all studies but NHS, as no creatinine measurements are available in&#xD;
      NHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a fifth analysis, adjustment for parathyroid hormone (in pmol/L) will be added to model&#xD;
      two in all studies but NHS, Aarhus mammography cohort and LASA, young cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a sixth analysis, adjustment for C-reactive protein (in mg/L) will be added to model two&#xD;
      in all studies but NHS, Aarhus mammography cohort and LASA, young cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a seventh analysis, adjustment for systolic blood pressure (in mm Hg) will be added to&#xD;
      model two in all studies but the Aarhus mammography cohort, and DEGS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an eighth analysis, adjustment for low density lipoprotein cholesterol (in mmol/L) will be&#xD;
      added to model two in all studies but the Aarhus mammography cohort, and DEGS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a ninth analysis, adjustment for glucose (in mmol/L) will be added to model two in all&#xD;
      studies but the Tromsø Study, Aarhus mammography cohort, and DEGS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All models on original 25(OH)D will be performed without NHS, as NHS had no original 25(OH)D&#xD;
      measurements. For standardized 25(OH)D, we will compute all models 1) with data of NHS and 2)&#xD;
      without data from NHS to provide comparable results between models of original and&#xD;
      standardized 25(OH)D measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity Analyses Subgroup analyses will be performed to stratify for risk factors for&#xD;
      vitamin D deficiency and mortality. In detail we stratified for sex (females/males), age&#xD;
      groups (&lt;60 years; 60 to 69•9 years; 70+ years), BMI groups (&lt;25 kg/m²; 25&lt;30 kg/m²; ≥30&#xD;
      kg/m²), calcium supplementation (yes/no), vitamin D supplementation (yes/no), history of CVD&#xD;
      (yes/no), and history of cancer (yes/no). A further sensitivity analysis will be restricted&#xD;
      to individuals that died &gt; 1 year and &gt; 3 years after baseline examination and restricted to&#xD;
      general population cohorts (i.e. all cohorts except LURIC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes To assess secondary outcomes of cardiovascular and cancer mortality, we&#xD;
      utilize traditional Cox proportional hazards and the modified risks regression according to&#xD;
      the method of Fine and Gray to account for competing risks. In brief, proportional hazards&#xD;
      may not be satisfied in multi-centre settings, so baseline hazards are allowed to vary across&#xD;
      single cohort studies.&#xD;
