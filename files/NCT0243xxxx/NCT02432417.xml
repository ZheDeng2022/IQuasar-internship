  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastomas (GBM) are the most common type of primary brain tumors with an annual incidence&#xD;
      of approximately 500 patients in the Netherlands. Despite extensive treatment including a&#xD;
      resection, radiation therapy and chemotherapy, the median overall survival is only 14.6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) amplification or mutation is regularly observed in&#xD;
      GBM and is thought to be a major contributor to resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy.&#xD;
      The most common EGFR mutation in GBM (EGFRvIII) is present in 30-50% of GBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously MAASTRO lab has shown that expression of EGFRvIII provides GBM cells with a&#xD;
      survival advantage when exposed to stress factors such as hypoxia and nutrient deprivation.&#xD;
      These metabolic stress factors activate a lysosomal degradation pathway, known as autophagy.&#xD;
      Inhibition of autophagy sensitizes cells to hypoxia, reduces the viable hypoxic fraction in&#xD;
      tumors with &gt; 40% and subsequently sensitizes these tumors to irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chloroquine (CQ) is a potent autophagy blocker and is the most widely investigated substance&#xD;
      in this context. Previously, the effect of CQ has been demonstrated in a small randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial in GBM treated with radiotherapy and carmustine. Although not statistically&#xD;
      significantly different, the rate of death over time was approximately half as large in&#xD;
      patients receiving CQ as in patients receiving placebo. The intracellular effects of CQ are&#xD;
      dose-dependent. Therefore, the authors suggest an increase in daily dose of CQ may be&#xD;
      necessary. Furthermore, the combination of CQ with TMZ may induce more damage to the&#xD;
      neoplastic cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase I part of this trial the recommended dose of CQ in combination with radiotherapy&#xD;
      and temozolomide will be tested. In the phase II part of the trial patients with a&#xD;
      histologically confirmed GBM will be randomized between standard treatment consisting of&#xD;
      concurrent radiotherapy with temozolomide and adjuvant temozolomide (arm A) and standard&#xD;
      treatment plus CQ (arm B).&#xD;

      This study is a multi-centre randomized controlled, open label, phase II trial for patients&#xD;
      with de-novo GBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomized between arm A and arm B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A (standard): Radiotherapy and chemotherapy according to standard protocol for newly&#xD;
      diagnosed GBM. This consists of 30 daily fractions of 2 Gy or 33 fractions in 1.8 Gy to the&#xD;
      tumor and surrounding margin in combination with temozolomide 75 mg/m² per os daily (po qd)&#xD;
      and six adjuvant cycles of temozolomide 150 - 200 mg/m² po qd.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B (experimental): Standard treatment as described under arm A combined with daily intake&#xD;
      of 400mg CQ. CQ will start with one week before the start of radiotherapy and end on the last&#xD;
      day of radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a single centre exploratory substudy, thirty subjects sequentially recruited within&#xD;
      MAASTRO clinic randomized to arm B will be invited to receive two 3-[18F]fluoro-&#xD;
      2-(4-((2-nitro-1H-imidazol-1-yl)methyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1- yl)propan-1-ol PET-scans&#xD;
      ([18F]HX4 ). The first on day -6 (start CQ), the second on day 0 (before the start&#xD;
      radiotherapy and TMZ).&#xD;
