  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center randomized trial with three arms, and an allocation&#xD;
      ratio of 1:1:1. The study design is an efficacy study to evaluate the effect of metformin and&#xD;
      coach-directed behavioral weight loss versus self-directed weight loss on insulin-like growth&#xD;
      factor (IGF)-1 and IGF-1 to THE IGFBP-III ratio blood levels after 6 and 12 months of&#xD;
      intervention. The coach-directed Behavioral Weight Loss arm is a web-based remote delivery&#xD;
      and communication system that promotes healthy behavioral changes. The Metformin arm is a&#xD;
      pharmaceutical intervention of oral metformin. This is a secondary prevention study for men&#xD;
      and women who have survived solid malignant tumors&#xD;
