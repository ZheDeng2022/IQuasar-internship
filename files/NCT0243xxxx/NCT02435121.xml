      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine objective response rate (ORR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess duration of response (DR), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival&#xD;
      (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate global safety profile. To determine pharmacokinetic profile. To assess clinical&#xD;
      utility of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay in selection of patients with&#xD;
      mesenchymal-epithelial hybridization (MET) gene amplification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess lung cancer symptoms, health-related quality of life and treatment satisfaction.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The duration of the study for 1 patient will include a screening period of up to 3 weeks, a&#xD;
      3-week treatment cycle(s) and a follow-up period. The patients will be treated for 6 cycles&#xD;
      in case no response is observed, and treatment may be continued beyond 6 cycles in case of&#xD;
      partial response/complete response (PR/CR) or significant clinical benefit until progressive&#xD;
      disease, unacceptable toxicity, willingness to stop the study treatment or until study&#xD;
      termination by sponsor. After the completion of the study treatment each patient will be&#xD;
      followed every 6 weeks until death or the study cut-off date, whichever comes first. For&#xD;
      patients who went-off study treatment prior disease progression is documented, date of&#xD;
      disease progression and further anticancer treatment will be collected in follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cut-off date corresponds to the date at which all the treated patients will have 3&#xD;
      post-baseline tumor assessments or will early discontinue whatever the reason. Beyond cut-off&#xD;
      date, patient can continue study treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity&#xD;
      or patient's refusal, provided clinical benefit is established.&#xD;
