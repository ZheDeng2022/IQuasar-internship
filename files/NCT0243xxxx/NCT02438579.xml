  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Viral upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), one of the commonest infection faced by&#xD;
      humans, have a significant impact on individuals, families, health service and economy.&#xD;
      Though rhinoviruses are called the &quot;common cold virus&quot;, numerous viruses can cause URTI.&#xD;
      Hence virus specific remedy for URTI is impractical. There are currently no evidence-based&#xD;
      interventions that reduce the severity, symptom duration or viral shedding. Preliminary&#xD;
      evidence suggests that hypertonic saline nasal irrigation and gargling (HSNIG) may reduce the&#xD;
      duration of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT), the investigators aim to assess the&#xD;
      feasibility of undertaking a definitive RCT of HSNIG in adults with URTI. This pilot focuses&#xD;
      on recruitment rate, willingness to be randomised, acceptability, compliance and likely&#xD;
      effect size of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot RCT compares HSNIG vs. usual care in 60 adults. Serial self-collected&#xD;
      mid-turbinate swabs will help assess change in viral shedding. Symptomatic relief is measured&#xD;
      by a validated symptom score. A questionnaire based participant feedback will help assess&#xD;
      intervention and trial procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This mixed-methods pilot trial will help inform plans for a definitive RCT of this low-cost&#xD;
      intervention that has the potential of substantial health and societal benefits.&#xD;

      1. Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
           To assess the feasibility of undertaking a RCT of HSNIG in adults with URTI focusing on&#xD;
           recruitment rate, willingness to be randomised, acceptability, compliance and likely&#xD;
           effect size of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1. Research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. What is the likely rate of recruitment and loss to follow-up?&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Are the study procedures acceptable to participants?&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Is there a likely reduction in duration of symptoms and viral shedding?&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. What effect size is estimated for the definitive trial in relation to duration of&#xD;
                symptoms and improvement in quality-of-life?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1 Sample size: This is a pilot trial so no formal sample size calculations are&#xD;
           indicated. However, with a sample size of 27 per group the investigators would be able&#xD;
           to express the proportion of those who return the symptom score diary and samples within&#xD;
           that group to within ±19% based on a two-sided 95% confidence interval around an&#xD;
           expected proportion of 0.5. With the two groups combined [i.e. a sample size of 54] the&#xD;
           investigators would be able to express a proportion to within ±13%. To allow for 10%&#xD;
           dropouts the sample size has been increased to 30 per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2 Recruitment: The investigators propose to enrol a total of 60 participants (30/arm)&#xD;
           for this pilot. The investigators plan to recruit by advertising the study in the&#xD;
           community by the following routes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sending flyers to parents through schools run by Edinburgh and Midlothian councils.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Study website (www.elvisstudy.com), National Health Service (NHS) Lothian,&#xD;
                University of Edinburgh websites.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Local media coverage by way of interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Flyers in workplaces with large numbers of staff (e.g. banks, supermarkets,&#xD;
                councils).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Posters in pharmacies and General practitioner (GP) surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Interested individuals will be asked to contact the trial nurse at the clinical research&#xD;
           facility (CRF) situated at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh (RIE) and Western General&#xD;
           Hospital within 48 hours of symptom onset. The trial nurse will consent, randomise, and&#xD;
           recruit volunteers. Participants will be advised to go to their GP as per norm if they&#xD;
           become unwell and that they can withdraw from the study if they so wish for other&#xD;
           reasons. At the end of their participation in the study, they will be given £30 as&#xD;
           recompense for any inconvenience.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Research Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.1 Randomisation: Participants are randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive intervention or&#xD;
           control, this has been done using an online randomisation minimised by sex (M/F) and&#xD;
           smoking status (current/not a current smoker) and allocated to each treatment arm with a&#xD;
           probability 0.9 to ensure a random allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2 Instructions to participants: 3.2.1 Both arms: Participants are taught to complete&#xD;
           (online or paper) a modified short Wisconsin upper respiratory symptom survey&#xD;
           (WURSS-21-Scot) and the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. Baseline symptom scores are recorded by&#xD;
           the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants are taught to collect nasal swabs. A baseline swab is collected under&#xD;
           observation and sent to the virology laboratory at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh&#xD;
           (RIE). Swabs, transport medium and Royal Mail Safebox will be provided to the&#xD;
           participant to collect a nasal swab first thing in the morning (before HSNIG for the&#xD;
           intervention arm) for four consecutive days and return to the laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2.2 Intervention arm: The intervention group will be shown a video on preparing the&#xD;
           hypertonic sea-salt solution and how to perform HSNIG. They will be asked to perform the&#xD;
           procedure under supervision. The trial nurse will help them identify the highest&#xD;
           concentration of saline they are comfortable with. Participants are advised to perform&#xD;
           the intervention as frequently as required (expected frequency around 6 times/day for&#xD;
           the first two days, reducing in frequency from day 3 as symptoms improve). A package&#xD;
           containing instructions, digital-measuring spoon, sea-salt, and equipment for irrigation&#xD;
           and flask (if they wish to prepare solution for multiple uses during the day) will then&#xD;
           be handed over to the participant. Participants in the intervention arm will also&#xD;
           document compliance and side effects daily&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2.3 Control arm: They are advised to manage the URTI as they normally do.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.3 Data collection: 3.3.1 &quot;WURSS-21-Scot&quot; diary and EQ-5D-5L Questionnaire: All&#xD;
           participants will complete the &quot;WURSS-21-Scot&quot; diary at a set time during the day.&#xD;
           Participants will answer the question &quot;how unwell do you feel today&quot;. If they score &gt;0,&#xD;
           then symptoms and functional ability are graded 0-7. They then answer the global change&#xD;
           question. Total score/day is calculated by summing the scores of all 10 symptoms daily.&#xD;
           All participants will also answer the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following information is collected at recruitment: where they heard about the study,&#xD;
           influenza vaccination history, number of family members and whether sufficient&#xD;
           information was provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The intervention arm will also answer the following questions daily: how many times they&#xD;
           performed HSNIG, if they performed one or both parts of HSNIG and if there were any side&#xD;
           effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Both arms will answer if they had to take any medications for the URTI and whether they&#xD;
           needed to contact the GP for further management of their URTI.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Diaries are maintained until participant records &quot;not unwell&quot; on two consecutive days or&#xD;
           for a maximum of 14 days or until follow up is terminated because the individual needs&#xD;
           further treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.3.2 Virology: Swabs will be sent to the Department of Virology, RIE for testing.&#xD;
           Baseline samples will be tested to identify individuals in whom an aetiology can be&#xD;
           proven. If a viral aetiology is identified, all samples (day 0 - day 4) will be tested&#xD;
           in parallel to identify change in viral shedding.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.3.3 Data collection procedures: The trial nurse will follow up participants who do not&#xD;
           complete the diary or return samples (after 48 hours of expected return). Information on&#xD;
           number of family members with URTI will be collected at the end of the study. Feedback&#xD;
           will be collected from participants after the follow-up period. These will address&#xD;
           acceptability, health service use, costs to the patient and suggestions for improving&#xD;
           the study procedures for the main trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of participants returning swabs, completing diaries and following treatment as per&#xD;
      protocol will be presented as percentages (with 95% confidence intervals). The investigators&#xD;
      will present recruitment as an overall rate, but also graphically as there is likely to be&#xD;
      seasonal variation. Using results from the swabs the investigators will determine when a&#xD;
      person stops viral shedding and, using chi-square and chi-square test for trend, determine if&#xD;
      there is a relationship between groups. Using two-sample t-tests or non-parametric equivalent&#xD;
      as appropriate the investigators will determine if there is any evidence of a difference in&#xD;
      the duration of symptoms and symptom severity [as defined by the maximum WURSS-21-Scot score&#xD;
      over treatment period]. Feedback will be analysed using a conventional content analysis&#xD;
      approach, with emerging findings discussed by the research team to aid interpretation of&#xD;
      findings.&#xD;

    <measure>Is there a difference between arms in the duration of symptoms or viral shedding?</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of symptoms will be defined by WURSS-21-Scot [time to reach a score of 0 for two consecutive days]. If appropriate to treat as a continuous variable, a two-sample t-test or non-parametric equivalent will be used as appropriate. However it may be more appropriate to treat the time a categorical measure, if this is the case we will use Chi-square/Chi-square test for trend as appropriate. In addition to this the average WURSS-21-Scot will be compared between treatment arms using the same methods.&#xD;
Chi-square test and chi-square test for trend will be used as appropriate to determine if there is a difference in viral shedding between arms. Viral load is measured daily for the first 4 days and reported using CT values, we will estimate the slope of the line for each participant and a comparison will be made between groups. In addition to this average CT value and average log copies above level of detection will be compared across groups using a two-sample t-test.</description>
