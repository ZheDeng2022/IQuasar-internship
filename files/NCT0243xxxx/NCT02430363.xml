    <textblock>
      It is known that after application of MK-3475 activated PD -1 negatively regulates the&#xD;
      activation of T cells through suppression of the path of PI3K / Akt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will identify the effectiveness of oral inhibitors of PI3K / Akt pathway in&#xD;
      comparison with MK-3475 (pembrolizumab).&#xD;

      A humanized monoclonal IgG4 antibody directed against human cell surface receptor PD-1&#xD;
      (programmed death-1 or programmed cell death-1) with potential immunopotentiating activity.&#xD;
      Upon administration, pembrolizumab binds to PD-1, an inhibitory signaling receptor expressed&#xD;
      on the surface of activated T cells, and blocks the binding to and activation of PD-1 by its&#xD;
      ligands, which results in the activation of T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor&#xD;
      cells. The ligands for PD-1 include PD-L1, which is expressed on antigen presenting cells&#xD;
      (APCs) and overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and PD-L2, which is primarily expressed on&#xD;
      APCs. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation through the suppression of the&#xD;
      PI3K/Akt pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will identify the effectiveness of oral inhibitors of PI3K / Akt pathway in&#xD;
      comparison with MK-3475 (pembrolizumab).&#xD;
