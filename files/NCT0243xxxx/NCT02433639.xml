    <textblock>
      Biliary tract cancer is relatively rare cancer, with generally poor prognosis. In&#xD;
      metastatic/recurrent biliary tract cancer, the most commonly used 1st-line chemotherapy is&#xD;
      gemcitabine+cisplatin combination. However, there is no standard 2nd-line chemotherapy and&#xD;
      there is no validated targeted therapeutic agent, even though this tumor harbors diverse&#xD;
      genetic characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TH-302 (1-methyl-2-nitro-1H-imidazole-5-yl)methyl N,N'-bis(2-bromoethyl) diamidophos-phate is&#xD;
      a nitroimidazole-linked prodrug of a brominated version of isophosphoramide mustard (Br-IPM).&#xD;
      When exposed to hypoxic conditions, TH-302 is reduced at the nitroimadazole site of the&#xD;
      prodrug by intracellular reductases leading to the release of Br-IPM. Br-IPM can then act as&#xD;
      a DNA crosslinking agent. In areas of normoxia, TH-302 remains intact as a prodrug and&#xD;
      toxicity is minimized. In addition, preclinical data suggest that after activation, the&#xD;
      active moiety may diffuse to areas outside the hypoxic region, demonstrating a &quot;bystander&quot;&#xD;
      effect and possibly exhibiting additional anti-tumor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well known that biliary tract cancer is hypovascular tumor, so it contains large&#xD;
      hypoxic area in the tumor. Therefore it would be worthy to test TH-302 in biliary tract&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a phase II study of TH-302 monotherapy as second-line treatment in advanced&#xD;
      biliary tract cancer, to investigate efficacy and safety of TH-302 monotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Biliary tract cancer is relatively rare disease worldwide among all kinds of solid tumors.&#xD;
      However the incidence of biliary tract cancer is relatively higher in Korea compared to the&#xD;
      western countries. The prognosis of all biliary tract cancer is poor, that is, the 5-year&#xD;
      overall survival rate is 26.7%. The main reasons of poor prognosis are: 1) there is no&#xD;
      screening method to detect in early stage, 2) the relapse rate after curative surgery is&#xD;
      high, 3) in metastatic/recurrent biliary tract cancer, the chemo-sensitivity is relatively&#xD;
      low. And another important reason of poor prognosis is low interest of investigators. So the&#xD;
      researches with new agents have been limited compared with other types of cancer such as lung&#xD;
      cancer, breast cancer and colon cancer etc. In metastatic/recurrent biliary tract cancer, the&#xD;
      available cytotoxic chemotherapies are composed of gemcitabine, cisplatin, 5-FU, etc. The&#xD;
      most commonly used 1st-line chemotherapy is gemcitabine+cisplatin combination. (N Engl J Med&#xD;
      2010; 362 (14): 1273-81) There is no standard 2nd-line chemotherapy so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall survival with these cytotoxic chemotherapies is about 8-10 months. So far, there&#xD;
      is no validated targeted therapeutic agent in biliary tract cancer, even though this tumor&#xD;
      harbors diverse genetic characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, there is a huge unmet medical need in biliary tract cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TH-302 (1-methyl-2-nitro-1H-imidazole-5-yl)methyl N,N'-bis(2-bromoethyl) diamidophos-phate is&#xD;
      a nitroimidazole-linked prodrug of a brominated version of isophosphoramide mustard (Br-IPM).&#xD;
      When exposed to hypoxic conditions, TH-302 is reduced at the nitroimadazole site of the&#xD;
      prodrug by intracellular reductases leading to the release of Br-IPM. Br-IPM can then act as&#xD;
      a DNA crosslinking agent. Tumors often consist of large areas of highly hypoxic regions that&#xD;
      are known to be resistant to chemotherapy and radiation treatment. In areas of normoxia,&#xD;
      TH-302 remains intact as a prodrug and toxicity is minimized. Thus, TH-302 has been designed&#xD;
      to target these highly hypoxic tumor regions and this makes it an attractive candidate for&#xD;
      clinical development. In addition, preclinical data suggest that after activation, the active&#xD;
      moiety may diffuse to areas outside the hypoxic region, demonstrating a &quot;bystander&quot; effect&#xD;
      and possibly exhibiting additional anti-tumor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well known that biliary tract cancer is hypovascular tumor, so it contains large&#xD;
      hypoxic area in the tumor. Therefore it would be worthy to test TH-302 in biliary tract&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a phase II study of TH-302 monotherapy as second-line treatment in advanced&#xD;
      biliary tract cancer.&#xD;
