  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to determine the safety and feasibility of injecting irinotecan&#xD;
      hydrochloride drug-eluting beads directly into the cavity remaining after a tumor is&#xD;
      surgically removed in patients with a type of brain tumor (glioblastoma multiforme - also&#xD;
      known as glioma) that has returned after prior therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A challenge in the treatment of glioma is the delivery of treatment to the brain after&#xD;
      systemic administration due to the blood brain barrier. To improve drug delivery to the brain&#xD;
      to achieve very high local concentrations of the anti-neoplastic agent with low system&#xD;
      toxicity, a local regional approach is proposed. CM-BC2, an irinotecan hydrochloride&#xD;
      drug-eluting bead, is an investigational medicinal product intended for direction injection&#xD;
      into the tumor resection margin. The objective of this trial is demonstration of safety and&#xD;
      feasibility of this intraparenchymal injection of irinotecan hydrochloride drug-eluting beads&#xD;
      in the treatment of recurrent Glioblastoma multiforme.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. histologically confirmed diagnosis of Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) (World Health&#xD;
             Organization grade IV)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. recurrent disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. patient will be considered a good candidate for resection and will have estimated life&#xD;
             expectancy of at least 12 weeks as estimated by the Principal Investigator or&#xD;
             designee. The decision to opt for resection of the recurrence must be independent of&#xD;
             study selection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Tumour characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Single unilateral and supratentorial lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  On clinician's assessment, must be operable under normal considerations of risk&#xD;
                  vs. benefit for condition and prognosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. patient will have received conventional treatment at the time of initial diagnosis,&#xD;
             including surgery (biopsy or de-bulking), and/or radiotherapy, and/or chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. male or female; no racial exclusions; at least 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Pregnancy must be excluded in female patients by beta- HCG (Human Chorionic&#xD;
             Gonadotropin); all patients agree to use adequate contraception for study duration&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Karnofsky Performance Status of at least 60&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients must be able to understand consent and study instructions as well as follow&#xD;
             prescribed instructions&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. patient must have signed written informed consent prior to study participation&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. patient must not be enrolled in any other clinical trial for 30 days before or after&#xD;
             participation in this trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical make-up or&#xD;

             irinotecan therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. open communication between the ventricle CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) and tumour&#xD;
             resection cavity/site must be avoided. In the case of opening ventricles during&#xD;
             surgery, the surgeon must decide whether effective closure is possible by obstructing&#xD;
             the gap with Gelfoam/other appropriate materials&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Tumor surgery, other than stereotactic biopsy of the GBM, or other neurosurgery within&#xD;
             30 days prior to study entry&#xD;

          5. Multiple GBM lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Irinotecan chemotherapy within 30 days prior to study treatment&#xD;

             entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. loco-regional (intra-cranial) therapy for the treatment of GBM, including&#xD;
             administration of biodegradable polymer wafers containing Carmustine and/or&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Significant liver function impairment: aminotransferase (AST) or alanine transaminase&#xD;
             (ALT) greater than 2.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN), or total bilirubin greater&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. significant renal impairment: creatinine greater than 2.0 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Coagulopathy Prothrombin time (PT) or partial thromboplastin time (APTT) of less than&#xD;
             1.5 x control, and/or platelet count of less than 100 x 10⁹/L&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Hb less than 8 g/dL and/or neutrophil count (ANC - Absolute Neutrophil Count) of less&#xD;
             than 1 x 10⁹/L&#xD;
