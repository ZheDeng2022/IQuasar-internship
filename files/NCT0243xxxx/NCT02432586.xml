      18 preschool aged children and their families will attend structured, multidisciplinary,&#xD;
      family-centered intensive education sessions over a 3-day weekend in a residential camp&#xD;
      setting to address the unique challenges of managing type 1 diabetes mellitus in young&#xD;
      children. A second 'booster' session, will be conducted 6 months later.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose to deliver a structured multidisciplinary family-centered intervention over a&#xD;
      3-day weekend, with a second similar &quot;booster&quot; session 6 months later. The intervention will&#xD;
      be based at our regional diabetes camp, Camp Sweeney. The proposed camp encounters aim to&#xD;
      provide:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An opportunity for intensive education beyond that achievable in a single class, and&#xD;
           without the unfavorable impacts of multiple weekday classes on family and work time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Varied educational modalities including didactic sessions, practical demonstrations and&#xD;
           role playing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Close observation of each child throughout the day and night by experienced diabetes&#xD;
           counselors and medical staff to identify and help correct maladaptive family behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A safe environment where parents can participate in group therapy sessions without child&#xD;
           care worries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An opportunity for age-appropriate child-centered educational and therapeutic&#xD;
           activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An opportunity for families to form mutually-supportive friendships.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fun weekends away where the parents have help caring for their diabetic children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct this pilot study, which will enroll 18 preschool children age 3-5.5 years,&#xD;
      with the goal of obtaining preliminary results for 15 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome, to be determined approximately one month before and after each of the&#xD;
      two camp sessions, is improvement in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). This outcome will be compared&#xD;
      with that of historical controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared with pretreatment baseline and historical controls, subjects attending two 3-day&#xD;
      sessions at a family diabetes camp will improve:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HbA1c 3 months after the first camp session&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypoglycemia frequency, as measured by continuous glucose monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical system utilization, as measured by telephone call frequency and also by&#xD;
           emergency room visits and hospitalizations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Behavioral/QoL assessments, including the parents of young children version of the&#xD;
           hypoglycemia fear survey (HFS-P-YC), the Behavioral Pediatrics Feeding Assessment Scale&#xD;
           (BPFAS), and the general and diabetes modules of the PedsQL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diabetes knowledge, assessed by questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Development of friendships between subject families, assessed by questionnaire&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 3-5.5 years old (+/- 2 months) at the date of first camp session they are eligible&#xD;
             to join.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Child and Parents fluent in either English or Spanish.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Type 1 diabetes mellitus diagnosed for at least 10 months previous to date of first&#xD;
             camp they are eligible to join.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Taking insulin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Custodial parent or guardian (preferable both parents or guardians) willing to attend&#xD;
             both session of camp and the activities scheduled for them.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parent or guardian must sign consent before any study procedures are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neonatal diabetes (diagnosis in the first 3 months of life) or documented MODY; i.e.,&#xD;
             a likely genetic form of diabetes rather than an autoimmune etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Post-surgical diabetes (e.g., pancreatectomy for congenital hyperinsulinism). Such&#xD;
             patients often cannot secrete glucagon, leading to a particularly severe inability to&#xD;
             defend against hypoglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other severe chronic disease (e.g., cancer, cystic fibrosis) which in the judgment of&#xD;
             the investigator is likely to significantly affect glycemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients cannot be taking systemic corticosteroids at enrollment because of adverse&#xD;
             effects on glycemic control, but we will not disqualify subjects who require such&#xD;
             therapy during the study. Inhaled or topical corticosteroids are permissible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism must be clinically euthyroid and have&#xD;
             free T4 and TSH within age-appropriate reference ranges at last medically indicated&#xD;
             testing. Patients with out of range values may be retested after medication dose&#xD;
             adjustment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Developmental delay or behavioral disorder in the patient of sufficient severity, in&#xD;
             the judgment of the investigator, to interfere with group activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical or psychiatric disorder in a parent of sufficient severity, in the judgment of&#xD;
             the investigator, to interfere with group activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Celiac disease is not an exclusion criterion.&#xD;
