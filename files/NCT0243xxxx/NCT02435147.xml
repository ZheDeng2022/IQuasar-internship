      The purpose of this study is to validate the long-term benefit of denosumab for osteoporosis&#xD;
      treatment in a real-world clinical practice setting. We hypothesize that continued therapy&#xD;
      (36+months) with denosumab will increase both trabecular bone score (TBS) and femur strength&#xD;
      index (FSI) and reduce fracture and other bone health risks among post-menopausal women with&#xD;
      osteoporosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bone fractures are a major cause of morbidity and health care expense among patients with&#xD;
      osteoporosis.The goal of osteoporosis therapy is to reduce fracture risk. The administration&#xD;
      of denosumab 60 mg subcutaneously (SC) every six months has been shown to limit bone&#xD;
      turnover, increase bone mineral density (BMD), and reduce the risk for new vertebral,&#xD;
      non-vertebral, and hip fractures among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (Cummings,&#xD;
      2009). Although BMD is an important factor for fracture risk, it does not describe bone&#xD;
      microarchitecture, which is related to bone quality and mechanical bone strength. Trabecular&#xD;
      bone score (TBS) is an index for bone microarchitecture extracted from anterior-posterior&#xD;
      spine dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Previous research has shown TBS to&#xD;
      differentiate between women with and without fractures as well as predict future fracture&#xD;
      even after adjustment for BMD (Simonelli, Leib, Winzenrieth, &amp; Hans, 2012). In a study of&#xD;
      29,407 Canadian women age 50 years and older at the time of baseline hip and spine DXA,&#xD;
      health service records were assessed to determine the incidence of non-traumatic osteoporotic&#xD;
      fractures subsequent to BMD testing. Lumbar spine TBS was derived for each DXA examination&#xD;
      and blinded to clinical parameters and outcomes. Osteoporotic fractures were identified in&#xD;
      1668 (5.7%) women, including 439 (1.5%) spine and 293 (1.0%) hip fractures. Significantly&#xD;
      lower spine TBS and BMD were found in women with major osteoporotic, spine, and hip fractures&#xD;
      (p&lt;0.0001). The results of this study suggest that spine TBS is predictive of osteoporotic&#xD;
      fractures and provides additional clinical information independent of spine and hip BMD;&#xD;
      therefore, combining TBS trabecular texture index with BMD incrementally improves fracture&#xD;
      prediction in postmenopausal women (Hans, Goertzen, Krieg, &amp; Leslie, 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical research has demonstrated the positive effect of denosumab on TBS over time. In a&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 215 postmenopausal women with low BMD&#xD;
      at the spine or total hip, denosumab (60mg SC every 6 months) was found to increase lumbar&#xD;
      spine QCT, DXA, and TBS at 12 months compared to placebo or alendronate (Thomas, 2013). In&#xD;
      another study conducted by McClung et al, postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who received&#xD;
      denosumab were found to have significant increases in TBS, independent of BMD, at 36 months&#xD;
      compared to baseline and placebo (McClung, Lippuner, Brandi, Kaufman, Zanchetta, &amp; Krieg,&#xD;
      2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Femur strength index (FSI), which is a measure of femoral bone density, structure, and&#xD;
      strength, has also been shown to predict hip fracture independent of bone density and hip&#xD;
      axis length. In a study which compared FSI in a group of women age 50 years and older with&#xD;
      and without hip fracture (365 with prior hip fracture and 2,141 controls), FSI was found to&#xD;
      be significantly lower in the fracture group, after adjusting for T score and hip axis length&#xD;
      (Faulkner, et al., 2006). Like TBS, FSI can be obtained from femur DXA measurements using&#xD;
      modern software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-site, open-label, non-randomized, observational study designed to assess the&#xD;
      change in TBS and FSI at 36 months. among post-menopausal women with osteoporosis taking&#xD;
      denosumab. All patients included in this study are under the medical care of the principal&#xD;
      investigator. Subjects will enter the study once they have completed 36 months of treatment&#xD;
      with denosumab and have evaluable DXA scans. Medical records will be retrospectively reviewed&#xD;
      and percent change in TBS and FSI scores will be calculated.&#xD;

          <title>Trabecular Bone Score</title>
          <description>Trabecular Bone Score (TBS) is an index for bone micro-architecture extracted from anterior-posterior spine dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) images. TBS quantifies local variations in pixel intensities and is derived from the experimental variogram obtained from the gray levels of a DXA image. As noted in the Journal of Bone Mineral Research Volume 29, Issue 3, March 2014, pages 518-530, &quot;TBS&gt; or = 1.350 is considered to be normal; TBS between 1.200 and 1.350 is considered to be consistent with partially degraded microarchitecture, and TBS &lt;/=1.200 defines degraded microarchitecture&quot;.</description>

          <title>Femur Strength Index</title>
          <description>Femur strength index (FSI) is a measure of femoral bone density, structure and strength obtained from DXA measurements using modern software. FSI provides an index for hip strength by combining bone mineral density, femur geometry, age, height, and weight.This index is not anchored in definite values, but rather is derived from the following equation: Hip Strength Index= strength/stress where, strength=185-0.34 (age-45); Age&gt;45 years. Stress=moment*y/CSM I+ force/CSA. Higher values indicate greater hip strength.</description>
