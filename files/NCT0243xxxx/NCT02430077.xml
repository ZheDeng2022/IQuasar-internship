  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lipodystrophies are rare disorders characterized by selective loss of adipose tissue and&#xD;
      predisposition to insulin resistance and its metabolic complications. Hepatic steatosis is a&#xD;
      common complication in patients with partial and generalized lipodystrophies.Despite&#xD;
      aggressive management of diabetes and hyperlipidemia, hepatic steatosis and its complications&#xD;
      present a therapeutic challenge in many patients. Due to this large disease burden, it is&#xD;
      important to assess the efficacy and safety of novel therapies for hepatic steatosis in&#xD;
      patients with lipodystrophies.There are, however, no systematic studies evaluating various&#xD;
      therapeutic interventions for reducing hepatic steatosis in patients with lipodystrophies. A&#xD;
      variety of drugs have been investigated in nonlipodystrophic patients with non-alcoholic&#xD;
      hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis (NASH) or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).&#xD;
      Recent data support the activation of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR, NR1H4), a nuclear&#xD;
      hormone receptor regulated by bile acids, for treatment of NASH and NAFLD. FXR activates&#xD;
      transcription of several genes particularly the atypical nuclear receptor small heterodimer&#xD;
      partner (SHP, NR0B2) and thus can influence triglyceride metabolism within hepatocytes.Both&#xD;
      cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are ligands for FXR, however, UDCA which is&#xD;
      the 7 hydroxy β-epimer of CDCA, does not activate FXR. Obeticholic acid (OCA) is a&#xD;
      first-in-class selective FXR agonist which has approximately 100 fold greater FXR-agonistic&#xD;
      activity in the nanomolar range, as compared to CDCA .It therefore appears that FXR&#xD;
      modulation offers interesting therapeutic possibilities in treating hepatic steatosis. This&#xD;
      study is primarily designed to study efficacy of OCA, a strong FXR ligand, in reducing&#xD;
      hepatic triglyceride levels in patients with hepatic steatosis and Familial Partial&#xD;
      Lipodystrophy (FPLD). If proven to be effective, it may reduce morbidity and mortality as a&#xD;
      result of sequelae of hepatic steatosis in patients with lipodystrophies.&#xD;

      This study will be a randomized, placebo-controlled cross-over trial. Patients who are&#xD;
      considered eligible for the study will undergo screening evaluation to determine their&#xD;
      eligibility for the trial. For those who are found to be eligible, during the baseline&#xD;
      period, they will continue their usual diet and other lifestyle measures without changing any&#xD;
      medications for 1 month in order to establish a baseline state. Three blood samples will be&#xD;
      obtained during this period at the Clinical and Translational Research Center. Following the&#xD;
      baseline period, the patients will receive obeticholic acid (OCA) or an identical placebo in&#xD;
      the dose of 25 mg/day for a period of 4 months and then will receive the other treatment (OCA&#xD;
      or placebo) for 4 months. There will be a wash-out period of 4 months in-between the two&#xD;
      study periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be educated to maintain their usual physical activities and diet during the&#xD;
      study. The subjects will be admitted to the Clinical and Translational Research Center for&#xD;
      the baseline evaluations (at the beginning of the two study periods), and at the end of four&#xD;
      months during each study period.&#xD;
