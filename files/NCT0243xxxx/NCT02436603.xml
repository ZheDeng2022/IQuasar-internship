      The purpose of this project is to examine whether a low cost, group-oriented integrative&#xD;
      medicine approach to irritable bowel syndrome improves participant outcomes. The intervention&#xD;
      will combine nutrition counseling on the low FODMAP diet (decreased grains and other&#xD;
      disaccharides) and mind-body training with follow-up health coaching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These participants will be randomized to either a 4-week group-oriented treatment&#xD;
      intervention incorporating a low FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides,&#xD;
      monosaccharides and polyols) diet and mind-body therapies followed by an 8-week health&#xD;
      coaching follow-up period or a waitlist control group. At the end of the 12-week study&#xD;
      period, waitlist subjects will be offered the four-week nutrition and mind-body intervention.&#xD;
      Over the 12-week study period, we will examine and report on the impact of this treatment&#xD;
      intervention on IBS symptoms and quality of life in this population. The investigators will&#xD;
      collect data on IBS outcomes as well as on depression and stress.&#xD;

      This project will test the effectiveness of an integrative medicine approach in treating&#xD;
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Over the course of 18 months, we will recruit 85 participants&#xD;
      with IBS in New York City. These participants will be randomized to either a 4-week&#xD;
      group-oriented treatment intervention incorporating a low FODMAP (fermentable&#xD;
      oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) diet and mind-body therapies&#xD;
      followed by an 8-week health coaching follow-up period or a waitlist control group. At the&#xD;
      end of the 12-week study period, waitlist subjects will be offered the four-week nutrition&#xD;
      and mind-body intervention. Over the 12-week study period, we will examine and report on the&#xD;
      impact of this treatment intervention on IBS symptoms and quality of life in this population.&#xD;
      The investigators will collect data on IBS outcomes as well as on depression and stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that participants will report decreased symptoms and improved function and&#xD;
      quality of life as a result of the four-week nutrition and mind-body intervention and 8-week&#xD;
      health coaching follow-up period. The goal of this project is to develop a low-cost,&#xD;
      effective integrative intervention for IBS, which can be replicated in settings across the&#xD;
      U.S.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives The purpose of this project is to examine whether a low cost, group-oriented&#xD;
      integrative medicine approach to irritable bowel syndrome improves participant outcomes. The&#xD;
      intervention will combine nutrition counseling on the low FODMAP diet and mind-body training&#xD;
      with follow-up health coaching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that participants will report decreased symptoms as measured by the IBS&#xD;
      Symptom Severity Score and improved function and quality of life as a result of the&#xD;
      intervention when compared to usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic debilitating functional&#xD;
      gastrointestinal disorder that has a profound effect on the quality of life (QOL) of&#xD;
      individuals with IBS. The estimated prevalence of IBS in the general population ranges from&#xD;
      3% to 20%, with most studies estimating that IBS affects 10% to 15% of the general&#xD;
      population. Despite its high level of prevalence, the exact causes of IBS are not well&#xD;
      understood. Researchers believe that IBS is caused by a wide variety of mental and physical&#xD;
      health problems including hypersensitivity, brain-gut signal issues, bacterial&#xD;
      gastroenteritis, depression, anxiety, food sensitivity, body chemical imbalances, and/or&#xD;
      genetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Low FODMAP Diet for IBS More than 60% of IBS patients report worsening of&#xD;
      symptoms after meals, 28% of these within 15 minutes after eating and 93% within 3 hours. The&#xD;
      role of diet in inducing or exacerbating IBS systems has been explored for decades. Numerous&#xD;
      studies have examined the role of lactose intolerance and fructose malabsorption in IBS.&#xD;
      Additional research on oligosaccharides and the incompletely absorbed sugar alcohol polyols,&#xD;
      sorbitol, and mannitol, has revealed a role in IBS symptoms. Grouping of these poorly&#xD;
      absorbed, short chain carbohydrates- fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides,&#xD;
      monosaccharides and polyols- according to their chain length resulted in the acronym FODMAP,&#xD;
      and in 2005, the first paper describing the FODMAP hypothesis was published. Evidence&#xD;
      continues to accumulate that the consumption of FODMAPs may contribute to symptoms in&#xD;
      individuals with IBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FODMAPs are poorly absorbed, osmotically active, and increase delivery of water and&#xD;
      fermentable substrates to the proximal colon and are rapidly fermented by bacteria. The poor&#xD;
      absorption and fermentation of the short chain carbohydrates contributes to the bloating,&#xD;
      distension, abdominal pain, and flatulence of individuals with IBS. In a comparison of&#xD;
      standard dietary advice versus FODMAP for individuals with IBS, a low FODMAP diet showed&#xD;
      significantly greater reduction in abdominal pain, bloating, and flatulence compared to the&#xD;
      standard dietary advice group. A high FODMAP diet altered the pattern of gas production,&#xD;
      induced prolonged hydrogen production in the intestine that was greater in individuals with&#xD;
      IBS versus healthy controls, influenced the amount of methane produced, and induced&#xD;
      gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms in individuals with IBS. A low FODMAP diet reduced&#xD;
      abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, and diarrhea in individuals with inflammatory bowel&#xD;
      disease. In a prospective study of 90 patients with IBS followed for 15 months, a low FODMAP&#xD;
      diet significantly decreased abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, and diarrhea, with greater&#xD;
      improvement with greater dietary adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Mind-Body Therapies for IBS Psychological therapies or mind-body therapies such&#xD;
      as hypnosis, biofeedback, and psychotherapy represent some of the most effective treatments&#xD;
      for IBS and are especially useful for motivated patients with moderate to severe IBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scientific evidence involving mind-body therapies for IBS began in 1927 when American&#xD;
      researcher, Dr. Edmund Jacobson, conducted the first randomized trial using progressive&#xD;
      relaxation for IBS treatment and found significant benefit. In recent years, a vast majority&#xD;
      of research surrounding mind-body approaches for IBS has come from a research group at&#xD;
      University Hospital in South Manchester, UK led by Dr. Peter Whorwell. In 1984, the Whorwell&#xD;
      group developed a hypnosis procedure specifically for treating IBS called &quot;gut directed&#xD;
      hypnotherapy&quot;. The intervention consists of seven half-hour sessions of decreasing frequency.&#xD;
      In addition, patients are all given self-hypnosis tapes for daily practice. A 2005 review&#xD;
      published by the American Society of Clinical Hypnosis examined 14 studies measuring efficacy&#xD;
      and mechanism of hypnosis for IBS treatment (12 of the 14 studies utilized an adaptation of&#xD;
      the Whorwell group procedure). Based on the studies investigated, the review concluded&#xD;
      &quot;hypnosis consistently produces significant results and improves the cardinal symptoms of IBS&#xD;
      in the majority of patients.&quot; A separate 2006 review conducted by researchers at the&#xD;
      University of Birmingham in England, concluded that existing scientific evidence suggest that&#xD;
      hypnosis is effective in the treatment and management of IBS (10 of the 18 studies examined&#xD;
      indicated significant benefit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding long-term benefit, the existing scientific evidence is supportive of mind-body&#xD;
      approaches for IBS treatment. A long-term follow-up study of IBS patients (n=204) treated&#xD;
      with hypnosis revealed that of the 71% who initially responded to hypnosis, 81% maintained&#xD;
      their improvement overtime while the remaining 19% reported only slight deterioration in&#xD;
      their IBS symptoms. Also important was that patients reported to be using fewer medications&#xD;
      to manage IBS following hypnosis treatment. In their conclusion, the study authors determined&#xD;
      that the benefits of hypnosis seemed to last for up to 5 years after treatment. A 1989&#xD;
      comparative study from England determined that hypnosis for treatment of IBS in groups of up&#xD;
      to 8 patients was as effective as individual therapy.&#xD;
