  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several prospective randomized trials have demonstrated that concurrent chemoradiotherapy was&#xD;
      superior to radiotherapy alone in the treatment of locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      carcinoma (NPC). Based on these evidences, concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with/without&#xD;
      sequential chemotherapy has become the standard care for locoregionally advanced NPC.&#xD;
      However, most of these evidences of standard treatment for locoregionally advanced NPC were&#xD;
      based on the two-dimensional conventional radiotherapy (2DCRT). As the intensity-modulated&#xD;
      radiation therapy (IMRT) technique has been widely used in the last decades, IMRT improved&#xD;
      the treatment outcomes of patients with NPC, especially the local control rate. Currently,&#xD;
      more retrospective studies compared the IMRT alone vs. IMRT plus concurrent chemotherapy, and&#xD;
      reported that concurrent chemotherapy failed to improve survival rates for patients with&#xD;
      locoregionally advanced disease, but increased the severity of acute toxicities. People&#xD;
      started to reconsider the role of CCRT. Therefore, we propose this randomized phase III&#xD;
      non-inferiority study to reassess the efficacy and contribution of concurrent chemotherapy in&#xD;
      locoregionally advanced NPC during IMRT era.&#xD;

      Patients with with previously untreated non-metastatic newly histologically-confirmed&#xD;
      non-keratinizing III-IVb NPC (UICC/AJCC 7th edition) are randomly assigned to receive&#xD;
      induction chemotherapy followed by IMRT alone (investigational group) or induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy followed by IMRT plus concurrent chemotherapy (control group). During induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy, patients in both groups receive 60 mg/m2 docetaxel intravenously on day 1, 60&#xD;
      mg/m2 cisplatin intravenously on day 1, and 600 mg/m2/d fluorouracil as a continuous infusion&#xD;
      on days 1-5; three cycles were administered at intervals of 3 weeks. During radiotherapy,&#xD;
      patients in investigational group received IMRT alone and patients in control group received&#xD;
      IMRT, concurrently with weekly intravenous cisplatin at 30 mg/m2 for 6-7 weeks. IMRT is given&#xD;
      as 2.0-2.3 Gy per fraction with five daily fractions per week for 6-7 weeks, Cumulative doses&#xD;
      were &gt; 66 Gy to the primary tumor and &gt; 50 Gy to the bilateral cervical lymph nodes and&#xD;
      potential sites of local infiltration. The primary endpoint is failure-free survival(FFS).&#xD;
      Secondary clinical endpoints include overall survival (OS), locoregional failure-free&#xD;
      survival (LRFFS), distant failure-free survival (DFFS) rates and toxic effects.&#xD;
