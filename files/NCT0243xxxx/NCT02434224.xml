    <textblock>
      This study investigates whether creative music therapy applied to premature infants will&#xD;
      facilitate brain growth and development at term equivalent assessed by magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging. Secondary objective are improvement of neurobehavioral outcomes of premature infants&#xD;
      at 24 months, as well as at 5 years of age.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Premature infants are a highly prevalent and vulnerable group in paediatric care, and face&#xD;
      several short- and long-term challenges. Research on brain development in premature infants&#xD;
      demonstrates a high incidence of white and grey matter abnormalities and neurobehavioral&#xD;
      delay, as well as an increased risk of brain injury. There is growing awareness that&#xD;
      premature infants need individualized nurturing interactions with their caregivers while they&#xD;
      are in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to support healthy development and prevent&#xD;
      future difficulties. One particular intervention that may have considerable potential in the&#xD;
      NICU is creative music therapy (CMT), an individualized, interactive, resource- and&#xD;
      needs-oriented music therapy approach. Results demonstrate that CMT can facilitate relaxation&#xD;
      and stabilization in premature infants; by experiencing inter-subjectivity through music, the&#xD;
      infants can be empowered to engage in meaningful and nurturing interactions (Haslbeck, 2013&#xD;
      a,b) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several researchers (Als, 2012; Trevarthen, 2008; Schore, 2003) have described how&#xD;
      interactive and multi-sensory experiences of the fetus particularly facilitate brain&#xD;
      development and learning about socio-emotional figures, respectively, in prematurely born&#xD;
      infants. It is assumed that positive auditory experiences can promote premature infants'&#xD;
      early brain maturation and contribute to their healthy neurodevelopment (Xu et al., 2009).&#xD;
      Studies in music and neuroscience have demonstrated that music promotes neurobiological&#xD;
      processes and modulates synaptic plasticity, neuronal learning and readjustment in the human&#xD;
      brain (Rickard et al., 2005). The individualized approach in active music therapy may&#xD;
      especially activate brain structures involved in emotional, sensorimotor and cognitive&#xD;
      processing (Koelsch, 2009; Fachner et al., 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since, on one hand, individualized interactive experiences and, on the other hand, music may&#xD;
      alter brain development in the fetus and very young infants, the question arises as to&#xD;
      whether CMT might actually promote a premature infant's brain development by facilitating&#xD;
      nurturing socio-emotional and auditory interactive experiences at the same time. Therefore a&#xD;
      randomized, controlled, clinical trial will be conducted. 30 premature infants receive CMT&#xD;
      during their hospitalization time and 30 premature infants without music therapy serves as&#xD;
      control group. The primary objective is to explore if the experience of CMT in premature&#xD;
      infants improves their brain growth and development at 38-42 weeks of corrected gestational&#xD;
      age. The main secondary objective is to explore if CMT improves the neurobehavioral outcomes&#xD;
      of premature infants at 9 and 24 months, as well as at 5 years of age. Magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging is used to evaluate the infants' cerebral cortical development and myelination.&#xD;
      Electroencephalography (EEG) is used to evaluate the infants' brain function and maturation.&#xD;
      Insights into possible long-term and sustainable outcomes will be gained via&#xD;
      neuro-developmental follow-up examinations. It is hypothesized that the experience of CMT in&#xD;
      neonatal care improves both short- and long-term neurological outcomes. We expect that the&#xD;
      experimental group will demonstrate superior brain growth and development at 38-42 weeks of&#xD;
      corrected gestational age as well as improved cognitive, behavioral and motor developmental&#xD;
      outcomes later on. This paper will introduce first insights and preliminary results of the&#xD;
      ongoing study. Strategies and challenges inherent in conducting a controlled clinical trial&#xD;
      within this vulnerable group will be discussed.&#xD;
