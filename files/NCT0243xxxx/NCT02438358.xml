  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For most breast cancer patients, surgery is the primary treatment. When patients undergo a&#xD;
      lumpectomy, it is difficult for the surgeon to determine the extent of the tumor which&#xD;
      results in incomplete tumor removal as determined by a positive margin assessment several&#xD;
      days after the initial surgery is completed. Most patients with positive margins will undergo&#xD;
      a second or even a third surgery to complete the tumor removal. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that the LUM Imaging System can reduce the rates of positive margins and, thus, the rates of&#xD;
      second surgeries by identifying microscopic residual cancer in the tumor bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a non-randomized, open label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an&#xD;
      intraoperative imaging system, the LUM Imaging System (LUM015 in conjunction with LUM 2.6&#xD;
      Imaging Device), in identifying residual cancer in the tumor bed of female breast cancer&#xD;
      subjects. The study is composed of a Feasibility Trial divided into two phases: Phase A (15&#xD;
      total subjects) and Phase B (up to 50 total subjects). During Phase A, 15 subjects will be&#xD;
      evaluated to collect additional patient safety data, select the dose of LUM015 for Phase B&#xD;
      and evaluate the device function. During Phase B, subjects will be injected with LUM015 at&#xD;
      the dose determined during Phase A to preliminarily assess the performance of the detection&#xD;
      algorithm against pathology margin assessment. In Phase B, the surgeon will perform standard&#xD;
      of care surgery and then use the LUM Imaging System to guide the removal of additional cavity&#xD;
      shavings as indicated by the LUM Imaging System.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The LUM Imaging System consists of the cancer imaging agent LUM015 and a hand-held&#xD;
      fluorescence-based imager that collects the emission of activated LUM015 in and around tumor.&#xD;
      The LUM Imaging System is designed to detect microscopic residual cancer cells in real-time&#xD;
      within the tumor bed. In this study, we will evaluate the performance of the LUM Imaging&#xD;
      System in detecting residual cancer and guiding its removal during lumpectomies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase A, all patients will receive standard of care surgery followed by intraoperative&#xD;
      imaging of the tumor bed and resected tissue with the LUM 2.6 Imaging Device. In Phase A, no&#xD;
      clinical decisions are made based on the imaging results. Standard of care margin assessment&#xD;
      will be performed and compared against the imaging results with the LUM Imaging System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in Phase B will receive standard of care surgery followed by intraoperative imaging&#xD;
      of the tumor bed with the LUM Imaging System. In Phase B, the surgeon will remove an&#xD;
      additional shaved margin specimen if indicated by the LUM Imaging System. Final margin&#xD;
      assessment will be performed on the very last shaved margin specimen removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participating subjects will be observed to collect safety data from the time of injection&#xD;
      of LUM015 to the time the clinical team decides no additional surgery is needed.&#xD;
