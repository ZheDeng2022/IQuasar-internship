    <measure>Change From Baseline in Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The LSAS is a 24-item, semi-structured interview on the severity of Social Anxiety Disorder. The LSAS separately assesses fear and avoidance of 24 social situations. The scale is divided into 2 subscales, 13 situations concerning performance anxiety, and 11 situations pertaining to social situations. The 24 items are first rated on a Likert Scale from 0 to 3 on fear felt during the situations (0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3= severe), and then the same items are rated regarding avoidance of the situation (0=never, 1=occasionally, 2=often, 3=usually) with higher scores indicating greater social anxiety. The LSAS fear/anxiety and avoidance subscale was calculated by summing the 24 fear/anxiety and avoidance item scores of the LSAS, and ranges from 0 to 72. Combining the total scores for the Fear and Avoidance sections provides an overall score with a maximum of 144 points and a minimum of 0 points. Higher scores indicated higher probability of social anxiety disorder (SAD).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (SIGH-A) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The SIGH-A was included to determine the frequency and severity of signs and symptoms of anxiety, including participants with comorbid generalized anxiety disorders (GAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD), and determine both their influence on treatment and their responsiveness to treatment. The SIGH-A scale consists of 14 items with a score of 0 to 4. Higher scores indicated higher severity (0-absent, 1-mild, 2-moderate, 3-severe, 4-incapacitating). The SIGH-A total score was calculated by summing the 14 item scores, and ranges from 0 to 56. Higher scores indicated worse results.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM)-A6 Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-A6 is a 6-item subscale derived from the original Hamilton Anxiety scale (HAM-A). It comprises of five psychic anxiety symptoms: anxious mood, psychic tension, fears, intellectual disturbances, and anxious behavior observed at the interview, as well as one somatic item, muscular tension. Each of the 6 items is rated by the clinician on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (maximum degree). The HAM-A6 score was calculated by summing the 6 item scores, and ranges from 0 to 24. Higher scores indicated greater severity of symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS)-17 Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The HDRS-17 is a clinician-administered rating scale designed to assess the severity of symptoms in participants diagnosed with depression with a score range of 0 to 52. Each of the 17 items is rated by the clinician on either a 3-point (0 to 2) or a 5-point scale (0 to 4). The point scale used a rating of 0 (absent), 1 (doubtful to mild), 2 (mild to moderate), 3 (moderate to severe), and 4 (very severe). A total score (0 to 52) was calculated by adding the scores of all 17 items. For each item as well as the total score, a higher score represents a more severe condition.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in HDRS17 Anxiety/Somatization Factor Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The HDRS17 anxiety/somatization factor derived from Cleary and Guy's factor analysis of the HDRS17 scale, includes six items from the original 17-item version: the items for psychic anxiety, somatic anxiety, gastrointestinal somatic symptoms, general somatic symptoms, hypochondriasis, and insight. Each of these items is rated by the clinician on either a 3-point (0 to 2) or a 5-point scale (0 to 4). The point scale used a rating of 0 (absent), 1 (doubtful to mild), 2 (mild to moderate), 3 (moderate to severe), and 4 (very severe). HDRS17 anxiety/somatization factor total score was calculated as the sum of the 6 item scores ranging from 0 to 18. Higher scores indicated greater severity of symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in HAM-D6 Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>A 6-item subscale from the HDRS17 (HAM-D6) was analyzed as it had been shown to be a uni-dimensional scale that provided information to core depressive symptoms and was sensitive to treatment response. The six items were: depressed mood, guilt feelings, work and interests, psychomotor retardation, psychic anxiety, and general somatics (tiredness and pains). Each of these items is rated by the clinician on either a 3-point (0 to 2) or a 5-point scale (0 to 4). The point scale used a rating of 0 (absent), 1 (doubtful to mild), 2 (mild to moderate), 3 (moderate to severe), and 4 (very severe). General somatics is scored 0 to 2 and all others are scored 0 to 4. The HAM-D6 total score was calculated by summing the 6 items scores, and ranges from 0 to 22. Higher scores indicated greater severity of core symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression- Improvement (CGI-I) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to assess how much the participant's illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention. The CGI-I is rated as: 1=very much improved; 2=much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change; 5=minimally worse; 6=much worse; 7=very much worse. Percentage of participants with change from baseline (very much improved or much improved and Worsening or no change) in CGI-I score were reported.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) Total Score</title>
        <description>The LSAS is a 24-item, semi-structured interview on the severity of Social Anxiety Disorder. The LSAS separately assesses fear and avoidance of 24 social situations. The scale is divided into 2 subscales, 13 situations concerning performance anxiety, and 11 situations pertaining to social situations. The 24 items are first rated on a Likert Scale from 0 to 3 on fear felt during the situations (0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3= severe), and then the same items are rated regarding avoidance of the situation (0=never, 1=occasionally, 2=often, 3=usually) with higher scores indicating greater social anxiety. The LSAS fear/anxiety and avoidance subscale was calculated by summing the 24 fear/anxiety and avoidance item scores of the LSAS, and ranges from 0 to 72. Combining the total scores for the Fear and Avoidance sections provides an overall score with a maximum of 144 points and a minimum of 0 points. Higher scores indicated higher probability of social anxiety disorder (SAD).</description>

The 24 items are first rated on a Likert Scale from 0 to 3 on fear felt during the situations (0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3= severe), and then the same items are rated regarding avoidance of the situation (0=never, 1=occasionally, 2=often, 3=usually) with higher scores indicating greater social anxiety. The LSAS fear/anxiety and avoidance subscale was calculated by summing the 24 fear/anxiety and avoidance item scores of the LSAS, and ranges from 0 to 72. Combining the total scores for the Fear and Avoidance sections provides an overall score with a maximum of 144 points and a minimum of 0 points. Higher scores indicated higher probability of social anxiety disorder (SAD).</description>

        <description>The HAM-A6 is a 6-item subscale derived from the original Hamilton Anxiety scale (HAM-A). It comprises of five psychic anxiety symptoms: anxious mood, psychic tension, fears, intellectual disturbances, and anxious behavior observed at the interview, as well as one somatic item, muscular tension. Each of the 6 items is rated by the clinician on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (maximum degree). The HAM-A6 score was calculated by summing the 6 item scores, and ranges from 0 to 24. Higher scores indicated greater severity of symptoms.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS)-17 Total Score</title>
        <description>The HDRS-17 is a clinician-administered rating scale designed to assess the severity of symptoms in participants diagnosed with depression with a score range of 0 to 52. Each of the 17 items is rated by the clinician on either a 3-point (0 to 2) or a 5-point scale (0 to 4). The point scale used a rating of 0 (absent), 1 (doubtful to mild), 2 (mild to moderate), 3 (moderate to severe), and 4 (very severe). A total score (0 to 52) was calculated by adding the scores of all 17 items. For each item as well as the total score, a higher score represents a more severe condition.</description>

        <population>ITT analysis set included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of the study agent (either placebo or JNJ-42165279), and had at least 1 assessment in the double-blind treatment phase on any of the efficacy parameters.</population>

        <description>The HDRS17 anxiety/somatization factor derived from Cleary and Guy's factor analysis of the HDRS17 scale, includes six items from the original 17-item version: the items for psychic anxiety, somatic anxiety, gastrointestinal somatic symptoms, general somatic symptoms, hypochondriasis, and insight. Each of these items is rated by the clinician on either a 3-point (0 to 2) or a 5-point scale (0 to 4). The point scale used a rating of 0 (absent), 1 (doubtful to mild), 2 (mild to moderate), 3 (moderate to severe), and 4 (very severe). HDRS17 anxiety/somatization factor total score was calculated as the sum of the 6 item scores ranging from 0 to 18. Higher scores indicated greater severity of symptoms.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in HAM-D6 Total Score</title>
        <description>A 6-item subscale from the HDRS17 (HAM-D6) was analyzed as it had been shown to be a uni-dimensional scale that provided information to core depressive symptoms and was sensitive to treatment response. The six items were: depressed mood, guilt feelings, work and interests, psychomotor retardation, psychic anxiety, and general somatics (tiredness and pains). Each of these items is rated by the clinician on either a 3-point (0 to 2) or a 5-point scale (0 to 4). The point scale used a rating of 0 (absent), 1 (doubtful to mild), 2 (mild to moderate), 3 (moderate to severe), and 4 (very severe). General somatics is scored 0 to 2 and all others are scored 0 to 4. The HAM-D6 total score was calculated by summing the 6 items scores, and ranges from 0 to 22. Higher scores indicated greater severity of core symptoms.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>The US food and drug administration placed a clinical hold on studies being conducted with fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitor. When determined that serious adverse events were not related to FAAH inhibition, Janssen resumed this study in December 2016. At time of study suspension, an unblinded safety analysis was performed, and hence sample size was increased to replace participants who withdrew due to study suspension. Planned analyses were performed at time of final database lock.</limitations_and_caveats>
