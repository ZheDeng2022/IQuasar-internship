    <textblock>
      CommunityRx is a health information technology-based innovation that, starting with the&#xD;
      patient-health care provider encounter, facilitates self-care coordination for patients,&#xD;
      caregivers, and providers. The CommunityRx database interfaces with electronic medical&#xD;
      records to provide patients with a &quot;HealtheRx.&quot; A HealtheRx is a list of community-based&#xD;
      self-care resources tailored to the patients health needs (e.g., a person with diabetes&#xD;
      receives information about podiatrists, nutrition classes, and other resources need to manage&#xD;
      diabetes). CommunityRx aims to measurably improve health and health care while reducing&#xD;
      health care costs especially in underserved health care settings. Specifically, the proposed&#xD;
      research aims to 1) evaluate the impact of CommunityRx on health care utilization, cost,&#xD;
      health, and patient-centered outcomes for program participants compared to controls; 2)&#xD;
      examine the flow and spread of information to and through primary agents including: program&#xD;
      participants, community health information experts, healthcare providers, and community-based&#xD;
      service providers (businesses and organizations providing self-care resources); and 3) build&#xD;
      and use an agent-based model to test the distributed impact, including economic effects, of&#xD;
      CommunityRx system adoption on the demonstration area and predict performance over time by&#xD;
      conducting experiments that vary assumptions about agent, environment, and population-level&#xD;
      characteristics.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      CommunityRx connects health care to self-care. CommunityRx begins with the medical encounter&#xD;
      and functions like an e-prescribing system, modeled after medication e-prescribing.9 Rather&#xD;
      than sending a medication prescription to the patient's pharmacy, a HealtheRx &quot;prescription&quot;&#xD;
      is automatically generated at the point of care, delivered to the patient in paper (or&#xD;
      electronic) form and stored in the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) for future reference. The&#xD;
      HealtheRx is ontologically-generated, driven by standard demographic (eg. age, gender,&#xD;
      address, language) data fields in the EMR and customized to patient problems/diagnoses like&#xD;
      &quot;homelessness,&quot; or &quot;obesity.&quot; Like e-prescribing medicine, CommunityRx involves prescribing,&#xD;
      fulfillment (patient signs up for a Weight Watchers class), and administration (patient&#xD;
      participates in the weight loss program) (Fig. 2).10 The HealtheRx prescription is the&#xD;
      primary information agent in the system, driven by simple ontologic rules that generate&#xD;
      complexity, including iteration of the CommunityRx system itself, as human agents interact&#xD;
      with the self-care information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CommunityRx can be best understood as part of a complex adaptive system. The HealtheRx, in&#xD;
      contrast to a drug prescription, is designed specifically to enhance the interpersonal aspect&#xD;
      of the patient-physician encounter, informing both agents about self-care resources. A&#xD;
      patient receives a HealtheRx and then contacts a Community Health Information Specialist&#xD;
      (CHIS) or not. She seeks self-care resources or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data captured by the CommunityRx system about patient referrals and needs are distributed to&#xD;
      community-based service providers (CBSPs) in the form of quarterly reports delivered to CBSP&#xD;
      contacts cultivated by CHIS. These data efficiently reveal to CBSPs real-time needs and gaps&#xD;
      in self-care resources. The investigators hypothesize these data will be used by CBSPs over&#xD;
      time to ensure supply. Youth who generate community resource data through employment with&#xD;
      MAPSCorps also gain insight to community resources and engage with CBSP personnel and CHIS as&#xD;
      they gather their data. Youth spread information to their networks about community resources&#xD;
      and increase their use of these resources. MAPSCorps data about community resources are&#xD;
      shared publicly (www.healtherx.org, www.southsidehealth.org, www.dondeesta.org). Self-care&#xD;
      becomes more efficient. Supply meets demand. Patients and providers have more time and&#xD;
      resources to devote to other salubrious activities and CBSPs become stronger. Over time,&#xD;
      transparency in the market for self-care resources increases competition and quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This hypothetical dynamic is an example of emergent self-organization from a complex adaptive&#xD;
      system. The intervention starts with a simple encounter, governed by simple rules, between&#xD;
      patient and health care provider. As the number of these encounters grow, previously siloed&#xD;
      sectors - health care and self-care - evolve a new kind of formation that is far more&#xD;
      efficient for the community than the current state. CommunityRx drives this new formation&#xD;
      through multiple agents who are unaware of the complexity they are producing: &quot;â€¦the&#xD;
      self-organized structure simply emerges as a result of each individual doing their own thing,&#xD;
      independently.&quot; In evaluating the economic effects of CommunityRx adoption, agent-based&#xD;
      modeling (ABM) can test how close the attractor state, or end-point in a CommunityRx system&#xD;
      configuration (set of assumed behaviors and designed interventions), comes to a Pareto&#xD;
      efficient point of equilibrium. The effects of the CommunityRx intervention are non-linear,&#xD;
      involve interactions and feedback loops, and therefore require a complex system modeling&#xD;
      approach for evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Purpose or Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data inputs for agent based modeling (ABM) can come from a range of sources, including&#xD;
      empirical quantitative and qualitative data, data from the literature, and expert opinion.&#xD;
      Because CommunityRx targets people of all ages (0-99 yrs, to date), a prospective,&#xD;
      experimental, community-based design (eg. RCT) to assess outcomes by age strata would be very&#xD;
      informative about patient agents (the investigators expect age-group differences in behavior,&#xD;
      social networks, and outcomes) but cost-prohibitive. ABM can accommodate assumptions made&#xD;
      based on this important, but specific, population subgroup (or &quot;testbed&quot;), includes many&#xD;
      agents, and allows for multiple simulations to assess the impact of variations in those&#xD;
      assumptions for the much larger and more diverse population that the system-wide model&#xD;
      includes. A cost-effectiveness analysis is needed to understand the true economic impact of&#xD;
      CommunityRx on the total cost of the burden of disease. In addition, the research team brings&#xD;
      clinical and research expertise and specialized interest in middle-age and older adult&#xD;
      populations with chronic disease. Focusing on this subgroup builds on this track record and&#xD;
      will meaningfully extend our contributions to the gerontology and geriatrics fields.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the aims (and associated hypotheses) of this research include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Evaluate the impact of CommunityRx on health care utilization, cost, health, and&#xD;
      patient-centered outcomes for program participants (patients who receive care at the clinical&#xD;
      demonstration sites and live in an 16 zip code area) compared to controls (patients who&#xD;
      receive health care at the demonstration sites, but live outside the 16 zip code area), with&#xD;
      a special focus on middle-age and older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1a. Evaluate the impact of CommunityRx on health care utilization, health care costs, and&#xD;
      on health outcomes for program participants (patients who receive care at the clinical&#xD;
      demonstration sites and live in an 16 zip code area) compared to controls (patients who&#xD;
      receive health care at the demonstration sites, but live outside the 11 zip code area) of all&#xD;
      ages. NOTE: This aim is funded separately and registered on clinicaltrials.gov separately&#xD;
      (see ID 1C1CMS330997).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: CommunityRx will decrease emergency/inpatient care utilization, decrease percent&#xD;
      per beneficiary per year (%PBPY) costs and improve health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1b. Evaluate the impact of the CommunityRx system on patient-centered outcomes in a&#xD;
      randomized control trail of 200 program participants ages 45-74 and compared to 200 controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: CommunityRx will be associated with clinically meaningful improvements in: a)&#xD;
      self-care behavior; b) perceived care quality; and c) quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1c. Characterize the economic value of care augmented with the CommunityRx system&#xD;
      compared to usual care, based on the prospective participant-control study described in Aim&#xD;
      1b.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Compared to usual care, care augmented with the CommunityRx system will be as&#xD;
      cost-effective as commonly accepted medical devices and treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Examine the flow and spread of information to and through primary agents including:&#xD;
      program participants, community health information specialists, healthcare providers, and&#xD;
      community-based service providers (businesses and organizations providing self-care&#xD;
      resources).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: 1) Among the CBSPs receiving high volumes of CommunityRx referrals for people â‰¥45&#xD;
      years old (&gt;1000/year), CommunityRx will produce a self-reported increase in: a) knowledge of&#xD;
      community resources especially for older adults, b) referrals to other CBSPs, c) older client&#xD;
      volume, and d) aging-related goods/services /programs inventory; and 2) Delivery of the&#xD;
      CommunityRx intervention at the point of medical care produces knowledge about self-care&#xD;
      resources in the community that spreads to secondary agents including members of patient and&#xD;
      provider social networks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. Build and use an agent-based model to test the distributed impact, including economic&#xD;
      effects, of CommunityRx adoption on the demonstration area and predict performance over time&#xD;
      by conducting experiments that vary assumptions about agent, environment, and&#xD;
      population-level characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: 1) The system-level value of CommunityRx is greater than the value quantified as&#xD;
      %PBPY health care utilization savings and is projected to increase with population aging; 2)&#xD;
      Experiments run on a systems-based model will predict and quantify the impact of strategies&#xD;
      to optimize CommunityRx performance for improvements, sustainability, and spread to other&#xD;
      settings; and 3) Systems-Based Modeling is an effective and efficient tool for large-scale&#xD;
      evaluation of a health information technology-based intervention to improve health and health&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
