  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the multiple dose safety and tolerability of RM-493&#xD;
      (setmelanotide) as well as pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD; weight loss)&#xD;
      profile, in healthy obese patients for 2 to 4 weeks. In addition, one panel of patients with&#xD;
      a specific genetic deficiency in the hypothalamic leptin- proopiomelanocortin (POMC) -&#xD;
      melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) pathway, those with heterozygous partial or full loss of&#xD;
      function (LOF) of the MC4R gene, will also be studied. The study drug (RM-493 and placebo)&#xD;
      will be administered subcutaneously in a blinded fashion by subcutaneous (SC) infusion or&#xD;
      injection.&#xD;
