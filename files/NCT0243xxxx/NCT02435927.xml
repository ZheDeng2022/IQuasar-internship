    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, dose escalation study of ASLAN001 given in combination with&#xD;
      CAPOX or mFolfox6, in patients with metastatic solid tumours, whom are suitable to receive&#xD;
      CAPOX or mFolfox6, or with tumours that have dysregulated EGFR or HER2 signaling.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will use standard 3+3 design to determine the MTD (maximum tolerated dose) of&#xD;
      ASLAN001 in combination with fixed dose of Oxaliplatin/Capecitabine (CAPOX) or&#xD;
      5-FU/leucovorin (mFolfox6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MTD of ASLAN001 in combination with CAPOX will first be determined followed by the&#xD;
      combination with mFolfox6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recommended Phase II dose will be the highest dose of the combination therapy that is&#xD;
      considered to be tolerated in 6 patients.&#xD;
