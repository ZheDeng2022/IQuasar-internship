      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions on lifestyle among adolescents are important, but the main mechanisms that&#xD;
      explain the changes (mediating variables) on lifestyle have been little explored.&#xD;
      Investigators present the rationale and methods of a cluster-randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      aimed to promote promotion active and healthy lifestyle (especially physical activity [PA]&#xD;
      practice and reducing screen time use) among Brazilian students - the &quot;Fortaleça sua Saúde&quot;&#xD;
      (&quot;Strengthen Your Health&quot; in Portuguese) program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a school-based cluster-randomized controlled trial that included students from six&#xD;
      elementary full-time public schools (7-9 grades) in Fortaleza, northeastern Brazil. The&#xD;
      intervention duration was one academic semester (approximately four months) in 2014. The&#xD;
      intervention strategies focused on teachers' training and activities on health in curriculum&#xD;
      (including a specific training to Physical Education teachers), active opportunities in the&#xD;
      school environment (availability of spaces and materials for PA) and health education&#xD;
      (production and exhibition of health material at school, and distributing pamphlets to&#xD;
      patients). Data collection will be performed before and immediately after 4 months of&#xD;
      intervention. The primary variables include the practice of PA (weekly PA volume) and the&#xD;
      screen time use (TV/computer/video games). Intrapersonal, interpersonal and environmental&#xD;
      variables associated to PA and screen time use will be evaluated by standardized&#xD;
      questionnaire. Other components of the lifestyle (e.g., eating habits), psychological (e.g.,&#xD;
      self-rated health, body satisfaction), biological (general and abdominal obesity) and&#xD;
      academic performance will be also evaluated in the patients. Depressive symptoms, eating&#xD;
      disorders, sleep quality, objectively-measured physical activity will be evaluated in obese&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is effective, this program will contribute to the development of public policies for active&#xD;
      and health lifestyle promotion among young population, especially from low- and middle-income&#xD;
      countries. The main variables (intrapersonal, interpersonal and/or environmental stimulus)&#xD;
      that help the young people to adopt an active lifestyle also may be indicated. Finally,&#xD;
      investigators expect that the proposed strategies may be adaptable to the public school&#xD;
      reality and they may be extended to the entire school system.&#xD;

      Setting and Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fortaleza is the capital of Ceara state, northeastern Brazil, and has a population of&#xD;
      2,452,185 inhabitants (the fifth largest city in Brazil considering the population). This&#xD;
      municipality has an area of 314 km² and a Human Development Index (HDI) of 0.754. The city of&#xD;
      Fortaleza is geographically divided into six administrative regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the Municipal Education Department, forty schools attended 6-9 grades and&#xD;
      included the Programa Saúde na Escola, and six out of these schools had a full-time education&#xD;
      model. These six schools attended approximately 2,500 students, of which 1,272 were enrolled&#xD;
      in classes from 7th to 9th grades.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These six schools had similar characteristics (e.g., size, target audience, curriculum, etc.)&#xD;
      and were located in different administrative regions (geographically disperses). Therefore,&#xD;
      there was no need to conduct peer schools during random selection to prevent study&#xD;
      contamination. Three schools were randomly selected to intervention group and other schools&#xD;
      were control group. The neighborhood-HDI from where the six schools were located was similar&#xD;
      between groups (neighborhood-HDI of 0.215, 0.341 and 0.443 for intervention schools, and&#xD;
      0.170, 0.377 and 0.491 for control schools).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Theoretical basis of the &quot;Fortaleça sua Saúde&quot; program:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;Fortaleça sua Saúde&quot; program was structured considering different theoretical aspects.&#xD;
      The Socioecological Theory emphasizes that intrapersonal (e.g., knowledge, self-efficacy),&#xD;
      interpersonal (social support, peer and family model) and environmental (perception and&#xD;
      environmental characteristics) aspects interfere independently and interactively in the&#xD;
      individual's behavior. The actions of the program &quot;Fortaleça sua Saúde&quot; program were directed&#xD;
      to achieve these different levels. The concepts of the Health Promoting in Schools was also&#xD;
      used. Three characteristics were used in order to choice the program components: Health&#xD;
      education topics in the formal school curriculum, health values, attitudes and opportunities&#xD;
      promoted within the school, and schools seek to engage with families, outside agencies and&#xD;
      the wider community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;Fortaleça sua Saúde&quot; intervention during the second scholar semester (approximately four&#xD;
      months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training and activities in general curriculum:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All teachers from three intervention schools were invited to participate of training and to&#xD;
      execute class activities focused on the discussion of active and healthy lifestyle. Full&#xD;
      training was structured in three stages (two face-stages and one distance-stage) with&#xD;
      certification recognized by the University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A four-hour training were performed at the beginning of school semester. Discussions on&#xD;
      primary health concepts and the importance of these issues were made, including the&#xD;
      relationship between health, school and academic performance. Proposals for cross-cutting&#xD;
      issues including the National Curriculum Standards were also discussed. Finally, strategies&#xD;
      directed to combine teaching tools (e.g., homework, tests presentations) and health issues&#xD;
      (e.g., physical activity [PA], quality of life, health eating) were discussed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Teachers received a supplemental manual in order to help the classroom activities. This&#xD;
      manual was prepared by program staff based on other productions on health in school, but they&#xD;
      were adapted to the reality of Fortaleza's schools and students. Brazilian documents on&#xD;
      education were consulted including the Learning Expectations of the Municipal Education&#xD;
      Department and the National Curriculum Standards on health topics. Ministerial reports on&#xD;
      health and education were also consulted. The manual included proposals for activities&#xD;
      according to knowledge areas (i.e., languages, social sciences, natural sciences and&#xD;
      mathematics). For example, in mathematics, an included proposal was about teaching&#xD;
      &quot;quantities and measures&quot; using body measures, PA energy expenditure energy consumption in&#xD;
      meals. Each proposal included description, required material, alternative, observations and&#xD;
      supporting texts. Teachers who could not attend the training also had access to the manual&#xD;
      and could participate in other stages of formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Teachers were encouraged to make the activities during the semester that were discussed&#xD;
      during training, or create and implement similar strategies in the classroom. In general, the&#xD;
      activities performed in the classroom included text production, videos/posters/booklets&#xD;
      production and exposition with health issues content. The issues content in the manual could&#xD;
      be suitable for the interests and expertise of teachers and patients (students) as well as&#xD;
      the structural conditions of each school. A social page was created in order to monitor,&#xD;
      assist and promote activities among teachers from the intervention schools. Finally, a&#xD;
      meeting with the teachers of each school was made at the end of the semester to discuss the&#xD;
      implementation of these activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training and activities in Physical Education classes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators conducted a four-hour training specified to the Physical Education teachers at&#xD;
      the beginning of school semester. Theachers were instructed to structure the predominantly&#xD;
      active Physical Education classes, even in classes with theoretical content purposes. For&#xD;
      example, a class focused on PA types and the relation between PA and healthy diet would be&#xD;
      structured with a dynamic way. Investigators considered this because the active time in&#xD;
      Physical Education classes can be a beneficial factor to total PA and adolescent health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A supplemental manual with lesson plans and handouts was also developed and distributed to&#xD;
      teachers. This manual was built for the program staffs and was organized by grades (7-9&#xD;
      grades). Materials from the Educação Física+ Project, Physical Education-specific National&#xD;
      Curriculum Standards and health issues were used to create the manual. The manual included&#xD;
      four units with different chapters: (i) PA and health (e.g., PA and leisure, cooperative&#xD;
      games, PA with parents); (ii) health factors (e.g., excessive sedentary time, diabetes,&#xD;
      hypertension, quality of life); (iii) sports (e.g., athletics, volleyball, functional&#xD;
      training, fights); and (iv) popular games (e.g., games and dance, adventure sports). The&#xD;
      production of posters and texts by the patient (students) with health issues content was&#xD;
      performed as classwork or homework.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Physical Education classes (20 classrooms with two Physical Education classes per week)&#xD;
      during the semester were supported by a undergraduate Physical Education student. This staff&#xD;
      collaborated in the planning of activities, material procurement organization and&#xD;
      implementation of lessons. Additionally, one Physical Education-related event (e.g., dance&#xD;
      festival or games competitions) were organized in order to combine Physical Education classes&#xD;
      and school cultural events (e.g., student's week) and to encourage the active participation&#xD;
      during school events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active opportunities in school environment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      These intervention strategies aimed to promote PA opportunities within the school and&#xD;
      stimulate it in out-school time, as well as disseminate information on the importance of an&#xD;
      active and healthy lifestyle. Supervised and unsupervised activity were considered. Some of&#xD;
      these strategies were focus on the engagement of girls - a high-risk subgroup for inactive&#xD;
      lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these strategies were implemented at the beginning of the program. Staffs, implemented&#xD;
      these strategies in the first two weeks of semester in order to guide the execution, material&#xD;
      access and understanding of the rules of the games. During the semester, some Physical&#xD;
      Education classes and &quot;Gym in School&quot; sessions were performed using these games in order to&#xD;
      stimulate its realization during free-time at school. Explanatory banners were exposed in&#xD;
      schools with content on the games rules and material access. Motivational (e.g., &quot;Let's play&#xD;
      with the friends!&quot;) and health (e.g., &quot;Practice PA with friends is very good for health!&quot;)&#xD;
      messages were also included in the banners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health education in school community:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of the previous strategies had an additional focus on promoting awareness about the&#xD;
      benefits of an active and healthy lifestyle. Principally, the materials produced in the&#xD;
      classroom in general and Physical Education classes and the banners exposed in schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, pamphlets with messages on active and healthy lifestyle were distributed at&#xD;
      intervention schools. The program team made these pamphlets and they based on other materials&#xD;
      programs. The content was adapted to the program objectives and local reality. Teachers and&#xD;
      professionals specialized in health education to young people made the content selection.&#xD;
      After this, marketing experts of the Municipal Education Department executed the graphical&#xD;
      structure of the pamphlets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pamphlets were delivered in the first month to a member of the school administration&#xD;
      (coordinator or director). Guidelines were passed on the objectives of the pamphlets and as&#xD;
      they could be distributed. In general, the pamphlets focused on the patients (students were&#xD;
      delivered during the early times of the school day or during classes. The pamphlets focused&#xD;
      on parents were delivered during parents/teachers meetings or in parent visits to school.&#xD;
      Teachers were encouraged to use the pamphlets during lessons with health messages.&#xD;
