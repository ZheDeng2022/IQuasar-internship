      This study looks at whether a coping skills training program can help women manage pain and&#xD;
      stress after breast surgery, and lower the risk of developing chronic pain. This coping&#xD;
      skills program includes eight training sessions that are done by telephone. These sessions&#xD;
      will focus on strategies for dealing with pain and stress, and how to apply these strategies&#xD;
      to subjects' own experiences.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Persistent pain following breast cancer surgery is increasingly being recognized as an&#xD;
      important clinical and public health issue due to the large numbers of women affected, the&#xD;
      negative impact that persistent pain has on emotional and physical functioning, and its&#xD;
      financial cost. Most of the 230,000 women that are expected to be newly diagnosed with breast&#xD;
      cancer in the U.S. this year will undergo surgical treatment. Surgical removal of the&#xD;
      affected breast (mastectomy) or excision of the tumor (lumpectomy) followed by radiation&#xD;
      markedly reduces the risk of disease progression and mortality. However, women undergoing&#xD;
      even the more limited lumpectomy are at substantial risk for persistent pain. Estimates of&#xD;
      pain's prevalence range from 25-60% across multiple studies, with rates differing based on&#xD;
      the stringency of the definition of persistent pain. In one recent study, 32.5% of the women&#xD;
      who had undergone breast cancer surgery reported clinically significant persistent pain,&#xD;
      defined as a 3/10-pain severity rating for the breast, axilla, side, or arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike acute post-operative pain, which is considered to be a normal response to surgical&#xD;
      trauma, persistent pain has little biological utility and has proven difficult to treat once&#xD;
      established. A critical question is whether there are modifiable factors that contribute to&#xD;
      the risk of developing persistent pain following breast cancer surgery that could be targeted&#xD;
      for early, preventative intervention. To date, attempts to reduce the risk of persistent pain&#xD;
      have focused on alterations in medical/surgical procedures; these studies have had mixed&#xD;
      results, consistent with mixed findings in the broader literature regarding the status of&#xD;
      medical/surgical variables as risk factors for persistent pain. In contrast, there have been&#xD;
      multiple studies showing associations between pain catastrophizing, depression, and anxiety&#xD;
      and persistent pain. In these studies, pain catastrophizing shows the strongest and most&#xD;
      consistent relationship to persistent pain as evidenced in a recent meta-analysis. Consistent&#xD;
      with the biopsychosocial theory of pain, there is also evidence from quantitative sensory&#xD;
      testing (QST) studies that alterations in central pain modulation pathways contribute to the&#xD;
      development of post-surgical persistent pain, including recent studies with breast cancer&#xD;
      patients. Since pain catastrophizing has been found to be associated with pernicious&#xD;
      alterations in central pain modulation intervening to reduce catastrophizing may be a&#xD;
      particularly effective prevention strategy for persistent pain following breast cancer&#xD;
      surgery. Pain coping skills training (PCST) interventions based on cognitive-behavioral&#xD;
      principles are the only interventions demonstrated to reduce catastrophizing, alter central&#xD;
      modulation of pain and reduce chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching hypothesis for the proposed pilot study (N=60) is that a targeted PCST&#xD;
      protocol specifically designed for women at risk for persistent pain following breast cancer&#xD;
      surgery (pain score of 3 or greater [0-10 scale] during the first 9 months post-surgery) will&#xD;
      significantly reduce this devastating consequence of treatment compared to usual care with&#xD;
      printed education materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To use a pilot RCT (N=60) to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and engagement in&#xD;
      the targeted PCST protocol. Feasibility will be assessed by examining overall accrual,&#xD;
      attrition, and adherence to the study protocol, engagement will be assessed by the use of&#xD;
      intervention sessions and questionnaires (number completed), and acceptability will be&#xD;
      assessed with a standardized measure of satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To obtain an estimate of the effect size of the targeted PCST protocol for persistent&#xD;
      post-surgical pain in comparison to the usual care condition. Effect sizes for group&#xD;
      differences on pain burden, symptoms of anxiety and depression, breast cancer specific&#xD;
      distress, perceived stress, sleep, interference with daily activities, pain catastrophizing,&#xD;
      and hypothesized changes in peripheral sensitivity and central inhibition will also be&#xD;
      computed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study represents the next critical step in research examining persistent pain&#xD;
      after surgical treatment for breast cancer. The proposed study will provide the necessary&#xD;
      preliminary data for larger studies aimed at testing the targeted PCST intervention. This&#xD;
      study will also provide preliminary data for future studies focused on pain sensitivity and&#xD;
      central pain modulation in breast cancer survivors&#xD;
