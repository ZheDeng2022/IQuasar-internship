  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single oromucosal&#xD;
      dose of Sativex in subjects with advanced cancer currently on background Step III opioid&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multiple-centre, single dose clinical trial to assess the PK of a&#xD;
      single oromucosal dose of Sativex in subjects with advanced cancer who are currently on&#xD;
      background Step III opioid therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 25 subjects ≥18 years with advanced cancer will be needed for the assessment of&#xD;
      the primary objective of the trial. The Screening Visit (Visit 1) will be performed within&#xD;
      -10 to -2 days prior to dosing. For the Screening Visit, subjects will attend on an&#xD;
      outpatient basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be checked into the clinical research facility on Day -1 and will be confined&#xD;
      to the clinical research facility for the Inpatient/Treatment Period (Day -1 to Day 3) (Visit&#xD;
      2). Subjects will be administered a single oromucosal dose of Sativex on Day 1 (time [t]=0).&#xD;
      Fourteen PK blood samples will be taken from Day 1 to Day 3 during Visit 2: one predose&#xD;
      sample and 13 postdose samples at the following time points after dosing: 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1,&#xD;
      1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours postdose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be discharged from the clinical research facility after the 48-hour PK blood&#xD;
      sample has been taken and final safety assessments are completed. Subjects who discontinue&#xD;
      from the trial prior to the completion of the PK blood draws will undergo the safety&#xD;
      evaluations scheduled for Day 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Safety Follow-up Call (Visit 3) will be made 7 (+2) days after dosing on Day 1. Subjects&#xD;
      with any new adverse events (AEs) or clinical laboratory abnormalities will be asked to&#xD;
      return for safety follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected duration for trial participation (including Screening Visit, Inpatient/Treatment&#xD;
      Period, and Safety Follow-up Call) for each individual subject is a maximum of 19 days.&#xD;

    <description>Sativex will be administered by trained, clinical trial personnel, via a pump action oromucosal spray. Sativex will be administered as 2 actuations (sprays) under the tongue or inside the cheeks every 4 minutes until 6 sprays have been administered. Following the administration of the first and second set of 2 actuations, patients will be offered 50 mL water to drink; and following the final set of 2 actuations, 100 mL of water will be offered (i.e., a total of 200 mL water will be offered during the Sativex dosing). There must be a period of at least 2 minutes and no more than 3 minutes between Sativex administration and consumption of water. Patients will not be permitted their regular medication until 2 hours post dose of investigational medicinal product (IMP) to minimize any possible drug interactions.</description>
