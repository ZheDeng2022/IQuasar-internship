  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 150 active duty service members meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual&#xD;
      version 5 (DSM-5) criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and scoring 50 or above&#xD;
      on the Clinician Administered PTSD Score for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) will be recruited. Qualifying&#xD;
      participants will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to either the eye movement desensitization&#xD;
      reprocessing (EMDR) plus venlafaxine XR group or the EMDR plus placebo group. Protocol will&#xD;
      call for participants to complete 12 one-hour EMDR session while taking a venlafaxine&#xD;
      XR/placebo dose of 150mg or 225mg for the entire 24 weeks. Both prescribers and therapists&#xD;
      will be blinded and CAPS-5 assessments will be completed by an individual not involved in a&#xD;
      participant's direct treatment. An unblinded pharmacist will dispense medication or placebo&#xD;
      according the instructions of the prescriber and will count remaining tablets to measure&#xD;
      compliance. All EMDR sessions will be recorded and will be reviewed by the principal&#xD;
      investigator using a fidelity checklist. CAPS-5 will be administered after completion of EMDR&#xD;
      and again at 6 months from the date of his/her first therapy session.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Approximately 150 active duty service members meeting DSM-5 criteria for PTSD and scoring 50&#xD;
      or above on the Clinician Administered PTSD Score for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) will be recruited for a&#xD;
      prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial. Participants will be recruited via&#xD;
      referral from other providers or self-referral from recruitment fliers. CAPS-5 is considered&#xD;
      the gold-standard for PTSD symptom assessment in research. An initial PHQ-9,PCL-5, urine drug&#xD;
      screen, and pregnancy test will be obtained at that visit as well. Qualifying participants&#xD;
      will then meet with a prescriber, review informed consent, draw a number for randomization,&#xD;
      and complete the SCID-5. The participant will then meet with the pharmacist who will dispense&#xD;
      either venlafaxine XR or placebo. Randomization will have occurred before any participants&#xD;
      have been recruited. Randomization will consist of use of a random number generator to&#xD;
      generate 150 numbers. The pharmacist will secretly assign half of the numbers to treatment&#xD;
      and half to control. Numbers generated will be written on slips of paper and placed in opaque&#xD;
      envelopes then placed in a box. Participants will then draw their own numbers and inform the&#xD;
      researchers of the number drawn. The titration schedule for the venlafaxine XR/placebo will&#xD;
      be 3 days at 37.5mg, 7 days at 75mg, then increasing to 150mg. The participant will meet with&#xD;
      the prescriber after 4 weeks at 150mg to determine if an increase to 225mg is warranted based&#xD;
      on the participants DSM-5 PTSD symptoms. Meetings with a prescriber will then occur monthly&#xD;
      throughout the study unless side effects or other concerns require more frequent follow up.&#xD;
      Prescriber visits will be scheduled for 30 minutes, however, visits could be completed in as&#xD;
      little as five minutes if the medication is working well with no side effects, blood pressure&#xD;
      remains at baseline, the participant remains adherent to both medication and therapy, and the&#xD;
      participant raises no concerns. Participants will meet with the pharmacist on a monthly basis&#xD;
      for pill counts. EMDR sessions will occur weekly if possible and not any less than once every&#xD;
      2 weeks. Two sessions are allowed in 1 week if the participant anticipates going to the field&#xD;
      or otherwise being unavailable for regular visits. All EMDR sessions will be recorded using a&#xD;
      camcorder and the principal investigator will review 10% of all therapy sessions (a minimum&#xD;
      of 1 session per participant) using a fidelity checklist. CAPS-5 assessments will be&#xD;
      completed by an individual not involved in a participant's direct treatment and will be&#xD;
      administered after completion of EMDR and again at 6 months from the date of his/her first&#xD;
      therapy session. A urine drug screen will be ordered with each CAPS-5. Missing&#xD;
      data/participant drop out will be handled using last object carried forward. Comparisons&#xD;
      between interventions will be computed using a student's T-test for single comparisons&#xD;
      between groups or ANOVA when multiple comparisons/time points are involved. If at any point a&#xD;
      participant requests a record of treatment, a summary of care will be provided.&#xD;
