  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuous interscalene brachial plexus block consists of inserting a catheter directly&#xD;
      within the brachial plexus in the interscalene groove, between the middle and anterior&#xD;
      scalene muscles, which is then infused with local anesthetic. This technique provides potent&#xD;
      and site-specific analgesia for several days after major shoulder surgery, along with&#xD;
      increased shoulder range of motion. A major side-effect of this procedure is the paralysis of&#xD;
      the ipsilateral diaphragm, which is the main muscle of the respiration. This paralysis occurs&#xD;
      at a rate of 90 to 100%, and is due to the spread of the local anesthetic towards the phrenic&#xD;
      nerve, lying anteriorly to the plexus, between the sternocleidomastoid and anterior scalene&#xD;
      muscles. Therefore, many patients suffering from respiratory syndromes, such as chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease, will not have a continuous interscalene brachial plexus block,&#xD;
      thus forfeiting some, or all, of the aforementioned benefits associated regional anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is conventionally taught to place the needle tip between the nerve roots of the brachial&#xD;
      plexus to obtain an effective block (intra-plexic injection). Recently, we have published a&#xD;
      new technique of single-shot injection for interscalene brachial plexus block where the&#xD;
      needle tip was positioned at a distance of 4 mm of the lateral part of the brachial plexus&#xD;
      (extra-plexic injection) and resulted in a reduction rate of 70% of hemidiaphragmatic paresis&#xD;
      and a preservation of spirometric values, while providing similar analgesia, when compared to&#xD;
      a conventional injection. Contrary to single-shot injections where high volume and high&#xD;
      concentration of local anesthetics are injected (eg, ropivacaine 0.5%, 20 mLs), continuous&#xD;
      blocks required low volume and low concentration (eg, ropivacaine 0.1-2%, 2-6 mLs/h) and&#xD;
      therefore the aforementioned concept of extra-plexic technique might not be suitable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, new catheter-over-the needle (Contiplex® C; B. Braun Melsungen AG, Germany) have&#xD;
      been released on the market and allows the physician to place the catheter tip exactly where&#xD;
      he desires, contrary to the previous generations where the catheters were inserted blindly,&#xD;
      despite the use of ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first objective of that randomised controlled trial is to demonstrate that an&#xD;
      extra-plexus catheter placement produces less respiratory complications than an intra-plexus&#xD;
      catheter placement. The second objective is to confirm that both techniques provide similar&#xD;
      analgesia.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients will be brought to the block room theatre. Before nerve blockade, standard&#xD;
      monitoring including non-invasive blood pressure, electrocardiogram, and pulse oximetry will&#xD;
      be applied and IV access established. Sedation and anxiolysis will be achieved with IV&#xD;
      midazolam (incremental doses of 1 mg) and IV fentanyl (incremental doses of 25 µg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous interscalene brachial plexus block will be performed with the patient lying&#xD;
      lateral on the non-operative side. The ultrasound probe will be placed in the interscalene&#xD;
      region to visualize the carotid artery and brachial plexus in the transverse sectional view&#xD;
      as is routine in our institution. The C5-C6-C7 roots will be identified following the&#xD;
      description of Martinolo et al. After sterilization and injection of local anesthetic (1-2%&#xD;
      lidocaine) into the skin, a catheter-over-the-needle (Contiplex® C; B. Braun Melsungen AG,&#xD;
      Germany) will be placed on the lateral side of the probe and advanced along the long axis of&#xD;
      the probe in the same plane as the ultrasound beam. For patients in the intra-plexus group,&#xD;
      the catheter tip will be positioned beyond the sheath, between C5 and C6 roots. In the&#xD;
      extra-plexus group, the catheter tip will be positioned 2 mm away from the lateral sheath of&#xD;
      the brachial plexus. After the injection of dose-test to exclude an intravascular placement,&#xD;
      twenty milliliters of local anesthetic containing ropivacaine 0.5% will be injected over 3-5&#xD;
      min under ultrasound visualization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative and postoperative procedure After application of routine monitors in the&#xD;
      operating theatre, patients will receive a standard general anesthetic. Anesthesia will be&#xD;
      induced using fentanyl 1-2 µg/kg IV and propofol 2-4 mg/kg IV with endotracheal intubation&#xD;
      facilitated by rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg IV. Maintenance of anesthesia will be ensured via inhaled&#xD;
      sevoflurane 1.6-2.5% in a 40:60 mixture of oxygen and air. Positive pressure ventilation will&#xD;
      be initiated with tidal volume and rate adjusted to maintain an end-tidal PCO2 of 30-40 mmHg.&#xD;
      Fentanyl will be administered as needed to treat increases in blood pressure and/or heart&#xD;
      rate of more than 15% above pre-induction baseline values. Prophylaxis of postoperative of&#xD;
      nausea and vomiting will be performed with dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg after the induction,&#xD;
      droperidol 1 mg and ondansetron 4 mg at the end of the surgery, as per routine practice in&#xD;
      our institution. Muscle relaxation will be antagonized with neostigmine 50 µg/kg and&#xD;
      glycopyrrolate 5-10 µg/kg routinely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During postoperative recovery in hospital, pain (Numeric rating scale [NRS] ≥ 4 or patient&#xD;
      request for analgesia) will be treated with morphine 2 mg every 10 min as needed, and the&#xD;
      ropivacaine 0.2% infusion will be set at a rate of 2 ml/h with bolus of 4 ml available every&#xD;
      30 minutes, as per our routine institutional practice. Once oral intake will be initiated,&#xD;
      patients will receive acetaminophen 1000 mg PO every 6 h and breakthrough oxycodone 5 mg per&#xD;
      os (PO) as needed, max 8 times. On the ward, infusion rate of ropivacaine will be increased&#xD;
      to 4 ml/h and then 6 ml/h in case of pain scores ≥ 4. The catheter will be removed on the&#xD;
      morning of postoperative day 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On postoperative day 1, 2, 3, and 4 a blinded research assistant will visit patients and&#xD;
      record data. Patients will also be contacted on postoperative day 30 to capture any&#xD;
      block-related complications such as persistent paresthesia, weakness, bruising, or&#xD;
      non-surgical pain in the operative extremity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these managements represent the current standard of care at Centre Hospitalier&#xD;
      Universitaire Vaudois.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of respiratory outcomes Diaphragmatic movement will be assessed by real-time&#xD;
      M-mode ultrasonography on each side using a curvilinear 2 - 5 MHz US probe, following&#xD;
      previous published descriptions. Patients will be examined in the lying position and scanned&#xD;
      from a low intercostal or subcostal approach using the liver or spleen as an acoustic window.&#xD;
      The range of diaphragmatic movement from the resting expiratory position (functional residual&#xD;
      capacity) to deep and quiet inspiration (sigh test) will be recorded as will the range of&#xD;
      diaphragmatic movement from resting expiratory position when quickly inspirating through the&#xD;
      nose (sniff test). The movement of the diaphragm will be measured in centimeters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  diaphragmatic movement reduction of more than 75%, no movement, or paradoxical movement&#xD;
           will be considered to be &quot; complete paresis &quot; ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  diaphragmatic movement reduction of both sigh and sniff test between 25% and 75% will be&#xD;
           considered to be &quot; partial paresis &quot; ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  diaphragmatic movement of less than 25% will be considered to be &quot; no paresis &quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal caudad movement will be designated as positive, whereas paradoxical cephalad movement&#xD;
      will be designated as negative. Each test will performed 3 times, and values will be&#xD;
      averaged. All measurements will be performed before the surgery (baseline), after the surgery&#xD;
      in phase 1 recovery (postanesthetic care unit) and on postoperative day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A bedside spirometer (EasyOneTM Spirometer; ndd Medical Technologies, Andover, UK) will be&#xD;
      used to assess ventilatory function (pulmonary function tests). After instructions, the full&#xD;
      vital capacity (VC) in lying and sitting upright positions will be measured. Other&#xD;
      measurements performed in patients in upright sitting position will be forced expiratory&#xD;
      volume at 1 sec (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and peak expiratory flow (PEF); the&#xD;
      tests will be repeated 3 times. The best value will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All measurements will be performed before the surgery (baseline), after the surgery in phase&#xD;
      1 recovery (postanesthetic care unit) and on postoperative day 1, 2, 3 and 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The percent fall of vital capacity from sitting to supine position will be considered as an&#xD;
      index of diaphragmatic dysfunction.&#xD;
