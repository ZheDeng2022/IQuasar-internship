    <textblock>
      The cannabinoid delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the primary psychoactive component of&#xD;
      marijuana. THC is believed to be a significant factor in the addictive potential associated&#xD;
      with marijuana use. In addition, attenuated levels of endogenous endocannabinoids have been&#xD;
      found in alcohol-dependent individuals as compared to social drinkers, suggesting that&#xD;
      changes in the sensitivity of the endogenous endocannabinoid system play a role in the&#xD;
      transition from recreational drug use to substance use disorders. Thus, pharmacotherapies&#xD;
      that target the cannabinoid system may be effective strategies for reducing marijuana use and&#xD;
      dependence. Recent preclinical data demonstrate that the neurosteroid pregnenolone (PREG)&#xD;
      inhibits THC activation of cannabinoid receptors and decreases symptoms of marijuana&#xD;
      intoxication. In addition, other studies show that PREG inhibits drug-seeking behavior. This&#xD;
      pilot study will provide important preliminary data on the effect of an acute dose of PREG on&#xD;
      cue-related craving in individuals with cannabis use disorder.&#xD;

      Overview Thirty participants between the ages of 18 and 65 who meet DSM-V criteria for&#xD;
      current for cannabis use disorder will complete a study visit. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive either PREG (400 mg) (n=15) or placebo (PBO) (n=15). Two-hours after&#xD;
      medication administration, the participants will complete a cue reactivity session. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected prior to medication, post-medication and after the cue-reactivity&#xD;
      session. The blood samples will be assayed for endogenous PREG and endocannabinoid levels.&#xD;
      Subjective craving and mood data will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects Participants will be 30 men or women between the ages of 18 and 65 years who meet&#xD;
      DSM-V criteria for cannabis use disorder. Additional inclusion criteria include use of&#xD;
      acceptable methods of birth control if female and of childbearing potential, positive urine&#xD;
      drug screen for cannabinoids at screening, consent to random assignment, and ability to read&#xD;
      and provide informed consent. Exclusion criteria include women who are pregnant, nursing, or&#xD;
      plan to become pregnant during the course of the study; having a history of or current&#xD;
      psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, or eating disorder; posing a current suicidal or&#xD;
      homicidal risk; having evidence or history of serious medical disease; requiring concomitant&#xD;
      therapy with psychotropic medication; being currently dependent on other substances, with the&#xD;
      exception of nicotine; and patients who, in the investigator's opinion, would be unable to&#xD;
      comply with study procedures or assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recruitment. Subjects will be primarily recruited through media advertisements. The&#xD;
           investigators have an active recruitment network in place, and have been able to&#xD;
           consistently surpass recruitment goals even with concomitantly recruiting studies in&#xD;
           this population, averaging enrollment of 11 participants per month. As such, the&#xD;
           investigators do not anticipate any issues with successfully recruiting for this study&#xD;
           in the proposed timeframe.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Screening/Assessment. Individuals will be initially screened for eligibility over the&#xD;
           telephone by a trained research assistant. Major inclusion/exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
           assessed during the phone interview, and if an individual seems potentially eligible,&#xD;
           (s)he will be invited for an in-person interview with a member of the research team.&#xD;
           Prior to any study procedures being performed, the individual will sign an IRB-approved&#xD;
           informed consent form. A battery of standardized assessments will then be delivered&#xD;
           (described below). A general medical history and physical exam will also be performed to&#xD;
           ensure that the subject is eligible to participate. In the event that a patient is found&#xD;
           to be ineligible to participate in this research protocol, he or she will be given an&#xD;
           appropriate referral for further medical care or to an appropriate treatment program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Session Preparation. The test session will be conducted at the MUSC Research NEXUS.&#xD;
           Prior to leaving the assessment visit, participants will be instructed to avoid caffeine&#xD;
           and marijuana on the day of the study visit. Participants will also be instructed to&#xD;
           abstain from other drug (including alcohol) use for the three days prior to the study&#xD;
           visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study Visit. Participants will present to the Addiction Sciences Division at 12:00 on&#xD;
           the day of the study visit. Female participants will complete a urine pregnancy test. If&#xD;
           the results are negative, or if the participant is male, the subject will be&#xD;
           breathalyzed and will provide a urine sample, which will be tested for the presence of&#xD;
           cocaine, opiates, benzodiazepines, THC, and stimulants. If either test is positive for&#xD;
           alcohol or any drug with the exception of marijuana, the study visit will be&#xD;
           rescheduled. A saliva sample to test for drugs of abuse will also be collected. Nicotine&#xD;
           patches will be provided to cigarette smokers to avoid nicotine withdrawal. Participants&#xD;
           will be escorted to the MUSC Research NEXUS by study personnel. At 12:30, a blood sample&#xD;
           will be collected from each participant. Each participant will also be asked to rate&#xD;
           their craving and mood (described below). Medication will be administered to the&#xD;
           participants by NEXUS personnel. Each participant will remain in a private room for two&#xD;
           hours. At 2:30 a second blood sample will be collected from each participant and&#xD;
           subjective ratings will be obtained. After the blood draw, study personnel will provide&#xD;
           the participant with standardized cue-exposure instructions, stating that two sets of&#xD;
           items will be presented and audio will be played through headphones. Control cues will&#xD;
           be presented to each participant. Examples of these cues include a note pad, pencil,&#xD;
           marker, cotton swabs and teabags.Wood chips will be presented as an olfactory cue and an&#xD;
           auditory script will be played in which each participant will be asked to imagine a day&#xD;
           at the beach. A third blood sample will be drawn and the participant will be asked to&#xD;
           rate their craving and mood. Afterwards each participant will be presented with the&#xD;
           marijuana cues. Examples of these cues include, blunt wrap, rolling papers, pipes, a&#xD;
           pipe cleaner, small bag containing fake marijuana, an ashtray, a water bong and a fake&#xD;
           joint. A marijuana stick cigarette and/or marijuana scented oil will be burned presented&#xD;
           as an olfactory cue and each participant will listen to a script prompting recall of a&#xD;
           recent pleasant experience with marijuana. Dr. McRae-Clark has a Schedule I DEA license,&#xD;
           and has obtained marijuana for clinical trial use from NIDA. The investigators'&#xD;
           laboratory and others have used these procedures to evoke craving in marijuana-dependent&#xD;
           individuals [11, 12]. Blood samples and subjective ratings will be collected&#xD;
           immediately, 15 minutes, 30 minutes and 60 minutes after the start of the marijuana cue&#xD;
           session. After the final assessment each participant will be debriefed and compensated.&#xD;
           In the event that a participant's craving remains elevated, he or she will be asked to&#xD;
           remain in the NEXUS until their craving has subsided.&#xD;

        General Inclusion / Exclusion Criteria Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects must be able to provide informed consent and function at an intellectual&#xD;
             level sufficient to allow accurate completion of all assessment instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects must meet DSM-5 criteria for current cannabis use disorder (within the past&#xD;
             three months). While individuals may endorse use of other substances, they must&#xD;
             identify marijuana as their primary substance of abuse and must not meet criteria for&#xD;
             any other substance use disorder (except nicotine) within the last 60 days. Due to the&#xD;
             high comorbidity of marijuana and alcohol use disorder, subjects who meet criteria for&#xD;
             mild alcohol use disorder will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects must consent to remain abstinent from alcohol for 24 hours and other drugs of&#xD;
             abuse (except nicotine and marijuana) for three days immediately prior to the study&#xD;
             visit. Subjects must abstain from marijuana for 24 hours prior to the study visit. By&#xD;
             restricting marijuana use as proposed, subjects should not be under the acute effects&#xD;
             of marijuana.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects must consent to random assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Women who are pregnant, nursing or of childbearing potential and not practicing an&#xD;
             effective means of birth control.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Individuals taking exogenous gonadal steroids including estrogens, progestins and&#xD;
             testosterone. This includes hormonal contraception and replacement therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects with evidence of or a history of significant hematological, endocrine,&#xD;
             cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, gastrointestinal, neurological disease including&#xD;
             diabetes or cancer, as these conditions may affect study outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects with a history of or current psychotic disorder or bipolar affective disorder&#xD;
             as these may interfere with subjective measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects taking any psychotropic medications, including SRI's or other&#xD;
             antidepressants, opiates or opiate antagonists because these may affect test response.&#xD;
             Individuals who take stimulants for treatment of ADHD will be allowed to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects with any acute illness or fever. Individuals who otherwise meet study&#xD;
             criteria will be rescheduled for evaluation for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects who are unwilling or unable to maintain abstinence from alcohol and marijuana&#xD;
             for 24 hours and other drugs of abuse (except nicotine) for three days prior to the&#xD;
             study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects meeting DSM-5 criteria for a substance use disorder (other than nicotine,&#xD;
             marijuana, or alcohol) within the past 60 days.&#xD;
