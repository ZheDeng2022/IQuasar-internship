  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers are studying factors that may increase the risk for alcohol and drug use in&#xD;
      individuals who do not have any problems with these substances. This study will be looking at&#xD;
      health behaviors in young adults compared to their family's health behaviors and lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to study genetic differences in people with and without a family&#xD;
      history of alcoholism. The researchers hope to learn how a family history of alcoholism,&#xD;
      early life adversity and different genotypes shape personal characteristics associated with a&#xD;
      risk for alcoholism.&#xD;

      The Oklahoma Family Health Patterns project is an intensive study of psychological,&#xD;
      behavioral, and stress reactivity characteristics in healthy young adults with a family&#xD;
      history of alcoholism (FH+) with a goal of identifying characteristics that place these&#xD;
      persons at elevated risk for the disorder. The investigators have recently identified early&#xD;
      life adverse experience (ELA), including physical and sexual abuse and separation from&#xD;
      parents, as occurring with disproportionate impact in FH+, and the investigators have shown&#xD;
      that ELA accounts for diminished stress reactivity, behavioral impulsivity, and poor mood&#xD;
      regulation, all of which are risk factors for alcohol and other substance use disorders. The&#xD;
      impact of ELA in the FH+ population demands to be studied further in a Gene x Environment&#xD;
      interaction given the known positive feedbacks between FH+ and ELA. The investigators' goal&#xD;
      is to carry out a G x E interaction study by genotyping the investigators' FH x ELA and&#xD;
      examining the impact of genotype on the broad range of personal characteristics currently&#xD;
      under study in this project. Aim 1. Examine the differential impact of ELA on psychological&#xD;
      and behavioral characteristics of FH+ vs. FH- groups using an expanded sample of volunteers.&#xD;
      Aim 2. Use the investigators' larger sample to carry out a Gene x Environment analysis to&#xD;
      test specific alleles that are strongly suspected of influencing activity in brain&#xD;
      motivational systems, expanding on work the investigators initiated with NIAAA thanks to a&#xD;
      supplement to this R01 (AA012207-S1). Aim 3. Test specific aspects of temperament as&#xD;
      endophenotypes linking FH and ELA to behavioral, cognitive, and stress reactivity as aspects&#xD;
      of the person's phenotype. Aim 4. Increase the investigators' recruitment base by screening&#xD;
      and testing volunteers at a second site, the University of Texas HSC, San Antonio, where the&#xD;
      investigators currently conduct our neuroimaging studies. Alcoholism is a costly burden to&#xD;
      society, but risk factors for alcoholism are poorly understood. The vast majorities of&#xD;
      studies focuses on alcoholic patients but are unable to disentangle preexisting influences&#xD;
      from the effects of alcohol intake history. The investigators' high-risk study design can be&#xD;
      of value by contrasting FH+ and FH- with regard to environmental contributors and genetic&#xD;
      vulnerabilities that contribute to behavioral risk factors.&#xD;
