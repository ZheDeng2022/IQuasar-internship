      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Researchers want to learn if people with alcohol dependence have more difficulty learning&#xD;
      to feel calm, or learn to fear things more easily. They also want to study how early life&#xD;
      stress (ELS) affects the ability to learn to feel calm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if people with alcohol dependence and/or ELS have a harder time learning to feel&#xD;
      calm than people without these. Also, to see if DNA is changed by ELS and if this change&#xD;
      affects fear conditioning and extinction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults ages 21-65 with and without an alcohol use disorder (AUD) and with and without&#xD;
           ELS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Psychological tests&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Treatment for symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, if needed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers will have 1 overnight visit (2 days, 1 night). AUD participants will&#xD;
           stay at the clinic for about 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Rate alcohol use/craving, depression, anxiety, and childhood trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Have psychophysiological measures: electrodes and mild electric shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Participants will lie on a&#xD;
           table in a metal cylinder with a coil over their head. In the first scanning session,&#xD;
           they will see pictures, do a simple task, and may get shocks. Participants will also do&#xD;
           a second scanning session in which they will perform the aforementioned fear&#xD;
           conditioning and extinction task, as well as a facial expression matching task, an&#xD;
           affective word processing task, and a task measuring valuation of monetary rewards.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Answer questions about their emotions (some participants).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Have blood drawn from an arm vein or intravenous (IV) line.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  AUD participants will get a dexamethasone pill. The next day, they will get a&#xD;
                hormone injected in and have blood drawn from an IV line.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AUD participants will have 3 follow-up visits with questions and blood and lab tests.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the role and interaction of (epi)genetic&#xD;
      factors, early life stress (ELS) exposure, and alcohol use disorder (AUD) on neuronal&#xD;
      mechanisms of fear conditioning and extinction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central hypothesis is that participants with AUD and ELS will have disrupted fear&#xD;
      extinction, and in addition, those with ELS will also have disrupted fear extinction. AUD&#xD;
      with ELS will have the most severe disruption of fear extinction as observed clinically in&#xD;
      alcoholics with severe trauma - often presenting with the most severe phenotypes and being&#xD;
      most treatment resistant. A disruption in fear extinction or living in constant fear after&#xD;
      stress/trauma could thus put the individual at risk for AUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification and characterization of the neurobiological correlates underlying this&#xD;
      mechanism is thus essential and could provide new avenues for treatment of AUD; namely&#xD;
      developing interventions that normalize abnormal fear extinctions. These interventions could&#xD;
      be for example, cognitive-behavior based or molecular by targeting genetic/epigenetic&#xD;
      pathways potentially identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our proposal, if successful, will first establish a reliable measureable endophenotype of&#xD;
      fear extinction in AUD/ELS, both behaviorally (skin conductance response) and neuronal (using&#xD;
      an fMRI paradigm). Furthermore, we will carry out exploratory genetic and epigenetics studies&#xD;
      that might influence these measures. This model can then be used in follow up studies for&#xD;
      novel therapeutic interventions that could target treatment of these mechanisms in AUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study sample includes two patient groups and two control groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. treatment-seeking or non-treatment-seeking individuals with AUD and ELS exposure;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. treatment-seeking or non-treatment-seeking individuals with AUD without ELS exposure;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. healthy volunteers with ELS exposure;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. healthy volunteers without ELS exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target accrual for each of these groups is 25.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be evaluated for fear conditioning and extinction using shock conditioning&#xD;
      (extinction procedure combined with fMRI imaging that utilizes galvanic skin response). All&#xD;
      participants will undergo whole-genome methylome analyses to assess genome wide methylation&#xD;
      patterns. Genotyping of variants in candidate genes implicated in the biology of fear&#xD;
      conditioning/extinction will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of interest is fear extinction, measured by fMRI paradigms. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives include: (1) explore the role of genetic variants and epigenetic factors and their&#xD;
      impact on fear extinction in AUD and healthy controls with or without ELS; (2) explore&#xD;
      differences in reward processing and emotion processing, measured by fMRI as a function of&#xD;
      AUD, ELS, and (epi)genetic modulators; and (3) examine the relationship between fear&#xD;
      extinction and clinical outcomes in both AUD and ELS participants sample.&#xD;
