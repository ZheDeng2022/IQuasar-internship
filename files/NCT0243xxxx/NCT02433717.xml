      Background Paliperidone is an active metabolite of risperidone, both of which are&#xD;
      antipsychotic agents for treatment of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders.&#xD;
      Pharmacogenetic studies have revealed that the efficacy and side effects of antipsychotic&#xD;
      agents are related to polymorphisms of specific genes, however, there are just a few related&#xD;
      studies on paliperidone. The current study aims to evaluate whether pharmacogenetic markers&#xD;
      related to risperidone and genetic markers associated with schizophrenia have effects on the&#xD;
      clinical effectiveness of paliperidone treatment. The study also uses changes of&#xD;
      event-related potentials (ERP) as indices for clinical efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods It is a prospective, open-label, non-randomized and uncontrolled clinical trial to&#xD;
      study the efficacy and side effects of 6-week paliperidone ER treatment for patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The first three weeks of treatment has to be&#xD;
      inpatient treatment. In the first two weeks, participants will take 9 mg paliperidone ER&#xD;
      daily. Then the dose of paliperidone can be adjusted to within the range of 6-12 mg per day.&#xD;
      Efficacy indicators include symptom severity, global functioning, and ERP. Side effect&#xD;
      indicators include common side effect evaluate, extrapyramidal symptoms, metabolic profiles,&#xD;
      hormonal change, and bone metabolism indices. Participants will also receive examinations for&#xD;
      blood drug concentration, genetic polymorphisms, and epigenetic markers.&#xD;

      A. Background Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder whose pathophysiology is not yet&#xD;
      understood clearly. The treatment of schizophrenia remains suboptimal. Take risperidone for&#xD;
      example, response rate of a patient is around only 60% to 80%. The second-generation or&#xD;
      atypical antipsychotics are widely used. Apart from dopamine D2 receptor, they also target on&#xD;
      5-HT2 receptors and receptors of other neurotransmission systems. However, these&#xD;
      second-generation antipsychotics still result in other common side effects. Therefore,&#xD;
      finding predictors for clinical efficacy and side effect profile is a necessary task. Up to&#xD;
      date, several genetic and non-genetic factors have been suggested related to the efficacy and&#xD;
      side effects of antipsychotics. Noteworthy, pharmacokinetics as indicated by the temporal&#xD;
      change of antipsychotics blood levels is usually overlooked. It might be a contributing&#xD;
      factor why results from pharmacogenetic studies were usually difficult to be replicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paliperidone (9-hydroxy-risperidone) is an active metabolite of the second-generation&#xD;
      antipsychotics risperidone. Pharmacogenetic studies have found polymorphisms of some genes to&#xD;
      be related to blood risperidone concentration, side effects and treatment response. Comparing&#xD;
      to risperidone, paliperidone has less metabolic side effects, probable faster occurrence of&#xD;
      efficacy, and better tolerance for subjects with hepatic insufficiency. Further, paliperidone&#xD;
      is more sensitive to P-glycoprotein. There are just a few pharmacogenetic studies on&#xD;
      paliperidone and P-glycoprotein. Therefore, one aim of this proposed study is to examine the&#xD;
      pharmacogenetic effects on paliperidone extended release (paliperidone ER) for acute&#xD;
      treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. The electrophysiological&#xD;
      abnormalities as measured by event-related potentials (ERP) are characteristics features of&#xD;
      several neuropsychological disorders. For schizophrenia, deficits in mismatch negativity,&#xD;
      P50, and auditory steady state response have been frequently reported. Therefore, besides&#xD;
      from clinical improvements, the investigators are also interested whether paliperidone&#xD;
      treatment can alter the deficits in mismatch negativity, P50, and ASSR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Study aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To study the association of candidate genes, which are related to pharmacodynamics and&#xD;
           pharmacokinetics of risperidone, with paliperidone pharmacokinetics and clinical&#xD;
           response&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the impact of pharmacodynamics on the efficacy (including ERP change and&#xD;
           cognitive function) and side effects of paliperidone ER for acute treatment of&#xD;
           schizophrenia&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate whether the paliperidone pharmacodynamics is related to the metabolic,&#xD;
           hormonal, and bone turnover profiles&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate whether paliperidone ER treatment will influence epigenetic markers&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate whether paliperidone ER treatment will influence event-related potentials&#xD;
           and performance in neurocognitive tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Study design It is a 6-week, prospective, open-label, uncontrolled and non-randomized&#xD;
      trial of paliperidone ER for patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder in an&#xD;
      acute episode. A total of 40 subjects will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Protocol overview:&#xD;
&#xD;

      acute psychiatry ward (03W2) in National Taiwan University Hospital. Medication compliance,&#xD;
      efficacy of treatment and side effects will be monitored and evaluated by the psychiatrists&#xD;
      who are the principle investigator or sub-investigators of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Dosage of titration of paliperidone ER:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Fixed dose (9 mg/day) of paliperidone ER will be given in the first two weeks of trial&#xD;
           (from day 1 to day 14). Since the third week (day 15), the dosage can be adjusted in the&#xD;
           range of 6 to 12 mg per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Medication regulation:&#xD;
&#xD;

      E. Conditions when the trial will be stopped Since paliperidone ER has been approved for the&#xD;
      treatment of schizophrenia by the Food and Drug Administration and the daily dose is within&#xD;
      the recommended range, this trial will be terminated or suspended under the following&#xD;
      situations: (a) order from the Research Ethics Committee to terminate or suspend the clinical&#xD;
      trial; (b) order from the Central Competent Health Authority to terminate or suspend the&#xD;

      University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F. Trial medications Paliperidone Extended-Release Tablets (Invega): 9 mg/tab, 3 mg/tab&#xD;
&#xD;
      G. Data collection and statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the current study is an open-labeled and single-arm trial, it is not aimed to prove the&#xD;
      efficacy of paliperidone for treatment of schizophrenia. Instead, it is aimed to evaluate&#xD;
      whether pharmacodynamics factors are related to the clinical response of paliperidone&#xD;
      treatment. The variables of clinical response are defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary efficacy variable: response rate (the ratio of subjects who respond to&#xD;
           paliperidone treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Response to paliperidone treatment is calculated as [(PANSSevaluation - PANSSbaseline)/&#xD;
           (PANSSbaseline -30)]*100%&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary efficacy variables: PSP, CGI-S, ERPs and neurocognitive tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Side effect variables: DIEPSS, UKU side effect scales, body weight, blood chemistry&#xD;
           markers, metabolic markers, hormonal markers, and bone turnover markers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response rate and other efficacy variables were analyzed with last observation carried&#xD;
      forward and intention-to-treat principles. Response rate will be calculated on day 4, 7, 14,&#xD;
      28 and 42, and the impact of pharmacodynamics and genetic effects will be analyzed&#xD;
      accordingly. Demographic data, blood paliperidone concentration, and the aforementioned&#xD;
      variables will be compared between responder group and non-responder group on last visit&#xD;
      (Pearson χ2 test or Fisher exact test will be used to compare categorical variables;&#xD;
      independent t test will be used for continuous variables). The secondary efficacy and side&#xD;
      effect variables on day 0 (before treatment) and day 42 (after treatment) will be compared&#xD;
      with paired t-test. Relationship of the change of the aforementioned variables with blood&#xD;
      paliperidone concentration will be examined by Pearson's correlation coefficient test or&#xD;
      Spearman's correlation coefficient test. Multiple linear regression analysis will be applied&#xD;
      for adjustments of covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The genotyping quality will be checked by Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium tests. Association of&#xD;
      the allelic effects of the genetic markers with clinical response and other outcome variables&#xD;
      will be analyzed by using PLINK version 1.07 19. Other statistical analyses will be performed&#xD;
      by using SAS®9.4 Software (SAS Institute Inc., USA). A p-value of less than 0.05 was&#xD;
      considered statistically significant.&#xD;
