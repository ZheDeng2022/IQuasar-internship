      Donation after Cardiac Death (DCD) is an increasingly common mechanism through wish patients&#xD;
      can donate tissue and organs following death after withdrawal of life sustaining therapies&#xD;
      (WLST). Unfortunately many potential DCD donors are not ultimately able to donate and this is&#xD;
      a significant emotional and resource burden to families, healthcare workers and hospitals. A&#xD;
      tool that allows accurate prediction of time to death following WLST (and thus the&#xD;
      probability of successful donation) is urgently needed. Existing models have not been useful&#xD;
      due to the lack of generalizability. Additionally, existing models have not included other&#xD;
      important factors now recognized to be associated with time to death following WLST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a prospective, observational cohort study of all patients&#xD;
      being considered for DCD in whom consent for donation is obtained to evaluate the association&#xD;
      between neurologic and non-neurologic risk factors for apnea, other clinically important&#xD;
      variables and time to death after WLST, and use these data to derive a generalizable&#xD;
      predictive model for the prediction of the time to death following WLST in potential DCD&#xD;
      donors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Donation after cardiac death (DCD) is a method by which patients have the opportunity to&#xD;
      donate organs following elective withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies (WLST). Often these&#xD;
      patients have suffered a catastrophic neurological injury although not progressed to brain&#xD;
      death or have a severe medical condition for which ongoing medical care is considered&#xD;
      non-beneficial. DCD has become an increasingly significant source of organs for&#xD;
      transplantation in a time of growing wait lists and organ shortfall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to donate organs through DCD, the potential donor must progress to death within a&#xD;
      certain time window after withdrawal of life sustaining therapies. This timeframe varied but&#xD;
      is usually less than 120 minutes following WLST. Up to 40% of potentially eligible DCD donors&#xD;
      in Ontario do not proceed to organ procurement for these reasons (internal data from Trillium&#xD;
      Gift of Life).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The uncertainty and variability in the potential for successful organ procurement has an&#xD;
      impact on families, health care teams and organ retrieval teams. It is important that this&#xD;
      emotional and resource burden only occurs in candidates with a reasonable likelihood of being&#xD;
      eligible to donate organs. The amount of time elapsing between WLST and circulatory arrest&#xD;
      (and organ procurement) has important implications for the quality of the procured organs,&#xD;
      and some organs are unable to be transplanted after death. Finally, maintaining organ&#xD;
      procurement teams and an operating room on standby consumes valuable hospital resources and&#xD;
      removes these human and physical resources from other clinical duties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several different prediction tools have been proposed to predict time to death following WLST&#xD;
      in potential DCD donors, but none has been proven useful. To derive a more generalizable&#xD;
      prediction tool it is necessary to identify valid predictors that are common to a wide&#xD;
      variety of patients undergoing WLST. We propose the addition of features that predict apnea&#xD;
      or respiratory insufficiency in the development of a new predictive model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While previous studies propose important variables for prediction of time to death, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that features that are focused on apnea (neurologic and non-neurologic) will be&#xD;
      independently predictive of time of death following WLST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurological predictors of apnea: The previous studies have consistently identified one or&#xD;
      two neurologic risk factors for apnea associated with time to death. These risk factors have&#xD;
      been evaluated in isolation and have never been rigorously studied in a broader population or&#xD;
      in combination. We wish to evaluate the following neurological risk factors for apnea which&#xD;
      have been previously found to be associated with time to death in certain studies: Glasgow&#xD;
      Coma Scale, absence of brain stem reflexes (corneal, pupil, cough, gag), and controlled mode&#xD;
      of mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-Neurological predictors of apnea: No studies to date have evaluated features focused on&#xD;
      non-neurologic causes of apnea. Given that neurologic predictors of apnea have been the one&#xD;
      consistent feature that has been identified across most studies, we hypothesize that&#xD;
      evaluating additional predictors of apnea beyond neurologic causes could similarly have an&#xD;
      association with time to death as they both result in profound hypoxia. While some&#xD;
      researchers have evaluated the contribution of BMI and weight, we hypothesize that the&#xD;
      addition of more definitive features of upper airway obstruction will strengthen the&#xD;
      performance of our prediction tool. Neck circumference, absence of endotracheal tube cuff&#xD;
      leak, fluid balance, and history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are novel and could improve&#xD;
      the operating characteristics of prediction tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neck circumference has been found to be associated with airway obstruction and has been&#xD;
      incorporated into numerous prediction tools for OSA. In a study evaluating prevalence and&#xD;
      predictors of upper airway obstruction following stroke, neck circumference was independently&#xD;
      associated with any upper airway obstruction that occurred 24 hours following acute stroke.&#xD;
      In a pooled analysis, the absence of cuff leak has been shown to be predictive of post&#xD;
      extubation stridor with 92% specificity, thus suggesting impending loss of airway patency.&#xD;
      Fluid balance has also been found to be associated with post extubation failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct a prospective, observational cohort study of all patients being considered&#xD;
      for DCD in whom consent for donation is obtained to evaluate the association between&#xD;
      neurologic and non-neurologic risk factors for apnea, other clinically important variables&#xD;
      and time to death after WLST, and use these data to derive a generalizable predictive model&#xD;
      for the prediction of the time to death following WLST in potential DCD donors.&#xD;

        We will include all patients who are deemed eligible for DCD by Trillium Gift of Life&#xD;
        Network (TGLN) and in whom informed consent for DCD is obtained from the substitute&#xD;
        decision maker. All patients will be included in the study if they undergo withdrawal of&#xD;
        life sustaining therapy for the potential of donation (whether they successfully donate or&#xD;
        not). Any patient on mechanical ventilation who is 80 years of age or under is a potential&#xD;
        DCD candidate if there is a plan for elective WLST.&#xD;
