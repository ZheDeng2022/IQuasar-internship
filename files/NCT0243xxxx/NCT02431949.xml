      The perception of music requires coordinated neural activities in distributed&#xD;
      multi-functional centers across both hemispheres. The association between musical abilities&#xD;
      and other general cognitive functions have been studied in several populations with&#xD;
      inconsistent results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schizophrenia is a major mental disorder that is strongly associated with cognitive deficits.&#xD;
      These often appear before the onset of psychotic symptoms and persist throughout effective&#xD;
      treatment of positive and negative symptoms. Like other disorders of psychosis, schizophrenia&#xD;
      features general deficits in auditory memory and sensory processing. Recently, Sawada et al.&#xD;
      (2014) and Wen et al. (2014) studied music abilities in Japanese and Chinese schizophrenic&#xD;
      populations. They both used a standardized assessment for amusia called Montreal Battery of&#xD;
      Evaluation of Amusia (MBEA) and found marked impairments in perception of scale, contour,&#xD;
      interval, rhythm, meter and memory. Both studies showed that deficits in music perception&#xD;
      were associated with cognitive deficits and negative symptoms. In regards to positive&#xD;
      symptoms, Wen et al., but not Sawada et al., found a significant association.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present clinical study will assess musical abilities using the MBEA in a Canadian&#xD;
      population with and without refractory psychosis. It will explore associations between&#xD;
      musical deficits, positive and negative psychiatric symptomology and cognition. The patient&#xD;
      population will have a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, affective&#xD;
      disorder with psychosis or non substance-related psychosis who were referred to the British&#xD;
      Columbia Psychosis Program (BCPP) due to inadequate or no response to at least two trials of&#xD;
      antipsychotics. A focus on refractory psychosis may provide greater insights because these&#xD;
      patients have relatively more pronounced psychiatric symptoms and cognitive deficits. It will&#xD;
      also be valuable to administer the MBEA assessment on a Canadian population, because the test&#xD;
      was originally intended for Western populations and its musical phrases were designed with&#xD;
      Western tonalities.&#xD;

      1. BACKGROUND, PURPOSE AND JUSTIFICATION&#xD;
&#xD;
           The perception of music requires coordinated neural activities in distributed&#xD;
           multi-functional centers across both hemispheres. The association between musical&#xD;
           abilities and other general cognitive functions have been studied in several populations&#xD;
           with inconsistent results.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Schizophrenia is a major mental disorder that is strongly associated with cognitive&#xD;
           deficits. These often appear before the onset of psychotic symptoms and persist&#xD;
           throughout effective treatment of positive and negative symptoms. Like other disorders&#xD;
           of psychosis, schizophrenia features general deficits in auditory memory and sensory&#xD;
           processing. Recently, Sawada et al. (2014) and Wen et al. (2014) studied music abilities&#xD;
           in Japanese and Chinese schizophrenic populations. They both used a standardized&#xD;
           assessment for amusia called Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia (MBEA) and found&#xD;
           marked impairments in perception of scale, contour, interval, rhythm, meter and memory.&#xD;
           Both studies showed that deficits in music perception were associated with cognitive&#xD;
           deficits and negative symptoms. In regards to positive symptoms, Wen et al., but not&#xD;
           Sawada et al., found a significant association.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The present clinical study will assess musical abilities using the MBEA in a Canadian&#xD;
           population with and without refractory psychosis. It will explore associations between&#xD;
           musical deficits, positive and negative psychiatric symptomology and cognition. The&#xD;
           patient population will have a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder,&#xD;
           affective disorder with psychosis or non substance-related psychosis who were referred&#xD;
           to the British Columbia Psychosis Program (BCPP) due to inadequate or no response to at&#xD;
           least two trials of antipsychotics. A focus on refractory psychosis may provide greater&#xD;
           insights because these patients have relatively more pronounced psychiatric symptoms and&#xD;
           cognitive deficits. It will also be valuable to administer the MBEA assessment on a&#xD;
           Canadian population, because the test was originally intended for Western populations&#xD;
           and its musical phrases were designed with Western tonalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. RESEARCH OUTLINE This is a cross-sectional, observational study. Participating patients&#xD;
           with refractory psychosis and healthy (age- and gender- matched) controls will undergo&#xD;
           the Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia assessment and assessments of cognition and&#xD;
           symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to describe music perceptive ability in patients with refractory&#xD;
      psychosis using the Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia, a standardized and continuous&#xD;
      measure of musical ability. The criterion for amusia is a score of 2 standard deviations&#xD;
      below the mean of normal participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4) OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to compare music perceptive ability in patients with clinically&#xD;
      identified refractory psychosis with healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to compare the prevalence of amusia in a population of patients&#xD;
      with refractory psychosis versus a population of healthy controls, and to compare psychiatric&#xD;
      symptoms and cognition in patients with amusia versus patients without amusia. We will also&#xD;
      determine if an association exists between music perceptive ability and:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General and specific aspects of symptom severity, as assessed by standardized symptom&#xD;
           rating scales and neurological status examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General and specific aspects of cognition, as assessed by cognitive tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic variables such as sex, age, musical training and education. In addition, we&#xD;
           will investigate potential pathways between symptomologies of psychosis, cognitive&#xD;
           deficits and musical disability (if found) by using exploratory mediation analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5) RESEARCH METHOD We will recruit 100 participants, who will undergo the Montreal&#xD;
           Battery of Evaluation of Amusia test and cognitive tests. Of these, 50 will be age- and&#xD;
           gender- matched participants not diagnosed with a psychosis disorder who will serve as&#xD;
           controls. The remaining 50 participants will be recruited from BCPP at UBC Hospital for&#xD;
           in-patients diagnosed with refractory psychosis. For patients, participation will also&#xD;
           involve assessments of their mental health (psychiatric symptoms).&#xD;
&#xD;
           6) STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Inferential analyses will be used to assess differences in&#xD;
           musical ability between patients and controls. It will also be used to evaluate&#xD;
           differences in psychiatric symptoms and cognition between patients with amusia and those&#xD;
           without amusia. Linear regression analyses will be done to relate psychiatric symptoms&#xD;
           and cognition to musical ability. Mediation analyses will be performed to determine a&#xD;
           causal model between symptoms, cognition and musical ability.&#xD;
