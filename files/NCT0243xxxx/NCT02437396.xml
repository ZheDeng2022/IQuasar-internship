  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate oxidative stress and/or inflammation in patients&#xD;
      with Gaucher disease type I using a series of biomarkers and correlate with measurements of&#xD;
      currently used diagnostic biomarkers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will determine oxidative stress and/or inflammation related biomarkers in whole blood&#xD;
      and/or plasma in adult subjects with Gaucher disease. Fifteen milliliter blood sample will be&#xD;
      collected during three independent visits over a period of approximately 3 months. These&#xD;
      samples will be processed to separate plasma from red blood cells and frozen until assays are&#xD;
      performed. Standardized immunoassay methods and LC/MS based methods will be adopted to assay&#xD;
      a series of biomarkers in these samples. These data will be correlated with currently used&#xD;
      diagnostic biomarkers.&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. All participants must be 18 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. All enrollees must understand and cooperate with requirements of the study in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigators and must be able to provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Individuals with Gaucher disease who are medically stable for participation in study&#xD;
             in the opinion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. GD subjects must be stable on a specific ERT and/or SRT therapy at a specific dose&#xD;
             (for e.g. on a units/kg basis) for at least 2 years or be na√Øve to these therapies (no&#xD;
             therapy for 2 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. GD1 patients, who have had a change in therapy i.e. a change in dose or switch from&#xD;
             one drug to another, can be enrolled after at least 6 months have elapsed since the&#xD;
             change and is considered stable in the opinion of the clinician providing care to the&#xD;
             patient.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Concurrent disease; medical condition; or an extenuating circumstance that, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator, might compromise subject safety, study compliance,&#xD;
             completion of the study, or the integrity of the data collected for the study.&#xD;
