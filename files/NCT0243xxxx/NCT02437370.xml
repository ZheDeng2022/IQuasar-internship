      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of pembrolizumab when given&#xD;
      together with docetaxel or gemcitabine hydrochloride in treating patients with previously&#xD;
      treated urothelial cancer that has spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be&#xD;
      cured or controlled with treatment (advanced) or that has spread from the primary site (place&#xD;
      where it started) to other places in the body (metastatic). Monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Drugs&#xD;
      used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel and gemcitabine hydrochloride, work in different ways&#xD;
      to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving pembrolizumab together with docetaxel or&#xD;
      gemcitabine hydrochloride may be a better treatment for urothelial cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) when given in&#xD;
      combination with docetaxel or gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride) in patients with&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic platinum-treated urothelial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess in a preliminary manner the efficacy of this combination (overall response rate&#xD;
      and progression free survival).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine in an exploratory manner programmed death (PD)-ligand (L)1 expression in&#xD;
      archival tumor specimens and to correlate this with patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of pembrolizumab. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2&#xD;
      treatment arms. (Patients who had received prior gemcitabine hydrochloride/cisplatin or&#xD;
      gemcitabine hydrochloride/carboplatin [GC] or methotrexate, vinblastine sulfate, adriamycin,&#xD;
      and cisplatin [MVAC] therapy are assigned to Arm A).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and&#xD;
      docetaxel IV over 60 minutes on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV as in Arm A and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30&#xD;
      minutes on days 1 and 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for 12 months in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 6 months.&#xD;
