      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotension occurs commonly during spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section and may result in&#xD;
      detrimental effects to the mother and foetus. A previous pilot study where images of the&#xD;
      pulse oximeter waveform study were taken, found that the dicrotic wave moved away from the&#xD;
      systolic wave during the onset of hypotension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators wish to download electronic data which describe the pulse oximeter pulse&#xD;
      wave to more accurately assess movement of the diastolic wave relative to the systolic wave&#xD;
      during spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 women undergoing caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia will be recruited by informed&#xD;
      consent for this observational study. Data downloaded from the pulse oximeter will be&#xD;
      analysed to identify movement of the dicrotic wave relative to the systolic wave and this&#xD;
      will be related to changes in blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED OUTCOMES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will establish best way to analyse changes in the pulse oximeter waveform&#xD;
      and the relationship between changes in pulse oximeter waveform morphology and the onset of&#xD;
      hypotension during spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPLICATIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of movement of the dicrotic wave could be used to anticipate and thus avoid severe&#xD;
      hypotension during spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a baby is delivered by a surgical procedure (a caesarean section) the women will usually&#xD;
      have a spinal anaesthetic. With a spinal anaesthetic local anaesthetic is injected into the&#xD;
      spinal fluid to make the woman numb from her chest to her feet allowing her to be comfortable&#xD;
      but awake during the birth. One of the common side effects of a spinal anaesthetic is that&#xD;
      the woman's blood pressure may fall making her feel unwell and (rarely) causing stress to the&#xD;
      unborn baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a caesarean section the blood pressure is usually measured every few minutes using a&#xD;
      cuff around the upper arm. However, the blood pressure may fall too quickly to be detected in&#xD;
      a timely fashion by this intermittent means. One of the other monitors used in all cases is&#xD;
      called a pulse oximeter. When this is attached to the patient's finger it detects the pulse&#xD;
      rate and how much oxygen there is in the blood. The pulse oximeter also produces an image of&#xD;
      the pulse wave in the finger. There is one pulse wave for every time the heart beats and it&#xD;
      has two components. The main part of the wave (the systolic wave) is caused by the heart beat&#xD;
      and the second part of the wave (the dicrotic wave) is a result of some of the energy from&#xD;
      the heart beat bouncing back from blood vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous study we used a digital camera to take images of the pulse oximeter monitor&#xD;
      screen so that we could record changes in the shape of the pulse wave. We found that as&#xD;
      patients' blood pressure fell the dicrotic wave moved further away from the systolic wave. We&#xD;
      now intend to down load the electronic data that make up the pulse oximeter waveform, so that&#xD;
      we can analyse the changes that occur more accurately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We believe that falling blood pressure may be detected earlier using analysis of movement of&#xD;
      the dicrotic wave than by our standard monitoring. This is because currently blood pressure&#xD;
      is measured intermittently whereas the pulse oximeter waveform is displayed continuously.&#xD;
      Drugs could then be given promptly to stop the blood pressure from falling so low that the&#xD;
      woman feels unwell or the unborn baby is affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aim is to observe changes in the position of the dicrotic wave during spinal anaesthesia&#xD;
      for caesarean section and relate these to the occurrence of low blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following ethical approval 20 women undergoing caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia&#xD;
      will be recruited by written informed consent. In theatre the electronic data which describe&#xD;
      the pulse oximeter waveform will be downloaded by means of a data logger. In parallel, we&#xD;
      will manually record the other perioperative data including the blood pressure. We will then&#xD;
      use the data to establish the best way of accurately and reproducibly identifying the&#xD;
      dicrotic wave when it moves in relation to the onset of low blood pressure. As this is an&#xD;
      observational study, the management of the case will be at the discretion of the attending&#xD;
      anaesthetist in discussion with the patient and will not be altered by inclusion in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED OUTCOMES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. We will establish the best way to detect movement of the dicrotic wave.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. We will establish the temporal relationship between movement of the dicrotic wave and&#xD;
           fall in blood pressure during spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPLICATIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthetists will be able to use movement of the dicrotic wave to anticipate and avert low&#xD;
      blood pressure during spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section.&#xD;
