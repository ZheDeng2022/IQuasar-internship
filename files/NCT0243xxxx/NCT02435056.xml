    <textblock>
      Appropriate delivery of quality healthcare requires constant monitoring of the patient during&#xD;
      follow up, particularly in the presence of chronic diseases. This approach can be further&#xD;
      improved if leading edge tools supporting diagnosis, as well as prediction, identification&#xD;
      and monitoring of adverse events are available. COMOESTAS aims to develop an innovative&#xD;
      Information Communications Technology (ICT) system that allows patients with a chronic&#xD;
      condition to receive continuous and personalized treatment. The whole system is based on an&#xD;
      advanced, &quot;all in one&quot; Alerting and Decision Support System that follows patients from the&#xD;
      diagnosis and supports the physician in managing the therapy, controlling relevant events&#xD;
      impacting on patient safety and activating specific procedures if selected thresholds are&#xD;
      exceeded. In the frame of chronic neurological disorders, Medication Overuse Headache (MOH)&#xD;
      is a common condition and a major cause of disability. MOH is curable, but its outcome is&#xD;
      hampered by a high risk of relapse. It is, therefore, a perfect example of a disorder that&#xD;
      can benefit from an ICT-assisted approach developing innovative systems and services for&#xD;
      monitoring chronic conditions. COMOESTAS goals will be achieved by improving and integrating&#xD;
      the traditional paper headache diaries and calendars into an innovative ICT tool taking into&#xD;
      account the complex issues that accompany this peculiar form of headache, which will make the&#xD;
      patient a key node in the entire process.&#xD;

      It will be a multicentre parallel group study. The two arms of the clinical protocol will be&#xD;
      1) classic approach to MOH and 2) Interactive Electronic Patient Record (IEPR)-based approach&#xD;
      to MOH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each arm will last 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MOH will be diagnosed according to the 2006 MOH-R criteria of the International Headache&#xD;
      Society as reported below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Headache present on &gt; 15 days/month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Regular overuse for &gt; 3 months of one or more acute symptomatic drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ergotamine, triptans, opioids or combination analgesic medications on &gt; 10 days/month on&#xD;
           a regular basis for &gt; 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Simple analgesics or any combination of ergotamine, triptans, analgesics or opioids on &gt;&#xD;
           15 days/month on a regular basis for &gt;3 months without overuse (&gt; 10 days) of any single&#xD;
           class alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Headache has developed or markedly worsened during medication overuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IEPR approach will be preliminarily tested and validated in small groups of patients&#xD;
      during months 6-12 (pilot validation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be evaluated over a period of 7 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Classic approach Visit 0: patient is examined and, if suspected to suffer from MOH, is asked&#xD;
      to fill in a diary for a month in order to quantify parameters of MOH (days with headache,&#xD;
      acute drugs consumed, etc.). Patient has to report that MOH-R criteria were fulfilled for the&#xD;
      previous 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Patient returns to the Centre, diary data are analyzed and recorded, and, if&#xD;
      criteria for MOH-R diagnosis are fulfilled and exclusion criteria are ruled out , patient is&#xD;
      enrolled in COMOESTAS protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detoxification: following visit 1, patient undergoes detoxification according to the protocol&#xD;
      in Appendix 1. In the subsequent 2 months the patient is instructed to record headache&#xD;
      characteristics and consumption of symptomatic drugs on a paper diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 (2 months after detoxification): patient is visited again; diary is checked; if&#xD;
      therapy is successful (patient no longer overuses acute medications for headache) the patient&#xD;
      is scheduled for a follow-up visit after 4 months. The patient is asked to keep up recording&#xD;
      headache characteristics and consumption of symptomatic drugs on a paper diary for the next 4&#xD;
      months and informed about a telephone contact after 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 (6 months after detoxification): patient is visited again, diary data are collected.&#xD;
      Study ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IEPR approach Visit 0: patient is examined and, if the minimum data set of the IEPR for MOH&#xD;
      is satisfied, the patients is asked to record the headache characteristics as well as acute&#xD;
      drugs consumption on a paper diary for a month in order to assess baseline parameters of MOH&#xD;
      (days with headache, acute drugs consumed, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient has to report that MOH-R criteria were fulfilled for the previous 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Patient returns to the Centre, diary data are analyzed and recorded, and, if&#xD;
      criteria for MOH diagnosis are confirmed and criteria of exclusion are ruled out, patient is&#xD;
      enrolled in COMOESTAS protocol .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detoxification: following Visit 1, patient undergoes detoxification according to the same&#xD;
      protocol adopted for the classic approach. During the detoxification phase, the patient is&#xD;
      instructed to use the electronic diary and is then asked to fill the electronic diary on a&#xD;
      regular basis (preferably daily or at least weekly) for the next 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 (2 months after detoxification): patient is visited again; if therapy is successful&#xD;
      (patient no longer overuses acute medications for headache), MOH diagnosis the patient is&#xD;
      scheduled for a follow-up visit after 4 months and informed about a telephone contact after 2&#xD;
      months. The patient is asked to keep up filling the electronic diary for the next 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3: the patient is visited again. Study ends.&#xD;
