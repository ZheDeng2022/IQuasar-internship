  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A large proportion of Asian patients with HCC present with locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      disease,at which point they are ineligible for curative treatments.Oxaliplatin plus&#xD;
      fluorouracil/leucovorin intravenous infusion was proved effective in prolonging&#xD;
      progression-free survival(PFS) than doxorubicin as palliative chemotherapy in patients with&#xD;
      advanced HCC from Asia. Besides, hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC）is a widely&#xD;
      used method for primary or metastasis liver tumor with high local tumor response. To our&#xD;
      knowledge, there have not been any prospective studies to assess the safety and effecacy of&#xD;
      HAIC using oxaliplatin plus fluorouracil/leucovorin for patients with locally advanced&#xD;
      HCC.Thus,the purpose of this phase 2 study was to assess the safety and effecacy of HAIC&#xD;
      using oxaliplatin plus fluorouracil/leucovorin for patients with locally advanced HCC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common malignancy worldwide and much more&#xD;
      common in male than in female. Each year, the number of patients with HCC in China alone&#xD;
      contributes to about 50% of the total cases and deaths in the world. In men, poor prognosis&#xD;
      makes HCC the second most frequent cause of cancer-related mortality in less developed&#xD;
      countries. Locally advanced or metastatic disease is found in 60%-70% of HCC patients at the&#xD;
      time diagnosed, with a median survival time of only 3-4 months due to unavailability of&#xD;
      potentially curative therapies. Therefore, treatments that can control the progression and&#xD;
      improve the prognosis of advanced HCC are under great need in sufficient liver reservation.&#xD;
      Recently, an oral multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib, was reported to significantly&#xD;
      prolong overall survival (OS) and delay disease progression in patients with advanced HCC. To&#xD;
      date, sorafenib is still the only standard treatment for advanced HCC approved by FDA.&#xD;
      However, low response rates, modest survival advantages, high-level heterogeneity of&#xD;
      individual response and relatively high cost, such limitations of sorafenib prohibit its&#xD;
      widespread use in advanced HCC and more alternative therapies are highly required at present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In fact, for the past 30 years, researchers never stop searching for effective&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic agents for HCC, and a wide spectrum of cytotoxic drugs have been reported by&#xD;
      a variety of studies, including doxorubicin, gemcitabine, capecitabine, 5-fluorouracil&#xD;
      (5-FU), cisplatin and so on. Unfortunately, low and heterogeneous responses and the&#xD;
      well-known toxic effects caused by chemotherapy severely slowed down the pace of drug&#xD;
      development for HCC. Until last year, based on a multicenter randomized clinical trial known&#xD;
      as the EACH study, Qin et al. reported that FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin [OXA], leucovorin [LV],&#xD;
      5-FU) regimen was associated with significant better OS than doxorubicin regimen (5.7 vs. 4.3&#xD;
      months; hazard ratio: 0.74; P = 0.03) in Chinese subgroup that accounted for 75% of the EACH&#xD;
      study population. This study has provided proof to suggest that the FOLFOX4 regimen may&#xD;
      become a potentially more efficacious alternative to doxorubicin in Chinese patients with&#xD;
      advanced HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, systemic toxicity of chemotherapy and impaired liver function is still a concern&#xD;
      that could not be neglected. Compared with systemic chemotherapy, hepatic arterial infusion&#xD;
      chemotherapy (HAIC) can provide chemotherapeutic agents to liver at higher concentration with&#xD;
      lower toxicity and has been reported favor results in patients with advanced HCC.&#xD;
      Additionally, for patients who are not initially eligible for curative treatment, e.g.,&#xD;
      resection or liver transplantation, HAIC may down disease stage and offer them a chance to&#xD;
      undergo such treatment which gives good long-term results. Though various agents such as 5-FU&#xD;
      and cisplatin were studied with HAIC, by far, there have been no data about the use of more&#xD;
      effective regimens FOLFOX4 in HAIC. Therefore, we carried out a multi-center, prospective&#xD;
      trial to investigate the effect and safety of HAI combined with FOLFOX4 regimens in Chinese&#xD;
      population with advanced HCC.&#xD;
