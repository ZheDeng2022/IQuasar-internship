  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scoliosis is a three-dimensional deformity affecting the orientation and position of the&#xD;
      spine. Locally, the shape of the vertebra is also affected. The most common form is&#xD;
      adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) with a prevalence of 1-3% affecting primarily young&#xD;
      adolescent females. AIS can either be treated using a brace and in some cases necessitate&#xD;
      surgical correction to prevent progressive deformity. Risk factors for progression include&#xD;
      female gender, curve magnitude and location, skeletal maturity and growth velocity. However,&#xD;
      these risk factors have been shown to be inconsistent in predicting curve progression. Over&#xD;
      the past 6 years, the investigators have developed a predictive model of the final Cobb angle&#xD;
      in AIS based on 3D spinal parameters. This analysis was based on a prospective cohort of 195&#xD;
      patients that were enrolled upon their initial visit and followed until maturity. This&#xD;
      predictive model has a determination coefficient of 0.702. The proposed new study aims at&#xD;
      refining and testing the external validity of this model in a larger cohort. The next step&#xD;
      towards using the new model in the clinical setting is to redesign the model and to&#xD;
      externally validate the model by measuring the agreement between the new method and the&#xD;
      traditional Cobb angle at maturity in a larger multicenter study. The objective of this study&#xD;
      is to characterize the risk of scoliosis progression based on local three-dimensional&#xD;
      vertebral and pelvic measurements present on initial evaluation. Three-dimensional&#xD;
      reconstructions will be derived from stereo-radiographs acquired with a new biplanar low-dose&#xD;
      radiographic system installed in all 8 clinical sites (EOS system, EOS-Imaging, Paris). These&#xD;
      calibrated radiographs will then be used to reconstruct the vertebrae and intervertebral&#xD;
      disks at each level as well as the geometry of the pelvis. A series of local and regional&#xD;
      parameters will then be calculated from these 3D reconstructions. Correlation analysis will&#xD;
      help determine if intervertebral disk wedging, vertebral wedging, transverse plane rotation&#xD;
      or pelvic geometry can be used as early predictors of curve progression in AIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identifying a new 3D measure of scoliosis associated with rapid curve progression could help&#xD;
      predict which curves need early treatment to prevent further progression. The ultimate goal&#xD;
      of this research project will be to validate this new predictive model and finally transfer&#xD;
      this new predictive tool in the hands of clinicians treating AIS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      By identifying the patients for whom the model predicts a significant progression the&#xD;
      investigators could focus their efforts on being more pro-active towards brace wear for those&#xD;
      at risk of progression. With the advent of new growth modulation techniques, these patients&#xD;
      could also potentially receive early management of their curves to prevent further&#xD;
      progression and diminish the need for surgical correction and fusion of their curve.&#xD;
      Alternatively, by identifying the patients that will not progress immediately at the first&#xD;
      visit, the investigators could arguably decrease their number needed to treat from 4 to 2 by&#xD;
      removing those patients that won't progress no matter what their treatment is. So, the&#xD;
      prediction model will not only have an impact for the patients at risk of progression but&#xD;
      will also impact those that are braced despite having a low risk of progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be offered enrollment in the project. If the&#xD;
      family wishes to enroll in the project, the informed consent process will be undertaken and&#xD;
      the patient will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If Patients need to be treated with brace No changes in the usual treatment and monitoring&#xD;
      will be instituted. Therefore, patients will be allowed to undergo brace treatment. The&#xD;
      investigators are aware that brace treatment could have an impact on curve progression but&#xD;
      these patients are still included as progression despite brace treatment may give meaningful&#xD;
      information regarding these difficult-to-treat curves. Patient under brace treatment will&#xD;
      have to remove brace at least the night before their appointment and follow-up spine&#xD;
      radiographs. Also the protocol requires that patients have at least one spine radiograph out&#xD;
      of brace every 12 months. Bracing compliance will be evaluated as a specific covariable in&#xD;
      the upcoming study. To better understand the impact of bracing on progression, the&#xD;
      investigators will be using brace monitors, pressure sensitive transducers that can monitor&#xD;
      brace wear and brace effectiveness, in their multicenter study and use the data generated by&#xD;
      these monitors as a co-factor in an improved prediction model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients need to have surgery Although patients showing sufficient curve progression to&#xD;
      undergo surgical correction will not be kept in the prospective cohort after surgery, their&#xD;
      data will still be analyzed to assess the correlation between local 3-D measurements and&#xD;
      curve progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected at first visit will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  past medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  gender&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  body-mass index (weight and height)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  family history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  sexual maturity (start of menses for girls)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  rib prominence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  initial radiographic evaluation. Data collected at each follow-up visit (ideally every 6&#xD;
           months)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  body-mass index (weight and height)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  menarchal status,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  skeletal maturity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  rib prominence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiographic evaluation (at least every 12 months during the study period, without&#xD;
           brace).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Image acquisition and transfer to central measurement site. Image acquisition is&#xD;
                standardized between sites according to standard operating procedures. All images&#xD;
                are acquired with the EOS™ system in the same fashion based on the position&#xD;
                proposed by Horton et al. that standardized lateral radiographs by using a&#xD;
                hand-on-clavicle position. The radiographs are all taken in the same way thus&#xD;
                minimizing variability. For the centers without an EOS™ system for part or for the&#xD;
                entire study, utilization of calibration belts will allow radiographs to be taken&#xD;
                in a calibrated environment. The position used for image acquisition is the same as&#xD;
                for the EOS™ system.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Three-dimensional reconstructions of the spine The stereo radiographic images are&#xD;
                used to create an external three-dimensional representation of the vertebral body&#xD;
                using a specific algorithm. First, a spline is fitted through the centers of the&#xD;
                vertebral bodies both on the PA and lateral views. The information from both images&#xD;
                is then used to reconstruct a 3-D spline or curve which will act as a rough&#xD;
                three-dimensional scaffold onto which the local vertebral and intervertebral&#xD;
                reconstructions will take place. The vertebral endplates are represented by a crude&#xD;
                preliminary model of the spine by using a set of cubic templates roughly&#xD;
                representing each vertebral body stacked on top of one another to form the spinal&#xD;
                column. A global configuration of the deformable spine model is thus described for&#xD;
                each cubic template associated with each vertebral level. The final reconstruction&#xD;
                can then be completed using a priori knowledge from a database of scoliotic and&#xD;
                normal vertebrae that were measured by the investigator's research group. The a&#xD;
                priori knowledge model relies on the description of each vertebra by a deformable&#xD;
                model, which incorporates statistical knowledge about its geometrical structure and&#xD;
                its pathological variability. The statistically optimized reconstructions will be&#xD;
                used to determine the intervertebral disk shape at each level.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Three-dimensional stereoradiographic reconstructions of the pelvis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pelvis will be reconstructed in 3-D for all normal and AIS subjects using a combination&#xD;
      of the Non-Stereo Corresponding Points (NSCP) and Non-Stereo Corresponding Contours (NSCC)&#xD;
      methods, which were successfully by the investigator's team to reconstruct the spine in 3D.&#xD;
      Preliminary evaluation of the technique gave an overall accuracy of 1,6 mm, which is adequate&#xD;
      for the calculation of clinical geometric indices of the pelvis. Four steps are required with&#xD;
      this 3D reconstruction technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identification of seven specific regions of the pelvis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Display of a preliminary model with 45 control points. The control points can be&#xD;
           modified in real time by the user (NSCP);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Interactive identification of regional contours (NSCC);&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Generation of the personalized 3D pelvic model by deforming a generic 3D pelvic model&#xD;
           using 3D geometrical kriging.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Local three-dimensional measurements of the vertebrae and disks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The calculated parameters were divided into six categories. Each category refers to global&#xD;
      (whole spine), regional (scoliotic segment) and local (vertebra) descriptors. Vertebra&#xD;
      centroid is understood as the halfway point between the centers of the two endplates of the&#xD;
      vertebra. The local vertebra axis system is defined by the Scoliosis Research Society (SRS)&#xD;
      3D terminology group: the origin is at the centroid of the vertebral body, the local 'z' axis&#xD;
      passes through the centers of the upper and lower endplates, and 'y' axis is parallel to a&#xD;
      line joining similar landmarks on the bases of the right and left pedicles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cobb Angles: Cobb angles defined as the angle between the upper and lower endplate of&#xD;
           the respective end vertebrae of a curve. Cobb angle was measured in the frontal plane,&#xD;
           in the plane of maximal deformation in 3D and in the sagittal plane for thoracic&#xD;
           kyphosis (T4-T12) and lumbar lordosis (L1-S1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Plane of maximal deformation: Axial angle of the plane in which the Cobb angle is&#xD;
           maximal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Three-dimensional wedging of vertebral body and disk: Wedging of the apical vertebral&#xD;
           body in the plane of maximal deformation (3D plane) and mean maximal 3D wedging of the&#xD;
           two apical intervertebral disks. Maximal 3D wedging represents the wedging measured in&#xD;
           the plane, wherein the wedging value is maximal around the vertical axis. If apex was a&#xD;
           disk, then the mean of the 3D wedging of both apical vertebral bodies was calculated and&#xD;
           only the 3D wedging of the apical disk was documented. 3D disk wedging was analyzed for&#xD;
           all levels of the spine (from T1-T2 to L4-L5).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Axial intervertebral rotation of the apex, upper and lower junctional level and&#xD;
           thoracolumbar level: Rotation between two adjacent vertebrae at upper, apical, and lower&#xD;
           curve levels and thoracolumbar junction (T12-L1) in the axial plane according to the&#xD;
           inferior local vertebrae reference.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Torsion: Mean of the sum of intervertebral axial rotation (measured according to the&#xD;
           local referential of the inferior vertebrae) of the two hemicurvatures of the curve&#xD;
           (between upper end vertebra and apex and between lower end vertebra and apex).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Slenderness (local T6, T12 and L4 and regional T1-L5): Ratio between the height&#xD;
           (distance between the superior and inferior endplates at the center of the vertebrae)&#xD;
           and the width (measured at the center of the vertebrae using a line perpendicular to the&#xD;
           height line in medio lateral direction) of the vertebral body for T6, T12 and L4&#xD;
           vertebrae. Ratio between the length of the spine from T1 to L5 and the mean of the width&#xD;
           of vertebral bodies of T6-T12 and L4. The same measurement was made by replacing the&#xD;
           width by the depth (a line perpendicular to the height line at the center of the&#xD;
           vertebra in an anteroposterior direction).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Geometric pelvic indices:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Geometric pelvic indices will be calculated automatically with the generation of the 3D&#xD;
      pelvic model. Indices describing the orientation of the pelvis in 3D (positional indices),&#xD;
      based on the line joining the center of both femoral heads (hip axis), will be calculated&#xD;
      first. Pelvic axial rotation is the orientation of the hip axis around the vertical axis&#xD;
      (gravity line) as viewed in the transverse plane. Pelvic obliquity is the orientation of the&#xD;
      hip axis around the horizontal line as viewed from the coronal plane. Pelvic tilt is the&#xD;
      orientation of the pelvis around the medio-lateral axis of the pelvis as viewed from the&#xD;
      sagittal plane. In this last case, at least another landmark from the pelvis (such as the&#xD;
      center of the upper sacral plate) needs to be identified in addition to the hip axis. The&#xD;
      sacral slope (angle between the upper sacral plate and the horizontal line is also calculated&#xD;
      since it is highly correlated with lumbar lordosis. Sacral obliquity is the angle between the&#xD;
      upper sacral plate and the horizontal line. Morphological indices of the pelvis (not&#xD;
      dependent on the patient's position) are computed in a reference coordinate system based on&#xD;
      the hip axis orientation, in order to eliminate the effect of pelvic axial rotation and&#xD;
      obliquity. This means that transformation into the reference coordinate system allows&#xD;
      calculation of morphological indices in the true coronal, axial and sagittal planes of the&#xD;
      pelvis. The investigators selected the pelvis as their reference system based on the pelvic&#xD;
      vertebra principle from Dubousset, which states that the pelvis can be viewed as a separate&#xD;
      vertebra. As described earlier, numerous morphologic parameters of the pelvis have been used&#xD;
      in the past, as detailed in Tables I to III. Of these, after a thorough review of the&#xD;
      literature, the investigators selected what they consider the 7 most pertinent specific&#xD;
      indices. The investigators based their decision on the potential association of the pelvic&#xD;
      indices with the pathogenesis of AIS. Since they demonstrated the close relationship between&#xD;
      pelvic incidence and lumbar lordosis in AIS, the investigators selected morphological indices&#xD;
      of the pelvis that are correlated with the spine geometry.&#xD;
