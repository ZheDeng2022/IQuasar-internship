      INTRODUCTION Upper tact urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) arises from the urothelial lining of the&#xD;
      urinary tract from the renal calyces to the ureteral orifice. It comprises 10 % of all renal&#xD;
      tumors and 5% of all urothelial malignancies (Jemal et al., 2007). A common feature of UTUC&#xD;
      is multiple anatomic locations in the urinary tract either synchronous or metachronous. While&#xD;
      synchronous bladder tumor can be identified at time of evaluation of UTUC, recurrent bladder&#xD;
      tumor remains a major concern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incidence of bladder recurrence after management of UTUC varies considerably from 20% - 50%&#xD;
      (Kirkali and Tuzel., 2003; Hall et al., 1998). Although the risk factors for development of&#xD;
      bladder tumor post surgical management of UTUC were previously studied, considerable&#xD;
      variations were observed in the literature. In a recent meta-analysis, Seisen et al., in 2014&#xD;
      have identified male gender, previous bladder cancer, and preoperative chronic kidney disease&#xD;
      as patient-specific predictors. While tumor-specific predictors were as follows: positive&#xD;
      preoperative urinary cytology, ureteral location, multifocality, invasive stage, and&#xD;
      necrosis. Lastly, treatment-specific predictors were a laparoscopic approach, extravesical&#xD;
      bladder cuff removal, and positive surgical margins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, two theories have been proposed for intravesical recurrence after radical&#xD;
      nephroureterectomy including intraluminal seeding of a single transformed cell (Habuchi et&#xD;
      al., 1993) and pan-urothelial field defect e.g. carcinogenic exposure of the entire&#xD;
      urothelial tract can lead to independent multifocal development (Takahashi et al., 2001;&#xD;
      Jones et al., 2005). Therefore, it has been suggested that administration of a single dose of&#xD;
      intravesical chemotherapy in the early postoperative period might prevent seeding of&#xD;
      transitional cancer cells and therefore might help reduce the incidence of urothelial tumor&#xD;
      recurrence in the first year post surgery (O'Brien et al., 2011). To the best of our&#xD;
      knowledge, only two randomized controlled trials have investigated this hypothesis (O'Brien&#xD;
      et al., 2011; Ito et al., 2013 ). O' Brien et al., 2011, have reported 16% of patients in the&#xD;
      mitomycin C arm and 27% of patients in the standard treatment arm developed bladder cancer&#xD;
      recurrence within the first year postoperative. Ito et al., 2013, reported 16.9% of patients&#xD;
      in the pirarubicin arm and 31.8% of patients in the standard treatment arm developed bladder&#xD;
      cancer recurrence within the first postoperative year. Based on these findings, it has been&#xD;
      recommended in the last European association of urology guidelines that postoperative&#xD;
      instillation of chemotherapy is recommended to avoid bladder cancer recurrence &quot;grade B&#xD;
      recommendation&quot; (Roupret et al., 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2001 Sakamoto et al., examined the significance of intravesical instillation of Mitomycin&#xD;
      C and cytosine arabinoside over 2 years period. They showed that instillation would reduce&#xD;
      the recurrence rate in the bladder after surgery for upper urinary tract tumors. However,&#xD;
      this study was underpowered to detect the desired difference. The investigators hypothesized&#xD;
      that the 16% incidence of bladder tumor recurrence after single postoperative instillation of&#xD;
      intravesical chemotherapy after surgery for UTUC might be attributed to the influence of&#xD;
      pan-urothelial field defect theory. Therefore, the investigators assume that maintenance&#xD;
      intravesical chemotherapy would significantly reduce this percentage of tumor recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM OF THE WORK This clinical trial is designed to compare the effect of single postoperative&#xD;
      intravesical chemotherapy instillation versus maintenance therapy on reducing bladder cancer&#xD;
      recurrence after surgery for UTUC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENTS AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of the study A randomized controlled trial (RCT), phase II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study locality Urology Nephrology Center (UNC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with UTUC will be prospectively randomized into two groups using excel software by&#xD;
      random table function:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group 1: will receive single intravesical dose of epirubicin intravesical therapy (50&#xD;
           mg) within 48 hours of radical nephroureterectomy with open bladder cuff excision.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group 2: will receive a single intravesical dose of epirubicin and an additional 6&#xD;
           weekly doses of intravesical therapy (50 mg) after surgery then monthly maintenance&#xD;
           therapy for 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with history of bladder tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients with synchronous bladder tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients with advanced stage (T4)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation and Statistical analysis All statistical analysis will be performed using&#xD;
      IBM v. 20 statistical software and the statistical tests will be used appropriately whenever&#xD;
      indicated. The calculation of sample size is conducted using G*power statistical software&#xD;
      (Faul F et al., 2007). The recurrence rate in the control arm of the study was reported to be&#xD;
      16% after single intravesical dose of chemotherapy. If the expected treatment effect of&#xD;
      maintenance chemotherapy was similar to that observed in bladder tumor, there would be a&#xD;
      reduction in recurrence rate by 38% )Huncharek M et al., 2001). Therefore, to detect this&#xD;
      level of difference at a power of 80% and 5% level of significance, 35 patients will be&#xD;
      required to detect the difference between groups (1) and (2) and accounting for 15% losses in&#xD;
      each arm, 40 patients will be randomized in each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Patients will be randomly allocated into one of the two groups using excel&#xD;
      software by random table function at the day of surgery. Radical nephroureterectomy will be&#xD;
      done through the open or laparoscopic approach while bladder cuff excision will be performed&#xD;
      through the open approach. All data will be prospectively maintained and include patients'&#xD;
      demographics, preoperative laboratory parameters, operative details and postoperative&#xD;
      complications&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up The scheduled follow up will be according to the EUA guidelines (Roupret M et al.,&#xD;
      2013) by scheduling a urine cytology and cystoscopy at 3 months then at one year while CT&#xD;
      urography at one year for non-invasive tumors and at 6 months and one year for invasive&#xD;
      tumors. All chemotherapy-related complications will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome and end-point The primary outcome of the study is the diagnosis of intravesical&#xD;
      recurrence within the first year after surgery. The secondary outcome is to determine the&#xD;
      adverse events postoperative morbidity, mortality and survival of patients with UTUC.&#xD;
