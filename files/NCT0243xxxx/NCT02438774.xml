  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been shown that exposure to mycotoxins through complementary foods and breast milk had&#xD;
      profound effects on growth of children from 6 months to 1 year of age. In Tanzania maize is&#xD;
      the main ingredient for complementary food, however, the crop is vulnerable to mycotoxins&#xD;
      contamination. it has been reported that the most effective way to reduce mycotoxin exposure&#xD;
      is to lower the mycotoxins contamination of maize. This study has developed a post-harvest&#xD;
      intervention package for use in rural Tanzania to reduce contamination of maize and breast&#xD;
      milk with two forms of mycotoxins; aflatoxins and fumonisins. It is composed of 5 components;&#xD;
      1) hand sorting, 2) drying surface, 3) proper drying 4) application of insecticide, 5)&#xD;
      dehulling and was introduced in three main maize producing agro-ecological zones. The&#xD;
      intervention used randomised controlled trial design where infants less than 8 six months of&#xD;
      age were recruited and followed up 6 months after recruitment. The intervention expects to&#xD;
      demonstrate the effectiveness of the post harvest intervention package in reducing aflatoxins&#xD;
      and fumonisins contamination of maize and subsequent exposure of these toxins to infants and&#xD;
      young children through maize based complementary food and breast milk. The findings will be&#xD;
      used in developing guidelines for farmers and extension officers to reduce aflatoxins and&#xD;
      fumonisins contamination of maize and improve the health of the infants and the whole&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothiseses that introducing post-harvest intervention package can reduce&#xD;
      aflatoxins and fumonisins contamination of maize and subsquent exposure of these toxins to&#xD;
      infants and young children through maize based complementary foods and breast milk than&#xD;
      routine agriculture extension services offered to the farmers in rural Tanzania. The specific&#xD;
      objectives include;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effectiveness of post-harvest intervention package on reduction of&#xD;
           aflatoxins and fumonisins contamination of maize and in breast milk&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To perform exposure assessment of aflatoxins and fumonisins to infants and young&#xD;
           children through maize based complementary food and breast milk&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To perform risk characterization of aflatoxins and fumonisins exposure to infants and&#xD;
           young children through maize based complementary foods and breast milk&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the association between exposure to aflatoxins and fumonisins and child growth&#xD;

      Study sites , selection criteria and settings:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was conducted in three different agro-ecological zones (AEZ) of Tanzania; these&#xD;
      are Northern Highlands, South-western Highlands and Eastern Lowland zones. For each zone, one&#xD;
      maize-producing district, primarily for home consumption, was purposively selected, Hanang'&#xD;
      district representing the Northern Highlands, Kilosa district represent Eastern Lowland zone&#xD;
      and Rungwe represents the South Western Highlands. For each district, ten villages; five&#xD;
      interventions and five control was randomly selected. From each village, 10 households were&#xD;
      chosen. The selection criterion of the households were to be a local maize cultivars /grower,&#xD;
      capacity of storing maize for the period not less than five to six months after harvest and&#xD;
      having lactating mother of a child less than 8 months of age. Therefore, a total of 300&#xD;
      households; 100 selected from each of districts were involved in the study. The three&#xD;
      districts each are divided into a divisions, wards and villages. A village is the lowest&#xD;
      administrative unit and is considered as a geopolitical unit and intact social group. It has&#xD;
      a local government authority and committees. Each village has one agriculture extension&#xD;
      officer who is a Government employee under the Local Government Authority. The extension&#xD;
      services provided includes the provision of farmers with knowledge, information, experiences&#xD;
      and technologies needed to increase and sustain productivity and for improved wellbeing and&#xD;
      livelihoods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study used a Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial. Villages were randomly assigned to either&#xD;
      the intervention or control study groups. The intervention duration was 6 months. The control&#xD;
      group continued to receive routine agriculture extension services on good practices for&#xD;
      handling crops , an agricultural extension service for farmers offered regularly by village&#xD;
      agriculture extension officer at vilage level. The extension services provided includes the&#xD;
      provision of farmers with knowledge, information, experiences and technologies needed to&#xD;
      increase and sustain productivity, avoid crop spoilage during storage for improved wellbeing&#xD;
      and livelihoods. The intervention group received post-harvset intervention package in&#xD;
      addition to the routine agriculture education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One month before harvest , infants aged less than 8 months were recruited from the register&#xD;
      of births in child and reproductive health clinics in each village. Infants of less than 8&#xD;
      months of age were identified using their registration number and date of birth. In Tanzania,&#xD;
      all infants born in clinics are registered soon after birth. In case of home deliveries,&#xD;
      registration is done on the day the child is taken to the clinic for immunization. On&#xD;
      registration, each child is allocated a registration number and the child's particulars&#xD;
      including date and place of birth recorded. Inclusion criteria were to be a breastfeeding&#xD;
      infant aged 0-8 months at the time of recruitment, parents to be local residence, maize&#xD;
      grower and capacity of storing maize for the period not less than six months after harvest.&#xD;
      An exclusion criterion was abnormalities impairing feeding or physical growth measurements of&#xD;
      an infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Application requesting ethical approval was made to the National Institute of Medical&#xD;
      Research in Tanzania. Local government nutritionists, resident nurses and sociologists were&#xD;
      involved in this study. With the help of village executive officers, mothers of the eligible&#xD;
      infants were requested to gather at a nearby health facility or school to have informal&#xD;
      meetings. During the meetings, the objective of the research, use of the results, benefits of&#xD;
      the research to them and the procedure used to select them were explained and their formal&#xD;
      consent sought. Mothers were also provided with written forms containing the same&#xD;
      information. For the mothers who were not able to read and write, the resident nurse read the&#xD;
      consent form and asked them for their verbal consent. For those mothers who gave their verbal&#xD;
      consent, the local nurse wrote her/his name on the consent form and signed on it as a&#xD;
      witness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The developed post-harvest intervention package composed of 5 components, namely 1) hand&#xD;
      sorting, 2) drying surface, 3) proper drying 4) application of insecticide, 5) dehulling was&#xD;
      elaborated and discussed among Local Government agriculture workers. They later provided&#xD;
      guidance to farmers explained the intervention strategy and demonstrated different techniques&#xD;
      included in the package. Farmers were provided with guidelines on how to apply the developed&#xD;
      package. The language of communication during the intervention delivery was Kiswahili, a&#xD;
      written and spoken language in the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Component 1: Hand sorting&#xD;
&#xD;
      Separating damaged/infected maize kernel and cobs from health normal one helps to reduce&#xD;
      spread of mould during storage. Farmers were shown how to identify damaged maize kernel and&#xD;
      that are visibly mouldy. They were encouraged to remove and discard mouldy and damaged maize&#xD;
      kernels before storage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Component 2: Drying practice&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maize are commonly spread on the bare ground for sun drying, making them susceptible to&#xD;
      humidity, fungal contamination from the soil, and difficult to gather in the event of&#xD;
      unexpected rain. Farmers were trained on proper drying practices that include drying maize on&#xD;
      mats. We provided intervention group with the drying mats.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Component 3: Proper sun drying&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incomplete sun drying leaves residual humidity in the maize during storage. Maize should be&#xD;
      dried in such a manner that moisture levels are lower than those required to support mould&#xD;
      growth during storage (generally less than 13%). This is necessary to prevent further growth&#xD;
      of a number of fungal species that may be present on fresh grains. Farmers were shown how to&#xD;
      judge the completeness of sun drying by applying the &quot;salt and bottle technique&quot;; with this&#xD;
      technique, salt and maize grain are put together in the transparent glass bottle, then shaken&#xD;
      for about 5 minutes, if salt sticks on the walls of the bottle and on maize grain surface, it&#xD;
      indicates that the right moisture content has not been attained, when no stickiness is noted,&#xD;
      then it indicates the completeness of drying. The technique was validated in the laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Component 4: Application of insecticides&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the main factors affecting mycotoxins formation is the presence of insects in storage&#xD;
      facilities, which produce humidity via metabolic activity and spread fungal spores. This may&#xD;
      be minimised by use of suitable, registered insecticides and fungicides. Farmers were&#xD;
      provided with packs of insecticides. Explanations on the application of insecticides were&#xD;
      given to farmers according to the instruction of use for a particular insecticide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Component 5: Dehulling&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mycotoxins are likely to be more concentrated in the outer parts (pericarp and embryo) of the&#xD;
      maize grain so that removal of these parts would result in a reduction of the toxin level in&#xD;
      maize. Importance of de-hulling was explained to farmers and were encouraged to de-hull maize&#xD;
      before milling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and measuring impact of the intervention package:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maize grain samples intended for human consumption were collected at harvest and six months&#xD;
      after harvest, while ready to cook maize flour and breast milk samples were taken six months&#xD;
      after harvest. All samples were transported to Tanzania Food and Drugs Authority in Dar es&#xD;
      Salaam for laboratory analysis. Maize grains were finely grounded before the analysis. An&#xD;
      information sheet were prepared and completed for samples from each household to collect all&#xD;
      the information on post-harvest practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A food intake survey was conducted between five to six months after harvest. Replicas, 24h&#xD;
      dietary recall technique was used to estimate amount of maize based food consumed by the&#xD;
      infants and mothers. Two visits at an interval of 1 to 2 weeks were made to the home of each&#xD;
      of the infants. In addition to 24 dietary recalls, food frequency questionnaire was&#xD;
      administered to get information of the frequency of consumption of maize per week and other&#xD;
      foods that are commonly consumed by the mother and the child. A questionnaire that was&#xD;
      previously used by other researchers in communities in Tanzania which have food consumption&#xD;
      habits similar to the communities in the area of our study was used. The amount of maize&#xD;
      flour consumed by an infant from a thin (Uji) or stiff (ugali) porridge will be assessed&#xD;
      using the Lucille food intake software of Ghent University. This will also be carried out in&#xD;
      accordance to the quantity of food consumed and the food preparation techniques described in&#xD;
      the Tanzania food composition tables. Breast milk intake will be estimated as documented by&#xD;
      United State Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA, 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric measurement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each child's weight and date of birth was obtained from his or her clinic card or aregister&#xD;
      of birth in local health clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mycotoxin analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemical and reagent: Aflatoxins total, aflatoxin M1 and Fumonisins standards. Acetonitrile,&#xD;
      Acetic acid and Methanol of HPLC grade, Methanol, HCL, KOH, BORAX, OPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aflatoxin B1, B2, G1 and G2 were determined in the maize in accordance with the method&#xD;
      described by Stroka et al (2000). It was extracted and cleaned using AflaStar immunoaffinity&#xD;
      column (AIC), AFM1 was analysed in breast milk as described by (Magoha et al. 2014)&#xD;
      extraceextracted and cleaned using immunoaffinity column for AFM1 (AFLAPREP M) and fumonisin&#xD;
      analysis in breast milk and maize flour was analysed as described by (Magoha et al. 201a) and&#xD;
      (Sydenham et al. 1992) respectively, in both cases samples were extracted and cleaned using&#xD;
      SAX column, the extract were dried under nitrogen and reconsituted by ACN:H20 (1:1), and&#xD;
      derivatization was done by OPA. Quantification of all toxins was done using HPLC with&#xD;
      RF-10AXL detector.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure assessment and risk characterisation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exposure of the children to mycotoxins will be assessed by combining the maize&#xD;
      consumption data with the contamination data from the analyses. The exposure will be assessed&#xD;
      individually, using individual consumption data and body weight (bw) of each infant according&#xD;
      to the following formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ei,j = Ci x Lj/Bwi&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where Ei,j is the exposure to the contaminant j (μg/kg bw/day) for the subject i, Ci, is the&#xD;
      consumption level of the maize by the subject i (kg/ day , Lj is the level of contaminant j&#xD;
      in the maize (μg/kg) , BWi is the body weight of the subject i (kg). The individual exposure&#xD;
      to each mycotoxin will be compared with the health based guidance value (TDI, PMTDI, or&#xD;
      PTWI), and the children rate exceeding the health-based guidance value will be calculated&#xD;
      with the 95% confidence interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management and statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be entered in double in Epipdata 3.1 (Odense Denmark). Data analysis will be&#xD;
      carried out in SPSS version 16.0 for Windows . Statistical significance will be set at P&lt;0.05&#xD;
      for all tests. Chi square test will be used to determine association between post-harvest&#xD;
      handling practices of maize and fumonisins and aflatoxins content in maize and breast milk&#xD;
      and exposure to infants.&#xD;
