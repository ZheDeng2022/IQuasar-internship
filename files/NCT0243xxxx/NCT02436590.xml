      The hypothesis of this study is that exposure to PEMF alters the cytokine environment of OA&#xD;
      joints associated with a reduction of inflammation and improved homeostasis of the&#xD;
      extracellular matrix (ECM), both potentially effecting symptomatic relief of OA pain,&#xD;
      reducing cartilage breakdown, stimulate new cartilage formation therefore preserving joint&#xD;
      structure.&#xD;

      The hypothesis of this study is that exposure to PEMF alters the cytokine environment of OA&#xD;
      joints associated with a reduction of inflammation and improved homeostasis of the&#xD;
      extracellular matrix (ECM), both potentially effecting symptomatic relief of OA pain,&#xD;
      reducing cartilage breakdown, stimulate new cartilage formation therefore preserving joint&#xD;
      structure. The primary objective of this study is to prospectively determine, at 12 months&#xD;
      post treatment, the safety and efficacy of treating OA of the knee with PEMF. Safety will be&#xD;
      assessed through adverse event collection. Study subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio&#xD;
      (active: placebo control) to either an active or placebo control (inactive) Physio-Stim&#xD;
      device. The study is powered to detect a significant difference between groups when 120&#xD;
      subjects (80 active: 40 placebo control) have completed the study. Planned enrollment for the&#xD;
      study is 150 subjects, to allow for an attrition rate of 20%.&#xD;
