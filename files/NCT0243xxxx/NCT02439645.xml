      This is a registry to examine genetic and clinical predictors of torsade de pointes events.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Drug-induced long QT syndrome (LQTS), and the subsequent fatal&#xD;
      arrhythmia torsade de pointes (TdP), is an important side effect associated with the use of a&#xD;
      number of medications. Prolongation of the QT interval is the most common cause of withdrawal&#xD;
      of medications already on the market, and despite the relatively rarity with&#xD;
      non-cardiovascular drugs, the public health impact is magnified by the fact that drug-induced&#xD;
      TdP can occur with medications used for benign conditions, such as allergic rhinitis. The QT&#xD;
      interval is heritable, and a number of common genetic variants have been associated with QT&#xD;
      interval in large population studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although common genetic variants associated with sudden cardiac death have been identified,&#xD;
      studies specifically identifying variants associated with drug-induced LQTS and TdP are&#xD;
      limited. Smaller studies have suggested that variants of genes associated with QT interval&#xD;
      duration in the population in general are also associated with the risk of drug-induced QT&#xD;
      prolongation and TdP, but larger studies are needed. Moreover, an improved ability to predict&#xD;
      the causes of TdP requires a careful search for clinical factors associated with TdP compared&#xD;
      to controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Study Design and Enrollment: We propose to conduct a multi-center research study to&#xD;
      examine known and explore potentially unknown genetic and clinical predictors of torsade de&#xD;
      pointes (TdP) also known as acquired long QT syndrome (LQTS) through creation of a registry.&#xD;
      Any patient with a documented history of a torsade de pointes (TdP) event will be eligible.&#xD;
      Patients must be able to understand the risks of genetic testing, and be willing to undergo a&#xD;
      venipuncture for blood collection for genotyping. Exclusion criteria include inability to&#xD;
      provide informed consent. We plan to enroll a total of 200 study participants total across&#xD;
      all participating centers. Massachusetts General Hospital will be the coordinating center of&#xD;
      this multi-center study of medical institutions within the greater Boston and New England&#xD;
      area. In a substudy to take place at MGH, subjects will be invited to have a punch biopsy of&#xD;
      the skin to allow creation of inducible pluripotent stem cells that can be differentiated&#xD;
      into cardiomyocytes for further characterization of the repolarization phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Study Procedures: We will screen patients for enrollment including both retrospective&#xD;
      (event prior to the start of the study) and prospective (event following the start of the&#xD;
      study) components. Patients will be identified by investigators based on clinical&#xD;
      characteristics, and following explanation of the study by co-investigators, will be asked&#xD;
      about participation either during routine scheduled follow-up (for retrospective cases) or at&#xD;
      the sentinel event. Investigators will complete a data collection form for each patient,&#xD;
      which will include contact information, demographic information, clinical information, family&#xD;
      history and pedigree, and all electrocardiography information available (12-lead ECGs, rhythm&#xD;
      strips and summary reports). No information about mental illness will be collected. Patients&#xD;
      will then undergo venipuncture, and four 5mL blood samples will be collected for genotyping&#xD;
      and plasma analysis. For patients who are willing, a 3mm punch biopsy from the shoulder,&#xD;
      upper thigh, small of the back, or buttock (subject's choice) will be obtained for fibroblast&#xD;
      culture. Patients who are recruited at non-MGH sites will have a visit to MGH scheduled in&#xD;
      order to obtain the skin biopsy. Induced pluripotent stem cells will be made from the&#xD;
      fibroblast cultures and differentiated to cardiomyocytes in order to assess the cellular&#xD;
      phenotype. Patients will also be consented for future re-contact about additional data,&#xD;
      information, or samples needed for analysis. All clinical information and samples (including&#xD;
      DNA and blood) collected at participating centers will be transferred to Dr. Newton-Cheh at&#xD;
      MGH for storage and analysis.&#xD;

        For simplicity, we will plan to include all possible cases of TdP meeting criteria (see&#xD;
        below) into the registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. age &lt;18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. inability to obtain informed consent from the patient or a family member&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. no exclusion on the basis of race or gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        torsade de pointes clinical syndrome according to one of the following three clinical&#xD;
        criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Definite TdP: At least 3 beats of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) or&#xD;
             ventricular fibrillation (VF) on a 12-lead ECG or rhythm strip with documented QTc &gt;&#xD;
             450 ms in men or QTc &gt; 470 in women (excluding patients with conduction block or AF at&#xD;
             baseline, see below) prior to arrhythmic event.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Probable TdP: At least 3 beats of polymorphic VT or VF on a 12-lead ECG or rhythm&#xD;
             strip with QTc &gt; 450ms (men) or 470ms (women) after the event, or polymorphic VT or VF&#xD;
             episode not meeting criteria for 'definite TdP' but determined by the adjudicating&#xD;
             physician to be likely TdP. For patients having a cardiac arrest, at least 1 hour&#xD;
             after restoration of normal rhythm or after secondary hypoxia or electrolyte&#xD;
             abnormalities have been ruled out (confounders of QT prolongation often seen&#xD;
             post-arrest47) will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Possible TdP: Unexplained syncope in a patient presenting with QTc &gt; 450ms (men) or&#xD;
             470ms (women).&#xD;
