      This is a phase 1/2, uncontrolled, open-label, multicenter study in patients with MDS for&#xD;
      whom no effective therapies currently exist. In the Phase 1 part, high risk and low risk&#xD;
      patients with MDS requiring additional treatment will be enrolled, and two different dose&#xD;
      levels of DSP-7888 (3.5 and 10.5 mg/body) will be investigated in a stepwise manner starting&#xD;
      with the lower dose using the 3+3 design, to determine the MTD and the RD for the Phase 2&#xD;
      part based on DLT evaluation during the 29 days following the initial dose of DSP-7888. In&#xD;
      the Phase 2 part, DSP-7888 therapy at the RD determined by the Phase 1 part will be&#xD;
      administered to high risk patients with MDS who had received and not responded to azacitidine&#xD;
      as a standard treatment.&#xD;
