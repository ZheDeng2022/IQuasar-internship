  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease is a common and serious disease, the leading cause of death&#xD;
      worldwide. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is common and often under-diagnosed in&#xD;
      coronary artery disease where it could be involved in the pathophysiology and perhaps&#xD;
      prognosis. The entanglement of the two pathologies is actually quite well known, in&#xD;
      particular the consequences of one over the other just beginning to be studied. Understanding&#xD;
      the pathophysiology through new imaging modalities should improve the management of patients&#xD;
      to propose new approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;SAS-IDM&quot; is an interventional and prospective study conducted at the University Hospital of&#xD;
      Montpellier. Patients will be divided in three groups depending of the results of the&#xD;
      polysomnography: 1/ AHI &lt; 5/h: normal, without OSA ; 2/ 5/h ≤ AHI &lt; 30/h: mild or moderate&#xD;
      OSA ; 3/ IAH ≥ 30/h: severe OSA. A treatment by CPAP will be proposed to patients of the&#xD;
      group &quot;severe OSA&quot;.&#xD;
