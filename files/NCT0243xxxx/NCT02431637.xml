      This is a single-centre, open-label study using P. falciparum-induced blood stage malaria&#xD;
      (IBSM) infection to assess the infectivity of sexual life cycle stages of the malaria&#xD;
      parasite (gametocytes) to mosquito vectors. Previous clinical studies have shown that&#xD;
      treatment of participants with the antimalarial drug piperaquine, in addition to effectively&#xD;
      clearing asexual (pathogenic) stages of the malaria life cycle, induces the production of&#xD;
      gametocytes in the blood. The propensity of piperaquine to induce gametocytemia will be&#xD;
      employed in this study to assess gametocyte infectivity to Anopheles mosquitoes. For this&#xD;
      purpose, experimental mosquito feeding directly on participants and artificial membrane&#xD;
      mosquito feeding will be performed. The study will be conducted in 3 cohorts (n=2 per&#xD;
      cohort). Subsequent cohorts will not commence until at least after day 28 of the previous&#xD;
      cohort and review by Safety Review Team. This interval will also allow cohorting of&#xD;
      experimental infection of mosquitoes to optimise logistics and enable iterative improvements&#xD;
      in the system if applicable.&#xD;

      This is a single-centre, open-label study using P. falciparum-induced blood stage malaria&#xD;
      (IBSM) infection to assess the infectivity of sexual life cycle stages of the malaria&#xD;
      parasite (gametocytes) to mosquito vectors. Previous clinical studies have shown that&#xD;
      treatment of participants with the antimalarial drug piperaquine, in addition to effectively&#xD;
      clearing asexual (pathogenic) stages of the malaria life cycle, induces the production of&#xD;
      gametocytes in the blood. The propensity of piperaquine to induce gametocytemia will be&#xD;
      employed in this study to assess gametocyte infectivity to Anopheles mosquitoes. For this&#xD;
      purpose, experimental mosquito feeding directly on participants and artificial membrane&#xD;
      mosquito feeding will be performed. The study will be conducted in 3 cohorts (n=2 per&#xD;
      cohort). Subsequent cohorts will not commence until at least after day 28 of the previous&#xD;
      cohort and review by Safety Review Team. This interval will also allow cohorting of&#xD;
      experimental infection of mosquitoes to optimise logistics and enable iterative improvements&#xD;
      in the system if applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant in the cohort will be inoculated on Day 0 with ~2,800 viable parasites of&#xD;
      Plasmodium falciparum-infected human erythrocytes (BSPC) administered intravenously. On an&#xD;
      outpatient basis, participants will be monitored daily via phone call and then daily (AM)&#xD;
      from day 4 (until PCR positive for presence of malaria parasites). Once PCR positive they&#xD;
      will be monitored twice-daily morning (AM) and evening (PM) until treatment, for adverse&#xD;
      events and the unexpected early onset of symptoms, signs or parasitological evidence of&#xD;
      malaria. On the day designated for commencement of treatment, as determined by qPCR results&#xD;
      (approximately day 6-8), participants will be admitted to the study unit and monitored. The&#xD;
      threshold for commencement of treatment will be when PCR quantification of all participants&#xD;
      is = 5,000 parasites/mL. If the PCR quantification of any participant is = 10,000&#xD;
      parasites/mL and is accompanied by a clinical symptom score &gt;8 occurs in any participant&#xD;
      before all participants have reached the treatment threshold (PCR quantification of = 5,000),&#xD;
      then treatment of that participant will begin within a 24 h period. Participants will be&#xD;
      followed up as inpatients for at least 48 hours to ensure tolerance of the treatment and&#xD;
      clinical response, then if clinically well on an outpatient basis for safety and clearance of&#xD;
      malaria parasites via PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following treatment with piperaquine, transmission studies will be undertaken when&#xD;
      gametocytemia appears. Blood will be collected (AM) from each participant for membrane&#xD;
      feeding assays with An. Stephensi. For membrane feeding studies, blood will be kept at 38C&#xD;
      (to prevent premature exflagellation) for up to 35 minutes until dispensed into membrane&#xD;
      feeders. For direct feeding studies, participants will be escorted to the quarantine&#xD;
      insectary facility at QIMR Berghofer and will also be asked to allow vector mosquitoes to&#xD;
      feed on the volar surface of their forearms or thighs for a period of 10 ± 5 minutes (direct&#xD;
      feeding assay). The experimental infection of mosquitoes by direct feeding on participants&#xD;
      will be performed up to 3 times, and by artificial (indirect) membrane feeding up to 10 times&#xD;
      prior to curative antimalarial treatment at the End Of Study with Riamet®&#xD;
      (artemether-lumefantrine) and primaquine (45 mg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A repeat dose of piperaquine 960 mg may be administered on an outpatient basis if&#xD;
      recrudescent asexual parasitemia occurs as defined by consecutively increasing parasite count&#xD;
      over 1000 parasites/mL. Preemptive rescue treatment with Riamet® can commence whenever deemed&#xD;
      necessary by the investigator. Participants can be administered the rescue Riamet® on site&#xD;
      for initial dosing followed by monitoring, either in clinic, or by telephone for three days&#xD;
      to ensure adherence to Riamet® therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be treated with a single dose of primaquine (45 mg) as described in section&#xD;
      4.4.2 in this protocol concurrent with their Riamet® treatment to ensure clearance of any&#xD;
      gametocytes present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will be monitored via telephone monitoring, within the clinical research unit,&#xD;
      and on outpatient review after malaria challenge inoculation and anti-malarial study drugs&#xD;
      administration. Blood samples for safety evaluation, malaria monitoring, and red blood cell&#xD;
      antibodies will be drawn at screening and/or baseline and at nominated times after malaria&#xD;
      challenge.&#xD;

          -  Ingestion of any other drug, in the two weeks prior to dosing or during the blood&#xD;
             sampling period that, in the opinion of the Medical Investigator, could compromise the&#xD;
             study, e.g., through metabolic interactions, or analytical interference. However the&#xD;
             Medical Investigator may permit the use of paracetamol for the treatment of headache&#xD;
             or other pain. If drug therapy other than paracetamol or drug specified in the&#xD;
             protocol, is required during the study periods, a decision to continue or discontinue&#xD;
             the participant's participation will be made by the Medical Investigator, based on the&#xD;
             nature of the medication and the time the medication was taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Failure to conform to the requirements of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Detection of any drug listed in this protocol in the urine drug screen unless there is&#xD;
             an explanation acceptable to the medical investigator (e.g., the participant has&#xD;
             stated in advance that they consumed a prescription or OTC product which contained the&#xD;
             detected drug).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Vital signs outside the reference range and clinically significant.&#xD;

        <description>Seven to ten days after blood feeding, mosquitoes will be dissected to check for oocysts in midgut preparations. For permanent preparations, oocysts will be stained with 0.1% mercurochrome in PBS for 5 to 60 mins then fixed in 1%glutaraldehyde or formaldehyde. Oocysts will be counted per mosquito dissected and recorded. Relationship between parasitemia, gametocytemia and mosquito infection (both oocyst prevalence and intensity) will be determined using generalized-linear mixed models.

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The only disclosure restriction on the PI is that the sponsor can review results communications prior to public release and can embargo communications regarding trial results for a period that is less than or equal to 60 days. The sponsor cannot require changes to the communication and cannot extend the embargo.</restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>The adult mosquito mortality was high and blood feeding rates were low in these experiments, indicating an unhealthy mosquito colony. Transmission data from this group were therefore excluded from analysis.</limitations_and_caveats>
