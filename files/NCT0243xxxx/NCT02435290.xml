  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a cross-sectional study examining a random sample of in- and out-patients, with proven&#xD;
      malignant disease receiving chemotherapy, over a period of 6 months from the start of the&#xD;
      study who visit the Oncology department, Ain Shams University Teaching Hospitals. The effect&#xD;
      of some risk factors on the prescribing error will be studied; these risk factors include the&#xD;
      following: Tumor type ,Cancer stage ,type of comorbid illness ,type of medication , type of&#xD;
      anti-cancer treatment , number of abnormal lab data ,type of abnormal lab data , the number&#xD;
      of drugs in the treatment regimen , the number of side effects after chemotherapy&#xD;
      administration, the age of patient ,the dosing frequency of anticancer ,the route of&#xD;
      administration .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary statistics are performed to describe patient characteristics , frequency, types and&#xD;
      classification of medication error; and frequency with which Medication errors occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Logistic regression will be applied to the collected data to perform a predictive relation&#xD;
      between the risk factors which may be (categorical, continuous, or discrete) and the&#xD;
      prescribing errors which are (categorical).&#xD;

      This study will be performed according to the hospital's ethics board. Data on age, cancer&#xD;
      diagnosis, cancer stage, comorbid illness, details of the anticancer treatment, and drugs for&#xD;
      comorbid illness as well as any laboratory abnormalities will be collected.The data will be&#xD;
      collected from medical records review.Progress notes and changes made to patients' medication&#xD;
      orders since admission are reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drugs are classified as either &quot;active agents&quot; (defined as medications to treat cancer-&#xD;
      and/or therapy-related symptoms) or &quot;medications to treat comorbid conditions.&quot; A comorbid&#xD;
      illness is defined as a non-cancer clinical condition that required pharmacologic treatment .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prescribing errors will be classified as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incorrect Medication: Medication ordered was not appropriate for patient based on&#xD;
           indication, patient-specific variables, or clinical status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication Omission Error: patient having an indication for which no treatment or&#xD;
           inadequate treatment was prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose error: Under or over dosage of more than 5% of antineoplastic drugs .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose omission: unspecified dosage for the medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incorrect Treatment Duration: Medication prescribed without an appropriate stop time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Potential drug-drug interactions: a modification of the effect of a drug when&#xD;
           administered with another drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duplicate prescribing: two or more drugs from the same class are prescribed to treat the&#xD;
           same condition, or different conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Omitted or improper route of administration: unspecified route, wrong route, or improper&#xD;
           route to the patient clinical status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improper medication infusion rate: wrong infusion rate for medications administrated via&#xD;
           intravenous route.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prescribing errors will be identified utilizing:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical Oncology guidelines of Ain shams university hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. BC cancer agency (BCCA) cancer drug manual&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. .the web site chemocalculator (will be used to identify errors in dose calculation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4- .Drugs.com (used to identify drug-drug interaction, route of administration errors, dose&#xD;
      errors, and infusion rate errors).&#xD;
&#xD;
      5-- Manual search for chemotherapy prescribing errors articles via pubmed., and science&#xD;
      direct.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prescribing errors will be schemed into 3 levels according to their scientific evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Established: error confirmed by large clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Probable: error with high likelihood of occurrence but without definitive randomized&#xD;
           clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Suspect: error likely to occur; data derived from case reports. To confirm the&#xD;
           scientific evidence of the error, the investigators need to search BC Cancer Agency ,&#xD;
           pubmed, science direct and, medical journals literature to ensure the scientific&#xD;
           evidence of the error. Reporting medication errors of scientific evidence from 1 to 3 to&#xD;
           the physicians via e-mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ranking the severity of the prescribing errors ,in which major, when the potential error&#xD;
      could lead to permanent damage or risk of death; moderate, when the clinical consequence of&#xD;
      an error requires medical treatment; or minor, when small or no clinical effect is expected&#xD;
      from the error .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical pharmacist will discuss and study the effect of the following risk factors on&#xD;
      prescribing error:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The tumor type (breast cancer, lymphoma and myeloma ,lung cancer ,genitourinary cancer&#xD;
           ,gynecological cancer , GIT cancer, melanoma,head and neck cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cancer stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. early: indicates Carcinoma in situ&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. : locally- advanced: indicate more extensive disease: Larger tumor size and/or&#xD;
                spread of the cancer beyond the organ in which it first developed to nearby lymph&#xD;
                nodes and/or tissues or organs adjacent to the location of the primary tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. metastatic : indicates The cancer has spread to distant tissues or organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of comorbid illness (heart disease /renal disease /hepatic disease /diabetes/&#xD;
           hypertension / gastric disease/ blood abnormality/ osteoporosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The number of drugs in the treatment regimen .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of medication ( active agent ,comorbid illness medication )&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of anticancer treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The route of administration of chemotherapy (intravenous, intramuscular, Oral,&#xD;
           Intrathecal).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dosing Frequency of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The number of side effects of chemotherapy administrated experienced by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The number of abnormal lab data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The type of abnormal lab data (kidney function test ,liver function test ,blood test ).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The age of patient. Summary statistics of the data will be performed to determine the&#xD;
           incidence of prescribing errors in the oncology department of Ain shams university&#xD;
           hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Logistic regression analysis of the data will be performed using SPSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dependent variable is the presence or absence of prescribing error for which there is&#xD;
           reasonable supportive evidence (i.e., scientific evidence levels 1 - 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explanatory variables (risk factors) are age, cancer type, cancer stage, treatment type,&#xD;
           type of comorbid illness, number of drugs, type of medications, the number of laboratory&#xD;
           abnormality, type of lab abnormality the route of administration, the frequency of&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Logistic regression is used to model the determinants and predict the likelihood of the&#xD;
      prescribing errors in the oncology department, Ain shams university hospital. The impact&#xD;
      (coefficient) of each risk factor will be quantitatively correlated to prescribing errors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Charts will be performed to inform physicians of the prescribing errors of high incidence, as&#xD;
      well as, the risk factors increasing the likelihood of prescribing errors.&#xD;
