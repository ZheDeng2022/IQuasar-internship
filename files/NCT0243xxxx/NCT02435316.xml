  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized controlled, crossover trial comparing the effectiveness one&#xD;
      two curricular designs to teaching peripheral blood smears to residents.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      General Approach:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will employ a randomized, controlled design and will use as its outcomes two&#xD;
      separate post-tests, one after the first teaching session and one 4 weeks after the second&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design The investigators are attempting to find whether the combination of basic science&#xD;
      education using an 1-hour additive microskills- building method along with compare/ contrast&#xD;
      model versus a 1-hour traditional case-based format would improve performance on a visual&#xD;
      recognition test of hematology questions. A final test at 4 weeks after the cross-over&#xD;
      between the two groups will also help investigators analyze whether the order of exposure to&#xD;
      the teaching method would have an impact on the final performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling, including sample size and statistical power:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size will be between 40-50 resident physicians meeting inclusion criteria for the&#xD;
      study. There is not enough data in the literature to effectively determine power, so we will&#xD;
      use a convenience sample of the largest feasible group (around 40).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected on an excel spreadsheet and will be permanently de-identified on that&#xD;
      spreadsheet; it will be kept on a password-protected site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information management and analysis software:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be entered into a password protected excel spreadsheet and each study participant&#xD;
      will be assigned a unique identifier code which will be used to link the data. Statistical&#xD;
      analysis will be performed using SPSS version 20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data entry, editing and management, including handling of data collection forms, different&#xD;
      versions of data, and data storage and disposition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paper surveys and tests will be collected, recorded and locked; they will be destroyed 2&#xD;
      years after termination of the study. A paired t-test will be used to compare the two samples&#xD;
      means for significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality Control / Assurance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pretest and post-tests will be checked against a gold standard, a hospital board-certified&#xD;
      hematopathologist, to check the quality of the slides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bias in data collection, measurement and analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the small numbers of participants expected, a Type 1 error (failure to detect a&#xD;
      difference in groups when one exists) is possible, as the study will possibly be&#xD;
      underpowered.&#xD;

    <description>Primary outcome was an improvement in test score from pre-test to 2 and 4-week post-test. All participants took a 15-question pretest in addition to a posttest at 2 and 4 weeks. Each test consisted of pictures of various cell types from the peripheral blood.</description>
