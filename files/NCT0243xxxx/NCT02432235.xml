      This study evaluates camidanlumab tesirine in participants with relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      Non-Hodgkin or Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, first in human clinical study with camidanlumab tesirine to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability and pharmacokinetics of camidanlumab tesirine in participants with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Camidanlumab tesirine is a human monoclonal antibody attached via a cleavable linker to a&#xD;
      pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) warhead which, when internalized by antigen expressing cells,&#xD;
      covalently cross links deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) preventing replication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in 2 parts: Part 1 (dose escalation) and Part 2 (expansion).&#xD;

    <description>An assay determines the presence of anti-ADCT-301 antibodies in human serum using a validated bridging electro chemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) technique. The technique uses the drug itself to capture any anti ADCT-301 antibodies present in the serum. If anti-ADCT-301 antibodies are detected, they are confirmed to be specifically against ADCT-301 and then the level of the anti-ADCT-301 antibodies present in the serum is established using a modified version of the ECLIA technique.</description>

        <description>AI for HuMax-TAC, PBD-conjugated HuMax-TAC, and free warhead (SG3199). AI is the ratio of area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) from 0 to 21 days for Cycle 2 divided by AUC from 0 to 21 days for Cycle 1 (21 day cycle length). It is the increase in drug plasma concentration after multiple dosing until a steady state is reached.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Anti-drug Antibody Response (ADA) Against Camidanlumab Tesirine</title>
        <description>An assay determines the presence of anti-ADCT-301 antibodies in human serum using a validated bridging electro chemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) technique. The technique uses the drug itself to capture any anti ADCT-301 antibodies present in the serum. If anti-ADCT-301 antibodies are detected, they are confirmed to be specifically against ADCT-301 and then the level of the anti-ADCT-301 antibodies present in the serum is established using a modified version of the ECLIA technique.</description>

          <description>An assay determines the presence of anti-ADCT-301 antibodies in human serum using a validated bridging electro chemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) technique. The technique uses the drug itself to capture any anti ADCT-301 antibodies present in the serum. If anti-ADCT-301 antibodies are detected, they are confirmed to be specifically against ADCT-301 and then the level of the anti-ADCT-301 antibodies present in the serum is established using a modified version of the ECLIA technique.</description>
