    <textblock>
      Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), is where human immunodeficiency virus type 1&#xD;
      (HIV-1) appears to have most diversified. The factors that lead to jumpstarting the HIV-1&#xD;
      epidemic remain unclear; mounting evidence suggests medical interventions may have&#xD;
      contributed. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) are&#xD;
      viruses compatible with long-term survival but with broadly similar modes of transmission as&#xD;
      HIV. The main objective was to assess the association of past intravenous treatment with HCV&#xD;
      and HTLV-1 seropositivity. The investigators hypothesized that medical interventions in the&#xD;
      mid-20th century may have facilitated the emergence of HIV-1 in central Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the association of injectable treatments with HCV and HTLV-1 infection and to&#xD;
      reconstruct past virus dynamics, the investigators conducted a cross-sectional study of 839&#xD;
      elderly long-term inhabitants of Kinshasa, with serological assays followed by amplification&#xD;
      and sequencing. Risk factors were assessed through logistic regression. Phylogenetic methods&#xD;
      were used to reconstruct the epidemic history of HCV.&#xD;

      1. Background&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1 The emergence of HIV&#xD;
&#xD;
           The HIV/AIDS pandemic has so far caused about 29 million deaths, while 33 million&#xD;
           individuals currently live with HIV. Even if this will have no direct impact on the&#xD;
           future course of the epidemic, it is important to try to understand the factors that&#xD;
           allowed the successful emergence of HIV-1, first as a moral obligation towards the&#xD;
           victims, and then to draw lessons that could ultimately help mankind avoid facing&#xD;
           similar threats in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
           There is now no doubt that the source of HIV-1 group M (the strain causing the pandemic)&#xD;
           is the Pan troglodytes troglodytes chimpanzee of central Africa. This primate inhabits&#xD;
           south Cameroon, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, the Congo Republic, the south-west of the&#xD;
           Central African Republic (CAR), the Cabinda enclave and a small part of the Democratic&#xD;
           Republic of Congo (DRC) (the Mayombe area north of the river). It is thought that the&#xD;
           original cross-species transmission, from chimpanzee to man, occurred around the&#xD;
           beginning of the 20th century, probably through the manipulation of chimpanzee meat by a&#xD;
           hunter or a cook, so that the common ancestor of group M existed in humans around&#xD;
           1910-1920. It is extremely unlikely that this very first infected human lived in the&#xD;
           DRC, where populations of Pan troglodytes troglodytes were very small. The virus then&#xD;
           slowly disseminated along trading routes, eventually reaching Léopoldville and&#xD;
           Brazzaville no later than 1959.&#xD;
&#xD;
           It is in this large bi-national conurbation that the virus managed to flourish and&#xD;
           diversify, as supported by several findings:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The broadest genetic diversity of HIV-1 is found in Kinshasa and Brazzaville. All&#xD;
                HIV-1 subtypes and many recombinants have been found there. Indeed, the genetic&#xD;
                diversity of HIV-1 in Kinshasa in the mid-1980s, twenty-five years ago, was higher&#xD;
                than that currently found in any other part of the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The two most ancient isolates of HIV-1 have been located in Kinshasa, one from a&#xD;
                blood sample obtained in 1959 and the second from a lymph node biopsy obtained in&#xD;
                1960.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Testing of serum collections stored for years showed that among mothers bringing&#xD;
                their children to an under-five clinic in the Lemba district of Kinshasa, HIV&#xD;
                prevalence was 0.25% in 1970 and 3.0% in 1980.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. HIV prevalence among the general adult population of Kinshasa and Brazzaville in&#xD;
                the mid-1980s was already between 5 and 8%, while it was far lower in Yaoundé,&#xD;
                Douala and Libreville, the other large cities of central Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Several serologically proven cases of AIDS were diagnosed retrospectively among&#xD;
                Belgian nationals who were probably infected in the Congo in the 1960s.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The question that remains is to understand the factors that facilitated the emergence of&#xD;
           HIV-1 within this population in the middle of the 20th century (and not elsewhere). For&#xD;
           a long time, this has been attributed essentially to the urbanisation of central Africa.&#xD;
           The colonialists created cities in which adult men by far outnumbered women, leading to&#xD;
           the development of urban prostitution, so that eventually HIV-1 encountered conditions&#xD;
           that were propitious for its sexual spread, initially among prostitutes and their&#xD;
           clients, along the lines of what was later to be documented in Nairobi in the 1980s.&#xD;
&#xD;
           It is indeed very likely that prostitution ultimately played a substantial role in the&#xD;
           emergence of HIV-1 in Kinshasa/Brazzaville. However, for a long period of time,&#xD;
           prostitution in these two cities was rather of a &quot;soft&quot;, low-risk, type: free women&#xD;
           (ndumbas) had 3-4 regular clients, to whom they provided not just sex but diversified&#xD;
           services (cooking, laundry, hair dressing, having a conversation) in exchange for&#xD;
           regular financial support rather than a fixed fee per intercourse. High-risk&#xD;
           prostitution, in which women could have sex with 3-4 different clients every day, up to&#xD;
           a thousand per year, appeared only circa 1960, around new venues called flamingos, bars&#xD;
           with rudimentary rooms nearby, in the context of the profound social and economic&#xD;
           changes prompted by the country's accession to independence.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For several years we have been investigating the possibility that some of the early&#xD;
           expansion of HIV occurred through well-intentioned medical interventions. For a long&#xD;
           time, because the early pharmaceutical products were poorly effective, drugs for the&#xD;
           treatment of tropical and other infectious diseases had to be administered&#xD;
           intravenously, through syringes and needles that were continuously re-utilised and&#xD;
           poorly sterilized, potentially allowing the transmission of blood-borne viruses. This&#xD;
           risk could not be appreciated at the time, initially because the existence of such&#xD;
           viruses was unknown, but also because acute infection with the Hepatitis C virus (HCV)&#xD;
           generally caused only a mild non-specific disease, while most adults had already been&#xD;
           infected with the Hepatitis B virus (HBV) during childhood, so that they were immune by&#xD;
           the time they received treatments against tropical diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In Egypt, millions were infected with HCV during interventions for the control of&#xD;
           schistosomiasis, demonstrating that iatrogenic epidemics can indeed reach a massive&#xD;
           scale. In a community-based study of elderly individuals in Guinea-Bissau, we showed&#xD;
           that the HIV-2 epidemic might also have been largely iatrogenic, through the treatment&#xD;
           of African trypanosomiasis and the parenteral treatment of tuberculosis with&#xD;
           intramuscular streptomycin (augmented by transmission during ritual excision of the&#xD;
           clitoris in collective ceremonies), which contributed to the emergence of this other&#xD;
           simian-turned-human retrovirus 40 to 50 years ago. This latter study was possible&#xD;
           because HIV-2 increases mortality only 2 to 3-fold, in contrast with HIV-1 which&#xD;
           enhances mortality 10-fold.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We hypothesized that the same medical interventions, or others based on the mass&#xD;
           administration of parenteral drugs, may also have facilitated, at roughly the same time,&#xD;
           the emergence of HIV-1 in central Africa. Because of the high mortality associated with&#xD;
           HIV-1 infection, it is not possible to examine this hypothesis directly. However, HCV&#xD;
           and HTLV-1 (viruses compatible with a prolonged survival) infections can be used as&#xD;
           markers for the parenteral transmission of viruses, to determine indirectly whether&#xD;
           those interventions may have contributed to the emergence of HIV-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We then conducted two epidemiological studies of elderly individuals (aged 55-60 years&#xD;
           or more) in central Africa. In Ebolowa, south Cameroon, where more than half of the&#xD;
           elderly are HCV-seropositive, HCV seropositivity was associated mainly with the&#xD;
           intravenous treatment of malaria with quinine, and also with traditional circumcision of&#xD;
           boys in group ceremonies. In the Nola region of southwest CAR, HCV seropositivity was&#xD;
           associated with the treatment of African trypanosomiasis before 1950, while HTLV-1&#xD;
           infection was associated with prophylactic injections of pentamidine (for the prevention&#xD;
           of trypanosomiasis, between 1947 and 1953) and with transfusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In this context, it would be relevant to try to assess whether parenteral transmission&#xD;
           might have played a role in the emergence of HIV-1 in Kinshasa half a century ago, using&#xD;
           the same two proxies, HCV and HTLV-1 infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 Hepatitis C virus infection in central Africa&#xD;
&#xD;
           Africa is the continent with the highest HCV prevalence among its adult population. In&#xD;
           central Africa, 6% of adults are HCV-seropositive, compared to 2.4% in West Africa and&#xD;
           1.6% in eastern and southern Africa3. In many areas of central Africa, HCV prevalence&#xD;
           increases steeply with age, far beyond what could be expected from cumulative exposure&#xD;
           over time. Since there is only a modest heterosexual and vertical transmission of HCV,&#xD;
           it has generally been thought that most of this transmission occurred parenterally,&#xD;
           through injections, transfusions, immunizations and scarifications. It is now known that&#xD;
           the parenteral transmission of HCV is rather ineffective unless the needle had first&#xD;
           been inserted in the vein of a viremic individual. This was the mechanism that drove the&#xD;
           massive epidemic in Egypt, where a large number of individuals were infected in the&#xD;
           early 1960s during campaigns for the control of schistosomiasis through the intravenous&#xD;
           injections of antimonial drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In sub-Saharan Africa, Cameroon is the country where the epidemiology of HCV has been&#xD;
           most thoroughly investigated. Several studies documented a high HCV prevalence, in&#xD;
           Yaoundé but also in many rural southern communities. A synthesis of these studies&#xD;
           demonstrated a cohort effect: in many areas, HCV prevalence was 40-50% amongst&#xD;
           individuals born before 1945, progressively decreasing to 15% for those born around 1960&#xD;
           and only 3-4% for those born after 1970. In several Cameroonian studies, HCV prevalence&#xD;
           peaked in cohorts corresponding to dates of birth around 1935. Furthermore, molecular&#xD;
           clock analyses revealed that the number of Cameroonians infected with HCV started&#xD;
           increasing exponentially around 1920 for genotype 4, and around 1940 for genotypes 1 and&#xD;
           2. Since other modes of transmission are rather ineffective, this implies a massive&#xD;
           iatrogenic transmission of the virus in the last few decades of the colonial era. As&#xD;
           mentioned, in one of these high-prevalence communities, the administration of&#xD;
           intravenous antimalarials was the main risk factor for HCV infection. It follows that if&#xD;
           the HCV blood-borne virus was massively transmitted during medical interventions in&#xD;
           several areas inhabited by the Pan troglodytes troglodytes chimpanzee, the same&#xD;
           amplification might have occurred with SIVcpz which eventually became HIV-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the DRC, HCV prevalence has been measured in only one study. Among Kinshasa sex&#xD;
           workers, HCV prevalence increased with age and reached 21% in those aged 41-55 years. As&#xD;
           the sexual transmission of HCV is rather ineffective, this prevalence must have&#xD;
           reflected to some extent the prevalence in the general adult population. Among pregnant&#xD;
           women aged 31-55 years, HCV prevalence was only 5.6% but one can presume that few of&#xD;
           them were aged more than 40 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that the intravenous treatments of various infectious diseases with poorly&#xD;
      sterilized syringes and needles contributed to the transmission of HCV and HTLV-1 within the&#xD;
      city of Kinshasa in the middle of the 20th century, and that this could have as well&#xD;
      facilitated the early emergence of HIV-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to determine whether HCV seropositivity (primary outcome) is associated with past&#xD;
           intravenous treatments against tropical and other diseases, especially during the&#xD;
           pre-1980 period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to reconstruct the past dynamics of HCV in Kinshasa through molecular clock methods&#xD;
           based on the sequencing of local HCV isolates obtained from elderly individuals and&#xD;
           determine the period during which maximal transmission of this blood-borne virus&#xD;
           occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to determine whether the same medical interventions were associated with the&#xD;
           transmission of HTLV-1 (secondary outcome).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to contribute to a better understanding of the epidemiology of HCV and HTLV-1 infections&#xD;
           in the DRC.&#xD;

      two main outcomes (HCV and HTLV-1 infections), serological assays were performed as detailed&#xD;
      in Web extra material, Appendix. For HCV, PCR amplification of the NS5b (485-nt) and core/E1&#xD;

        We will attempt to recruit into this cross-sectional study participants aged 70 years or&#xD;
        more living in various districts of Kinshasa. According to countrywide demographic data,&#xD;
        1.4% of the Congolese population is aged 70 years or more.40 Assuming that the population&#xD;
        of Kinshasa is around 8 million, and that the proportion of elderly is similar to that of&#xD;
        the whole country, there could be within the capital approximately 112.000 residents aged&#xD;
        70 years or more. As we are interested in documenting the mechanisms of virus transmission&#xD;
        within the city itself, we will enrol only individuals who have lived in Kinshasa for at&#xD;
        least 35 years.&#xD;
