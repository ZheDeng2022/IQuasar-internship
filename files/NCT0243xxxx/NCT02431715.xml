  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are a group of neoplasms generally arising from the&#xD;
      gastroenteropancreatic tract. They are usually slow growing, have low malignant potential,&#xD;
      and often go unnoticed until they become metastatic. The correct treatment approach is&#xD;
      dependent on the extent of the disease, however surgical approaches and systemic therapy can&#xD;
      be curative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combined positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) using the radiotracer&#xD;
      18F-6-L-fluorodihydroxyphenylalanine (18F-FDOPA) has been shown to be a promising&#xD;
      non-invasive technique to help localizing NETs and guide their treatment.&#xD;

      Purpose/Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to provide access to 18F-6-L fluorodihydroxyphenylalanine&#xD;
      (18F-FDOPA) positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging to patients&#xD;
      with neuroendocrine tumours (NET) and to collect additional data about the effectiveness of&#xD;
      18F-DOPA PET/CT in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The overall accuracy of 18F-FDOPA PET/CT is superior to conventional imaging techniques&#xD;
           for the detection of neuroendocrine tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The sensitivity of 18F-FDOPA PET/CT is superior to conventional imaging techniques for&#xD;
           the detection of neuroendocrine tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of NET's depends on the extent of disease and rate of tumour progression. Accurate&#xD;
      staging is critical to establish the prognosis of the disease, to guide potentially curative&#xD;
      surgical approaches and to assist in therapeutic decision making between surgery,&#xD;
      embolization techniques and systemic therapy. Standard radiologic and nuclear medicine&#xD;
      techniques all have significant limitations in terms of their ability to detect these lesions&#xD;
      and to evaluate response to treatment. The widely used PET tracer 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose&#xD;
      (18-FDG) is of limited value in NET's due to its non-specific uptake and the relatively low&#xD;
      mitotic rate often seen in these tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combined PET/CTutilizing 18F-FDOPA has been investigated as a potentially sensitive and&#xD;
      specific staging and localization technique for NETs. Expression of tumour-specific&#xD;
      catecholamine transport and storage mechanisms by NET cells is the basis of 18F-DOPA PET&#xD;
      imaging. Cellular uptake and radiopharmaceutical concentration in intracellular storage&#xD;
      granules within tumour cells of neuroendocrine origin and differentiation, combined with the&#xD;
      high sensitivity, resolution and accurate anatomic localization of PET/CT imaging, makes&#xD;
      18F-DOPA PET/CT potentially superior to standard nuclear medicine and radiologic techniques&#xD;
      for the detection and localization of functioning and non-functioning NETs. This imaging&#xD;
      technique not only provides specific functional and biochemical information via PET images,&#xD;
      but also morphological and anatomical detail via CT images leading to more accurate&#xD;
      localization and characterization on individual lesions. This may allow better treatment&#xD;
      planning as well as restaging during and after therapy to assess disease response. The&#xD;
      information retrieved from the hybrid 18F-FDOPA PET/CT could have a profound influence on&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment of patients with NETs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be an expanded access study in which adult and pediatric subjects will be invited&#xD;
      to participate. All subjects are informed of anticipated effects (none) and purpose of the&#xD;
      injected substance. Subjects are approached by their treating physicians with respect to&#xD;
      their willingness to participate in the proposed study based on clinical criteria. They will&#xD;
      then undergo a brief clinical assessment followed by the PET/CT scanning protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BC Cancer Agency anticipates a start date in August 2012 and a potential completion date&#xD;
      August of 2017. Three full years of data collection will provide meaningful numbers for&#xD;
      analysis. A total of 300 patients, including adults and pediatric patients, will be recruited&#xD;
      for the study. This number is based on the anticipated number of PET scan referrals expected&#xD;
      over a five-year study timeframe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes will be estimates of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 18F-DOPA&#xD;
      PET. 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for all estimates. Outcomes will be&#xD;
      estimated for the whole study population and for different types of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity (ratio of true positive lesions to total positive lesions), specificity (ratio of&#xD;
      true negative lesions to total negative lesions) and accuracy (ratio of total correct studies&#xD;
      to the total number of biopsied lesions) of 18F-FDOPA PET studies performed by the BCCA will&#xD;
      be obtained by comparing results of the PET scan with the gold-standard of histopathological&#xD;
      diagnosis when those results are available (as determined by clinical indication and&#xD;
      feasibility by the treating physician) and results of conventional imaging. Biopsy of lesions&#xD;
      is not mandated by this study. Confidence intervals (95% CI) for sensitivity, specificity and&#xD;
      accuracy will be calculated using exact binomial distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will be compared to figures in the published literature. All analyses will be&#xD;
      performed in direct consultation with a statistician who is a member of the BC Cancer Agency&#xD;
      staff.&#xD;

    <description>All patients will have their weight and baseline vital signs recorded.&#xD;
The study subject will have an intravenous catheter inserted and receive a slow bolus intravenous dose of 185 - 370 MBq (5 -10mCi) 18F-FDOPA.&#xD;
The patient will rest in a comfortable reclining chair in a warm, private shielded room for 45 to 60 minutes.&#xD;
Patients are positioned supine and centered on the scanner bed for an average total scan time (CT and PET) of approximately 30 minutes.&#xD;
Images will be interpreted by qualified and experienced physicians. Findings of significance from the PET/CT scan, and any incidental findings of significance from the CT scan, will be included in the single final report that will be issued to referring physicians.</description>
