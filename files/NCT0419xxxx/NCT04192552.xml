      The proposed PAUSE-2 RCT study is the logical next step to the Perioperative Anticoagulant&#xD;
      Use for Surgery Evaluation (PAUSE) study, which was completed on August 31, 2018. Both&#xD;
      studies address the perioperative management of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who&#xD;
      are receiving a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) and require an elective surgery/procedure.&#xD;
      PAUSE did not address safe management of patients having a high-bleed-risk surgery/neuraxial&#xD;
      anesthesia in whom there is concern about bleeding, especially neuraxial-related epidural&#xD;
      hematomas that can lead to paralysis; such patients are often managed by the approach&#xD;
      recommended by the American Society of Regional Anesthesia (ASRA). In PAUSE-2, investigators&#xD;
      will test the hypothesis: (i) for patients having a high-bleed-risk surgery/neuraxial&#xD;
      anesthesia, the simpler &quot;PAUSE management&quot; is as safe (non-inferior) to the more complex&#xD;
      &quot;ASRA management&quot;. PAUSE-2 will establish a standard for perioperative DOAC management in&#xD;
      patients having high-bleed-risk surgery or neuraxial anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To start, this will be a pilot study of a larger PAUSE-2-RCT. The investigators will be&#xD;
      conducting this pilot study to assess the feasibility of the study at this smaller scale.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The proposed PAUSE-2 RCT study is the logical next step to the Perioperative Anticoagulant&#xD;
      Use for Surgery Evaluation (PAUSE) study, which was completed on August 31, 2018 and&#xD;
      presented at the American Society of Hematology Conference on December 4, 2018. Both studies&#xD;
      address the perioperative management of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who are&#xD;
      receiving a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) (apixaban, dabigatran or rivaroxaban) and&#xD;
      require an elective surgery/procedure. Standardized, DOAC-specific perioperative management&#xD;
      is needed to: (i) minimize patient harm related to serious perioperative adverse events,&#xD;
      comprising arterial thromboembolism (A-TE) and major bleeding (MB); and (ii) allow&#xD;
      consistent, cost-efficient management that avoids cancelled surgeries/procedures and the need&#xD;
      to reverse DOACs. PAUSE did not address safe management of patients having a high-bleed-risk&#xD;
      surgery/neuraxial anesthesia in whom there is concern about bleeding, especially&#xD;
      neuraxial-related epidural hematomas that can lead to paralysis; such patients are often&#xD;
      managed by the approach recommended by the American Society of Regional Anesthesia (ASRA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In PAUSE-2, the primary question is: (i) In patients having a high-bleed-risk&#xD;
      surgery/neuraxial anesthesia, is the simple, shorter-DOAC-interruption PAUSE management as&#xD;
      safe as the more complex, longer-interruption ASRA approach? Hypothesis: PAUSE management is&#xD;
      non-inferior to ASRA management with expected perioperative risks in both groups of 2.5% for&#xD;
      MB (2% non-inferiority margin) and 0.5% for A-TE (1% non-inferiority margin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In PAUSE-2, the secondary question is: (i) are the PAUSE and ASRA management approaches&#xD;
      associated with similar proportions of patients with minimal-to-no residual DOAC levels at&#xD;
      surgery, and similar adherence to the DOAC interruption/resumption protocols? Exploratory&#xD;
      postulate: PAUSE and ASRA approaches will have similar proportion of patients (±5%) with DOAC&#xD;
      levels (&lt;30, 30-49.9, and ≥50 ng/mL), and protocol adherence to perioperative DOACs&#xD;
      interrupted and resumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 201 patients will be recruited for the PAUSE-2 Study pilot. This is 10% of the&#xD;
      proposed main study (2,010 participants).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all patients, a 5 mL blood sample will be taken just before surgery (but will be not&#xD;
      available for clinical use and cannot be used for genetic testing). Plasma will be frozen and&#xD;
      stored at each clinical site before shipment to the core laboratory at McMaster University&#xD;
      for storage and standardized DOAC level measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A focused patient enrolled before the procedure and followed up every week up to completion&#xD;
      of their participation at 4 weeks (±5 days). Patients will be enrolled over a 1 year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To start, this will be a pilot study of a larger PAUSE-2-RCT. Conducting this pilot study&#xD;
      will help assess the feasibility and methodology of the study at this smaller scale. It is&#xD;
      important to evaluate the feasibility of recruitment, randomization and retention. As well,&#xD;
      investigators need to assess the methodology and implementation of the randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note that the outcome for the pilot study is not to evaluate the safety of the perioperative&#xD;
      procedure, but to examine the approach to be used in the intended larger study. The outcomes&#xD;
      for the larger study will still be collected.&#xD;
