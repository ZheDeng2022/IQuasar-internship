      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of doping, there is controversy regarding the beneficial effects of β2-agonists like&#xD;
      salmeterol on physical performance. Some studies show improvement with salmeterol&#xD;
      administered orally, especially related to pulmonary function and muscle contractibility,&#xD;
      while other works do not show such ergogenic effects of salmeterol by inhalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supratherapeutic use of salmeterol is prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency, but a&#xD;
      maximum allowed urine concentration has not been determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine concentrations of salmeterol are very low when administered at therapeutic doses, often&#xD;
      below the lower limit of quantification. Some studies show that urine concentrations of&#xD;
      α-hydroxy-salmeterol (the principal salmeterol metabolite) may be higher than those of the&#xD;
      original drug. Thus, α-hydroxy-salmeterol might be a more suitable biomarker for detecting&#xD;
      fraudulent use of this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inhaled administration of salmeterol in healthy subjects allows obtaining positive urine&#xD;
      samples that will be used to identify analytical strategies for doping detection. Salmeterol&#xD;
      concentrations and its metabolites (α-hydroxy-salmeterol and others) can be measured in&#xD;
      urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To generate urine samples positive to salmeterol in order to be analyzed&#xD;
      as control samples by anti-doping laboratories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: To identify salmeterol metabolites (α-hydroxy-salmeterol and others) in&#xD;
      urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I, open, non-randomized, uncontrolled clinical trial, with a treatment condition&#xD;
      (salmeterol) administered daily by inhalation to 6 subjects during 3 consecutive days.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male volunteers aged between 18 and 45 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to understand and accept the trial procedures and able to sign an informed&#xD;
             consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History and physical examination that demonstrate not presenting organic or&#xD;
             psychiatric disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECG, blood and urine tests performed at screening should be within normal limits.&#xD;
             Minor or punctual variations of these limits of normality are admitted if, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the Principal Investigator, they have no clinical significance, do not pose&#xD;
             a risk to the subject and do not interfere with the evaluation of the product in&#xD;
             study. These variations and their non-relevance will be justified in writing&#xD;
             specifically.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Having donated blood during the month prior to the start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Having suffered an organic disease or major surgery in the three months prior to the&#xD;

             Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), renal, hepatic, endocrine, gastrointestinal,&#xD;
             hematological, neurological, dermatological or other acute or chronic diseases that,&#xD;
             in the opinion of the Principal Investigator or the collaborators designated by him,&#xD;

             alter the pharmacokinetics of the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have taken medication regularly in the month prior to the study sessions, with the&#xD;
             exception of vitamins, herbal remedies or dietary supplements that, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the Principal Investigator or the collaborators designated by him, do not pose a risk&#xD;
             to the subjects and do not interfere with the objectives of the study. Treatment with&#xD;
             single doses of symptomatic medication in the week prior to the study sessions will&#xD;
             not be exclusive if it is assumed that medication has been completely eliminated on&#xD;
