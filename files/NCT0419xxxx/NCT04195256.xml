  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Orthopedic injuries comprise more than 10% of ED visits in children and 25 to 50% of children&#xD;
      will sustain a fracture before age 16 years. Distal radius fractures account for 20-32% of&#xD;
      fractures in children, making them the most common fracture type. Between 20 and 40% of&#xD;
      extremity fractures in children require a closed reduction, often necessitating procedural&#xD;
      sedation and analgesia (PSA). Intravenous (IV) ketamine is the most commonly used sedative&#xD;
      agent used to perform a closed reduction. However, children rate IV insertion as the most&#xD;
      painful hospital experience, second only to the injury itself. IV insertion can be more&#xD;
      technically difficult in children because of smaller veins and lack of cooperation, often&#xD;
      leading to multiple IV attempts. A combination of intranasal (IN) dexmedetomidine plus&#xD;
      ketamine (IN Ketodex) may provide effective sedation for children undergoing a closed&#xD;
      reduction without the distress and pain related to IV insertion. A less painful experience&#xD;
      has been found to correlate with child satisfaction which may reduce caregiver anxiety and&#xD;
      improve the therapeutic relationship with the health care team. This study is a multi-centre,&#xD;
      two-arm, randomized, blinded, controlled, non-inferiority trial designed to test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that IN Ketodex is non-inferior to intravenous (IV) ketamine with respect to depth&#xD;
      of sedation as measured using the Pediatrics Sedation State Scale (PSSS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intranasal medications may offer a technically easier and pain-free approach to procedural&#xD;
      sedation (PSA); one that may have widespread applicability in patients with needle-phobia,&#xD;
      difficult IV access, resource-limited settings, or when experience placing an IV is limited.&#xD;
      Although IN ketamine has been found to be effective for fracture pain, procedural pain,&#xD;
      anesthetic pre-induction, and diagnostic imaging, a recent shortage of this agent in the&#xD;
      highest concentration of 100 mg/mL has severely limited out ability to study its&#xD;
      effectiveness and consequent clinical uptake. Our research team conducted three systematic&#xD;
      reviews of randomized trials of IN ketamine and IN dexmedetomidine in children undergoing&#xD;
      painful procedures. The latter review included 18 trials (n=2128) of children age 1 month to&#xD;
      14 years. Our review found that IN dexmedetomidine, dosed from 1-4 mcg/kg, was well tolerated&#xD;
      and superior to conventional sedatives (midazolam and chloral hydrate) in providing adequate&#xD;
      sedation to 525/669 (78.5%) children. A number of studies found that IN dexmedetomidine was&#xD;
      in fact superior to IN ketamine. Surendar et al. found that IN dexmedetomidine at 1.5 mcg/kg&#xD;
      facilitated successful sedation in 18/21 (86%) of children undergoing dental procedures and&#xD;
      was more effective than IN ketamine 5 mg/kg. Gyanesh et al. found that the proportion of&#xD;
      children with satisfactory IV sedation was greater with IN dexmedetomidine 1 mcg/kg compared&#xD;
      to IN ketamine 5 mg/kg [47/52 (90%) versus 43/52 (83%), respectively]. Mostafa et al. found&#xD;
      that IN dexmedetomidine 1 mcg/kg was more effective at facilitating caregiver separation than&#xD;
      IN ketamine 5 mg/kg or IN midazolam 0.2 mg/kg [30/32 (92%) versus 22/32 (69%) versus 28/32&#xD;
      (88%), respectively]. Moreover, a combination of dexmedetomidine and ketamine appeared to be&#xD;
      superior than either agent alone. Qiao et al. found that IN dexmedetomidine 2 mcg/kg and oral&#xD;
      ketamine 3 mg/kg in children undergoing IV insertion was superior to both IN dexmedetomidine&#xD;
      2.5 mcg/kg and oral ketamine 6 mg/kg alone (80.1% versus 47.6% versus 68.3%, respectively).&#xD;
      Bhat et al. found that a combination of IN dexmedetomidine 1 mcg/kg and IN ketamine 2 mg/kg&#xD;
      versus IN dexmedetomidine 1 mcg/kg alone facilitated greater acceptance of face mask (67%&#xD;
      versus 52%, respectively) and greater tolerance of caregiver separation (93% versus 89%,&#xD;
      respectively) (38). We also found evidence that higher doses of IN dexmedetomidine were more&#xD;
      effective. More specifically, at the higher end of the dosing range (1-4 mcg/kg), IN&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine 3 mcg/kg was superior to IN ketamine 7 mg/kg; providing adequate sedation to&#xD;
      25/29 (86.3%) versus 23/29 (79.4%) of children undergoing IV insertion, respectively. A&#xD;
      dose-finding study of IN dexmedetomidine in children &lt; 3 years who were post-operative from&#xD;
      cardiac surgery and were undergoing transthoracic echocardiography found an optimal median&#xD;
      effective dose of 3.3 mcg/kg (range 2.72-3.78 mcg/kg). Taken together, our review suggests&#xD;
      that the most effective and tolerable intranasal agent for procedural sedation for fracture&#xD;
      reduction is a combination of IN dexmedetomidine 4 mcg/kg and IN ketamine 2-3 mg/kg. There is&#xD;
      ample and ongoing evidence of suboptimal management for procedural pain in children, a high&#xD;
      frequency of orthopedic injuries requiring IV placement for PSA, and a lack of evidence to&#xD;
      support the use of strategies that reduce the pain of IVs. However, there are no studies that&#xD;
      have shown the effectiveness of IN ketamine for fracture reduction in children. In order to&#xD;
      provide robust evidence supporting an alternate approach that precludes the need for an IV in&#xD;
      children undergoing PSA, the investigators propose a study to answer the important research&#xD;
      question: In children presenting to the ED with an orthopedic injury requiring PSA, does IN&#xD;
      Ketodex provide as effective sedation as IV ketamine?&#xD;
