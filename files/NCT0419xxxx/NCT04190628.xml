      This is a Phase I, First-In-Human, open label, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary anti-cancer activity of ABM-1310 in adult&#xD;
      patients with documented BRAF V600 mutation and locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors&#xD;
      who have no effective standard treatment options available, as monotherapy in Part A, or in&#xD;
      combination with cobimetinib (Cotellic®) in Part B in adult patients who also have documented&#xD;
      progressive disease or intolerance to previous combination treatment of BRAF and MEK&#xD;
      inhibitors. The primary objective of this study is to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose&#xD;
      (MTD) and/or the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) of both single agent and combination&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study consists of two Parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: The starting dose of ABM-1310 is 25 mg po bid, and dose escalation will be guided by&#xD;
      a &quot;3+3&quot; design. ABM-1310 will be administered twice daily on a continuous schedule. Each&#xD;
      treatment cycle consists of 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: The starting dose of ABM-1310 will be a dose below the MTD that has been demonstrated&#xD;
      to be safe in Part A Monotherapy. A classic &quot;3+3&quot; design will guide the dose escalation. At&#xD;
      each dose level, ABM-1310 will be administered in combination with 60 mg cobimetinib&#xD;
      (Cotellic ®) once daily (qd) for the first 21 days of each 28-day treatment cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be evaluated and managed per the pre-defined DLT criteria&#xD;
      and rules specified in the protocol. MTD and/or RP2D will be confirmed in a dose confirmation&#xD;
      cohort.&#xD;
