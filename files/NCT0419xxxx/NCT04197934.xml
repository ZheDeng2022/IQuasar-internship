      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of WSD0922-FU for the treatment of&#xD;
      glioblastoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, or non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to the&#xD;
      central nervous system (central nervous system metastases). WSD0922-FU is a targeted&#xD;
      treatment which blocks the EGFR protein - a strategy that has led to a lot of benefit in&#xD;
      patients with many different cancers. WSD0922-FU may also be able to get into cancers in the&#xD;
      brain and spinal cord and help patients with brain and spinal cord cancers.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D)&#xD;
      of EGFR/EGFRvIII inhibitor WSD0922-FU (WSD0922-FU) in subjects with recurrent glioblastoma,&#xD;
      IDH wildtype (GBM), anaplastic astrocytoma, IDH wildtype (AA) and central nervous system&#xD;
      (CNS) metastases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) related to&#xD;
      WSD0922-FU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess anti-tumor activity: intracranial and extracranial overall response rate (ORR),&#xD;
      and change in tumor size compared with baseline according to Response Assessment in&#xD;
      Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria for GBM/AA and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
      (RECIST) 1.1 for NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess anti-tumor activity: intracranial and extracranial disease control rate (DCR)&#xD;
      and change in tumor size compared with baseline according to RANO criteria for GBM/AA and&#xD;
      RECIST 1.1 for NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess anti-tumor activity: intracranial and extracranial duration of response (DOR)&#xD;
      and change in tumor size compared with baseline according to RANO criteria for GBM/AA and&#xD;
      RECIST 1.1 for NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess anti-tumor activity: intracranial and extracranial progression-free survival&#xD;
      (PFS) and change in tumor size compared with baseline according to RANO criteria for GBM/AA&#xD;
      and RECIST 1.1 for NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY/CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To investigate the presence and/or identity of the drug metabolites of WSD0922-FU, and the&#xD;
      concentrations of these in the plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess plasma concentration of WSD0922-FU and metabolite SN16110801P1 and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters after single and multiple doses of WSD0922-FU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the brain tumor pharmacokinetics of WSD0922-FU and SN16110801P1 after a single&#xD;
      dose of WSD0922-FU (Dose Expansion - Brain tumor penetration [BTP] cohort only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration of WSD0922-FU and SN16110801P1 after&#xD;
      multiple doses of WSD0922-FU (Dose Expansion - NSCLC leptomeningeal metastases [NSCLC LM]&#xD;
      cohort only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To explore the impact of tumor markers (e.g. MGMT promoter methylation, EGFR mutation&#xD;
      [including EGFR vIII], PTEN deletion, TP53 mutation, etc.) on clinical parameters associated&#xD;
      with WSD0922-FU treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To evaluate and measure pharmacodynamic biomarkers of inhibition of EGFR and downstream&#xD;
      signals in tumor samples after a single dose of WSD0922-FU (Dose Expansion Cohort - BTP&#xD;
      cohort only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To evaluate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of single dose of WSD0922-FU in&#xD;
      plasma (Dose Expansion - NSCLC LM cohort only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOSE ESCALATION: Patients receive WSD0922-FU orally (PO) once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID)&#xD;
      on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOSE EXPANSION: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT I: Patients with GBM/AA receive WSD0922-FU PO BID on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28&#xD;
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT II: Patients with BTP receive a single dose of WSD0922-FU prior to surgery. Patients&#xD;
      then undergo surgical resection of brain tumor. After surgery, patients receive WSD0922-FU PO&#xD;
      BID on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT III: Patients with NSCLC LM receive WSD0922-FU PO on days 1 and 4 of cycle 0. Patients&#xD;
      then receive WSD0922-FU PO BID on days 1-28 of subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 28 days&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4-6 weeks, then every 2&#xD;
      months until progressive disease, at progressive disease, and then every 3 months after&#xD;
      progressive disease for up to 5 years.&#xD;

    <description>The overall response rate will be defined as the number of patients with a partial response (PR) or better that is confirmed in consecutive evaluations (at least 8 weeks apart) divided by the total number of evaluable patients.

    <description>Duration of response is defined as the number of days between a patient's first occurrence of a PR (or better) and progression. If a patient goes off study prior to progression (for another reason) then they will be censored at that time.
