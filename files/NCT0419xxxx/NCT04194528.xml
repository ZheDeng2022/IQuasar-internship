  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility study to assess the use of a Digital Medicine Program (consisting of an&#xD;
      FDA-approved ingestible sensor co-encapsulated with oxycodone/acetaminophen (5 mg/325 mg), a&#xD;
      small wearable patch, and a mobile application) in cancer patients with metastatic disease&#xD;
      experiencing uncontrolled pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the high prevalence of cancer pain and issues with undertreatment and opioid misuse,&#xD;
      focused efforts to improve monitoring of medication ingestion patterns are needed. This study&#xD;
      will test the feasibility of using a Digital Medicine Program (consisting of an FDA-approved&#xD;
      ingestible sensor co-encapsulated with oxycodone/acetaminophen (5 mg/325 mg), a small&#xD;
      wearable patch, and a mobile application) in cancer patients with metastatic disease&#xD;
      experiencing uncontrolled pain. Data collected from this study (such as information on&#xD;
      patterns of DMP usage by patients and physicians and changes to medication dosage based on&#xD;
      the reported symptoms) will inform the design of a randomized controlled trial of the DMP vs.&#xD;
      usual care to control cancer pain and increase quality of life. If successful, this DMP could&#xD;
      be a new way for physicians to evaluate patients' pain medication use patterns and titrate&#xD;
      for adequate pain control while concurrently monitoring for adverse effects or&#xD;
      abusive/addictive behavior. It will also promote improved communication between patients and&#xD;
      their physicians and potentially address and ease some of patients' concerns and hesitancies&#xD;
      regarding opioid medications.&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient somatic symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline 2, 4, and 6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Patient somatic symptoms of opioid treatment will be measured using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment (revised version). Questions are rated on a scale of 1-10 with 10 being &quot;worst&quot; outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction with the Digital Medicine Program (DMP).</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction will be assessed by survey that measures patient satisfaction on a scale of 1-5 with the higher score having the better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Provider satisfaction with Digital Medicine Program (DMP)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Provider satisfaction will be assessed by survey that measures provider satisfaction on a scale of 1-5 with the higher score having the better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ePRO feasibility</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>ePRO feasibility will be defined by the extent of missing data at each assessment time for those items or instruments required to be completed using the Patient Cloud ePRO app; assessing the patient experience of using the Patient Cloud ePRO app with a one-time questionnaire at the conclusion of the study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient psychological distress</measure>
    <time_frame>2, 4, and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patient depression and anxiety will be measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4). Questions are rated on a scale of 0-3 with higher score having the worst outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient global quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>2, 4, and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patient quality of life (including anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain interference, physical function, sleep disturbance, satisfaction with participation in social roles and activities and single pain intensity) will be measured using the PROMIS-29. Patients respond to questions by marking one response: very poor, poor, fair, good and very good.</description>
