  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The burden of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is increasing worldwide. Although kidney&#xD;
      transplantation is the most cost-effective renal replacement therapy, dialysis is still the&#xD;
      main way to treat ESRD patients due to the limited kidney donor, with approximately 89% of&#xD;
      such dialysis patients receive hemodialysis (HD) and the remainder receive peritoneal&#xD;
      dialysis (PD). This distribution of dialysis modality, however, varies widely by health&#xD;
      jurisdiction. For instance, more than 97% of dialysis patients are treated with HD in Japan,&#xD;
      but more than 50% treated with PD in Mexico. Evidence comparing the two modalities suggests&#xD;
      that mortality risks may be comparable, but all evidence come from observational study and&#xD;
      there is no randomized controlled trial to compare patient survival between PD and HD due to&#xD;
      patients enrollment issue.More importantly, for most health care systems, such as United&#xD;
      States, United Kingdom, Australia, Indonesia and China, PD is less expensive than HD. It is&#xD;
      possible, then, that a greater global utilization of PD might improve access to renal&#xD;
      replacement therapy in less advanced economies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have conducted a prospective, randomized, parallel, open-label,&#xD;
      multi-center, non-inferiority trial to evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQoL) with&#xD;
      PD versus conventional in-center HD in incident ESKD patients. A total of 1082 ESKD patients&#xD;
      were randomly assigned to PD or conventional in-center HD, and 235 patients enrolled in stage&#xD;
      1 with complete measures of the &quot;Burden of Kidney Disease&quot; at both baseline and 48 weeks and&#xD;
      668 patients enrolled in stage 2 were included in analysis. However, this trial was designed&#xD;
      to evaluate quality of life between PD and HD and all patients were follow-up 48 weeks.&#xD;
      Therefore, in this observational cohort study, the investigators will perform extended&#xD;
      follow-up for participants including in analysis . Our primary objective is to evaluate the&#xD;
      association of dialysis modality (PD and HD) with all-cause mortality in ESKD patients. The&#xD;
      investigators also explore the impact of PD and HD on major cardiovascular event composite&#xD;
      (MACE), a composite outcome of MACE and all-cause death, hospitalized myocardial infarction,&#xD;
      hospitalized stroke and hospitalized heart failure, healthy utility, dialysis cost, activity&#xD;
      of daily living, and changes of RRF, hemoglobin, and other biochemical parameters.&#xD;
