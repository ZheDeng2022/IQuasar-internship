  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot feasibility study of a small randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate a&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral coping skills (CBCS) delivered via videoconferencing, referred to as the&#xD;
      &quot;VC-CBCS&quot; compared to standard of care (SC). The study will include a representative sample&#xD;
      of 32 symptomatic patients who have/had chronic hepatitis C. Patients (n=32) will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 1:3 ratio to (1) standard of care (SC) or (2) to participate in 14, two hour&#xD;
      VC-CBCS sessions. Four groups of patients will be randomized and will consist of 7-9 patients&#xD;
      each. The groups are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 - 7 patients with 5 randomized to VC-CBCS and 2 to SC;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 - 9 patients with 7 randomized to VC-CBCS and 2 to SC;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Groups 3 and 4 - 8 patients each with 6 randomized to VC-CBCS and 2 to SC each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each wave of VC-CBCS patients will form a group to join the Group Facilitator via a WebEx&#xD;
      platform on a weekly basis using iPads from their homes. The telehealth intervention provides&#xD;
      group-based education, skills and practices involving stress management, coping with&#xD;
      symptoms, and support for healthy lifestyle changes. The researchers will examine: (1) the&#xD;
      feasibility of delivering a group intervention via telehealth technology remotely using&#xD;
      iPads, (2) participant satisfaction with the intervention, and (3) whether differences are&#xD;
      observed in several outcomes between the two conditions on quality of life, physical and&#xD;
      mental symptoms, and liver markers. Patients will complete patient-reported outcome (PRO)&#xD;
      surveys at four time points during the study, with main outcomes being change from&#xD;
      pre-intervention to post-intervention.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Global Health Status Physical Health Mean T-Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (T1) to Week 14 (T4)</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Global Health Status measure is a 10-item short form that will be used to measure an individual's physical, mental, and social health. Item responses range from 5 = None to 1 = Very Severe. The adult PROMIS Global Health measure produces two scores: Physical Health and Mental Health. The raw scores are converted into a T-score. T-Score distributions are standardized such that a 50 represents the average (mean) for the US general population, and the standard deviation around that mean is 10 points. Higher T- scores indicate more of that construct, for example, a T-score=60 is 1 standard deviation better (more healthy) than the general population. The Physical Health T-score can range from 23.4 to 63.3.</description>
