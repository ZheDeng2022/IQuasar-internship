  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the average age of individuals undergoing stem cell transplant continues to increase,&#xD;
      challenges associated with balancing the side effects of cancer treatments while also&#xD;
      managing other medical conditions develop. Studies have shown these individuals develop more&#xD;
      treatment related side effects and take longer to leave the hospital due to complications.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to develop a multiple provider clinic that will help identify&#xD;
      any additional needs in the more complicated and generally older transplant patient&#xD;
      population. If needed, this clinic will recommend interventions or referrals to the&#xD;
      appropriate specialties to the participant and the transplant physician for the participant&#xD;
      before your transplant procedure. Examples of potential areas of improvement include a course&#xD;
      of physical therapy, nutritional supplements, or modifications of medications, among others&#xD;
      with the goal to make your transplant safer and to decrease length of time in the hospital.&#xD;

      This is a supportive interventional study to assess frailty in at risk geriatric cancer&#xD;
      patients undergoing stem cell transplant and to determine if specific interventions are&#xD;
      feasible and will improve overall outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 20 participants will be enrolled in this study with the first 10 participants&#xD;
      limited to myeloma or lymphoma patients who meet eligibility criteria and are candidates for&#xD;
      autologous transplantation. The second 10 participants enrolled will be either allogeneic or&#xD;
      autologous stem cell transplant candidates who meet eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To pilot a comprehensive multidisciplinary geriatric assessment clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether a comprehensive geriatric assessment (outside of physical therapy&#xD;
           assessment) can be performed in a time efficient manner. The goal is to complete all&#xD;
           questionnaires and the multidisciplinary assessments in &lt;90 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess participant and physician satisfaction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if interventions recommended in the clinic are achievable for each&#xD;
           participant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examples of interventions could include, medication changes, management of depression,&#xD;
           dietary modifications, physical therapy three times a week, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if participation in the transplant wellness clinic reduces length of stay&#xD;
           and readmission rate compared to historical controls at our institution&#xD;
