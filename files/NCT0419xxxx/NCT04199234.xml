  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the frequency of appearance of the total clinical&#xD;
      manifestations (expected adverse event: nausea, vomiting, heartburn, abdominal pain,&#xD;
      gas/swelling, diarrhea, headache, shortness of breath, metallic taste and constipation) after&#xD;
      consuming microencapsulated iron and comparator for 14 days.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will consume a daily dose once per day for 14 days with a washout period of two&#xD;
      menstrual cycles between the two products. After this washout period, subjects will return to&#xD;
      the clinical and will undergo identical procedures with counter order of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each day of the study will be recorded in a diary by each subject. Participants will be&#xD;
      requested not to change their regular life habits and diet during the entire study.&#xD;
