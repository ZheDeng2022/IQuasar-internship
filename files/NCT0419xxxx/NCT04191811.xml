  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many psychiatric patients are not sufficiently improved by current interventions. Functional&#xD;
      magnetic imaging brain imaging (fMRI) has proven to be a promising method for predicting&#xD;
      treatment outcomes in psychiatric treatment. Individuals moment-to-moment variability have&#xD;
      not yet been evaluated as a predictor of treatment of three common forms of mental illness:&#xD;
      depression, insomnia and health anxiety. The goal is to investigate whether objective&#xD;
      measurements of brain function contribute to a better prediction of a patient's success in&#xD;
      treatment than experiences and self-reports, e.g., treatment credibility and patients&#xD;
      expectations about the treatment. The prediction model will be tested on internet-delivered&#xD;
      CBT (iCBT) for depression, insomnia and health anxiety. 50 patients in each diagnostic group&#xD;
      are asked for participation before treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Being able to better predict how well a psychiatric treatment will work for an individual has&#xD;
      great value from both an economic and a treatment perspective. The findings from this study&#xD;
      may contribute to increased knowledge about neurobiological complications in mental illness.&#xD;
      In the longer term, it can lead to improved routines and help in clinical decision-making&#xD;
      when patients should be recommended treatment.&#xD;

      Background: There is extensive evidence that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an&#xD;
      effective method of treating common psychiatric disorders such as depression, health anxiety&#xD;
      and insomnia. However, access to CBT is very limited. Furthermore, evidence suggest that&#xD;
      internet-delivered CBT (iCBT) is as effective as traditional CBT. However, many psychiatric&#xD;
      patients are not sufficiently improved by current interventions. Functional brain imaging has&#xD;
      proven to be a promising method for predicting treatment outcomes in psychiatric treatment.&#xD;
      Calculations on brain signal variability based on the blood-oxygen-level-dependent, BOLD&#xD;
      signal (BOLD-fMRI) is a relatively new technique, shown to accurately predict chronological&#xD;
      age and cognitive performance. Preliminary data from the investigators' lab suggest that&#xD;
      pre-treatment BOLD-fMRI variability is predictive of CBT outcome in patients with social&#xD;
      anxiety disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The objective of the study is to investigate whether objective measurements of&#xD;
      brain function, in comparison with subjective experiences and self-reports (e.g., rating on&#xD;
      treatment credibility and patients expectations about the treatment), contribute to better&#xD;
      prediction of treatment outcome. The prediction model will be tested on iCBT for three common&#xD;
      forms of mental disorders (depression, insomnia and health anxiety). Furthermore,&#xD;
      participants will be compared with healthy controls to better understand neurobiological&#xD;
      factors that may contribute to mental illness. Preliminary data from the investigators' lab&#xD;
      suggest that BOLD-fMRI variability differs between social anxiety disorder participants and&#xD;
      healthy individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: A sample of outpatients scheduled for iCBT treatment for depression, insomnia or&#xD;
      health anxiety at the Internet Psychiatry Unit will be invited to participate in the study.&#xD;
      In addition to clinical participants, a healthy control group will be recruited via&#xD;
      advertisement in social media.The length of the iCBT intervention is 12 weeks, during which&#xD;
      participants engage in web-based treatment modules in a sequential manner, guided though a&#xD;
      digital messaging system by a licensed psychologist who provides support and feedback on&#xD;
      progress and assignments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measuring instruments: Brain imaging is performed before the patients initiate psychiatric&#xD;
      treatment. The brain will be examined with structural and functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) using an EPI sequence to capture the BOLD signal (Philips 3-Tesla, 32 channel&#xD;
      head-coil).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the online self-referral process and during clinical intake interview, data on a&#xD;
      number of potential predictor variables are collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Within the social-demographic domain: age; gender; relationship status (dichotomized as&#xD;
           being single or not); level of education rated on a 7-point scale (1 = less than 7-9&#xD;
           years in school; 2 = 7-9 years in school; 3 = incomplete vocational or secondary school;&#xD;
           4 = vocational school; 5 = secondary school; 6 = university, started but not completed&#xD;
           studies; 7 = completed university studies); employment status dichotomized as working&#xD;
           full-time or not; and having children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Within the clinical characteristics domain: duration of illness (years since onset),&#xD;
           history of psychotropic medication, history of inpatient psychiatric care, history of&#xD;
           depression, attempted suicide, currently on medication, and currently on psychotropic&#xD;
           medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence (yes/no) of any comorbid illness is assessed using the the Mini-International&#xD;
           Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), including panic disorder, agoraphobia, social anxiety&#xD;
           disorder, insomnia, health anxiety, mild depressive episode, moderate depressive&#xD;
           episode, severe depressive episode, recurrent mild depressive episode, recurrent&#xD;
           moderate depressive episode, recurrent severe depressive episode, recurrent depression&#xD;
           without current symptoms and dysthymia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Having a family history of mental illness is assessed prior to treatment, screening for&#xD;
           having a family history of dependence / substance abuse, bipolar disorder, depression,&#xD;
           minor depression, neuropsychiatric condition, anxiety, panic disorder, psychosis, social&#xD;
           anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder-like symptoms, suicide attempts or suicide&#xD;
           completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment process factors including perceived treatment credibility measured during the&#xD;
           second week in treatment, measured with the Treatment Credibility Scale (TCS) where&#xD;
           patients' attitudes to the credibility of the treatment and expectancy regarding&#xD;
           treatment effectiveness are rated on a 10-point scale (0 = not at all to 10 = very&#xD;
           much). Second, treatment adherence is measured at post-treatment, reflecting the degree&#xD;
           of use of the ICBT program operationalised as the total number of activated treatment&#xD;
           modules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements only administered at screening/pre-treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Panic Disorder Severity Scale - Self rated (PDSS-SR; all participants)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, Self-report (LSAS-SR; all participants)&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  General Self-Efficacy scale (S-GSE; insomnia participants)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioural measurements before/while undergoing MRI (all participants):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Affect (valence and arousal). &quot;How much pleasure or discomfort are you feeling right&#xD;
           now? (1-9)&quot; and &quot;How calm or upset do you feel right now? (1-9)&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjective unit of discomfort (SUD): fear and distress (0-100)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-rated health (SRH-5)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Short Grit Scale (Grit-S)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predictors of treatment outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Behavioral predictor(s) of treatment outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Questions about desired and expected treatment improvement. These include a)&#xD;
                treatment credibility and b) modified PHQ-9, SHAI and ISI questionnaires where the&#xD;
                participants' expectation after completed treatment is self-rated for each item as&#xD;
                well as participants' desire of improvement on a 0-100 scale for each item.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Ecological momentary assessments (EMA) with repeated sampling of participants'&#xD;
                current behaviors and experiences in real time (4 times/day, during approximately 5&#xD;
                days prior to MRI procedure), including sleep problems, sleepiness, depressive&#xD;
                symptoms, fear and discomfort. The purpose is to measure different and varied&#xD;
                experiences / feelings over time. Variability in experiences will be compared to&#xD;
                the participant's variability in brain function to answer the question of whether&#xD;
                emotion variability can predict treatment outcomes. The specific EMA questions&#xD;
                include the following: PHQ-2, Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), Item 1 from ISI,&#xD;
                Item 1 from SHAI, and subjective units of discomfort (fear and distress).&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Faces&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Scenes&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mooney faces&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Retinotopy, i.e., traveling-wave method&#xD;

             abdomen, chest, heart or brain, eyes, ears? For example, vessel clips, or objects such&#xD;
             as screws, heart valve, shunt or prosthesis?&quot; 3) &quot;Do you have or have you had any&#xD;
             metallic object in your body?&quot; 4) &quot;If a woman, are you pregnant or breastfeeding?&quot; 5)&#xD;
             &quot;Do you undergo dialysis or have kidney dysfunction?&quot; Participants who answer yes to&#xD;
             these follow-up questions will be interviewed more closely to determine if MRI&#xD;
             security can be guaranteed and whether the MRI signal will have significant&#xD;
             disruptions, for example due to dental scaffolding. 1) &quot;If you have any abdominal,&#xD;
             thoracic, heart or brain, eyes, ears? Do you have any inoperable object that has&#xD;
             ferromagnetic properties?&quot; The patient will be asked to consult his doctor about this.&#xD;
             2) &quot;If you have a dental rack, what type of dental rack (fixed or removable, metal&#xD;
             plates / rails or wire)&quot;?&#xD;
