  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the incidence of maternal obesity and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is on the&#xD;
      rise globally, how to improve the intrauterine environment of the offspring and prevent&#xD;
      obesity and metabolic diseases from the early life has become a medical research. Since 2012,&#xD;
      journals such as Nature and Science have reported that intestinal micro-ecological&#xD;
      environments composed of intestinal microbes and their interactions are involved in human&#xD;
      body and energy metabolism, and a variety of metabolic diseases including obesity and type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The incidence is closely related. Although intestinal microbes have&#xD;
      an important impact on human health, the research on intestinal microecology during pregnancy&#xD;
      is still in its infancy. The current research is still unclear about the relationship between&#xD;
      intestinal microecology and pregnancy outcomes and whether it can be a potential target for&#xD;
      regulating maternal metabolism and fetal intrauterine environment. Therefore, this study aims&#xD;
      to regulate overweight/obese pregnant women by using prebiotic-containing dairy products to&#xD;
      explore the effects of interventions targeting intestinal microbes on glucose and lipid&#xD;
      metabolism, insulin resistance and risk of GDM in overweight/obese pregnant women. In order&#xD;
      to improve the intrauterine environment and reduce the risk of fetal diseases. It is of great&#xD;
      significance and value to improve the quality of the birth population in China and to&#xD;
      alleviate the medical economic burden caused by obesity and metabolic diseases.&#xD;
