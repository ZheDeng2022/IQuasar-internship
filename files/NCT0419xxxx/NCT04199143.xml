  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent evidence suggest that Nitrous Oxyde (N2O) could exhibit antidepressant effect in&#xD;
      treatment-resistant depression (TRD). However, the pathophysiology of this effect remains&#xD;
      unclear and could include glutamatergic activity but also cerebrovascular effects and changes&#xD;
      in brain connectivity. The goal of our study is to characterize brain reactivity to N2O in&#xD;
      TRD patients, as assessed with Ultrasound Tissue Pulsatility Imaging (TPI) and Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Imaging (MRI) (including Arterial Spin Labeling - ASL - for brain perfusion and&#xD;
      Blood-Oxygen-Level Dependent - BOLD - for brain connectivity and pulsatility).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound and MRI Neuroimaging will be measured before, during and after a single one-hour&#xD;
      exposure of a 50%N20/50%O2 mixture, in depressed individuals (n=20) and healthy volunteers&#xD;
      (n=10). We make the hypothesis that brain reactivity will be lower in depressed individuals&#xD;
      nonresponders to N2O compared to responders and healthy controls. This study would provide&#xD;
      further characterisation of the pathophysiology of the antidepressant response to N2O, as&#xD;
      well as providing potential biomakers (Ultrasound and MRI) for treatment response to N2O in&#xD;
      TRD.&#xD;

      Neuroimaging examinations will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasound Tissue Pulsatility Imaging for assessment of Brain Tissue Pulsatility (BTP)&#xD;
           which reflects reactivity in brain movements and mechanical brain properties&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI with structural and functional assessments, namely brain volumes, white matter&#xD;
           lesions, ASL for brain perfusion and BOLD for resting-state connectivity and brain&#xD;
           pulsatility&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI will be performed before and after a single one-hour exposure of 50%N2O/50%O2 mixture.&#xD;
      Ultrasound will be performed before, after and also during gas exposure. Changes in these&#xD;
      neuroimaging parameters will constitute the primary assessment of the study. Psychometric and&#xD;
      safety assessements will complete the neuroimaging outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up will includes 1) a baseline visit for baseline MRI and Psychometric assessements,&#xD;
      2) a second visit for gas exposure and neuroimaging assessements, 3) a third and fourth&#xD;
      visits for psychometric and safety assessements, respectively 24 hours and one week after gas&#xD;
      exposure.&#xD;
