  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the effect of omalizumab on exercise capacity, physical activity, and&#xD;
      sleep quality after 24 weeks of treatment in participants with moderate to severe allergic&#xD;
      asthma. Exercise capacity will be assessed using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET).&#xD;
      Physical activity and sleep quality will be assessed with a wearable physical activity and&#xD;
      sleep monitor. The study will consist of a 4-week screening period, a 24-week treatment&#xD;
      period, and a 4-week safety follow-up. Approximately 60 participants will be enrolled, and&#xD;
      omalizumab will be dosed according to the approved United States Package Insert (USPI) dosing&#xD;
      table.&#xD;
