    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to test whether GD2-CAR T cells can be successfully made&#xD;
      from immune cells collected from children and young adults with H3K27M-mutant diffuse&#xD;
      intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) or spinal H3K27M-mutant diffuse midline glioma (DMG).&#xD;
      H3K27Mmutant testing will occur as part of standard of care prior to enrollment.&#xD;

      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the feasibility of manufacturing autologous T cells transduced with&#xD;
           14g2a-CD8-BBz-iCasp9 retroviral vector expressing GD2 Chimeric Antigen Receptor&#xD;
           (GD2CART) for administration in subjects with H3K27M+ diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma&#xD;
           (DIPG) or subjects with spinal H3 K27M-mutant diffuse midline glioma (DMG) using a&#xD;
           retroviral vector and dasatinib in the Miltenyi CliniMACS Prodigy® system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the safety and identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase&#xD;
           2 dose (RP2D) of GD2CART in subjects with H3K27M+ DIPG administered after&#xD;
           cyclophosphamide/fludarabine-based lymphodepletion regimen using the following dose&#xD;
           escalation schedule: DL1: 1e6 transduced T cells/kg; DL2: 3e6 transduced T cells/kg;&#xD;
           DL3: 10e6 transduced T cells/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the safety of the MTD/RP2D of GD2CART in subjects with spinal H3K27M mutant DMG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In a preliminary manner, assess clinical benefit of GD2CART at the RP2D in subjects with&#xD;
           H3K27M DIPG or spinal H3 K27M-mutant DMG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If unacceptable toxicity occurs that is possibly, probably or likely related to GD2CART,&#xD;
           assess the capacity for AP1903, a dimerizing agent, to mediate clearance of the&#xD;
           genetically engineered cells and resolve toxicity.&#xD;

    <description>Dose escalation in subjects with DIPG:&#xD;
A standard 3+3 dose escalation design will test GD2-CAR T cells in subjects with H3K27M-mutant DIPG, starting with Dose&#xD;
Level 1:&#xD;
Dose Level 1: 1x10^6 CAR+ T cells/kg body weight (+/- 20%)&#xD;

Dose Level 3: 10x10^6 CAR+ T cells/kg body weight (+/- 20%)&#xD;
Dose Level -1 will be explored if the first subject treated experiences dose limiting toxicity (DLT) or if &gt;2 of 6 subjects treated at Dose Level 1 experiences DLT.&#xD;
Dose expansion in subjects with DIPG and spinal DMG: Once the MTD or RP2D is determined, up to 20 evaluable subjects with H3K27M-mutant DIPG and 10 evaluable subjects with H3K27M-mutant spinal DMG will be treated at the RP2D (including subjects treated during dose escalation).</description>
