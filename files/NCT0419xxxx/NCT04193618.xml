      Placental borders and mapping were detected carefully by ultrasonography and Doppler&#xD;
      ultrasonography (placental mapping) preop. And verified intraoperatively ..&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the mapping, in a subset of patients we entered the abdomen by transverse&#xD;
      suprapubic incision; in another subset we entered the abdomen by infraumbilical midline&#xD;
      incision which was extended to a supra umbilical one in cases with anterior placentae with&#xD;
      high upper margin .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Followed by bladder peritoneal dissection till either the level of internal Os is reached or&#xD;
      a level with extensive adherence and/ or invasion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uterus is incised away from the placenta, according to the plan we described by placental&#xD;
      mapping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of uterine incisions is determined after placental mapping. Placental borders have been&#xD;
      identified, and incisions were made far away from placenta. J-shaped, vertical and upper&#xD;
      transverse incisions were used .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cases of high anterior wall placentae a fundal anterior incision is made separate from the&#xD;
      placental invaded uterine segment that will be excised later and both incisions will be&#xD;
      repaired separately ..&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baby was delivered , the uterus is exteriorised and 4-5 towel clips are applied rapidly&#xD;
           control uterine incision site bleeding .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty units of diluted oxytocin and 100 to 200 cc, 37°C of heated saline were infused from&#xD;
      here, and then the cord was clamped .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then we proceed to systemically devascularize the uterus with the placenta in site&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  internal iliac artery distal ligation: posterior pelvic peritoneum is incised and&#xD;
           bilateral internal iliac arteries are ligated distally just before the offset of the&#xD;
           uterine artery, to avoid collateral re-feeding of the internal iliac artery in case of&#xD;
           proximal ligation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  broad ligament and ureteric dissection: the base of each broad ligament , both its&#xD;
           leaflets and contents are dissected upwards , towards the utero-ovarian vessels away&#xD;
           from the uterine lower segment , both ureters are dissected until each ureteric tunnel&#xD;
           is identified&#xD;
&#xD;
           , emptying the base of the broad ligament bilaterally helps apply temporary manual&#xD;
           circumferencial pressure on cervix in cases of failed conservation and excess bleeding ,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  uterine vessels : simple or figure of 8 sutures are applied to each uterine artery and&#xD;
           vein on each side incorporating 1 cm wide of the lateral part of the lower segment ,&#xD;
           this is done just below the placenta or 1 cm above the ureteric tunnel in cases of deep&#xD;
           placental invasion .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cases with extensive broad ligament invasion another high uterine vessels ligation is done&#xD;
      to reduce bleeding from the spared utero-ovarian collaterals&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  posterior uterine wall compression suture : transverse mattress suture is applied at the&#xD;
           level of the lower most bulge of the placenta, as low as the levels of the ureteric&#xD;
           tunnels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The utero-ovarian anastomosis branches are spared to keep blood flowing to the uterus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  if the bladder was not fully dissected from the anterior uterine wall , now we complete&#xD;
           the dissection, noticing the bleeding is less in amount compared to cases we undertake&#xD;
           bladder full dissection first before devascularization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  anterior uterine wall compression suture : A transverse mattress suture is placed below&#xD;
           the placental bulge , incorporating most of the anterior uterine wall tissues , 1 cm&#xD;
           medial to each uterine vessel ligatures&#xD;
&#xD;
           , at a corresponding level to the posterior uterine compression suture, while avoiding&#xD;
           incorporating the posterior uterine wall to avoid closing the cervical canal&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  now , we excise the invaded , irreparable anterior wall segment, with the First inch of&#xD;
           the incision we notice the uterine incision bleeding , in case the bleeding is low flow&#xD;
           &amp; brown in colour in case of proper devascularization, if the bleeding is high flow&#xD;
           bright red we revise our ligatures then continue the excision&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  then separation of the placenta manually&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  if there's still mild bleeding from the uterine placental bed another full myometrial&#xD;
           thickness anterior or posterior uterine wall transverse sutures are applied below or&#xD;
           above the placental bed site to control bleeding until it's deemed acceptable&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  in cases with separate fundal anterior incision, the high incision is repaired in layers&#xD;
           first to give more time to compress and monitor the lower segment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  refashioning of the Lower segment , repair transversely is usually done, in cases with a&#xD;
           wide placental invasion disc excision of a diameter 15-20 cm, if the defect is long we&#xD;
           close the incision longitudinally, while maintaining the cervical canal patent at all&#xD;
           times&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  we observe for vaginal bleeding for 20 - 30 minutes intraoperatively before abdominal&#xD;
           wall closure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  closure over 2 wide bore drains&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  we continue administration of oxytocin postoperatively&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  we continue monitoring for vaginal bleeding for the next 24 hours&#xD;
