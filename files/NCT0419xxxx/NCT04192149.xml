  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Focused ultrasound at low intensities is a form of neuromodulation with high spatial&#xD;
      resolution that can be applied invasively or non-invasively using acoustic energy to affect&#xD;
      neuronal activity. The purpose of this study is to better understand the effects of low&#xD;
      intensity focused ultrasound (FUS) on the central nervous system. Specific patient&#xD;
      populations within UVA health system are undergoing treatment that provide unique&#xD;
      opportunities to study these effects.&#xD;

      Focused ultrasound (FUS) at low intensities is a form of neuromodulation with high spatial&#xD;
      resolution that can be applied invasively or non-invasively using acoustic energy to affect&#xD;
      neuronal activity. In this study the investigators intended to use specific patient&#xD;
      populations to investigate the effects of FUS on different areas of the central nervous&#xD;
      system (CNS). Each of our patients groups is undergoing a unique procedure at University of&#xD;
      Virginia that will provide us different insights into the CNS. (1) Patients receiving an&#xD;
      awake or asleep craniotomy for brain tumors and/or epilepsy will undergo a brain mapping&#xD;
      procedure using electrical stimulation as a part of their normal care. The research&#xD;
      procedures will duplicate this mapping with an invasive FUS mapping. (2) Patients undergoing&#xD;
      long term monitoring for epilepsy will receive a non-invasive form of FUS stimulation which&#xD;
      will be measured by their EEG cap and intracranial electrodes which are a part of their&#xD;
      normal care. (3) Patients undergoing high intensity FUS treatment for tremor will be asked to&#xD;
      wear a research provided EEG cap while undergoing a non-invasive low intensity FUS research&#xD;
      procedure and changes in their tremor will be monitored. (4) Patients undergoing Deep Brain&#xD;
      Stimulation (DBS) treatment for tremor will receive a non-invasive FUS stimulation observed&#xD;
      through their newly implanted electrode. (5) Patients receiving a spinal surgery will undergo&#xD;
      a spinal stimulation using electrical stimulation as a part of their normal care. The&#xD;
      research procedures will duplicate this with an invasive FUS stimulation.&#xD;
