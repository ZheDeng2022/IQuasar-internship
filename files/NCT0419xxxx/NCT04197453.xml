  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      cvMOBIUS is a North American registry of patients with ASCVD aimed at understanding patterns&#xD;
      of care in ASCVD while evaluating the real world effectiveness of PCSK9 inhibitors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this registry is to evaluate the effectiveness of proprotein convertase&#xD;
      subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors (PCSK9i) to reduce cardiovascular events among&#xD;
      subjects presenting with a recent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) event in&#xD;
      real-world practice. A total of 8500 patients with a recent cardiovascular event who are&#xD;
      likely to be eligible for non-statin lipid lowering therapy will be enrolled and followed&#xD;
      prospectively for five years. In addition, the study will assess longitudinal patterns of&#xD;
      lipid control, clinical outcomes, and LLT including statins, ezetimibe, and PCSK9 inhibitors&#xD;
      in adults with an ASCVD event and/or revascularization. This study will also compare the&#xD;
      clinical characteristics and outcomes of subjects enrolled in both arms of the registry to&#xD;
      understand the strengths and limitations of data harvested directly from electronic health&#xD;
      record (EHR) systems as compared with prospectively collected information.&#xD;
