  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recognizes the importance of developing&#xD;
      patient-centric endpoints that are relevant to patients beyond mortality and&#xD;
      hospitalizations. Patients with HF have reduced function capacity and quality of life (QoL)&#xD;
      and hence it is imperative to explore interventions that impact endpoints that directly&#xD;
      measure how a patient feels or functions on a daily basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, new mobile health technologies have emerged as clinical tools and offer an&#xD;
      opportunity to overcome these challenges in measuring functional capacity and recording&#xD;
      symptoms. These technologies are able to capture and integrate data from disparate sources&#xD;
      from individual patients reflecting their functional status and symptomatology. These data&#xD;
      can potentially serve as surrogate endpoints for approval of new HF therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will test the feasibility of a novel mobile health&#xD;
      monitoring platform to capture patients' physiology, functional capacity and assessment of&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart Failure (HF) is a highly prevalent disease that also carries high morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. Improvements in mortality and healthcare utilization, including hospitalizations&#xD;
      of HF still remain the gold standard outcomes for HF drug approval. However, it is difficult&#xD;
      to improve mortality as the only endpoint due to the variation in the age groups and&#xD;
      comorbidities of the population and ineffectiveness to alter all-cause mortality,&#xD;
      particularly in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).&#xD;
      Considering these issues, there is a need for exploration of complimentary endpoints. The&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recognizes the importance of developing patient-centric&#xD;
      endpoints that are relevant to patients beyond mortality and hospitalizations. Patients with&#xD;
      HF have reduced function capacity and quality of life (QoL) and hence it is imperative to&#xD;
      explore interventions that impact endpoints that directly measure how a patient feels or&#xD;
      functions on a daily basis. Although functional status can be objectively measured by peak&#xD;
      exercise oxygen consumption, it is difficult and impractical to implement in large clinical&#xD;
      studies, especially in an ambulatory real-world setting. Other objective measures of&#xD;
      functional status include a 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and potentially measures of activity&#xD;
      using implanted or wearable sensors. Patient-reported outcomes (PROMs) can also be used to&#xD;
      record and quantify symptoms but are cumbersome and impractical since significant resources&#xD;
      are required to contact patients and administer questionnaires. It is also particularly&#xD;
      difficult to record these and correlate with physiologic signals in real-time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, new mobile health technologies have emerged as clinical tools and offer an&#xD;
      opportunity to overcome these challenges in measuring functional capacity and recording&#xD;
      symptoms. These technologies are able to capture and integrate data from disparate sources&#xD;
      from individual patients reflecting their functional status and symptomatology. These data&#xD;
      can potentially serve as surrogate endpoints for approval of new HF therapies. A novel mobile&#xD;
      health platform (BiovitalsHF, developed by Biofourmis) enables continuous acquisition and&#xD;
      monitoring of multiple physiologic data (for e.g. electrocardiogram, heart rate, respiration&#xD;
      rate, activity intensity, 3-axis accelerometer and sleep) using readily available biosensors&#xD;
      (Everion® MD and Apple Watch will be used for this study). The BiovitalsHF smartphone app is&#xD;
      capable of capturing patient's physiology, functional capacity (using activity patterns,&#xD;
      including guided mobile-based 6MWT) and assessment of QoL through validated PROs.&#xD;
