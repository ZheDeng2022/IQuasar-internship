    <description>CVisc50 OVD will be carefully injected into the anterior chamber using standard aseptic technique, during the surgical procedure. The duration of the treatment is anticipated to be approximately 15-20 minutes for the surgical procedure. The OVD may also be used to coat surgical instruments prior to IOL implantation (for example, the internal surfaces of an IOL inserter are typically filled and/or coated with the OVD to provide lubricity during IOL compression and delivery into the eye). Additional OVD of the same product, may be injected as needed throughout surgery to keep the anterior chamber fully formed and to re-inflate the capsular bag following cataract removal. At the end of the surgical procedure it is recommended that OVD be removed from the eye as completely as practical by thoroughly irrigating and aspirating with a sterile irrigating solution.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant must be at least 45 years old and have a clinically documented&#xD;
             diagnosis of age-related non-complicated cataract that is considered amenable to&#xD;
             treatment with standard phacoemulsification cataract extraction and IOL implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant must have the capability to provide written informed consent on the&#xD;
             Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC) approved Informed Consent Form&#xD;
             (ICF) and provide authorization as appropriate for local privacy regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant must be willing and able to undergo all pre-surgical and surgical&#xD;
             procedures and to return for all scheduled follow-up examinations through 90 days&#xD;
             following surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant must have clear intraocular media other than the cataract in the&#xD;
             operative eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has participated in any drug or device clinical investigation within&#xD;
             30 days prior to entry into this study and/or plans to do so during the period of&#xD;
             study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has any corneal pathology (for example; significant scarring, guttata,&#xD;
             inflammation, edema, dystrophy, etc.) in the operative eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has anterior segment pathology likely to increase the risk of an&#xD;
             adverse outcome for phacoemulsification cataract surgery (for example;&#xD;
             pseudoexfoliation syndrome, synechiae, iris atrophy, inadequate dilation, shallow&#xD;
             anterior chamber, traumatic cataract, lens subluxation) in the operative eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has any condition which prevents reliable specular microscopy in the&#xD;
             operative eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has a congenital ocular anomaly (for example; aniridia, congenital&#xD;
             cataract) in the operative eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has a baseline ECD &lt;1500 cells/square millimeter (mm^2) in the&#xD;
             operative eye.&#xD;

             during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant is scheduled to undergo other combined intraocular procedures during&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The participant has diabetic retinopathy, wet age-related macular degeneration or&#xD;
             other retinal pathology which might limit postoperative visual acuity (VA) or&#xD;

             eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has a best corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA) of logarithm of&#xD;
             minimum angle resolution (LogMAR) 1.0 (20/200, 6/60) or worse in the fellow eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has had previous corneal surgery in the planned operative eye.&#xD;
