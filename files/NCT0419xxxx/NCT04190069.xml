  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to examine the extent to which diet/lifestyle change programs&#xD;
      with a multidisciplinary team (consisting of a dietician, physician and behaviorist/health&#xD;
      coach) that develop healthy behaviors before creating a calorie deficit for weight loss will&#xD;
      result in greater weight loss and a longer duration of weight maintenance. It intends to&#xD;
      compare the extent of weight loss and weight maintenance in participants who will undergo&#xD;
      calorie restriction without prior behavioral interventions to participants that will undergo&#xD;
      behavioral interventions prior to starting calorie restriction.&#xD;

      OPTIFAST is a medically supervised weight loss and weight management program that involves a&#xD;
      complete meal replacement followed by a gradual introduction of foods after dietary&#xD;
      education. The resources offered through this program are through a physician, registered&#xD;
      dietitian and behaviorist, including a psychologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UPMC Prescription for Wellness is an innovative physician/provider prescribed coaching and&#xD;
      feedback program that improves patient engagement and outcomes in healthy behaviors;&#xD;
      self-care of chronic disease and condition management; and shared decision-making. The&#xD;
      resources available through this program are offered via a telephonic health coach, online or&#xD;
      through a digital intervention based on the participant's convenience.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Behavioral interventions will first be provided by UPMC Prescription for Wellness prior to&#xD;
      starting OPTIFAST. Calorie restriction will be during the OPTIFAST Program. The participants&#xD;
      will be actively recruited by the study team at the Center for Diabetes and Metabolism (CDE)&#xD;
      at the Falk Clinic in Oakland, Pittsburgh.&#xD;
