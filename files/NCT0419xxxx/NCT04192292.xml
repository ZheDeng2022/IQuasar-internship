      The Study of Sulphonylurea Synergy with DPP4 Inhibitors (SSS Study) will establish whether a&#xD;
      very low dose of sulphonylurea will have a synergistic role on augmentation of insulin&#xD;
      secretion when given in combination with a DPP4 inhibitor as a primary outcome. The study&#xD;
      will recruit 30 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus controlled with no treatment or&#xD;
      metformin monotherapy with an HbA1c &lt;64mmol/mol (&lt;8%). In this unblinded, randomised&#xD;
      physiological study, participants will receive four 14-day intervention blocks: low dose&#xD;
      sulphonylurea alone, DPP4 inhibitor alone, low dose sulphonylurea + DPP4 inhibitor or no&#xD;
      treatment change. The primary outcome will be assessed through evaulation of insulin&#xD;
      secretion and sensitivity at mixed meal test at the end of each treatment block. Glycaemic&#xD;
      variability on continuous glucose monitoring for each intervention block will be evaluated as&#xD;
      a secondary outcome. In addition, the primary outcome will be evaulated for KCNJ11 genotype&#xD;
      as an additional secondary outcome.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Study of Sulphonylurea Synergy with DPP4 Inhibitors (SSS Study) aims to establish whether&#xD;
      a very low dose of SU will have a synergistic role to increase insulin secretion when given&#xD;
      in combination with DPP4 inhibitors (DPP4i). This physiological study will assess glucose&#xD;
      variability and insulin secretion through mixed meal tests and continuous glucose monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SSS Study is a follow-on study from The Study of Sulphonylurea Synergy with Incretins&#xD;
      (LOGIC Study 2018DM01, 18/ES/0064, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03705195) which established that the&#xD;
      use of low dose sulphonylurea as a physiological stimulus augments insulin secretion through&#xD;
      synergistic action with incretin hormones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, low dose sulphonylurea will again be used as a physiological stimulus. A DPP4i&#xD;
      will be given to increase levels of incretin hormones. The investigator's hypothesis is that&#xD;
      a combination of low-dose sulphonylurea with a DPP4i will further augment insulin secretion&#xD;
      than with low-dose SU alone. In addition, utilising results from LOGIC Study, the low-dose SU&#xD;
      has been shown to promote insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent mechanism via synergy with&#xD;
      incretin hormones, therefore glycaemic variability should be minimised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SSS study will take place at The Clinical Research Centre in Dundee over 6 visits. It&#xD;
      will evaluate 30 patients with T2DM on no diabetes therapy or metformin monotherapy. All&#xD;
      participants will continue their existing diabetes treatment for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SSS Study clinical stage will be 8 weeks. A screening visit will obtain Informed Written&#xD;
      Consent for Study, along with baseline medical information and screening bloods to ensure the&#xD;
      participant is safe to take part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are four, 2-week blocks during the clinical phase of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Block 1: No change to treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Block 2: Low Dose Sulphonylurea Once Daily&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Block 3: DPP4i Once Daily&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Block 4: Low Dose Sulphonylurea + DPP4i Once Daily&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SSS Study is randomised to intervention order. Participants will crossover to receive&#xD;
      each intervention during the study period. They will be randomised using a computer&#xD;
      randomisation software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the four intensive visits, participants will undergo a two-hour MMT to assess&#xD;
      post-prandial glucose variance. In addition, participants will wear CGM (Freestyle Libre Pro&#xD;
      Flash Continuous Glucose Monitoring System, Abbot) for the duration of study to assess&#xD;
      overall physiological glucose variability. The CGM sensor will be replaced at each study&#xD;
      visit. The CGM has a dedicated software, meters will be downloaded to a secure University&#xD;
      computer. The software produces an analysis of blood sugar readings for the last 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of glycaemic variability and post-prandial insulin secretion after each of the&#xD;
      treatment periods will investigate whether low-dose SU and DPP4i further augment insulin&#xD;
      secretion compared with low-dose SU alone.&#xD;
