  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to find out if liraglutide (brand name is SaxendaÂ®) can safely&#xD;
      and effectively reduce craving for opioids in patients with opioid use disorder, a primary&#xD;
      factor contributing to early relapse.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for the proposed research is to develop an acute intervention that can improve&#xD;
      treatment outcomes in opioid use disorder (OUD) by reducing craving, a primary factor&#xD;
      contributing to early relapse. Although liraglutide was approved for human use in 2010, there&#xD;
      are no data testing the effectiveness in patients with an OUD. The objective of the proposed&#xD;
      research is to test whether treatment with a GLP-1R agonist can reduce craving in humans with&#xD;
      OUD. Understanding how a 'satiety' agent may affect craving and brain responses to drug cues&#xD;
      in an OUD population would provide entirely novel information. If liraglutide shows a trend&#xD;
      towards efficacy, and safety of the GLP-1R agonist is demonstrated in this population, it&#xD;
      would provide an indication to run the second phase, multi-center clinical trial of GLP-1R&#xD;
      agonist in OUD patients.&#xD;
