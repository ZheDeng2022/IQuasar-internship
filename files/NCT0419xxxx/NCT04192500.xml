    <textblock>
      This Phase 2a clinical study is designed to evaluate the immunogenicity and the safety of one&#xD;
      dose of OVX836 influenza vaccine administered IM, confirm the dose level and regimen, and&#xD;
      expand immunogenicity and safety data to adults through age 65.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2a, randomised, double-blind study in 300 adults to compare the safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of OVX836 to QIV (Influvac TetraTM). One dose of OVX836 at two dose levels&#xD;
      will be administered intramuscularly, in comparison to Influvac TetraTM, quadrivalent&#xD;
      seasonal influenza sub-unit vaccine in healthy subjects aged 18-65 years.&#xD;

             consistently and correctly are considered as highly effective birth control methods.&#xD;
             Such methods include: combined (estrogen- and progestogen-containing) hormonal&#xD;
             contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal,&#xD;
             transdermal), progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of&#xD;
             ovulation (oral, injectable, implantable intrauterine device, intrauterine&#xD;

             drug abuse, or current smoking habit above 10 cigarettes per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Treatment that can affect immune response such as systemic or high dose inhaled&#xD;
             corticosteroids (&gt;800 μg/day beclomethasone or equivalent; occasional inhaled&#xD;
             corticosteroids for asthma therapy are allowed), radiation treatment, cytotoxic drugs,&#xD;
             or current or recent (within 30 days before study entry) chronic or prolonged (&gt;10&#xD;
             days) use of systemic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, interferon,&#xD;
             immunomodulators, allergy shots, as judged by the Investigator.&#xD;

             comparator vaccine, as traces such as eggs (ovalbumin, chicken proteins),&#xD;
             formaldehyde, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, polysorbate 80, or gentamicin.&#xD;

&#xD;
         20. Individuals with history of any illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator,&#xD;

             due to participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Technical difficulties in the use of an e-diary.&#xD;
