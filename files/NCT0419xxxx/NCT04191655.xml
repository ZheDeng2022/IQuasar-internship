  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) involving the colon is a known risk for colon cancer. There&#xD;
      are two standards-of-care colonoscopy techniques used for screening all patients who suffer&#xD;
      from IBD for more than eight years. One method is to obtain random biopsies throughout the&#xD;
      colon and the other is by using dye spraying chromo-colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial aims to study the difference between the two colonoscopy techniques during the era&#xD;
      of high definition camera in detecting neoplastic lesions during screening patients with&#xD;
      long-standing IBD.&#xD;

      Research Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is High Definition White Light Colonoscopy (HDWLC) not inferior to Dye Spraying&#xD;
      Chromo-colonoscopy (DSC) in detecting all neoplastic lesions during screening patients with&#xD;
      colonic IBD for more than eight years?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting: The study will be conducted at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Patients&#xD;
      will be randomized to HDWLC with biopsies every 10 cm versus DSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Adult patients colonic IBD for more than eight years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment The study team will conduct a day by day chart review for all patients with a&#xD;
      history of inflammatory bowel disease who were scheduled for screening colonoscopy and find&#xD;
      candidates who meet the eligibility criteria. A study team member will meet with the&#xD;
      potential candidates during their visit to the gastroenterology procedure room before having&#xD;
      their colonoscopy and offer them to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: Participants will undergo either HDWLC with biopsies every 10 cm or DSC based on&#xD;
      the randomization. Both procedures are standard of care and are being done at BIDMC before&#xD;
      starting this study. All the endoscopists are IBD specialists with expertise in both&#xD;
      procedures. All physicians were given a review article and video of chromoendoscopy to&#xD;
      further standardize practice. The clinicians who are conducting the HDWLC are allowed to do a&#xD;
      targeted DSC if required as per hospital protocol. Both arms of the study are using high&#xD;
      definition Olympus colonoscopes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A randomized controlled, noninferiority trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Existing literatures suggest that the detection rate of the DSC arm is 20%. The investigators&#xD;
      set 10% as the non-inferiority margin. With a total of 400 subjects (200 in each arm), the&#xD;
      study will have 80% power to detect non-inferiority with the type I error rate controlled at&#xD;
      0.05. To account for a potential 25% data attribution, the study team will enroll 500&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline characteristics of the two trial arms will first be tabulated for potential&#xD;
      imbalance in variables. Continuous variables will be summarized by typical parameters such as&#xD;
      mean, standard deviation and range and compared using two-sample T-test (if the normality&#xD;
      assumption holds) or Wilcoxon rank-sum test (if the normality assumption does not hold).&#xD;
      Normality of distribution will be determined using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit&#xD;
      test. Categorical data will be summarized by frequency and percentage and analyzed using the&#xD;
      Chi-square or Fishers exact test, as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be compared using Z-test based on normal approximation of the sample&#xD;
      proportions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome analysis: Intention to treat Secondary outcome analysis: Per protocol&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;

    <masking_description>In this study, we will randomize a total of 500 participants into two arms: A. high definition white light colonoscopy with biopsy (n=250) or B. chromocolonoscopy (n=250).&#xD;
The randomization schedule was created by using GraphPad website. Then sealed opaque envelopes which numbered from 1 to 500 for all subjects were created based on the randomization schedules by one of the study co-investigators (Mohammed El-Dallal MD). These envelopes will be opened only by the endoscopy provider once the subject agrees and sings the informed consent. Of note, the randomization schedules will be saved in a separate document that only Mohammed El-Dallal MD has access to it. Neither the participants nor the study members (other than Mohammed El-Dallal MD) know about the assignment before opening the envelopes.</masking_description>
