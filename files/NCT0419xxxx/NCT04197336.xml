  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is defined as a body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m2 and with a subclass of obesity known&#xD;
      as morbid or severe obesity (BMI of ≥40 kg/m2). These are major issues in medicine for both&#xD;
      participants and medical providers with &gt;36% of the US population affected. Obesity is one of&#xD;
      the biggest causes of preventable chronic diseases and healthcare costs in the USA. Obese&#xD;
      adults spend 42% more on direct healthcare costs and morbidly obese adults overall have 81%&#xD;
      higher healthcare costs than non-obese adults. Obesity is currently treated with dietary,&#xD;
      pharmacological, and/or surgical approaches that are often unsuccessful or are associated&#xD;
      with additional risks. As the incidence and prevalence of obesity and obesity-related&#xD;
      diseases are steadily increasing, there is a growing need to detect the key risk factors&#xD;
      involved in disease development and modify standard treatment procedures and protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most successful long-term strategy continues to be bariatric and metabolic surgeries,&#xD;
      such as sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP). The NIH recommends bariatric&#xD;
      surgery for participants with a BMI of 40 kg/m2 or greater or a BMI of 35 kg/m2 or greater&#xD;
      and obesity related comorbidities. These surgeries enable participants to lose between 50%&#xD;
      and 75% of excess body weight. Despite this success, participants are apprehensive and do not&#xD;
      undergo bariatric surgery with the biggest fear being the many complications that come with&#xD;
      the procedure. Studies have shown that 57-77% of participants are not interested in bariatric&#xD;
      surgery although the participants qualify.(16)&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the concern of complications from bariatric surgery, interest in endoscopic bariatric&#xD;
      techniques has increased over the years. The techniques have been shown to be efficacious,&#xD;
      reversible, relatively safe, and cost effective. Further, these techniques offer a&#xD;
      therapeutic window for some participants who may otherwise be unable to undergo bariatric&#xD;
      surgery. The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy have approved endoscopic&#xD;
      procedures, such as balloon therapy, for participants with BMI in the 30-40 kg/m2&#xD;
      range.(17,18) However, the products used in these therapies also have several limitations&#xD;
      primarily the inability to provide long term weight loss given the temporary nature of these&#xD;
      balloons.(19) Common adverse events following intragastric balloon insertion include&#xD;
      abdominal pain (33.7%), gastroesophageal reflux disease (18.3%), anorexia, and nausea (29%).&#xD;
      Severe complications such as gastric ulcers (2%), small bowel obstruction (0.3%), perforation&#xD;
      (0.1%), balloon migration (1.4%), and death (0.08%) are less common. Early balloon removal&#xD;
      occurred in 9.1% of the study participants due to participant intolerance.(20)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a pilot study to assess safety and efficacy (BEAT Obesity), 20 morbidly obese participants&#xD;
      with a BMI of ≥40 kg/m2 with no other comorbid conditions underwent bariatric embolization&#xD;
      and were followed for 12 months. Participants were embolized with 300-500 µm Embospheres.&#xD;
      None of the 20 participants in the BEAT Obesity trial (the largest prospective trial to date)&#xD;
      had any major adverse events. Any gastric ulcers that occurred (40%) were asymptomatic and&#xD;
      were completely healed by three months after the procedure.(21)&#xD;
&#xD;
      There were many limitations of this study including the absence of a control cohort and&#xD;
      non-compliance amongst study participants. A target population of participants with a BMI of&#xD;
      40 kg/m2 and above was too high considering the bariatric embolization procedure is&#xD;
      comparable to endoscopic bariatric therapies rather than bariatric surgery. BEAT Obesity&#xD;
      excluded participants with comorbidities, such as those who suffer from diabetes, who may&#xD;
      greatly benefit from this procedure and are often the target population for&#xD;
      endoscopic/surgical bariatric therapies. A larger bead size of 300-500 µm was specifically&#xD;
      chosen compared to preclinical data and prior clinical reports due to concerns of gastric&#xD;
      ischemia and ulceration. However, smaller bead size produces greater weight loss and hormonal&#xD;
      shifts.(22)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that transvascular bariatric embolization results in safe and&#xD;
      effective weight loss in obese participants compared to control subjects.&#xD;

      The BEATLES study is an investigator-initiated, prospective, double-blinded, randomized,&#xD;
      sham-controlled study that will assess the impact of bariatric embolization on the systemic&#xD;
      levels of obesity-related hormones and, as a consequence, on weight loss. The goal of this&#xD;
      study is to help treat obesity combining a lifestyle program and a minimally invasive,&#xD;
      angiographic (i.e., through blood vessels) approach.&#xD;

    <description>27 subjects will be enrolled in the bariatric embolization(BM) procedure arm. BM procedure will be performed under moderate sedation. Procedure will take 1.5 hr to 3 hr subject will be placed on the X-ray fluoroscopy table. Radial or femoral vascular access will be achieved using a small gauge needle, dilated over a guidewire to accommodate a 5 French vascular sheath. Standard catheters, 3 dimensional imaging will be acquired of the stomach, the arteries supplying the fundus arising off the celiac vessel. Microcatheter into the left gastric and/or gastroepiploic arteries supplying the fundus and small calibrated spheres will be infused until stasis of anterograde arterial flow is achieved, with particular care to avoid infusion of non-target arteries. The left gastric and/or gastroepiploic arteries will be embolized. Repeat 3 dimensional imaging: assess bead distribution and fundal coverage. Subject will be monitored in the recovery room and will be observed overnight.</description>
