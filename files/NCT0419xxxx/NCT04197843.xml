      Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding(AUGIB) is a common emergency. The NaviCam (ANKON) is a&#xD;
      miniaturised wireless endoscope in a single use capsule. It can be remotely controlled with&#xD;
      the patient in a magnetic console.. In patients with AUGIB, NaviCam has been compared to&#xD;
      conventional esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGD) in their diagnostic yields. NaviCam has been&#xD;
      shown to detect more lesions including those in the small bowel. There are therefore several&#xD;
      theoretical advantages to the use of NaviCam in the management of patients with AUGIB.An&#xD;
      initial NaviCam examination allows triaging of patients. Those with low risk lesions can be&#xD;
      discharged without EGD and hospital admission. These represent substantial reduction in&#xD;
      resource utilisation. In the diagnosis of small bowel lesions, the yield from a video capsule&#xD;
      examination is higher closer to the time of index bleed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the diagnostic yield of NaviCam in&#xD;
      patients who present with overt signs of AUGIB. In addition, the investigators aim to&#xD;
      determine if NaviCam examinations can reduce hospital resource utilisation and compare the&#xD;
      use of NaviCam as a triage tool to the use of risk scores such as the Glasgow Blatchford&#xD;
      Score (GBS). The investigators hypothesize that early NaviCam examination can allow safe&#xD;
      discharge of more patients when compared to GBS.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Background/ rationale Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (AUGIB) is a common&#xD;
      emergency. The incidence varies from 50 to 110 per 100,000 population. In the majority of&#xD;
      patients with AUGIB, bleeding is self-limiting and often has stopped spontaneously on&#xD;
      presentation. Traditionally patients undergo early endoscopy (within 24 hours) for the&#xD;
      purpose of finding the source of bleeding and if actively bleeding is seen from a lesion,&#xD;
      endoscopy hemostatic treatment is then applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NaviCam (ANKON) is a miniaturised wireless endoscope in a single use capsule. It can be&#xD;
      remotely controlled with the patient in a magnetic console. The operator to the&#xD;
      magnetic-driven NaviCam sits in a computer workstation and manipulates the capsule suspended&#xD;
      in a waterfilled stomach. After careful examination of the stomach, the capsule is then&#xD;
      allowed to passed through the pylorus into duodenum and small bowel. The patient wears&#xD;
      harness with small bowel imaging capabilities. In patients with AUGIB, NaviCam has been&#xD;
      compared to conventional esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGD) in their diagnostic yields.&#xD;
      NaviCam has been shown to detect more lesions including those in the small bowel. There are&#xD;
      therefore several theoretical advantages to the use of NaviCam in the management of patients&#xD;
      with AUGIB. First, the NaviCam procedure is well tolerated and in fact preferred by many&#xD;
      patients. It is convenient to administer. Second, NaviCam can in addition examine small&#xD;
      bowel. About 20% of patients with overt signs of AUGIB bleed from small bowel or colon. An&#xD;
      initial NaviCam examination allows triaging of patients. Those with low risk lesions can be&#xD;
      discharged without EGD and hospital admission. These represent substantial reduction in&#xD;
      resource utilisation. In the diagnosis of small bowel lesions, the yield from a video capsule&#xD;
      examination is higher closer to the time of index bleed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives The primary objective of the study is to determine the diagnostic yield of NaviCam&#xD;
      in patients who present with overt signs of AUGIB. In addition, the investigators aim to&#xD;
      determine if NaviCam examinations can reduce hospital resource utilisation and compare the&#xD;
      use of NaviCam as a triage tool to the use of risk scores such as the Glasgow Blatchford&#xD;
      Score (GBS). The investigators hypothesize that early NaviCam examination can allow safe&#xD;
      discharge of more patients when compared to GBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Study design The investigators plan to conduct a prospective cohort study at the&#xD;
      Prince of Wales Hospital, Shatin. The investigators enrol patients who present to the&#xD;
      Accident and Emergency Department with overt signs of AUGIB (hematemesis or melena) and are&#xD;
      hemodynamically stable (systolic blood pressure &gt; 100 mmHg and pulse less than 100 per&#xD;
      minute). The investigators intend to keep a log of all patients who present with AUGIB and&#xD;
      are being referred for EGD. The investigators record their admission Glasgow Blatchford&#xD;
      Score. The investigators exclude patients who are below the age of 18 and above 80 years,&#xD;
      those with permanent pacemakers and other metallic implants that preclude magnetic resonance&#xD;
      examinations, those with pharyngeal dysfunction that render them difficult to swallow, those&#xD;
      with poor conscious state with the concern of aspiration and patients known to have risks of&#xD;
      capsule retention e.g. previous gastric surgery, inflammatory bowel disease, patients who are&#xD;
      unable to provide an informed consent and those in pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are required to fast for 6 hours. Before the examination, the patient ingests 400 mg&#xD;
      simethicone dissolved in 100 ml of water to distend the stomach. He then drinks an addition&#xD;
      of one liter of water 10 minutes before the examination. An activated NaviCam (ANKON) is then&#xD;
      swallowed with the patient in a supine position in the MR console. This allows examination of&#xD;
      the esophagus and the squamo-columnar junction. An operator then drives the magnetic robot&#xD;
      and actively controls the capsule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stomach is examined according to a standardized protocol. (Figure 3) When the capsule&#xD;
      reaches the stomach, the capsule is lifted away from the posterior wall, rotated, and&#xD;
      advanced to the fundus (A), long shots (B), and close-ups (C) of the cardiac regions, and&#xD;
      then the posterior wall (D), the lesser and greater curvature (E) and anterior wall (F) of&#xD;
      the gastric body, followed by the angulus (G) and antrum (H) and finally the pylorus (I).&#xD;
      Full examination of the stomach is possible with patients lying in different positions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To enable transpyloric passage of the capsule, the capsule is oriented to obtain an en face&#xD;
      view of the pylorus. The capsule is directed towards the pylorus. With active peristalsis,&#xD;
      the capsule traverse across the pylorus. If this proves difficult, the patient is stood up&#xD;
      and asked to walk freely. The capsule then drops into the duodenum. The patient is instructed&#xD;
      to wear a jacket or harness with a data recorder. Real time examination of the duodenum is&#xD;
      possible. The small bowel examination is completed usually after the patient is discharged or&#xD;
      hospitalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's comfort level is recorded over a 10 cm visual analogue scale at the end of the&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decision to clinical admissions The decision to discharge the patient is left to the&#xD;
      discretion of the on-duty GI specialist after review of the video sequences. Criteria to&#xD;
      discharge include, Forrest IIc and III gastroduodenal ulcers, GI erosions together with&#xD;
      minimal coffee materials or a clean stomach, admission hemoglobin of 8 g/dl and haematocrit &gt;&#xD;
      0.24, good family support. Patients are discharged on appropriate medications e.g. a proton&#xD;
      pump inhibitor. Those discharged will be asked to return the data recorder the next day.&#xD;
      Patients are then reviewed by a GI specialist. Patients are also instructed to contact the on&#xD;
      duty GI specialist at the Prince of Wales Hospital should they have any query. In general, a&#xD;
      patient with a capsule examination that shows fresh blood in the GI tract, lesions with major&#xD;
      stigmata of bleeding, evidence of esophago-gastric or upper GI varices are admitted for&#xD;
      further management. Patients on anticoagulation therapy require to be admitted for titration&#xD;
      of these drugs. Patients with significant comorbid illnesses that would require in hospital&#xD;
      stabilisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables The investigators obtain patients' demographic data, medical history including&#xD;
      concurrent illnesses and current and past drug use, biochemical and hemodynamic data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators adopt a standardised pathology reporting scheme to minimize interobserver&#xD;
      reporting variability. Focal lesions were defined as peptic lesions (esophageal, gastric and&#xD;
      duodenal erosions, and ulcers), vascular lesions (angioectasia, esophageal varices of all&#xD;
      grades, gastric, and duodenal varices) and fresh/altered blood (without an obvious source).&#xD;
      Significant lesions were those considered to be the cause of bleeding and included peptic&#xD;
      ulcers (esophageal, gastric, and duodenal), esophageal varices of at least grade 2, and&#xD;
      gastric varices. In fact, the computer station has an Artificial intelligence function that&#xD;
      enables real time diagnosis of observed lesions and in addition the thoroughness and&#xD;
      percentage of stomach examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients are followed up till day 30 after inclusion into the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators intend to enrol 100 consecutive patients. No formal sample size is&#xD;
      calculated as this is considered a pilot study.&#xD;
