  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label phase 1 study to determine the safety and tolebility of oral ABSK021 in&#xD;
      patients with advanced solid tumor as well as the Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of oral&#xD;
      ABSK021. Preliminary antitumor activity will also be assessed.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will start with a dose escalation part of single-agent ABSK021 administered in&#xD;
      repeated 28-day cycles in patients with advanced solid for safety and tolerability. The&#xD;
      expansion part of oral ABSK021 at recommended dose of expansion (RDE) will be followed for&#xD;
      further evaluating safety and tolerability among selected tumor types. Preliminary antitumor&#xD;
      activity will also be assessed.&#xD;

    <description>Dose escalation of oral ABSK021 with a starting dose of 25mg once daily will be guided by&quot;3+3&quot; escalation rules based on safety data until an MTD has been identified or a RDE. For each dose, patients will first receive a single dose ABSK021 tablet(s) by mouth at Day -3 and be followed by a 3-day off as a run-in period to access the safety and PK of single-dose. Then, patients will continuously receive ABSK021 once daily (QD) in repeated 28-day cycles.</description>
