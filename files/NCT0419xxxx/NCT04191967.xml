  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, acceptability, and efficacy of&#xD;
      Thermocoagulation for treatment of precancerous lesions among HIV-positive women in a&#xD;
      screen-and-treat program in Western Kenya.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thermocoagulation is endorsed as an alternative to Cryotherapy for treatment of Visual&#xD;
      Inspection with Acetic Acid (VIA) or Human Papillomavirus (HPV)-positive women by the 2018&#xD;
      Kenya national cancer guidelines.32 Data primary from Western countries demonstrate similar&#xD;
      efficacy for the treatment of precancerous lesions between Cryotherapy and Thermocoagulation.&#xD;
      Data on safety, acceptability, and efficacy, particularly linked to gold-standard pathology,&#xD;
      among HIV-positive women in low-resource settings are scare. Given the demonstrated benefits&#xD;
      over cryotherapy including increased portability and availability hence easier&#xD;
      implementation, use of thermal coagulation for the treatment of precancerous lesions in low&#xD;
      resource settings could significantly improve access to treatment compared with cryotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to fill a critical data gap by evaluating the efficacy of thermocoagulation&#xD;
      among HIV-positive positive women using gold-standard biopsy for disease verification at&#xD;
      baseline and follow-up, as indicated. We will also assess the safety and acceptability of&#xD;
      this treatment modality among patients and providers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To evaluate the efficacy of thermal coagulation for the treatment of HIV-positive,&#xD;
      HPV-positive women by assessing rates of HPV persistence and CIN2/3 rate at 12 months after&#xD;
      treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To evaluate the safety and acceptability of thermal coagulation for treatment of&#xD;
      abnormal cervical lesions within a screen-and-treat program among HIV-positive women in&#xD;
      Western Kenya.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Evaluate provider acceptability of thermal coagulation for the treatment of&#xD;
      precancerous cervical lesion within a screen-and-treat program in Western Kenya.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of women with no evidence of cervical dysplasia at 12-months</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of women with no evidence of cervical dysplasia at 12-months follow-up, including 95% confidence intervals. We will extrapolate the rate of disease among those with normal colposcopy based on the rate of disease among the 25% in this group who will receive biopsy, and this will be incorporated in calculating persistence. We will perform a logistic regression to examine predictors of treatment success, using clinical and demographic variables as predictor variables.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of women with persistent HPV at 12-month follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will also report the rate of persistence of HPV at follow-up and compare with rates reported in the literature in this same population. We will compare efficacy rates for clearance of CIN2/3 to historical results following cryotherapy treatment in similar settings. A one-sample exact test will be used to compare the obtained efficacy proportion to that of historical controls.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Average pain score on the pain VAS</measure>
    <time_frame>Day of Treatment, approximately 1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The average pain score and confidence intervals will be calculated immediately after treatment, as reported using the Visual analog scale (VAS) for pain assessment. The pain VAS is a continuous scale comprised of a horizontal (HVAS) or vertical (VVAS) line, usually 10 centimeters (100 mm) in length, anchored by 2 verbal descriptors, one for each symptom extreme.&#xD;
The pain VAS is self-completed by the respondent. The respondent is asked to place a line perpendicular to the VAS line at the point that represents their pain intensity. Using a ruler, the score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) on the 10-cm line between the &quot;no pain&quot; anchor and the patient's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-100. A higher score indicates greater pain intensity. The following cut points on the pain VAS have been recommended: no pain (0-4 mm), mild pain (5-44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75- 100 mm) (11). Normative values are not available.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of Adverse Events (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 weeks following treatment</time_frame>
    <description>We will determine the proportion of women who experience grade 2 and 3 AEs, and severe adverse events (SAEs) during follow-up and calculate confidence intervals. Rates of AEs and SAEs will be compared to published rates for cryotherapy amongst this population (2.1% with mild pain or cramping, 1.6%with malodorous excessive vaginal discharge, 0.7% with mild bleeding or spotting, and no severe adverse events)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency of Patient Satisfaction Responses</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 weeks following treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction with thermocoagulation will be evaluated by determining the proportion of participants indicating a response of 'yes' to the question &quot;Do you feel satisfied with the treatment you received?&quot; with an alternative response of 'no' at the 4-6 week follow-up visit.</description>
