      Cerebral stroke (CS) remains one of the key issues of modern society, being a predominant&#xD;
      cause of deep and persistent disability of the population. Huge social and economic damage&#xD;
      arising from cerebrovascular diseases raises the problem of improving medical care for&#xD;
      strokes among the most relevant scientific and practical tasks of neurology Regulation of&#xD;
      energy metabolism is considered a powerful tool for acute conditions relief, including those&#xD;
      that occur due to acute impairment of cerebral blood flow. A number of adjuvant energy&#xD;
      protector concomitant medications with systemic pharmacodynamic properties based on signaling&#xD;
      (hormonal) and substrate mode of action of succinic acid and other mitochondrial substrates&#xD;
      and co-factors was created for this A significant role in the rehabilitation of patients who&#xD;
      underwent CS is assigned to the treatment of complications of care in the intensive care&#xD;
      unit, the so-called post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), which is a set of somatic,&#xD;
      neurological, social and psychological consequences of periods in intensive care unit (ICU)&#xD;
      conditions that bring limitations to the patient's daily activities In the Brain Institute&#xD;
      Clinic (Yekaterinburg), the first results of the metabolic status monitoring during physical&#xD;
      and cognitive exercise in patients with PICS were obtained. These results prove that control&#xD;
      over metabolic state holds the promise of developing approaches to increasing exercise&#xD;
      tolerance Taking into account the effectiveness of CFL in treatment of acute impairment of&#xD;
      cerebral circulation and consequences of cerebrovascular diseases, on the one hand, and its&#xD;
      classification as a metabotropic energy corrector, on the other hand, the evaluation of&#xD;
      Cytoflavin® medication tolerability in the integrated program of neurorehabilitation of&#xD;
      patients with PICS after ischemic stroke presents a significant interest.&#xD;
