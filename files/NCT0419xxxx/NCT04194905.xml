  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Pilot study will investigate the bioavailability in fasting women of 2 tablet&#xD;
      formulations containing Levonorgestrel 0.1 mg and Ethinyl estradiol 0.02 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Pilot study will be performed at a single site with 30 subjects. Participants will take 2&#xD;
      tablets of the test product and reference product in 2 periods and 2 sequences (either test&#xD;
      after reference or reference after test). There will be a washout of at least 14 days between&#xD;
      each study period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to investigate the relative bioavailability of&#xD;
      Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl estradiol of 2 tablet formulations with Levonorgestrel 0.1 mg and&#xD;
      Ethinyl estradiol 0.02 mg and to demonstrate bioequivalence of both formulations in terms of&#xD;
      rate and extent of absorption:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test Product: Product manufactured by Laboratorios Andrómaco S.A.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reference Product: Level [Trademark], product of Biolab Sanus Farmaceutica Ltda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 90% confidence intervals for the intra-subject coefficient of variation (Test versus&#xD;
      Reference Product) for the main pharmacokinetic parameters area under the plasma&#xD;
      concentration-time curve from time zero to time t (AUC0-t) and from time zero to 72 hours&#xD;
      (AUC0-72), and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) for total Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl&#xD;
      estradiol will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be confined in the study site for approximately 36 hours during each study&#xD;
      period (for 12 hours pre-dosing and for 24 hours post dosing) during which pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      (PK) blood samples will be obtained. 16 blood samples will be taken up to 24 hours after the&#xD;
      administration in each period. Participants will return to the site to provide additional&#xD;
      blood samples at 48 h, and 72 h postdose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The washout period between the two study periods will be at least 14 days. The samples from&#xD;
      each participant will be analyzed with 2 methods of high performance liquid&#xD;
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry bioanalytical assays to quantify total Levonorgestrel&#xD;
      and Ethinyl estradiol in plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety objective is to evaluate the tolerability of both formulations in women by&#xD;
      collecting adverse events.&#xD;
