  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of KRT-232 (AMG 232) when given&#xD;
      together with the standard chemotherapy drugs cytarabine and idarubicin in patients with&#xD;
      acute myeloid leukemia. KRT-232 (AMG 232) may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking a&#xD;
      protein called MDM2 that is needed for cell growth. Chemotherapy drugs, such as cytarabine&#xD;
      and idarubicin, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing&#xD;
      the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving KRT-232&#xD;
      (AMG 232) with cytarabine and idarubicin may stabilize cancer for longer when compared to&#xD;
      giving usual treatments alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the toxicities of MDM2 inhibitor AMG-232 (KRT-232 [AMG 232]), cytarabine and&#xD;
      idarubicin hydrochloride (idarubicin), and to determine the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of KRT-232 (AMG 232), cytarabine and idarubicin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK)&#xD;
      profiles of KRT-232 (AMG 232), cytarabine and idarubicin when used in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate p53 signaling induced by KRT-232 (AMG 232), cytarabine and idarubicin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To correlate KRT-232 (AMG 232), cytarabine and idarubicin exposure with pharmacodynamics&#xD;
      endpoints (efficacy, toxicity, changes in p53 signaling).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the response rate (RR) and progression free survival (PFS) of KRT-232 (AMG&#xD;
      232), cytarabine and idarubicin in acute myeloid leukemia (AML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate potential predictive biomarkers, including MTF2 and H3K27me3, of response to&#xD;
      KRT-232 (AMG 232), cytarabine and idarubicin in AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of KRT-232 and induction chemotherapy in&#xD;
      AML blasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of AMG 232.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive AMG 232 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-7, cytarabine intravenously&#xD;
      (IV) twice daily (BID) over 3 hours on days 1-7, and idarubicin IV over 10-15 minutes on days&#xD;
      1-3. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with residual disease may receive cytarabine IV BID over 3&#xD;
      hours for 5 days and idarubicin IV over 10-15 minutes for 2 days starting between days 14-21&#xD;
      of cycle 1 or the second cycle of AMG 232, cytarabine, and idarubicin. Patients who achieve a&#xD;
      complete response (CR) or a CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) in either cycle 1&#xD;
      or 2 may receive cytarabine IV BID over 3 hours on days 1, 3, and 5 for 3-4 additional 28 to&#xD;
      35-day cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3&#xD;
      months for 2 years, then every 6 months thereafter.&#xD;

    <description>Toxicity will be coded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. Based on the toxicity observed, a derived variable, the occurrence of dose limiting toxicity, will be created. Toxicities will be tabulated and reported according to dose level, grade, type, cycle, and attribution and, if numbers permit, by whether the patient had newly diagnosed or previously treated acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Cumulative incidence curves will be used to estimate the proportion of patients who will discontinue therapy for reasons of toxicity or general inability to tolerate the regimen. The data from all patients treated at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), will be combined for a final summary and listing of toxicities observed.</description>

             donation from initial study drug administration until 90 days after the last dose of&#xD;
             study drug. Adequate methods of effective birth control include sexual abstinence&#xD;
             (men, women); vasectomy; or a condom with spermicide (men) in combination with barrier&#xD;
             methods, hormonal birth control or intrauterine device (IUD) (women).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients with child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test&#xD;
             within 72 hours prior to the first study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
             Participants with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) who have a&#xD;
             legally-authorized representative (LAR) and/or family member available will also be&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy&#xD;
             (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 2) with the exception of alopecia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any other investigational or commercial agents or therapies&#xD;
             administered with the intention to treat their malignancy within 14 days of first&#xD;
             receipt of study drug with the exception of: Hydroxyurea (HU) in patients who need to&#xD;
             continue this agent to maintain white blood cell (WBC) count =&lt; 50,000/mm^3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;

             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because KRT-232 (AMG 232) is an MDM2&#xD;
             inhibiting agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because&#xD;
             there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary&#xD;
             to treatment of the mother with KRT-232 (AMG 232), breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with KRT-232 (AMG 232). These potential risks&#xD;
             may also apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;

          -  Positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HepBsAg) (indicative of chronic hepatitis B),&#xD;
             positive hepatitis total core antibody with negative HBsAG (suggestive of occult&#xD;
             hepatitis B), or detectable hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (RNA) by a&#xD;
             polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) assay (indicative of active hepatitis C - screening is&#xD;
             generally done by hepatitis C antibody [HepCAb], followed by hepatitis C virus RNA by&#xD;
             PCR if HepCAb is positive).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All herbal medicines (e.g., St. John's wort), vitamins, and supplements consumed by&#xD;
             the subject within the 30 days prior to receiving the first dose of AMG 232, and&#xD;
             continuing use, if applicable, will be reviewed by the principal investigator.&#xD;
             Patients may continue to take all herbal medicines (e.g., St. John's wort), vitamins,&#xD;
             and supplements if approved by the principal investigator.&#xD;

             astemizole, cisapride, dihydroergotamine, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, or&#xD;
             terfanide) within the 14 days prior to receiving the first dose of AMG 232 is not&#xD;
             permitted. Other medications (such as fentanyl and oxycodone) may be allowed per&#xD;
             investigator's assessment/evaluation. Use of any known CYP2C8 substrates with a narrow&#xD;
             therapeutic window within the 14 days prior to receiving the first dose of KRT-232&#xD;
             (AMG 232) is not permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any medications considered inhibitors or substrates of UGT1A1, or inhibitors or&#xD;
             inducers of P-glycoprotein (gp) are not permitted. Caution should be used with&#xD;
             concomitant antacids or proton pump inhibitor (PPI) products.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery within 28 days of study day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of warfarin, factor Xa inhibitors and direct thrombin inhibitors. Note:&#xD;
             Low molecular weight heparin and prophylactic low dose warfarin are permitted. PT/PTT&#xD;
             must meet the inclusion criteria. Subjects taking warfarin must have their INR&#xD;
             followed closely.&#xD;
