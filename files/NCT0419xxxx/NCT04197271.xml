  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acutely symptomatic abdominal wall hernia can cause many symptoms and complications. They can&#xD;
      be associated with levels of morbidity beyond that seen in emergency laparotomy. There is&#xD;
      limited data to guide practice in this field. This observational cohort study will explore&#xD;
      variation in practice around assessment, repair and outcomes of hernias treated in the&#xD;
      emergency setting.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are many different types of hernia, with the most common being in the groin or at the&#xD;
      umbilicus. Hernias affect a significant proportion of the population and can vary from&#xD;
      producing no symptoms at all, to causing a blockage to the bowel that requires urgent&#xD;
      surgery. Hernias affect people of all ages and degrees of health, but become increasingly&#xD;
      common with age. As our population ages and therefore becomes generally more unwell, the&#xD;
      risks of surgery increase. Recent evidence suggests that emergency hernia repair is&#xD;
      associated with worse outcomes than planned procedures. At present there are limited&#xD;
      guidelines for the management of acutely symptomatic hernias and therefore practice varies&#xD;
      between hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This cohort study will capture information on patients treated in the UK for acutely&#xD;
      symptomatic hernia, and will provide information on variation in assessment, and technical&#xD;
      aspects of repair. It will also capture health utility data out to 90 days post discharge&#xD;
      from hospital.&#xD;
