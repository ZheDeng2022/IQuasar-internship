      Subjects will undergo a 14-day outpatient, standard therapy phase during which sensor and&#xD;
      insulin data will be collected. This will be followed by a 94-day (13-week) hybrid&#xD;
      closed-loop phase conducted in an outpatient setting and an optional 12-month extension&#xD;

      The study schedule will consist of a standard therapy data collection phase followed by a&#xD;
      hybrid closed-loop phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo a 14-day outpatient, standard therapy phase during which sensor and&#xD;
      insulin data will be collected. Subjects, or their caregivers, will manage their diabetes at&#xD;
      home per their usual routine using the study continuous glucose monitoring system (CGM) and&#xD;
      remain on current multiple daily injections (MDI) or pump therapy. This will be followed by a&#xD;
      94-day (13-week) hybrid closed-loop phase, conducted in an outpatient setting where subjects,&#xD;
      or their caregivers, will manage their diabetes at home using the Omnipod Horizon™ Automated&#xD;
      Glucose Control System. After completing the 94-day hybrid closed-loop phase, subjects will&#xD;
      have the option to continue using the system for an additional 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the hybrid closed-loop phase, there will be supervised exercise challenges. A subset&#xD;
      of subjects will participate in 5-days of supervised Meal and Exercise challenges. A subset&#xD;
      of subjects will participate in 3-days of supervised HypoProtect Exercise challenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hybrid closed-loop phase will begin on Study Day 1.&#xD;
