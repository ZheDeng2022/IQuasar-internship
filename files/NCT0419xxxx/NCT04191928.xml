  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study investigators will examine the absorption characteristics of apixaban, a direct-acting&#xD;
      oral anticoagulation, in patients who have underwent a particular kind of surgery&#xD;
      (pancreaticoduodenectomy) which involves resection of the duodenum.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine apixaban pharmacokinetic exposure (AUC(0-24)) and maximum&#xD;
      concentration (Cmax) when administered as a single oral dose in patients who have undergone&#xD;
      pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) compared to historical controls. This is a phase one, single&#xD;
      dose pharmacokinetic study in stable patients who have undergone pancreaticoduodenectomy.&#xD;
      Apixaban is an orally administered highly selective factor Xa inhibitor, belonging to the&#xD;
      class of direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOAC) along with rivaroxoban and edoxaban. Factor&#xD;
      Xa is an essential mediator of the clotting pathway in humans. Apixaban is currently approved&#xD;
      by the FDA for treatment of VTE, prophylaxis of DVT in patients undergoing knee and hip&#xD;
      replacement surgeries and for reducing the risk of embolic stroke and systemic embolism in&#xD;
      patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. This study aims to compare the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and absorption of oral apixaban in patients who have undergone&#xD;
      pancreaticoduodenectomy to that of apixaban in historical controls.&#xD;
