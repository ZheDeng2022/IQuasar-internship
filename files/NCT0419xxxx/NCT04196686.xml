    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of different technologies, Virtual&#xD;
      Reality and Augmented Reality with modifications as passive content, active content,&#xD;
      cognitive load modulation, and positive encouragement coaching to increase the pain threshold&#xD;
      as assessed by immersing a hand in ice water.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Hand in Ice Bath</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of ice bath (approximately 0 - 4 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>Given that the cold pressor test produces an uncomfortable experience, we considered longer duration within the ice bath to represent increased pain tolerance. Measured in seconds (s).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sensory perception duration</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of ice bath (0- 4 minutes max)</time_frame>
    <description>Biosensors collect time of hand immersed in ice bath in minutes and seconds</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain tolerance</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of ice bath (approximately 0 - 4 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>During ice bath data collection participants will be asked to report pain on a numeric rating scale from 0-10, 0 being no pain and 10 being worst pain imaginable every 30 seconds during ice bath</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Skin conductance response density (SCRD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of ice bath (approximately 0 - 4 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>The effects of VR on modulating sympathetic response in the presence of painful stimuli, was assessed by analyzing SCRD per 30 second interval. We refer to each of these 30 second intervals as a separate epoch. Skin conductance is expected to increase with increasing sympathetic nervous system activity, as sympathetic activity increases sweat secretion to increase skin conductance.</description>

    <description>Up to 250 participants will place hand in ice bath captured without the use of VR/AR and keep hand submerged as long as they can withstand the cold or until 4 minutes have elapsed, whichever comes first. Participants will not be told of the specifics of the time limit, to avoid competitiveness and expectations and will be asked for pain scores every 30 seconds.This will be done with both dominant and non-dominant hand.</description>
