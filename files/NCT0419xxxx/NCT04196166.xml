  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The &quot;routine&quot; pre-operative tests in healthy orthopaedic patients undergoing intermediate/&#xD;
      major surgery are not justified. In this study of 670 healthy orthopedic patients with 7610&#xD;
      preoperative tests, investigators found that surgical plan was influenced in &lt;1% of patients.&#xD;
      Surgeons should be sensitized to reconsider this practice particularly with limited&#xD;
      resources.&#xD;

      Background: Routine preoperative tests in healthy patients not only cause extra anxiety, but&#xD;
      may delay treatment without influencing surgical plan. This has worse impact in&#xD;
      resource-constrained settings where fee for service rather than health insurance is the usual&#xD;
      norm. Investigators aim to determine if &quot;routine&quot; pre-operative tests are justified in&#xD;
      healthy orthopedic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Investigators conducted a non-commercialized, non-funded matched case control study&#xD;
      in tertiary care university hospital and a level-1 trauma centre for healthy patients&#xD;
      (ASA-1&amp;2) admitted from January 2014-December 2016 for elective orthopedic intermediate and&#xD;
      major procedures. Cases (patient who had a change in his/her surgical plan after admission)&#xD;
      and controls were selected independently of the exposure of interest then matched randomly to&#xD;
      cases on age, gender and procedure type. Primary exposure was the routine preoperative lab&#xD;
      tests, as defined by the American Society of Anesthesiologist, which included 13 blood tests.&#xD;
      Analysis was done using Principle Component Analysis and Conditional logistic regression at&#xD;
      univariate and multivariable levels reporting matched adjusted Odds Ratios. The data will&#xD;
      bereported in line with STROBE criteria.&#xD;
