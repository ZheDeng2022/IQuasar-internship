  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      JS002 is a recombinant humanized Anti- PCSK9 monoclonal antibody; This is a phase Ia,&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of a single subcutaneous injection of JS002 in healthy&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the dose ascending design includes five dose level cohorts (15 mg, 50 mg, 150&#xD;
      mg, 300 mg, and 450 mg) administered by subcutaneous injection, and three intravenous&#xD;
      administration cohorts (15 mg, 150 mg, and 450 mg). Each cohort will enroll 8 to 12 subjects&#xD;
      (distribution of study drug and placebo in a 3:1 ratio).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the study is 84-day per subjects.&#xD;
