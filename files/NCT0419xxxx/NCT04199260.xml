      Observational clinical study, national, multicentric, prospective, non-comparative, with&#xD;

      300 patients will be included in approximately 50 Spanish sites. The study comprehend a&#xD;
      maximum of 3 visits. At visit 1, patient's writted informed consent will be collected,&#xD;
      patient's selection critera will be checked, and patient's medial history data will be&#xD;
      collected. At visit 2, 6 months after the first visit, the primary and secondary objectives&#xD;
      will be evaluated. For those patients who finish treatment after 6 months, this will be the&#xD;
      final visit. Only in that cases where, by usual clinical practice, the doctor indicates&#xD;
      patient should continue under treatment, visit 3, wich will take place 12 months after&#xD;
      streatment stars, will be the last visit for the patient under study.&#xD;

        The main objective of the study is to evaluate the degree of normalization of cytological&#xD;
        abnormalities of the cervix caused by HPV. For this purpose, women over 25 years old with&#xD;
        positive HPV with lesions in the cervical mucosa, and concordant colposcopic image have&#xD;
        been chosen as the target population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No exceptional measures are planned for the recruitment of patients in this study.&#xD;
