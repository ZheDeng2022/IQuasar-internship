  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In India, one of the fast growing countries, 53% of all women have anaemia as per the&#xD;
      National Family Health Survey. A recently published study on the burden of disease in India&#xD;
      concluded that the burden of Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is 3 times higher than the average&#xD;
      globally for other geographies at a similar level of development, and that women are&#xD;
      disproportionately affected. Finger Millet (Eleusine coracana), more commonly known as Ragi,&#xD;
      is a type of a millet crop grown in India, is considerably rich in minerals and its&#xD;
      micronutrient density is higher than that of the world's major cereal grains: rice and wheat.&#xD;
      Ragi also contains different antinutrients such as phytates and polyphenols, which have been&#xD;
      known to have an inhibiting effect on the absorption of iron. On an average, white finger&#xD;
      millet contains 0.04-0.09% polyphenols and brown varieties have 0.08-3.47%. The dark variety&#xD;
      of ragi is the most widely consumed type. The white ragi is the lesser consumed type.&#xD;
      However, the levels of polyphenols, which inhibit the absorption of iron, are ten times lower&#xD;
      in the white ragi as compared to the dark ragi. Thus, it is important to evaluate the extent&#xD;
      of inhibition of the polyphenols on the iron absorption. This information would be beneficial&#xD;
      for policy making and promotion of cultivation of the type of ragi that could be most&#xD;
      effective for the consumers&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Finger Millet (Eleusine coracana), more commonly known as Ragi, is a type of a millet crop&#xD;
      grown in India, including other countries especially in East Africa. Ragi has been perceived&#xD;
      as a potential &quot;super cereal&quot; by the United States National Academies being one of the most&#xD;
      nutritious among all major cereals. From the nutritional perspective, finger millet is&#xD;
      considerably rich in minerals and its micronutrient density is higher than that of the&#xD;
      world's major cereal grains: rice and wheat .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Millets (Ragi or finger millet and Jowar or sorghum) were consumed by 59% of rural and 28% of&#xD;
      urban population in Karnataka. Ragi consumption was seen predominantly in south Karnataka&#xD;
      with 27% of rural and 17% of urban population reporting consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ragi is the richest source of calcium among cereals with up to 10-fold higher calcium content&#xD;
      than brown rice, wheat or maize and three times than that of milk. It is also rich in iron&#xD;
      and fiber, making this crop more nutritive as compared to other most commonly used cereals.&#xD;
      Finger millet is enriched in the essential amino acids like lysine and methionine which are&#xD;
      important in human health and growth but remain absent from most other plant foods . In&#xD;
      addition, it also contains useful amounts of the two polyunsaturated fatty acids- linoleic&#xD;
      acid and Î±-linolenic acid , metabolized products of which facilitate normal development of&#xD;
      the central nervous system. Despite the well-documented health benefits of finger millet,&#xD;
      only a limited progress has been made in context to its nutraceutical applications as&#xD;
      functional food. Although, it may have remained underutilized by the general population due&#xD;
      to either unawareness or apprehension, its immense potential for enhancing the nutritional&#xD;
      and therapeutic attributes by acting as functional food cannot be ignored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ragi also contains different antinutrients such as phytates and polyphenols, which have been&#xD;
      known to have an inhibiting effect on the absorption of iron. On an average, white finger&#xD;
      millet contains 0.04-0.09% polyphenols and brown varieties have 0.08-3.47% . It was found&#xD;
      that found proto-catechuic acid (45.0 mg/100 g) is the major free phenolic acid in ragi. In&#xD;
      another study of total phenolic compounds in finger millet, it was found to have 85% benzoic&#xD;
      acid derivatives (gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid,&#xD;
      syringic acid) while rest of the fraction were either cinnamic acid derivatives (ferulic&#xD;
      acid, trans-cinnamic acid, p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, sinapic acid) or flavonoids&#xD;
      (quercetin, Proanthocyanidins like condensed tannins) . Among bound phenloic acids, ferulic&#xD;
      and p-coumaric acid are the major fractions and account for 64-96 and 50-99% of total ferulic&#xD;
      and p-coumaric acid content of finger millet grains, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dark variety of ragi is the most widely consumed type. The white ragi is the lesser&#xD;
      consumed type. However, the levels of polyphenols, which inhibit the absorption of iron, are&#xD;
      ten times lower in the white ragi as compared to the dark ragi. Thus, it is important to&#xD;
      evaluate the extent of inhibition of the polyphenols on the iron absorption. This information&#xD;
      would be beneficial for policy making and promotion of cultivation of the type of ragi that&#xD;
      could be most effective for the consumers&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study duration will be 26 days from the first day of the first meal administration till&#xD;
      the last blood withdrawal . For each appointment, the participants will spend about 30&#xD;
      minutes at the Human Nutrition Laboratory at ETH Zurich, between 7 and 9 am for breakfast&#xD;
      meal consisting of pancakes made out of the ragi. the white ragi meal and the black ragi meal&#xD;
      will be extrinsically labelled with isotopes 57 Fe and 58 Fe respectively. The participants&#xD;
      will consume the ragi meal as breakfast. The first type of ragi meal will be given for 5&#xD;
      consecutive days,. They will have a weekend break of two days (during which they will resume&#xD;
      their usual eating habits). After that, they will consume the second test meal as breakfast&#xD;
      for another five consecutive days. Thus, there will be 10 meals in total. The breakfast meals&#xD;
      will be consumed between 7 and 9 am together with a glass of 300 mL bottled water after which&#xD;
      they have to wait another 3 hours before they can consume anything. The procedure will remain&#xD;
      the same for all the days. Participants will always be asked to fast the day before coming&#xD;
      for the feeding, that is, no food intake after 8 pm and no beverage intake after midnight the&#xD;
      evening before. On day of screening, day 1 and the end point day 26 of the study, blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected after an overnight fast for the determination of Hb, PF, CRP and&#xD;
      isotopic ratio&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study will have a randomized, cross-over design and will be conducted at the Human Nutrition Laboratory, ETH Zurich (scientific responsibility). From an initial screening of 150 women, 25 non-pregnant non-lactating women with a marginal iron status (PF &lt;25 ng/ml) will be recruited. In total, participants will consume the 2 intervention products in a random, balanced order. Participants will consume the first intervention product as a breakfast meal for 5 days in a week, and the second intervention product as a breakfast meal as well for 5 days the following week. A blood sample will be collected 14 days after the last meal administration day which will be used to measure the shift in the isotopic ratio</intervention_model_description>
