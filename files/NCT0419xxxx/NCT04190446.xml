  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects of radiation therapy (hypofractionated proton&#xD;
      beam therapy or IMRT) for the treatment of prostate cancer that has come back (recurrent) or&#xD;
      that has spread to a limited number of sites (oligometastatic) following primary localized&#xD;
      treatment. Hypofractionated proton beam radiation therapy delivers smaller doses of radiation&#xD;
      therapy over time and may kill more tumor cells and have fewer side effects. IMRT uses high&#xD;
      energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. This trial is being done to find out if&#xD;
      a shorter course of radiation therapy is better with fewer side effects for patients with&#xD;
      recurrent prostate cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess late &gt;= grade 3 gastrointestinal (GI) and/or genitourinary (GU) toxicity of&#xD;
      interest with the hypofractionated regimen with proton beam therapy or intensity-modulated&#xD;
      radiation therapy (IMRT) (late defined as 3 to 24 months after protocol radiation therapy&#xD;
      [RT]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Late grade &gt;= 2 GI and/or GU toxicities of interest within 24 months after the protocol&#xD;
      RT, using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v)4.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Acute grade &gt;= 3 GI and/or GU toxicities of interest during and within 3 months after the&#xD;
      protocol RT, using the CTCAE v4.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Compare the rates of late &gt;= grade 3 GI and/or GU toxicity between the 2 treatment&#xD;
      schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients undergo proton beam radiation therapy 5 days a week over 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients undergo IMRT 5 days a week over 5 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 3-6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54,&#xD;
      and 60 months.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 24 months after RT</time_frame>
    <description>Toxicity will be defined as an adverse event possibly, probably, or definitely related to proton beam therapy. The proportion of grade 3 or higher GI or GU toxicities will be estimated by the number of patients with a late grade 3 or higher GI or GU toxicity divided by the total number of evaluable patients. Exact binomial 90% confidence intervals for the toxicity proportion will be calculated.</description>

    <description>The rate of &gt;= grade 3 GI or GU acute adverse events will be estimated by the number of patients with a &gt;= grade 3 GI or GU acute adverse event divided by the total number of evaluable patients.

    <description>The rate of &gt;= grade 2 GI or GU late adverse events will be estimated by the number of patients with a &gt;= grade 2 GI or GU late adverse event divided by the total number of evaluable patients.

    <measure>Proportion of grade 3 or higher GI or GU adverse events</measure>

    <measure>Incidence of adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>All eligible patients that have initiated treatment will be considered evaluable for assessing adverse event rate(s). The maximum grade for each type of adverse event will be recorded for each patient, and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine patterns. Additionally, the relationship of the adverse event(s) to the study treatment will be taken into consideration. Acute and late adverse events will be summarized separately.</description>
