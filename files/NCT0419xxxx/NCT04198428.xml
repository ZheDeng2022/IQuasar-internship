    <textblock>
      Through CTN-0076-Ot (Clinical Decision Support for Opioid Use Disorders in Medical Settings:&#xD;
      Pilot Usability Testing in an EMR (COMPUTE)), our team has iteratively developed and piloted&#xD;
      a web-based and electronic health record (EHR)-integrated Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) Clinical&#xD;
      Decision Support (CDS) system to offer expert guidance to primary care providers (PCPs) on&#xD;
      the diagnosis and management of OUD. The OUD-CDS has been implemented within the EPIC EHR of&#xD;
      one large care system and was piloted with 55 providers to ensure content validity and&#xD;
      provider satisfaction. The team will now implement this OUD-CDS in a large multi-site&#xD;
      clinic-randomized controlled trial to evaluate its impact on practice process measures and&#xD;
      patient outcomes. The investigators also aim to prepare for scalability (i.e., integration&#xD;
      into usual primary care practice after the study is complete) and dissemination by evaluating&#xD;
      facilitators and barriers to implementation, determining the costs of implementation and&#xD;
      maintenance, and assessing the short-term cost impacts of the OUD-CDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include three large diverse care systems and randomize a minimum of 30 clinics&#xD;
      to receive the OUD-CDS intervention or usual care (UC). In intervention clinics, the OUD-CDS&#xD;
      will identify patients who are at high risk for OUD or diagnosed with OUD; use data stored in&#xD;
      the EHR for each eligible patient to assemble treatment recommendations tailored to each&#xD;
      patient's current needs; display these recommendations to PCPs via the OUD-CDS user&#xD;
      interface; and store analytic data from all targeted visits. In UC clinics, the OUD-CDS will&#xD;
      run invisibly in the background to identify high-risk or OUD patients, assemble treatment&#xD;
      recommendations tailored to each eligible patient's needs, and store analytic data from all&#xD;
      targeted visits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will include 3 large diverse healthcare systems and randomize a minimum of&#xD;
      30 clinics equally within each system to receive the OUD-CDS intervention or UC. In&#xD;
      intervention and UC clinics, the OUD-CDS will identify study-eligible patients, those who are&#xD;
      at high risk for OUD or diagnosed with OUD; and will use data stored in the EHR to assemble&#xD;
      treatment recommendations tailored to the needs of each study-eligible patient. In&#xD;
      intervention clinics, these treatment recommendations will be displayed via the OUD-CDS user&#xD;
      interface. Finally, data from all targeted visits in all randomized clinics will be stored in&#xD;
      a data repository for analysis and reporting needs. The targeted visits for each&#xD;
      study-eligible patient in all randomized clinics will be the index visit, the first visit at&#xD;
      which the OUD-CDS identifies that the patient is study eligible, and all post-index visits&#xD;
      through the end of the intervention period, regardless of continued eligibility. This&#xD;
      pragmatic cluster-randomized design is the optimal design to effectively and efficiently&#xD;
      implement this tool in primary care clinics while protecting against study contamination and&#xD;
      allowing for collection of process and outcome data at UC clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mixed Methods Approach: Virtually every evidence-based intervention in medicine has turned&#xD;
      out to be difficult to implement and maintain in real life practice and to fall far short of&#xD;
      fidelity to the process used in randomized trials. As a result, a whole new field of&#xD;
      dissemination and implementation research has been developing over the last 20 years. These&#xD;
      studies have now gone well beyond the previous paradigm of focusing on changing the attitudes&#xD;
      and behaviors of individual physicians to a growing awareness that the need instead is to&#xD;
      alter the environment in which physicians work so that it is easier to do the desired&#xD;
      evidence-based thing than to stick with old established habit patterns. That means focusing&#xD;
      change efforts on organizational factors and practice systems. The Solberg conceptual&#xD;
      framework has proven to be particularly helpful in clarifying this new approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simultaneously, there has been increasing interest in transitioning effectiveness clinical&#xD;
      trials from traditionally highly selective and controlled circumstances to pragmatic trials&#xD;
      that make use of normal care delivery processes and patients.[35] The measurement of such&#xD;
      trials has been facilitated by the development of a conceptual framework called RE-AIM, an&#xD;
      acronym for 5 key facets of such studies - Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation,&#xD;
      and Maintenance. Recently, the developers of RE-AIM have recognized the need for more&#xD;
      flexible use of this framework, greater use of qualitative methods to understand why&#xD;
      interventions are not used consistently, and making adaptations in the implementation&#xD;
      approach based on such understandings. The investigators propose to use the RE-AIM framework&#xD;
      to guide (1) a monitoring system for intervention problems, (2) a mixed methods evaluation of&#xD;
      the reasons for those problems, and (3) modification of the intervention to reduce those&#xD;
      problems. These steps will be reiterated in a cyclic fashion, resulting in a more&#xD;
      sophisticated approach to the long-standing quality improvement emphasis on Plan-Do-Study-Act&#xD;
      rapid cycle tests of change. Furthermore, the team will take advantage of the staggered&#xD;
      implementation of the study through three different care systems to ensure that the solutions&#xD;
      for intervention problems in Site 1 are not assumed to be the same as the approach in&#xD;
      subsequent sites without further RE-AIM monitoring and evaluation.&#xD;
