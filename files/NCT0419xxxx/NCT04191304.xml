  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, randomised, double-blind (DB), parallel-group, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      24-week Phase 3 study to compare the efficacy and safety of benralizumab versus placebo&#xD;
      administered by SC injection Q4W in patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES). This&#xD;
      study comprises 2 distinct periods (together defined as the 'main study'): A 24-week, DB&#xD;
      treatment period, during which patients will be randomised to receive either benralizumab or&#xD;
      placebo, in addition to prior stable HES background therapy, and an open-label (OLE)&#xD;
      treatment period, during which all patients will receive benralizumab. Patients will not&#xD;
      continue to be recruited after 47 patients have had their first HES worsening/flare.The&#xD;
      primary database lock (DBL) will occur when at least 47 patients have had their first HES&#xD;
      worsening/flare event and all randomised patients have been followed up for the 24-week DB&#xD;
      treatment period. The target patient population is male and female patients 12 years of age&#xD;
      and older with symptomatic active HES. Approximately 120 eligible patients will be randomised&#xD;
      at a 1:1 ratio to receive either benralizumab or matching placebo&#xD;

    <masking_description>All eligible patients will be centrally randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either benralizumab or placebo. Randomisation will be done using an IWRS/IVRS.&#xD;
Benralizumab and placebo will not be visually distinct from each other. All packaging and labelling of the IP will be done in such a way as to ensure blinding for all Sponsor and investigational site staff. Neither the patient nor any of the Investigators or Sponsor staff who are involved in the treatment, clinical evaluation, and monitoring of the patients will be aware of the treatment received. Since benralizumab and placebo are not visually distinct, IP will be handled by an appropriately qualified member of the study team (e.g., pharmacist, Investigator, or designee) at the site.</masking_description>

             secondary cause on 2 examinations [interval ≥1 month; Valent et al 2012] and evidence&#xD;
             of end organ manifestations attributable to the eosinophilia).&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Corticosteroid responsiveness defined as an AEC &lt;1000 cells/μL after a 2-day course of&#xD;
             OCS 1 mg/kg/day at Visit 2 (assessed by local laboratory).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must agree to use a highly effective method of&#xD;
             birth control (confirmed by the Investigator) from enrolment, throughout the study&#xD;

             pregnancy test result on Visit 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Life-threatening HES and/or HES complication(s) as judged by the Investigator:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Medical intervention for HES-related life-threatening event(s) within 12 weeks&#xD;
                  prior to randomisation OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. History of thrombotic complications, stroke, or significant cardiac damage&#xD;
                  related to HES, if the respective events were life threatening and currently&#xD;
                  represent a risk of life-threatening disease complications. Events that occurred&#xD;
                  in the past but considered resolved or stable, can be accepted if, as per&#xD;
                  Investigator's judgment participation in the study will not put the patient at&#xD;
                  risk&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Disease severity that, in the opinion of the Investigator, makes the patient&#xD;
                  inappropriate for inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Presence of FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion tyrosine kinase gene translocation or other known&#xD;
             imatinib-sensitive mutation.&#xD;

          3. Definitive diagnosis of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Known, pre-existing, clinically significant endocrine, autoimmune, metabolic,&#xD;
             neurological, renal, gastrointestinal, hepatic, haematological, respiratory, or any&#xD;
             other system abnormalities that are not associated with HES and are uncontrolled with&#xD;
             standard treatment which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may put the patient at&#xD;
             risk because of his/her participation in the study, or may influence the results of&#xD;
             the study, or the patient's ability to complete the entire duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Hypereosinophilia of unknown significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Cardiovascular: Documented history of any clinically significant cardiac damage,&#xD;
             clinically significant echocardiography (if available) or ECG findings within 12&#xD;
             months prior to Visit 1 or clinically significant ECG findings at screening that, in&#xD;
             the opinion of the Investigator, may put the patients at risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Known currently active liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Chronic stable hepatitis B and C (including positive testing for hepatitis B&#xD;
                  surface antigen or hepatitis C antibody) or other stable chronic liver disease&#xD;
                  are acceptable if patient otherwise meets eligibility criteria. Stable chronic&#xD;
                  liver disease should generally be defined by the absence of ascites,&#xD;
                  encephalopathy, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia, oesophageal or gastric varices, or&#xD;
                  persistent jaundice, or cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level ≥3× the&#xD;
                  upper limit of normal (ULN) during the screening period (AST or ALT &gt;5×ULN if&#xD;
                  documented HES with liver manifestations). Transient increase of AST/ALT level&#xD;
                  that resolves by the time of randomisation is acceptable if, in the&#xD;
                  Investigator's opinion, the patient does not have an active liver disease and&#xD;
                  meets other eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Current malignancy, or history of malignancy, except:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patients who have had basal cell carcinoma, localised squamous cell carcinoma of&#xD;
                  the skin, or in situ carcinoma of the cervix are eligible provided the patient is&#xD;
                  in remission and curative therapy was completed at least 12 months prior to the&#xD;
                  date that informed consent, and assent when applicable, was obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Patients who have had other malignancies are eligible provided the patient is in&#xD;
                  remission and curative therapy was completed at least 5 years prior to the date&#xD;
                  informed consent, and assent when applicable, was obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Chronic or ongoing active infections requiring systemic treatment, as well as&#xD;
             clinically significant viral, bacterial, or fungal infection within 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             Visit 1.&#xD;
