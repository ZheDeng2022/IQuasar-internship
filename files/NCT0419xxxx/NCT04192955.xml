    <textblock>
      This trial is a is a prospective, randomized (1:1) placebo-controlled, clinical trial with&#xD;
      blinded endpoint assessment of 440 participants with unruptured brain aneurysm planned for&#xD;
      endovascular treatment using coiling-only approach (primary coiling or using&#xD;
      balloon-assistance but not stenting) to test if oral acetylsalicylic acid (325 mg/ day for a&#xD;
      total of 5 days) is superior placebo in preventing clinical and silent strokes. The primary&#xD;
      outcome is a clinical or silent stroke at the time of discharge assessed by clinical&#xD;
      examination and MRI brain. Participants will return to the clinic or be contacted by phone&#xD;
      for the end of study procedures on Day 90 to collect functional outcome data.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endovascular aneurysm treatment has become the mainstay of treatment of unruptured brain&#xD;
      aneurysms. Since the introduction of Guglielmi detachable coils in the late 1980s, thousands&#xD;
      of procedures are performed annually worldwide. The expanding endovascular armamentarium with&#xD;
      the use of balloon-assisted coiling, stents (either in stent-assisted coiling or&#xD;
      flow-diversion), and unassisted coiling-only procedures made it possible to treat aneurysms&#xD;
      of almost all intracranial locations, shapes, and sizes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thromboembolic complications are potential adverse events whenever catheters are introduced&#xD;
      into the intracranial arteries. Diagnostic and interventional neurological procedures, such&#xD;
      as diagnostic and therapeutic cerebral angiograms may lead to ischemic strokes of varying&#xD;
      frequency and severity. Luckily, most of the thromboembolic events do not cause a clinical&#xD;
      stroke. Instead, tiny infarction signals are seen on Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (DWI MRI) of the brain without neurological signs or symptoms. These are often&#xD;
      labelled as silent (or covert) strokes. These imaging surrogates have been used to compare&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of various endovascular procedures and techniques. In a Canadian&#xD;
      cohort, heparin bolus during aneurysm coiling was associated with significantly less DWI load&#xD;
      on post-coiling MRI. This supports the notion that most of these lesions are caused by&#xD;
      thrombi, as opposed to bubbles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is limited direction from available guidelines regarding the use of anticoagulation or&#xD;
      antiplatelet agents to prevent thromboembolic complications associated with endovascular&#xD;
      treatment of brain aneurysms. This resulted in huge variability of the protocols used for&#xD;
      anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapies before, during and after coil embolization of&#xD;
      brain aneurysms. Most of the current practices are extrapolated from coronary literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet inhibition is an effective strategy to minimize the rate of thromboembolism.&#xD;
      Antiplatelet treatment has been routinely used before coronary angioplasty to reduce the risk&#xD;
      of thromboembolic events. The different action of ASA from that of anticoagulants gives it an&#xD;
      additive effect to heparin alone in neuro-interventional procedures. This notion is supported&#xD;
      by observations from multiple retrospective and prospective studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will perform a prospective, randomized (1:1) placebo-controlled, clinical trial with&#xD;
      blinded endpoint assessment of 440 participants with unruptured brain aneurysm planned for&#xD;
      endovascular treatment using coiling-only approach (primary coiling or using&#xD;
      balloon-assistance but not stenting) to test if oral acetylsalicylic acid (325 mg/ day for a&#xD;
      total of 5 days: 3 days prior and two days after and including the coiling procedure day) is&#xD;
      superior placebo in preventing clinical and silent strokes. The primary outcome is a clinical&#xD;
      or silent stroke at the time of discharge assessed by clinical examination and MRI brain.&#xD;
