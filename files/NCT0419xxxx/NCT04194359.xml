  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sintilimab (R&amp;D code: IBI308) is a recombinant human-derived IgG4 type PD-1 monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody. PD-1 inhibitor combined with chemotherapy has synergistic effect to further enhance&#xD;
      anti-tumor immunity. This study is a phase III clinical study of a three-week regimen of&#xD;
      sintilimab combined with the XELOX+ bevacizumab for RAS-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer&#xD;
      patients who had not received any treatment before. The purpose of this study is to explore&#xD;
      the efficacy of sintilimab combined with XELOX + bevacizumab as first line therapy.&#xD;
