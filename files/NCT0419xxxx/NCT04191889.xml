    <textblock>
      This study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of hepatic arterial infusion&#xD;
      chemotherapy combined with Apatinib and Camrelizumab (Triplet-combined Therapy) for C-staged&#xD;
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma in BCLC classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is to evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) of&#xD;
      Triplet-combined Therapy for C-staged Hepatocellular Carcinoma in BCLC classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary Outcome measures include the duration of response (DOR), disease control rate&#xD;
      (DCR), progression-free survival rate (PFSR) [ Time Frame: 6- and 12-month], overall survival&#xD;
      rate (OSR) [ Time Frame: 6- and 12-month], the median progression-free survival time (mPFS)&#xD;
      and median overall survival time (mOS) of Triplet-combined Therapy for C-staged&#xD;
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma in BCLC classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, this study aims to assess the safety and tolerability of Triplet-combined Therapy&#xD;
      for C-staged Hepatocellular Carcinoma in BCLC classification.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary liver cancer is a common malignant tumor of the digestive system in the world. There&#xD;
      are about 854,000 new incidences and 810,000 mortality each year. In China, there is a high&#xD;
      incidence of liver cancer, with about 466,000 new cases and 422,000 mortality each year.&#xD;
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounted for about 90% of primary liver cancer in&#xD;
      pathological type. Most patients have reached advanced stage or with distant metastasis when&#xD;
      diagnosed and the natural median survival time is only 3 to 4 months. Then only systemic&#xD;
      therapy is recommended for patients in advanced HCC in many global guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) of mFOLFOX7, anti-angiogenic targeting drugs,&#xD;
      and antibody immunotherapy against programmed death molecule-1 (PD-1) immunological&#xD;
      checkpoints are effective treatment options for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Many&#xD;
      clinical studies have shown that the two-two combination of the above three treatment options&#xD;
      can improve the anti-tumor overall response rate, the survival rate and even achieve clinical&#xD;
      complete remission of patients with advanced HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shi Ming et al reported HAIC combined with systemic targeted therapy has a better survival&#xD;
      outcome compared to systemic targeted therapy mono-therapy [OS 13.37 vs 7.13 months, PFS 7.03&#xD;
      vs 2.6 months] in JAMA Oncology. Although the toxicity of combination therapy is slightly&#xD;
      higher than that of sorafenib monotherapy, these adverse effects are tolerable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, in a phase Ib study of Camrelizumab combined with apatinib in the treatment of&#xD;
      advanced liver cancer, gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction cancer showed that in 16&#xD;
      patients with HCC, the ORR was 50.0% and the DCR was 93.8%. When the dose of apatinib was 250&#xD;
      mg, the median PFS was 7.2 months. Camrelizumab combined with low dose apatinib can&#xD;
      effectively reduce the incidence of adverse reactions, ≥10% of patients have&#xD;
      treatment-related adverse reactions (all levels), no treatment-related adverse reactions&#xD;
      leading to death. Therefore, low-dose anti-angiogenic drugs can inhibit tumor angiogenesis on&#xD;
      the one hand, reduce immunosuppression by inducing normalization of blood vessels, enhance&#xD;
      effector immune cell infiltration, and enhance anti-tumor immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, for patients of C-staged Hepatocellular Carcinoma, HAIC, anti-angiogenic targeted&#xD;
      therapy, and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy have their important status, and the combination of any&#xD;
      two treatments brings about synergy effect. Then, could the combination of the three&#xD;
      treatment methods further improve the outcome of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma? This&#xD;
      study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a combination of hepatic arterial&#xD;
      infusion chemotherapy, targeted drugs (Apatinib), and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy (Camrelizumab)&#xD;
      to provide a more effective and toxic-tolerable treatment for patients in C-staged&#xD;
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma in BCLC classification.&#xD;
