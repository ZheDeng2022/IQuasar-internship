  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Various regimens were used for prevention of hypotension; most of these regimens included the&#xD;
      use of vasopressors. Ephedrine is commonly used vasopressor for management and prophylaxis of&#xD;
      hypotension; however, ephedrine is usually associated with tachycardia which increases oxygen&#xD;
      consumption; thus, it might be potentially harmful in this special group of patients.&#xD;
      Phenylephrine (PE) is another vasopressor which is characterized by α agonistic activity. PE&#xD;
      had been the preferred vasopressor for prophylaxis against post-spinal hypotension especially&#xD;
      in obstetric population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      it was reported that PE improved the intraoperative hemodynamic profile in elderly patients&#xD;
      undergoing lower extremities orthopedic surgery under spinal anesthesia. PE (a pure α&#xD;
      agonist) was reported to decrease cardiac output which limit its use in patients with&#xD;
      compromised cardiac contractility; this fact makes the use of PE in elderly patients&#xD;
      questionable. Norepinephrine (NE) is characterized by α agonistic and weak β agonistic&#xD;
      activity; thus, NE is characterized by less cardiac depression compared to PE. NE was&#xD;
      recently introduced for prophylaxis against post-spinal hypotension in obstetric anesthesia.&#xD;
      In non-obstetric population, although, NE infusion effectively maintained patients&#xD;
      hemodynamics during general anesthesia, its use during spinal anesthesia was not adequately&#xD;
      evaluated in elderly population&#xD;

      Preoperative fasting instructions are 6 hours for solid food, and clear fluid will be allowed&#xD;
      up to 2 hours preoperative. Upon arrival to the operating room, routine monitors (ECG, pulse&#xD;
      oximetry, and non-invasive blood pressure monitor) will be applied; intravenous line will be&#xD;
      secured, and routine pre-medications (ranitidine 50 mg and midazolam 0.02 mg/kg slow IV) will&#xD;
      be administrated. Baseline preoperative blood pressure will be recorded in the supine&#xD;
      position as average of 3 reading with difference less than 5 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluid management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before initiation of spinal anesthesia for all study patients, Electrical cardiometry device&#xD;
      (ICON; Cardiotonic, Osypka; Berlin, Germany) will be applied to the patient through 4&#xD;
      electrodes at the following sites: Below the left ear, Above the midpoint of the left&#xD;
      clavicle, Left mid-axillary line at level of the xiphoid process and 5 cm inferior to the&#xD;
      third electrode. Stroke volume variability (SVV) will be measured while patient maintaining&#xD;
      standard calm breathing at a rate of 6-8 breath/minute before the intrathecal injection. The&#xD;
      patient with SVV more than 13% with be considered fluid responder 16 and will receive fluid&#xD;
      bolus of 5 ml/kg ringer acetate over 10 minutes. The fluid bolus will be repeated till SVV&#xD;
      less than 13%, then spinal anesthesia will be performed. After induction of spinal anesthesia&#xD;
      maintenance fluid as 2ml/kg/hour of ringer acetate will be commenced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinal anesthesia will be performed in the sitting position at level of second and third or&#xD;
      third and forth lumber interspaces with a 25-gauge spinal needle. After confirming&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid flow, 10 mg of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine plus 25 mcg fentanyl will be&#xD;
      injected. The degree of sensory block (cold test by alcohol gauze) will be assessed in the&#xD;
      study with a goal of T6-8 dermatomal level block. If spinal anesthesia failed, the patient&#xD;
      will be excluded from the study and will be managed according to the attending anesthetist&#xD;
      discretion, local expertise and clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vasopressor management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vasopressor infusion will be started after obtaining CSF through the same line with IV fluids&#xD;
      aided by a three-way stop-cock after induction of spinal anesthesia, patients will receive&#xD;
      the vasopressor infusion according to the previous randomization Any episode of spinal&#xD;
      induced hypotension (defined as mean arterial pressure &lt; 80% of the baseline reading 30&#xD;
      minutes after spinal block) will be managed by 5 mcg norepinephrine and the infusion rate&#xD;
      will be increased by 20%. If the hypotensive episode persisted for 2 minutes, another bolus&#xD;
      of norepinephrine will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If bradycardia (defined as heart rate less than 50 bpm) with hypotension occurred, it will be&#xD;
      manged with 0.5 mg of atropine IV. If bradycardia occurred with hypertension (MAP increase&#xD;
      25% over the baseline), the vasopressor infusion will be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If hypertension occurred (defined as increased mean arterial pressure by &gt; 25% of the&#xD;
      baseline reading), vasopressor infusion will be decreased by 50%. If hypertension persisted 2&#xD;
      minutes after reduction of the infusion, the vasopressor infusion will be stopped. The&#xD;
      vasopressor will be returned to 50% of the starting dose if there was further decline in&#xD;
      blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The infusion will continue for 45 minutes after spinal anesthesia. If the patient developed&#xD;
      hypotension after stoppage of the infusion, management will depend on the fluid status of the&#xD;
      patient. If the cause of hypotension was blood loss, replacement will be done (3:1 of ringer&#xD;
      acetate till transfusion threshold met then packed RBC is given with target haemoglobin&#xD;
      ≥9gm/dl). If the hypotension was not related to blood loss, vasopressor will be re-initiated&#xD;
      at the last dose before stoppage&#xD;
