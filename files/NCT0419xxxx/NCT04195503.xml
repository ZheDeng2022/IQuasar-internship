  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diagnosis of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) is an increasingly common form of primary&#xD;
      liver cancer, but patients with this diagnosis are not currently eligible for LT. This study&#xD;
      proposes to offer LT as an option to patients with advanced, unresectable iCCA who&#xD;
      demonstrate at least 6 months of disease stability /regression while receiving standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Patients will be referred and screened for study participation if they have&#xD;
      achieved 6 months of disease stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be worked up for transplant and if eligible, will be listed. Disease must remain&#xD;
      controlled while awaiting transplantation. After transplantation, patients will be followed&#xD;
      for disease recurrence and overall survival, while receiving standard post-transplantation&#xD;
      followup.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients treated with standard of care chemotherapy for unresectable, biopsy-proven&#xD;
      intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and who demonstrate stability/regression of disease for a&#xD;
      minimum of 6 months, may be eligible for study. Following informed consent and screening,&#xD;
      eligible patients with a potential live liver donor (an interested, ABO-compatible&#xD;
      individual, without obvious contraindications for donation) will be evaluated for&#xD;
      transplantation. During this period, patients will continue to receive chemotherapy and&#xD;
      imaging at the usual intervals. Once a patient completes the pre-transplant assessments and&#xD;
      is deemed &quot;suitable for transplantation&quot; , the living donor's assessments may begin. If the&#xD;
      donor is found suitable, a tentative date will be set for the surgeries. Systemic&#xD;
      chemotherapy will be stopped approximately 4 weeks before the surgery date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At that point, the potential recipient will be reimaged (CT scan). Test results, and&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed to ensure the participant remains eligible&#xD;
      to proceed to transplant. If these scans reveal any suspicion of tumor infiltration to&#xD;
      surrounding tissues, an exploratory laparotomy or endoscopic ultrasound procedure will be&#xD;
      scheduled to allow for visual examination and sampling of those tissues. Tissue samples, such&#xD;
      as perihilar fat and/or lymph nodes, will be sent to the pathology department for urgent&#xD;
      review. If extrahepatic disease is identified, the participant will be excluded from the&#xD;
      study and the transplant will not be performed. Any excluded participants will continue to be&#xD;
      followed for the study as &quot;drop outs&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Otherwise, the donor and recipient surgeries will be performed in the standard fashion and&#xD;
      with the preferred technique of the surgeon. The patient and donor will receive standard of&#xD;
      care post-operative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants (recipients) will be monitored closely for evidence of tumor recurrence with&#xD;
      imaging and blood tests. Results of these tests will be collected until completion of the&#xD;
      study follow-up period (5-years after LT). In addition to tumor surveillance, liver&#xD;
      transplant status will be assessed at each study timepoint (including graft loss, rejection,&#xD;
      liver function tests, and details of immunosuppression). The study will also collect details&#xD;
      of any biopsies performed, re-hospitalizations and surgical complications&#xD;
