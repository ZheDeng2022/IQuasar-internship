  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluated the feasibility of a remote web-based ecological cognitive training&#xD;
      protocol to healthy older adults. The training protocol involves 5 training sessions.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous research demonstrated the relevance in training cognitive abilities that typically&#xD;
      decline with age, such as those associated with executive control (e.g., abstract thinking,&#xD;
      selective and divided attention, planning, task-switching and inhibitory control). The aim of&#xD;
      the present study is to investigate the feasibility of a web-based cognitive training focused&#xD;
      on executive control to cognitively healthy older adults. The participants will undergo the&#xD;
      web-training in a daily type situation of meal preparation (i.e., Breakfast Game). The&#xD;
      training protocol combines the tasks of table setting and cooking in a multi-tasking fashion.&#xD;
      In some sessions Emphasis Change approach will be apply to the training, in order to assess&#xD;
      it feasibility and potential effects in optimizing the performance. In addition, participants&#xD;
      will undergo a brief web-based cognitive evaluation before and after training. If feasible,&#xD;
      the investigators protocol will allow training older adults in critical cognitive skills for&#xD;
      daily life situations. The web-based training is an advancement since it can be delivered&#xD;
      at-home, remotely supervised, and is easily scalable. Recently, remote interventions have&#xD;
      been particularly relevant to older adults due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which may limit&#xD;
      in-person research participation.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in cooking time (milliseconds) in each food type. In the computerized task, participants are asked to cook different food types. Scores reflect the average absolute values of the difference between the required and actual cooking time of each item. Lowers scores (closest to zero) represent a better outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in cooking time (milliseconds) between food items. In the computerized task, participants are asked to cook different food types. Scores reflect is the difference between the first and last food item stopped cooking. Lowers scores (closest to zero) represent a better outcome.</description>
