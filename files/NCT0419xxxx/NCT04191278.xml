  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking remains highly prevalent among persons living with HIV (PLWH). Quitting&#xD;
      smoking can have important health benefits for this population. However, PLWH have&#xD;
      historically had a difficult time quitting smoking. This is likely due, at least in part, to&#xD;
      poor medication adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Poor adherence to medication is a well-documented issue among PLWH. Research shows that not&#xD;
      taking smoking cessation medications as prescribed can limit their treatment effectiveness.&#xD;
      Improving adherence to smoking cessation medications will likely increase smoking cessation&#xD;
      attempt success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mobile phone applications and behavioral interventions show promise for improving adherence&#xD;
      to smoking cessation medications and cessation outcomes among PLWH. Therefore, this trial&#xD;
      will assess 1) whether a mobile phone application is a feasible and acceptable intervention&#xD;
      for improving medication adherence; 2) whether use of the mobile phone app improves adherence&#xD;
      to varenicline; and 3) smoking cessation outcomes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking is a significant public health problem among persons living with HIV&#xD;
      (PLWH). The prevalence of smoking among PLWH is 40-75%, compared to approximately 15% in the&#xD;
      general population. In PLWH, smoking confers increased risk of cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      respiratory conditions, lung cancer, poor adherence to antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, poor HIV&#xD;
      treatment outcomes, and all-cause mortality. Approximately 24% of deaths among PWLH on ARV&#xD;
      are attributable to tobacco use. Moreover, smokers with HIV lose more life years to smoking&#xD;
      than to HIV itself (13 versus 5 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smoking cessation is a challenge for smokers with HIV. Smokers with HIV are interested in&#xD;
      quitting, yet most quit attempts end in relapse. Poor cessation outcomes are likely&#xD;
      attributable, in part, to poor adherence to smoking cessation medications. Not taking&#xD;
      varenicline as prescribed significantly limits treatment effectiveness. Adherence to&#xD;
      varenicline in smokers with HIV is poor, with only 56-62% of individuals in clinical trials&#xD;
      taking the medication as prescribed. Putatively, real world adherence is expected to be&#xD;
      lower. Medication adherence is a well-documented issue in HIV: only 62% achieve optimal&#xD;
      adherence to ARV. Interventions are needed to improve smoking cessation medication adherence&#xD;
      among smokers with HIV. Such interventions will improve cessation and reduce the burden of&#xD;
      smoking in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mobile phone-delivered interventions show promise for improving cessation outcomes in smokers&#xD;
      living with HIV. However, an intervention that provided text message medication reminders and&#xD;
      motivational cessation messages with or without phone-delivered counseling, as compared to a&#xD;
      control group, yielded no group differences for varenicline adherence. Thus, it is possible&#xD;
      that more intensive, and multi-component, interventions are required to improve the&#xD;
      effectiveness of mobile-phone-based interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will: 1) assess the feasibility and acceptability of a mobile phone app that aims&#xD;
      to increase medication adherence; 2) whether use of the app and/or contingency management&#xD;
      increases adherence to varenicline over varenicline treatment as usual; and 3) monitor&#xD;
      smoking cessation outcomes.&#xD;
