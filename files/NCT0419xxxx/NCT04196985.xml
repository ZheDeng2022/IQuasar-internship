    <textblock>
      Comparing FDG PET/CT and FDG PET/MRI in the diagnostic accuracy of detecting local recurrence&#xD;
      12 weeks after the end of CRT in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients. Forty&#xD;
      patients aged more than 18 years who have a histologically confirmed HNSCC and have received&#xD;
      chemoradiation therapy will be recruited for the study. The patients will be scanned with&#xD;
      both PET/CT and PET/MRI 12 weeks after the end of CRT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since recurrence of HNSCC occurs in up to 50 percent of cases in the first two years&#xD;
      following treatments and the recurrent diseases are less responsive to new treatments,&#xD;
      detecting local/regional recurrence at an earlier time is crucial in order to provide salvage&#xD;
      treatments. The primary objective of this prospective study is to compare the diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy of FDG PET/CT to FDG PET/MRI in the detection of local recurrence 12 weeks after the&#xD;
      end of chemoradiation treatment in HNSCC patients. The hypothesis is that PET/MRI might be&#xD;
      able to diagnose locoregional recurrence earlier and more accurately which would lead to a&#xD;
      better outcome for the patient. If it is proven correct, it would be possible to optimize the&#xD;
      use of PET/MRI imaging on selected patients who are likely to benefit clearly from the use of&#xD;
      that modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty patients aged more than 18 years who have a histologically confirmed HNSCC and have&#xD;
      received chemoradiation therapy will be recruited for the study. The patients will be scanned&#xD;
      with both FDG-PET/CT and FDG-PET/MRI 12 weeks after the end of CRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study participants will be consented, and the estimated time for completing the PET scans&#xD;
      of 40 patients will take 12 to 15 months. The results will be reported in international&#xD;
      peer-reviewed high-impact journals.&#xD;
