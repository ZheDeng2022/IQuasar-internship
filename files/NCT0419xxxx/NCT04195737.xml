    <textblock>
      The present study is a human, prospective, randomised controlled clinical trial conducted to&#xD;
      explore the outcome of a coronally advanced flap with ossix volumaxTM collagen matrix and&#xD;
      connective tissue graft in the treatment of multiple adjacent gingival recession defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT)&#xD;
      criteria, 2010.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Periodontal plastic surgery are surgical procedures performed to prevent or correct anatomic,&#xD;
      developmental, traumatic or disease-induced defects of the gingiva, alveolar mucosa or bone.&#xD;
      It includes various soft and hard tissue procedures aimed at gingival augmentation, root&#xD;
      coverage, correction of mucosal defects at implants, crown lengthening, gingival preservation&#xD;
      at ectopic tooth eruption, removal of aberrant frena, prevention of ridge collapse associated&#xD;
      with tooth extraction and augmentation of the edentulous ridge.1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different predisposing anatomic features can result in recession such as position and anatomy&#xD;
      of teeth in the dental arch, bony dehiscence, thickness of the alveolar mucosa, muscle pull,&#xD;
      orthodontic treatment, thin gingival biotype, buccal prominence of teeth, lack of keratinized&#xD;
      tissue, abnormal frenum attachment, or patient related factors such as vigorous brushing or&#xD;
      chronic gingival inflammation.2 The migration of the marginal tissue to an apical position&#xD;
      may lead to esthetic concern, dentin hypersensitivity, root caries, and cervical wear.&#xD;
      Treatment modalities for gingival recession have many influencing factors such as defect&#xD;
      dimensions (depth, width), site (maxilla, mandible), defect number (single, multiple), soft&#xD;
      tissue anatomy (keratinized tissue quality/quantity; papilla height/width; frenum/ muscle&#xD;
      pull; vestibular depth) tooth position etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various surgical techniques for the treatment of recessions includes the use of full or&#xD;
      partial thickness flap with various soft tissue grafts such as epithelized free gingival&#xD;
      grafts (FGG) or sub-epithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) in conjunction with various&#xD;
      types of flaps eg: (envelope, coronally or laterally positioned flap, double pedicle flap&#xD;
      (DPF) or tunnelling (TUN) alone or combined with laterally positioned pedicle flaps (LPPF).3&#xD;
      Coronally advanced flap (CAF) with connective tissue graft (CTG) is considered as the gold&#xD;
      standard treatment for gingival recession. Commercially available materials for root coverage&#xD;
      are expanded Poly Tetra Fluoro Ethylene (Gore-Tex), polglactin, Collagen membranes like&#xD;
      biogide, biomend, resolute, alloderm, collatape etc, collagen matrix such as mucograft, human&#xD;
      amniotic membrane, dermagraft, ossix.4&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently in a case report using platelet concentrate carried on collagen sponge (ossix)&#xD;
      showed favourable results.4 Ossix volumax™ has shown De novo bone formation when used in&#xD;
      alveolar ridge augmentation procedure.5&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ossix volumax™ (Datum dental) is one such recently identified sugar cross-linked bio&#xD;
      programmed collagen matrix. Ossix volumax™ is a volumizing, thick collagen scaffold,&#xD;
      featuring glymatrix technology. The properties are thick and expand when wet, excellent&#xD;
      handling, easy to use, adapts and adheres to the bone.5 It undergoes rapid ossification (in&#xD;
      CT scans and histology after one month).6&#xD;
&#xD;
      Literature search till date has shown no studies regarding the use of type 1 sugar&#xD;
      cross-linked collagen membrane for treatment of gingival recession. So, the present study is&#xD;
      undertaken with the aim to comparatively evaluate the advantages of ossix volumax collagen&#xD;
      membrane with subepithelial connective tissue graft for the treatment of multiple adjacent&#xD;
      gingival recession defects.&#xD;
