  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2012, the Kids University for Cooking Foundation BV has developed a nutrition education&#xD;
      programme called 'Kokkerelli Learning Street'. This innovative programme aims to teach&#xD;
      primary school students from study years 5-8 where food comes from, how it is processed, and&#xD;
      how it can be used for the preparation of a healthy meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Kokkerelli Learning Street is offered to primary school children in the region of Venlo,&#xD;
      the Netherlands. The present study will investigate the effects of the Kokkerelli Learning&#xD;
      Street on several determinants of children's fruit and vegetable intake. Based on the&#xD;
      literature and the aims of the Learning Street, five relevant determinants are selected: (i)&#xD;
      knowledge; (ii) taste preferences; (iii) intention; (iv) skills; and (v) attitude.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using child-reported questionnaires, the present study aims to answer the following key&#xD;
      questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      What are the short-term and longer-term effects of the Kokkerelli Learning Street on&#xD;
      children's:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Knowledge regarding fruit and vegetable consumption?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intentions regarding fruit and vegetable consumption?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Attitude regarding fruit and vegetable consumption?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Liking of fruit and vegetables?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skills regarding fruit and vegetable preparation?&#xD;

      In 2012, the Kids University for Cooking Foundation BV has developed a nutrition education&#xD;
      programme called 'Kokkerelli Learning Street'. This innovative programme aims to teach&#xD;
      primary school students aged 8-12 years (study years 5-8) where food comes from, how it is&#xD;
      processed, and how it can be used for the preparation of a healthy meal. The theoretical&#xD;
      foundation of the Learning Street is based on the EnRG framework, which states that behaviour&#xD;
      is influenced both by conscious and unconscious processes. These processes can (in)directly&#xD;
      be influenced by environmental factors. In addition, several behavioural and personal factors&#xD;
      are thought to moderate the causal path.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Kokkerelli Learning Street is offered to primary school children in the region of Venlo,&#xD;
      the Netherlands. It involves education based on concepts of the Self-Determination Theory,&#xD;
      active learning, and imagineering (e.g., self-experience in an interactive environment,&#xD;
      rather than conventional education). The present study will investigate the effects of the&#xD;
      Kokkerelli Learning Street on several determinants of children's fruit and vegetable intake.&#xD;
      Based on the EnRG framework, other literature and the aims of the Learning Street, five&#xD;
      relevant determinants are selected: (i) knowledge; (ii) taste preferences; (iii) intention;&#xD;
      (iv) skills; and (v) attitude.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using child-reported questionnaires, the present study aims to answer the following key&#xD;
      questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      What are the short-term and longer-term effects of the Kokkerelli Learning Street on&#xD;
      children's:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Knowledge regarding fruit and vegetable consumption?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intentions regarding fruit and vegetable consumption?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Attitude regarding fruit and vegetable consumption?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Liking of fruit and vegetables?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skills regarding fruit and vegetable preparation?&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline fruit and vegetable knowledge at 3 months after the evaluation lesson</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months</time_frame>
    <description>Knowledge will be assessed by six knowledge questions in the child questionnaire. A total knowledge score based on the number of correct answers will be calculated. The minimum score that can be obtained is 0, indicating low knowledge. The maximum score that can be obtained is 6, indicating high knowledge.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline intention to consume fruit and vegetables at three months after the evaluation lesson</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months</time_frame>
    <description>Questions assessing intention will concern participants' plans to consume or cook a meal containing the specific food product in the future and will be assessed on a scale from 1='I don't know' to 6='yes I will'. A mean score will be calculated to assess intention. The minimum score that can be obtained is 0, indicating low intention. The maximum score that can be obtained is 6, indicating high intention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline attitude towards fruit and vegetable (consumption) at 3 months after the evaluation lesson</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months</time_frame>
    <description>Questions and scales for attitude ('How much do you think the target behaviours are clever/interesting and nice/cool/tasty?') will be used as described by Ajzen and Fishbein and as previously used in comparable research. They will have response options ranging from 1='no, not at all' to 5='yes, totally'. A mean score will be calculated to assess attitude.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline taste preferences for fruit and vegetables at 3 months after the evaluation lesson</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months</time_frame>
    <description>Three questions will be used for taste preferences (e.g., 'What do you think about the taste of the food product?') (scale from 1='never tried' to 6='I like it very much'). A mean score will be calculated to assess taste preferences.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline skills regarding fruit and vegetable consumption at 3 months after the evaluation lesson</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months</time_frame>
    <description>For skills, children will be asked if they are able to cook a meal with the specific food product ('I don't know', 'no', 'a little', 'yes').</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline fruit and vegetable intake at 3 months after the evaluation lesson</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months</time_frame>
    <description>One question is included in the child-reported questionnaire on which children can indicate how often they eat the specific food product (range from 1='never' to 6='very often (more than once a week').</description>

    <description>The Kokkerelli Learning Street focusses on one specific food product (kale, tomato, asparagus, pepper, strawberry, blue berry, mushroom, carrot, or leek) and consists of multiple components:&#xD;
An introduction lesson at school. Children are introduced to the product and familiarised with growing and harvesting processes and the importance of the product regarding health.&#xD;
A visit to a grower's farm during which children are introduced to the precise planting, growing and harvesting procedures of the product. Children are allowed to enter the facilities (e.g., the greenhouse) and observe and experience the farming of the product.&#xD;
A cooking workshop at the facilities of Kids University for Cooking BV. Children prepare a meal with help of volunteers. After preparing the meal, children help to set the table and consume their self-prepared meal.&#xD;
An evaluation lesson at school. Children evaluate the Learning Street together with their peers and teacher.</description>
