  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study LBx-1001 is a multi-center randomized, double-blind study to assess the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of LBP-EC01 in patients with&#xD;
      indwelling urinary catheters, or requiring intermittent catheterization, and/or patients with&#xD;
      asymptomatic bacteriuria caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli). This study population has been&#xD;
      selected because LBP-EC01 is a phage cocktail where active bacterial host engagement is&#xD;
      required to allow for amplification of the phage and evaluation of the safety and PK of the&#xD;
      phage cocktail. Eligible patients will require confirmation of colonization with a urine&#xD;
      sample taken within 10 days of randomization that cultures contain ≥10^3 E. coli CFU/mL,&#xD;
      without the patient having clinical signs or symptoms of an active urinary tract infection&#xD;
      (UTI) requiring antibiotic treatment. Patients should have E. coli as the primary colonizing&#xD;
      bacteria and must not have a secondary bacterial colonization at levels equal to or greater&#xD;
      than that seen from E. coli.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 30 patients 18 years of age or older with a history of urinary tract infection&#xD;
      or colonization caused by E. coli who have indwelling urinary catheters, or who require&#xD;
      intermittent catheterization, and/or patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria caused by E. coli&#xD;
      colonization (≥10^3 CFU/mL) on microbiological diagnosis, without clinical signs or symptoms&#xD;
      of infection requiring antibiotic treatment will be enrolled. Patients will be screened for&#xD;
      presence of E. coli colonization (≥10^3 CFU/mL) prior to randomization and evaluated for&#xD;
      potential bacterial susceptibility to LBP-EC01.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: To evaluate the pharmacodynamics (PD) of LBP-EC01. Exploratory&#xD;
      Objective: To explore the influence of LBP-EC01 on the urinary tract microbiota.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Provision of signed and dated informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the&#xD;
             duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Males or females 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with a lower urinary tract colonization caused by E. coli (≥10^3 CFU/mL) and&#xD;
             who meet at least one of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has an indwelling urinary catheter and medical documentation of a urinary tract&#xD;
                  infection by E. coli within the past 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Requires intermittent catheterization and medical documentation of a urinary&#xD;

                  urinary tract colonization) with E. coli at least once in the past 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must have experience with urinary catheterization or have Medical Monitor&#xD;
             approval if the patient does not have prior experience with catheterization.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with clinical signs of active UTI or other infection requiring antimicrobial&#xD;
             treatment. These may include dysuria, urinary frequency, urinary urgency, suprapubic&#xD;
             discomfort and flank pain in addition to non-specific symptoms of urinary leakage,&#xD;
             change in voiding habits, worsening muscle spasm, increasing autonomic dysreflexia,&#xD;
             sweating, malaise, and fever or hypothermia. Analgesic use is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who have received Gram-negative bacteria antimicrobials within 14 days of&#xD;
             randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Patients who are currently only receiving antibiotics with only Gram-positive&#xD;
             activity (e.g., vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid) to treat active infections against&#xD;
             Gram-positive non-UTIs can be included in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Presence of a surgically-modified bladder, except for a repaired ruptured bladder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of severe autonomic dysreflexia, which is defined as those patients who have a&#xD;
             spinal cord injury and who have had a documented sudden increase in systolic blood&#xD;
             pressure of greater than 40 mm Hg due to an irritation or stimulation (including&#xD;
             bladder or bowel irritation) below the level of the spinal cord injury. Autonomic&#xD;
             dysreflexia can include findings of hypertensive crisis or emergency, clinically&#xD;
             significant bradycardia/tachycardia, severe headache or other severe reaction&#xD;
             requiring an acute intervention, so consultation with the Medical Monitor should take&#xD;
             place if a history of severe autonomic dysreflexia is suspected but not clearly&#xD;
             identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Active severe, progressive or uncontrolled renal, hepatic, hematologic,&#xD;
             gastrointestinal, endocrine, pulmonary, cardiac, or neurologic disease per the&#xD;
