    <textblock>
      Recently, Maziak established a clinical lab at FIU to test the potential of waterpipe tobacco&#xD;
      flavor regulation by the FDA. Given the importance of flavors on adolescent ENDS uptake and&#xD;
      use, this lab is equipped to study the impact of flavor manipulations among adolescent ENDS&#xD;
      users. In this study will recruit 80 young (18-24) JUUL users, in a 2x2 cross over lab study&#xD;
      where in one condition they will use their JUUL preferred flavor and the other JUUL standard&#xD;
      tobacco flavor. Our aims are to; Aim 1: Compare satisfaction, withdrawal suppression, and&#xD;
      harm perception between tobacco-flavored and preferred flavor JUUL. This analysis will reveal&#xD;
      the extent to which preferred flavor contributes to smoking satisfaction, withdrawal and&#xD;
      craving suppression, and harm perception, compared to the standard tobacco flavor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Compare puff topography and plasma nicotine levels between tobacco-flavored and&#xD;
      preferred flavor JUUL. This analysis will examine the extent to which preferred flavor&#xD;
      contributes to puffing behavior and toxicant exposure compared to the standard tobacco&#xD;
      flavor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Compare exhaled breath condensate (EBC) between tobacco-flavored and preferred flavor&#xD;
      JUUL. This analysis will be the first to examine exposure to toxic aldehydes (formaldehyde,&#xD;
      acetaldehyde, acrolein, benzaldehyde, and propionaldehyde) produced when using preferred&#xD;
      flavor compared to the standard tobacco flavor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Utilizing powerful clinical lab methods, this study will provide a broad testing of the&#xD;
      effect of flavor manipulation on college-aged JUUL users, and provide experimental evidence&#xD;
      about the potential of flavor-limitation policies on young ENDS users in the US.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of e-cigarettes, or electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), among adolescents&#xD;
      and young adults continues to be a major public health issue. Because of appealing design,&#xD;
      flavor selection, and popularity on social media, JUUL ENDS have gained popularity among&#xD;
      young people, many of whom are not aware that JUUL devices contain nicotine. Regulating ENDS&#xD;
      flavor represents a promising approach to curb ENDS use among US youth. This project will&#xD;
      provide a broad testing of the effect of flavor manipulation on college-aged JUUL users, and&#xD;
      assist public health authorities by providing answers to specific questions pertinent to the&#xD;
      potential of ENDS regulation through flavor. These include: - How would flavor manipulation&#xD;
      influence puffing behavior and plasma nicotine levels among JUUL smokers; - how would smoking&#xD;
      smoking preferred or tobacco flavor reflects on smoker's satisfaction, withdrawal&#xD;
      suppression, and harm perception; - how would flavor manipulation affect toxicant exposure&#xD;
      levels measured on exhaled breath condensate (EBC) on JUUL smokers. Answers to these&#xD;
      questions will help public health authorities predict the impact of flavor regulation on ENDS&#xD;
      experimentation and continued use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, Maziak established a clinical lab at FIU to test the potential of waterpipe tobacco&#xD;
      flavor regulation by the FDA. Given the importance of flavors on adolescent ENDS uptake and&#xD;
      use, this lab is equipped to study the impact of flavor manipulations among adolescent ENDS&#xD;
      users. In this study, we will recruit 80 young (18-24) JUUL users. Each participant will&#xD;
      undergo 3 JUUL smoking sessions: 1) one where they will be vaping their preferred flavor; 2)&#xD;
      one where they will be vaping the standard classic tobacco flavor; 3) a third one in which&#xD;
      they will be vaping their preferred flavor in a JUUL Ecigarette (JEC) device that has a&#xD;
      health warning label (HWL) attached to it. In addition, 10 participants will be invited to&#xD;
      come back for two additional sessions: one in which they will be vaping their preferred&#xD;
      flavor pod with a 3% nicotine concentration, and one in which they will use their preferred&#xD;
      flavor pod with 0% nicotine concentration. Measurement of JUUL satisfaction, dependence, harm&#xD;
      perception, and exposure to nicotine and toxicants will be conducted in all 5 sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past few months, there has been an increasing number of reports of severe respiratory&#xD;
      illness related to e-cigarette use. Both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S.&#xD;
      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are currently investigating this outbreak.&#xD;
      According to the CDC, these cases of e-cigarette, or vaping, associated lung injury (EVALI)&#xD;
      have been reported in most patients that report a history of using THC-containing products,&#xD;
      particularly those obtained off the street or from other informal sources (e.g. friends,&#xD;
      family members, illicit dealers)&#xD;
      (https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/severe-lung-disease.html).&#xD;
      Several steps have been taken to minimize this risk (i.e., excluding marijuana and&#xD;
      non-commercial vaping products users; excluding individuals with current potential EVALI&#xD;
      symptoms; revision of the consent &amp; re-consenting of participants that still need to complete&#xD;
      study sessions; and providing all participants with a CDC fact sheet about EVALI). For&#xD;
      further details please refer to the &quot;Methods&quot; &amp; &quot;Minimizing Risks&quot; sections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves minimal risks (explained in more details below in section 8) to&#xD;
      participants. These risks are: 1) JUUL use 2) Dependence 3) Venipuncture 4) EVALI risk. The&#xD;
      risk involved in participating in the JUUL smoking sessions of this study will not exceed the&#xD;
      risk that would otherwise be encountered during similar recreational sessions of JUUL&#xD;
      smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will benefit by being involved in a study that can increase their awareness&#xD;
      about the health and addictive consequences of JUUL smoking and they will be given&#xD;
      educational materials at the end of the study that explain the health impact of e-cigarettes,&#xD;
      the current EVALI outbreak, and include resources that are available to help with quitting&#xD;
      such as national, state and local cessation services (please see the fact sheets attached in&#xD;
      the methods section). The findings of this study will benefit the society at large.&#xD;
      Understanding the effect of flavor manipulation on JUUL/ENDS users will be instrumental for&#xD;
      local and federal health agencies' potential to curb the spread of ENDS use, and protect&#xD;
      public health in the US.&#xD;
