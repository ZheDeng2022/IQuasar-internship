  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to develop a method to improve thinking difficulties in&#xD;
      individuals who have experienced a traumatic brain injury and report experiencing&#xD;
      difficulties in attention and concentration. This study aims to understand how cognitive&#xD;
      rehabilitation of attention difficulties affects brain activity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the effectiveness of two different types of cognitive rehabilitation&#xD;
      in moderate-to-severe (m/s) traumatic brain injury (TBI) survivors. More specifically&#xD;
      comparisons will be made between Direct Attention Training administered via BrainHQ, and&#xD;
      Metacognitive Strategy Training in the form of the evidence-based Goal Management Training&#xD;
      (GMT) protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These interventions will be compared to the standard of care, to each other, and their&#xD;
      combined effectiveness will be assessed. Groups will consist of randomized individuals with&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe TBIs who experience attention deficits. Each treatment will be&#xD;
      administered for 4 weeks and two intervention groups will be used to counterbalance treatment&#xD;
      order. Group 1 will receive BrainHQ first followed by GMT, while Group 2 will receive GMT&#xD;
      first followed by BrainHQ. In addition a third group will serve as a treatment-as-usual&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes include measures of self-care, ability, adjustment and participation.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include measures of cognition and brain function. And lastly, tertiary&#xD;
      outcomes include measures of emotional and psychosocial functioning. These outcomes will be&#xD;
      measures at baseline, following completion of the first 4 week treatment in both groups&#xD;
      (Group 1 = BrainHQ while Group 2 = GMT), and following completion of the second 4 week&#xD;
      treatment in both groups (Group 1 = GMT while Group 2 = BrainHQ).&#xD;

    <description>A composite self-report questionnaire known as the Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory will be used to measure functioning across these domains. This measures uses a scale from 0 to 4. The higher the score the more severe the impairment.</description>

    <description>BrainHQ is a web-based &quot;brain-training&quot; program. The investigators will assign participants to attention specific modules that they will complete at home with the goal of &quot;restoring&quot; attentional functions lost through injury via repetitive tasks of graded difficulty.</description>
