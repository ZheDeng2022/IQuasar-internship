    <textblock>
      This clinical trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a family intervention to reduce&#xD;
      obesity in children. Overweight and obesity, as defined by the World Organization of Health&#xD;
      (WHO) as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that can be harmful to health, they are&#xD;
      considered by this body as one of the most important public health problems of the century&#xD;
      XXI, which is the fifth leading death risk factor in the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OI has been associated with high co-morbidity in adulthood. The percentile increase in body&#xD;
      mass index (BMI) in OI increases the incidence of cases of hypertension , dyslipidemia, left&#xD;
      ventricular hypertrophy, atherosclerosis, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, sleep&#xD;
      disorders, as well as psychological effects, such as stigmatization, discrimination,&#xD;
      depression and emotional trauma. Obesity in childhood also substantially increases the risk&#xD;
      of being an obese adult. In addition, childhood obesity is an independent risk factor for&#xD;
      obesity in adulthood. Criteria favorable to therapeutic intervention in cases of obesity are&#xD;
      based on the demonstration that with a moderate weight loss (5-10%) can achieve a marked&#xD;
      improvement in the associated comorbidity and quality of life even in severe obesity. The&#xD;
      prevalence of multiple risk factors increases as the BMI percentile increases, and severe&#xD;
      obesity is associated with an increased risk of comorbidity and resistance to sustained&#xD;
      weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The discussion about the relevance and form of the approach to childhood obesity is an open&#xD;
      and current issue. A 2007 Cochrane review established that there may be a benefit to&#xD;
      behavioral treatment where parents are given responsibility for behavioral change and this is&#xD;
      done as a family. To start the intervention, professionals with specific training in physical&#xD;
      activity and nutrition applied in childhood, behavioral intervention techniques and promotion&#xD;
      of healthy habits in working with families are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another more recent review focused on evaluating the effectiveness of different interventions&#xD;
      to treat childhood obesity concludes that although there is not much quality data to&#xD;
      recommend a treatment program superior to another, the combined lifestyle and behavior&#xD;
      interventions in Comparison with standard care or self-help can lead to a significant&#xD;
      reduction in overweight in children and adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another aspect to take into account is the relevance of the early intervention of obesity&#xD;
      during childhood-adolescence, since it is at this stage that the eating habits and practice&#xD;
      of physical exercise are consolidated, in addition to where they conform the personality&#xD;
      characteristics of the individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The family intervention is proposed as one of the areas most likely to be successful in&#xD;
      treating childhood obesity. There are several clinical trials that evaluate different&#xD;
      interventions aimed primarily at families and show that they have beneficial effects in the&#xD;
      promotion of healthy behaviors related to food and exercise in boys and girls, in addition to&#xD;
      highlighting the importance of a combined dietary, behavioral and physical activity&#xD;
      component.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The few studies carried out in the specific field of community nursing have small sample&#xD;
      sizes and have not shown that the intervention in nursing consultation has been effective as&#xD;
      far as weight loss is concerned. Another study comparing the effect of medical counseling and&#xD;
      group therapy in childhood obesity concluded that cognitive behavioral therapy is more&#xD;
      effective than medical advice and that none of the two treatment improved results compared to&#xD;
      the untreated group. There are several limitations that could justify this result, among&#xD;
      others the possible insufficient family involvement that is considered of vital importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. 1. CONCEPTUAL Hypothesis : The &quot;Active Families&quot; intervention program is more effective&#xD;
      than the usual practice to reduce the weight of children from 7 to 12 years old with obesity&#xD;
      at the end of the intervention and at 6 and 12 months after the start of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2. OPERATIONAL HYPOTHESIS: The &quot;Active Families&quot; family intervention program decreases an&#xD;
      average of 0.5 standard deviations plus the BMI of children with childhood obesity than the&#xD;
      usual practice at the end of the intervention and at 6 and 12 months after the start of the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. 3.OBJECTIVES Main objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a family intervention&#xD;
      program to reduce weight in children aged 7 to 12 years with childhood obesity compared to&#xD;
      the usual practice at 6 and 12 months after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the effectiveness of a family intervention program aimed at children aged 7 to&#xD;
           12 with childhood obesity to improve the quality of food.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the effectiveness of a family intervention program aimed at children aged 7 to&#xD;
           12 with childhood obesity to increase physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the effectiveness of a family intervention program aimed at children aged 7 to&#xD;
           12 with childhood obesity to increase the physical activity of the main caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design : Controlled clinical trial with randomized allocation by conglomerates, open,&#xD;
      multicenter, 12 months follow-up, in primary care consultations. Location or scope: Health&#xD;
      Centers of the Community of Madrid. Duration: 12 months years. Study population : Children&#xD;
      diagnosed with obesity attended in primary care consultations of 7 to 12 years of both sexes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: It has been estimated for a difference of 0.5 standard deviations ( clinically&#xD;
      relevant result ), and a power of 80%. Specifying a total of 170 children, 85 in each group.&#xD;
      Correcting for a design effect of 1,369, considering an ICC of 0,041 (28) and an average&#xD;
      cluster size of 10 boys or girls, 233 boys or girls are required. Estimating losses of 20%,&#xD;
      the final size is 280 children, 140 in each group. Sampling : Randomized allocation by&#xD;
      conglomerates (nurses). Randomization unit: Primary Health Care Centers. The Health Centers&#xD;
      will be assigned to the intervention or to the control group through a random sequence&#xD;
      generated by computer. Analysis Unit: Diada child / caregiver. They will be included by&#xD;
      consecutive sampling. During the consultation, that child susceptible to being included in&#xD;
      the study will be informed and offered participation. If you agree to participate, you will&#xD;
      be asked to complete and sign the informed consent and verify that you meet all the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. Randomization of health centers will be carried&#xD;
      out once the eligible dyads have been selected for the study, so that the recruitment by&#xD;
      professionals is not influenced by the branch of the study to which they have been assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information will be collected through clinical interview and physical examination and the&#xD;
      data will be recorded in an electronic data collection notebook specially designed for this&#xD;
      study. The variables will be collected during 4 visits: at the beginning of the study, at the&#xD;
      end of the intervention, at 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Losses in participation: Losses and abandonment of follow-up during the study. The cause will&#xD;
      be collected (voluntary abandonment, displacement, comorbidity, death and cause). If a&#xD;
      patient does not attend a session, at least two telephone contact attempts will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group . The activities included in the Service for Childhood Obesity Patients of the&#xD;
      Portfolio of Standardized Primary Care Services of the Community of Madrid will be carried&#xD;
      out , which establishes a monthly follow-up in the first 6 months and bimonthly from 6 to 12.&#xD;
      This consultation will be attended by at least the child and the primary caregiver, the&#xD;
      child's educating agent, and will receive supporting documentation for Exercise and&#xD;
      strengthen your role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Experimental group : Regular intervention plus intervention active families. This&#xD;
      intervention, based on the methodology of meaningful learning , it will have two components:&#xD;
      group education aimed at parents (caregivers) and education aimed at children in the reviews&#xD;
      in consultation. The group intervention will consist of 6 sessions, which with a biweekly /&#xD;
      monthly frequency, will be taught as determined in the program monitoring annex, in the 3&#xD;
      months after the initial assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to normalize and protocolize the activities in both groups (intervention and&#xD;
      control) a training session will be held prior to the start of the field work&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Strategy :&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be done according to the intention to treat principle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Review of the data and descriptive analysis of the study variables evaluating the&#xD;
           normality of the distribution with its corresponding 95% confidence intervals .&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Initial comparability of the groups according to the outcome and confusion variables .&#xD;
           Chi square test for qualitative variables and used the T of Student for quantitative (if&#xD;
           they conform to a normal distribution) or nonparametric test (if not follow a normal&#xD;
           distribution).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Principal effectiveness analysis: calculation of the difference in means of the Z Score&#xD;
           between groups, together with their 95% Confidence Interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess the effect of the intervention on the Z score of the BMI, a multivariate&#xD;
           analysis will be carried out using a mixed multilevel model (level 1: child / caregiver&#xD;
           dyad ; level 2: professional dyad / health center), with the intervention as fixed&#xD;
           effects factor and professionals or centers as random effects factor (Brown H and&#xD;
           Prescott R (1999). Applied mixed models in medicine. New York: Wiley.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This same analysis will be applied to analyze the impact of the intervention on the rest of&#xD;
      the quantitative dependent variables contemplated in the secondary objectives of the study.&#xD;

                and detection of recorded data errors, due to violation of the researcher's manual.&#xD;
                For this, the contracted computer technicians will design specific SQL statements&#xD;
                (Programming language).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Data debugging: validation process by searching for repeated records, and&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Bibliographic update and management of bibliographic references.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - Assistance Group: This group will be formed by nurses and pediatricians of the&#xD;
           participating centers. There will be two people responsible for implementing the program&#xD;
           in each center that will facilitate contact with the coordinating group. Perform the&#xD;
           tasks of the assistance group:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Recruitment of patients and assess the inclusion criteria. Carry out the&#xD;
                intervention assigned to the patients. Collection and registration of data in the&#xD;
                CRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The professionals of the care group will appear as an attached note in the possible&#xD;
                publications derived from the study, so that the names of all the participants&#xD;
                appear in the bibliographic databases. Inclusion in these groups will depend on the&#xD;
                involvement and activities carried out by each collaborator.&#xD;

Complying with the recommendation determines that the child is ACTIVE. Failure to comply with the recommendation classifies the child as inactive. Two questions value if you accumulate 2 hours a day on a regular basis of sedentary leisure (screens). Regularly accumulating more than 2 hours classifies the child as sedentary, not reaching the two hours of daily sedentary leisure classifies the child as unsedentary.&#xD;

    <description>Usual care plus intervention active families. This intervention, based on the methodology of meaningful learning, will have two components: group education directed to parents (caregivers) and education directed to children in the reviews in consultation. The group intervention will consist of 6 sessions, with a biweekly / monthly frequency, will be taught as determined in the program monitoring annex, in the 3 months after the initial assessment. The content of the sessions is defined in attached annex. Regarding the proposed methodology, it has nuances and tools different from the traditional ones to achieve significant learning in the field of health. It is based on participatory methods and a more profound modification of knowledge, skills, emotions and attitudes than the brief advice that is used in family intervention in scheduled consultations.</description>
