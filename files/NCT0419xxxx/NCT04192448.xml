  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the public health and social relevance of sexual aggression and the gap in the extant&#xD;
      literature regarding state anger, emotion regulation, alcohol, and sexual aggression, the&#xD;
      present study will contribute to our understanding of emotion regulation's role in sexual&#xD;
      aggression perpetration. The proposed 2-year research plan will examine the effects of&#xD;
      alcohol intoxication, state anger, and emotion regulation on men's sexual aggression&#xD;
      intentions. This study will recruit non-monogamous, men (individuals who identify their&#xD;
      gender as male and whose biological sex is male) who have sex with women, ages 21-35. While&#xD;
      more research on female perpetrators is needed, the proposed study will exclusively recruit&#xD;
      males for the following reasons: 1) the scientific literature indicating the majority of&#xD;
      sexually aggressive acts are perpetrated by men; and 2) the current sexual aggression analog&#xD;
      has not been piloted with female participants and would require preliminary experiments to&#xD;
      determine its appropriateness. The study will utilize a 2x2 design in which participants are&#xD;
      randomized to beverage condition [alcohol (target BAC= .08gm%) or control (no alcohol&#xD;
      control)] and an emotion induction (anger induction or control). The outcomes will be&#xD;
      assessed using a sexual aggression analog which participants will complete on the descending&#xD;
      limb of alcohol intoxication and indicate the likelihood that they would engage in various&#xD;
      sexually aggressive acts. The study also includes self-report measurements of state anger and&#xD;
      emotion regulation to explore emotion regulation as a moderator in the associations among&#xD;
      alcohol intoxication, state anger, and sexual aggression intentions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Males ages 21 to 35 will be recruited from the community through fliers and advertisements in&#xD;
      bars and local publications (print and electronic) and instructed to call the lab for&#xD;
      telephone screening or complete an online web-screening survey. Sexual aggression is a&#xD;
      pervasive and highly prevalent problem on college campuses, so the project will heavily&#xD;
      advertise at the local college campus. The screening will include an assessment of typical&#xD;
      alcohol consumption patterns, risk for current or past alcohol use disorder, and sexual&#xD;
      risk-taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants (N=180) will be compensated $10 per hour of lab participation for a maximum&#xD;
      payment of $80. Participants will begin by completing a series of background measures (see&#xD;
      Measures) related to alcohol consumption and expectations, sexual aggression perpetration&#xD;
      history, trait anger, and trait emotion regulation. Participants will complete factors of&#xD;
      personality that have demonstrated associations with both emotion regulation and sexual&#xD;
      aggression as covariates, including psychopathy, sensation seeking, and impulsivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive beverages consisting of either an alcohol&#xD;
      dose (target peak BAC =.08gm%) or a control (non-alcoholic) beverage. Participants will be&#xD;
      informed into which alcohol condition they have been assigned. Using a double-blind&#xD;
      procedure, participants will be block randomized by self-reported sexual aggression&#xD;
      perpetration history [(none = no history of perpetration) vs. (low = history of unwanted&#xD;
      sexual contact or sexual coercion) vs. (high = attempted or completed perpetration of&#xD;
      incapacitated or forced rape)]. A computer algorithm will be used to assign participants to&#xD;
      the experimental conditions such that participants with none, low, and high perpetration&#xD;
      history are evenly distributed across beverage conditions. Individuals assigned to the&#xD;
      alcohol condition will consume a beverage comprised of cranberry juice and 100 proof vodka,&#xD;
      while individuals assigned to the control condition will consume a beverage comprised of&#xD;
      cranberry juice and water. The total liquid is divided equally between three cups, and&#xD;
      participant is given nine minutes to consume the total amount (e.g., three minutes per cup).&#xD;
      To ensure stable absorption of alcohol and decrease the likelihood of nausea, the&#xD;
      experimenter will instruct the participant to consume the beverages evenly and to avoid&#xD;
      drinking quickly. Following beverage administration, participants will be Breathalyzed every&#xD;
      five minutes until they attain two Breathalyzer readings of .08%gm to ensure their BAC will&#xD;
      descend during the emotion induction and sexual aggression analog. A yoking procedure will be&#xD;
      employed for control participants in which each control participant is paired with an alcohol&#xD;
      dose participant and receive an equal number of Breathalyzer checks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also be randomly assigned to an emotion induction condition consisting of&#xD;
      either an anger emotion induction or a control emotion induction. This study will employ&#xD;
      deception as individuals will not be told they have been assigned to different emotion&#xD;
      induction conditions. The emotion induction consists of two parts: 1) an emotion recall task;&#xD;
      and 2) provocation task. Individuals assigned to the anger induction will be instructed to&#xD;
      recall an incident in the last 30 days when they felt angry, frustrated, or &quot;pissed off&quot;.&#xD;
      They will then be given five minutes to write as much as possible about that incident and&#xD;
      their response. Participants in the control condition will be instructed to write for five&#xD;
      minutes about a neutral topic (e.g., cooking dinner, going for a walk; Marci et al., 2007).&#xD;
      The writing samples from all participants will be collected and coded by independent coders&#xD;
      to identify whether participants accurately engaged in the task. Following the emotion recall&#xD;
      portion of the induction, participants will begin a provocation task. Both groups will begin&#xD;
      an attention task. Participants assigned to the anger condition will be given negative&#xD;
      feedback about their performance. Participants assigned to the control condition will&#xD;
      complete the task without feedback and then will be thanked for their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of both portions of the emotion induction, participants will read and project&#xD;
      themselves into a written hypothetical sexual situation displayed on a computer. The stimulus&#xD;
      story will be approximately 1,600 words and be written at a 5th grade reading level. The&#xD;
      story will depict a sexual encounter between the participant and a hypothetical female, in&#xD;
      which the female in the story will initially engage in consensual sexual activity however&#xD;
      will gradually display and express resistance to engaging in intercourse. Participants will&#xD;
      then complete assessment of outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after completing the scenario, participants will be required to watch one of&#xD;
      three neutral videos (e.g., comedy clips, nature documentaries) to assist with distancing and&#xD;
      detaching from the content of the story. After completing the videos, sober participants will&#xD;
      be debriefed and paid for their time. Intoxicated participants will be provided with food,&#xD;
      beverages, and entertainment until their BAC descended to below .04%gm. Once their BAC has&#xD;
      descended to below .04%gm, these participants will be debriefed and paid for their time.&#xD;
