  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the LOW-RAO study is to determine the most effective treatment for radial&#xD;
      artery occlusion (RAO) after transradial coronary catheterization (both angiography and PCI).&#xD;
      This is a prospective, single-center, randomized controlled, open-label study that will&#xD;
      randomize patients with RAO into two groups, one receiving anticoagulation with&#xD;
      low-molecular-weight-heparin (LMWH) and the other receiving no anticoagulation. RAO will be&#xD;
      detected by radial artery ultrasound up to 24 hours after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. To evaluate the effect of treatment with LMWH, in patients (both symptomatic and&#xD;
           asymptomatic) with RAO after a coronary catheterization procedure (both angiography and&#xD;
           percutaneous coronary intervention-PCI), in improving patency rates of the radial artery&#xD;
           at 1 month after the procedure, compared with no-LMWH treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. To compare RAO as defined by different methods (pulse palpation, modified Allen's&#xD;
                test, reverse Barbeau test, radial artery ultrasound).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. To compare local access site and systemic complications (bleeding events,&#xD;
                pseudoaneurysm, arteriovenous fistula) at 1 month after the procedure in the LMWH&#xD;
                and no-LMWH groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. To evaluate RAO incidence in coronary angiography and PCI groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. To determine risk factors for RAO in coronary catheterization procedures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of the radial artery as an access site for coronary catheterization procedures, is&#xD;
      constantly increasing because of lower rate of access site complications, shorter hospital&#xD;
      stay, improved patient comfort and safe hemostasis. Radial artery occlusion remains a concern&#xD;
      after transradial procedures, with a varied incidence, ranging from 5 to 38% as reported in&#xD;
      the literature and probably reflecting different evaluation methods (pulse palpation versus&#xD;
      ultrasound).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although perceived as usually asymptomatic, registry data report that RAO may be symptomatic&#xD;
      in up to 58.8% of patients, presenting as pain in the forearm, numbness/ paresthesia, paresis&#xD;
      or acute ischemia. Moreover RAO excludes the affected vessel from future catheterization&#xD;
      procedures, hemodialysis shunts, invasive hemodynamic monitoring, coronary arterial bypass&#xD;
      grafting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spontaneous recanalization of the vessel after RAO ranges from 5.4 to 47% at 1-month follow&#xD;
      up. Today there is no evidence-based therapy, in the frame of a randomized control study, for&#xD;
      the treatment of RAO. Heparinization has been found to be effective in reducing the&#xD;
      occurrence of radial artery occlusion and short-term treatment with low-molecular-weight&#xD;
      heparin (LMWH) in symptomatic patients increases the patency rate of the radial artery after&#xD;
      coronary catheterization procedures, without increasing bleeding complications, as depicted&#xD;
      by registry data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, randomized, multicenter study that will enroll, after informed written&#xD;
      consent, all consecutive patients presenting with RAO, after a coronary catheterization&#xD;
      procedure (both angiography and PCI) through the transradial access and having successfully&#xD;
      received at least one radial artery sheath of any size at the end of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RAO will be diagnosed by radial artery ultrasound (2D, Doppler, colour) performed in all&#xD;
      patients after sheath removal and successful local hemostasis and before hospital discharge.&#xD;
      Clinical evaluation of radial artery patency with pulse palpation, modified Allen's test and&#xD;
      reverse Barbeau test will be also applied in all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients diagnosed with RAO will be randomized 1:1 into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Treatment group, that will receive LMWH (tinzaparin) for 1 month (at&#xD;
           body-weight-adjusted therapeutic dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Control group, that will not receive additional LMWH. All asymptomatic patients, with&#xD;
           patent radial artery at initial work-up, will be provided with the opportunity to return&#xD;
           to the center for further evaluation, clinically and by ultrasound, if they become&#xD;
           symptomatic at any time after hospital discharge, in order to diagnose late RAO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will also be provided with the opportunity to be randomized to LMWH or not in case RAO&#xD;
      is diagnosed and after informed written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients already on anticoagulation for any other reason will neither be excluded nor&#xD;
      randomized, but will be followed-up as the randomized ones, in order to collect data from&#xD;
      this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with RAO will be re-evaluated by radial artery ultrasound at 1-, 2- 4- weeks to&#xD;
      determine radial artery patency and record any bleeding complications according to the EASY&#xD;
      (Early Discharge After Transradial Stenting of Coronary Arteries) Hematoma Classification and&#xD;
      the BARC (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium) bleeding definition.&#xD;
