      This study evaluates thickening fraction alone and together with other ultrasound parameters&#xD;
      of heart and lungs as predictors for extubation outcome&#xD;

      Weaning patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) from the mechanical ventilator is a&#xD;
      critical period and accounts for 40% of the duration of mechanical ventilation itself.&#xD;
      Weaning failure includes failing the initial spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and patients&#xD;
      with extubation failure. Extubation failure is defined as reintubation or need for rescue&#xD;
      non-invasive ventilation within 48 hours following extubation. Patients failing extubation&#xD;
      experience increased time spent on the mechanical ventilator and even increased mortality&#xD;
      rates. Given these risks, predicting readiness for extubation is of key importance in the&#xD;
      ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown, that US is a viable tool for routine use due to its bedside availability&#xD;
      and non-invasiveness, while still maintaining excellent predictive values for its respective&#xD;
      applications. For this reason, over the past years, critical care ultrasonography (US) has&#xD;
      become an important part of routine bedside assessment Lately, the diaphragm has been studied&#xD;
      extensively, due to its strong role in sustaining spontaneous breathing. Especially&#xD;
      predicting extubation outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      has become a great field of interest and different studies have been conducted on this topic.&#xD;
      Currently, indices such as diaphragm thickening (Tdi), diaphragm thickness (Tdi%) and&#xD;
      diaphragm motion are the most frequently used parameters. Of these, thickening fraction seems&#xD;
      to be the most promising to predict successful extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, all of the studies conducted, solely looked at diaphragm function and compared them&#xD;
      to current standards such as the rapid shallow breathing index, while disregarding other&#xD;
      factors strongly correlated to extubation failure, e.g. respiratory and cardiac function, as&#xD;
      proposed by Mayo et al. Taking heart and lung function into account as well seems to be an&#xD;
      interesting approach, because additional measurements could possibly improve predictive value&#xD;
      while putting no further burden on the patient. Furthermore, both heart and lungs can be&#xD;
      assessed quickly and easily by ultrasound. Cardiac parameters that are potentially useful are&#xD;
      left ventricular function, mitral diastolic inflow and cardiac output. Regarding the lungs,&#xD;
      pleural effusion is associated with rate of success for extubation. Effusion is detected&#xD;
      easily and recent studies have shown, that in an ICU setting a simple 8 region protocol is&#xD;
      sufficient to detect extra vascular lung water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesise that a holistic US approach, including measurements of heart,&#xD;
      lungs and diaphragm, will be superior to the core diagnostic parameters of the diaphragm in&#xD;
      predicting extubation success in mechanically ventilated critical care patients.&#xD;
