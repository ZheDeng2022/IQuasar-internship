  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric varices (GV) are present in around 20% of patients with cirrhosis. Bleeding from GV&#xD;
      accounts for 10-20% of all variceal bleeding. For the prevention of gastric variceal&#xD;
      bleeding, TIPS or BRTO as firstline treatments were suggested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No randomized trials have compared BRTO with other therapies. BRTO and its variations might&#xD;
      increase portal pressure and might worsen complications, such as ascites or bleeding from EV.&#xD;
      In this regard, if NSBB is combined with BRTO and its variations (we called interventional&#xD;
      devascularization) for those HVPG responders, the drawbacks of interventional&#xD;
      devascularization might be overcome. Therefore, the investigators conducted this RCT to&#xD;
      compare the effectiveness and safety of TIPS with those of interventional devascularization&#xD;
      in the prevention of rebleeding from gastric varices.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Gastric varices (GV) are present in around 20% of patients with cirrhosis. Bleeding from GV&#xD;
      accounts for 10-20% of all variceal bleeding. GV are classified according to their location&#xD;
      in the stomach and their relationship with esophageal varices (EV). Accordingly, GV are&#xD;
      divided into gastroesophageal varices (GOV) and isolated gastric varices (IGV) . The&#xD;
      management of type 1 GOV, which extend from the esophagus along the lesser curvature of the&#xD;
      stomach, is similar to the management of EV. Historically, bleeding from type 2 GOV (i.e. GOV&#xD;
      extending into the fundus), type 1 IGV (i.e. located in the fundus) and type 2 IGV (i.e.&#xD;
      located anywhere in the stomach), is considered to be more severe and difficult to treat than&#xD;
      EV bleeding. Few studies, mostly retrospective and uncontrolled, have focused on the&#xD;
      management of non-GOV1 GV, and the optimal treatment remains controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the prevention of gastric variceal bleeding, treatment principles can be classified into&#xD;
      two categories: decreasing portal pressure and obstructing GEV. Methods for decreasing portal&#xD;
      pressure include medications (NSBB), radiological intervention (TIPS) and surgery. In&#xD;
      contrast, methods for treating the obstruction of GEV include endoscopic approaches (EVL,&#xD;
      EIS) or radiological intervention (such as BRTO). Recent portal hypertensive bleeding&#xD;
      suggested TIPS or BRTO as firstline treatments in the prevention of rebleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BRTO is a procedure for treatment of fundal varices associated with a large&#xD;
      gastro-/splenorenal collateral. The technique involves retrograde cannulation of the left&#xD;
      renal vein by the jugular or femoral vein, followed by balloon occlusion and slow infusion of&#xD;
      sclerosant to obliterate the gastro-/splenorenal collateral and fundal varices. Several&#xD;
      variations of the technique exist, such as balloon-occluded antegrade transvenous&#xD;
      obliteration or occlusion of the collateral by the placement of a vascular plug or coils.&#xD;
      BRTO has the theoretical advantage over TIPS that it does not divert portal blood inflow from&#xD;
      the liver. On the other hand, BRTO and its variations might increase portal pressure and&#xD;
      might worsen complications, such as ascites or bleeding from EV. In this regard, if NSBB is&#xD;
      combined with BRTO and its variations (we called interventional devascularization) for those&#xD;
      HVPG responders, the drawbacks of interventional devascularization might be overcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators conducted this RCT to compare the effectiveness and safety of&#xD;
      TIPS with those of interventional devascularization in the prevention of rebleeding from&#xD;
      gastric varices.&#xD;
