    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, single-dose study to investigate the plasma PK of&#xD;
      KW-6356 and its major metabolite, after a single oral dose of KW-6356, in subjects with mild&#xD;
      or moderate hepatic impairment and in healthy adults&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potential subjects will be screened to assess their eligibility to enter the study within 4&#xD;
      weeks prior to dose administration. Eligible subjects will be admitted to the clinical&#xD;
      research unit (CRU) before the initiation of investigational medicinal product (IMP)&#xD;
      administration (Check-in/Day -1) and administered of KW-6356 orally on Day 1 after an 8-hour&#xD;
      fast. Those subjects who complete all the scheduled observations/examinations and are&#xD;
      determined to have no clinical abnormalities requiring further hospitalization by the&#xD;
      Investigator, will be discharged from the study site on Day 4. Discharged subjects will then&#xD;
      visit the CRU on the scheduled visit Days 5, 6, 7, 8 for PK sample collections and safety&#xD;
      assessments on Day 12 to complete the End of Study (EOS) visit. The duration of&#xD;
      hospitalization will be 5 days: 4 nights from Day -1 to Day 4.&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Subjects must meet the criteria for mild or moderate hepatic impairment based on CP&#xD;
             classification. Subjects will be classified at Screening based on CP score and&#xD;
             classification will be repeated at Check-in. If the hepatic function classification&#xD;
             for the subject is not the same at the 2 timepoints, enrollment of the subject into a&#xD;
             hepatic category group will be based on the CP score at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects have stable hepatic function with a diagnosis of chronic disease of &gt; 6&#xD;
             months, defined as no clinically significant change in disease status within the 60&#xD;
             days prior to the Screening visit or 90 days prior to drug administration on Day 1&#xD;
             (whichever is longer), as documented by the subject's recent medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects are on a stable medication dose(s) and/or treatment regimen(s) for treatment&#xD;
             of hepatic impairment during the 30 days preceding the first dose of IMP. Drugs known&#xD;
             to be moderate-to-potent inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4/5 enzyme will not be&#xD;
             allowed. Subjects requiring medications that are moderate-to-potent inhibitors or&#xD;
             inducers of CYP3A4/5 may have these medications discontinued for purposes of&#xD;
             qualifying for at least 30 days prior to dosing day for this study. Adjustments may be&#xD;

          9. Subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment may have medical findings consistent&#xD;
             with their hepatic dysfunction, as determined by medical history, physical&#xD;
             examination, 12-lead ECG, vital sign measurements, and clinical laboratory evaluations&#xD;

             (AST, ALT, gamma-glutamyl transferase [γ-GTP], alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin,&#xD;
             albumin [Alb], and PT) at Screening and Check-in. In good health, determined by no&#xD;
             clinically significant findings from medical history, physical examination, 12-lead&#xD;
