  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, single center, open-label, single arm, study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      technical performance of the CLAAS system for closure of the left atrial appendage.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate feasibility of ICE as primary imaging&#xD;
      modality for device success in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation at increased&#xD;
      risk for stroke and systemic embolism who are recommended for oral anticoagulation (OAC)&#xD;
      therapy but have an appropriate rationale to seek a non-pharmacological alternative to OAC.&#xD;
      TEE will be used to confirm the ICE evaluation.&#xD;

          3. High risk of stroke or systemic embolism, defined as a CHA2DS2-VASc score of ≥ 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The patient is recommended for oral anticoagulation therapy (OAC), but has an&#xD;
             appropriate rationale to seek a non-pharmacologic alternative to chronic oral&#xD;
             anticoagulation&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The patient is willing and able to comply with the protocol-specified medication&#xD;
             regimen and follow-up evaluations&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The patient (or legally authorized representative) has been informed of the nature of&#xD;
             the study, agrees to its provisions, and has provided written informed consent&#xD;
             approved by the appropriate Ethics Committee (EC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pregnant or nursing patients and those who plan pregnancy in the period up to 1 year&#xD;
             following the index procedure. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a&#xD;
             negative pregnancy test (per site standard test) within 7 days prior to index&#xD;
             procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Anatomic conditions that would prevent performance of an LAA occlusion procedure&#xD;
             (e.g., prior atrial septal defect [ASD] or patent foramen ovale [PFO], surgical repair&#xD;
             or implanted closure device, or obliterated or ligated left atrial appendage)&#xD;

             reversible (e.g., secondary thyroid disorders, acute alcohol intoxication, trauma,&#xD;
             recent major surgical procedures)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with a medical condition (other than atrial fibrillation) that mandates&#xD;
             chronic oral anticoagulation (e.g., history of unprovoked deep vein thrombosis or&#xD;
             pulmonary embolism, or mechanical heart valve)&#xD;

             mL/min/1.73 m2 (by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation), or dialysis at&#xD;
             the time of screening&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Platelet count &lt;100,000 cells/mm3 or &gt;700,000 cells/mm3, or white blood cell count&#xD;

         16. Patient has a known allergy, hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin,&#xD;
             clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor, or device materials (e.g., nickel, titanium,&#xD;
             gold), or the patient has contrast sensitivity that cannot be adequately pre-medicated&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Current participation in another investigational drug or device study that interferes&#xD;
             with this study&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
