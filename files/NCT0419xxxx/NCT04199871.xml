      Aim 1: To determine whether use of dichoptic movies for 4 weeks may be helpful in improving&#xD;
      control of alignment in children with intermittent exotropia (IXT), thus allowing IXT to be&#xD;
      managed non-surgically Aim 2: To determine pre-IXT surgery use of dichoptic movies for 4&#xD;
      weeks post-operatively may be helpful in maintaining successful control of alignment in&#xD;
      children who have surgical correction of IXT&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most common childhood-onset exotropia is intermittent exotropia (IXT). IXT is an&#xD;
      exotropia that is not constant and is mainly present at distance, but may also be present at&#xD;
      near. Binocular single vision is typically present at near but may be subnormal. There is&#xD;
      some debate in the literature about whether or not these children should be treated&#xD;
      surgically to correct the misalignment. It can be argued that prompt surgical correction is&#xD;
      necessary to prevent the development of suppression of the deviating eye, progression to&#xD;
      constant exotropia, and permanent changes in sensory function that may compromise long-term&#xD;
      post-operative outcomes. On the other hand, statistics on the natural history of IXT suggest&#xD;
      that progression to constant XT occurs in less than 25% and up to 15% may improve&#xD;
      spontaneously. These findings suggest a more conservative approach, using surgery only if&#xD;
      deterioration of the IXT occurs. A recent randomized clinical trial of the two most common&#xD;
      surgical techniques for IXT revealed a 3-year postoperative failure rate of approximately 40%&#xD;
      (PEDIG 2019; Ophthalmology 126: 305-17). For the vast majority of children, surgical failure&#xD;
      was due to recurrence of the exodeviation. Only about 30% of treated children had resolution&#xD;
      of IXT at the 3-year visit. Similarly, a literature review of 28 surgical studies that&#xD;
      included 2530 children with IXT reported a suboptimal surgical outcome at 1-year post-op in&#xD;
      approximately 40% of children. (Coffey et al 1992; Optom Vis Sci 69: 386-404).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Poor surgical results for IXT are thought to occur due to poor sensory status (suppression)&#xD;
      or inadequate motor alignment. There are few data on the effects of non-surgical&#xD;
      interventions designed to improve sensory status of children undergoing surgery for IXT.&#xD;
      Although several retrospective case reviews found evidence supporting a benefit of pre-op&#xD;
      sensory and motor fusion training on IXT surgical outcomes, there have been no prospective&#xD;
      studies or randomized clinical trials. One of the largest retrospective case series (Cooper &amp;&#xD;
      Leyman 1977; Am Orthoptic J 27:61-7) compared 216 patients with IXT who had sensory and motor&#xD;
      fusion training prior to surgery with 264 who had surgery alone and found a higher rate of&#xD;
      good surgical outcomes (52% vs 42%). There are no published data on post-op interventions to&#xD;
      improved sensory status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, engaging movies will be presented on a handheld Nintendo to decrease&#xD;
      suppression and engage stereoacuity. In previous research, use of dichoptic games and movies&#xD;
      by children with amblyopia has been shown to reduce suppression and encourage sensory fusion&#xD;
      (Birch et al 2015, JAAPOS 19:6-11; Birch et al 2019, JAAPOS [Epub ahead of print]; Kelly,&#xD;
      Jost, et al 2016; JAMA Ophthalmol 134:1402-8.; Kelly et al Invest 2018 Ophthalmol Vis Sci&#xD;
      59:1221-8; Li et al 2014; Eye 28: 1246-53). This approach will be adapted by using dichoptic&#xD;
      movies presented on a Nintendo for children with IXT to improve their stereoacuity and reduce&#xD;
      their suppression in an effort improve control of alignment sufficiently without surgery (Aim&#xD;
      1) or to improve stability of post-operative alignment (Aim 2).&#xD;
