    <textblock>
      A short term dyadic psychotherapy intervention for mothers with Post-Partum depression and&#xD;
      their babies in the first year of life was developed. The investigators believe that&#xD;
      following dyadic intervention mothers will show improvement in depressive symptoms, the&#xD;
      quality of the mother-child relationship will improve, and maternal and infant's oxytocin&#xD;
      levels will rise.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects: 60 Mothers will be interviewed and diagnosed as suffering from Post-Partum-&#xD;
      depression (PPD) according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, IV&#xD;
      version (DSM-IV), enrolling within 3-8 months postpartum. Mothers will be recruited through&#xD;
      social media networks. Additional 40 mothers, 3-8 months postpartum will be assessed and&#xD;
      diagnosed as not suffering from PPD or any other psychiatric psychopathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: The baseline assessment will be conducted at the infant's home. A parent-infant&#xD;
      interaction will be videotaped and salivary oxytocin samples will be collected from the&#xD;
      infant and from the mother.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The women in the PPD group will participate in 8 weeks of dyadic psychotherapy (DP) combining&#xD;
      video feedback, or a psycho-educational treatment regarding child development (randomize&#xD;
      selection will be made). During the 8-week treatment, salivary oxytocin samples will be&#xD;
      collected from the infants and from the mother at the beginning and the end of each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another assessment will be conducted at the infant's home, at the end of the treatment. As in&#xD;
      the baseline condition, this assessment will include videotaped parent-infant interaction, as&#xD;
      well as salivary oxytocin samples collection from the mother and from the infant.&#xD;
      Parent-infant interaction will be filmed and assessed using the CIB Manual (Feldman, 1998)&#xD;
      and the synchrony coding system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy mothers will undergo the same baseline assessment and a second assessment within 2-3&#xD;
      months, and won't get any treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Mothers and infants will be treated with dyadic psychotherapy focused on interactions, emphasizing eye contact, body language, empathy, and social reciprocity. Dyadic psychotherapy will be administered one time a week during the 8-week trial period, at the subject's home. Each session, approximately 90 minutes long, will include videotaping mother-infant interaction, watching the last session's interaction as a part of video-feedback technique, and discussing main issues in the mother-infant relationship. In addition, each session will begin and end with a- 5-minute episode of affectionate touch and gaze synchrony between the mother and her infant. During the whole therapy-trial, the therapist will also use cognitive-behavioral approach to address the mother's perception of her infant and of herself as a mother.</description>
