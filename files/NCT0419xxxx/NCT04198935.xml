  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first line of treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes usually entails referral for&#xD;
      diabetes education which has been shown to improve outcomes. The National Diabetes Audit&#xD;
      2016-17 showed an increase in the percentage of patients with type 2 diabetes who are offered&#xD;
      a diabetes education program. Despite this, the percentage of recorded attendance was only&#xD;
      7%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digitally delivered interventions have the potential to solve the problem of adherence to&#xD;
      education programs. Digitally delivered diabetes prevention programs have been shown to have&#xD;
      higher participation than in-person programs. As a solution to this we propose a structured&#xD;
      diabetes education program based on individualized carbohydrate management delivered through&#xD;
      a mobile application. The clinical approach is based on multiple clinical trials&#xD;
      demonstrating its effectiveness and is in line with the most recent NICE guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator interviewed a group of general practitioners and patients to identify the&#xD;
      target group most suited for this solution. Three groups of patients were identified who&#xD;
      would benefit the most from a digital diabetes education program. The first group are&#xD;
      patients who have declined face-to-face education for any reason. The second group are&#xD;
      patients who are on a waiting list for face-to-face education but will not receive it. The&#xD;
      third group are patients who have undergone in-person education but have not clinically&#xD;
      improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the acceptability of this approach among patients with diabetes type 2 the&#xD;
      investigators will use a Net Promoter Score survey. Adherence to the program will be assessed&#xD;
      by measuring the percentage of people completing the whole 3 months. We will also evaluate&#xD;
      whether this approach improves patient outcomes as measured by NICE defined treatment targets&#xD;
      for glucose control, blood pressure and blood cholesterol. Secondary aims include comparing&#xD;
      healthcare resource utilization. Outcomes are to be measured at baseline and at the&#xD;
      completion of the 12 week program. Clinical outcomes to be measured are: body weight, blood&#xD;
      pressure, Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol,&#xD;
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides level.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2019 the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care commissioned The Topol Review:&#xD;
      Preparing the healthcare workforce to deliver the digital future which recommended the&#xD;
      adoption of digital medicine to improve National Health Service (NHS) services and face the&#xD;
      future challenges facing the NHS. Among these challenges is the increasingly alarming burden&#xD;
      of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on the NHS with more than 4 million people diagnosed with&#xD;
      disease and 12 million with pre-diabetes across the United Kingdom (UK). The National&#xD;
      Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) encourages the adoption of individualized approaches&#xD;
      to diabetes care that are tailored to the needs of patients with type 2 diabetes through&#xD;
      structured education programs that are evidence based.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard practice across the UK is to offer patient with T2DM face-to-face structured&#xD;
      education such as DESMOND (Diabetes Education and Self-Management for On-going and Newly&#xD;
      Diagnosed) and the X-pert Health program. These programs follow a face-to-face structured&#xD;
      group education session format.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Diabetes Audit 2016-17 showed an increase in the percentage of patients with&#xD;
      T2DM who are offered a diabetes education program with more ore than 90% of people diagnosed&#xD;
      with T2DM being offered structured education. Despite this, only 7% of these patients&#xD;
      recorded an attendance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digitally delivered interventions have the potential to solve the problem of adherence to&#xD;
      education programs. Digitally delivered diabetes prevention programs have been shown to have&#xD;
      higher participation than in-person programs. The digital nature of these interventions&#xD;
      allows them to be delivered at scale and at a lower cost when compared to in-person programs.&#xD;
      NICE puts great emphasis on individualization of recommendations delivered to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a digitally delivered diabetes education program based on&#xD;
      individualization of carbohydrate intake through regular interactions with a trained&#xD;
      nutritionist via text messaging. The program follows a clinical approach based on&#xD;
      low-carbohydrate and low glycemic index diet recommendations which has been shown to have&#xD;
      better participant retention, greater weight loss and better T2DM outcomes when compared to&#xD;
      other dietary approaches. It is also in line with the latest National Institute for Health&#xD;
      and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines and recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators interviewed a group of general practitioners and patients to identify the&#xD;
      target group most suited for this solution. Three groups of patients were identified who&#xD;
      would benefit the most from a digital diabetes education program. The first group are&#xD;
      patients who have declined face-to-face education for any reason. The second group are&#xD;
      patients who are on a waiting list for face-to-face education but will not receive it. The&#xD;
      third group are patients who have undergone in-person education but have not clinically&#xD;
      improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be invited to download the Span Health mobile application (app). The app&#xD;
      delivers educational content on diabetes and nutrition in a structured format in a 12 week&#xD;
      long program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be invited to have a 1-to-1 consultation with a nutritionist through the&#xD;
      app at the beginning of the program where they will set goals and expectations and a&#xD;
      nutritional plan. They will have weekly consultations to track their progress. The app also&#xD;
      allows participants to ask questions via text messaging at any time which would be directed&#xD;
      to a nutritionist who will provide an answer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The app allows for personal tracking of self-measured blood glucose and ketone levels. It&#xD;
      also contains tools for fasting tracking and nutritional information on common foods along&#xD;
      with a library of food recipes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Span Health program is based on individualized carbohydrate management which aims to&#xD;
      train participants to adopt a low-carbohydrate diet taking into account the patient's&#xD;
      self-measured biometrics and individual tolerances and circumstances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the acceptability of this approach among patients with diabetes type 2 the&#xD;
      investigators will conduct a single arm non-randomised controlled trial recruiting a number&#xD;
      of patients to use the service. Qualitative outcomes will be measured using a Net Promoter&#xD;
      Score survey based on a 0 to 10 scale with a higher score indicating a more favorable&#xD;
      outcome. Adherence to the program will be assessed by measuring the percentage of people&#xD;
      completing the whole 3 months. They will also evaluate whether this approach improves patient&#xD;
      outcomes as measured by NICE defined treatment targets for glucose control, blood pressure&#xD;
      and blood cholesterol. Outcomes are to be measured at baseline and at the completion of the&#xD;
      12 week program. Clinical outcomes to be measured are: body weight, blood pressure, fasting&#xD;
      blood glucose, Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein&#xD;
      cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the increasing availability of digitally delivered diabetes education programs, most&#xD;
      practices still offer in-person programs. Which the increasing burden of diabetes on the NHS.&#xD;
      it is wise to start thinking about more scalable solutions that utilize digital medicine to&#xD;
      approach this problem. This relatively novel approach if proven to be beneficial could lead&#xD;
      to wider studies and a discussion on changing the current approach recommended by NICE.&#xD;
