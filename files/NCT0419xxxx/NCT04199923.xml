  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Loss of muscle can be caused by a variety of stimuli and results in reduced mobility and&#xD;
      strength and also impacts whole body health. Whilst it is known that muscles waste the&#xD;
      process by which this occurs is not well understood. Furthermore, whilst some muscles waste&#xD;
      quickly others seem resistant to the effects of disuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate how quickly changes in muscles start to occur, and investigate&#xD;
      the processes which underlie muscle atrophy. By studying muscles which waste quickly and&#xD;
      those which are resistant to atrophy this study aims to identify the different processes&#xD;
      which lead to muscle loss. This study will also evaluate the differences in muscle changes&#xD;
      between young and old people.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Skeletal muscles host ~40% of all protein in the body. Muscles are not only crucial for&#xD;
      locomotion but also represent the body's largest metabolically active tissue, glucose&#xD;
      disposal site and fuel reservoir for other organs in pathological conditions (i.e., supply of&#xD;
      amino acids to the liver for gluconeogenesis). Muscle atrophy is characterized by a reduction&#xD;
      in cross sectional area (CSA) and length and occurs in many common illnesses (e.g. cancers&#xD;
      (1), renal/heart failure, sepsis, genetic diseases, neurodegenerative disorders etc). It is&#xD;
      also prevalent in situations of reduced neural input such as leg casting after fractures (2),&#xD;
      bed-rest, spinal cord injury (3), space flight and chronic physical inactivity. Atrophy&#xD;
      results in a loss of muscle power and strength (which is related to increased morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality (4)) and reduced capacities for whole-body glucose storage and metabolism which&#xD;
      causes insulin resistance. Strategies to oppose atrophy are limited but include mechanical&#xD;
      loading (5) and the synergistic anabolic effects of nutrients. Although muscle atrophy is of&#xD;
      great clinical importance, relatively little mechanistic research has been done in humans.&#xD;
      Thus, the aim of this study is to assess the link between the variation in muscle&#xD;
      physiological responses to disuse atrophy with variation in protein turnover and&#xD;
      molecular-networks. This will not only provide new hypotheses for physiological regulation of&#xD;
      human muscle and generate 'intervention targets' derived from clinically relevant human&#xD;
      studies, it will also improve understanding of whether the response to disuse is altered with&#xD;
      age and determine if mechanistic differences in atrophy resistant and atrophy sensitive&#xD;
      muscles might explain inter-muscular variation in susceptibility to atrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to define the molecular and metabolic mechanisms causing disuse atrophy in&#xD;
      both young and older individuals and explore how and why some muscles are protected against&#xD;
      it. The study will also assess temporal aspects of disuse atrophy (in younger individuals&#xD;
      only) to explore the mechanistic basis for the more rapid atrophy observed in the early days&#xD;
      of disuse.&#xD;
