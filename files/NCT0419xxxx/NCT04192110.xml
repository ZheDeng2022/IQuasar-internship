  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Almost 15% of Americans have chronic kidney disease (CKD), with an even higher rate in&#xD;
      Veterans due to common risk factors such as high blood pressure and diabetes. People with CKD&#xD;
      have a high risk of cardiovascular (CV) diseases, such as heart attacks, heart failure, and&#xD;
      strokes. Extra fluid in the body, called volume overload, may lead to CV disease in people&#xD;
      with CKD. It is unknown if volume overload develops in the earliest stages of CKD, when&#xD;
      treating it with common, inexpensive medicines called diuretics may improve long-term CV&#xD;
      outcomes. This study will lay important groundwork to answer this question in Veterans with&#xD;
      early CKD by comparing two ways to measure volume overload and studying the change in common&#xD;
      symptoms like fatigue and short-term CV function after treatment with diuretic medicines.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators previously showed that brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and&#xD;
      N-terminal-pro-BNP (NT-pro-BNP), measures of ventricular stretch, are associated with death&#xD;
      and cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 1-3 patients, and the&#xD;
      investigators' preliminary pilot results suggest that these natriuretic peptides may&#xD;
      correlate with objective measures of excess extracellular volume (ECV) and with symptoms&#xD;
      common in CKD. The overarching objective is to determine if initiation of diuretic treatment&#xD;
      or increase in dose is associated with changes in BNP and NT-pro-BNP, patient-reported&#xD;
      symptom burden, and short-term hemodynamic parameters in patients with CKD stages 1-3 and&#xD;
      elevated blood pressure, and whether these changes correlate with changes in ECV. The central&#xD;
      hypothesis is that the change in ECV after starting or increasing diuretics in Veterans with&#xD;
      stages 1-3 CKD is associated with changes in 1) natriuretic peptides, 2) patient-level&#xD;
      factors, and 3) CV physiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will compare the changes in natriuretic peptides, symptoms, and CV&#xD;
      parameters with the change in ECV after diuretic initiation or dose increase. The primary aim&#xD;
      is to determine if initiation of diuretic treatment or increase in diuretic dose is&#xD;
      associated with changes in natriuretic peptides. Secondary aims are to determine the effect&#xD;
      of diuretic change on patient-reported symptom burden, and CV physiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial will include 46 outpatients with CKD stages 1-3 and blood pressure&#xD;
      &gt;140/90 mmHg. At the first visit, I will initiate or increase the dose of a thiazide or loop&#xD;
      diuretic. Study measures other than echocardiogram will be repeated 4 weeks after the&#xD;
      intervention to determine changes in these parameters. ECV will be measured by whole-body&#xD;
      multifrequency bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS), which is a validated, non-invasive, painless&#xD;
      measure of ECV. Plasma BNP and NT-pro-BNP will be measured, and patient-reported fatigue,&#xD;
      depression, and quality of life will be quantified using validated questionnaires.&#xD;
      Hemodynamic parameters include blood pressure, pulse pressure, total peripheral resistance&#xD;
      index (TPRI), and cardiac index measured by Non-Invasive Cardiac Output Monitoring. A&#xD;
      transthoracic echocardiogram will measure left ventricular mass index, valvular disease, and&#xD;
      diastolic dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables will be compared within participants between baseline and Visit 2 using paired&#xD;
      Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests or paired Student's t tests, depending on variable distributions.&#xD;
      Correlations between change in ECV/total body weight and all continuous outcome measures will&#xD;
      be analyzed using Spearman or Pearson correlations, applying appropriate transformations.&#xD;
      Linear regression analysis will control for clinically relevant variables. The relationship&#xD;
      between ECV/total body weight and natriuretic peptides from both visits will be evaluated&#xD;
      using a mixed effects model to account for the change in these measures between baseline and&#xD;
      Visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is minimal risk to human subjects. Participants may benefit from improved control&#xD;
      of their blood pressure. The knowledge to be gained may also benefit others in the future.&#xD;

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The presence of CKD stages 1, 2, or 3, as defined below by National Kidney Foundation&#xD;
             guidelines, for a period of at least 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Stage 1: eGFR 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 and spot urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio 30&#xD;
                  mg/g.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Stage 2: eGFR 60-89 mL/min/1.73 m2 and spot urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio 30&#xD;
                  mg/g.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Stage 3: eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measured blood pressure either &gt;140 mmHg systolic or &gt;90 mmHg diastolic at the two&#xD;
             most recent clinic visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Rationale: The investigators' unpublished preliminary data show that blood&#xD;
                  pressure correlates with both BNP and NT-pro-BNP more strongly in those with CKD&#xD;
                  than those without CKD. Thus, selecting hypertensive individuals is more likely&#xD;
                  to identify those with elevated natriuretic peptides in the CKD group.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Furthermore, starting or increasing a diuretic medication is part of standard of&#xD;
                  care to treat blood pressures &gt;140/90 mmHg, so the study intervention will be&#xD;
                  consistent with appropriate care for the Veteran and avoid hypotension.&#xD;
&#xD;

             fully explained.&#xD;

             components.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CKD stages 4-5, defined as eGFR &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving chronic hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recipient of a kidney transplant.&#xD;

             of available echocardiogram data.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hepatic cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
