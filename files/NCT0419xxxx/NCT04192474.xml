  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the new aScope 4 Cysto is used to see if this new single use, flexible&#xD;
      cystoscope performs as well as other routinely used flexible cystoscopes. This study will be&#xD;
      done in patients who come to the clinic for either a diagnosis of their urethra and bladder&#xD;
      or for a small intervention. For an intervention a lesion or tumor is resected, a stent in&#xD;
      the ureter is taken out, or an injection in the bladder wall is given. The flexible&#xD;
      cystoscope is passed into the urethra and bladder for visual inspection of the bladder and&#xD;
      urethra. It will give information on how well the structures of the urinary tract and bladder&#xD;
      can be viewed including any abnormalities that are present. If an intervention is performed&#xD;
      the aScope 4 Cysto will be used with an endoscopic accessory.&#xD;

      Clinical Phase: pre-CE study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A prospective, multicenter, single- arm open-label clinical study on the performance&#xD;
      and safety of Ambu® aScope™ 4 Cysto and aView™ Urologia, a single-use, flexible cystoscope&#xD;
      for flexible cystoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: Adult subjects (≥ 18 years) undergoing flexible cystoscopy for diagnostic or&#xD;
      therapeutic purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned Sample Size: A total of 80 patients will result in a maximum (if the true proportion&#xD;
      is 50 %) width (i.e. the difference between the point estimate and the upper, or lower, limit&#xD;
      of the confidence interval) of the two-sided 95 % confidence interval for the binary variable&#xD;
      &quot;Performance level acceptable&quot; to be 11%. This width is considered to be useful in the&#xD;
      interpretations of the results from this part of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration: Screening, procedure and follow-up will take 14 days maximum. A follow-up&#xD;
      telephone call at 7 days post procedure is performed to record any adverse events&#xD;
      post-procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned Trial Period: 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational Device: Ambu® aScope™ 4 Cysto and aView™ Urologia. A pre-CE, single use&#xD;
      cystoscope.&#xD;
