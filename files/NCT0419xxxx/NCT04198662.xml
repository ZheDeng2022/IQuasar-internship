    <textblock>
      Rib fractures are one of the most common injuries in trauma patients. These fractures are&#xD;
      associated with significant pain as well as decreased ability to inspire deeply or cough to&#xD;
      clear secretions, which together lead to pulmonary complications and a high degree of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. Peripheral nerve blocks as well as epidural blocks have been used&#xD;
      with success to improve pain control in rib fracture patients and have been associated with&#xD;
      decreased pulmonary complications and improved outcomes. However, a single-injection nerve&#xD;
      block lasts less than 24 hours; and, even a continuous nerve block is generally limited to&#xD;
      3-4 days. The pain from rib fractures usually persists for multiple weeks or months. In&#xD;
      contrast to local anesthetic-induced nerve blocks, a prolonged block lasting a few&#xD;
      weeks/months may be provided by freezing the nerve using a process called &quot;cryoneurolysis&quot;.&#xD;
      The goal of this multicenter, randomized, double-masked, sham-controlled, parallel-arm study&#xD;
      is to evaluate the potential of cryoanalgesia to decrease pain and improve pulmonary&#xD;
      mechanics in patients with rib fractures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ultimate objective of the proposed line of research is to determine if cryoanalgesia is&#xD;
      an effective treatment for pain associated with rib fractures; and, if this analgesic&#xD;
      modality improves pulmonary mechanics measured with incentive spirometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To determine if, compared with current and customary analgesia for rib&#xD;
      fracture(s), intercostal nerve cryoneurolysis improves maximum inspiratory volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1a: The maximum inspired volume will be significantly increased on the day&#xD;
      following the procedure [primary endpoint] as well as at other time points following the&#xD;
      procedure [secondary end points] with intercostal cryoanalgesia as compared single-injection&#xD;
      local anesthetic-based intercostal nerve blocks [measured with an incentive spirometer].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1b: The maximum inspired volume as a percentage of the baseline will be&#xD;
      significantly increased on the day following the procedure [secondary endpoint of greatest&#xD;
      interest], as well as at other time points following the procedure [secondary end points]&#xD;
      with intercostal cryoanalgesia as compared with single-injection local anesthetic-based&#xD;
      intercostal nerve blocks [measured with an incentive spirometer].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine if, compared with current and customary analgesia, intercostal&#xD;
      nerve cryoneurolysis decreases the pain associated with rib fracture(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2a: The severity of rib fracture pain at rest will be significantly decreased&#xD;
      within the 12 months following the procedure with intercostal cryoneurolysis as compared with&#xD;
      subjects receiving single-injection local anesthetic-based intercostal nerve blocks [measured&#xD;
      using the Numeric Rating Scale for pain].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2b: The severity of rib fracture pain when using the spirometer or coughing will&#xD;
      be significantly decreased within the 12 months following the procedure with intercostal&#xD;
      cryoneurolysis as compared with subjects receiving single-injection local anesthetic-based&#xD;
      intercostal nerve blocks [measured using the Numeric Rating Scale for pain].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2c: The incidence of chronic pain will be significantly decreased 6 and 12 months&#xD;
      following a rib fracture with intercostal cryoeurolysis as compared with subjects receiving&#xD;
      single-injection local anesthetic-based intercostal nerve blocks [measured using the Numeric&#xD;
      Rating Scale for pain].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2d: The severity of chronic pain will be significantly decreased 6 and 12 months&#xD;
      following a rib fracture with intercostal cryoneurolysis as compared with subjects receiving&#xD;
      single-injection local anesthetic-based intercostal nerve blocks [measured using the Numeric&#xD;
      Rating Scale for pain].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cryoneurolysis procedure will be compared with our current standard practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Overview Day 0 Baseline pain levels and spirometry Subjects randomized and&#xD;
      cryoneurolysis/sham procedure administered Post-block pain levels and spirometry repeated&#xD;
&#xD;
      Days 1, 2, 7 Pain levels, opioid consumption, sleep disturbances due to pain, and incentive&#xD;
      spirometry values collected [as well as the day of discharge]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Months 0.5, 1, 1.5 , 2, 3, 6, and 12 Pain levels, opioid consumption, sleep disturbances due&#xD;
      to pain, and pain interference collected [and incentive spirometry if subject has spirometer&#xD;
      available]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be individuals who present to one of the UCSD hospitals with rib fracture(s)&#xD;
      and significant pain. Both universities will be following the same protocol and the subjects&#xD;
      from both institutions will be combined for the analysis. Those who consent to participate in&#xD;
      this study will have standard ultrasound-guided intercostal nerve blocks administered with&#xD;
      ropivacaine 0.5% (with epinephrine), 3 mL/level of each fracture rib as well as one level&#xD;
      above and one level below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment group assignment (randomization). Subjects will be allocated to one of two possible&#xD;
      treatments stratified by treatment center and unilateral vs. bilateral fractures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. active cryoneurolysis (sham local anesthetic intercostal blocks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. sham cryoneurolysis (active local anesthetic intercostal blocks)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computer-generated randomization lists created by the UC San Diego Investigational Drug&#xD;
      Service will be used to create sealed, opaque randomization envelopes with the treatment&#xD;
      group assignment enclosed in each envelope labeled with the randomization number. The lists&#xD;
      will be kept by the Investigational Drug Service and not provided to the investigators until&#xD;
      completion of data collection (1 year following enrollment of the final subject).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific intercostal nerves targeted will depend on the injury site. The treatment sites&#xD;
      will be cleansed with chlorhexidine gluconate and isopropyl alcohol. Using the optimal&#xD;
      ultrasound transducer for the specific anatomic location and subject anatomy (linear vs&#xD;
      curvilinear array), the target nerves will be identified in a transverse cross-sectional&#xD;
      (short axis) view. The intercostal nerve of each fractured rib as well as the level above and&#xD;
      below will be treated with the protocol below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intercostal nerve block procedure: The target nerve will be visualized with ultrasound. Local&#xD;
      anesthetic (1% lidocaine) will be used to infiltrate the skin and underlying muscle at each&#xD;
      entry point. A 20 g Tuohy needle will be introduced through the skin wheel and along the&#xD;
      anesthetized muscle tract. For subjects randomized to active cryo, 3 mL of normal saline will&#xD;
      be injected into the muscle superficial to the nerve; and for subjects randomized to sham&#xD;
      cryo, 3 mL of ropivacaine 0.5% (with epinephrine) will be injected perineurally to provide&#xD;
      the intercostal nerve block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cryoneurolysis procedure: Cryoneurolysis probes are available for a console neurolysis device&#xD;
      (PainBlocker, Epimed, Farmers Branch, Texas) that either (1) pass nitrous oxide to the tip&#xD;
      inducing freezing temperatures; or, (2) vent the nitrous oxide at the base of the probe so&#xD;
      that no gas reaches the probe tip, resulting in no temperature change. The latter is a sham&#xD;
      procedure since without the temperature change, no ice ball forms and therefore the target&#xD;
      nerve is not affected. An angiocatheter/introducer will be inserted beneath the ultrasound&#xD;
      transducer and directed until the probe tip is immediately adjacent to the target nerve. The&#xD;
      angiocatheter needle will be removed, leaving the angiocatheter through which the appropriate&#xD;
      Epimed probe will be inserted until it is adjacent to the target nerve. The cryoneurolysis&#xD;
      device will be triggered using 2 cycles of 2-minute gas activation (active or sham) separated&#xD;
      by 1-minute defrost periods. For active probes, the nitrous oxide will be deployed to the tip&#xD;
      where a drop in temperature to -70°C will result in cryoneurolysis. For the sham probes, the&#xD;
      nitrous oxide will be vented prior to reaching the probe shaft, resulting in a lack of&#xD;
      perineural temperature change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The process will be repeated with the same treatment probe for any additional nerves (e.g.,&#xD;
      all nerves will receive either active cryoneurolysis or sham/placebo, and not a mix of the&#xD;
      two possible treatments).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: The primary endpoint is the maximum inspired volume measured by&#xD;
      incentive spirometry the day following treatment. There is no accepted minimal&#xD;
      clinically-relevant change in incentive spirometry volume. However, the median (IQR) of&#xD;
      inspired volume for patients with rib fracture(s) is 1250 (750-1750) mL; and, ISV&lt;1000 mL is&#xD;
      associated with an increased risk of acute respiratory failure. The investigators will&#xD;
      therefore use the difference between 1250 and 1000 (250 mL) as the minimal&#xD;
      clinically-relevant difference. However, there is high variability in the reported increase&#xD;
      in inspired volume with various regional analgesic interventions such as continuous&#xD;
      intercostal nerve blocks and serratus plane blocks, and the investigators will therefore&#xD;
      increase our enrollment to account for an unpredicted increase in variability or non-normal&#xD;
      data distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      But, assuming a normal distribution, the interquartile range is approximately 1.35 standard&#xD;
      deviations (SDs). Therefore an interquartile range of 250-50 = 200 mL (Hernandez et al. 2019)&#xD;
      corresponds to, approximately, an SD of 200/1.35 = 148 mL. Assuming this SD of 148 mL, a&#xD;
      sample size of n=7 per group provides 80% power to detect a group difference of d=250 mL per&#xD;
      group with two sided Type 1 Error 5%. To allow for a larger-than-anticipated SD, we will&#xD;
      enroll 10 subjects per group with an evaluable primary outcome measure (n=20 for both groups&#xD;
      combined). Accounting for drop-outs, we request a maximum enrollment of 30 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous data will be summarized with mean, SDs, medians, quartiles, and ranges; and&#xD;
      displayed with box-and-whisker plots by group and in aggregate. Key baseline characteristics&#xD;
      will be tested between groups using two-sample t-tests, and summarized with Cohen's D, for&#xD;
      continuous measures; and Fisher's Exact test for categorical variables. The primary outcome&#xD;
      is maximum incentive spirometry volume (ISV) measured in mL on POD 1. The group difference&#xD;
      will be tested using Welch's two-sample test. Secondary outcomes will also be tested with the&#xD;
      two-sample t-test. No multiplicity adjustments will be applied for these secondary outcomes.&#xD;
      The Wilcoxon signed-rank test will be used as a sensitivity analysis. Secondary analyses will&#xD;
      include a Mixed Model of Repeated Measures with fixed-effects for time, time-by-group,&#xD;
      unilateral vs bilateral, and the number of fractures. The model will treat time as a&#xD;
      categorical variable and will assume a compound symmetric correlation and heterogeneous&#xD;
      variance with respect to time. The estimated mean difference between groups at the final&#xD;
      scheduled timepoint will be the parameter of interest and will be tested using Kenward-Roger&#xD;
      degrees of freedom. Outcomes only measured at baseline and a single follow-up timepoint will&#xD;
      be analyses with Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA). The dependent variable will be change from&#xD;
      baseline, and covariates will include group, baseline outcome, unilateral vs bilateral, and&#xD;
      the number of fractures. Missing data is not expected due to the short follow-up in this&#xD;
      study. However, if missing data issues arise, the investigators will use multiple imputation&#xD;
      which is robust to covariate-dependent Missing at Random, and tipping point analyses under&#xD;
      various Missing Not at Random assumptions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigational Drug Pharmacists and investigators doing the study procedures will be the&#xD;
      only individuals aware of the treatment group assignments. The Investigational Drug Service&#xD;
      will not provide the treatment group assignments to the investigators until the completion of&#xD;
      data collection for all subjects; and will only provide &quot;Treatment A&quot; vs &quot;Treatment B&quot;&#xD;
      assignments for the initial statistical analysis. Only at the completion of statistical&#xD;
      analysis will each treatment be revealed to the investigators.&#xD;
