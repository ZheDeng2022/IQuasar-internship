  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 study, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of&#xD;
      oral CVN424 at two dose levels (low-dose and high-dose) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients&#xD;
      with motor fluctuations.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 135 male and female subjects with Parkinson's disease, on a stable dosage of&#xD;
      levodopa but with an average of ≥ 2 h total OFF time/day and not less than 1 h per day, will&#xD;
      be enrolled. Following baseline safety and efficacy assessments, subjects will be randomized&#xD;
      to receive once-daily doses of either low-dose CVN424, high-dose CVN424, or matching placebo.&#xD;
      All subjects not randomized to placebo will initiate treatment with a low-dose of CVN424 on&#xD;
      Day 1; the low-dose arm will continue to receive their low dose each day, while the high-dose&#xD;
      arm will increase their daily dosage to the high-dose CVN424 beginning on Day 8 ±2 days and&#xD;
      continuing thereafter. Study drug will be self-administered each morning as an oral&#xD;
      suspension. Subjects will continue their other PD medications.&#xD;
