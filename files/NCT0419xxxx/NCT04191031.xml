      Primary objective: The primary objective of this study is to evaluate either a) the&#xD;
      postsurgical total opioid consumption or b) postsurgical pain control after presurgical&#xD;
      iovera° treatment plus EXPAREL® and standardized multimodal therapy compared with presurgical&#xD;
      sham iovera° treatment plus EXPAREL and standardized multimodal therapy in subjects&#xD;
      undergoing primary unilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA). A single primary objective,&#xD;
      either a or b, will be declared by an unblinded Independent Review Committee (IRC) in an&#xD;
      interim analysis after 30 randomized and treated subjects complete the Day 42 assessments.&#xD;
      The primary objective not selected will be placed in the secondary objectives category.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: The secondary objectives of this study are to compare postsurgical pain&#xD;
      control or postsurgical total opioid consumption (whichever is not chosen as the primary&#xD;
      objective), opioid-free status, physical function, sleep quality, and safety of presurgical&#xD;
      iovera° treatment plus EXPAREL and standardized multimodal therapy with presurgical sham&#xD;
      iovera° treatment plus EXPAREL and standardized multimodal therapy in subjects undergoing&#xD;
      primary unilateral TKA&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double blind, sham controlled study in adult&#xD;
      subjects undergoing TKA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be screened no more than 60 days prior to TKA. During the screening visit,&#xD;
      subjects will be assessed for past or present neurologic, cardiac, and general medical&#xD;
      conditions that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude them from study&#xD;
      participation. No procedures other than the site's standard of care will be performed before&#xD;
      signed informed consent is obtained. After the informed consent form (ICF) is signed,&#xD;
      demographic information, medical and surgical history, concomitant medications/concurrent&#xD;
      procedures information and vital signs will be collected. Assessment of the intended&#xD;
      treatment areas, functional-ability assessments, a urine drug screen, and a urine pregnancy&#xD;
      test (UPT) for women of childbearing potential will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: initially 60 subjects will be randomized 1:1 (30 subjects per group) to one of&#xD;
      two treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: subjects will receive iovera° cryoneurolysis treatment of superficial genicular&#xD;
      nerves (anterior femoral cutaneous nerve [AFCN] and infrapatellar branches of the saphenous&#xD;
      nerve [ISN]) of the target knee&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: subjects will receive sham iovera° treatment of superficial genicular nerves (AFCN&#xD;
      and ISN) of the target knee&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects in all groups will also receive intraoperative local infiltration with EXPAREL&#xD;
      and postoperative multimodal pain medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the results of an interim analysis, a primary endpoint between a) the postsurgical&#xD;
      total opioid consumption or b) postsurgical pain control will be chosen and additional&#xD;
      subjects may be enrolled (up to an estimated target of 200 subjects in total)..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked questions and/or be asked to fill forms as part of the following&#xD;
      assessments: Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) to assess pain scores and sleep quality, functional&#xD;
      (physical) ability tests to assess range of motions, and KOOS questionnaire to assess knee&#xD;
      movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iovera° treatment or iovera° sham treatment (Day -15 [±7 days] prior to TKA). TKA surgery&#xD;
      will be Day 1 and follow up will be up to Day 90. Therefore, subjects may participate in the&#xD;
      study for up to 155 days.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. History of prior contralateral TKA within 6 months or open knee surgery on the knee&#xD;
             being considered for TKA. Prior arthroscopy is permitted.&#xD;

          4. Concurrent painful physical condition that may require analgesic treatment (such as an&#xD;
             NSAID or opioid) in the postsurgical period for pain that is not strictly related to&#xD;
             the knee surgery and which may confound the postsurgical assessments (e.g.,&#xD;
             significant pain from other joints including the non-index knee joint, chronic&#xD;
             neuropathic pain, concurrent or prior contralateral TKA, concurrent foot surgery).&#xD;

             ability to participate in the study and postsurgical rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Allergy, hypersensitivity, intolerance, or contraindication to any of the study&#xD;

             norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), gabapentin, or duloxetine (Cymbalta®). If&#xD;
             a subject is taking one of these medications for a reason other than pain control, he&#xD;

&#xD;
         23. Open and/or infected wounds at or near the treatment site.&#xD;

             subject's participation in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Given the COVID-19 pandemic, the subject must be medically fit/cleared for surgery by the&#xD;

        COVID-19 illness/symptoms (or other serious illness), the subject must be excluded per&#xD;
        Exclusion criterion #5.&#xD;
