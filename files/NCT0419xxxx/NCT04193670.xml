  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The skin is innervated by a network of nociceptive sensory neurons (nociceptors) whose&#xD;
      primary function is the transmission of pain and pruritus signals to the central nervous&#xD;
      system. Their role in atopic dermatitis (AD), characterized by an exacerbated type 2 immune&#xD;
      response, is only partially understood. Nevertheless, large amounts of neuropeptides,&#xD;
      including substance P (SP), are found in the serum of patients, their level being correlated&#xD;
      with the clinical severity of AD. Mast cells (MC) are part of the cells of the immune system&#xD;
      residing in the skin. MCs have neuro-receptors of the Mas-related G protein-coupled receptors&#xD;
      family (MRGPR) and in particular MRGPRX2 (the receptor for cationic molecules [including SP]&#xD;
      for MCs) through which they could communicate in a privileged way. with the nociceptors.&#xD;
      Preliminary data obtained in mice show that its mouse orthologue &quot;MrgprB2&quot; is absolutely&#xD;
      necessary for the development of type 2 immunity and the pathological characteristics of a&#xD;
      preclinical &quot;DA-like&quot; model (manuscript in preparation). The investigators therefore&#xD;
      hypothesize that the activation of MCs expressing MRGPRX2 by nociceptors producing SP plays a&#xD;
      key role in the development of type 2 inflammation in AD in humans.&#xD;
