  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Inhibiting the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) has been observed to reduce&#xD;
      risk of cardiovascular events and kidney failure in type 2 diabetes. The exact mechanisms of&#xD;
      the beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibition (SGLT2i) are still unknown. Kidney hypoxia has&#xD;
      been demonstrated in diabetic kidney disease and SGLT2i is thought to relieve hypoxia in the&#xD;
      kidneys. Mitochondrial dysfunction and autonomic dysfunction might also contribute to kidney&#xD;
      hypoxia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary aim of the study is to assess the acute effects of SGLT2 inhibition on&#xD;
      parameters reflecting oxygenation and oxygen consumption of the human kidney in persons with&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes. Exploratory aims are to investigate acute changes in oxygen availability and&#xD;
      oxygen access to the kidneys after SGLT2i. This include measures of peripheral blood&#xD;
      oxygenation, mitochondrial function and autonomic function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Acute intervention study with oral dapagliflozin given in two doses each of 50 mg or&#xD;
      matching placebo as intervention. Kidney oxygenation and perfusion parameters will be&#xD;
      assessed by blood-oxygen-dependant level magnetic resonance imaging. Mitochondrial function&#xD;
      will be assessed by extracellular flux analysis on lymphocytes. Autonomic function will be&#xD;
      assessed by measuring baroreflex sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over intervention study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Fifteen healthy controls are recruited by advertisement and 15 patients&#xD;
      with type 1 diabetes recruited from Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints: Primary end-point: Renal cortical and medullary oxygenation (T2*). Exploratory&#xD;
      end-points: Renal cortical and medullary perfusion, renal artery flow, renal oxygen&#xD;
      consumption, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2), arterial oxygen partial pressure&#xD;
      (PaO2), arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), lymphocyte mitochondrial function, baroreflex&#xD;
      sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeframe: Inclusion of patients from January 2020. Last patient last visit January 2021.&#xD;
      Data analysis completed spring 2021, presentation autumn 2021 and publications Winter 2021.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Group allocation is concealed to patients as well as investigators. 60 sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes will be produced by Glostrup Apotek. All persons involved in the conduct of the study are blinded to the randomization code. Randomization codes and envelopes are stored securely at the study site available only for the unblinded site staff in charge of randomizing subjects and dispensing study products to subjects. Sealed codes are marked according to randomization code and distributed according to a pre-distributed order. Should unblinding of a study participant be necessary because of an emergency, a dedicated person at Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen, not involved in the study, will perform the procedure. Alternatively, the Principal investigator will be able to perform unblinding</masking_description>

Common side effects include hypoglycemia, hypotension, elevated hematocrite, dyslipidemia, back pain, dizziness, skin rash, urinary tract infection, vulvovaginitis and dehydration. Very rare incidents of ketoacidosis have been observed. Side effects have only been observed after use in longer periods and not in single-dose usage, as planned in the present study. A dose of 50 mg has been chosen to achieve optimal efficacy. Once-per-day doses of dapagliflozin for 12 weeks of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg and 50 mg have been demonstrated to be relatively safe across the mentioned doses (20) and no apparent risk is expected from instituting two single-doses of 50 mg dapagliflozin.</description>
