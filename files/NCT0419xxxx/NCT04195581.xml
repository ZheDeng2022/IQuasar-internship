  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a randomized, open-label, crossover study, controlled by cross-comparison. Subjects&#xD;
      were randomized to wear each lens and solution combination for a month in random sequence;&#xD;
      that is for a total of six months.&#xD;

Dryness which definitely affects wearing my contact lenses, 40 - Poor. A level of dryness which is sometimes annoying, 60 - Good. Acceptable level of dryness, 80 - Very good. Very occasional or very slight sensation of dryness only, 100 - Excellent. I have no sensation of dryness whatsoever).</description>
