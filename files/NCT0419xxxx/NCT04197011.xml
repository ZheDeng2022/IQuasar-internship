  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lower limb amputation is an emerging global health concern. Currently, there are over 1.6&#xD;
      million amputees in the U.S. and around 6000 new amputations are recorded per annum in the&#xD;
      UK. These numbers are expected to double by 2050 due to the increasing aging population and&#xD;
      the adverse health issues such as diabetes, representing a significant, growing problem in&#xD;
      western society. A lower limb amputation results in the loss of the biological joint&#xD;
      structures such as the ankle and knee, along with the associated musculature. In order to&#xD;
      overcome these physical losses, many lower limb amputees are provided with a prosthetic limb&#xD;
      that enable them to participate in activities of daily living. The design and function of&#xD;
      these prosthetic limbs varies widely, with some being very basic, non-articulating,&#xD;
      semi-rigid structures while other more advanced components are computer controlled or&#xD;
      incorporate robotic function. Lower limb amputees have been shown to fall more often when&#xD;
      compared to age matched individuals without lower limb amputation. This has been reported to&#xD;
      be partly a result of a less stable walking pattern. Given that the prosthetic limb provided&#xD;
      and it's functional capability is a large component of how well a lower limb amputee is able&#xD;
      to walk, it is important to understand what the effects of and potential benefits are from&#xD;
      using more advanced prosthetic devices, such as micro-processor controlled knee joints and&#xD;
      articulating ankle joints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of the current study is to investigate the effects of combining more&#xD;
      advanced prosthetic ankle-foot and knee components on the biomechanics of activities of daily&#xD;
      living in individuals with above knee amputation.&#xD;

      Study Background Lower limb amputation is an emerging global health concern. Currently, there&#xD;
      are over 1.6 million amputees in the U.S. and around 6000 new amputations are recorded per&#xD;
      annum in the UK. These numbers are expected to double by 2050 due to the increasing aging&#xD;
      population and the adverse health issues such as diabetes, representing a significant,&#xD;
      growing problem in western society. A lower limb amputation results in the loss of the&#xD;
      biological joint structures such as the ankle and knee, along with the associated&#xD;
      musculature. In order to overcome these physical losses, many lower limb amputees are&#xD;
      provided with a prosthetic limb that enable them to participate in activities of daily&#xD;
      living. The design and function of these prosthetic limbs varies widely, with some being very&#xD;
      basic non-articulating semi-rigid structures while other more advanced components are&#xD;
      computer controlled and function robotically. Advanced ankle components have been shown to&#xD;
      provide lower limb amputees with a number of benefits including increased walking speed,&#xD;
      improved symmetry between legs and increased forward progression. In addition,&#xD;
      micro-processor controlled knee components, recently made available through the NHS via NHS&#xD;
      England Clinical commissioning, have shown a number of benefits. These benefits are stated as&#xD;
      being 'â€¦enhanced stability and stumble recovery, which improves fall management and reduces&#xD;
      the incidence of falls. This supports the increases in self-reported improved individual&#xD;
      mobility and independence. MPKs also improve controlled sitting and standing, walking gait&#xD;
      symmetry, stair decent, controlled step over step descent down a slope, reduced energy&#xD;
      expenditure, and given different modes for different activities an ability to manage&#xD;
      obstacles more easily'. Given that the prosthetic limb provided and their functional&#xD;
      capability is a large component of how well a lower limb amputee is able to walk, it is&#xD;
      important to understand what the effects of and potential benefits are from using more&#xD;
      advanced prosthetic devices, such as micro-processor controlled knee joints. Also, as these&#xD;
      components are used in conjunction with ankle-foot devices, it is important to know what the&#xD;
      optimal combination may be to gain the most benefits from both prosthetic components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aim The aim of the current study is to investigate the effects of combining more&#xD;
      advanced prosthetic ankle-foot and knee components on the biomechanics of activities of daily&#xD;
      living in individuals with above knee amputation.&#xD;

        participants (CRTL). Both groups are required to satisfy inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
        and provide written informed consent in order to participate.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Transfemoral amputation: Individuals who have had unilateral transfemoral amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Demographics: Adult, community-dwelling individuals above the age of 18 in order to&#xD;

             time in order to complete the clinical walking tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Vision: Good (corrected) vision to safely walk in well-lit areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Cardiovascular Health: No self-reported unresolved cardiovascular complaints to avoid&#xD;
             any cardiovascular complications when performing activities of daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Able to travel: Data collection will take place at Nottingham Trent University,&#xD;
             Clifton Campus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For the otherwise healthy control (CTRL) group, the same criteria apply, with the exception&#xD;
        of those pertaining specifically to amputation status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pain: Experience undue musculo-skeletal pain during walking that causes individual to&#xD;
             stop and not be able to continue when walking at a self-selected speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Disease/Illness: Unable and/or unsafe to carry out tasks due to disease/illness such&#xD;
             as rheumatoid arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Injury: Current neuromuscular, musculoskeletal injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Falls: Falls regularly (&gt;1 a month) as determined using the PROFANE fall definition.&#xD;
             Excludes recreational, sporting or occupational falls outside of this definition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Residuum health: Presence of significant blisters, wounds and rash which prevent&#xD;
             prosthesis, sock and liner to be worn comfortably.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Residuum stability: Observing substantial changes to the physical condition of the&#xD;
             lower limb that requires medical attention as judged by the participant, and if after&#xD;
             consenting and participating in the study, individuals are referred to mobility&#xD;
             services due to a degradation of the physical condition of either lower limb.&#xD;

          7. Unable to follow instruction or cognitive deficits: Risk of further injury whilst&#xD;
             completing tasks incorrectly.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Not able to understand written and verbal English: All communication will be in&#xD;
             English as the University does not provide translation services.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. For the otherwise healthy control (CTRL) group, the same criteria apply, with the&#xD;
             exception of those pertaining specifically to amputation status.&#xD;
