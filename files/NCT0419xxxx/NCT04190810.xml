  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The approach and avoidance task (AAT) has evolved as a promising treatment add-on in the&#xD;
      realm of psychology. Certain psychiatric diseases, such as behavioural addictions, social&#xD;
      anxiety disorder, and arachnophobia, are characterized by a dysfunctional tendency to either&#xD;
      approach or avoid disease-specific objects. This tendency can be measured by means of the&#xD;
      approach and avoidance task. More precisely, by a diagnostic AAT, in which participants are&#xD;
      instructed to react upon the format or the frame colour of a picture. For instance, pictures&#xD;
      have to be pushed away if they are presented in landscape format and pulled towards oneself&#xD;
      if they are presented in portrait format (or vice versa). Hence, the format (or the frame&#xD;
      colour) becomes the task-relevant dimension, whereas the content of the picture becomes&#xD;
      irrelevant for task completion. However, what generally becomes obvious in the psychiatric&#xD;
      diseases mentioned above is that the task-irrelevant dimension (picture content) exerts an&#xD;
      influence on reaction times. For instance, smokers are generally faster to respond to&#xD;
      smoking-related pictures, when presented in a format requiring them to pull towards&#xD;
      themselves, and slower to respond, if smoking pictures are shown in the format requiring them&#xD;
      to push away a joystick (Wiers et al., 2013). This behavioural tendency has been termed an&#xD;
      approach bias for cigarettes or smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to counteract these dysfunctional approach or avoidance tendencies, an AAT-training&#xD;
      has been developed. In this training participants/patients learn to either avoid or approach&#xD;
      disease-specific objects. Smokers, for instance, learn to avoid smoking-related pictures by&#xD;
      pushing or swiping the image away. It has been shown that these trainings can lower cigarette&#xD;
      consumption among current smokers (Machulska, Zlomuzica, Rinck, Assian, &amp; Margraf, 2016). The&#xD;
      aim of the current study is to test whether the avoidance gesture is as important as&#xD;
      suggested by the AAT's name or whether inhibiting the urge to approach smoking-related&#xD;
      content might be enough to bring about the effect. Furthermore, possible changes in general&#xD;
      and domain-specific (i.e. smoking-related) inhibition capacity, that might mediate the&#xD;
      effect, will be assessed. Another focus of study will be on functional as well as structural&#xD;
      neuronal changes, emerging as a consequence of the AAT-training.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The approach and avoidance task (AAT) has turned out as both a promising diagnostic tool as&#xD;
      well as treatment add-on in psychological science. The AAT constitutes one form of cognitive&#xD;
      bias modification (CBM), which has been shown to be particularly effective in the field of&#xD;
      behavioural addictions (Eberl et al., 2013; Wiers, Eberl, Rinck, Becker, &amp; Lindenmeyer,&#xD;
      2011). The general logic underlying the AAT is to carry out actions that are either&#xD;
      compatible or incompatible with an individual's action tendencies. For instance, nicotine&#xD;
      addicted individuals tend to approach tobacco-related stimuli faster than control pictures,&#xD;
      when they are instructed to react upon the format of a picture and not to its' content. This&#xD;
      tendency of comparatively faster approaching and slower avoiding tobacco-related content has&#xD;
      been termed an approach bias nicotine/tobacco. The AAT as a therapeutic tool tries to&#xD;
      counteract or at least to attenuate approach or avoidance biases by instructing patients to&#xD;
      carry out approach or avoidance gestures that are in conflict with an individual's acquired&#xD;
      action tendencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whereas the general effectiveness of the AAT as a clinical intervention has been demonstrated&#xD;
      several times, little is known about possible mechanisms that might subserve these effects.&#xD;
      Therefore, the current study is dedicated to shed some light on one such potential mechanism,&#xD;
      i.e. the role of the avoidance gesture within the alcohol-AAT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As already suggested by the name of the AAT, the avoidance gesture seems to be a key&#xD;
      ingredient in bringing about therapeutic effects. However, recent empirical evidence has&#xD;
      brought about some interesting findings, giving rise to an alternative explanation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study by Kühn et al. (2017), contrary to common-held beliefs, indicated that inhibition&#xD;
      capacity can be trained. Inhibition, in turn, consistently has been linked to psychopathology&#xD;
      and all kinds of behavioural addictions (Smith, Mattick, Jamadar, &amp; Iredale, 2014). The game&#xD;
      by Kühn et al. (2017), used to train inhibition, resembled the AAT in several ways, e.g.&#xD;
      certain stimuli appearing on a treadmill had to be collected by swiping towards oneself and&#xD;
      others had to be ignored and the objects slowly disappeared. The latter element contrasts&#xD;
      with the AAT, since the ignored objects don't have to be pushed away. However, it resembles&#xD;
      the AAT in the sense that in both cases stimuli slowly fade out of the screen and eventually&#xD;
      disappear. These parallel let to the assumption that a new form of the alcohol AAT training&#xD;
      might be equally effective in lowering relapse rates among alcoholic patients. More&#xD;
      precisely, within the newly conceptualized AAT training, patients are instructed to inhibit&#xD;
      the urge to respond in response to alcohol-related content and to observe the stimuli fading&#xD;
      out of the screen. In contrast to the classical AAT training, this zooming out of alcoholic&#xD;
      stimuli is not conditional on the avoidance gesture, i.e. swiping/pushing away the stimulus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that compared to a control group, in which tobacco and control stimuli&#xD;
      have to be swiped to the left and right, both the classical AAT-and the inhibition group will&#xD;
      be more successful in stopping or reducing smoking. The intervention includes a training&#xD;
      period of four weeks. No intergroup differences in terms of smoking cessation and&#xD;
      tobacco-related approach bias are expected for the classical AAT group and the inhibition&#xD;
      group after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, it will be explored whether inhibition capacity changes as a result of the&#xD;
      intervention, the assumption being that inhibition capacity increases for both experimental&#xD;
      groups, whereas no changes are expected for the control group. An interesting question&#xD;
      concerns the domain-specificity of potential effects. In other words, does inhibition&#xD;
      capacity improve only for the to be trained domain (i.e. tobacco) or does the general&#xD;
      inhibition capacity improve, irrespective of the to be trained domain? Predictions on this&#xD;
      issue are not straightforward, but it is assumed that both the general and domain-specific&#xD;
      inhibition capacity improve for the experimental groups, when compared to the control group.&#xD;
      Slightly more pronounced effects are expected for the domain-specific task, since the&#xD;
      training calls for comparable skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses concerning experimental changes in brain structure are hard to make, as, to the&#xD;
      best of our knowledge, no research has been done on this topic up until now. Therefore,&#xD;
      whole-brain analyses will be run on all voxels of the brain in order to explore any&#xD;
      experimental changes both on the within and between subject level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same goes for functional changes in a Stop Signal Task (SST) and a cue reactivity&#xD;
      paradigm. It will be explored whether the classical AAT group and the inhibition group show&#xD;
      less reward-related activity in response to addiction-related stimuli than participants in&#xD;
      the control group. Furthermore, it will be explored whether brain regions commonly associated&#xD;
      with inhibition capacity show more activity in response to smoking-related stimuli, since&#xD;
      this has been learned throughout the training period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All secondary outcome measures (e.g. smoking-related questionnaires, Beck's Depression&#xD;
      Inventory, Barratt's Impulsivity Scale, AUDIT) assess whether the experimental manipulations&#xD;
      lead to a reduction in psychopathological symptoms. Therefore, both experimental groups are&#xD;
      expected to show post-interventional declines in nicotine-dependence measures and other&#xD;
      measures associated with dependence, such as mental well-being and impulsivity. In contrast,&#xD;
      no changes across time are expected for the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to test prior mentioned hypotheses, a randomized controlled trial will be conducted.&#xD;
      Each of the three groups (inhibition group, classical AAT group, and control group) will&#xD;
      consist out of 25 mentally healthy participants, who just stopped smoking or just start an&#xD;
      attempt to quit smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total the study consists out of three points of measurement. After the baseline testing,&#xD;
      which assesses participants' approach bias for tobacco, their tobacco history, tobacco&#xD;
      consumption within the last months, a multitude of smoking-related questionnaires (see&#xD;
      secondary outcome measures), the two inhibition tasks, brain structure and brain function,&#xD;
      participants are provided with a tablet on which the AAT app is installed. The participants&#xD;
      are asked to train with the app for at least 15 minutes daily within a four-week period.&#xD;
      Following this training, the second point of measurement will take place. The general&#xD;
      procedure is identical to the first point of measurement. Another four weeks later, the third&#xD;
      point of measurement marks the end of the study. Once again, the measures are the same except&#xD;
      for the fact that no MRI scan is realized on this last occasion, since the study is primarily&#xD;
      interested in post-interventional brain changes.&#xD;
