    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of adavosertib when given together&#xD;
      with olaparib in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other places in the&#xD;
      body (advanced) with selected mutations. Adavosertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. PARPs are proteins that help repair DNA&#xD;
      mutations. PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, can keep PARP from working, so tumor cells&#xD;
      can't repair themselves, and they may stop growing. Giving olaparib and adavosertib one after&#xD;
      the other may shrink or stabilize advanced solid tumors as successfully as using them&#xD;
      together, with fewer side effects.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of olaparib in sequential treatment with&#xD;
      adavosertib (AZD1775).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To establish the maximum tolerated dose/recommended phase 2 dose (MTD/RP2D) of this&#xD;
      sequential schedule in patients with advanced solid tumors in a post-poly adenosine&#xD;
      diphosphate (ADP) ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the safety and toxicity profile of the sequential treatment of olaparib and&#xD;
      AZD1775 in a post-PARPi population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess putative predictive biomarkers of response and resistance to the sequential&#xD;
      treatment of olaparib and AZD1775 in a post-PARPi population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate a novel experimental trial design involving sequential dosing of olaparib and&#xD;
      AZD1775 in a post-PARPi population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To observe and record anti-tumor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of adavosertib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-5 and 15-19 of each cycle&#xD;
      and adavosertib PO once daily (QD) on days 8-12 and 22-26 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every&#xD;
      28 days for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3-6&#xD;
      months for up to 2 years.&#xD;

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected (HIV1/2 antibody-positive) patients may&#xD;
             participate if they meet all the following eligibility requirements:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  They must be on an anti-retroviral regimen with evidence of at least two&#xD;
                  undetectable viral loads within the past 6 months on this same regimen; the most&#xD;
                  recent undetectable viral load must be within the past 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  They must have a CD4 count &gt;= 250 cells/uL over the past 6 months on this same&#xD;
                  anti-retroviral regimen and must not have had a CD4 count &lt; 200 cells/ul over the&#xD;
                  past 2 years, unless it was deemed related to the cancer and/or&#xD;
                  chemotherapy-induced bone marrow suppression. For patients who have received&#xD;
                  chemotherapy in the past 6 months, a CD4 count &lt; 250 cells/ul during chemotherapy&#xD;
                  is permitted as long as viral loads were undetectable during this same&#xD;
                  chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  They must have an undetectable viral load and a CD4 count &gt;= 250 cells/uL within&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  If CD4 count drops to less than 200 cells/ul while on study, initiate viral&#xD;
                       load test. If viral load proves undetectable at this time, continue CD4 and&#xD;
                       viral load checks every 8 weeks (q8w). If 2 consecutive viral load tests are&#xD;
                       undetectable, revert to q12w testing for CD4 and viral load testing&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  If an opportunistic infection occurs with a CD4 count of &lt; 200 cells/ul,&#xD;

             presence of hepatitis B core antibody and absence of HBsAg) are eligible. Active HBV&#xD;
             is defined by a known positive HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) result. Patients positive&#xD;
             for hepatitis C virus (HBC) antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
             (PCR) is negative for HCV RNA. Patients with known active HBV or HBC infection are&#xD;
             ineligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if follow-up brain imaging after&#xD;
             central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy shows no evidence of progression within&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with new or progressive brain metastases (active brain metastases) or&#xD;
             leptomeningeal disease are eligible if the treating physician determines that&#xD;

             [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvate transaminase [SGPT])&#xD;
             =&lt; 2.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN) (within 7 days of study drugs initiation), unless&#xD;
             liver metastases are present in which case they must be =&lt; 5 X ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum bilirubin within normal limits (WNL) (within 7 days of study drugs initiation)&#xD;

             check creatinine clearance (CrCl) with cut off &gt;= 51 mL/min as calculated by the&#xD;
             Cockcroft-Gault method or based on a 24-hour urine test (confirmation of creatinine&#xD;
             clearance is only required when serum creatinine is &gt; 1.5 X institutional ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of AZD1775 and olaparib on the developing human fetus are either unclear&#xD;
             or are known to be teratogenic, women of childbearing potential and their partners,&#xD;
             who are sexually active, must agree to the use of TWO highly effective forms of&#xD;
             contraception in combination. This should be started from the signing of the informed&#xD;
             consent and continue throughout the period of taking study treatment and for at least&#xD;
             1 month after last dose of study drug(s), or they must totally/truly abstain from any&#xD;
             form of sexual intercourse. Male patients must use a condom during treatment and for 3&#xD;
             months after the last dose of study drug when having sexual intercourse with a&#xD;
             pregnant woman or with a woman of childbearing potential. Female partners of male&#xD;
             patients should also use a highly effective form of contraception if they are of&#xD;
             childbearing potential. Male patients should not donate sperm throughout the period of&#xD;
             taking study drugs and for 3 months following the last dose of study drugs.&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  Total/True abstinence: When the patient refrains from any form of sexual&#xD;
                       intercourse and this is in line with their usual and/or preferred lifestyle;&#xD;
                       this must continue for the total duration of the trial and for at least 1&#xD;
                       month after the last dose of study drug for women of child bearing&#xD;
                       potential. For male patients, 3 months after last dose. (Periodic abstinence&#xD;
                       [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods, or&#xD;
                       declaration of abstinence solely for the duration of a trial] and withdrawal&#xD;
                       are not acceptable methods of contraception.)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Vasectomized sexual partner PLUS male condom. With participant assurance&#xD;
                       that partner received post-vasectomy confirmation of azoospermia&#xD;

                       highly efficacious progesterone based pill&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Hormonal shot or injection (e.g., Depo-Provera) PLUS male condom&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Etonogestrel implants (e.g., Implanon, Norplant) PLUS male condom&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Norelgestromin / ethinyl estradiol (EE) transdermal system PLUS male condom&#xD;

                    -  In the case of use of oral contraception, women should be stable on the same&#xD;
                       pill before taking study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Note: oral contraceptives are allowed but should be used in conjunction with&#xD;
                       a barrier method of contraception due to unknown effect of drug-drug&#xD;
                       interaction. Women are considered post-menopausal and not of childbearing&#xD;
                       potential if they have had 12 or more months of natural (spontaneous)&#xD;
                       amenorrhea following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatment with an&#xD;
                       appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor&#xD;
                       symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without&#xD;
                       hysterectomy). In the case of oophorectomy alone, she will be considered not&#xD;
                       of childbearing potential only when her reproductive status has been&#xD;
                       confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male patients will be advised to arrange for the freezing of sperm samples prior to&#xD;
             the start of the study should they wish to father children while on study drugs or&#xD;
             during the 3 months after stopping study drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female patient &gt;= 18 years of age. Because no dosing or adverse event data are&#xD;
             currently available on the use of AZD1775 in combination with olaparib in patients &lt;&#xD;
             18 years of age, children are excluded from this study, but will be eligible for&#xD;

             the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant use of CYP3A inducers/inhibitors:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Concomitant use of known strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole,&#xD;
                  telithromycin, clarithromycin, protease inhibitors boosted with ritonavir or&#xD;
                  cobicistat, indinavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) or&#xD;
                  moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, diltiazem,&#xD;
                  fluconazole, verapamil). The required washout period prior to starting olaparib&#xD;
                  is 2 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Concomitant use of known strong (e.g., phenobarbital, enzalutamide, phenytoin,&#xD;
                  rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine, carbamazepine, nevirapine and St John's Wort)&#xD;
                  or moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g., bosentan, efavirenz, modafinil). The required&#xD;
                  washout period prior to starting study treatment is 5 weeks for enzalutamide or&#xD;
                  phenobarbital and 3 weeks for other agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgical procedures =&lt; 28 days of beginning study treatment, or minor surgical&#xD;
             procedures =&lt; 7 days. Patients must have recovered from any of the effects of any&#xD;
             major surgery. No waiting period required following port-a-cath placement or other&#xD;
             central venous access placement&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known malignant central nervous system (CNS) disease other than neurologically stable,&#xD;
             treated brain metastases - defined as metastasis having no evidence of progression or&#xD;
             hemorrhage for at least 2 weeks after treatment (including brain radiotherapy). Must&#xD;
             be off any systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of brain metastases for at least&#xD;
             14 days prior to enrollment. Subjects with brain metastases must have completed&#xD;
             treatment, either surgery or radiation, and be stable for at least 28 days off steroid&#xD;
             prior to screening. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrating there is no&#xD;
             current evidence or progressive brain metastases is required in subjects with previous&#xD;
             brain metastasis. Patients with breast tissue expanders may have brain computed&#xD;
             tomography (CT) for assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with either previous or current myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myeloid&#xD;
             leukemia (AML) or features suggestive of MDS/AML (e.g., persistent anemia or other&#xD;
             blood dyscrasias) are excluded because olaparib and AZD1775 are agents with the&#xD;
             potential to induce MDS/AML&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AZD1775 should not be given to patients who have a history of Torsades de pointes&#xD;
             (TdP) unless all risk factors that contributed to TdP have been corrected&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any of the following cardiac diseases currently or within the last 6 months:&#xD;

               -  Unstable angina pectoris&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Acute myocardial infarction&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Congestive heart failure &gt;= class 2 (as defined by New York Heart Association&#xD;
                  [NYHA])&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Conduction abnormality not controlled with pacemaker or medication&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Significant ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias (patients with chronic&#xD;
                  rate-controlled atrial fibrillation in the absence of other cardiac abnormalities&#xD;
                  are eligible)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a mean resting corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt;= 480 msec at study&#xD;
             entry, as calculated by the Frederica formula (QTcF) by institutional standards&#xD;
             obtained from an electrocardiogram (ECG) or congenital long QT syndrome. (Note: if one&#xD;
             ECG demonstrates a QTcF &gt; 480 msec, then a mean QTcF of =&lt; 480 msec obtained from 3&#xD;
             ECGs 2-5 minutes apart is required at study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients considered a poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical&#xD;
             disorder, non-malignant systemic disease or active, uncontrolled infection. Examples&#xD;
             include, but are not limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 3&#xD;
             months) myocardial infarction, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, unstable spinal&#xD;
             cord compression, superior vena cava syndrome, extensive interstitial bilateral lung&#xD;
             disease on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan or any psychiatric disorder&#xD;
             that prohibits obtaining informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurren&#xD;
