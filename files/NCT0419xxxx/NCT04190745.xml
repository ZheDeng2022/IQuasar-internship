  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preclinical studies have shown that Toripalimab and Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab have similar&#xD;
      safety but better in vivo efficacy than target monoclonal antibody candidates with different&#xD;
      sequence characteristics.In addition, apatinib mesylate is a small-molecule drug that can&#xD;
      target VEGFR and is itself a powerful therapeutic drug for gastric cancer, so we designed a&#xD;
      clinical trial of apatinib combined with toripalimab monoclonal antibody.The study focused on&#xD;
      12 month OS rate, progression-free survival (PFS), clinical objective response rate (ORR),&#xD;
      and drug safety.The study was an open, multicenter, randomized controlled clinical trial with&#xD;
      a 1:1 distribution of trial and control groups.It is expected that 58 people will be included&#xD;
      in the experimental group and 58 people in the control group.&#xD;
