  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are a wide range of significant epidemiological, clinical, and operative predictors for&#xD;
      the development of post-CABG AF including older age, female gender, large LA diameter, higher&#xD;
      CHA2DS2-VASc score, valve replacement and postoperative inotropic support. Nevertheless,&#xD;
      further large-scale studies are still needed to confirm our findings&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We included patients undergoing isolated CABG or CABG with (Aortic and / or Mitral) valve&#xD;
      replacement with an age group between 18 and 70 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients diagnosed preoperatively with AF or have history of AF, patients with history of&#xD;
      existing pre-operative rhythm other than normal sinus rhythm (NSR), patients with impaired&#xD;
      systolic function (Ejection fraction (EF) &lt; 30%), patients with end stage renal disease&#xD;
      (ESRD) on hemodialysis and patients who refused to participate in the study were excluded&#xD;
      from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Sampling: Using PASS program, setting alpha error at 5% and power 80%.&#xD;
      Results from previous study Ducceschi et al. (6) showed that left atrial (LA) diameter was an&#xD;
      independent factor affecting AF post CABG. Based on this, the needed sample was 123 cases&#xD;
      undergoing CABG, including at least 24 patients with dilated LA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All individuals were monitored for AF during the postoperative ICU stay with continuous ECG&#xD;
      (5-leads) monitor, daily 12-lead ECG recording to confirm an episode of AF. AF was considered&#xD;
      if P wave was absent before the QRS complex together with irregular ventricular rhythm on the&#xD;
      rhythm strips.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only AF episodes lasting &gt; 5 minutes were counted. In the present study, the following data,&#xD;
      as potential predictors of POAF, was collected from every eligible participant; age, sex,&#xD;
      smoking and left atrial (LA) diameter based on formal preoperative Trans-thoracic&#xD;
      Echocardiography. Serum potassium (K+) level was routinely measured postoperatively on ICU&#xD;
      admission and every 2 hours and on demand (if arrhythmia occurs or suspected abnormal&#xD;
      potassium level). It was recorded for statistical analysis on admission and every 12 hours&#xD;
      and on demand until the patient was discharged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum Magnesium (Mg++) level was measured routinely measured postoperatively on ICU admission&#xD;
      and every 24 hours and on demand (if arrhythmia occurs or suspected abnormal magnesium&#xD;
      level). It was recorded for statistical study on admission and every 24 hours and on demand&#xD;
      until the patient was discharged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other parameters such as valve replacement (Aortic and/or Mitral) during the same operative&#xD;
      setting, CHA2DS2-VASc score (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension [blood pressure &gt;140/90&#xD;
      mm Hg or treated hypertension on medication], Age â‰¥75 years, Diabetes mellitus, prior Stroke&#xD;
      or transient ischemic attack or thromboembolism, vascular disease, Age 65 to 74 years, Sex&#xD;
      category [female sex] ), and post-operative inotropic support usage were recorded.&#xD;
