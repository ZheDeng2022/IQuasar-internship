      The purpose of the study is to evaluate if postoperative antibiotic use in patients with&#xD;
      mandible trauma reduce the risk of postoperative infections and does the benefit differ based&#xD;
      on severity, soft tissue loss, other concomitant injuries, and medical problems&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of antibiotics postoperatively in&#xD;
      non-infected mandible fractures compared to the lack of postoperative antibiotics in the same&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first outcome measure is infection. Evidence of infection includes persistent swelling,&#xD;
      fever, recurrent swelling, erythema, and purulent discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second outcome measure is no infection. Absence of persistent swelling, fever, recurrent&#xD;
      swelling, erythema, and purulent discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures will be assessed on follow-up visits: post op week 1, post op week 3, and&#xD;
      post op week 6-8. Latest follow-up is up to 8 weeks. If the subject presents with any of the&#xD;
      above mentioned symptoms during the 8 week post-op period, the subject will be considered&#xD;
      positive for infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective randomized trial: Control group will not receive any postoperative antibiotics&#xD;
      other than what is accepted as preoperative prophylactic antibiotics as per current standards&#xD;
      of care. Trial groups will receive a single post-operative dose administration of Unasyn 3g&#xD;
      or Clindamycin 600mg (for penicillin allergies), then the patients in the trial group will be&#xD;
      switched to oral Augmentin 875mg twice a day for 7 days (Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid&#xD;
      which is clinically interchangeable with Unasyn), or oral Clindamycin 150mg to 300mg four&#xD;
      times a day for 7 days (for penicillin allergies). If the patient is discharged home prior to&#xD;
      completing 7 days of oral antibiotic therapy, patient will receive prescription to finish the&#xD;
      remaining doses of antibiotics for a total period of 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will follow up post op week 1, post op week 3, and post op week 6-8. Latest&#xD;
      follow-up is up to 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored for any complications, including reaction to IV and oral&#xD;
      antibiotics. Patient will assessed after the one-time post-op IV antibiotic dose and during&#xD;
      their follow-up visits at weeks 1, 3, and 6-8.&#xD;
