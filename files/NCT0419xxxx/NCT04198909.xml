  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acoustic overexposure can induced temporary or hearing loss. Usually hearing loss is&#xD;
      associated with cochlear cell damages. Recently, a new pathological entity was described and&#xD;
      called &quot;hidden hearing loss&quot;. In animal model, the histopathology revealed a selective&#xD;
      reduction in the number of auditory fibers, resulting in a decrease in the amplitude of wave&#xD;
      I of the auditory brainstem response. Electrocochleography (Ecog) is a method for recording&#xD;
      the electrical potentials of the cochlea (e.g. wave I). In clinical routine, Ecog is&#xD;
      performed invasively with sedation or local anesthesia. Actually, a non invasive approach&#xD;
      could be perform but it seems necessary to optimize this method and to define reference&#xD;
      values in healthy volunteers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sound overexposure is a major cause of hearing disorders. The installation of hearing&#xD;
      disorders can be temporary or permanent. Most of the time the investigators see a rise in&#xD;
      hearing thresholds that can be accompanied by tinnitus. However, sometimes-hearing disorders&#xD;
      aren't characterized by higher auditory threshold but by a complaint of understanding in&#xD;
      noise. Two explanation are the either possible with a lesion at the peripheral level (sensory&#xD;
      organ) or central lesion (auditory pathways). Peripheral damage is easily analysed by&#xD;
      conventional tests such as the audiogram. Concerning the central lesions, through to the&#xD;
      Electrocochleography, one sees a diminution of the wave I which corresponds to the nerve&#xD;
      fiber injury. The wave I can more easily be analysed by the Electrocochleography method. This&#xD;
      technique previously used an electrode deposited trans-tympanically in contact with the&#xD;
      sensory organ. But, the evolution of a non-invasive technique is now available. However,&#xD;
      several assemblies of the electrode are then possible without knowing the impact of these on&#xD;
      the morphology of the wave I. Moreover, no normative values are also referenced in the&#xD;
      literature on the population without hearing problems. It's in this context that clinical&#xD;
      study is carried out in order to optimize the technique on the assembly of the electrode and&#xD;
      the acoustic stimulation delivered. After this analyses and obtaining an optimal technique&#xD;
      it's envisaged to study the morphology of the wave I in healthy volunteers aged 18-25 years.&#xD;
      A pre-inclusion visit will verify the volunteers doesn't have a hearing disorders through a&#xD;
      questionnaire, otoscopy, tympanometry and audiometry. Then two steps will be realized. The&#xD;
      first is to evaluate the morphology of wave I according to assembly of electrode and acoustic&#xD;
      stimulation delivered (machine calibration or calibration in the external auditory canal).&#xD;
      The second step will provide normative values for people 18-25 years old who aren't&#xD;
      hearing-impaired. Volunteers will have the choice to participate in one or both stages. The&#xD;
      aim is to obtain wave I reference values for Electrocochleography technique. The secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to analyse the impact of the assembly of the electrode and the adaptation of&#xD;
      the acoustic stimulation presented.&#xD;
