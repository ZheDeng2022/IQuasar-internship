  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic low back pain may be associated with active discopathy. This subset of individuals&#xD;
      are defined by a clinical and radiological syndrome with specific MRI signals, known as MODIC&#xD;
      changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three types (I, II and III) of MODIC changes are described. Type I refers to the inflammatory&#xD;
      reaction regarding the intervertebral-disc subchondral bone and adjacent vertebral-endplate&#xD;
      subchondral bone. The natural evolution of this active discopathy will lead to sclerosis&#xD;
      (type III) supposedly less painful. So far the underlying mechanism remains unclear and&#xD;
      debated (mechanical, local infection, genetic). In the absence of international guidelines on&#xD;
      the management on chronic low back pain with MC type 1, different therapeutic strategies have&#xD;
      been described. The main goal is to accelerate the transition to MC type 2, which is&#xD;
      supposedly less painful. The estimated time to expect a transition from type 1 to type 2 is&#xD;
      at least 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanical hypothesis found its origin in the Modic et al. initial study, linking Modic&#xD;
      changes (MC) types 1 and 2 to degenerative disc disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Histological analysis of patient suffering from active discopathy has shown signs of&#xD;
      micro fractures regarding vertebral endplates. The local inflammatory reaction may be part of&#xD;
      a repair process following the micro fracture. Based on this mechanical explanation an&#xD;
      orthopaedic treatment with a lumbar brace may accelerate the healing, thus the transition&#xD;
      from modic I to type II. This approach has been studied in a retrospective analysis on 62&#xD;
      patients suffering from active discopathy (modic type I) who were prescribed a custom lumbar&#xD;
      rigid brace for 3 months, at endpoint 80% of the patients treated described a reduction of at&#xD;
      least 30% of their initial pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to confirm the previous hypothesis, that lumbar immobilisation by custom&#xD;
      rigid brace can reduce the pain after being worn for 3 months. Secondary objective will be to&#xD;
      assess the pain reduction at 6 months along with functional outcome, fears and beliefs, mood&#xD;
      and medical costs at short (3 months) and mid (6months) term.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a 2 parallel group multicentre randomised controlled trial. Patients will&#xD;
      undergo 3 consultations with the physician, based on the usual follow up for this pathology.&#xD;
      During the first consultation the physician will check the inclusion criteria, medical&#xD;
      history, clinical data relative to the different outcomes, and prescribe optimizated pain&#xD;
      killers and deliver information about self care and physical activity. Patient reported&#xD;
      outcome measures will be assessed through self answering questionnaires with the help of a&#xD;
      research assistant if necessary. After randomisation the prosthetist will take the&#xD;
      measurement to conceive the custom brace. Patients will then be re-examined during a 2nd&#xD;
      consultation 3 month later to assess the main outcome (pain reduction) and other secondary&#xD;
      outcome (proms). A third consultation will be organised 6 months later for secondary outcome&#xD;
      (pain reduction and proms).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>Average change from baseline in the pain intensity measured on a Visual Analogical Scale (VAS) Visual analog scale (VAS) and its corresponding visual analog pain scale, is a psychometric scale that is generally used to conduct pain scale surveys to understand varying degrees of pain or discomfort experienced by a patient. The score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) on the 10-cm line between the &quot;no pain&quot; anchor and the patient's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-100. A higher score indicates greater pain intensity. The following cut points on the pain VAS have been recommended: no pain (0-4 mm), mild pain(5-44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75-100 mm)</description>

    <measure>The Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire measures in patients with low back pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>The Roland-Morris Questionnaire is a self-administered disability measure in which greater levels of disability are reflected by higher numbers on a 24-point scale. The RMQ has been shown to yield reliable measurements, which are valid for inferring the level of disability, and to be sensitive to change over time for groups of patients with low back pain. Roland and Morris did not provide descriptions of the varying degrees of disability (eg, 40%-60% is severe disability). Clinical improvement over time can be graded based on the analysis of serial questionnaire scores. If, for example, at the beginning of treatment, a patient's score was 12 and, at the conclusion of treatment, their score was 2 (10 points of improvement), we would calculate an 83% (10/12 x 100) improvement</description>

    <measure>The fears and beliefs measured by questionnaire FABQ</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>The FABQ can help predict those that have a high pain avoidance behavior. Clinically, these people may need to be supervised more than those that confront their pain. The FABQ contains 2 scales: a work scale (FABQ-W) composed of 7 items and a physical activity scale (FABQ-PA) composed of 4 items. The two scales are scored separately. Higher FABQ scores indicate elevated fear-avoidance beliefs. &quot;FABQ-W&quot; has a point score that ranges from 0-42 points. It can be calculated as follows: (Total points for items 6, 7, 9, 10 11, 12 and 15) = Work scale score. &quot;FABQ-PA&quot; can range from 0-24 points. Scores are calculated as follows: (Total points for items 2, 3, 4 and 5) = Physical activity scale score.</description>

    <description>patients will receive their brace 2 weeks after the first consultation (usual delay to conceive and deliver the brace), they will be asked to wear the brace all day and will be allowed to redraw it at night. Brace must be worn for 3 months. A specific eduction on how to wear the brace will also be delivered. A thermal sensor chip will be placed in the brace to assess the observance. No physiotherapy will be prescribed during this period. Patient will attend to 3 consultations, day 0, 3 months and finally at 6 months later. These three consultations are part of usual care.</description>
