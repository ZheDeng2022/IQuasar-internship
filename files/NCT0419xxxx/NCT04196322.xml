      Background: Hyperglycemia is encountered in 20% to 40% of acute stroke patients, with or&#xD;
      without a pre-morbid diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Hyperglycemia is a risk factor for&#xD;
      infarct expansion and poor outcome through the first 72 hours of onset in both diabetics and&#xD;
      non-diabetics patients. This study was done to evaluate the glycemic status after acute&#xD;
      ischemic stroke and assess its rule in influencing stroke outcome as regards the duration of&#xD;
      hospital stay, motor deficit and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This retrospective study was conducted in Elzaiton specialized hospital from June&#xD;
      2016 to June 2017on 80 patients after approval of local medical ethical committee. Patients&#xD;
      with acute ischemic stroke without other major comorbidities within 24 hours of onset of&#xD;
      symptoms were included and divided into two groups, controlled group (Random blood suger not&#xD;
      more than 150 mg/dl) and uncontrolled group ( Random blood suger more than 150 mg/dl). All&#xD;
      patients were evaluated for GCS as a primary outcome and for hemorrhagic transformation,&#xD;
      hospital stay duration, mechanical ventilation, need for vasopressors,hospital stay and&#xD;
      mortality as secondary outcomes.&#xD;

      Patients and Methods This study was prospective study conducted in Elzaiton specialized&#xD;
      hospital and Ain Shams University from june2016 to June 2017on 80 patients after approval of&#xD;
      local medical ethical committee&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients was subjected to the following&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Full clinical history â€¦age, sex, weight and medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. GCS and motor deficit&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Random blood glucose level at admission and 4-6 times daily during hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. HbA1c on admission&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Hemodynamic monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Duration of hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Thirty day mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Other laboratory investigation to rule out other similar cause&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Follow up hemorrhagic transformation Study tools: Patients with acute ischemic stroke&#xD;
           without other major comorbidities within 24 hours of onset of symptoms will be&#xD;
           evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On ICU admission the random blood sugar was recorded and categorized to less than 150mg/dl&#xD;
      (accepted) and more than 150mg/dl(not controlled). Also serial Random blood sugar daily was&#xD;
      recorded and categorized to accepted or good control if less than 150mg/dl and not controlled&#xD;
      if more than 150mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were divided into 2 groups Patients with accepted random blood sugar at admission&#xD;
      and controlled blood sugar during hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with increased random blood sugar at admission and poor blood sugar control during&#xD;
      hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data were collected and patients were observed as regards duration of hospital&#xD;
      stay,hemorrhagic transformation, hospital stay duration and 30-days mortality&#xD;
