      Project STAR aims to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of a CBT-I&#xD;
      supplement to outpatient alcohol and substance use treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among those who receive treatment for alcohol use disorder (AUD), one in three relapses to&#xD;
      problematic drinking within one year of treatment. Thus, additional treatment strategies are&#xD;
      needed. Notably, up to 74% of individuals seeking treatment for AUD report co-occurring&#xD;
      symptoms of insomnia, while 85% of those seeking SUD treatment report insomnia symptoms.&#xD;
      Given the negative impact of insomnia on attention and emotion regulation, insomnia symptoms&#xD;
      may decrease patients' abilities to attend to treatment for substance use and manage negative&#xD;
      emotions that lead to craving and relapse. This project aims to examine the feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability, and initial efficacy of a CBT-I supplement to substance use treatment. Forty&#xD;
      adults who meet diagnostic criteria for AUD or SUD and Insomnia Disorder will receive&#xD;
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I). In order to generate hypotheses regarding&#xD;
      the efficacy of CBT-I for individuals who are and are not engaged in substance use treatment,&#xD;
      we aim to recruit 20 participants who are engaged in substance use treatment through the&#xD;
      community at baseline and 20 participants who are not. Outcomes will be assessed at the end&#xD;
      of the active intervention period (6 weeks) and at 6 weeks post-intervention&#xD;

    <description>Assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI); ISI will be used as a 7-item measure of insomnia severity in the past two weeks. Items assess difficulty falling or staying asleep, satisfaction with current sleep pattern, interference with daily functioning, the extent to which others notice their sleep problems, and worry/distress related to sleep problems. Response options range from 0 (not at all worried) to 4 (very much worried), with possible total scores ranging from 0 to 28. Participants scoring 10 or higher will be classified as screening positive for insomnia (Morin et al., 2011).114 Notably, self-report is the recommended method of assessment for symptoms of insomnia in adults (Schutte-Rodin et al., 2008).</description>
