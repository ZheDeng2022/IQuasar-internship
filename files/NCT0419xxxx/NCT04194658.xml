  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background and Rationale Abortion accounts for about 8% of maternal mortality worldwide.&#xD;
      Surgical intervention is the definitive treatment for abortion but it is invasive.&#xD;
      Misoprostol, a PG E1 analogue, is exten¬sively used for induction of abortion with success&#xD;
      rate less than 90%. Estrogen is important in the maintenance of pregnancy &amp; aromatase enzyme&#xD;
      is essential for its production. Letrozole is an aromatase inhibitor. So we assume that&#xD;
      suppression of serum estradiol by letrozole will facilitate termination of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the effect of a combination of letrozole with misoprostol versus misoprostol alone&#xD;
      in successful induction of medical abortion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population &amp; Sample size 150 women will be recruited. Women included will be &gt; 18 years&#xD;
      with singleton pregnancy of gestational age ≤ 20 weeks having missed abortion. They will be&#xD;
      excluded if they have prior CS, twin pregnancy, allergy to letrozole or liver problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design :&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled trial in which patients will be divided into 2 groups; case group &amp;&#xD;
      control group. Each group will contain 75 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case group will receive pretreatment letrozole 12.5 mg for 2 days while control group will&#xD;
      receive only misoprostol. Both groups will receive misoprostol in a dosage according to the&#xD;
      ACOG guidelines based on gestational age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible Risk (s) to study population :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major risks (Sepsis, considerable vaginal bleeding leading to hemodynamic instability or&#xD;
      necessitating blood transfusion). Minor risks (Nausea, diarrhea, headache, weakness, hot&#xD;
      flushes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome parameter (s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Successful medical abortion i.e. complete abortion with no need for surgical curettage within&#xD;
      one week from the 1st dose of misoprostol.&#xD;

      Background and Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abortion management is one of the most important issues in gyne¬cology. According to the WHO&#xD;
      abortion accounts for about 8% of maternal mortality worldwide. The term 'abortion' has&#xD;
      become synonymous with induced abortion which is an intentional termination of pregnancy but&#xD;
      it also includes spontaneous abortion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induced abortion is thus one of the most commonly investigated topics in gynecology as means&#xD;
      to achieve safe abortion in order to reduce associated maternal morbidity &amp; mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abortion is defined as the termination of a pregnancy before the 20th week of pregnancy or&#xD;
      termina¬tion of pregnancy before the fetus weighing 500 g.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical intervention is the definitive treatment for abortion. However, it is invasive and&#xD;
      is not necessary for all females. Curettage may be avoided via expectation and medi¬cal&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Misoprostol, a synthetic analogue of natural prostaglandin E1, is exten-sively used for early&#xD;
      termination of pregnancy, therapeutic abortion, treatment of incomplete or missed abortion.&#xD;
      It results in abortion by ripening of the cervix &amp; stimulating the myometrium. Misoprostol&#xD;
      abortion rate is less than 90% in most studies and it has different side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progesterone is an essential component to establish and maintain pregnancy. It is responsible&#xD;
      for the transformation of the endometrium from a proliferative to a secretory state. In&#xD;
      addition, it has a role in relaxation of the uterus and prevention of cervical dilatation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estrogen is also important in the maintenance of pregnancy, although less evidence exists for&#xD;
      this. Aromatase enzyme is essential for its production via aromatization of androgens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During early pregnancy, the corpus luteum is the main source of estrogen and progesterone. It&#xD;
      is initially maintained by luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary, then after&#xD;
      implantation human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) from the trophoblastic cells takes over the&#xD;
      role of LH. This continues until the 7th week of pregnancy, when the placenta becomes the&#xD;
      main source of hormone production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacological agents that can reduce or block the actions of progesterone or estrogen may&#xD;
      therefore have a role in medical abortion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mifepristone, a progesterone antagonist, is widely used for medical abortion in countries&#xD;
      where it is available. The complete abortion rate of the sequential regimen using 200 mg of&#xD;
      oral mifepristone, followed 36-48 h later by a single dose of 800 µg of vaginal misoprostol,&#xD;
      is over 95% in pregnancies of less than 9 weeks' gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The widespread use of mifepristone is limited by the fact that it is expensive and not&#xD;
      available in many countries. Therefore a cheaper and easily available alternative needs to be&#xD;
      found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Letrozole, a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor, is most commonly used in hormone-sensitive&#xD;
      breast cancer. It reversibly and competitively bonds with the iron in cytochrome P450 and&#xD;
      prevents estrogen production by the enzyme aromatase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since estrogens are necessary for continuation of the pregnancy, we hypothesize that acute&#xD;
      suppression of the serum estradiol concentration by letrozole in human pregnancy would affect&#xD;
      the function of corpus and/or placenta thus facilitating termination of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the effect of a combination of letrozole with misoprostol versus misoprostol alone&#xD;
      in successful induction of medical abortion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled trial involving 150 women will be performed. They will be randomly&#xD;
      divided into 2 groups; each group contains 75 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case group will receive pretreatment letrozole 12.5 mg for 2 days while control group will&#xD;
      receive only misoprostol. Both groups will receive misoprostol in a dosage according to the&#xD;
      ACOG guidelines based on gestational age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study performed will be a phase 2 clinical trial. The study will be performed in&#xD;
      Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology Department, Kasr Al-Ainy Hospital, Cairo University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient &amp; Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was calculated to prevent type II error. According to Naghshineh and coworkers&#xD;
      (2015), complete abortion rates among case subjects was 76.7 % versus 42.6 % in the control&#xD;
      subjects. Calculation showed we need 51women in each arm to be able to reject with a&#xD;
      probability of 95% the null hypothesis that the rates for the case and control groups are&#xD;
      equal. The type I error probability associated with this test for the null hypothesis was&#xD;
      0.05. Additionally, to compensate for subjects declining to participate or lost to follow-up,&#xD;
      we recruited 75 women in each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The collected data will be tabulated and analyzed using appropriate&#xD;
      statistical tests.&#xD;
