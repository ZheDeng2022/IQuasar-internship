  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators decided to assess the prognostic value of NLRP3 inﬂammasome level in early&#xD;
      after heart valve replacement surgery and whether it was related to postoperative cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction. Study population included 90 subjects. Neuropsychological tests were&#xD;
      administrated one day before surgery and seven days after surgery. Before induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia, before the end of the operation, 7 days after the operation, peripheral venous&#xD;
      blood was sampled to measure IL-1B, IL-18 and NLRP3 inflammatory protein expression in&#xD;
      peripheral blood monocytes. Analyze the data and draw conclusions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      90 consecutive patients scheduled for mitral valve replacement or aortic valve replacement&#xD;
      under moderate hypothermic CPB gave written informed consent and were enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the operating room, patients received routine monitoring. Systemic arterial blood pressure&#xD;
      was measured via radial artery catheterization. After induction of anesthesia, a central&#xD;
      venous catheter was inserted for monitoring central venous pressure (CVP) and fluid&#xD;
      management. Baseline readings of hemodynamics were taken every 5 to 10 min after radial&#xD;
      artery cannulation was completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction of anesthesia was performed with target-controlled infusion of propofol. All&#xD;
      patients received an infused scheme of several steps that started from a target plasma&#xD;
      concentration (Cp) of 0.5 mg/mL that was increased stepwise by 0.5 mg/mL until the patient&#xD;
      fell asleep and maintain BIS at 40-60. The interval between each step was 3 min. After loss&#xD;
      of consciousness, cisatracurium (0.2 mg/kg) and fentanyl (10-15 mg/kg) were infused in all&#xD;
      groups. The trachea was intubated and the lungs were ventilated with oxygenenriched air&#xD;
      (fraction of inspired oxygen 0.6) to an end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure of 35 to 45&#xD;
      mmHg. The propofol target Cp was adjusted according to BIS. Intermittent IV boluses of&#xD;
      fentanyl (10-15 mg/kg) were administered according to blood pressure and heart rate (HR) at&#xD;
      the following time points: before the skin incision, before the onset of CPB, and after&#xD;
      separation from CPB, for a total dose of 40 to 50 mg/kg. All patients received infusion of&#xD;
      cisatracurium at 0.1 mg/kg/h throughout the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery was conducted on all patients via a standard median sternotomy approach. Porcine&#xD;
      heparin was administered at a dose of 300 IU/kg and supplemented when required to maintain an&#xD;
      activated coagulation time of at least 480 s during CPB. Heparin was neutralized with 1 mg of&#xD;
      protamine/100 IU of heparin administered after separation from CPB. Body temperature was&#xD;
      cooled to 30℃-32℃ on CPB (moderate hypothermia). All patients were treated with an&#xD;
      intermittent antegrade infusion of cooled high-potassium blood cardioplegia during continuous&#xD;
      aortic cross-clamping (ACC) using a nonpulsatile flow rate of 1.8 to 2.8 L/min/m2 and a&#xD;
      membrane oxygenator to keep the mixed venous saturation at more than 75% during CPB.&#xD;
      Phenylephrine (bolus, 20-100 mg) or epinephrine (0.1 mg/kg/min) or both were used to restore&#xD;
      systemic vascular resistance, and MAP was maintained at a target range of 60 to 80 mmHg.&#xD;
      Patients were warmed to a bladder temperature of 36.5℃ before separation from CPB, with the&#xD;
      highest temperature not exceeding 37℃. Blood remaining in the CPB circuit and from the&#xD;
      surgical field was collected in a cell-saving device. After centrifuging and washing, it was&#xD;
      infused to the patient within 4 hours after CPB. Hematocrit was maintained at more than 25%,&#xD;
      with the addition of blood as necessary. Insulin therapy was initiated during the surgery to&#xD;
      treat serum blood glucose levels higher than 150 mg/dL. Hemodynamic (pre- or post-CPB)&#xD;
      management aimed to keep MAP at 60 to 100 mmHg. Hypertension was treated with an additional&#xD;
      bolus dose of fentanyl (0.2-0.3 mg) or with nitroglycerin (0.1-0.5 mg/kg/min or with both).&#xD;
      Hypotension was treated with fluid intake (including crystalloids, colloids, and blood&#xD;
      products) or vasoactive drug administration (phenylephrine IV, 20-100 mg or concomitant use&#xD;
      of epinephrine, o 0.1 mg/min). The vasoactive drug dosage, fluid intake, and output (urine&#xD;
      and blood loss) were recorded when the surgery was finished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the surgeons began to close the skin, a 0.08 mg/kg bolus dose of midazolam was given&#xD;
      intravenously and the infusion of propofol was stopped. After the surgery, all patients were&#xD;
      admitted to the surgical intensive care unit (ICU). The patients were extubated when they&#xD;
      were able to sustain adequate spontaneous respiration and required minimal oxygen support, as&#xD;
      reflected by normal arterial blood gas levels. The patients then were discharged from the ICU&#xD;
      when they were hemodynamically stable with blood gas variables within the normal range and&#xD;
      when they did not need inotropic or oxygen support. The tracheal extubation time and the&#xD;
      length of the ICU stay were recorded. For all patients, hemodynamic measurements were made&#xD;
      and recorded at the following times: Before induction of anesthesia, before skin incision,&#xD;
      after sternotomy, at the cessation of CPB (CPB-cessation), and at 1 (Post-CPB 1 h), 2&#xD;
      (Post-CPB 2 h), and 4 (Post-CPB 4 h) hours after CPB. At pre-incision, CPB-cessation,&#xD;
      Post-CPB 2 h, and PostCPB 4 h, the radial arterial blood was sampled for blood gas analysis,&#xD;
      as well as blood glucose and lactic acid analyses. Before induction of anesthesia, at the end&#xD;
      of the operation, 7 days after the operation, peripheral venous blood was sampled to measure&#xD;
      IL-1B, IL-18 and NLRP3 inflammatory protein expression in peripheral blood monocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuropsychological tests were administrated one day before surgery and seven days after&#xD;
      surgery for all patients in a quiet place of the general wards. Neuropsychological tests&#xD;
      included seven tests with nine subscales. Specific tests used were as follows: MMSE, Trail&#xD;
      Making (A/B), Stroop Color- Word, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, WAIS Digit Symbol&#xD;
      Substitution Test, WAIS Digit Span, Verbal fluency test. Two psychologists carried out these&#xD;
      tests. During the study phase, testing was performed and scored in a standardized manner in&#xD;
      order to minimize inter-examiner difference. Repeat assessments for each patient were&#xD;
      conducted by the same examiner. Parallel forms of tests were used in a randomized manner in&#xD;
      sequential testing in order to minimize practice effect. Performance on each test was&#xD;
      compared with cognitive test data of control subjects. A low test score was defined when the&#xD;
      score was ≥ 2 SD lower than control subjects. For tests in which a higher score indicates&#xD;
      decrement in performance, a score ≥ 2 SD higher than control subjects was considered as &quot;low&#xD;
      test score.&quot; Patients were defined as having preoperative cognitive impairment if they had&#xD;
      low test scores on two or more tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients, preoperative scores were compared with postoperative test results, subtracted&#xD;
      the average practice effect from these changes, and then divided the result by the&#xD;
      control-subject SD to obtain a Z score for each test. The test results were adjusted so that&#xD;
      a positive Z score indicated deterioration from the baseline test. The Z scores of all tests&#xD;
      in an individual patient were then summarized and divided by the SD for this sum of Z scores&#xD;
      in the control subjects, creating a combined Z score. A patient was defined as having POCD&#xD;
      when two Z scores in individual tests or the combined Z score were 1.96 or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis A continuous outcome was expressed as the mean ± SE, while a categorical&#xD;
      outcome was expressed as percentages or frequencies. Differences in continuous and&#xD;
      categorical outcomes were tested using the one-way analysis of variance and Chi square&#xD;
      analysis, respectively. The unpaired Student t test, paired T test, analysis of variance and&#xD;
      Pearson correlation analysis were performed on normally distributed data. Case-control&#xD;
      differences in nominal data were evaluated with the Chi square test. Multivariate Cox&#xD;
      regression analysis was done for predictors of adverse events. The NLRP3 level, IL-1B, IL-18&#xD;
      and neurobehavioral scores were compared using ROC curves. Kaplan-Meier curves were used for&#xD;
      correlation with POCD. All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 21.0 (IBM Inc.) and&#xD;
      P &lt; 0.05 was considered signifcant.&#xD;
