      A Phase 1 Open-label Dose Escalation Study of BDB001 in Combination with Atezolizumab in&#xD;
      Subjects with Advanced Solid Tumors&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a study of an experimental drug called BDB001. BDB001 is a Toll-like&#xD;
      receptor (TLR) agonist that activates the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BDB001 in&#xD;
      combination with atezolizumab (Tecentriq) in subjects with unresectable or metastatic solid&#xD;
      tumors who have relapsed or are refractory to standard treatment or for whom there is no&#xD;
      approved therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-center, open-label, dose escalation/dose expansion Phase 1 study of BDB001 in&#xD;
      combination with atezolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in two separate but independent parts: a dose escalation part&#xD;
      with BDB001 and atezolizumab and a dose expansion part of BDB001 in combination with&#xD;
      atezolizumab.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants are excluded from the study if any of the following criteria apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A Woman of Child Bearing Potential who has a positive urine pregnancy test (e.g.&#xD;
             within 72 hours) prior to treatment. If the urine test is positive or cannot be&#xD;
             confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Prior exposure to TLR 7 agonists, such as GS-9620, imiquimod, TMX 101, resiquimod,&#xD;
             MEDI9197, and 825A, or TLR 9 agonists such as SD-101, tilsotolimod (IMO-2125),&#xD;
             MGN1703, GNKG168, DUK-CPG-001 and CMP-001 for treatment of the solid tumor the subject&#xD;
             is currently being evaluated for treatment with BDB001.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent or with&#xD;
             an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor such as&#xD;
             CTLA-4, OX40, and CD137, and was discontinued from that treatment due to a Grade 3 or&#xD;
             higher irAE.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Received previous therapy for malignancy within 21 days prior to administration of&#xD;
             study drug, including any investigational agents (other than BDB001), chemotherapy,&#xD;
             immunotherapy, biological or hormonal therapy. Subjects receiving systemic interferons&#xD;
             or IL-2 must have discontinued the drug 4 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer)&#xD;
             prior to initiation of study treatment because these drugs could potentially increase&#xD;
             the risk of autoimmune conditions when given in combination with atezolizumab.&#xD;
             Subjects receiving nitrosoureas or mitomycin C must have discontinued the drug 6 weeks&#xD;
             prior to initiation of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects who are receiving a RANKL inhibitor such as denosumab prior to enrollment&#xD;
             must be willing and eligible to receive a bisphosphonate instead; denosumab could&#xD;
             potentially alter the activity and the safety of atezolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Major surgery within 4 weeks of first dose of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Has received prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of start of study treatment.&#xD;
             Participants must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not require&#xD;
             corticosteroids, and not have had radiation pneumonitis. A 1-week washout is permitted&#xD;
             for palliative radiation (≤2 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-CNS disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
             Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles,&#xD;
             mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus&#xD;
             Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection&#xD;
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza&#xD;
             vaccines (e.g., FluMist) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Currently receiving medications known to be strong inhibitors of CYP1A and CYP3A and&#xD;
             strong/moderate inducers of CYP1A and CYP3A&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy&#xD;
             within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug. The use of physiologic doses of&#xD;
             corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational&#xD;
             agent or has used an investigational device within 21 days prior to the first dose of&#xD;
             study treatment. Note: Participants who have entered the follow-up phase of an&#xD;
             investigational study may participate as long as it has been 21 days after the last&#xD;
             dose of the previous investigational agent&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. History within last 6 months of New York Heart Association Class III or IV heart&#xD;
             failure, acute myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, uncontrolled arrhythmia, acute&#xD;
             coronary syndromes, stent placement, uncontrolled hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. QTc interval value &gt; 470 msec (using Fridericia's Correction)&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 50% by echocardiogram (ECHO) or multigated&#xD;
             acquisition (MUGA) scan&#xD;

             (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically&#xD;
             stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to&#xD;
             first dose of study treatment (Kim 2017). Brain MRI is preferred to document stability&#xD;
             of existing brain metastases. If MRI is medically contraindicated, CT with contrast is&#xD;
             an acceptable alternative.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Has severe hypersensitivity (≥Grade 3) to atezolizumab and/or any of its excipients&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. No HIV testing is&#xD;
             required unless mandated by local health authority&#xD;

&#xD;
         21. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the participant's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the participant to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Has a known psychiatric or substance abuse disorder that would interfere with the&#xD;
             participant's ability to cooperate with the requirements of the study&#xD;

         25. Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in past 2 years (i.e.,&#xD;
             with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs).&#xD;
             Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment and is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         26. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current&#xD;
             pneumonitis&#xD;
