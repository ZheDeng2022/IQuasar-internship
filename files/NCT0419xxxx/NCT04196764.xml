  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective observational study of 6 months of follow-up, of national and multicenter scope&#xD;
      with medical device with CE marking and according to the usual clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, due to the observational design of the clinical investigation, no assignment of&#xD;
      the patients will be made to any specific study group, but will be carried out in accordance&#xD;
      with the usual clinical practice, not applying any intervention other than the usual one in&#xD;
      this type of care practice and always in accordance with current clinical guidelines and&#xD;
      recommendations and with the indications authorized in Spain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited by specialists and will be followed for 6 months under the&#xD;
      conditions of usual clinical practice.&#xD;
