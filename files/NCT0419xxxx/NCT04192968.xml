  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to compare the responses recorded with automated cortical&#xD;
      auditory evoked potentials, of children who had one or two cochlear implants for 3 years, and&#xD;
      the results of the speech therapy assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      24 patients in the main ImplantHear3 study presented with disappointing language development&#xD;
      or poor cortical responses. These patients will be followed up once a year, during a visit&#xD;
      scheduled for the usual care, until 6 years post-implant, in order to make it possible to&#xD;
      objectify the quality of the auditory rehabilitation received by the child.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with severe to profound deafness can benefit from cochlear rehabilitation, combined&#xD;
      with a speech-language therapy. At present, 70 to 80% of children with congenital - profound&#xD;
      deafness who are implanted at an early age will have a language level identical to their&#xD;
      hearing peers. But 20 to 30% of them will be able to present linguistic difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective recording of the cortical activity in response to a sound stimulus gives a&#xD;
      proof of the quality of the auditory stimulation that is perceived by the cortex, an&#xD;
      essential condition for the further linguistic development of the child. By the use of&#xD;
      complex stimuli of speeching type, all the channels involved in the auditory processing are&#xD;
      analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recording in routine clinical practice of the cortical auditory evoked potentials in&#xD;
      response to a vocal stimulus makes it possible to objectify the quality of the auditory&#xD;
      rehabilitation received by the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implanted children all benefit from regular and prolonged speech therapy follow-up, with&#xD;
      a complete evaluation every year. It is important to regularly monitor the linguistic&#xD;
      evolution of young children who are implanted in order to identify children at risk of poorer&#xD;
      linguistic development at an early age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to compare the responses recorded with automated cortical&#xD;
      auditory evoked potentials, of children who had one or two cochlear implants for 3 years, and&#xD;
      the results of the speech therapy assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      24 patients in the main ImplantHear3 study presented with disappointing language development&#xD;
      or poor cortical responses. These patients will be followed up to 6 years post-implant by&#xD;
      carrying out, during a visit scheduled for patient care, once a year for 3 years:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recording of automated cortical auditory evoked potentials in response to a vocal&#xD;
           stimulus, as performed for the main study, but also :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recording of cortical auditory evoked potentials in response to a click&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Realization of electrical potentials via the implant And this in order to make it&#xD;
           possible to objectify the quality of the auditory rehabilitation received by the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the ancillary study are :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of the responses recorded to automated cortical auditory evoked potentials, of&#xD;
      children who have had one or two cochlear implants for 4 years, with the results of speech&#xD;
      therapy and up to 6 years post-implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Look for prognostic factors of poor linguistic development: correlate the&#xD;
      electrophysiological results, the adjustment parameters, the modalities of hearing&#xD;
      rehabilitation, the side of the cochlear implantation, and the audiometric thresholds with&#xD;
      the results of the speech therapy assessment.&#xD;
