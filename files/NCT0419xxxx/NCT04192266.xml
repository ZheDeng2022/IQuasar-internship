  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if taking a pill of estradiol (E2)&#xD;
      together with prolonged exposure (PE) therapy can improve this treatment outcome in women&#xD;
      diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). 80 subjects will take part in this&#xD;
      research study across NYU Langone Health and UPenn (40 subjects at each site). Participants&#xD;
      will be randomized into one of two groups, PE + E2 or PE + placebo. The study will include&#xD;
      preliminary screening and baseline visits, experimental visits, and therapy visits over the&#xD;
      course of six weeks. Several follow-up visits will take place.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prolonged-exposure (PE) therapy is the treatment of choice for posttraumatic stress disorder&#xD;
      (PTSD). Despite its efficacy, a significant number of individuals will not benefit from it or&#xD;
      might drop out before the completion of all sessions. This underlies the importance of&#xD;
      findings ways to enhance the efficacy of PE in order to improve the life quality of&#xD;
      individuals suffering from PTSD. It is now widely accepted that extinction learning paradigms&#xD;
      used in fundamental studies are useful laboratory analogs to PE. Studies in healthy controls&#xD;
      have suggested that elevated estrogen levels benefit extinction learning by promoting its&#xD;
      consolidation and thus enhancing its recall when tested later for it. This is also being&#xD;
      reflected by changes in the activation of brain regions forming the fear extinction network,&#xD;
      including the amygdala, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and ventromedial prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex (vmPFC). It is still unknown whether estradiol (E2) administration can modulate the&#xD;
      activation of the fear extinction network in oral contraceptive (OC) users and which E2 dose&#xD;
      could yield the best results. During the R61 phase of the study, we found that both doses of&#xD;
      E2 were effective in engaging the functional activation of the fear extinction network.&#xD;
      Therefore, we will use the lower dose (2mg) for the R33 phase. We will combine E2&#xD;
      administration with PE sessions to see if administration of PE can significantly improve&#xD;
      clinical outcomes (reduced PTSD symptoms) and engage the fear extinction network in the&#xD;
      brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: A general improvement is expected after 3 weeks of treatment in both groups given&#xD;
      the anticipated benefits of PE alone. But the benefit of the Estradiol-treated groups is&#xD;
      hypothesized be larger; with this group exhibiting significantly higher activation in brain&#xD;
      regions associated with fear extinction. This will be noted at the follow-up scan compared to&#xD;
      the baseline scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTSD symptom severity expected be significantly lower in the Estradiol and PE group relative&#xD;
      to the Placebo+PE group following acute treatment after three weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The degree of PTSD symptom reduction post- compared to pre-PE after 3 weeks of treatment is&#xD;
      expected be associated with BOLD changes in the fear extinction network and reduction in SCR&#xD;
      during the extinction recall test after PE. The magnitude of BOLD and SCR changes will be&#xD;
      significantly larger in the E2+PE group compared to the Plc+PE group.&#xD;
