  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For 28 days, 20 patients with tyrosinaemia will take TYR sphere as part of the usual dietary&#xD;
      management of their condition. Patients will record their adherence to recommended intakes&#xD;
      each day, gastrointestinal symptoms (if any) experienced each day of weeks one and four, and&#xD;
      the palatability of the product at the end of the trial. Metabolic control will be evaluated&#xD;
      by dried blood spots collected during the Baseline and End of Study visits, and weekly during&#xD;
      the 28 days of the study itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial data will be used in an application to make TYR sphere available via the NHS.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TYR sphere is a glycomacropeptide (GMP) based protein substitute for patients with&#xD;
      tyrosinaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Evaluation of TYR sphere study has been designed to generate data required by the United&#xD;
      Kingdom's Advisory Committee on Borderline Substances (ACBS), the national regulator for&#xD;
      Foods for Special Medical Purposes (FSMP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ACBS specify that before a FSMP can be routinely prescribed by the NHS, its acceptability&#xD;
      must first be evaluated by a clinical trial in patients for whom it is ultimately designed.&#xD;
      The ACBS define acceptability as comprising patient evaluations of the product's&#xD;
      palatability, data on their adherence to recommended intakes and their gastrointestinal&#xD;
      tolerance of it. TYR sphere is designed for patients of three years of age and upwards. This&#xD;
      has informed the trial's age-related inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a mobile phone application, or paper diary form, patients will record their intake of&#xD;
      TYR sphere along with the recommended amount on each of the 28 study days. Gastrointestinal&#xD;
      tolerance will be recorded each day during weeks one and four, while palatability of TYR&#xD;
      sphere will be recorded at the end of the 28 days, or immediately on discontinuing TYR sphere&#xD;
      if the patient stops the trial early. An evaluation of the patient's previous protein&#xD;
      substitute and usual GI symptoms are recorded on day one, before the first intake of TYR&#xD;
      sphere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic control, measured via dried blood spots taken at both visits, and weekly during the&#xD;
      28 days study period, is another primary outcome measure alongside acceptability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial's secondary endpoint is evaluations of growth. Height and weight will be recorded&#xD;
      at the Baseline and End of Study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If it is deemed appropriate by the investigator, patients may continue to take the product at&#xD;
      the end of the Evaluation Period as part of Care After Research. This continued supply would&#xD;
      be given free of charge by the sponsor up until the product is available via a regular&#xD;
      prescription, having completed the registration process with the ACBS.&#xD;
