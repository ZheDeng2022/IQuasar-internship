  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II clinical trial assessing the tolerability and efficacy of CM4620 in&#xD;
      children and young adults with acute pancreatitis caused by asparaginase. The tolerability of&#xD;
      CM4620 when given to patients receiving frontline chemotherapy will be determined. The&#xD;
      effectiveness in reducing the severity of pancreatitis will be estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the safety of CM4620 administration in children and young adults with asparaginase&#xD;
      associated pancreatitis (AAP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To profile dose-limiting toxicities and responses of the patients treated in the dose-finding&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate the efficacy of CM4620 to prevent pseudocyst or necrotizing pancreatitis in&#xD;
      children with AAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effect of CM4620 on the incidence of severe pancreatitis&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effect of CM4620 on the incidence of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome&#xD;
      (SIRS).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label safety and efficacy evaluation with comparison of toxicity to a&#xD;
      historical control population (TOTXVI).There will be 3 cohorts of patients enrolled, and the&#xD;
      dose for each cohort will be determined based on the toxicities experienced in the ongoing&#xD;
      and prior cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An initial 9 patients (cohort 1) will be enrolled and will receive dose level 1 and monitored&#xD;
      for toxicity. If the therapy is well tolerated, 6 patients (cohort 2) will be treated at dose&#xD;
      level 2. Subsequent enrollment of 9 patients (cohort 3) will be at either dose level 1 or 2&#xD;
      based on tolerability. The keyboard design will be used to determine the dosing for cohorts 2&#xD;
      and 3. Additional patients will be enrolled at the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) until a&#xD;
      total of 24 patients have been treated at that dose, including any treated during the&#xD;
      dose-finding phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CM4620 will be given days 1-4 as an IV infusion beginning within 36 hours of the onset of&#xD;
      acute pancreatitis associated abdominal pain and within 8 hours of enrollment. For patients&#xD;
      with prior abdominal pain or in those unable to communicate the location/characteristic of&#xD;
      their pain, a change in the characteristic of the pain or new enzyme elevation/imaging&#xD;
      findings after previously normal studies will determine the timing of onset of pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for about 4 months after treatment.&#xD;
