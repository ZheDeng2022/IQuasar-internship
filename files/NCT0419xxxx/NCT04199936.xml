  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients lose a significant amount of muscle following major abdominal surgery. This is&#xD;
      partly due to a catabolic response to the surgical insult and inflammation, but is also&#xD;
      probably due to a lack of muscle use secondary to immobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will aim to assess whether some or even all of postoperative muscle loss in the&#xD;
      upper leg muscle group is preventable through electrical muscle stimulation to mimic physical&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following major gastrointestinal surgery patients may loose around 6 % of their skeletal&#xD;
      muscle mass in the first 5 days. Whilst some of this loss is as a result of inflammation and&#xD;
      starvation, some is due to muscle disuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that patients spend 96% of their time being sedentary in the first 5 days&#xD;
      following major abdominal surgery and by day 5 are still taking a median of less than 500&#xD;
      steps per day. Studies of healthy volunteers who undergo similar muscle disuse loose&#xD;
      approximately 3.5% of skeletal muscle mass over the same time period, indicating that around&#xD;
      half of postoperative muscle loss may be due to immobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through the use of electrical muscle stimulation, this study will aim to mimic high levels of&#xD;
      exercise in the quadriceps of patients who have undergo major gastrointestinal surgery to see&#xD;
      whether this reduces or prevents muscle loss. Patients muscles will be measured using&#xD;
      ultrasound and DXA and neuromuscular function will be measured using electromyography.&#xD;
