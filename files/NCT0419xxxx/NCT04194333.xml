  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) is used to access peripheral and central&#xD;
      parenchymal lung lesions via endobronchial and transbronchial approach. Traditionally ENB is&#xD;
      done under fluoroscopic guidance using C-arm but with development of Cone Beam CT and 3D&#xD;
      reconstruction technology, fluoroscopy can be enhanced to much higher resolution and can also&#xD;
      provide real time 3D augmentation of the lesion. It also enables the user to obtain a CT of&#xD;
      the Chest to confirm the real time location of the lesion and the bronchoscopic biopsy&#xD;
      catheter and instruments. This is thought to improve the yield and sensitivity of ENB guided&#xD;
      Biopsy of the lung nodules and masses but has not been proven in a prospective trial. With my&#xD;
      study, I want to examine the effect of Cone Beam CT with 3D reconstruction on the diagnostic&#xD;
      yield and sensitivity of Electromagnetic Navigational Bronchoscopic biopsy of the lung&#xD;
      lesions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy has been used for more than a decade to access&#xD;
      peripheral and central parenchymal lung lesions bronchoscopically. Traditionally standard&#xD;
      fluoroscopy using C-arm is used to confirm the location and guide the biopsy instruments&#xD;
      under real-time guidance. With availability of Cone Beam CT, fluoroscopic images of much&#xD;
      higher quality and resolution can be obtained intra-operatively. It also enables the&#xD;
      bronchoscopist to obtain intraoperative CT images and confirm the exact location of the&#xD;
      lesion and the Bronchoscopic biopsy catheter or the biopsy instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At my institution, lung nodules/masses requiring ENB have been approached using Medtronic&#xD;
      Super-Dimension Version 7 Electromagnetic Navigational Bronchoscopy system. All the&#xD;
      procedures are done under fluroscopic guidance using a regular C-Arm. All the lesions are&#xD;
      confirmed using peripheral Endobronchial Ultrasound (EBUS). Once the appropriate location is&#xD;
      reached, biopsy is obtained using FNA (18G or 21G), Single or Triple needle brush,&#xD;
      Transbronchial forceps and Bronchoalveolar lavage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pathologist is present on site for all the cases to review the slides and assist in&#xD;
      diagnosis. All the cases are done under general anesthesia through endotracheal tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, all the ENB procedures have been performed by one Interventional Pulmonologist since&#xD;
      August 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the interventional arm, all the aspects will remain the same except that the cases are&#xD;
      done in Hybrid OR instead of Endoscopy. All the patients are completely paralyzed&#xD;
      intra-operatively. Also, instead of a standard C-Arm providing 2D fluoroscopic guidance, a&#xD;
      Philips Azurion 7 C20 FlexMove system with Emboguide, 3D Segmentaion and Overlay tools is&#xD;
      being used. This enables the bronchoscopist to obtain a CT scan of the chest and also segment&#xD;
      out the lesion(s) of interest and to overlap the 3-D image of the lesion on live fluoroscopy&#xD;
      in all 3 dimensions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the ENB procedures, at least 1 full Xpert CT is going to be obtained, mostly after&#xD;
      completing the airway registration and ENB guided approach the lesion. Once the extended&#xD;
      working channel and the locatable guide is advanced to the lesion using ENB guidance, the&#xD;
      catheter is locked and scope held in place. The patient is maintained in inspiratory breath&#xD;
      hold and Cone Beam Ct is used to obtain the Xpert CT that shows the lesion and surrounding&#xD;
      lungs, chest and mediastinal structures in the surrounding area of the chest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is then used to analyze the location of the lesion and the lesion of the extended&#xD;
      working channel, locatable guide and the biopsy instruments in relation to the lesion. The&#xD;
      lesion is then segmented and EmboGuide+Overlay feature is used to project a 3D view of the&#xD;
      lesion on the live fluoroscopic images in all three axis. This also allows the bronchoscopist&#xD;
      to obtain Anterior-posterior, Lateral and oblique views at various angles while maintaining&#xD;
      the 3D overlap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional CT scans might be obtained intra-operatively if needed to guide the biopsy&#xD;
      catheter appropriately towards the lesion. Due to the live nature of the Cone Beam CT, it is&#xD;
      much more capable of providing accurate guidance regarding the location of the lesion and the&#xD;
      biopsy instruments. hence, in case of any discrepancy, information provided by Cone Beam CT&#xD;
      is considered more reliable and used with higher confidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rest of the steps involved in procedure are similar between the control and the&#xD;
      interventional arm including the surgeon, type of bronchoscopes, type of electromagnetic&#xD;
      navigational system, use of peripheral Endobronchial Ultrasound and availability of on-site&#xD;
      pathologist. The biopsy instruments used are also the same including transbronchial needle&#xD;
      for FNA, Single or triple needle brush and transbronchial forceps. Bronchoalveolar lavage is&#xD;
      also obtained at the end via extended working channel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients undergoing biopsy of the peripheral/central lung lesions using ENB also&#xD;
      undergo Convex EBUS guided mediastinal surveillance and EBUS-TBFNA of any Lymph Node that&#xD;
      appears to be greater than 5 mm on EBUS exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      My study aims to study the effect of using Cone Beam CT with segmentation, 3-D overlay and CT&#xD;
      augmented fluoroscopy on sensitivity and diagnostic yield of electromagnetic navigation&#xD;
      bronchoscopy for diagnosis of peripheral and central lung lesions including lung nodules and&#xD;
      masses which could not be directly accessed using just white light bronchoscope.&#xD;
