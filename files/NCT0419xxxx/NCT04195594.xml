  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study will investigate the effects of Nic's Ketogenic diet, comprised of 70% fat,&#xD;
      5% carbohydrate, and 25% protein on middle-aged males and females with mid-range elevated&#xD;
      LDL. With the mixed evidence on the causative effect of LDL cholesterol on increased&#xD;
      cardiovascular health risk, further studies are warranted to examine the relation of elevated&#xD;
      LDL and other biomarkers of cardiovascular health in response to a lifestyle intervention.&#xD;
      Furthermore, this study will investigate weight loss and body composition changes with&#xD;
      adherence to this dietary intervention over a 140-day period. In this study the efficacy of&#xD;
      Nic's Ketogenic diet on weight loss and biomarkers of cardiovascular health will be examined.&#xD;

      <desc>During the study, participants recorded AEs in their diary. At each visit, the participant was asked &quot;have you experienced any difficulties or problems since I last saw you?&quot; upon which answers (AEs) were documented in the study record and were classified as per the description, duration, intensity, frequency, and outcome. The qualified investigator assessed any AEs and decided causality.</desc>
