  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the new aScope 4 Cysto is used to see how well it visualizes the lower urinary&#xD;
      tract, and if this new flexible cystoscope performs as well as other routinely used&#xD;
      cystoscopes. This study will be done in patients who have been diagnosed with bladder lesions&#xD;
      and who will undergo surgery via the urethra to remove these lesions. The surgery is done&#xD;
      under general anesthesia. After being brought under anesthesia and before removal of the&#xD;
      lesion(s), the new flexible cystoscope is tested. The cystoscope will be used to visualize&#xD;
      the urethra and bladder. Data will be collected on the number of the lesions that can be seen&#xD;
      using the new cystoscope. During the planned surgery a resectoscope or rigid cystoscope will&#xD;
      be used to confirm the number of lesions. The data will be used to show how well the&#xD;
      cystoscope visualizes the lesions in comparison with routinely used cystoscopes. It will give&#xD;
      information on how well the structures of the urinary tract and bladder can be viewed&#xD;
      including any abnormalities that are present.Data will also be collected on the handling of&#xD;
      the cystoscope: how well the cystoscope moves into the lower urinary tract, and how well it&#xD;
      can be navigated through the lower urinary tract.&#xD;

      Clinical Phase: pre-CE study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A non-randomized confirmatory study on the visualization performance of the Ambu®&#xD;
      aScope™ 4 Cysto and aView™ Urologia in 42 fully evaluable, adults subjects aimed at&#xD;
      identification of known pathological findings (papillary bladder or small resectable lesion)&#xD;
      detected with Ambu® aScope™ 4 Cysto and aView™ Urologia and subsequently during a repeat&#xD;
      procedure using a reusable rigid scope or resectoscope at the time of planned transurethral&#xD;
      resection of bladder tumours (TURBT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: Adult subjects (≥ 18 years) in the OR undergoing planned transurethral resection&#xD;
      of bladder tumors TURBT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned sample size: A total of 42 patients will result in a maximum (if the true proportion&#xD;
      is 50 %) width of the two-sided 95 % confidence interval for the binary variable &quot;Confirmed&quot;&#xD;
      to be 15%. This width is considered to be useful in the interpretations of the results from&#xD;
      this investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration: Screening, procedure and follow-up will take 15 days maximum&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up duration: Follow-up immediately after procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational Device: Ambu® aScope™ 4 Cysto and aView™ Urologia Pre-CE, single use&#xD;
      cystoscope.&#xD;

    <description>The performance level of Ambu® aScope™ 4 Cysto and aView™ Urologia, compared to current standard practice with re-usable cystoscopes, is defined as proportion of patients with one or more papillary bladder lesion or small resectable lesion (diagnosed a maximum of one month prior to resection) detected with the Ambu® aScope™ 4 Cysto and aView™ Urologia (prior to planned transurethral resection of bladder tumors (TURBT)) and confirmed with the rigid cystoscope during TURBT.</description>
