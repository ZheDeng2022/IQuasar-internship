  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thoracic aneurysm incidence is estimated to 4.5 cases per 100 000. The manifestation as well&#xD;
      as natural history of thoracic aneurysm depend on many factors such as its localisation, its&#xD;
      diameter, presence of collagen disease and family history. For the ascendant aortic aneurysm,&#xD;
      it is often linked to a degeneration of the media arterial layer of the arterial wall. The&#xD;
      media degeneration is cause by the degeneration of the elastic fibres, which lead to a&#xD;
      weakening of the arterial wall accompanied with dilation. This process is often due to age&#xD;
      and is accelerated by high blood pressure. Amongst the numerous factors causing the aneurysm,&#xD;
      the investigators find: hypertension, aortic bicuspid valve, smoking, atherosclerosis, trauma&#xD;
      and genetic predisposition. The average growth rate of thoracic aneurysm is 0.1-0.2 cm/year.&#xD;
      The risk of rupture is associated to the size of the aneurysm as well as patient's symptoms.&#xD;
      The ruptures and dissections rates are accounted for 2-3/year for thoracic aneurysm between&#xD;
      5.5-6.0 cm in diameter. The patients are often limited in their daily life activities&#xD;
      considering their concern and risk of rupture and/or dissect. The effects of exercise on the&#xD;
      progression of the aneurysm dilation in patients with thoracic ascendant aortic aneurysm are&#xD;
      unknown. It is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for rupture of the aortic&#xD;
      aneurysm. Many studies have demonstrated the benefits of physical exercise regarding the&#xD;
      lowering impact of blood pressure in a cardiac hypertensive population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 3 and 6 months of the intervention, the subjects in the exercise group will have: 1) a&#xD;
      lowered blood pressure at rest and during exercise, 2) maintenance/ improvement of muscle&#xD;
      strength, 3) improvement of aerobic exercise capacity (VO2max), and 4) aortic dilation that&#xD;
      remained stable or comparable to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research objective is to measure and compare to a control group, the effects of an&#xD;
      exercise program on the following parameters: blood pressure response at rest and during&#xD;
      exercise, as well as the VO2max at 3 and 6 months time of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomised and prospective study will take place at the &quot; Institut Universitaire de&#xD;
      Cardiologie et de Pneumologie du Québec (IUCPQ) &quot; and will include patients who have a&#xD;
      non-surgical ascendant thoracic aortic aneurysm (ATAA). The selected subjects will be&#xD;
      randomised into two groups: 1) exercise group (n=15), and 2) control group (n=15). Both&#xD;
      groups will be met prior to the intervention (baseline) and at 3 and 6 months time of the&#xD;
      intervention, and measures described below will be recorded.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      To this day, the impact and influence of physical activity in this population has been&#xD;
      reported in very few studies, and all have been led in a population with abdominal aorta&#xD;
      aneurysm (AAA). These studies conclude that patients should avoid lifting heavy loads as well&#xD;
      as performing isometric muscular exercises since these maneuvers increase significantly&#xD;
      intra-thoracic pressure as well as blood pressure. As for aerobic exercise, it is recommended&#xD;
      that all patient wanting to participate in high intensity activities must perform a&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary exercise test (VO2max) to ensure that the systolic blood pressure does no&#xD;
      exceed 180 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enable us to know the effects of a moderate to high intensity exercise&#xD;
      program (80% of anaerobic threshold) on blood pressure response in this population. This will&#xD;
      also allow the quantification and qualification of the blood pressure changes following an&#xD;
      exercise program as well as the safeness of such an intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric measures will be taken for both groups before, at 3 months and 6 months&#xD;
      intervention. Firstly, the subjects will be measured using a stadiometer scaled in cm. Then,&#xD;
      they will be weighed using a bio-impedance scale of the type InBody (InBody 520, Body&#xD;
      Composition Analyzer) in order to measure body composition. The mass values and height will&#xD;
      be used to calculate the body mass index (BMI). Finally, waist circumference will be measured&#xD;
      directly on the abdomen on the level of the iliac crest using a measuring tape scaled in cm.&#xD;
      Waist circumference will be used to assess indirectly abdominal obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to measure blood pressure variations and the hypotensive effect of exercise, a&#xD;
      24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in both groups will be performed at&#xD;
      baseline, at 3 months and at 6 months intervention. In the exercise group, the ABPM will also&#xD;
      be performed on a consecutive first training session. The measure will be performed over a&#xD;
      period of 24 hours. The measures will be taken every 30 minutes during the day and every hour&#xD;
      during the night.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cardiopulmonary exercise test will be performed before, at 3 months and at 6 months&#xD;
      intervention, in order to asses the maximum aerobic capacity (VO2max) of the subjects in both&#xD;
      groups. This test will take place on an ergometer cycle with electromagnetic brakes (Lode&#xD;
      Recumbent, Groningen, Nederland) which allows to determine the work (watts) independently of&#xD;
      the rpm. Subjects will breathe in a mouthpiece related to a gas analyser (MedGraphics,&#xD;
      St-Paul, MN). Furthermore, a 12 derivation electrocardiogram (Cardioperfect Welch-Allyn,&#xD;
      Skaneateles Falls, NY) measuring cardiac activity and an oximeter (N-395 Nellcor, Boulder,&#xD;
      CO) measuring the blood oxygen saturation will be installed on the subject for the entire&#xD;
      duration of the test. Finally, every two minutes during the test, blood pressure measure will&#xD;
      be taken followed by the effort perception based on the modified Borg scale. This test is&#xD;
      administered by a certified Clinical Exercise Specialist from the American College of Sport&#xD;
      Medicine (ACSM) and supervised by a physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A strength evaluation will be performed for both groups before, 3 months and at 6 months&#xD;
      intervention. In order to obtain a specific and reliable exercise prescription for each&#xD;
      subject, the 1 maximal repetition (MR) will be estimated using linear equations &lt;10 MR since&#xD;
      it is not recommended to asses 1 MR in this population due to the high blood pressure that&#xD;
      this type of evaluation generates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Handgrip strength will be measured. In a standing position, the patient will perform a&#xD;
      maximum muscle contraction of the hand (hand dynamometer). This test will be performed with&#xD;
      the right and left hand alternately. Strength evaluation, including the preparation and&#xD;
      explanations, will last approximately 45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to note the energy expense of each participant in both groups, a wireless portable&#xD;
      monitor SenseWearPro2 (SWA; Body Media, Pittsburgh, USA) will be used. This monitor is an&#xD;
      armband that subjects will use at baseline, at 3 months and 6 months. It will be worn during&#xD;
      3 consecutive days, 2 weekdays and 1 day during the weekend. The subjects will wear the&#xD;
      armband as soon as they wake up in the morning and will remove it at bedtime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A CT scan will be performed prior to the study (inclusion criteria; recent CT scan &lt; 6&#xD;
      months), and at the end of the intervention, at 6 months. These CT scans are clinically&#xD;
      required for follow up of the aneurysm dilation measure post intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects randomized in the exercise group will follow a 24-week structured supervised&#xD;
      exercise program at the &quot;Pavillon de Prévention des Maladies Cardiaques (PPMC) &quot;. Each&#xD;
      subject will have a personalized program. The goal is to perform this program 3x/week, and&#xD;
      each session will last approximately 60 minutes: 40 minutes high intensity intervals training&#xD;
      on cycle ergometer and 20 minutes strength training (2-3 sets, 10-15 repetitions). If needed,&#xD;
      every week, the kinesiologist will adjust each participant's exercise program accordingly.&#xD;
      The kinesiologist will be certified clinical exercise specialist from the ACSM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During every session, blood pressure will be monitored at rest, following 5 minutes seated,&#xD;
      before and after the session. Blood pressure will be taken during the high intensity interval&#xD;
      and one during the low intensity interval. Heart rate will also be monitored during the&#xD;
      intervals in order to calculate the double product (HR x SBP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in the control group will have a consultation at 3 and 6 months time of the&#xD;
      intervention with the kinesiologist. The consultation will last 1 hour. They will be given&#xD;
      general advice regarding physical activity as well as healthy lifestyle.&#xD;
