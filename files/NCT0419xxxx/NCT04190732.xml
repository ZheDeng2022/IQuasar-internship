      Overview This will be a randomized controlled trial to compare if physician contact within&#xD;
      the period from embryo transfer to first pregnancy test decreases anxiety levels for&#xD;
      first-time IVF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Study participation will not influence any element of IVF treatment, and all patients&#xD;
      will be receiving the standard of care at Boston IVF. Potential participants will be&#xD;
      identified by a member of the research team, who will review the appointment log and medical&#xD;
      records to ensure eligibility. Participants who meet eligibility criteria will receive an&#xD;
      email introduction to the study on the first stimulation day of the cycle and participants&#xD;
      will be asked if interested in participating. Interested participants can click a secure&#xD;
      REDCap link to learn more about that study. Participants who agree to participate will be&#xD;
      directed via a unique link for each participant to a REDCap survey to complete a baseline&#xD;
      questionnaire prior to the first ultrasound monitoring (T1), which is normally day 3 to 6 of&#xD;
      IVF stimulation. Participants that complete the baseline survey are consenting for the study.&#xD;
      Baseline demographic data will be obtained from the electronic medical record including: age,&#xD;
      race, education level, partner status, height, weight, gravidity, and parity. Baseline&#xD;
      clinical data, including anti-mullerian hormone and day 3 follicle stimulating hormone&#xD;
      levels, will be obtained from the electronic medical record. The baseline survey will include&#xD;
      demographic questions, the state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI), and the Hospital Anxiety and&#xD;
      Depression Scale (HADS). STAI and HADS are two validated surveys used widely when examining&#xD;
      anxiety in patients. The STAI is comprised of the trait and state questions. After&#xD;
      stimulation day 3, a reminder email will be sent to eligible participants via REDCap to&#xD;
      introduce the study again with a follow up phone call on stimulation day 4, if needed. Given&#xD;
      the quick turnaround time from stimulation day 1 to first ultrasound monitoring (stimulation&#xD;
      day 3 to 6), the additional email/phone contact schedule is necessary. If participants do not&#xD;
      complete the baseline survey in entirety, participants will not be eligible for&#xD;
      randomization. Participants will need to complete the survey in one sitting. Randomization&#xD;
      will only occur if participants have an embryo transfer and complete the baseline survey. If&#xD;
      selected to the intervention arm, participants will be called by one physician 3 to 4 days&#xD;
      after the embryo transfer. Participants will be informed that the physician contact is not&#xD;
      the participants specific doctor of record and that the physician contact will not be able to&#xD;
      answer specific questions about the participants treatment cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants that have an embryo transfer (fresh or frozen) will have a scheduled serum&#xD;
      beta-hCG 10-12 days after the date of transfer. Eight days after the transfer (T2),&#xD;
      participants will receive a second survey that will only include the STAI - state and HADS to&#xD;
      be completed prior to the first serum beta-hCG. If participants have not started the survey&#xD;
      by 9 days after the transfer, the participant will receive a reminder email on stimulation&#xD;
      day 9 in the morning followed by a phone call on stimulation day 9 in the evening if needed&#xD;
      for a reminder to complete the survey. The participant has the option to withdraw from the&#xD;
      study at any time by notifying the research team by email or phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Participants will receive routine care or an approximately five-minute phone&#xD;
      call from a physician 3 to 4 days after a fresh or frozen embryo transfer. The physician will&#xD;
      state they are a part of the research team. For participants that do not answer the phone, a&#xD;
      message will be left stating the participant will receive another phone call that same day&#xD;
      and once more the following day if the participant does not answer on the second attempt. The&#xD;
      phone call will follow scripted questions and utilize scripted phrases to help minimize&#xD;
      variation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Participants undergoing a fresh embryo transfer or planned frozen embryo&#xD;
      transfer/PGT-A are eligible for inclusion in the study. Participants will be block-randomized&#xD;
      by type of transfer to ensure balance between the intervention and control groups. The&#xD;
      randomization scheme will be generated via REDCap. If participants are randomized to the&#xD;
      intervention arm, participants will know this only if the participant receives a physician&#xD;
      phone call during the waiting period after embryo transfers. All participants, regardless of&#xD;
      transfer type, will be randomized only after participants have an embryo transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Justification The sample size calculation is based on data from a prior study&#xD;
      that evaluated stress throughout the course of a IVF cycle using the STAI. The mean STAI-S in&#xD;
      the infertility population ranges from 33-50, with Turner et al. reporting a mean STAI-S&#xD;
      score of 40 ± 12. Assuming that the mean STAI-S score in the control group will be 40 ± 12 at&#xD;
      the second time point, the investigators hypothesize that the mean STAI-S at this point in&#xD;
      the intervention group will decrease to 35 ± 12. In order to achieve 80% power to detect the&#xD;
      specified difference using a two-sided alpha of 0.05, the investigators will need 91&#xD;
      evaluable participants per arm. The Investigators anticipate that approximately 15% of&#xD;
      participants will not complete the second survey, and the investigators will inflate the&#xD;
      sample size by another 15% to account for a non-normal distribution. Thus, the investigators&#xD;
      aim to randomize 121 participants per arm for a total of 242 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Descriptive data will be presented as the proportion, mean with standard&#xD;
      deviation, or median with interquartile range. Comparisons will be made using the chi-square&#xD;
      or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and parametric or non-parametric tests for&#xD;
      continuous variables based on data distribution. All data will be analyzed with SAS 9.4 (SAS&#xD;
      Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). All tests will be two sided and a P value &lt;0.05 will be&#xD;
      required to confer significance.&#xD;

    <description>The investigators will assess change in anxiety levels from T1 to T2 using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory - State survey. A lower score on the State Trait Anxiety Inventory - State at T2 signifies a decrease in anxiety levels for a participant.
