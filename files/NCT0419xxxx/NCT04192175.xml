      Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) who are admitted to hospital are&#xD;
      at high risk of readmission. While therapies have improved and there are evidence-based&#xD;
      guidelines to reduce readmissions, there are significant challenges to implementation&#xD;
      including 1) identifying all patients with COPD early in admission to ensure evidence-based,&#xD;
      high value care is provided and 2) identifying those who are at high risk of readmission in&#xD;
      order to effectively target resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using machine learning and natural language processing, we want to develop models to 1)&#xD;
      identify all patients with COPD exacerbations admitted to hospital and 2) stratify them to&#xD;
      distinguish those who are at high risk of readmission b) How will you undertake your work?&#xD;
      From Toronto hospitals, we will develop a very large dataset of patient admissions for all&#xD;
      medical conditions including exacerbations of COPD from the electronic health record. This&#xD;
      data will include both structured data such as age, gender, medications, laboratory values,&#xD;
      co-morbidities as well as unstructured data such as discharge summaries and physician notes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the dataset, we will train a model through natural language processing and machine&#xD;
      learning to be able to identify people admitted with COPD exacerbation and identify those&#xD;
      patients who will be at high risk of readmission within 30 days. We will test the ability of&#xD;
      these models to determine our predictive accuracies. We will then test these models at other&#xD;
      institutions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      One fifth of patients discharged from hospital for COPD exacerbations are readmitted within&#xD;
      30 days.(1, 3, 4) While therapies and care guidelines have improved, guideline implementation&#xD;
      remains poor.(5) Implementing appropriate standards through usual hospital workflow presents&#xD;
      significant challenges. One of the top challenges is ensuring all eligible patients with COPD&#xD;
      exacerbations are identified in a timely manner.(6) Another top challenge is that staff are&#xD;
      often too busy and do not have time to execute evidence-based practices that reduce&#xD;
      readmissions.(6) Furthermore, intensive case management can not be offered to everyone&#xD;
      because of limited resources. Therefore, it is important that we are able to identify both&#xD;
      people who are admitted with COPD early as well as those who are at high risk for&#xD;
      readmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COPD exacerbations may, at times, not be easily recognized at first and take days to become&#xD;
      apparent. Symptoms of exacerbations such as shortness of breath are not specific and signs&#xD;
      such as chest radiograph infiltrates can be due to one or more diagnoses. Furthermore, COPD&#xD;
      exacerbations can trigger or be triggered by other diseases. As a result, it is not uncommon&#xD;
      for admitting physicians to admit patients with multiple provisional diagnoses of heart&#xD;
      failure, pneumonia, COPD exacerbation and more. Distinguishing people with COPD exacerbations&#xD;
      is further confounded by Electronic Health Records (EHRs) that do not have diagnoses listed&#xD;
      as coded elements. The end result is that it is difficult for the rest of the&#xD;
      interprofessional team to find COPD patients early in admission. This has been addressed in&#xD;
      some U.S. hospitals by having non-health care providers review charts to identify patients&#xD;
      admitted with for COPD.(7) An alternate approach has been machine learning and natural&#xD;
      language processing. This has been implemented with some success for patients with heart&#xD;
      failure but little has been done for people with COPD.(13) In one pilot program, natural&#xD;
      language processing helped identify patients admitted with COPD.(7)&#xD;
&#xD;
      To target scarce resources for those who need it most, it would be helpful to further&#xD;
      identify patients at high risk of readmission. This would be the first step in determining&#xD;
      how to implement effective strategies to reduce readmission rates. There are readmission&#xD;
      prediction models developed for medical and surgical patients including the LACE score and&#xD;
      the HOSPITAL score.(8, 9) Unfortunately, those that have been studied do not appear to&#xD;
      perform well in the COPD population.(10) While factors have been identified that help predict&#xD;
      COPD readmission, the models have not been fully validated.(11, 12) The performance could be&#xD;
      improved through the use of unstructured data such as clinician progress notes and discharge&#xD;
      summaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early identification of people with COPD and knowledge of those who are at risk of&#xD;
      readmission can improve health outcomes. Zafar et al. demonstrated that a comprehensive COPD&#xD;
      care bundle that consisted of 1. inhaler assessment, 2. appropriate inhaler regimen, 3. early&#xD;
      discharge follow up and 4. patient-centered discharge instructions reduced readmissions.(14)&#xD;
      Identification of those at high risk of readmission could facilitate enrollment into&#xD;
      intensive case management. Therefore, we will conduct the current study to identify patients&#xD;
      admitted with acute exacerbations of COPD and stratify patients according to risk of&#xD;
      readmission&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using retrospective data from the University Health Network (UHN), we will create a data set&#xD;
      of admissions to General Internal Medicine for the past 5 years. We estimate this will&#xD;
      include approximately 40,000 admissions of which 2,000 will have a most responsible diagnoses&#xD;
      of a COPD exacerbation. The data set will contain both structured coded data as well as&#xD;
      unstructured text data. Coded data will include age, gender, medications ordered,&#xD;
      co-morbidities, laboratory values, and pulmonary function tests. Unstructured text data will&#xD;
      include notes in EHR: physician clinic notes, discharge summaries, admission diagnoses,&#xD;
      progress notes, and notes from our signover system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: We will use several different methods to develop the model including logistic&#xD;
      regression, deep neural networks, and convolutional neural networks. Specifically, we will&#xD;
      also use statistical machine learning algorithms for event detection using bi-directional&#xD;
      long-short term memory neural networks across a variety of input types (e.g., Fourier filter&#xD;
      banks, Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, wavelets, and raw audio). We will also use&#xD;
      traditional methods such as dynamic Bayes networks and conditional random fields. On the text&#xD;
      analytics side, we will identify key phrases that predict readmission. One approach will be&#xD;
      to use discourse analysis to single out &quot;nucleus&quot; phrases from background text. We will also&#xD;
      build &quot;joint&quot; predictive models that combine features from the unstructured text and features&#xD;
      from the structured coded data. We will use the standard Area under the ROC Curve to assess&#xD;
      model performance and use cross validation to minimize the impact of overfitting. Finally, we&#xD;
      will then validate our models using a dataset from different centres to determine whether&#xD;
      these results are valid and generalizable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated results: The development of two validated models based on EHR data: one to&#xD;
      accurately identify patients with AECOPD and the second to accurately identify patients at&#xD;
      high risk of readmission within 30 days.&#xD;
