      Examining the effectiveness of cricoid pressure using ultrasound imaging. Pulmonary&#xD;
      aspiration of gastric contents during tracheal intubation, although rare in pediatrics, is a&#xD;
      potentially catastrophic complication of anesthesia. Cricoid pressure is applied during rapid&#xD;
      sequence induction to occlude the esophagus and prevent aspiration of gastric contents.&#xD;
      Accumulating evidence in adults suggests that cricoid pressure often is not effective, either&#xD;
      because the esophagus normally lies lateral to the cricoid cartilage, or because downward&#xD;
      pressure on the cricoid cartilage laterally displaces (rather than compresses) the esophagus.&#xD;
      The investigator proposes to examine the effectiveness of cricoid pressure in children in the&#xD;
      peri-operative setting using non-invasive ultrasound imaging. Using this approach, the&#xD;
      investigator will investigate the normal anatomical relationship of the esophagus and the&#xD;
      cricoid cartilage, as well as how cricoid pressures influences this relationship. Further,&#xD;
      the investigator will examine whether alternatives to downward cricoid pressure, such as&#xD;
      laterally directed pressure, are more effective at occluding the esophagus.&#xD;

      D. Design and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study design This study is interventional study of intubated or sedated children who are&#xD;
           in the operating room or admitted to the MSICU (Medical Surgical Intensive Care Unit).&#xD;
           The intervention is the application of cricoid pressure and also left lateral&#xD;
           paratracheal pressure. The outer diameter and position of the esophagus will be assessed&#xD;
           sonographically before and after the intervention is performed. Patients and families&#xD;
           will be recruited in person either in the pre-op clinic or in the MSICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient selection and inclusion/exclusion criteria All patients age 0 - 17 years who are&#xD;
           on the OR (operating room) schedule and all patients admitted to the MSICU will be&#xD;
           screened for this study. Patients in the MSICU will only be included if they are sedated&#xD;
           as part of their clinical management.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exclusion criteria: 1) history of airway or esophageal malformations (e.g. esophageal&#xD;
           atresia or trachea-esophageal fistula) or who have had prior surgical procedures&#xD;
           involving the airway or esophagus, 2) known difficult airways, 3) patients with tenuous&#xD;
           artificial airways as determined by reviewing the CXR (chest x-ray), 4) patients with&#xD;
           abnormal blood flow pattern to the head (e.g. history of right carotid ligation or&#xD;
           interruption, known incomplete circle of Willis, known right IJ venous clots or&#xD;
           obstruction, 5) patients with left neck CVLs (central venous line), and 6) patients with&#xD;
           compromised skin integrity on neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Description of study treatments or exposures/predictors&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary physician/surgeon for each patient will be approached for permission to&#xD;
           approach the family for consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For operative patients, the study intervention will be performed following completion of&#xD;
           the procedure when the patient is emerging from anesthesia. This is a period of time&#xD;
           that often lasts 10s of minutes, has very good pain control, and is asleep. Scanning&#xD;
           will be performed when the patient is intubated, to identify landmarks, and then as soon&#xD;
           as the patient has been extubated to assess for the effect of cricoid or paratracheal&#xD;
           pressure. For patients in the MSICU, the study intervention will be performed on any&#xD;
           sedated patient who fulfills inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study first involves recording a baseline image of the neck anatomy using&#xD;
           ultrasound, which is a non-invasive, non-irradiating, non-painful imaging modality. Once&#xD;
           the baseline anatomy has been imaged, conventional cricoid pressure will be applied with&#xD;
           fingers and/or with the ultrasound probe itself and an image will be recorded. The force&#xD;
           applied to the cricoid cartilage will be 30 newtons, as determined by a thin force&#xD;
           measurement sensor (Tekscan flexiforce sensor) placed in between the patient's skin and&#xD;
           the finger (or ultrasound probe). Next, left lateral paralaryngeal pressure will be&#xD;
           applied at the level of the cricoid cartilage with fingers and/or the ultrasound probe&#xD;
           itself, and the image will again be recorded. Left lateral paralaryngeal pressure will&#xD;
           be 30 newtons, as determined by a thin force measurement sensor placed in between the&#xD;
           patient's skin and the finger (or ultrasound probe).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Definition of primary and secondary outcomes/endpoints The primary outcome is a change&#xD;
           in esophagus outer diameter following the intervention. The diameter will be assessed in&#xD;
           the AP(anteroposterior) plane. In addition, the investigator will also record whether&#xD;
           the esophageal mucosa is apposed following the application of pressure. Finally, the&#xD;
           investigator will record the position of the esophagus relative to the airway before and&#xD;
           after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Data collection methods, assessments, interventions and schedule Data will be collected&#xD;
           at the time of ultrasound and uploaded to a secure REDCap database. Patient specific&#xD;
           information will be collected, including age, gender, height, weight, primary diagnosis,&#xD;
           and size of endotracheal tube. It is possible that additional covariates may be&#xD;
           collected post hoc as necessary to complete analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Study timeline Data collection will proceed until the sample size is achieved. Interim&#xD;
           data analysis will occur when 50% of the proposed sample size has been achieved.&#xD;
