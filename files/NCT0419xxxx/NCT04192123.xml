  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is the first clinical study aimed at assessing the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      HM242-Solution and HM242-Gel after their application under occlusion on intact skin. The&#xD;
      HM242-Solution is intended for chronic wounds (e.g. pressure, venous leg and diabetic foot&#xD;
      ulcers). The HM242-Solution should be used for physical rinsing and cleansing and subsequent&#xD;
      decolonization of the wound prior to treatment with hydrogels and dressings. The HM242-Gel is&#xD;
      a hydrogel for wound bed preparation to support the healing of the skin due to cleansing,&#xD;
      moistening and subsequent decolonization and the coating of the wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in outpatient manner, adult patients who are healthy and has an&#xD;
      intact skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an prospective, open label, monocentric study. No comparative control group is&#xD;
      planned as no other preventing infection solution is commercially available at this time.&#xD;
