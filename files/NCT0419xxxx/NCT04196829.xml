    <textblock>
      the main objective of this study is to evaluate staining potential and Caries Arresting&#xD;
      Effect of silver diamine fluoride⁄potassium Iodide and silver diamine fluoride in carious&#xD;
      anterior primary teeth&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite increased attention on caries prevention, not all children receive preventive&#xD;
      treatments and large numbers still experience tooth decay. Primary care providers have had&#xD;
      little option other than invasive and costly specialist treatment in the hospital under&#xD;
      general anesthesia. In this context, there is interest in simple treatments to halt progress&#xD;
      of carious lesions after tooth decay onset. Among these simple treatments is silver diamine&#xD;
      fluoride (SDF) treatment. The major drawback to SDF treatment has been its black staining,&#xD;
      which has limited its use. To counter the staining, researchers have tested SDF treatment&#xD;
      immediately followed with application of saturated solution of potassium iodide (KI).&#xD;

    <description>The affected tooth surface will be gently cleaned and dried with cotton gauze. The gingival tissue of the tooth will be protected with petroleum jelly. An applicator will be dipped into the SDF and 3-4 mg applied to the lesion with microbrush which will be used to paint solution over carious lesion then we will wait for 1 minute till absorption . Then after SDF application KI will be applied using a separate microbrush which will be saturated by the solution and will be used to paint solution over carious lesion , no rinse will be performed and special instructions will be given following application</description>
