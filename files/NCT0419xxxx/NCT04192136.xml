  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, placebo-controlled trial with a 2x2 factorial design testing the effects of an&#xD;
      NAD+ precursor (NR) and exercise on VO2max and Si in Friedreich's Ataxia (FA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this research is to measure the effect of combination administration&#xD;
      (NR + exercise) on aerobic capacity (VO2max) in FA. A key secondary objective is to measure&#xD;
      the effect of combination administration (NR + exercise) on glucose homeostasis (Si) in FA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Friedreich's Ataxia (FA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting 1 in 50,000&#xD;
      individuals in the U.S. Currently, there is no approved treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a critical knowledge gap regarding the best ways to intervene to increase aerobic&#xD;
      capacity (VO2max on exercise testing) in FA. Exercise is the most potent known stimulus for&#xD;
      increasing muscle mass and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) capacity,&#xD;
      increasing VO2max, and increasing insulin sensitivity (Si), however, it has not been studied&#xD;
      in FA. One adaptation seen in exercised muscles is an increase in muscle nicotinamide adenine&#xD;
      dinucleotide (NAD+), a cofactor required for glycolytic and mitochondrial adenosine&#xD;
      triphosphate (ATP) production. In skeletal- and cardiac muscle-specific frataxin (FXN)&#xD;
      knock-out animals, NAD+ precursors rescued cardiac function to near-normal, additionally&#xD;
      highlighting its translational potential in FA. Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is a NAD+&#xD;
      precursor currently available as a dietary supplement (Tru Niagen ®, ChromaDex, Irvine CA)&#xD;
      that is expected to be safe and well-tolerated in adults and children. The central hypothesis&#xD;
      is that exercise + NR will increase skeletal muscle mitochondrial OXPHOS and increase muscle&#xD;
      mass to increase VO2max in FA. The investigators expect that exercise + NR will also increase&#xD;
      Si in this cohort.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The participants and the investigator team will be blinded as to the group assignment: NR vs Placebo. All collected data (e.g., questionnaires) will be coded, so initial analysis will be conducted without knowledge of the participant's group status.&#xD;
While the assignment of participants to the exercise groups will not be blinded to the participant or majority of the study team, a designated blinded technician will perform the follow-up Cardio Pulmonary Exercise Testing. Follow-Up Cardio Pulmonary Exercise Testing will be performed by a dedicated blinded study team member, an exercise technician, who will not know if the participant was assigned to an arm including the exercise intervention.</masking_description>

On aerobic training days, subjects will be given instruction on a recumbent Catrike trainer, titrated such that they spend 20 minutes at their target heart rate as determined by baseline Exercise Stress Test (EST) (60-80% of their heart rate at peak VO2) and as measured by their wearable device.&#xD;
On resistance training days, subjects will be given instructions to complete circuits of resistance exercises. Resistance training intensity (as determined by graded resistance bands) will be maintained at 60% of pre-training maximal voluntary contraction for each muscle group.</description>
