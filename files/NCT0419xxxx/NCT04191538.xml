    <textblock>
      Carpal tunnel syndrome is common, identified in 3% of the general population. Symptoms&#xD;
      including numbness and pain are due to compression of the median nerve as it travels through&#xD;
      a tunnel entering the wrist and can result in weakened grip strength and poor dexterity.&#xD;
      Despite surgical release, nerve damage due to chronic compression often cannot be completely&#xD;
      reversed, with resulting sensorimotor deficits. Postoperative electrical stimulation (ES) has&#xD;
      been well-reported to improve nerve regeneration and is currently standard of practice at our&#xD;
      institution. Investigators of this study have recently shown in an animal model that by&#xD;
      changing the timing of the ES from postoperative to preoperative, this &quot;conditioning&quot;&#xD;
      electrical stimulation (CES) significantly improves nerve regeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with severe carpal tunnel syndrome will be identified in plastic surgery clinics.&#xD;
      Patients who consent to participating will undergo baseline testing including nerve&#xD;
      conduction studies, sensory evaluation, motor testing, and patient-reported outcomes.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to three groups: i) CES, ii) postoperative ES, and iii) no&#xD;
      ES. CES will be delivered in clinic by placing a percutaneous needle alongside the median&#xD;
      nerve, and stimulation will be delivered for one hour, with patient comfort dictating the&#xD;
      voltage of stimulation. At the completion of one hour, the needle will be removed, and a&#xD;
      standard carpal tunnel release will be performed by their plastic surgeon 4-7 days later.&#xD;
      Patients will the second cohort will undergo postoperative ES immediately following their&#xD;
      carpal tunnel release, using the same stimulation parameters as CES. The third cohort will&#xD;
      receive only carpal tunnel release without stimulation.In all patients, sensory and motor&#xD;
      reinnervation, using the same testing modalities as preoperative assessment, will be&#xD;
      evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months post-operative.&#xD;

      Background: Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common compression neuropathy, with a&#xD;
      population prevalence of 3%. One quarter of these patients have severe symptoms that&#xD;
      necessitate surgical release. Our lab has previously demonstrated that electrical stimulation&#xD;
      (ES) at 20Hz for 1 hour immediately following carpal tunnel release significantly improved&#xD;
      terminal motor latency, sensory nerve conduction (1). Postoperative electrical stimulation&#xD;
      enhances regeneration locally at the site of injury(2); by contrast, the conditioning lesion&#xD;
      improves the rate of regeneration along the entire distal stump. The traditional conditioning&#xD;
      lesion refers to a purposeful crush injury delivered to a nerve prior to its transection and&#xD;
      repair. Despite 40 years of promising research at the bench, describing the conditioning&#xD;
      lesion as an effective method of promoting regeneration and reinnervation in an animal model,&#xD;
      translation to the bedside until recently has been impossible due to its injurious nature&#xD;
      (3). Our laboratory has recently identified conditioning electrical stimulation (CES) as an&#xD;
      effective method of enhancing axonal regeneration, and improve motor and sensory&#xD;
      reinnervation (4). Investigators of this study have further shown that CES improves&#xD;
      regeneration and sensorimotor reinnervation beyond that attainable by postoperative CES&#xD;
      (unpublished data). As such preoperative CES is potentially a clinically feasible method of&#xD;
      improving patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: ES delivered prior to carpal tunnel release will improve functional outcomes in&#xD;
      patients with severe carpal tunnel syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Methods: Plastic surgeons in the Division of Plastic Surgeon will identify patients&#xD;
      with severe carpal tunnel syndrome and obtain their consent to be considered for inclusion in&#xD;
      this study. Inclusion criteria includes patients aged over 18 years who have failed&#xD;
      conservative treatment, who are found to have severe carpal tunnel syndrome on nerve&#xD;
      conduction studies (thenar motor unit loss minimum two standard deviations between the mean&#xD;
      for the age group). Exclusion criteria includes patients with pre-existing peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathies. Patients will be randomized to three treatment groups: a) CES, b) postoperative&#xD;
      ES, and c) no ES. Carpal tunnel release will be performed by a plastic surgeon in the&#xD;
      standard fashion without neurolysis of the median nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinic, skin will be cleansed with alcohol and a small gauge needle will be placed&#xD;
      percutaneously in the proximal forearm, along the course of the median nerve based on known&#xD;
      surface anatomy. This needle will be connected to the cathode of an SD-9 Grass stimulator.&#xD;
      The anode will be attached to an electrical cable placed more distally on the forearm.&#xD;
      Stimulation protocol will be based on that traditionally used for postoperative ES: 20 Hz of&#xD;
      continuous stimulation for one hour, with voltage titrated to maximize voltage without&#xD;
      causing patient discomfort. At the completion of one hour, the needle will be removed. One&#xD;
      week later, carpal tunnel release will be performed by the plastic surgeon per standard&#xD;
      technique, without neurolysis of the median nerve. Among patients receiving postoperative ES,&#xD;
      the cathode will be placed next to the median nerve proximal to the carpal tunnel at the time&#xD;
      of surgical release, and electrical stimulation upon completion of the surgery will follow&#xD;
      the same stimulation parameters as outlined for CES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes include sensory testing (two-point discrimination, Semmes-Weinstein&#xD;
      monofilament, and cold threshold), motor testing (Purdue Pegboard Test), and patient-reported&#xD;
      outcomes (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire). These are well&#xD;
      established standard testing modalities for assessing recovery following carpal tunnel&#xD;
      release (5). Scores for two-point discrimination range from 1 to 20 mm with smaller distance&#xD;
      reflecting better hand sensibility. Mean score for the Purdue Pegboard Test in health control&#xD;
      is 12 pegs with a greater number reflecting better hand dexterity. Range of score for the&#xD;
      DASH questionnaire is 0 to 100 with a higher number representing greater disability. Testing&#xD;
      will be performed preoperatively to establish baseline sensorimotor function, then&#xD;
      postoperatively at 3, 6, and 12 months. Outcome measures will be analyzed using two-way&#xD;
      ANOVA, with post-hoc analysis of significant association (p&lt;0.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification: Recovery following surgical release in severe carpal tunnel is often&#xD;
      incomplete, with persistent motor and sensory deficits. While postoperative ES improves&#xD;
      regeneration, functional deficits persist; however, these studies have established ES as safe&#xD;
      and well-tolerated by patients. By changing the timing of ES from postoperative to&#xD;
      preoperative CES, animal data suggests functional outcomes can be further improved by&#xD;
      upregulating regenerative pathways to maximize the rate of axonal extension. As CES can be&#xD;
      delivered percutaneously in the clinic at the initial of initial assessment, prior to&#xD;
      surgical release, this technique is both safe, clinically feasible and may significantly&#xD;
      improve the outcomes of patients with compression neuropathies.&#xD;
