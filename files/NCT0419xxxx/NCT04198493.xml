  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adults with Down syndrome (DS) have a high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which&#xD;
      may worsen cognitive performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general population, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), the gold Standard&#xD;
      treatment for OSA, partially reverses cognitive impairment secondary to OSA. CPAP treatment,&#xD;
      however, is not regularly proposed in adults with DS and OSA. It is usually presumed both by&#xD;
      caregivers and physicians, that DS patients will not tolerate or adapt to the treatment, and&#xD;
      that they would not benefit much more from CPAP treatment. Therefore, data about the&#xD;
      feasibility and impact of CPAP treatment on cognitive function in this population is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to investigate cognitive performance in adults with DS&#xD;
      and OSA, the corresponding functional brain changes and their reversibility with CPAP&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Population Participants will be included from the Catalan Down Syndrome Foundation (FCSD).&#xD;
      After obtaining a written informed consent, approved by the ethical committee, a total of 60&#xD;
      adult subjects of both sexes with SD and without dementia will be included. Forty subjects&#xD;
      with a diagnosis of severe OSA (AHI&gt; 30) without significant comorbidities or excessive&#xD;
      daytime sleepiness (Epworth &lt;12) and 20 subjects without OSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general objective is to evaluate cognitive and/or behavioural dysfunction in adults with&#xD;
      Down syndrome that can improve with CPAP treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  By evaluating sleep, cognitive function and behaviour aspects in adults with Down&#xD;
           syndrome with and without OSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  By assessing the changes in sleep, in cognitive, behavioural function, and brain&#xD;
           connectivity measures after 6 month of treatment in subjects with DS and severe OSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the relationship between the severity of OSA (AHI, hypoxemia, sleep&#xD;
           fragmentation) and severity in cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify possible sleep and anthropometric parameters that could suggest a worsening in&#xD;
           cognitive function in subjects with DS and OSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open pilot study with randomized therapeutic intervention of parallel groups and blind&#xD;
      evaluation in neuropsychological assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with severe OSA will be randomized to i) conservative treatment (CT) or to ii) CPAP&#xD;
      and conservative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included in the study will be monitored and followed for 6 months. Patients with&#xD;
      severe OSA will perform follow up visits to monitor the objective compliance and side effects&#xD;
      of the treatment in the 1st, 3rd and 6th month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline and after 6 months of treatment, in the three groups of subjects (i) Subjects&#xD;
      without OSA, ii) Subjects with OSA and CPAP treatment, and iii) Subjects with OSA+ TC&#xD;
      treatment , it will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sleep evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjective sleep quality (Pittsburgh sleep quality index) and daytime Somnolence&#xD;
           (Epworth Sleepiness Scale) Nocturnal sleep by polysomnography (PSG) Sleep-wake pattern&#xD;
           by actigraphy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Neurocognitive function with an extensive neuropsychological battery assessing mainly&#xD;
           memory, attention and executive functions for DS population. (CAMCOG-DS, Cued Recall&#xD;
           Test (CRT), different subtests of the Barcelona Test battery: orientation in person,&#xD;
           time and space, language items (comprehension, reading and writing), verbal abstraction&#xD;
           and oculomotor praxis, cats and dogs test, Attention cancellation test, verbal fluency&#xD;
           test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Measures of cerebral functional connectivity: through measures of consistency, mutual&#xD;
           information, probability of synchronization and transfer entropy.&#xD;
