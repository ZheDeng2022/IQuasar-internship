    <textblock>
      This research study will explore the safety and efficacy of the drug, pirfenidone, in&#xD;
      patients with a diagnosis of Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS) who have an associated&#xD;
      interstitial lung disease (ILD) over a planned period of 56 weeks.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      An open-label clinical study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of administering&#xD;
      pirfeniodne for 52 weeks to subjects with HPS-ILD. Patients meeting the eligibility criteria&#xD;
      without contraindications for the study will be provided pirfenidone 2403 mg/day. Efficacy&#xD;
      will be evaluated through interval testing of pulmonary function tests, patient reported&#xD;
      outcomes, adverse events and survival. Safety will be assessed by determining adverse events,&#xD;
      hospitalizations, and all-cause mortality.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from&#xD;

             least one method with a failure rate of &lt;1% per year, during the 52 weeks of&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal,&#xD;
                  has not reached a postmenopausal state (â¥ 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with&#xD;
                  no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical&#xD;
                  sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt;1% per year include&#xD;
                  bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, established and proper use of&#xD;
                  hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine&#xD;
                  devices, and copper intrauterine devices.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
                  patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or&#xD;
                  postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For men who are not surgically sterile: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from&#xD;
             heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive measures, and agreement to refrain from&#xD;
             donating sperm, as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. With female partners of childbearing potential, men must remain abstinent or use&#xD;
                  a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a&#xD;
                  failure rate of &lt; 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 118&#xD;
                  days after the last dose of pirfenidone.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Investigational therapy, defined as any drug that has not been approved for marketing&#xD;
             for any indication in the country of the participating site including pirfenidone, at&#xD;
             the time of Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of alcohol or substance abuse in the past 2 years, at the time of Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Family or personal history of long QT syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any of the following liver function test criteria above specified limits:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Total bilirubin above the upper limit of normal (ULN), excluding patients with&#xD;
                  Gilbert's syndrome; aspartate or alanine aminotransferase (AST/SGOT or ALT/SGPT)&#xD;
                  &gt;3 Ã ULN; alkaline phosphatase &gt;2.5 Ã ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Creatinine clearance (CrCl &lt;30) mL/min, calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault&#xD;
                  formula&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Electrocardiogram (ECG) with a QTcB interval &gt;500 msec at Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior use of pirfenidone or known hypersensitivity to any of the components of study&#xD;
             treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any of the following therapies within 28 days before Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Investigational therapy, defined as any drug that has not been approved for&#xD;
                  marketing for any indication in the country of the participating site&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Fluvoxamine&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Sildenafil (daily use). Note: intermittent use for erectile dysfunction is&#xD;
