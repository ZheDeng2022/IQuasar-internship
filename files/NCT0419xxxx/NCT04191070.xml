  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to quantify the distal movement of maxillary central&#xD;
      incisors and molars achieved with infrazygomatic miniscrews in comparison with zygomatic&#xD;
      miniplate anchorage.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Premolar extraction treatment with multibracketed system and reinforced anchorage has been a&#xD;
      common modality for correcting maxillary incisor crowding or class II malocclusion due to&#xD;
      maxillary protrusion in nongrowing patients. Treatment of class II malocclusion without&#xD;
      extraction frequently requires distalization of maxillary molars into class I relation by&#xD;
      means of extraoral or intraoral forces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extra oral headgear traction is the oldest and most commonly used method to correct class II&#xD;
      buccal segment relationship by restricting the forward growth of maxilla and /or distalizing&#xD;
      the maxillary molars. This distalizes not only 1st molar but also maxillary 1st and 2nd&#xD;
      premolars via transseptal fibers. Headgear is seldom an option in adults due to aesthetics&#xD;
      and compliance concerns. The disadvantages of extra-oral appliances have motivated many&#xD;
      investigators to develop the mechanics of intraoral molar distalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various intraoral non-compliance appliances like magnets, distal jet, jones jig, pendulum&#xD;
      appliance etc. have been used to distalize the maxillary molars. However, in these&#xD;
      appliances, anchorage loss characterized by protrusion of maxillary incisors and an increase&#xD;
      in overjet is seen. Also, considerable amount of relapse occured when the distalized molars&#xD;
      were used as anchorage for the retraction of anteriors and premolar teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Absolute skeletal anchorage available 24 hours a day is an alternative method for molar&#xD;
      distalization. It provides stationary anchorage for various tooth movements without the need&#xD;
      for active patient compliance and with no undesirable side effects. Inter radicular&#xD;
      miniscrews placed between the roots limit the amount of distalization possible as they come&#xD;
      in contact with surrounding roots during tooth movement. Also, proximity of miniscrews to the&#xD;
      roots may lead to failure of screw anchorage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infrazygomatic crest is a site for miniscrew placement. It has been used successfully to&#xD;
      provide skeletal anchorage for en-masse anterior retraction, canine retraction, and intrusion&#xD;
      of maxillary posterior teeth. Anatomically, it is a pillar of cortical bone at the zygomatic&#xD;
      process of maxilla. It has two cortical plates - sinus floor and buccal cortical plate. This&#xD;
      allows for bicortical fixation and contributes to better primary stability of miniscrew. A&#xD;
      thicker bone allows greater miniscrew biting depth and more osseous contact . A new method&#xD;
      for maxillary dentition distalization with miniscrews implanted in the infrazygomatic crest&#xD;
      (IZC) region was proposed by Lin. There is no interference with tooth movement by miniscrews&#xD;
      placed here and the technique is easy to master .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Miniplates are also fixed at a distance from the root apices, and therefore do not interfere&#xD;
      in tooth movement. Their placement and removal however requires a more invasive surgical&#xD;
      procedure than those of miniscrews. Until now, there have been only few clinical studies&#xD;
      involving group distalization of posterior teeth. Thus little information is available&#xD;
      regarding the type of tooth movement that occurs, its limitations and post treatment&#xD;
      stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sugawara et al reported that the maxillary 1st molars were moved to the distal by&#xD;
      approximately 4mm at crown level by miniplate anchorage. However inconsistent sampling&#xD;
      comprising of class I, class II and class III malocclusion failed to throw light on the&#xD;
      clinical applicability and treatment planning. Also in this study 2nd molars were extracted&#xD;
      in some patients while 3rd molars were extracted in others which might have led to different&#xD;
      rates of tooth movement. This study was evaluated on lateral cephalogram in wide-open mouth&#xD;
      thus studying the tooth movement in two dimensions only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wu X et al(11) reported that mesiobuccal cusp of maxillary 1st molar crowns were moved to the&#xD;
      distal by approximately 3.15mm and distobuccal cusp by 2.8mm with miniscrews implanted in the&#xD;
      infrazygomatic crest (IZC). However, no attempt was made to evaluate the distalization effect&#xD;
      on 2nd molar. Though this study was evaluated with 3D reconstruction module from Cone Beam&#xD;
      Computed Tomography, this study did not evaluate the root resorption occuring during&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, most distalization studies have used 2-dimensional lateral cephalograms. The&#xD;
      disadvantages of this approach include confounded images caused by superimposed anatomic&#xD;
      structures and a lack of right and left side information. Although cone-beam computed&#xD;
      tomography (CBCT) has disadvantages that include higher doses of radiation, higher cost, and&#xD;
      limited availability, these limitations are overcome by the huge amount of data that is&#xD;
      provided without distortion or superimposition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No prospective randomized clinical trial has been carried out on distalization of entire&#xD;
      maxillary dentition so far. Also, to the best of our knowledge, no study to evaluate&#xD;
      distalization of entire maxillary dentition with Infrazygomatic crest miniscrews in&#xD;
      comparison with zygomatic miniplates has been conducted till now.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this randomized clinical study is to make a detailed comparison of&#xD;
      distalization of entire maxillary dentition using miniscrews implanted in infrazygomatic&#xD;
      crest with those of zygomatic miniplates in non-growing patients using Cone Beam Computed&#xD;
      Tomography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHOD Ours is a prospective, non-pharmacological, single blind, randomized&#xD;
      clinical study to make a detailed comparison of distalization of entire maxillary dentition&#xD;
      using miniscrews implanted in infrazygomatic crest with those of zygomatic miniplates in&#xD;
      non-growing patients using Cone Beam Computed Tomography. The present study will be conducted&#xD;
      in the Department of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopaedics, in conjunction with&#xD;
      Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, P.G.I.D.S., Pt. B.D.Sharma University of Health&#xD;
      Sciences, Rohtak. The study will be carried out after the institutional approval obtained&#xD;
      from the ethical committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SOURCE OF DATA The sample size consists of 42 subjects selected from the patients attending&#xD;
      the regular Out Patient Department at the Department of Orthodontics and Dentofacial&#xD;
      Orthopaedics for orthodontic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TARGET SAMPLE SIZE A sample size of 17 per group for the present study was calculated to&#xD;
      detect a clinical difference of 2.3 mm with a standard deviation of 2.3mm (effect size 1.0)&#xD;
      at 80% power and 95% confidence interval. To compensate for 20% dropouts the final sample&#xD;
      size was calculated to be 21 per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION AND DESIGN OF STUDY. The main intervention in this prospective clinical study is&#xD;
      the placement of miniscrews at infrazygomatic crest/ zygomatic miniplates after initial&#xD;
      leveling and alignment of maxillary dental arch. The study consists of 2 groups with equal&#xD;
      allocation of subjects in each group.Group 1 (G1) :- This group will receive infrazygomatic&#xD;
      crest miniscrews bilaterally.Group 2 (G2) :-This group will receive zygomatic miniplates&#xD;
      bilaterally. Selection of subjects (patients meeting selection criteria).Treatment with&#xD;
      0.022&quot; MBT preadjusted edgewise appliance. Maxillary arch will be stabilized with the help of&#xD;
      0.019&quot; Ã— 0.025&quot; stainless steel.Randomized allocation to 2 groups-G1, G2. Pretreatment&#xD;
      diagnostic records including CBCT will be taken before placement of skeletal anchorage&#xD;
      devices (infrazygomatic crest miniscrews/ zygomatic miniplates).Maxillary 3rd molars will be&#xD;
      extracted, if present. Insertion of skeletal anchorage devices under LA as per the group&#xD;
      allocated. Hooks will be soldered on archwire used for stabilizing dentition.Ni-Ti closed&#xD;
      coil spring/e-chain will be used to apply force from the skeletal anchorage device to the&#xD;
      hooks on the wire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient recalled at 4 weeks interval.Regular follow up of the patient will be done and&#xD;
      records including CBCT will be taken on achievement of class I molar relation bilaterally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBCT SPECIFICATIONS:During CBCT scan, patients will be instructed to maintain an upright&#xD;
      posture and bite on a CT guide plate so as to open the contact between maxillary and&#xD;
      mandibular dentition and stabilize the patient. The CBCT scans will be performed using CS&#xD;
      9300 CBCT machine at 85 kV, 4mA current, exposure time of 6.30 seconds, 17 x 6 FOV and voxel&#xD;
      size of 180 micro millimeter. All the scans will be performed by the same researcher.Another&#xD;
      Cone Beam Computed Tomography will be taken 2 years post retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION AND CONE BEAM COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY ANALYSIS The investigator will record the&#xD;
      patients' name, address, contact number and other relevant case history records will be&#xD;
      taken. Cephalometric radiographs and Cone Beam Computed Tomography and will be recorded&#xD;
      before placement of zygomatic miniplates,on achievement of Class I molar relation bilaterally&#xD;
      and 2 years post retention for assessment of distalization. These records will be analyzed.&#xD;
      The relevant values will be entered in a predesigned format. Soft tissue profile changes&#xD;
      between pretreatment and post treatment will be assessed on lateral cephalogram and the&#xD;
      raters- orthodontist, laypersons,patients,parents and general dentists will assess changes in&#xD;
      facial appearance on a visual analog scale with profile photographs and comparison will be&#xD;
      done between the two groups. Patient perception will be assessed using questionare rating by&#xD;
      patient regarding various parameters at 1week, 2 weeks, 1 month and 6 months after the&#xD;
      placement of zygomatic miniplate or IZC miniscrew. Quality of life will also be assessed&#xD;
      using questionnaire rating by patient at pre-treatment, mid-treatment and post treatment.&#xD;
      Occlusal status changes between pre and post treatment will be assessed using PAR index(peer&#xD;
      assessment rating between 2 groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
      INFORMED CONSENT OF THE PATIENT A valid, informed written consent of the patient or parent/&#xD;
      guardian will be obtained from the patient before registering the patient in this clinical&#xD;
      study . Patient will be informed about all the theoretical risks and benefits of the&#xD;
      intervention under test .Risks and hazards of radiation during CBCT will also be explained to&#xD;
      the patient. The patient will be given 72 hours to discuss the study with his/her family and&#xD;
      take the decision regarding participation in the study.&#xD;
