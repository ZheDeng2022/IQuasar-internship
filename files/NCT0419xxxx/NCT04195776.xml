    <textblock>
      DREAM-02 is a phase 1, open label study to evaluate different sequences of tap water douching&#xD;
      and simulated receptive anal intercourse (sRAI) in the presence of a tenofovir douche&#xD;
      designed to confer protection from Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) acquisition. DREAM-02&#xD;
      will assess the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of different sequences of administration of&#xD;
      tap water (H2O) and rectal tenofovir (TFV) douches to more accurately represent the community&#xD;
      practice of commonly using cleansing douches prior to RAI, and occasionally after RAI.&#xD;
      DREAM-02 results are essential to gain understanding of Tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP)&#xD;
      concentrations at various anatomic distances in the colon, and how those concentrations may&#xD;
      be modified by sRAI, seminal fluid, and sequence of cleansing tap water douches.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DREAM-02 is proposed as the next step in the development of an on demand,&#xD;
      behaviorally-congruent rectal tenofovir (TFV) microbicide to prevent HIV acquisition via&#xD;
      unprotected receptive anal intercourse (RAI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DREAM Program has previously established that (1) no TFV pro-drug provides significantly&#xD;
      superior colon tissue pharmacokinetics in pre-clinical models (mice and macaques), (2) a&#xD;
      single rectal TFV douche protects macaques from repeated low dose rectal simian/human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) challenge and is superior to oral daily dosing of TFV&#xD;
      disoproxil fumarate (TDF), (3) it takes only 1-3 hours for a single 125 mL hypotonic rectal&#xD;
      douche with a concentration of 5.28 mg/mL of TFV (660 mg total)to exceed by 100-fold the&#xD;
      steady-state colon tissue TFV diphosphate (TFV-DP) concentrations associated with &gt;90%&#xD;
      protection (83 femtomoles/ million [fmol/106] Mucosal Mononuclear Cells (MMC) in oral daily&#xD;
      dosing studies), and (4) DREAM behavioral survey research indicates very common use of one to&#xD;
      several rectal douches in series prior to Unprotected Receptive Anal Intercourse (URAI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DREAM-02 will assess the safety and PK of different sequences of administration of tap water&#xD;
      (H2O) and rectal TFV douches to more accurately represent the community practice of commonly&#xD;
      using cleansing douches prior to RAI, and occasionally after RAI, based on investigators'&#xD;
      DREAM behavioral survey results. DREAM-02 results are essential to gain understanding of&#xD;
      TFV-DP concentrations at various distances from the anal verge, and how those concentrations&#xD;
      may be modified by sRAI, seminal fluid, and sequence of cleansing tap water douches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sequences of douche administration are selected to evaluate the impact of either a TFV&#xD;
      rectal douche or H2O douche administered prior to, or following simulated sexual intercourse&#xD;
      with ejaculation. The first sequence of administration will replicate administration of the&#xD;
      dose that achieved the greatest tissue TFV-DP concentrations in DREAM-01 (660 mg TFV in 125&#xD;
      mL half-normal saline; TFV 5.28 mg/mL), then followed by simulated receptive anal intercourse&#xD;
      (sRAI) and administration of autologous seminal fluid via a catheter embedded in an&#xD;
      artificial phallus (Sequence A). Sequence B will evaluate the administration of the TFV&#xD;
      rectal douche administered prior to sRAI and ejaculation followed by a cleansing H2O douche.&#xD;
      Lastly, Sequence C will evaluate the administration of a cleansing H2O douche prior to sRAI&#xD;
      and ejaculation followed by the TFV rectal douche.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that douching after sex will increase the distribution of HIV&#xD;
      surrogates within the lower GI tract and may lead to a mismatch of drug and HIV surrogate&#xD;
      distribution, possibly, reducing rectal douche effectiveness. This information will be&#xD;
      essential to the design of phase 2 extended safety studies of investigators' TFV douche,&#xD;
      especially with regard to providing guidance for research participants and study counselors.&#xD;
      Since DREAM-02 and DREAM-03 will use the same TFV douche product, DREAM-02 will provide data&#xD;
      complementary to the 3 dose sequences planned for DREAM-03, and in the first arm of this&#xD;
      protocol replicates the same product/conditions as used in the highest dose escalation step&#xD;
      of DREAM-01, but with the addition of sRAI and exposure to autologous seminal fluid.&#xD;
      Therefore, bridging data from DREAM-01, DREAM-02, and DREAM-03, as well as data from other&#xD;
      DREAM Projects will inform the design and labeling of an optimal TFV douche for further&#xD;
      clinical testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that the study will take approximately six months to complete study&#xD;
      enrollment, and that each participant will be in the study for approximately six months from&#xD;
      the time of screening.&#xD;
