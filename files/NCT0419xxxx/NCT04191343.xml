    <textblock>
      This is an open, single-arm, single-center, prospective phase II clinical study to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of first-line tripletrumab combined with GEMOX chemotherapy in&#xD;
      patients with advanced biliary tract tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selected patients will receive the following treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Triplel monoclonal antibody (240mg, intravenous drip, d1, q3w);Combined with gemcitabine&#xD;
      (1000mg/m2, intravenous drip, d1, d8, q3w) and oxaliplatin (100mg/m2, intravenous drip, d1,&#xD;
      q3w) until the disease progresses or an intolerable adverse reaction occurs (the maximum&#xD;
      treatment time is 2 years).&#xD;
