  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of monoclonal antibodies (MA) either alone or as part of chemoimmunotherapy in&#xD;
      oncology, benign and malignant hematology is expanding. Of the 17 therapeutic MAs approved in&#xD;
      2017 by FDA, 50% of them are indicated for hematologic and oncologic condition. With&#xD;
      increasing number of approved agents, therapeutic MAs have become one of the fastest growing&#xD;
      areas in the management of benign and malignant hematologic condition. Advancement of&#xD;
      recombinant technology allows development of partially or fully humanized new agents. Despite&#xD;
      this, they still carry significant risk of immune and non-immune mediated adverse events.&#xD;
      Most of the therapeutic monoclonal antibody related adverse events (MCAAE) The severity of&#xD;
      reaction is variable, ranging from mild involvement of single organ to severe and&#xD;
      life-threatening reactions requiring hospitalization or even resulting in death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even for mild infusion reactions, where re-initiation of infusion is possible, there is&#xD;
      resultant delay in delivery of infusions, distress to patients, and additional utilization of&#xD;
      health care resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to unpredictability of standard infusion reaction (SIR), efforts have been focused on&#xD;
      premedication to decreasing the incidence and severity of infusion reaction. Most&#xD;
      institutions have protocols using corticosteroid, acetaminophen and antihistamine as part of&#xD;
      their premedication protocols. This has reduced but not eliminated standard infusion&#xD;
      reactions. Most recently, mast cell stabilizers are being added to standard protocols to&#xD;
      further reduce the incidence and severity of standard infusion reactions with variable&#xD;
      anecdotal success without formal study. Of all the monoclonal antibodies, only Daratumumab&#xD;
      has been evaluated using this strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to evaluate the efficacy of mast cell stabilizer Montelukast (SINGULAIR) 10&#xD;
      mg in decreasing the SIR in patients receiving therapeutic MAs either alone or as part of&#xD;
      chemoimmunotherapy in hematologic condition. The MAs being studied includes: Blinatumomab&#xD;
      (BLINCYTO, Amgen Inc.), Daratumumab (DARZALEX, Janssen Biotech, Inc.), Elotuzumab (EMPLICIT,&#xD;
      Bristol-Myers Squibb Company), Gemtuzumab (MYLOTARG, Pfizer Inc.), Obinutuzumab (GAZYVA,&#xD;
      Genentech USA, Inc.), and Rituximab (RITUXAN, Genentech US); The investigators postulate that&#xD;
      10 mg of Montelukast, when given in addition to standard premedication, will lead to decrease&#xD;
      in incidence of MA associated SIR, shorter infusion time and decrease use of additional&#xD;
      health care resources&#xD;

      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase II single arm open label study evaluating 10 mg Montelukast given at least 2&#xD;
      hours prior to infusion of monoclonal antibody in addition to standard premedication.&#xD;
      Monoclonal antibodies being evaluated include those commonly used to treat hematologic and&#xD;
      oncologic malignancies like (Blinatumomab, Daratumumab, Elotuzumab, Gemtuzumab, Obinutuzumab,&#xD;
      and Rituximab).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arms/Intervention; Study subjects will be given 10 mg of Montelukast to be orally&#xD;
      self-administered at least 2 hours prior to beginning of chemotherapy section Standard&#xD;
      premedication will be administered according to institution protocol&#xD;
