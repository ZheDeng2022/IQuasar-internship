      This non-randomized, open-label study will address the following research aims in People who&#xD;
      inject drugs (PWID):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the feasibility and acceptability of the Expanding PrEP Implementation in&#xD;
           Communities of PWID (EPIC-P) intervention among high-risk PWID.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the preliminary efficacy of the EPIC-P intervention in terms of increasing&#xD;
           adherence to PrEP and primary HIV prevention among high-risk PWID.&#xD;

      A non-randomized, open-label design will be utilized to test the feasibility, acceptability,&#xD;
      and preliminary efficacy of the Expanding PrEP Implementation in Communities of PWID (EPIC-P)&#xD;
      intervention among high-risk people who inject drugs (PWID) with opioid dependence (N=100).&#xD;
      Since the aim of this pilot study is to establish whether the EPIC-P intervention is&#xD;
      feasible/acceptable among at-risk PWID in a community-based setting, proposed is a&#xD;
      non-comparative design. With the hopes to target PWID who are not linked with existing harm&#xD;
      reduction services, proposed is to recruit participants using respondent driven sampling&#xD;
      (RDS), a chain referral method with demonstrated success in recruiting hard-to-reach&#xD;
      populations. Initial RDS participants, called &quot;seeds,&quot; will be carefully recruited from the&#xD;
      community where the study team leadership have built a well-established relationship.&#xD;
      Participants enrolled in the study will be assessed at baseline and will be followed for 9&#xD;
      months (with follow-up assessments at 3- and 6-months) by trained research assistants.&#xD;
      Importantly, structured interviews will be conducted at follow-up visits to examine the&#xD;
      barriers and facilitators and feedback about optimal implementation of the EPIC-P&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

    <description>The acceptability will be assessed using a series of eight items acceptability rating profile. We will use a 5-point Likert scale (0= strongly disagree to 4= strongly agree) to rate the extend to which they agreed with each acceptability statement. A mean intervention acceptability score will be calculated with higher values indicating greater acceptability.</description>
