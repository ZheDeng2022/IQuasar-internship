           including evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cabozantinib will be administered orally, once daily&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nivolumab will be administered intravenously, every two weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The target enrollment for this study is 35 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved cabozantinib or nivolumab&#xD;

             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has tumor in contact with, invading, or encasing major blood vessels&#xD;
             or radiographic evidence of significant cavitary pulmonary lesions.&#xD;

                  investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has an active infection requiring IV antibiotics&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any active, known, or suspected autoimmune disease. Participants with type I diabetes&#xD;
             mellitus, hypothyroidism only requiring hormone replacement, skin disorders (such as&#xD;
             vitiligo, psoriasis, or alopecia) not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not&#xD;
             expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger (e.g. celiac disease) are&#xD;
             permitted to enroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a medical condition that requires chronic systemic steroid therapy or on&#xD;
             any other form of immunosuppressive medication. Adrenal replacement steroid disease&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The participant is known to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),&#xD;
             HepBsAg, or HCV RNA. HIV-positive participants with non-detectable viral loads on&#xD;
             combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for&#xD;
             pharmacokinetic interactions with cabozantinib and nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has received a live vaccine within 28 days prior to the first dose of&#xD;
             trial treatment and while participating in the trial. Examples of live vaccines&#xD;
             include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella,&#xD;
             varicella/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid vaccine. The use of the&#xD;
             inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine (Fluzone®) is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating females are excluded from this study because cabozantinib and&#xD;
             nivolumab are agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.&#xD;
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with cabozantinib and nivolumab, breastfeeding&#xD;
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with cabozantinib and nivolumab. These&#xD;
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sexually active fertile subjects and their partners must agree to use medically&#xD;
             accepted methods of contraception (eg, barrier methods, including male condom, female&#xD;
             condom, or diaphragm with spermicidal gel) during the course of the study and&#xD;
             following treatment. Women of childbearing potential receiving nivolumab will be&#xD;
             instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 5 months after the last dose of&#xD;
             nivolumab. Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually active with WOCBP will be&#xD;
             instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 7 months after the last dose of&#xD;
             nivolumab. Contraception must be used for 4 months after last dose of cabozantinib.&#xD;
