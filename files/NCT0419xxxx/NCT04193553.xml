  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to compare the efficacy of lenvatinib plus Best Supportive Care&#xD;
      versus Placebo plus Best Supportive Care in the treatment of patients with advanced GIST,&#xD;
      after failure of imatinib and sunitinib.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Even though the prognosis of advanced GIST has been tremendously improved by the introduction&#xD;
      of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, the vast majority of patients will develop secondary&#xD;
      resistance to these agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapeutic options of patients with advanced GIST with resistance (or intolerance) to&#xD;
      imatinib and sunitinib remain then very limited and prognosis of patients are very poor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nilotinib has an inferior activity in first line setting as compared to imatinib. Sorafenib&#xD;
      has been evaluated in off-label and compassionate use studies with a median PFS close to 3 to&#xD;
      4 months, and a median overall survival close to 9 months with few prolonged tumor control&#xD;
      and limited availability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regorafenib was tested in a phase II and a randomized phase III trial (GRID) in this setting&#xD;
      , and provided a significant PFS advantage with no significant improvement in OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no recognized standard options in patients whose tumors progress after 3 or more&#xD;
      TKIs. The recently updated guidelines from ESMO in 2014, included the reintroduction of&#xD;
      imatinib in an attempt to control the progression of the sensitive cell clones, and on the&#xD;
      basis of the results of the RIGHT study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is therefore a situation with a clear unmet medical need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lenvatinib is a broad spectrum TKI targeting oncogenes KIT and RET and receptor tyrosine&#xD;
      kinases, PDGFRA, VEGFR 1-3 and FGFR 1-4. It has demonstrated activity in iodine resistant&#xD;
      metastatic thyroid cancers. Whether lenvatinib would be a useful agent in patients with GIST&#xD;
      is not known but there is a rationale to investigate its activity in patients with advanced&#xD;
      GIST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, we propose to analyze the antitumor activity of lenvatinib in patients&#xD;
      with GIST failing to at least imatinib and sunitinib in a randomized setting, vs placebo.&#xD;
