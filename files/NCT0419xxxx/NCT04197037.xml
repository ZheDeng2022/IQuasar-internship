    <textblock>
      Clozapine is the &quot;gold standard&quot; antipsychotic drug for the treatment of resistant&#xD;
      schizophrenia or resistant psychosis. Despite the high rates of good clinical response, the&#xD;
      potential side effects can limit its use. Sialorrhea or excessive salivation is a side effect&#xD;
      that occurs in 30-80% of people who receive this treatment and it can cause a decrease in&#xD;
      self-esteem and feeling of security, greater social isolation and increase stigma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to measure the prevalence of sialorrhea in inpatients and&#xD;
      outpatients treated with clozapine and its consequences on the quality of life of people who&#xD;
      are receiving this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 129 patients over 18 years of age in treatment with clozapine will be recruited&#xD;
      from different units of the Institute of Neuropsychiatry and Addictions (INAD) of the Parc de&#xD;
      Salut Mar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sialorrhea will be evaluated by the nursing team with the Nocturnal Hypersalivation Rating&#xD;
      Scale (NHRS), the Scale of Frequency and severity of salivation and the scale of impact on&#xD;
      the quality of life. Also sociodemographic variables such as age, date of birth, race, date&#xD;
      of diagnosis and clinical variables such as diagnosis, dose of clozapine and other treatments&#xD;
      prescribed will be collected.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic drug considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; in the treatment&#xD;
      of resistant psychosis and also in patients who have had adverse effects with others drugs&#xD;
      previously indicated as first line. It has been described that almost two thirds of patients&#xD;
      who do not respond to first and second generation antipsychotics respond to clozapine&#xD;
      treatment. Despite its effectiveness in positive, negative symptoms and the risk of suicide,&#xD;
      clozapine presents a risk of adverse effects ranging from potentially dangerous ones. such as&#xD;
      agranulocytosis or myocarditis, to others that are considered mild but that they can&#xD;
      compromise the quality of life of patients and non-compliance. One of these mild, but&#xD;
      extremely annoying, side effects is sialorrhea. The prevalence of sialorrhea secondary to&#xD;
      clozapine reported by different studies range from 30% to 80% and it seems to be a&#xD;
      dose-dependent relationship. This great variability observed in the studies probably has to&#xD;
      do with the tendency that clinicians have to underestimate this side effect. In addition, the&#xD;
      presence of sialorrhea can impact negatively in the subject causing a decrease in self-esteem&#xD;
      and feeling of security, greater social isolation and an increase in stigma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the consequences that sialorrhea has on the quality of life perceived by people in&#xD;
      Clozapine treatment and the relationship with possible therapeutic abandonment, in addition&#xD;
      to the low systematic evaluation of this side effect, it is considered relevant to establish&#xD;
      a systematic evaluation of clozapine induced sialorrhea in the different mental health&#xD;
      devices of our center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure the prevalence of sialorrhea in patients treated with clozapine and its impact on&#xD;
      subjective perception of quality of life. The possible relationship between the Clozapine&#xD;
      dose and sialorrhea severity, as well as severity prediction will be evaluated based on the&#xD;
      clinical and sociodemographic variables collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The prevalence of sialorrhea in people treated with clozapine is at least 30% of&#xD;
           patients receiving this antipsychotic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The presence of sialorrhea is directly related to a worse perception of the perceived&#xD;
           quality of life in patients treated with clozapine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The presence of sialorrhea is directly related to the prescribed dose of clozapine,&#xD;
           presenting a dose-dependence relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. There is an association between the total daily dose of clozapine and the severity of&#xD;
           sialorrhea in patients treated with clozapine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A quasi-experimental study will be carried out to measure the prevalence of sialorrhea in&#xD;
      patients treated with clozapine in different Units of the INAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate the sample size, people with the diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective&#xD;
      disorder will be collected in the Units above mentioned in 2018, it was a sample size of 250.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on that the incidence of refractory schizophrenia is around 30% to 50% of cases, the&#xD;
      number of patients potentially candidates to be treated with clozapine would be 125.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final sample size has been calculated with the following tool available on the web&#xD;
      http://.fisterra.com/mbe/investia/9samples/9samples.asp, with a 95% confidence interval and&#xD;
      an accuracy of 3%, expecting sialorrhea in 30% of the cases and including a proportion of&#xD;
      losses around 15%. The final sample will be 129 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nursing team will be responsible to inform the patients about the study, to enroll them and&#xD;
      to obtain informed consent. Also they will administer 3 clinical scales previously used in&#xD;
      hypersalivation studies (Maher et al. 2016; Wai Hong Man, Jantine Colen-de Koning, Peter&#xD;
      Schulte and Ingrid van Haelst 2017) through the direct observation of the sialorrhea&#xD;
      presented by the patient with stable treatment with clozapine. The scales will be&#xD;
      administered only once and there won't be any longitudinal follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scales are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The Nocturnal Hypersalivation Rating Scale (NHRS): A validated scale of 5 items used to&#xD;
           assess the severity of nocturnal salivation. Scores range from the non-presence of&#xD;
           nocturnal salivation to wake up a minimum of 3 times during the night due to&#xD;
           hypersalivation (Spivak et al. 1997).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Drooling Severity and Frequency Scale (DSFS): A validated scale to evaluate the severity&#xD;
           of daytime sialorrhea (Rashnoo and Daniel 2015). Scores range from no presence of&#xD;
           sialorrhea to a profuse sialorrhea where saliva wets the body or even objects and&#xD;
           furniture (saliva falls on the table when the person is sitting) based on a 5-point&#xD;
           scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Both severity and frequency scores are added to give a final score of the daytime&#xD;
           sialorrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Impact on the quality of life scale: It is a 5-point scale that range from no impact on&#xD;
           quality of life to a major problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, sociodemographic variables such as age, date of birth, race, date of diagnosis,&#xD;
      as well as variables clinics such as diagnosis, years of disease evolution, total daily dose&#xD;
      of Clozapine treatment and other prescribed treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All this information will be included in an anonymous database (subjects will be identified&#xD;
      by a study code and the database will not include personal data).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistic analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data analysis will be carried out using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences&#xD;
      (SPSS statistical program), version 25.0. The distribution of the sociodemographic and&#xD;
      clinical characteristics of the sample will be analyzed using descriptive statistics.&#xD;
      Likewise, to describe the possible linear associations between quantitative variables related&#xD;
      to clozapine and sialorrhea will use the coefficient of correlation. Finally, an exploratory&#xD;
      regression analysis will be done to predict the severity of the sialorrhea based on clinical&#xD;
      and sociodemographic variables. The limitations of the study will be the foreseeable studies&#xD;
      of quasi-experimental studies: that do not allow establishing cause-effect relationships&#xD;
      between variables or calculate incidence.&#xD;
