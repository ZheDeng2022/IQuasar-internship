  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury(AKI) is a common, severe emergency case in clinics,especially severe AKI&#xD;
      ,which is associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Effect of routine therapy is&#xD;
      limited and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC)are considered a new therapy for treating severe&#xD;
      acute kidney injury. Patients will be randomized to receive intravenous infusion of MSC, or&#xD;
      placebo control. This trial is to investigate whether MSC can improve renal recovery and&#xD;
      mortality of patients with AKI.&#xD;
