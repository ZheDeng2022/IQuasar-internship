  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open-label, study of BP1001-A in participants with advanced or recurrent&#xD;
      solid tumors. The dose escalation phase will determine the safety and the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) of BP1001-A as a single agent. After the MTD or&#xD;
      MAD of BP1001-A is established, the dose expansion phase will commence and determine the&#xD;
      safety, toxicity and response of BP1001-A in combination with paclitaxel.&#xD;
