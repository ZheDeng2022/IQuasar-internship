      Immunotherapy combined with anti-angiogenic therapy can achieve better results in patients&#xD;
      with second-line and above small cell lung cancer&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Through this study, it was found that Anlotinib combined with Sintilimab has a better&#xD;
      survival benefit. At the same time, genetic analysis and immunohistochemical methods have&#xD;
      been used to predict the predictive value of targeted therapy combined with Sintilimab.&#xD;
