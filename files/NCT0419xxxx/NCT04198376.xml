  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to comparatively evaluate the advantages of LCT with SCTG over MCAT&#xD;
      with SCTG for coverage of deep isolated mandibular anterior recession.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gingival recession is defined as the displacement of the soft tissue margin apical to the&#xD;
      cementoenamel junction.Different predisposing anatomic features can result in recession such&#xD;
      as position and anatomy of teeth in the dental arch, bony dehiscence, thickness of the&#xD;
      alveolar mucosa, muscle pull, orthodontic treatment, thin gingival biotype, buccal prominence&#xD;
      of teeth, lack of keratinized tissue, high frenum attachment, or patient related factors such&#xD;
      as vigorous brushing or chronic gingival inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a common finding in patient with a high standard of oral hygiene as well as in&#xD;
      periodontally untreated populations with poor oral hygiene.The migration of the marginal&#xD;
      tissue to an apical position may lead to esthetic concern, dentin hypersensitivity, root&#xD;
      caries, and cervical wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mandibular gingival recession defects present significant therapeutic challenges such as&#xD;
      shallow vestibular depth, high frenal attachment, thin soft tissue biotypes leading to thin&#xD;
      coronally advanced flaps, and thin often dehisced labial bone.Due to these factors the&#xD;
      mandibular sites suffers strong and constant tension in comparison to the maxilla, hence&#xD;
      there is lack of predictability in the mandibular sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various surgical techniques have been proposed for the treatment of isolated mandibular&#xD;
      recessions including the use of fully or partially epithelized free gingival grafts (FGG) or&#xD;
      sub epithelial connective tissue graft in conjunction with various types of flaps eg:&#xD;
      (envelope, coronally or laterally positioned flap, double pedicle flap (DPF) or tunnelling&#xD;
      (TUN) alone or combined with laterally positioned pedicle flaps (LPPF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronally advanced flap (CAF) +connective tissue graft (CTG) is considered as the gold&#xD;
      standard treatment in reducing or eliminating gingival recession. Tunnel technique was first&#xD;
      introduced by Allen in 19949, and its modifications by Zabalegui in 199910, Modified&#xD;
      Coronally Advanced Tunnel (MCAT) by Azzi et al 2002 and Microsurgical CAT by Zuhr 2007.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, in deep isolated mandibular recessions located in the anterior area, tension free&#xD;
      coronal displacement of the flap can be extremely difficult and may result in decreased&#xD;
      vestibular depth and flap dehiscence due to increased flap tension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore a new clinical approach of The Laterally Closed Tunnel (LCT), specifically designed&#xD;
      for deep isolated anterior Mandibular Millers class I, II and III recession has been&#xD;
      introduced to predictably cover recession and minimize the risk for post operative&#xD;
      complications caused by unfavourable anatomical situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The important aspect of LCT is the wide mesiodistal and apical mobilisation of the tunnel&#xD;
      which enables tension free lateral movement of the flap margins to cover the graft and the&#xD;
      recession. The tension free lateral movement and the passive lateral closure of the tunnel&#xD;
      margins maybe advantageous in the treatment of isolated deep recessions located in areas with&#xD;
      inserting frenula or shallow vestibule, which makes a coronal tension free advancement of the&#xD;
      flap extremely difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beside the tension free flap preparation, the use of SCTG plays a key role in increasing flap&#xD;
      thickness and blood clot stability and in providing the cells needed for soft tissue&#xD;
      regeneration and keratinization.&#xD;

GM.Zero points=failure of root coverage (gingival margin apical or equal to the baseline recession); 3points=partial root coverage; 6 points=CRC MTC.Zero points=irregular gingival margin (doesnot follow the CEJ); 1 point=proper marginal contour/scalloped gingival margin (follows the CEJ).&#xD;
STT.Zero points=scar formation and/or keloid-like appearance; 1 point=absence of scar or keloid formation MGJ.Zero points=MGJ not aligned with the MGJ of adjacent teeth; 1 point=MGJ aligned with the MGJ of adjacent teeth.&#xD;

PI=0 score given when the gingival area of the tooth surface is literally free of plaque.&#xD;
PI=1 represents the situation where the gingival area is covered with a thin film of plaque which is not visible,but which is made visible PI=2 score given when the deposit is visible PI=3 is reserved for the heavy (1-2mm.thick) accumulation of soft matter.</description>
