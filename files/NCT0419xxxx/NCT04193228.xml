  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Distal Hereditary Motor Neuropathy (dHMN) is a rare inherited neuromuscular disorder. It is&#xD;
      characterised by distal weakness. The condition usually manifests in the second decade of&#xD;
      life and progresses slowly. Though patients usually have a normal lifespan it is a disabling&#xD;
      condition and most eventually need aids to walk. In order to improve walking quality in&#xD;
      patient with dHMN, research is needed to understand the impairments that lead to altered gait&#xD;
      patterns, and to develop interventions to correct walking gait conservatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this proposed trial our goal is to explore the relationships between muscle structure,&#xD;
      function and gait patterns for people with Distal Hereditary Motor Neuropathy. Over 12&#xD;
      months, muscle changes in dHMN are going to be observed in terms of structure and function&#xD;
      using MRI, myometry and 3D motion analysis. In addition, the effect of a 16 weeks exercises&#xD;
      program on muscle structure and function in dHMN is going to be measured by the same&#xD;
      observational methods. To address walking gait directly in dHMN, gait patterns with and&#xD;
      without wearing carbon fibre ankle foot orthoses (AFO)will be measured using 3D motion&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;

      Objectives: The primary objective (objective 1) is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. explore the natural history of muscle structure and function in Distal Hereditary Motor&#xD;
           Neuropathy (dHMN) over one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to ascertain relationships between intramuscular fat fraction (measured by MRI), muscle&#xD;
           volume, isokinetic muscle strength (measured by dynamometry) and moments/power&#xD;
           generation (measured by 3D gait analysis) (objective 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to explore the effect of bilateral carbon fibre ankle foot orthoses (AFO) on the&#xD;
           kinetics and kinematics of gait of people with DHMN (measured by 3D gait analysis)&#xD;
           (objective 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to explore the effect of resistance training of the ankle muscles in people with ankle&#xD;
           muscle strength over grade 4 MRC scale on muscle structure, function, and gait patterns&#xD;
           (objective 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of trial: A prospective cohort study in adult patients with dHMN with a single UK site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design and methods: This study (participants with dHMN and control participants) is&#xD;
      proposed to take place over 3 years in one site in the UK (NHNN). Participants with dHMN aged&#xD;
      over 18 for potential enrolment in the study will be identified through existing inherited&#xD;
      neuropathy cohort clinics at NHNN and healthy control participants will be invited. If they&#xD;
      show interest in participating, they will be given the relevant Patient Information Sheets&#xD;
      and Informed Consent Forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1&amp;2: dHMN participants will undergo the following measures: MRI scans of the legs,&#xD;
      isokinetic strength and power measures of the lower limb using the HUMAC Norm dynamometer,3D&#xD;
      motion analysis to capture kinetic and kinematic data of complete gait cycles. Clinical&#xD;
      assessments will be undertaken to measure: gait speed and endurance, joint range of motion,&#xD;
      foot posture, pain and sensory impairment. For direct comparison of gait deviations, twenty&#xD;
      age and gender matched health controls will also be recruited to undergo the same measures.&#xD;
      Scans, dynamometry and clinical measures will be repeated after one year to explore the&#xD;
      natural history of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3: The dHMN participants recruited for objective 1 will undergo additional gait&#xD;
      analysis: wearing just shoes (control condition), wearing their own prescribed orthoses&#xD;
      (where appropriate), and wearing bilateral carbon fibre AFOs. The order of wearing or not&#xD;
      wearing the AFOs will be randomised to account for learning and/or fatigue effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 4: The participants from objective 1 will be invited to participate in the strength&#xD;
      training study and will be screened to see if they meet the inclusion criteria. The primary&#xD;
      criteria will be that at least one of the major muscle groups of the ankle, dorsiflexors or&#xD;
      plantarflexors, will score over 4/5 on the MRC scale. There might be a need for recruiting&#xD;
      more participants if less than 10 from objective 1 participants met the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
      Up to 15 participants will be prescribed a home based, resistance training trial for 16&#xD;
      weeks, supervised by the PhD candidate through weekly phone calls and monthly monitoring&#xD;
      through an app, and progression visits. Response to training will be analysed by: MRI scans,&#xD;
      myometry, and 3D motion analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial duration per participant: 16 months Estimated total trial duration: 36 months Planned&#xD;
      trial sites: The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery (NHNN), UCLH NHS Foundation&#xD;
      Trust.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total number of participants planned: 20 participants with dHMN and 20 matching control&#xD;
      participants will be recruited for objective 1. Participates with dHMN will be invited to&#xD;
      participate for objective 2 and 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main inclusion/exclusion criteria: The main disease to be investigated is dHMN. The key&#xD;
      inclusion criteria are: adult patients aged 18 or above with clinically proven dHMN; patients&#xD;
      who are able to complete calf and thigh myometry, able to walk for 10 minutes without walking&#xD;
      aids, and have no contraindication to MRI scanning. For objective 4, at least one of the&#xD;
      major muscle groups of the ankle, dorsiflexors or plantarflexors, will score over 4/5 on the&#xD;
      MRC scale. The key exclusion criteria are: patients having undergone lower limbs surgery in&#xD;
      the year prior to the trial enrolment or planned to have lower limb surgery in the 16 months&#xD;
      of the study; bilateral arthrodesis; participants having another medical condition which&#xD;
      precludes them having an MRI scan; patients with a known diagnosis of another neurological&#xD;
      disease. Control participants must have no known neuromuscular disease, have no&#xD;
      contraindication to MRI scanning, be able to complete calf and thigh myometry and 3D gait&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
