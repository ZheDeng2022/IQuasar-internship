  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the prospective study is to assess the feasibility of a screening and baseline&#xD;
      measurement protocol that is planned for a main study (PRÄP-GO) in a collective of 30&#xD;
      patients ageing 70+ scheduled for elective surgery. Comprehensive geriatric assessment scores&#xD;
      and modified Fried frailty phenotype component evaluation are performed in all patients at&#xD;
      baseline before elective surgery. The assessment of cognitive tests is conducted with a&#xD;
      battery of neuropsychological tests, computer-based tests from the Cambridge&#xD;
      Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery [CANTAB®] and non-computer based tests. Frailty&#xD;
      scores from 0 to 5 (i.e., 1 point for each component; 0 = best to 5 = worst) represent robust&#xD;
      (0), pre-frail (1-2), and frail (3-5) health status. 10 patients without Frailty, 10 patients&#xD;
      with Pre-Frailty and 10 patients with Frailty should be analyzed in this study and receive&#xD;
      further comprehensive geriatric assessment testing up to seven days after surgery/discharge&#xD;
      (before 7 postoperative days).&#xD;
