  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, phase 1, single arm study intended to determine the&#xD;
      optimal target dose and safety of bb2121 in subjects with HR (R-ISS Stage III per IMWG&#xD;
      criteria) NDMM. Subjects should have received 3 Cycles of standard induction therapy prior to&#xD;
      undergoing leukapheresis procedure to collect autologous mononuclear cells for manufacture of&#xD;
      the drug product (bb2121). Following manufacture of the drug product, subjects will receive&#xD;
      fourth cycle of induction therapy followed by lymphodepleting therapy with fludarabine and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide prior to bb2121 infusion. Maintenance therapy is recommended for all&#xD;
      subjects who have received bb2121 infusion and should be initiated upon adequate bone marrow&#xD;
      recovery or from 90-day post-bb2121 infusion, whichever is later.&#xD;
