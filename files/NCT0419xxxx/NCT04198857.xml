      Adequate control and management of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) during pregnancy is&#xD;
      critical to mitigate its short- and long-term health consequences in women and their children&#xD;
      and may serve as a key strategy to curb the escalating type 2 diabetes epidemic in low- and&#xD;
      middle-income countries (LMICs). Taking a user-centered design approach, here the study&#xD;
      investigators propose to develop a culturally-appropriate smartphone application (app) to&#xD;
      support self-management of GDM, and additionally, test its usability and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy, among patients in a sub-urban hospital setting in Nepal. App-based lifestyle&#xD;
      interventions for GDM management are not common, especially in LMICs where its prevalence is&#xD;
      rapidly increasing, and as such, study findings will have important public health relevance&#xD;
      for a broader population. Additionally, we propose to pilot the first prenatal telemedicine&#xD;
      program in Dhulikhel Hospital and test its implementation feasibility and acceptability among&#xD;
      patient and healthcare providers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is rapidly increasing worldwide,&#xD;
      particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Tight glycemic control via diet and&#xD;
      lifestyle modification is critical to treating GDM and preventing its adverse health&#xD;
      consequences, including increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), in women and their children.&#xD;
      However, in many resource-limited countries including Nepal, time for diet/lifestyle&#xD;
      counseling often competes with other components of antenatal care. Mobile health (mHealth)&#xD;
      technology can be leveraged to promote healthy behaviors, and support self-management and&#xD;
      treatment of GDM, but this approach has not been tried previously in any LMICs. Taking a&#xD;
      user-centered design approach, here the study investigators propose to develop a&#xD;
      culturally-appropriate smartphone application (app) to support self-management of GDM (mGDM),&#xD;
      and test its usability and preliminary efficacy, among patients in a tertiary level,&#xD;
      university hospital of Kathmandu University, Nepal. Based on the Social Cognitive Theory&#xD;
      framework for behavior change, this app will assist in self-management of GDM by increasing&#xD;
      the patient's knowledge and self-efficacy to adhere to the recommended diet and physical&#xD;
      activity regimens. The app will also help clinicians by generating easily digestible visual&#xD;
      displays of patient data and behaviors, which can aid in their clinical decision-making and&#xD;
      counseling. In the requirements gathering phase, 6 GDM patients will be recruited into a&#xD;
      focus group to view paper prototypes and provide feedback on its features and functions.&#xD;
      Additional questions will be asked about their perceived barriers, facilitators, and&#xD;
      strategies for lifestyle modification. Key informant interviews will also be conducted with 5&#xD;
      clinicians (gynecologists, dietician, physical therapist) and 3 family members, asking them&#xD;
      to provide feedback on the mGDM prototype, especially pertaining to the usefulness and format&#xD;
      of the graphic summaries of patient data. After revising paper prototypes and developing the&#xD;
      first digital prototype, six additional patients with GDM will be recruited for two rounds of&#xD;
      usability testing including think-aloud protocol and focus group discussions. Final prototype&#xD;
      will be developed following an iterative process of product design and user testing. After&#xD;
      developing the app, the investigators will recruit 60 women who are newly diagnosed with GDM,&#xD;
      and randomly assign them to one of two treatment conditions: either (A) standard care +&#xD;
      telemonitoring alone, or (B) mGDM app + standard care + telemonitoring, from 30 weeks of&#xD;
      gestation to delivery. All participants will receive bio-monitoring devices for the&#xD;
      self-monitoring of blood pressure and blood glucose. Although the fundamental elements of the&#xD;
      telemonitoring support are the same between the two groups, patients in the app group will be&#xD;
      able to leverage the technological features in the app to aid with self-monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to 60 women with GDM, we will also be enrolling 100 women who do not have GDM but&#xD;
      failed the glucose challenge test (GCT) in the first screening step of the 2-step diagnostic&#xD;
      test for GDM. Women who had high GCT (thus failed the GCT screening) but are not diagnosed&#xD;
      GDM are also at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes and are also recommended to&#xD;
      adopt diet/lifestyle modification in our study site (Dhulikhel Hospital). In addition to&#xD;
      randomizing 60 GDM women in a clinical trial, we will also randomize 100 high GCT women to&#xD;
      one of two treatment conditions: either (A) standard care alone or (B) mGDM app + standard&#xD;
      care, for the rest of their pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Block randomization will be utilized to split GDM patients and high GCT patients evenly&#xD;
      amongst the two treatment groups. The 60 GDM women will be randomized into two groups of 30.&#xD;
      The high GCT women will be randomized into two groups of 50. Patients in Treatment A will&#xD;
      receive standard care alone, regardless of diagnosis. Patients in Treatment B will receive&#xD;
      mGDM app + standard care. All women diagnosed with GDM will receive telemonitoring in&#xD;
      addition to their standard care, whereas women diagnosed high GCT only will not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this proof-of-concept trial, feasibility outcomes will be app usage, self-monitoring&#xD;
      adherence, app usability and acceptability and the telemonitoring feasibility outcomes will&#xD;
      be patient engagement and the validity of self-measurements by the patients. Exploratory&#xD;
      treatment outcomes will be glycemic control measures at 6 weeks postpartum, neonatal&#xD;
      birthweight and neonatal glucose levels, neonatal APGAR score, NICU admittance, insulin&#xD;
      prescription in pregnancy, hypertensive disorder in pregnancy, gestational weight gain and&#xD;
      labor induction and caesarean delivery. Findings from the proposed study will empirically&#xD;
      inform a future randomized control trial that will be fully powered to test the efficacy and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of the mGDM app in improving treatment outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>Standard care for GDM will be modifying diet&amp; exercise and/or medication use. Participants will have consultations with a dietitian and a physical therapist to develop a diet and physical activity plan based on pre-pregnancy weight and disease severity. In addition to verbal information about managing GDM with diet and physical activity, patients will be provided with leaflets and brochures. As per the standard care protocol, GDM patients will be asked to visit the OPD for glucose testing every two weeks, and after each testing, blood glucose levels will be recorded in paper booklets assigned to each patient. In addition, the women will be provided with a glucometer and a blood pressure monitor machine. Participants will be taught to use these devices for self-monitoring and will be provided guidelines to follow at home. The OB/GYN physicians will monitor the blood glucose levels across testing, and will prescribe oral hypoglycemic medications or insulin to the patient if needed.</description>

    <description>In addition to standard care and telemonitoring, this group will use the mGDM app. This group will be provided with the same devices as the control group and in addition, the GDM app will be set up in their cellular device. The app will be on their smart phone and will support self-management by: i) providing health education, ii) helping patients identify and set target health goals (for diet, physical activity, and glucose levels), iii) enhancing their self-efficacy to meet target goals, and iv) facilitating desired support from family members. The core component of the mGDM app will be to allow GDM patients to record and self-monitor their carbohydrate intake, physical activity and blood glucose levels. Patients will be able to manually enter their weekly blood glucose levels and blood pressure readings on to the app</description>

    <description>We will use a user-centered design approach to develop a mobile app for GDM (mGDM) that matches the needs and technological sophistication of the target users. The goal of the app would be to assist patients in self management of GDM by improving their adherence to the recommended diet and physical activity regimens. The app will be used to collect information such as the carbohydrate consumption, the daily activity status and blood glucose and blood pressure measurements taken at home by the patients. The app will be set up in the phone of the participants and their data will be collected. The participants will be able to assess the usability and feasibility of the app. The app will also help clinicians by generating easily digestible visual displays of patient data and behaviors, which can aid in their clinical decision-making and counseling.</description>
