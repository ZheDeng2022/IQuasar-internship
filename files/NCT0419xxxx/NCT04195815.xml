  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will assess the feasibility of activity monitoring armbands for continuous&#xD;
      measurement of physical activity level in ME/CFS patients, during 6 months follow-up. The&#xD;
      main purpose is to assess if continuous measurement of activity level may be incorporated in&#xD;
      outcome measures in future clinical interventional trials.&#xD;

      The purpose is to assess feasibility of activity monitoring armbands for continuous&#xD;
      measurement of physical activity level in patents with Myalgic Encephalopathy/ Chronic&#xD;
      Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS), during 6 months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will assess which physical activity parameters that best seem to reflect&#xD;
      the participant's own perception of activity level, such as mean number of steps per 24&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will assess the agreement between continuous activity measurements by&#xD;
      activity armbands, and self-reported questionnaires for health-related quality of life (SF-36&#xD;
      ver.2) and for ME/CFS symptoms (DSQ-SF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will assess the agreement between activity monitoring by armbands, and&#xD;
      previously validated activity monitoring bracelets for 5-7 consecutive days, at baseline, at&#xD;
      3 months and at 6 months follow-up.&#xD;
