      A prospective, single arm, open-label, multicenter trial to assess the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      the Nerivio device in chronic migraine patients. This study will be conducted in three&#xD;
      phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I - Run-in:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be trained to use a smartphone migraine diary application. During&#xD;
      the 4 weeks of this phase, participants will be instructed to report all their migraines and&#xD;
      headaches at onset, 2 hours and 24 hours post report .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II - Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 4-week treatment phase in which participants will be asked to treat their migraine&#xD;
      headaches with the Nerivio device and report it using the smartphone application at baseline,&#xD;
      2 hours and 24 hours post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase III - Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An 8-week follow-up phase in which participants will incorporate the Nerivio device into&#xD;
      their usual care according to their preference (Nerivio only, medication only, both or none).&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to report all their migraines or headaches at onset, 2 hours post&#xD;
      report and 24 hours post report.&#xD;

      This open label study includes up to four visits. The enrollment and application training may&#xD;
      occur in two separate visits instead of one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First visit - The first visit will include screening, enrollment and training on the&#xD;
      application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment: The screening process will include an eligibility assessment and a urine&#xD;
      pregnancy test. Following successful screening, the site staff will provide the participants&#xD;
      with study related information, perform an enrollment interview and receive an informed&#xD;
      consent from the participants. During this visit, participants will complete baseline&#xD;
      questionnaires that included information on the frequency and severity of their migraine&#xD;
      attacks, typical associated symptoms, use of preventive and acute treatments, and the effect&#xD;
      that their migraine attacks have on their daily routine and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Application training: Eligible participants who enroll to the study will be trained to use&#xD;
      the diary mode of the application that is installed on their own smartphones. The&#xD;
      participants will be instructed to report the onset of all their migraines and headaches and&#xD;
      complete a migraine diary questions regarding their pain intensity levels, the&#xD;
      presence/absence of aura and associated migraine symptoms (nausea, photophobia, phonophobia,&#xD;
      and allodynia) as well as rate their stress level and functional disability at baseline, 2-&#xD;
      and 24-hours post-treatment. At the beginning of each treatment, participants will also be&#xD;
      asked to report the time elapsed from attack onset. The site personnel will be required to&#xD;
      document the training session in the Case Report Form (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Run-in phase: After the enrollment visit, participants will undergo a 4-week migraine diary&#xD;
      phase aimed to collect baseline migraine characteristics and further assess eligibility. The&#xD;
      participants will use the app to record pain intensity levels, the presence/absence of aura&#xD;
      and associated migraine symptoms (nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, and allodynia) as well as&#xD;
      the effect that their migraine attacks have on their daily routine and quality of life, at&#xD;
      baseline, 2- and 24-hours post-treatment. These reports will be transferred by the&#xD;
      application to the electronic data capture (EDC) system, where they will be collected and&#xD;
      registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who report at least 6 qualifying migraine headaches with pain data at baseline&#xD;
      and 2 hours post-treatment will continue to the treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second visit- Device training: Eligible participants who successfully complete the run-in&#xD;
      phase will receive the Nerivio™ device. The device will be registered and connected by&#xD;
      Bluetooth to their smartphone. During this visit, participants will be trained to use the&#xD;
      device. Device training will include finding the optimal individual stimulation intensity&#xD;
      level (perceptible but not painful), that will be subject to change during the treatment&#xD;
      phase. The site staff will also carefully review with the patient how to identify a&#xD;
      qualifying migraine headache (see below) and provide detailed instructions on study&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the research staff recognizes that the participant cannot tolerate the feeling of the&#xD;
      electrical stimulation, the participant may be withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the training, participants will also be informed on the key elements which are&#xD;
      critical for the successful conduct of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatments of migraine and headaches with Nerivio™ should be performed as soon as&#xD;
           possible after migraine headache or aura began and always within one hour of symptoms&#xD;
           onset. Treatments of mild headaches are accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Avoid taking rescue medications within two hours post-treatment (2 hours from start of&#xD;
           treatment), if possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The treatment should be performed for at least 30 minutes (the recommended treatment&#xD;
           duration is 45 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The site personnel will be required to document the training session in the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment phase: Participants will be instructed to use the device for the treatment of&#xD;
      migraine and/or headaches (see below) as soon as possible and always within 60 minutes of&#xD;
      onset during a period of up to 4 weeks. Participants will be instructed to use the device&#xD;
      with the intensity level identified during the device training visit (and adjust as&#xD;
      necessary) and make sure the stimulation is perceptible but not painful. Participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to avoid taking rescue medications within 2 hours post-treatment. If medications&#xD;
      are used, participants will be instructed to record in the app when and which medication was&#xD;
      taken at 2- and 24-hours post treatment. The participants will use the app to record pain&#xD;
      intensity levels, the presence/absence of aura and associated migraine symptoms (nausea,&#xD;
      photophobia, phonophobia, and allodynia) as well as the effect that their migraine attacks&#xD;
      have on their daily routine and quality of life, at baseline, 2- and 24-hours post-treatment.&#xD;
      At the beginning of each treatment, participants will also be asked to report the time&#xD;
      elapsed from attack onset. Adverse events will be reported throughout this phase of the study&#xD;
      directly to the site staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who do not achieve satisfactory relief at 2 hours post-treatment may treat again&#xD;
      with the Nerivio™ device or may treat with usual care at that time or any time thereafter if&#xD;
      the headache does not resolve. Participants will also be able to treat headache recurrence&#xD;
      with the device. Migraine headaches that are not treated with the device may be treated with&#xD;
      usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first reported treatment will be considered a &quot;training&quot; treatment, aimed to verify that&#xD;
      the participants use the device properly, and will only be included in the safety analysis.&#xD;
      The efficacy evaluation will be performed on the first treatment of a qualifying attack (see&#xD;
      below) following the training treatment (hereby termed &quot;test treatment&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third visit- Follow-up phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the 4-week period of the treatment phase, participants will return to the clinic to&#xD;
      fill questionnaires assessing satisfaction and user experience. All participants who complete&#xD;
      the treatment phase will enter an additional 8-week phase in which the device can be&#xD;
      incorporate into their usual care. Participants will treat their migraines and headaches&#xD;
      according to their preference- treatment with Nerivio only, treatment with medication only,&#xD;
      both treatment options, or none. Participants will be asked to report all their migraine&#xD;
      headaches at onset (migraines or headache), regardless if they are using the device or not.&#xD;
      The participants will use the app to record pain intensity levels, the presence/absence of&#xD;
      aura and associated migraine symptoms (nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, and allodynia) as&#xD;
      well as the effect that their migraine attacks have on their daily routine and quality of&#xD;
      life, at baseline, 2- and 24-hours post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fourth (final) visit - End of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will return to the clinic following the end of the follow-up phase, at which&#xD;
      time they will return the device. The participants will have the option of returning the&#xD;
      device by mail instead of an on-site visit. Participants may be asked to fill additional&#xD;
      questionnaires on their migraine and their experience with the device.&#xD;
