      The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of a miniaturized sleep apnea&#xD;
      test, called NightOwl. The system consists of a sensor placed on the fingertip and a&#xD;
      cloud-based analytics software. The sensor acquires accelerometer and photoplethysmographic&#xD;
      data. The software derives actigraphy from the former, and blood oxygen saturation and&#xD;
      peripheral arterial tone (PAT), among other features, from the latter. In order to assess&#xD;
      NightOwl's performance, the investigators will compare the respiratory event index (REI),&#xD;
      defined as the number of respiratory events per hour of sleep, derived by the NightOwl&#xD;
      system, to the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) obtained from manual analysis of the&#xD;
      polysomnography (PSG), which is the gold standard for sleep apnea diagnosis. The&#xD;
      investigators will also compare the total sleep time (TST) derived by both systems. This&#xD;
      study will be performed in a sleep lab environment.&#xD;

      system, to the AHI obtained from manual analysis of the polysomnography (PSG), which is the&#xD;
      gold standard for sleep apnea diagnosis. The investigators will also compare the total sleep&#xD;
      time (TST) derived by both systems. This study will be performed in a sleep lab environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As of March 2017, the new clinical practice guideline for diagnostic testing for adult sleep&#xD;
      apnea of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) for the first time formulates a strong&#xD;
      recommendation that both polysomnography (PSG) and home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) are&#xD;
      appropriate diagnostic testing options for uncomplicated adult patients who are at increased&#xD;
      risk of moderate to severe sleep apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collop et al. performed a comprehensive analysis of the evidence for HSAT devices to diagnose&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in out-of-center settings. The authors concluded that testing&#xD;
      devices that analyze changes in peripheral arterial tone (PAT) in combination with actigraphy&#xD;
      and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) are adequate to diagnose OSA in patient populations with a&#xD;
      high pre-test probability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators wish to assess the performance of a system for the diagnosis&#xD;
      of OSA that measures and analyzes the abovementioned parameters, called NightOwl. The system&#xD;
      consists of a small sensor device which is placed on the fingertip and a cloud-based&#xD;
      analytics platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is designed to be self-applied and initiated by the patient by attaching the sensor to the&#xD;
      fingertip by means of an adhesive patch.&#xD;

    <description>The evaluation of the level agreement (classification accuracy) between patient categorization (into sleep apnea severity categories) obtained by the NightOwl and those obtained by the PSG. This measure is calculated by dividing the number of participants on which both NightOwl and the PSG agree on the sleep apnea severity category by the total number of participants.</description>
