      This study is an open-label, Phase Ib clinical study to evaluate recombinant human GM-CSF&#xD;
      herpes simplex virus intratumoral injection (OrienX010) in combination with recombinant&#xD;
      humanized anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody infusion (Toripalimab) as neoadjuvant treatment in&#xD;
      patients with complete resectable stage III and IV (M1a) melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is planned to enroll approximately 30 patients with stage III and IV melanoma&#xD;
      (M1a) who meet protocol requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of recombinant human GM-CSF herpes simplex&#xD;
      virus intratumoral injection (OrienX010) in combination with recombinant humanized anti-PD-1&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody infusion (Toripalimab infusion) as neoadjuvant treatment in the patients&#xD;

    <description>This study consisted of 3 stage of neoadjuvant treatment, surgical, and adjuvant treatment. Neoadjuvant treatment period: OrienX010 intratumoral injection in combination with Toripalimab infusion. Toripalimab : 3 mg/kg, IV infusion: Once every 2 weeks for 6 doses ; OrienX010: Maximum injection volume 8 × 108 pfu, intratumoral injection: Once every 2 weeks for 6 doses ; Surgical treatment period: 2 weeks after the last dose of neoadjuvant treatment (± 7 days), the investigator designed the surgical protocol of the melanoma radical surgery according to the patient's individual disease, and performed postoperative care according to the patient's condition.&#xD;
Adjuvant treatment period: 3 weeks after operation (± 7 days), the patient was given Toripalimab infusion. Toripalimab 3 mg/kg intravenously given every 3 weeks (every 3 weeks per cycle) for up to 1 year (the one-year duration will be counted from 1st dose in neoadjuvant treatment).</description>
