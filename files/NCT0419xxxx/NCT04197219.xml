  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to see if adding the experimental medication, axitinib, to&#xD;
      usual treatment with pembrolizumab will work better than pembrolizumab alone. The study team&#xD;
      will look at overall safety and side effects of the combination of axitinib and pembrolizumab&#xD;
      to see how well it is tolerated. Researchers will also want to take some research blood&#xD;
      samples to explore what effects the combination of treatment has on participants' cells and&#xD;
      immune system and to see if there are things in participants' blood that can predict a&#xD;
      response or resistance to the combined treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open label study of pembrolizumab in combination with axitinib in adult&#xD;
      women with recurrent endometrial cancer with deficient mismatch repair system. Twenty-six&#xD;
      participants in total will be enrolled into the study. All participants enrolled will receive&#xD;
      pembrolizumab as standard of care combined with axitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Axitinib is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment in certain&#xD;
      participants with advanced renal cell cancer but is considered investigational (experimental)&#xD;
      in this study. However, it is not FDA approved for recurrent endometrial cancer. Axitinib is&#xD;
      a type of drug called a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It is thought to work by blocking tumor&#xD;
      vasculature and decreasing the blood supply to the tumor. Also it has been shown to improve&#xD;
      the function of immune cells within the tumor which may enable them to kill the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab is an immunotherapy that is FDA approved to treat participants with recurrent&#xD;
      endometrial cancer with deficient mismatch repair system (dMMR). dMMR means having genetic&#xD;
      changes within the tumor that make it unstable and potentially able to benefit from&#xD;
      immunotherapy. Pembrolizumab works by improving the function of the immune cells enabling&#xD;
      them to kill cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Axitinib given in combination with pembrolizumab has not been tested for endometrial cancer.&#xD;
      In this study the combination of axitinib and pembrolizumab is experimental because it is not&#xD;
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&#xD;
