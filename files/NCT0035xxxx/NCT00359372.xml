      This study will explore which characteristics of patients with heart failure will likely&#xD;
      predict improvement after cardiac resynchronization (CRT), implantation of a pacemaker to&#xD;
      improve heart function. In spite of major medical advances, about 30% to 40% of patients with&#xD;
      heart failure do not respond to CRT, and the reasons are not well understood. This study will&#xD;
      involve magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electrocardiogram (ECG), and echocardiography&#xD;
      techniques to let researchers examine what may influence response to CRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients ages 18 and older with a left ventricular disorder and who are not pregnant or&#xD;
      breastfeeding may be eligible for this study. Initial evaluation will take 5 to 6 hours. A&#xD;
      blood sample of about 2 tablespoons will be collected, and several procedures will be&#xD;
      performed. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of body organs&#xD;
      and tissues. For that procedure, patients will lie on a table that slides into the enclosed&#xD;
      tunnel of the scanner and be asked to lie still. They will be in the scanner for 30 to 90&#xD;
      minutes. As the scanner takes pictures, patients will hear knocking sounds, and they may be&#xD;
      asked to hold their breath intermittently for 5 to 20 seconds. During part of the scan, a&#xD;
      drug called gadolinium will be given intravenously (IV), to make the heart easier to see.&#xD;
      Patients will be able to communicate with the MRI staff at all times during the scan. At any&#xD;
      time, patients may ask to be moved out of the machine. Patients having metal in their body&#xD;
      that interferes with the MRI scanner should not have this test. During the procedure, an ECG&#xD;
      machine will monitor the heart, through wires connected to pads on the skin. Patients will&#xD;
      have an echocardiogram, in which sound waves look at the heart. A small handheld probe will&#xD;
      touch the chest and abdomen, and an IV tube may be inserted to inject a contrast drug to&#xD;
      improve the quality of heart images. Patients will have a cardiopulmonary stress test&#xD;
      (treadmill test) and a 6-minute walk test, both before pacemaker implantation and then 6&#xD;
      months afterward. Also before and after pacemaker implantation, patients will complete the&#xD;
      Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, regarding the impact of heart failure on&#xD;
      patients' lives. The follow-up visit will take 3 to 4 hours.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Many patients with heart failure benefit from cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) which&#xD;
      involves implantation of a pacemaker to improve the coordination of heart function. However,&#xD;
      approximately 30-40% of patients fail to respond to this therapy with current selection&#xD;
      criteria. We hypothesize that patients with echocardiographic and MRI measures of a high&#xD;
      degree of LV mechanical dyssynchrony are more likely to benefit from CRT than patients with&#xD;
      less baseline dyssynchrony. Severe LV remodeling as measured by MRI may also predict patients&#xD;
      less likely to benefit from therapy. In addition, myocardial fibrosis/scarring as measured by&#xD;
      MRI delayed enhancement imaging may predict segments or subjects less likely to respond to&#xD;
      CRT even in patients without ischemic heart disease. In this study, patients with New York&#xD;
      Heart Association class III - IV heart failure will undergo imaging and stress testing prior&#xD;
      to CRT pacemaker implantation and 6 months later to determine predictors of response.&#xD;
      Considering the complexity of the protocol and novelty of some aspects of the MRI&#xD;
      examination, we consider this an exploratory observational protocol.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION and EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        No one will be excluded from this study based on race, gender, and ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. LV dysfunction with an LV ejection fraction less than or equal to 35% (by clinical&#xD;
             echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, radionuclide ventriculography, or MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV functional status&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. QRS interval greater than or equal to 120msec (measured on clinical ECG)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Optimal pharmacological therapy for heart failure with at least 1 month on an&#xD;
             ACE-inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) and if on a beta blocker, 3&#xD;
             months on a stable dose of a beta blocker. Patients need to be taking their medicines&#xD;
             consistently to be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Coronary artery bypass graft surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention within 60&#xD;
             days of enrollment.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. History of medical non-compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Women who are pregnant or not using medically acceptable birth control (since the&#xD;
             x-rays used to guide pacemaker therapy may increase the risk to the fetus and the&#xD;
             fetal risks of gadolinium are not well known).&#xD;
