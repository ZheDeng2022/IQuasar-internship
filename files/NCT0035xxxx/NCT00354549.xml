      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different&#xD;
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and&#xD;
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Erlotinib may stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, carboplatin, and gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.&#xD;
      Giving bevacizumab together with erlotinib followed by cisplatin or carboplatin and&#xD;
      gemcitabine at disease progression may be an effective treatment for non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving bevacizumab together with erlotinib&#xD;
      followed by cisplatin or carboplatin and gemcitabine works in treating patients with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed or recurrent stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the efficacy of bevacizumab and erlotinib hydrochloride as initial therapy in&#xD;
           patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent stage IIIB or IV non-squamous non-small cell&#xD;
           lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the safety of bevacizumab and erlotinib hydrochloride as initial therapy in these&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the quality of life (QOL) in patients treated with bevacizumab and erlotinib&#xD;
           hydrochloride.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the efficacy and safety of subsequent cisplatin or carboplatin in combination&#xD;
           with gemcitabine hydrochloride in patients who have disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the QOL in patients treated with subsequent cisplatin or carboplatin in&#xD;
           combination with gemcitabine hydrochloride at disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify novel biomarkers in predicting response to therapy and toxicity in patients&#xD;
           treated with bevacizumab and erlotinib hydrochloride as initial therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, prospective, open-label study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1 and oral erlotinib hydrochloride&#xD;
      once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning within 3 weeks of documented disease progression, patients receive gemcitabine&#xD;
      hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. They also receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour&#xD;
      or carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment with gemcitabine hydrochloride with&#xD;
      either cisplatin or carboplatin repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and periodically during study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 101 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
