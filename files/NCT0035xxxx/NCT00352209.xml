  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the incidence of cardiac complications, particularly cardiomyopathy,&#xD;
      in patients who have undergone allogeneic (donor) stem cell transplantation at NIH. Cardiac&#xD;
      complications in these patients are well documented. Most commonly, patients develop&#xD;
      congestive heart failure or pericarditis after receiving high-dose cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
      radiation, or other intensive chemotherapy regimens prior to the transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most data in the medical literature suggest that the rate of serious cardiac complications is&#xD;
      relatively low, at about 5 percent or less. Recently, a cluster of cases of significant&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy in stem cell transplant patients at the NIH Clinical Center has prompted&#xD;
      concern that the incidence of these complications is higher than that reported in the medical&#xD;
      literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will further define the incidence of cardiac problems, primarily focusing on&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy, with the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To define the incidence of cardiomyopathy in allogeneic stem cell transplant patients&#xD;
           enrolled in National Cancer Institute (NCI) and National Heart, Lung, and Blood (NHLBI)&#xD;
           protocols at the NIH Clinical Center&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document the presence or absence of various known or suspected risk factors for&#xD;
           cardiomyopathy in the documented cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of a chart review of patients who have had an allogeneic stem cell&#xD;
      transplant on either an NHLBI or NCI protocol since 1999.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is a first step in clarifying the cardiac complications following stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation, their incidence, and characteristics of the patient populations. It will&#xD;
      look at patient demographics, the characteristics of the cardiac complication, and known or&#xD;
      suspected risk factors.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cardiac complications in patients who have undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation (HSCT) have been well documented. Most commonly patients present with&#xD;
      congestive heart failure and/or pericarditis after receiving high-dose cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
      total body irradiation (TBI) or other intensive conditioning / preparative regimens prior to&#xD;
      the allogeneic transplant. The majority of the data in the medical literature suggests that&#xD;
      the rate of serious cardiac events appears to be relatively low at approximately 5% or less.&#xD;
      Recently, there appears to have been a cluster of patient cases (approximately 15) of&#xD;
      significant cardiomyopathy in patients who have received an allogeneic HSCT at the NIH&#xD;
      Clinical Center over the past year. These cases have been consulted on by the Cardiology&#xD;
      consult service and have included both NCI and NHLBI protocol patients. This cluster of cases&#xD;
      has prompted concern that the incidence of cardiac toxicity recently seen at the NIH Clinical&#xD;
      Center is not consistent with the reported incidence of significant cardiac toxicity in the&#xD;
      medical literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed retrospective chart review is intended to further define the incidence of&#xD;
      cardiac toxicity, primarily focusing on cardiomyopathy. The project is an initial step to&#xD;
      consolidate the data from both the NCI and NHLBI transplant programs and clarify the&#xD;
      documented cardiac toxicities, the incidence, and the demographics of the patient&#xD;
      populations. We also plan to document the presence or absence of a variety of known and&#xD;
      suspected risk factors for cardiotoxicity. This analysis will only be preliminary but will&#xD;
      potentially lead to more formal prospective studies on cardiotoxicity related to allogeneic&#xD;
      HSCT.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Patients who have undergone an allogeneic HSCT on either an NHLBI or NCI protocol since&#xD;
        1999 will be the patient population for this chart review. Patients with documented serious&#xD;
        cardiac events will be identified from NHLBI cardiology consult records, NCI and NHLBI&#xD;
        research data bases, and the data base of the echocardiogram service.&#xD;
