  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn if kinase, a protein found in the heart, contributes to&#xD;
      thickening of the heart muscle in people with high blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A protein called myosin causes the heart to contract and relax. It is thought that kinase&#xD;
      changes myosin to make it work better at different heart rates. This study will try to&#xD;
      determine if, in some people with high blood pressure, the different forms of this protein&#xD;
      cause changes in the heart. If the protein affects the size of the heart, it might be&#xD;
      possible to use it to improve heart function after an injury, such as a heart attack.&#xD;
&#xD;
      African-Americans with high blood pressure will be eligible for this study. Current data show&#xD;
      that of almost 900 multi-ethnic individuals, the particular form of kinase under study in&#xD;
      this project is found exclusively in the African-American population. Study participants will&#xD;
      have two tubes of blood drawn for DNA testing to determine what form of kinase is present. An&#xD;
      electrocardiogram will also be done if a recent one is not available. Some people may also&#xD;
      have an echocardiogram, an ultrasound test to image the heart.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Genetic and in vitro mechanical studies in our laboratory have suggested that the&#xD;
      perturbations in the phosphorylation of the cardiac myosin regulatory light chain (RLC) can&#xD;
      modulate cardiac function and produce a compensatory hypertrophic response. We have cloned a&#xD;
      novel human cardiac kinase (MLCK) that targets the cardiac RLC and identified a common allele&#xD;
      unique to the African-American population. The purpose of this protocol is to evaluate a&#xD;
      large group of African-American individuals with hypertension and/or cardiac disease, a&#xD;
      portion of who will possess this allele. It is well documented that hypertensive&#xD;
      African-Americans have an increased prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). We&#xD;
      expect that, in this population of hypertensive individuals, we will find an increased left&#xD;
      ventricular mass in individuals who are heterozygous or homozygous for this kinase allele.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients with the allele can be matched to others in the cohort without the&#xD;
      allele and evaluated by echocardiography and cardiac MRI to evaluate cardiac function and&#xD;
      chamber size. In addition, metabolic stress testing will be performed to assess the&#xD;
      implications of this allele on clinical performance. Another group of 75 Afro-Americans with&#xD;
      dilated cardiomyopathy will be referred from local heart failure clinics and evaluated in a&#xD;
      similar fashion. Allele prevalence and associated cardiac findings will also be compared with&#xD;
      hypertensive patients matched for age and gender. In a parallel experiment, mice&#xD;
      over-expressing this kinase, are being generated and will provide us with tissue samples with&#xD;
      which to pursue the biophysical basis of the mechanical changes in muscle function.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria (Main Cohort):&#xD;
&#xD;
        Afro-American patients with a history of hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age greater than or equal to 21 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        Presence of the kinase allele (homo or heterozygous)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ability to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria (Myopathy Cohort):&#xD;
&#xD;
        All of the above as well as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 35% by any imaging technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        For subjects with Kinase Allele:&#xD;
&#xD;
        There will be no exclusion criteria. Patients will be evaluated even if they are only able&#xD;
        to participate in part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For Subjects without the kinase allele and Myopathy Cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of myocardial infarction&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of significant valve disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of primary hyperthropic or infiltrative cardiomyopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of rheumatic heart disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        Chronic atrial arrhythmia, bundle branch block intraventricular conduction defect or&#xD;
        definite myocardial infarction on EKG&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inability to perform a metabolic stress test&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inability to perform a cMRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        Poor echocardiographic windows precluding accurate analysis&#xD;
