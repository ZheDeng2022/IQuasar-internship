      This study will examine ways to establish and standardize normal measurements for children,&#xD;
      specific to gender, age, and body surface, when using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI,&#xD;
      which was introduced in the 1980s, is being used more frequently for children. In this study,&#xD;
      researchers seek to understand how a child's heart is different from that of an adult, when&#xD;
      an MRI is used for tests. More children with congenital heart disease are living longer.&#xD;
      Researchers are looking for a better way to assess their cardiac anatomy and function, and to&#xD;
      compare findings with normal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients ages 8 to 21 in good health and who do not smoke may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      There will be a blood or urine test to check for pregnancy in female volunteers who have&#xD;
      begun menstruating or who are over age 12. Pregnancy test results must be negative for those&#xD;
      patients to stay in the study. The MRI technique uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves&#xD;
      to obtain images of body organs and tissues. For that procedure, patients will lie still on a&#xD;
      table that slides into the enclosed tunnel of the scanner. They will be in the scanner from&#xD;
      20 to 60 minutes. As the scanner takes pictures, patients will hear knocking or beeping&#xD;
      sounds, and they will wear earplugs to reduce the noise. Patients will be able to communicate&#xD;
      with the MRI staff at all times during the scan. At any time, patients or their parents may&#xD;
      ask that the patients be moved out of the machine. If they would like, patients can bring a&#xD;
      music CD or listen to a radio station through headphones. Some MRI techniques require&#xD;
      monitoring while the patient is undergoing the scan. For monitoring of the heart, an&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (EKG) will be performed to make sure that the heart rhythm is normal and&#xD;
      that heart disease is not present. Patients may be asked to wear adhesive patches that are&#xD;
      attached to wires of the EKG machine on their chests. To monitor breathing, patients may be&#xD;
      asked to wear a rubber belt that stretches as they take a breath. So that the best quality&#xD;
      images are produced, patients may be asked to hold their breath for about 15 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the MRI scan, patients may experience peripheral nerve stimulation, usually&#xD;
      experienced as a muscle twitch. It is caused by rapid switching of magnetic fields and is not&#xD;
      serious. Patients who feel a muscle twitch should report that sensation to the person&#xD;
      performing the scan. It is possible, though unlikely, for a painful sensation to result from&#xD;
      nerve stimulation. Patients should immediately report if they have pain so that the scan can&#xD;
      be stopped.&#xD;

      A cardiac MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scan will be performed on normal children and&#xD;
      young adult volunteers. These studies will be conducted in the MRI systems located in the NIH&#xD;
      Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. The results will be used to establish the normal&#xD;
      standard MRI measurements for the pediatric population; including left ventricular mass,&#xD;
      ejection fractions and other standard cardiac measurements.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any normal volunteer between the ages of 8 and 21 years old, non-smoker who is capable of&#xD;
        giving assent and has a legal guardian to give informed consent if under 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A subject will be excluded if he/she has a contraindication to MR scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Brain aneurysm clip&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Implanted neural stimulator&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Implanted cardiac pacemaker or defibrillator&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Cochlear implant&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Ocular foreign body (e.g. metal shavings)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Insulin pump&#xD;
&#xD;
        &lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
        To assess whether subjects are indeed normal, the legal guardian will be asked to fill out&#xD;
        a questionnaire. Subjects also will be excluded for a paralyzed hemidiaphragm, morbid&#xD;
        obesity (BMI greater than 30%), claustrophobia, smokers, significant asthma (greater than&#xD;
        one asthma attack per month for the past three months), pregnancy, major medical illness&#xD;
        requiring regular medications (such as steroids that may alter muscle mass, sickle cell&#xD;
        disease, thalassemia), history of cardiac disease (requiring SBE prophylaxis when visiting&#xD;
        the dentist), and/or history of significant previous surgery that may alter cardiac anatomy&#xD;
        (such as diaphragmatic hernia, tracheoesophageal fistula).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Females of menstruating age will receive a pregnancy test as part of the screening process&#xD;
        to participate in this protocol. If they do not wish to be tested, they cannot participate&#xD;
        in this voluntary protocol.&#xD;
