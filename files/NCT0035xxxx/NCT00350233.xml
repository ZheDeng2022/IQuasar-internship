      The objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of MRgFUS in the&#xD;
      treatment of metastatic bone tumors.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bone is the third most common organ involved by metastasic disease behind lung and liver. In&#xD;
      breast cancer, bone is the second most common site of metastatic spread, and 90% of patients&#xD;
      dying of breast cancer have bone metastasis. Breast and prostate cancer metastasize to bone&#xD;
      most frequently, which reflects the high incidence of both these tumors, as well as their&#xD;
      prolonged clinical courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post cancer survival has increased with improvement in early detection and treatments. As a&#xD;
      consequence, the number of patients developing metastatic bone disease during their lifetime&#xD;
      has also increased. Patients with bone metastasis from breast cancer have an average 2-year&#xD;
      survival from the time of presentation with their first bone lesion. In patients who die from&#xD;
      breast, prostate, and lung cancer, autopsy studies have shown that up to 85% have evidence of&#xD;
      bone metastases at the time of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatments for patients with bone metastases are primarily palliative and include&#xD;
      localized therapies (radiation and surgery), systemic therapies (chemotherapy, hormonal&#xD;
      therapy, radiopharmaceutical, and bisphosphanates), and analgesics (opioids and non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs). Recently, radiofrequency ablation has been tested as a treatment&#xD;
      option for bone metastases. The main goals of these treatments are improvement of quality of&#xD;
      life and functional level. These goals can be further described: 1) Pain relief, 2)&#xD;
      Preservation and restoration of function, 3) Local tumor control, 4) Skeletal stabilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that MRgFUS is a safe and potentially effective non-invasive&#xD;
      treatment for metastatic bone tumors with a low incidence of co-morbidity. Based on the&#xD;
      result of this study the Sponsor will initiate a larger study in an effort to approve&#xD;
      metastatic bone tumors as an indication for its MRgFUS ExAblate device.&#xD;
