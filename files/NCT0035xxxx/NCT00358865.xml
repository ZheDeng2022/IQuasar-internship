      The purpose of this study is to check the usability of Virtual Reality (VR) Video Capture&#xD;
      Projected System in children with acquired brain injury(ABI)and comparing their performance&#xD;
      to the performance of normally developing children. The trial shall include 15 subjects in&#xD;
      each group, aged 6-12 years old. ABI subjects are hospitalized at the hospital's Pediatric&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Department Each subject will experience 3 different virtual environments. The&#xD;
      subjects in the trial group will practice 3 experiences (3 times in 3 different days) during&#xD;
      a period of a week to 10 days, to check the practice effect.In addition, all subjects will be&#xD;
      tested in three tests: &quot;PEDI&quot; - to evaluate the functional abilities of daily living&#xD;
      (dressing, eating...),The &quot;Melbourne Assessment&quot; - to evaluate functional movements of upper&#xD;
      extremities, and the TEA-ch - to evaluate different attention abilities. Performance&#xD;
      correlations will be tested between these tests and the performance in the VR first&#xD;
      experience.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to check the usability of Virtual Reality (VR) Video Capture&#xD;
      Projected System in children with acquired brain injury(ABI) comparing their performance with&#xD;
      the performance of normally developing children, matched by age, gender,sector and parents'&#xD;
      education. subjects' age: 6 - 12 years old. The trial shall include 15 subjects in each&#xD;
      group. ABI subjects are hospitalized at Sheba Hospital's Pediatric Rehabilitation Department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will experience 3 different virtual environments. The subjects in the trial&#xD;
      group will practice 3 experiences (3 times in 3 different days) during a period of a week to&#xD;
      10 days, to check the practice effect. In addition, all subjects will be tested in three&#xD;

      eating...),The &quot;Melbourne Assessment&quot; - to evaluate functional movements of upper&#xD;
      extremities, and the TEA-ch - to evaluate difference attention abilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlations between those tests to the performance in the VR experiences will be checked&#xD;
      with Pearson's statistical correlation tests. The differences between the trial group (ABI&#xD;
      children) and the control group will be checked with Independent t-tests.&#xD;

        The study sample consisted of 33 children, and was divided into study and control groups:&#xD;
        16 children with ABI from the Pediatric Rehabilitation department at the Sheba Medical&#xD;
        Center, Tel Hashomer in the study group (mean age = 7.91, S.D. = 1.43, range from 6 to 11.4&#xD;
        years old), and 17 healthy participants in the control group (mean age = 7.94, S.D. = 1.57,&#xD;
        range from 6 - 11.33 years).&#xD;
