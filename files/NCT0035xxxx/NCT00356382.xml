      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a cultured dairy drink with&#xD;
      high concentrations of active L casei to reduce the cumulative rate of illness in&#xD;
      daycare/school children ages 3 to 6.&#xD;

      Probiotics are live microorganisms, which when administered in sufficient amounts, may&#xD;
      improve health. Often, probiotics are ingested as supplements in powder, pill, or liquid&#xD;
      form, designed specifically for medicinal benefit. Such supplements used in children have&#xD;
      shown some potential benefits in the treatment and prevention of various diseases, including&#xD;
      diarrhea, asthma, necrotizing enterocolitis and allergies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past few years, interest has increased in the health-enhancing role f specific foods,&#xD;
      referred to as functional foods- foods providing health benefits beyond their nutritional&#xD;
      value. Yogurt, a fermented milk product produced by the action of two bacteria, Lactobacillus&#xD;
      (L.) bulgaricus and Streptococcus (S.) thermophilus, is a functional food. In fact,&#xD;
      two-thirds of primary care physicians, who counsel patients about nutrition, recommend&#xD;
      consuming yogurt containing live active cultures for their patients' health benefit. However,&#xD;
      evidence for these health outcomes is not sufficiently strong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daycare and school centers are ideal places for the transmission of respiratory infections&#xD;
      and childhood diarrhea, often resulting in many missed days of both daycare and parental&#xD;
      work. Illnesses related to daycare centers have been estimated to cost $1.8 billion per year&#xD;
      in the United States. One of the primary purposes of daycare is to allow parents to work&#xD;
      while their child is taken care of, thus, absences due to illnesses have many direct and&#xD;
      indirect associated costs. Unfortunately, children in daycare centers have been shown to have&#xD;
      more outpatient doctor visits, emergency room visits, and increased usage of prescription&#xD;
      medicines than children in daycare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our overall goal is to study a cultured dairy drik with an efficacious probiotic at doses&#xD;
      that result in probiotic survival in the gastrointestinal tract and subsequently reduce&#xD;
      illnesses in daycare/school children ages 3-6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for focusing on a drink as a vehicle for transmission of probiotics, is that it&#xD;
      has the potential for a much greater public health impact than using probiotics in a&#xD;
      medicinal manner, such as pills or capsules. Yogurt and yogurt like probiotic drinks are well&#xD;
      established and popular with children and parents, a product that traditionally provides live&#xD;
      cultures to the diet, and can provide protein, vitamins and minerals that are nutritious for&#xD;
      the child. Additionally, these drinks are relatively inexpensive, widely available, and easy&#xD;
      to ingest even for individuals with lactose intolerance. These positive attributes make it an&#xD;
      idea carrier to deliver the health benefits of probiotics.&#xD;
