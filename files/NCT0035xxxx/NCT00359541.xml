  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at how voriconazole, a drug used to treat or protect against fungal&#xD;
      infections, affects the body. Adverse effects associated with voriconazole include skin&#xD;
      problems and temporary changes in vision, mental status and liver function. There is some&#xD;
      evidence that these side effects may be more intense when there are high levels of the drug&#xD;
      in the blood. The amount of voriconazole in the body is determined by how much of the drug&#xD;
      the patient receives and by the patient's ability to inactivate and excrete it, which may be&#xD;
      determined in part by genes. This study will examine: 1) side effects patients develop from&#xD;
      voriconazole; 2) whether the side effects experienced are related to the concentration of&#xD;
      drug in the body; and 3) the role of genes in determining how quickly the body inactivates&#xD;
      and excretes the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 12 and older who are participating in studies in the National Institute of Allergy&#xD;
      and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) or the National Heart,&#xD;
      Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and have been treated with voriconazole for 15 days or less&#xD;
      may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation involves the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identification and recording of adverse effects patients experience due to voriconazole&#xD;
           treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of basic information about the patient's medical history and treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draws once a week during the patient's hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of routine laboratory test results ordered by the patient's doctor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw to identify genes responsible for voriconazole inactivation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weekly monitoring for the possibility of voriconazole adverse effects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw to measure blood levels of voriconazole when the drug is stopped, if it is&#xD;
           stopped because of an adverse effect&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluations at outpatient visits, including a blood draw to measure voriconazole blood&#xD;
           levels&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the study ends 7 days after voriconazole treatment is stopped because it is&#xD;
      no longer needed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Voriconazole (Vfend(Registered Trademark), Pfizer) has achieved common usage at the NIH&#xD;
      (National Institutes of Health) Clinical Research Center for the treatment of fungal&#xD;
      infections in immunosuppressed patients. Toxicity includes relatively frequent but reversible&#xD;
      changes in vision and more infrequent, potentially serious hepatotoxicity, decreased&#xD;
      cognitive function and rash. Incidence of these more serious adverse events has been&#xD;
      difficult to ascertain because of the morbidity of underlying disease in patients receiving&#xD;
      voriconazole, but a minimum estimate is 10 percent. It is known that voriconazole plasma&#xD;
      concentrations vary between patients over a fifty-fold range but it is not known whether&#xD;
      toxicity is related to plasma drug exposure. The reason for the differing voriconazole plasma&#xD;
      concentrations between normal individuals is partly due to genetic variations in hepatic&#xD;
      cytochrome enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 (Cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 9&#xD;
      and 19, respectively). In patients with underlying illness, drug interactions and decreased&#xD;
      hepatic drug clearance may contribute to variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to record prospectively the adverse effects of voriconazole in&#xD;
      Clinical Center patients who have been prescribed the drug by their primary physician. We&#xD;
      will ask the primary physician to order a trough voriconazole plasma levels once a week. The&#xD;
      test will not be reported to the physician. Because interpretation of the test is unknown,&#xD;
      the physicians will be blinded to the report. Rather, the primary objective of the study is&#xD;
      to analyze the voriconazole plasma concentrations when the study is completed to determine if&#xD;
      there is a concentration and duration of drug exposure that correlates with toxicity. A&#xD;
      secondary objective is to determine the 2C9 and 2C19 genotype of patients and search for&#xD;
      possible correlations between genotype and plasma voriconazole concentrations. Administration&#xD;
      of other drugs given to the patient will be tracked to analyze whether any previously unknown&#xD;
      drug interactions seem to have changed the voriconazole plasma concentration. The study will&#xD;
      also determine the incidence of adverse effects of voriconazole in our patient population.&#xD;
