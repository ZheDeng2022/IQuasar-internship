      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of unilateral deep brain stimulation on&#xD;
      upper and lower extremity motor function in advanced Parkinson's disease patients. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized the unilateral stimulation will lead to improvements in bilateral motor&#xD;
      functioning.&#xD;

      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic progressive degenerative illness in which dopaminergic&#xD;
      neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta deteriorate resulting in a reduction in&#xD;
      striatal dopamine. Decreased levels of dopamine in PD patients results in varying&#xD;
      combinations of akinesia, bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity and gait\postural instability.&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting nearly&#xD;
      1.2 million Americans with annual treatment costs approaching $25 billion. Deep brain&#xD;
      stimulation (DBS) is a surgical approach developed for the treatment of advanced PD that&#xD;
      provides promise in alleviating its motor deficits. The most common stimulation site for the&#xD;
      treatment of advanced PD is the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Nearly 90 percent of patients&#xD;
      involved in a multi-center trial with STN stimulation underwent single session bilateral&#xD;
      implantation. It is generally accepted that bilateral STN stimulation improves upper and&#xD;
      lower extremity function. However, bilateral STN stimulation may be associated with&#xD;
      postoperative morbidity including cognitive deficits and neuropsychiatric changes. In&#xD;
      contrast, the effects of unilateral STN stimulation on bilateral upper and lower extremity&#xD;
      motor function are poorly understood. The question of whether to proceed with bilateral or&#xD;
      unilateral surgery is important, as a significant number of patients for whom surgery is a&#xD;
      consideration have relative contraindications such as age greater than 70, cognitive decline,&#xD;
      or other medical conditions that may prevent bilateral implantation. Considering the risks&#xD;
      for bilateral implantation may be greater than unilateral procedures, it is necessary to&#xD;
      determine if unilateral stimulation is an effective means of ameliorating PD symptoms. The&#xD;
      primary aim of this collaborative project is to determine the effects of unilateral STN DBS&#xD;
      on functional upper (manual dexterity) and lower (postural stability and gait initiation)&#xD;
      extremity motor performance in Veterans with advanced PD. The results from these studies have&#xD;
      the potential to impact the use of DBS in the treatment of advanced PD. Positive bilateral&#xD;
      results with unilateral stimulation of STN may allow patients not currently considered&#xD;
      eligible for bilateral implantation to be considered for unilateral procedures as a method of&#xD;
      treating PD symptoms. Our general hypothesis is that unilateral STN DBS acts to override&#xD;
      disrupted neural activity of the basal ganglia in one hemisphere. The resultant normalized&#xD;
      basal ganglia output to the SMA then allows for improved planning and control of bilateral&#xD;
      actions. Bilateral upper and lower extremity motor performance will be quantified in a group&#xD;
      of advanced PD patients with unilateral STN DBS patients while &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; stimulation. It&#xD;
      is hypothesized that unilateral STN DBS will result in bilateral improvements in upper and&#xD;
      lower extremity motor function.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  a) Patients must have had the Deep Brain Stimulator implanted for at least six months&#xD;
             prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hoehn and Yahr stage III or worse when off stimulation and medication&#xD;

             plus (i.e. progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy, striato-nigral&#xD;
             degeneration, etc) all patients included in this study must have demonstrated a good&#xD;
             response to levodopa, defined as demonstrating at least 30% improvement in&#xD;
             parkinsonian motor signs, based on UPDRS motor examination subscore following the&#xD;
             administration of levodopa during their screening neurological exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unsatisfactory clinical response to maximal medical management A stable and optimal&#xD;

          -  Clinically significant medical disease that would increase risk of developing pre- or&#xD;
             postoperative complications (e.g. significant cardiac or pulmonary disease,&#xD;
             uncontrolled hypertension).&#xD;
