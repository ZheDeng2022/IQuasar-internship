    <textblock>
      Whether patient-maintained sedation (the patient controls his/her degree of sedation using a&#xD;
      hand-held device) using the drug propofol is safer and more effective when using&#xD;
      deteriorating reaction time as an added safeguard against the potential for over sedation in&#xD;
      a groups of patients undergoing oral surgery, general dentistry and colonoscopy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients receiving conscious sedation for dentistry and endoscopy are usually treated with&#xD;
      intermittent bolus doses of intravenous midazolam (administered by the operator-sedationist).&#xD;
      The safety of such a regime has been questioned with reports of up to 13 % of patients&#xD;
      desaturating to below 80 % in the recovery area following sedation for endoscopy. Mortality&#xD;
      occurs in 0.05 % of endoscopy patients (with approximately 60 % of this being due to&#xD;
      hypoxaemia). The aim of our work, therefore, is to look at providing sedation that is both&#xD;
      safer as well as being efficacious.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug propofol, the agent most commonly used to induce general anaesthesia in the UK, is&#xD;
      also frequently administered intravenously by anaesthetists in low doses to provide conscious&#xD;
      sedation for patients undergoing unpleasant procedures i.e. patients become relaxed,&#xD;
      anxiety-free, but maintain verbal contact throughout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technique of patient maintained sedation using the drug propofol (the patient can&#xD;
      increase the amount of sedation (and propofol) they receive by pressing a demand button&#xD;
      attached to a standard infusion device) has been used by anaesthetists and evaluated since&#xD;
      1997.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several recent studies published and submitted for publication by this research group on&#xD;
      patient maintained sedation using the drug propofol have shown this method of sedation to be&#xD;
      safe and effective in dental patients (over 120 patients studied). It was also shown that&#xD;
      this method, when compared to the established method of sedation in oral surgery (the dentist&#xD;
      administering doses of midazolam intravenously), to produce both quicker recovery and less&#xD;
      anxiety prior to the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The routine use of propofol traditionally is restricted to anaesthetists, as in high doses&#xD;
      general anaesthesia is produced with possible loss of airway patency. Currently the safety&#xD;
      feature is predominantly that as patients become more sedated they cannot press the patient&#xD;
      demand button and hence cannot increase the amount of propofol they are receiving. Also the&#xD;
      device ensures that the blood and brain concentrations have equilibrated to within 10% of&#xD;
      each other before another successful demand for propofol can be made (usually takes&#xD;
      approximately two minutes) and it only allows a maximum calculated brain concentration of 3&#xD;
      micrograms/milliliter of propofol. The device also will start to decrease the calculated&#xD;
      brain concentration of propofol if the demand button has not been pressed for six minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the encouraging results above we also found in a recent pilot study involving 20&#xD;
      healthy volunteers who were instructed to try and make themselves unconscious that there were&#xD;
      2 cases of over sedation (of these one briefly lost verbal contact and the other required&#xD;
      supplemental oxygen only). Over sedation, however, was not demonstrated with any of the oral&#xD;
      surgery patients in the previous studies. This may have been due to a higher level of anxiety&#xD;
      in dental patients affecting response to propofol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have therefore incorporated an additional safety feature into the existing and previously&#xD;
      studied patient maintained sedation system which may further decrease or eliminate this small&#xD;
      risk of over sedation. All the above safety features are retained and in addition the patient&#xD;
      demand button will now also be used to monitor reaction time at one minutely intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that propofol slows the reaction time of a given individual and in another recent&#xD;
      study of 40 patients undergoing general anaesthesia for planned surgery using propofol, the&#xD;
      patients' reaction times were recorded both awake and during induction of anaesthesia by&#xD;
      instructing the patients to press a button as quickly as possible in response to the handset&#xD;
      vibrating. The calculated effect site (brain) concentration of propofol was increased&#xD;
      incrementally and reaction time monitored at each stage until the patient could no longer&#xD;
      press the button.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data from this study (deteriorating patient reaction time with increased brain&#xD;
      concentration of propofol) was analysed and this information used to provide an additional&#xD;
      safety feature within the system to prevent over sedation i.e. a patient's reaction time&#xD;
      deterioration by a certain percentage will prevent himself or herself being able to&#xD;
      self-administer more propofol. Furthermore the system will actually start to decrease the&#xD;
      brain concentration of propofol once the patients' reaction time becomes too slow. The&#xD;
      patient demand button will be used to monitor reaction time at one minutely intervals as well&#xD;
      as administer more propofol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hope that this will eliminate the small risk of over sedation and wish to conduct pilot&#xD;
      studies to assess the safety and efficacy of this reaction time safeguarded,&#xD;
      patient-maintained sedation system in three groups of twenty patients requiring sedation for&#xD;
      planned procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have chosen two groups of dental patients, one group having oral surgery (technically more&#xD;
      difficult dental work e.g. wisdom tooth removal) and one group having routine dentistry (e.g.&#xD;
      patients having tooth fillings who are referred for sedation due to high anxiety levels).&#xD;
      Another of our outcome measures will look at the effect of this technique on the patients'&#xD;
      anxiety levels and we believe that this technique may be beneficial in reducing anxiety&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient maintained sedation has also been studied in 20 colonoscopy patients and found to be&#xD;
      efficacious. However there were also 4 cases of slight over sedation, none of whom required&#xD;
      any intervention e.g. airway or circulatory. We hope that by incorporating the reaction time&#xD;
      safeguard that we can again eliminate this small risk.&#xD;
