      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) for the combination of imatinib mesylate,&#xD;
      capecitabine, and dacarbazine in patients with solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the overall tumor response rate to imatinib mesylate in combination with&#xD;
      capecitabine and dacarbazine as first line and second line therapy in advanced metastatic&#xD;
      medullary thyroid carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the tolerability (toxicity) of this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the median overall survival (OS) and time to progression (TTP) for patients&#xD;
      treated with this combination.&#xD;

      Phase I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imatinib mesylate is a drug that binds to certain proteins on the tumor cells, which may&#xD;
      prevent the cells from growing. Capecitabine and dacarbazine are drugs that interfere with&#xD;
      the growth of cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will begin treatment with&#xD;
      imatinib mesylate, capecitabine, and dacarbazine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will come to M. D. Anderson at least once every three weeks (21 days) for treatment. Each&#xD;
      21-day period of treatment is called a &quot;cycle&quot; of therapy. You will receive at least 3 cycles&#xD;
      of therapy (9 weeks) unless side effects are severe or the cancer grows very quickly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first group of study participants will receive lower doses of imatinib mesylate,&#xD;
      capecitabine and dacarbazine. If these doses appear to be safe, the next group of&#xD;
      participants will receive higher doses. This will continue until the highest doses that may&#xD;
      be safely given are found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take imatinib mesylate capsules by mouth once a day on Days 1-21 of each cycle.&#xD;
      Imatinib mesylate should be taken with a meal with a large glass of water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take capecitabine tablets by mouth twice a day on Days 1-14 of each cycle. You&#xD;
      should take each dose of capecitabine within 30 minutes after eating a meal. It is important&#xD;
      to take the tablets together with water and not fruit juices. Each dose of capecitabine&#xD;
      should be about 12 hours apart (for example, after breakfast and after your evening meal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a small tube (central venous line) inserted into a large vein under the skin of&#xD;
      the chest or through a vein in the arm to receive dacarbazine. Dacarbazine will be given over&#xD;
      1 hour on Days 1-3 of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first cycle of therapy, blood (about 2 ½ teaspoons) will be collected once a week&#xD;
      for routine tests. Before each new cycle of therapy, you will have a complete physical exam&#xD;
      and urine and blood (about 2 ½ teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests. You will be&#xD;
      asked to tell the study doctor about all medications you have taken since you started taking&#xD;
      the study drugs and any health problems that you may have experienced. You will also have&#xD;
      either CT scans or a MRI of the tumor(s) every 9 weeks and at the end of the study.&#xD;
      Additional tests may be done during the study if your doctor feels it is necessary for your&#xD;
      care. All tests before each new cycle of treatment and when treatment stops must be done at&#xD;
      M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You should always tell the study doctor if you are taking any other medication, if you have&#xD;
      seen another doctor, if you have received new treatments or if there is any change in the way&#xD;
      you are feeling since the last visit. If you are seeing another doctor(s), you should inform&#xD;
      these doctors that you are currently in this study. Have the doctor contact the study doctor&#xD;
      to discuss any other necessary treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you experience severe side effects, treatment may be delayed, stopped, or you may receive&#xD;
      smaller doses of the drugs. You may continue to receive treatment on this study until the&#xD;
      disease gets worse or you experience any intolerable side effects. If this happens, you will&#xD;
      be taken off the study and your doctor will discuss other treatment options with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When you stop taking part in the study, you will have blood (about 3 teaspoons) collected for&#xD;
      routine tests. You will have a physical exam and either a CT scan or a MRI to check on the&#xD;
      status of the disease. You will be contacted by phone every three months for the rest of your&#xD;
      life to check on the status of the disease and on any symptoms you may be experiencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The drugs dacarbazine, imatinib mesylate, and capecitabine&#xD;
      are FDA approved and commercially available for treating certain forms of cancer. Up to 24&#xD;
      participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imatinib mesylate is a drug that binds to certain proteins on the tumor cells, which may&#xD;
      prevent the cells from growing. Capecitabine and dacarbazine are drugs that interfere with&#xD;
      the growth of cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will begin treatment with&#xD;

             phase II portion of the trial, patients are required to have medullary thyroid&#xD;
             carcinoma that is unresectable or metastatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. For the phase I portion of the protocol, there is no limit to the amount of prior&#xD;
             therapy participants may have received. For the phase II portion of the trial, 0-1&#xD;
             prior regimens are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. ECOG performance status must be 0-2.&#xD;

             patients of reproductive potential must agree to employ an effective barrier method of&#xD;
             birth control throughout the study and for up to 3 months following discontinuation of&#xD;
             study drug.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Patients who have had chemotherapy within 3 weeks prior to entering the study or those&#xD;
             who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 28&#xD;
             days earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents, or have participated&#xD;
             in any investigational drug study within 28 days preceding start of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The teratogenic potential of this combination is currently unknown. Women who are&#xD;
             pregnant or lactating are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of any other malignancy in the last 5 years, except that patients with a prior&#xD;
             history of in situ cancer or basal or squamous cell skin cancer are eligible. Patients&#xD;
             with treated disease processes believed to be associated with MEN2, such as&#xD;
             pheochromocytomas and primary hyperparathyroidism are allowed in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Concomitant use of warfarin is not allowed. Low molecular weight and standard heparin&#xD;
             use is allowed.&#xD;
