  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a parasitic skin lesion caused by different species of Leishmania&#xD;
      and transmitted by the bite of infected sand flies. Leishmaniasis is exist in 88 countries,&#xD;
      pentavalent antimonials (sodium stibogluconate and meglumine antimoniate) have been used as a&#xD;
      standard treatment for this disease for last 80 years. Pentavalent antimonials are only&#xD;
      available as injectable, which is painful, toxic, not affordable and moreover is not always&#xD;
      effective even sometimes with several courses of treatment. Many different modalities are&#xD;
      used to treat the disease with little success. Miltefosine is drug and has recently been&#xD;
      shown to be effective in the treatment cutaneous leishmaniasis in Colombia. The molecular&#xD;
      mechanisms that contribute to this effectiveness are not clearly understood. Only a well&#xD;
      designed, randomized clinical trial can precisely evaluate the efficacy of any therapeutic&#xD;
      modalities in cutaneous leishmaniasis. In this study the efficacy of oral treatment of&#xD;
      miltefosine 2.5 mg per Kg body weight for 4 weeks will be compared with standard treatment of&#xD;
      intramuscular injections of 60 mg/kg/day glucantime for 2 weeks in ACL parasitologically&#xD;
      proven patients. At 8 weeks after the initiation of the treatment any patient in the group&#xD;
      who received miltefosine and has not responded to the treatment will be treated with the&#xD;
      standard intramuscular injections of 60 mg/kg/day glucantime for 2 weeks. The clinical trial&#xD;
      will be carried out according to the International approved GCP (Good Clinical Practice)&#xD;
      guide lines.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Leishmaniasis caused by at least 20 different species of Leishmania and transmitted by the&#xD;
      bite of infected sand flies. Leishmaniasis is endemic in 88 countries, mostly developing&#xD;
      ones. Leishmaniasis with an incidence rate of 1.5-2 million mostly cutaneous form, and 350&#xD;
      million population at risk is a major health problem in some endemic countries such as Iran&#xD;
      which is endemic to cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), both anthroponotic CL (ACL) caused by L.&#xD;
      tropica and Zoonotic CL (ZCL) caused by L. major 1, 2. Pentavalent antimonials (sodium&#xD;
      stibogluconate and meglumine antimoniate) have been used as standard treatment of&#xD;
      leishmaniasis for about 80 years. Pentavalent antimonials are only parentrally available,&#xD;
      which is painful, toxic, not affordable in most endemic areas and moreover is not always&#xD;
      effective even sometimes with several courses of treatment, recently resistance of Leishmania&#xD;
      to antimonials is reported. Other modalities such as physical, immunological, topical and&#xD;
      systemic therapies are used with controversial results 3,4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Miltefosine, is a phosphocholine analogue that affects cell-signaling pathways and membrane&#xD;
      synthesis 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Almost all strains of mice are resistant to L. major and L. mexicana infection, in ressitant&#xD;
      strain L. major infection induces a transient self healing lesion similar to human CL&#xD;
      accompanies with a Th1 response but susceptible BALB/c mice infected with L. major induces a&#xD;
      Th2 type immune response and the infection develop to a systemic form of disease similar to&#xD;
      human Kala azar and eventually every mouse is succumed to the disease. Miltefosine has&#xD;
      recently been shown to be effective in the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) caused by&#xD;
      L. donovani and New World CL caused by L. vianna panamensis in Colombia 6-8. The results of&#xD;
      an open-label, multicenteric, phase II trial of different doses of oral miltefosine (4 or 6&#xD;
      weeks) on patients with VL caused by L. donovani in India showed a cure rate of 95% (all 120&#xD;
      patients showed an initial parasitologic cure and relapsed was seen in only 6 patients) 6. In&#xD;
      another randomized, open trial in India, VL patients received miltefosine orally&#xD;
      (approximately 2.5 mg/kg daily for 28 days), or amphotericin B (1 mg/kg, every other day for&#xD;
      30 days) at the end of the treatment, parasitological cure rate was 100% and only 6% of the&#xD;
      patients received miltefosien showed relapse by 6 months 7. Phase I-II of an open dose&#xD;
      escalating trial of miltefosine against American CL in Colombia showed that oral miltefosine&#xD;
      is safe and the cure rate was 66 and 94% for different doses 8. In a placebo-controlled trial&#xD;
      of miltefosine in Colombia and Guatemala, American CL caused by L. v. panamensis was treated&#xD;
      with miltfosine (2.5 mg/kg per day orally for 28 days), at the end of the teatment period,&#xD;
      the per-protocol cure rates for miltefosine group was 91% and for placebo group was 38% 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The molecular mechanisms that contribute to the antileishmanial activity of miltefosine are&#xD;
      not clearly understood but apparently the effect is not on immune response and macrophages&#xD;
      since immunodefient mice such as SCID mice and other deficient mice are still susceptible to&#xD;
      miltefosine action 10-12. It is shown that miltefosine induces nuclear DNA condensation and&#xD;
      apoptosis-like death in L. donovani 12-14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The controversy obsereved in the reports of the efficacy of different modalities for CL is&#xD;
      mainly due to not considering the self healing nature of the disease in the design of the&#xD;
      study. Factors such as variations in the susceptibility of different Leishmania species to&#xD;
      the various drugs and differences in the criteria used to evaluate the efficacy of the drugs&#xD;
      are important. Although no reliable report is available on the efficacy of glucantime in the&#xD;
      treatment of ACL caused by L. tropica but surely the efficacy is very poor, and resistant of&#xD;
      L. tropica to glucantime exist (manuscript submitted). Only with well designed, randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial can precisely evaluate the efficacy of any therapeutic modalities in CL. In&#xD;
      this study the efficacy of oral treatment of miltefosine 2.5 mg per Kg body weight for 4&#xD;
      weeks will be compared with standard treatment of intramuscular injections of 60 mg/kg/day&#xD;
      glucantime for 2 weeks in ACL parasitologically proven patients. At 8 weeks after the&#xD;
      initiation of the treatment any patient in the group who received miltefosine and has not&#xD;
      responded to the treatment will be treated with the standard intramuscular injections of 60&#xD;
      mg/kg/day glucantime for 2 weeks. The clinical trial will be carried out according to GCP&#xD;
      (Good Clinical Practice) guide lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study area/setting: (Instructions: describe the area or setting where the study will be&#xD;
      conducted. This description should cover the details relevant to the study topic) Study site:&#xD;
      There are two sites of ACL with high incidence rate in Iran; one is Mashad, Khorasan and the&#xD;
      second one is Bam, Kerman, the incidence rate of ACL in Bam is increasing after earthquake&#xD;
      according to a recent survey which is currently underway. The trial will be carried out in&#xD;
      either site with enough number of ACL patients, but also to complete the recruitment faster&#xD;
      the trial could be carried out in both sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2 Study subjects: (Instructions: eligibility and exclusion criteria of the study subjects)&#xD;
      I) Inclusion criteria:a) Parasitologically proven cases of CL based on positive smear and/or&#xD;
      culture; b) Otherwise healthy subjects on the basis of medical history, physical examination&#xD;

      function tests [RFT]); c) Age 12-50 years; d) body weight more than 40 kilograms; e) willing&#xD;
      to participate in the study and sign the informed consent (by the patient or his/her&#xD;
      parent/guardian in case of younger than 18 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II) Exclusion criteria: a) Pregnant or lactating women; b) Duration of lesion more than 6&#xD;
      months; c) Number of lesions more than 5; d) Lesion(s) with bacterial supperinfection e)&#xD;

      any drug trials in the last 60 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III) Withdrawal criteria:a) A serious adverse event occurs; b) Withdrawal of the consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawn cases will be treated according to the investigators opinion and beneficial of the&#xD;
      patients at no cost. All withdrawn patients will be evaluated in final analysis&#xD;
      (intent-to-treat analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV) Treatment: In this phase III, randomized open trial, subjects meeting inclusion criteria&#xD;
      of the trial will be randomly allocated into two groups according to a randomization list.&#xD;
      One group will be treated with 2.5 mg/kg body weight of oral miltefosine and the second group&#xD;
      will be treated with intramuscular injections of 60 mg/kg/day glucantime for 2 weeks. The&#xD;
      oral miltefosine tablets will be delivered to each patient on days 0, 7, 14 and 21. A written&#xD;
      instruction sheet will be given to each included patient, and the patient will be instructed&#xD;
      to contact the research team on appearance of symptoms suggesting severe side effects&#xD;
      (intractable diarrhea and/or vomiting, symtoms of liver, kidney or hematopoietic system&#xD;
      dysfunction. A copy of the randomization list with the codes will be kept at WR office. Eight&#xD;
      weeks after the initiatin of the treatment, any patient who received oral miltefosine and has&#xD;
      active lesion will be treated with intramuscular glucantime injections (60mg/kg/day for 14&#xD;
      days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      v) Follow-up: Every included patient will be visited at 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 24 weeks after the&#xD;
      initiation of the treatment. The flow chart is attached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.3 Study design: (Instructions: mention the type of study design eg cross-sectional,&#xD;
      case-control, intervention study, etc..) This trial is an open randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      under GCP guide lines. The Center academic staffs are well qualified in training of GCP&#xD;
      nationally and internationally, several clinical trials both in therapeutic and vaccine&#xD;
      development have been completed by this group..&#xD;
&#xD;
      v) Follow-up: The patients will be visited at 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 24 weeks after the initiation&#xD;
      of the treatment. The flow chart is attached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.3 Study design: (Instructions: mention the type of study design eg cross-sectional,&#xD;
      case-control, intervention study, etc..) This study is a randomized, open clinical trial&#xD;
      under GCP guide lines. The Center academic staff are well qualified in training of GCP&#xD;
      nationally and internationally and have completed several clinical trials in both therapeutic&#xD;
      and vaccine efficacy trials under GCP guide lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cutaneous leishmaniasis: Skin lesions clinically suspicious and parasitologically proven by&#xD;
      direct smear and/or culture. The study area is endemic for ACL but a portion of the&#xD;
      Leishmania isolates will be used for charecterization and identification using monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies and PCR technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical cure: The primary clinical efficacy parameter will be the complete re-epithelization&#xD;
      of all lesions with disappearance of induration (with or without scar). No parasitological&#xD;
      evaluation will be done on clinically cured lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical improvement: Reduction in the size of ulcer and induration. Treatment failure: No&#xD;
      change or increase in the size of induration and ulcer. Relapse: Reappearance of the lesion&#xD;
      at the site or periphery of the cured lesion will be considered as relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parasitological cure: Negative smear and culture at the end of the treatment and follow up&#xD;
      period will be regarded as parasitological cure.&#xD;
