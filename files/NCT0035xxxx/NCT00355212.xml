  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ethanol injection has been for many years the standard approach as percutaneous treatment of&#xD;
      non-surgical early hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhotic patients. Radiofrequency ablation&#xD;
      has been proposed as an alternative approach and some retrospective and prospective&#xD;
      comparative trials indicated its better performance for the local control of the disease in&#xD;
      comparison to ethanol injection. Some prospective randomized studies from Japan and from&#xD;
      Taiwan reported also an increase of overall survival in the patients treated by&#xD;
      Radiofrequency. Aim of this study is to compare the two techniques in a prospective&#xD;
      randomized trial in western patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Currently early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) complicating liver cirrhosis is often treated&#xD;
      by percutaneous ablation techniques under ultrasound guidance: their performance is easy,&#xD;
      safe and efficient. They are less invasive and expensive than surgical removal, representing&#xD;
      a potential local cure for a larger number of patients than those who could be treated by a&#xD;
      liver resection or offered a liver transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), the first non-surgical technique introduced in clinical&#xD;
      practice, has been widely used since the late eighties. PEI induces a chemical and ischemic&#xD;
      coagulative necrosis in 70-80% of small (&lt;3cm) HCC lesions. Necrosis obtained by this way is&#xD;
      generally restricted to the neoplastic lesion itself; the chemical ablation may be moreover&#xD;
      hampered by internal scars, that limit the uniform spreading of ethanol and by possible&#xD;
      uncontrolled flows outside the lesion, with the ultimate result of a reduced necrotic effect&#xD;
      and persistence of residual vital nests of neoplasia in as many as 33% of the cases.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, the survival after PEI seems not different from surgery in retrospective series&#xD;
      and this technique was indicated as the standard percutaneous treatment for early HCC in the&#xD;
      2001 guidelines of the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1993 radio-frequency ablation (RF) was proposed as a new technique for the ablation of&#xD;
      small HCCs. RF induces heat-generated coagulative necrosis of the neoplastic lesion and&#xD;
      surrounding liver tissue. However, RF is not suitable for lesions situated close to large&#xD;
      vessels or hollow viscera, as the first can decrease heat generation and the latter can be&#xD;
      damaged by the procedure itself; it is more cumbersome, needs anaesthesiology assistance in&#xD;
      most of the cases and, accordingly to early reports, is aggravated by a higher complication&#xD;
      rate and higher costs. A major advantage of RF is the achievement of complete ablation of the&#xD;
      neoplastic lesion with less sessions than PEI. This advantage impacts on the &quot;quality of&#xD;
      life&quot; of the patient, who prefers to be cured in a single session rather than by the&#xD;
      multisession approach of PEI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the present study began in January 2001, no randomised controlled trial comparing RF and&#xD;
      PEI had been published and no data were available on mid-long term local tumor progression&#xD;
      and on comparative survival rate after either treatment. Some retrospective studies about the&#xD;
      primary effectiveness had been published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study was to compare the effectiveness of RF versus PEI in a randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial: our primary end point was to evaluate the local control (sustained complete&#xD;
      response) after 1 year from the treatment of every lesion defined as HCC in the single&#xD;
      patient at the beginning of the trial; secondary end points included the primary&#xD;
      effectiveness (early complete response)of the treatment after 1-2 months,the overall survival&#xD;
      at four years, the complication rate, and the costs.&#xD;
