  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate whether the drug D-cycloserine (DCS) can improve a type of learning&#xD;
      called classical conditioning, in which the brain learns to associate neutral stimuli with&#xD;
      stimuli that elicit emotional or physiological responses. DCS is an antibiotic that was&#xD;
      initially approved to treat tuberculosis and has been tested in clinical trials over the last&#xD;
      decade for enhancing cognitive function. This protocol includes both a pilot study and a main&#xD;
      study. The main study will begin after the pilot study ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 45 years of age may be eligible for these studies.&#xD;
      Candidates will be screened with a medical and psychiatric history and a physical examination&#xD;
      that includes blood and urine samples, an electrocardiogram (EKG), hearing test and startle&#xD;
      test. The startle test involves recording eyeblink responses to loud noises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the screening visit, those enrolled will participate in the pilot or main study, in&#xD;
      which their reactions to two types of stimuli-an unpleasant, but harmless, shock to the arm&#xD;
      and a mild puff of air to the eye-will be measured and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Pilot Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 1 - Participants will receive very brief electric shocks delivered through two&#xD;
      electrodes attached to the forearm or fingers and will hear brief loud sounds that may&#xD;
      startle. Geometric shapes will be presented on a computer monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sessions 2 and 3 - The procedure is the same as in session 1, except participants will also&#xD;
      be subjected to brief low-intensity tones and airpuffs to the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Main Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo the same procedures described in the pilot study, with the&#xD;
      following additions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will have an intravenous tube placed in a vein for collecting blood during the&#xD;
           test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will take a pill each test day that contains either 100 mg DCS, 500 mg DCS, or a&#xD;
           placebo (inactive substance). Subjects assigned to receive DCS will get the active drug&#xD;
           on only one of the three test sessions and will be given placebo the other two sessions.&#xD;
           The placebo group will receive placebo all three sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both the pilot and main study, subjects' physiological responses to the stimuli will be&#xD;
      recorded. Electrodes will be placed on two fingers (to measure sweat, or electrodermal&#xD;
      activity), on the ribcage midway between the waist and armpit (to measure heart rate), and&#xD;
      under one eye (to measure eye blink). Pulse will be recorded with a device attached to a&#xD;
      finger, and breathing rate will be recorded with a special belt placed around the chest. At&#xD;
      various times during the sessions, subjects will fill out questionnaires about their&#xD;
      experience. Participants may withdraw from the study at any point.&#xD;

      This protocol examines the effect of two drugs on fear conditioning. Study 1 tests assess&#xD;
      whether D-cycloserine (DCS) facilitates extinction of fear conditioning and acquisition of&#xD;
      eyeblink conditioning. Study 2 examines whether the calcium channel blocker nimodipine blocks&#xD;
      acquisition of fear conditioning and eyeblink conditioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1: The demonstration that activation of NMDA receptors is necessary for long-term&#xD;
      potentiation suggests that this subclass of amino acid may be involved in certain types of&#xD;
      learning and memory. The present project will examine the effect DCS, a partial agonist at&#xD;
      the glycine modulatory site on the NMDA receptor, on two associative learning tasks,&#xD;
      extinction of fear conditioning and acquisition of eyeblink conditioning. The inability to&#xD;
      extinguish intense fear memories is a significant clinical problem. Finding procedures or&#xD;
      treatments that facilitate extinction of fear memories is of paramount importance. In&#xD;
      animals, extinction of conditioned fear involves an active learning process that is blocked&#xD;
      by NMDA antagonists. Recently, Dr. Michael Davis (Emory University) demonstrated that the&#xD;
      administration of DCS prior to extinction produces a dose-dependent facilitation of&#xD;
      extinction of conditioned fear in the rat, when assessed with fear-potentiated startle. We&#xD;
      propose to examine whether the clinically important process of extinction can also be&#xD;
      enhanced by DCS in humans. Another aim of the study is to examine whether DCS facilitates a&#xD;
      hippocampal-mediated task, trace eyeblink conditioning. The hippocampus is particularly rich&#xD;
      in NMDA receptors and DCS blocks trace eyeblink conditioning in the rabbit. The present study&#xD;
      will examine the effect of placebo, 100 mg DCS, and 500 mg DCS on extinction, retention, and&#xD;
      reinstatement of fear-potentiated startle conditioning and acquisition of trace eyeblink&#xD;
      conditioning. The first experimental session (acquisition) will be a fear conditioning&#xD;
      procedure (paired presentation of a conditioned stimulus or CS and a mildly unpleasant&#xD;
      shock). During the second experimental session (extinction), DCS or placebo will be given to&#xD;
      the subjects 1 hour prior to an extinction procedure (CS presented without shock). Following&#xD;
      extinction, the eyeblink conditioning study will be conducted. Finally, in the third&#xD;
      experimental session, retention of fear and eyeblink conditioning will be evaluated. We&#xD;
      hypothesized that compared to placebo, DCS will speed up learning, i.e., it will facilitate&#xD;
      extinction of fear conditioning and acquisition of eyeblink conditioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2: The rationale for testing nimodipine is highly similar to the rationale for testing&#xD;
      DCS, and the procedure is very similar. Understanding the neurochemical bases of fear&#xD;
      acquisition and fear extinction may provide insights into pathological anxiety and help&#xD;
      develop more effective treatments. This study will be conducted over two experimental&#xD;
      sessions (and a screening session). Nimodipine or placebo will be given during the 1st&#xD;
      session prior to acquisition of fear conditioning and eyeblink conditioning. The 2nd session&#xD;
      will be a test of retention of eyeblink conditioning. We hypothesized that nimodipine will&#xD;
      impair fear conditioning and eyeblink conditioning.&#xD;
