  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well ispinesib works in treating patients with metastatic&#xD;
      or unresectable kidney cancer. Ispinesib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some&#xD;
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the efficacy of SB-715992 in patients with advanced renal cell cancer who have&#xD;
      received at least one prior therapy. This will be achieved by a multi-center, single arm&#xD;
      phase II study to evaluate the proportion of patients who achieve a complete or partial&#xD;
      response with this agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the overall survival. II. To assess the time to progression. III. To evaluate&#xD;
      the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ispinesib (SB-715992) IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat&#xD;
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 3 years.&#xD;
