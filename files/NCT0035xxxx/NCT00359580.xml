  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to identify the genes responsible for several inherited&#xD;
      disorders commonly seen in the Amish and Mennonite populations and learn more about the&#xD;
      natural history (medical problems that develop over time) of these disorders. In addition,&#xD;
      researchers will establish a computer database containing Amish genealogies, derived largely&#xD;
      from the community s extensive records of births, marriages, deaths, etc., that will help&#xD;
      construct pedigrees (family trees) for genetic study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Amish and Mennonite peoples have a high rate of intermarriage within their individual&#xD;
      communities, with a resulting high incidence of inherited disorders. Many of these disorders,&#xD;
      such as cartilage-hair hypoplasia, Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, and others, are rarely seen&#xD;
      outside these communities. New research using state-of-the-art methodologies in genetics will&#xD;
      add to current knowledge about the causes and symptoms of these disorders that will&#xD;
      eventually aid in their diagnosis and medical management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with inherited disorders that occur frequently in the Amish and Mennonite&#xD;
      populations and their family members may be eligible for this study. Individuals from both&#xD;
      within and outside these communities may enroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be evaluated with a review of their medical records and their personal and&#xD;
      family medical history and a brief physical examination. A small tissue sample will be&#xD;
      collected for genetic studies. This will be either a blood sample (3 teaspoons from adults&#xD;
      and 1 to 3 teaspoons from children, depending on their size) or a mouth swab (cells removed&#xD;
      from inside the cheek by gentle brushing). Some participants may undergo additional&#xD;
      procedures, such as diagnostic X-rays, brain scans, echocardiogram (heart ultrasound) or&#xD;
      other studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If genetic testing shows a gene change (mutation), the participant will be notified to that&#xD;
      effect in writing and offered counseling in their home regarding the test results and their&#xD;
      implications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Amish and Mennonite populations represent outstanding communities for the study of&#xD;
      genetic disease for a number of reasons. There is a high degree of inbreeding, resulting in a&#xD;
      high frequency of recessive disorders, many of which are seen rarely or are unknown outside&#xD;
      of this population. Extensive genealogical records are available, and the average family size&#xD;
      is large. This proposal includes a number of collaborators who have had extremely close,&#xD;
      extensive interaction with the Lancaster County Amish over the past decade; their&#xD;
      relationships with the community are invaluable to the success of this project. We have had&#xD;
      substantial success with this research over the past seven years, leading to the discovery of&#xD;
      the molecular etiology of four human diseases and the establishment of a useful database and&#xD;
      tools for genealogical analysis. We propose to continue this line of research to further&#xD;
      characterize these disorders and identify additional ones, as well as enlarging a&#xD;
      computerized Anabaptist genealogy.&#xD;
