  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study has been designed to comparatively evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the&#xD;
      PAS-Port Proximal Anastomosis System and conventional suturing techniques for creation of the&#xD;
      connection between graft veins and the aorta in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass&#xD;
      graft surgery for treatment of coronary artery disease. Patients in the study will have a&#xD;
      coronary angiogram approximately 9 months following surgery to determine the patency of vein&#xD;
      grafts created using either the automated PAS-Port or hand sewn methods. Safety will be&#xD;
      evaluated by documenting the occurence of adverse clinical events and evealuating possible&#xD;
      association with either method.&#xD;
