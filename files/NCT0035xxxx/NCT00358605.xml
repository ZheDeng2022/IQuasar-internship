  <brief_title>The Use of Oral Appliances as an Adjunct to Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) in the Treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnoea</brief_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at whether patients with OSAHS already successfully treated with nasal&#xD;
      CPAP could successfully use an oral appliance as a short-term treatment alternative and&#xD;
      whether patients who could use an oral appliance as an alternative would actually avail of&#xD;
      its use, and to assess their preference in terms of treatment modality. The combination of&#xD;
      therapies if tolerated, will allow greater flexibility of treatment and opportunity for&#xD;
      ongoing compliance in circumstances where CPAP cannot be used.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each patient will undergo a detailed history and physical examination with particular&#xD;
      attention to symptoms related to sleep disorders, cardiovascular disease, medications, motor&#xD;
      vehicle accidents, occupation and change in symptoms. Weight, height and neck circumference&#xD;
      will be measured and BMI calculated and compared to previous measurements recorded in the&#xD;
      medical chart. The research question we are exploring is whether the oral appliance approach&#xD;
      is better in terms of successful treatment, compliance with treatment, safety and quality of&#xD;
      life when compared to the conventional CPAP therapy in OSAHS. It is a cross over design.&#xD;
      Consecutive patients who&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  meet the eligibility criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  agree to a trial of therapy with the oral appliance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  give informed consent will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria - stable on C-PAP for at least 3 months, and Previous diagnostic&#xD;
      polysomnography within 2 years, and Pre-treatment AHI 10-30 ( mild-moderate sleep apnea), and&#xD;
      Compliance &gt; 4hrs per night, and Are willing and able to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria - AHI &gt;30, or Oxygen Saturation &lt; 85% for &gt; 10% of study time during&#xD;
      previous diagnostic PSG, Or less than 8 teeth per jaw Or not enough teeth in good periodontal&#xD;
      health to allow retention of the appliance, Operates heavy machinery or motor vehicle as part&#xD;
      of job, or Clinical evidence of severe tempero-mandibular joint dysfunction, or Previous&#xD;
      Motor Vehicle Crash assoc. with sleepiness, or Major cardiovascular morbidity, or Medically&#xD;
      complicated or medically unstable. Thirty patients will be recruited over a period of 1 year.&#xD;
      Prior to treatment baseline ESS and SAQLI will be recorded. Physical attributes will be&#xD;
      recorded and if BMI and neck circumference are unchanged from pre-treatment records PSG will&#xD;
      be deemed unnecessary at this point. Baseline RDI, and snoring index off treatment, will be&#xD;
      recorded using portable snoresat monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will visit the dental clinic for fitting and adjustment of the Klearway&#xD;
      appliance. The appliance will be advanced under supervision of the clinic and patients will&#xD;
      be assessed at intervals of 2-4 weeks. Titration will be assessed clinically based on patient&#xD;
      sleepiness, snoring, comfort, and maximal jaw adjustment. Snoresat monitoring will be&#xD;
      repeated while wearing the appliance in the optimal position to ensure adequate titration.&#xD;
      Once titration has been completed the patient will be asked to wear the appliance exclusively&#xD;
      for a period of at least 7 days. Full PSG will be recorded after 7 days while using the&#xD;
      appliance. ESS will be measured at the time of PSG. Treatment efficacy at this point will&#xD;
      determine safety to continue using the appliance. Treatment failure will be defined as an ESS&#xD;
      &gt;4 over baseline an AHI of &gt;20 or &gt; 50% of pre-treatment baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be seen and reassessed and informed of sleep study results. Patients able to&#xD;
      use the appliance safely will be asked to continue to use their OSA treatments individually&#xD;
      and will be allowed to decide themselves which mode of therapy they will use each night.&#xD;
      Patients will keep a daily diary recording use of treatment modality, length of time worn and&#xD;
      also location (home, vacation etc). At the end of the study patients will be seen and diaries&#xD;
      collected. Satisfaction levels will assessed and side effects recorded. Objective CPAP&#xD;
      compliance will be analysed by downloading CPAP machines. Future treatment preference in&#xD;
      terms of either treatment or a combination will be recorded.&#xD;
