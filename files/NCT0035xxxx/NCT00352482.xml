  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disease that affects an individual's&#xD;
      ability to breathe. Currently, no medications can reverse the damage to the lungs caused by&#xD;
      IPF, but individuals are encouraged to engage in moderate exercise to strengthen lung&#xD;
      function. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of sildenafil at improving exercise&#xD;
      tolerance and breathing difficulties in individuals with IPF.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IPF is a disease that damages the air sacs in the lungs and leads to widespread and permanent&#xD;
      scarring of lung tissue. Individuals with IPF may experience breathing difficulties, cough,&#xD;
      chest pain, and a decreased exercise capacity. There is no cure for this disease, and&#xD;
      individuals usually die within 3 to 5 years. It is recommended that individuals with IPF&#xD;
      engage in moderate exercise, as this can help maintain strength and improve lung function.&#xD;
      Many individuals with IPF also suffer from pulmonary hypertension, which is high blood&#xD;
      pressure in the arteries leading to the lungs. Sildenafil, a medication currently used to&#xD;
      treat pulmonary hypertension, increases blood flow to the lungs and enhances gas exchange&#xD;
      within the lungs. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of sildenafil at&#xD;
      improving exercise tolerance and breathing difficulties in individuals with IPF and pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This 3-week study will enroll individuals with IPF and pulmonary hypertension. Study visits&#xD;
      will occur at baseline, and Weeks 1 and 2. At the baseline visit, participants will perform a&#xD;
      6-minute walk test, which will measure the distance walked in a 6-minute period. Oxygen&#xD;
      levels will be measured prior to and during the test, and standardized questionnaires will be&#xD;
      completed to assess breathing difficulties. A second 6-minute walk test will be performed 1&#xD;
      hour following the first test. At the Week 1 visit, participants will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive a single dose of either 50 mg of sildenafil or placebo. One hour after receiving the&#xD;
      medication, they will complete another 6-minute walk test. The Week 2 visit will be identical&#xD;
      to the Week 1 visit, except participants who received sildenafil at Week 1 will receive&#xD;
      placebo at Week 2, and vice versa.&#xD;
