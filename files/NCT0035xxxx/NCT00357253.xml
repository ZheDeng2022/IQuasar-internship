      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in different ways to stop&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.&#xD;
      Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Capecitabine may make tumor&#xD;
      cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Giving capecitabine together with radiation&#xD;
      therapy may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of capecitabine when&#xD;
      given together with radiation therapy in treating young patients with newly diagnosed,&#xD;
      nonmetastatic brain stem glioma or high-grade glioma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate the maximum tolerated dose of capecitabine rapidly disintegrating tablets (RDT)&#xD;
           administered concurrently with radiotherapy in young patients with newly diagnosed,&#xD;
           nondisseminated intrinsic brain stem glioma or high-grade glioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the dose-limiting toxicity in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the safety profile of this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterize the pharmacokinetics of capecitabine RDT in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore the exposure-response relationship for measures of safety and effectiveness&#xD;
           using pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the antitumor activity of this regimen observed in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate distributions of progression-free survival and survival in patients treated&#xD;
           with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterize radiographic changes in tumor, using MRI, perfusion and diffusion MRI, and&#xD;
           positron emission tomography (PET) scans, in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This a multicenter, dose-escalation study of capecitabine rapidly disintegrating&#xD;
      tablets (RDT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for approximately 6 weeks. Beginning&#xD;
      within 24 hours of starting radiotherapy, patients also receive oral capecitabine RDT twice&#xD;
      daily on days 1-21. Treatment with capecitabine RDT repeats every 21 days for 3 courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of capecitabine RDT until the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2&#xD;
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning in week 12, patients receive capecitabine RDT at a fixed dose twice daily on days&#xD;
      1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo blood collection periodically during course 1 for pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      correlative studies. Patients also undergo MRI, and rapid perfusion/diffusion MRI at baseline&#xD;
      and periodically during study for radiographic correlative studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;

    <description>This is a dose escalation study. 375, 500, 650, or 850 mg/m2 capecitabine RDT is given orally daily in two divided doses approximately 12 hours apart beginning at the start of radiation therapy and continuing for 9 weeks. After a two week break, patients receive twice daily oral capecitabine, either 900 mg/m2 or 1250 mg/m2, approximately 12 hours apart for 14 days followed by a 7-day rest period for a total of 3 courses.</description>
