      This study will explore whether an antibody is influencing the autonomic nervous system, and&#xD;
      if its removal will eliminate signs and symptoms of failure in that system. The autonomic&#xD;
      nervous system is responsible for many automatic changes involved in everyday activities,&#xD;
      such as standing up, digesting food, and exercising in the heat. Antibodies fight germs but&#xD;
      sometimes cause health problems. Removal of the antibody is done through a procedure called a&#xD;
      plasma exchange.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with primary chronic autonomic failure and a circulating antibody to what is called&#xD;
      the neuronal nicotinic receptor may be eligible for this study. To be eligible, patients will&#xD;
      have participated in an earlier study, protocol number 03-N-0004. Patients will undergo tests&#xD;
      and procedures that include an electrocardiogram, and blood collection for hepatitis, HIV,&#xD;
      and pregnancy. Blood will be tested for a complete blood count, clotting factors, and&#xD;
      chemistries. There will also be tests for liver function, kidney function, cortisol, and&#xD;
      thyroid. Participants will be tested for signs and symptoms of autonomic failure, and will be&#xD;
      asked to complete questionnaires about various symptoms before the plasma exchange, 1 or 2&#xD;
      weeks afterward, and then monthly or bimonthly for up to 1 year. Patients will undergo a&#xD;
      series of other tests. In one test, a patient is upright and blows against a resistance&#xD;
      (Valsalva maneuver). The quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test (QSART) uses iontophoresis,&#xD;
      involving application of acetylcholine, a chemical messenger, and a small amount of&#xD;
      electricity. QSART examines the regulation of sweating, a particular aspect of the autonomic&#xD;
      nervous system. There will be a test using edrophonium, given intravenously (IV), to evaluate&#xD;
      that drug's effects on the heart, skin, glands, gastrointestinal activity, bladder tone, and&#xD;
      salivation. A glucagon test, also by IV, will show patients' ability to release the hormone&#xD;
      adrenaline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plasma exchange will be performed by use of an automated cell separator. Patients' blood&#xD;
      will be removed continuously through a needle in the arm. Blood cells will be separated from&#xD;
      the plasma by a spinning process and continuously returned to circulation through a needle in&#xD;
      the patients' opposite arm. Blood cells that are returned will be mixed with albumin, a&#xD;
      sterile replacement solution. A blood thinner, citrate, will be given, to prevent clotting of&#xD;
      blood. This whole procedure will take about 2 hours. Patients will typically undergo five&#xD;
      exchange procedures in about 10 days while they are inpatients at the NIH Clinical Center.&#xD;
      The amount of plasma removed in a single session and the number of sessions will be set by&#xD;
      the NIH Blood Bank. It is expected that patients' autonomic failure will improve after&#xD;
      several days of starting the plasma exchange. Testing for symptoms of autonomic failure and&#xD;
      autonomic function testing will occur about 1 month after the plasma exchange and monthly or&#xD;
      bimonthly for up to 1 year. For each visit of testing, patients will be inpatients for about&#xD;
      2 days. If autonomic failure recurs, patients may have a second plasma exchange, with the&#xD;
      same follow-up tests, for about 1 year.&#xD;

      Background: Until recently, it was thought that primary chronic autonomic failure occurring&#xD;
      without central neurodegeneration (pure autonomic failure, PAF) reflected diffuse loss of&#xD;
      catecholamine-producing cells (sympathetic noradrenergic nerves and adrenomedullary&#xD;
      chromaffin cells) outside the brain. Rarely, however, PAF patients have clinical laboratory&#xD;
      findings suggesting decreased post-ganglionic nerve traffic in intact autonomic nerves,&#xD;
      rather than denervation. To date, all of four such patients have also had a high titer of a&#xD;
      circulating antibody to the nicotinic receptor mediating ganglionic neurotransmission. In one&#xD;
      case, studied by another group, plasma exchange reversed signs and symptoms of autonomic&#xD;
      failure, consistent with the antibody being pathogenic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: In this Protocol, we will carry out plasma exchange in patients we identify as&#xD;
      having PAF, intact cardiac noradrenergic innervation, and a circulating antibody to the&#xD;
      neuronal nicotinic receptor, to determine whether antibody pathogenicity is a consistent&#xD;
      finding in this condition. We will assess the extent of relationship between symptoms, signs,&#xD;
      and clinical laboratory indices of autonomic function with the titer of the antibody and&#xD;
      obtain abundant plasma for antibody characterization and target protein identification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Autonomic function testing will be done before plasma exchange, 1-2 weeks after&#xD;
      plasma exchange, and monthly or bi-monthly thereafter for up to one year. Plasma exchange may&#xD;
      be repeated once, when symptoms of autonomic failure return as the antibody level builds up,&#xD;
      to verify in individual patients whether repetition of plasma exchange produces reproducible&#xD;
      amelioration of clinical and laboratory measures of autonomic failure.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The subjects have primary chronic autonomic failure, intact cardiac sympathetic&#xD;
        innervation, and a circulating antibody to the nicotinic cholinergic receptor mediating&#xD;
        ganglionic neurotransmission. This triad will be identified based on results of&#xD;
        participation in NIH Clinical Protocol 03-N-0004.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects are excluded if they do not meet all three of the above Inclusion Criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Venous Access Candidate subjects are excluded if there is inadequate peripheral venous&#xD;
        access, identified during participation in NIH Clinical Protocol 03-N-0004.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Abnormal Clinical Pathology Test Results Candidate subjects are excluded based on abnormal&#xD;
        Clinical Pathology results identified during participation in NIH Clinical Protocol&#xD;
        03-N-0004 (platelet count less than 100,000 per microliter, HIV-1 or 2 or chronic hepatitis&#xD;
        B or C infection, or pregnancy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Medical Risk Candidate subjects are excluded for safety reasons if, in the opinion of the&#xD;
        Associate Investigator of the NIH Department of Transfusion Medicine (DTM), therapeutic&#xD;
        plasma exchange would pose an excessive risk of complications (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage,&#xD;
        infection) outweighing the potential scientific and clinical benefit. In female patients&#xD;
        with child-bearing potential, a blood test for pregnancy is done prior to testing on each&#xD;
        visit. The finding of a positive test for pregnancy excludes the patient from further&#xD;
        participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with autonomic failure have an increased risk of hypotension in response to&#xD;
        manipulations that decrease venous return to the heart, such as plasma exchanges. Patients&#xD;
        with autonomic failure typically also have high blood pressure when they are lying down. We&#xD;
        expect that at the beginning of plasma exchanges, the blood pressure will be relatively&#xD;
        high, and the plasma exchanges may be started with the patient in a sitting position. The&#xD;
        Principal Investigator or one of the other Associate Investigators of the Clinical&#xD;
        Neurocardiology Section will monitor the blood pressure frequently or continuously during&#xD;
        the plasma exchanges. Patients with autonomic failure often tolerate remarkably low blood&#xD;
        pressure. A systolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg will be the threshold for intervening. The&#xD;
        first intervention will be to place the patient in a supine position. Second, we would&#xD;
        administer saline and albumin and slow down the rate of or stop the plasma exchange. Drugs&#xD;
        to control blood pressure will also be on hand for immediate emergency use if needed. If we&#xD;
        think that we cannot prevent low blood pressure and fainting during future plasma&#xD;
        exchanges, then we would exclude the patient from further plasma exchanges under this&#xD;
        Protocol. If uncontrollable hypotension occurs in a second patient, then the Protocol will&#xD;
        be terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients are tested for hepatitis and for HIV before undergoing plasma exchange. Blood from&#xD;
        people with hepatitis or HIV can contaminate the Blood Bank equipment. If a subject has&#xD;
        hepatitis or HIV, the subject will be excluded from further participation in the study. The&#xD;
        Consent Form includes standard consent language about HIV testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age - The Protocol is restricted to subjects at least 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Medications - Medications likely to interfere with the scientific results will be&#xD;
        discontinued on an inpatient basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Termination of Participation - A subject may refuse certain tests or procedures, or may&#xD;
        terminate participation early, without loss of benefits to which the subject was previously&#xD;
        entitled. The Investigators may also exclude a subject from further participation, such as&#xD;
        in the event of known or suspect falsification of medical history information or refusal to&#xD;
        undergo planned tests or procedures, without loss of benefits to which the subject was&#xD;
        previously entitled.&#xD;
