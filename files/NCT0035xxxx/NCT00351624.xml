  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether a 4-month period of&#xD;
      supplementation with 400 mg/day of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) provided from chewable softgel&#xD;
      capsules containing bubblegum flavored microalgal oil (DHASCO-S) versus placebo improves one&#xD;
      or more cognitive measures of attention, memory, processing speed, and error rate in healthy&#xD;
      children 4 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to measure the safety and tolerability of the DHA dose&#xD;
      administered and to measure blood DHA levels before and after supplementation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DHA is the primary omega-3 fatty acid present in the brain and retina and plays crucial&#xD;
      structural and functional roles in these issues. The primary dietary source of DHA is fatty&#xD;
      fish (e.g., salmon, herring, tuna). The American diet provides one of the lowest levels of&#xD;
      omega-3 fatty acids of most industrialized nations. Children between the ages of 1 and 5&#xD;
      years consume only 30 to 50 mg DHA per day despite high requirements for this nutrient to&#xD;
      support growth and tissue turnover.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies with human infants have reported visual and cognitive benefits of DHA supplementation&#xD;
      in early life. Reported benefits include significant improvements on tests of visual acuity&#xD;
      during infancy, psychomotor or mental development in the first two years of life, and&#xD;
      problem-solving and sustained attention around 5 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies have evaluated the effect that DHA supplementation has on the cognitive function&#xD;
      of older children. Studies that considered DHA supplementation in children 4-12 years of age&#xD;
      with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or other developmental disorders have&#xD;
      shown improvements on several measures of attention, behavior, and executive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the estimated high requirements of DHA to support growth and maintenance of the brain,&#xD;
      the low consumption of DHA by American children, and the evidence from human and animal&#xD;
      studies that DHA status affects the functional capacity of the central nervous system, there&#xD;
      is a reasonable expectation that DHA supplementation administered to preschool-aged children&#xD;
      will improve performance on tests of attention, memory, processing speed, and error rate.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female, age at enrollment between 4 years 0 months and 4 years 8 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Height and weight between the 10th and 90th percentiles of the National Center for&#xD;
             Health Statistics (NCHS) growth charts&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must meet normal developmental milestones.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject able to understand instructions provided during the cognitive testing, i.e.&#xD;
             English must be the primary language in the home&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No evidence of a medical condition that would preclude successful response or outcome&#xD;
             (e.g., uncorrected vision or hearing impairment, attention deficit disorder, or inborn&#xD;
             error of metabolism)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not taking any medications for seizure disorder, anxiety disorders (e.g., Valium or&#xD;
             related compounds), ADHD (e.g., Ritalin, Adderall, Concerta, Strattera, or similar&#xD;
             medication), childhood psychosis (e.g., Haldol, Risperdal), depression (e.g., Prozac),&#xD;
             or for bipolar disorder. A subject will not be withdrawn from the trial if he/she&#xD;
             needs to take one of these medications after enrollment. Antihistamines (e.g.,&#xD;
             Benadryl or other antihistamines) should not be administered within 24 hours of the&#xD;
             day of the cognitive exams (Claritin or Allegra are allowed). If a subject is taking&#xD;
             an antihistamine on the day of the cognitive tests, the tests will be rescheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Premature birth (&lt; 36 weeks gestation)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject having any medical condition that in the opinion of the principal investigator&#xD;
             would preclude a successful response or outcome (e.g., uncorrected vision or hearing&#xD;
             impairment, attention deficit disorder or inborn error of metabolism)&#xD;
