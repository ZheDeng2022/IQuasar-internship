      The purpose of this study is to obtain and assay human aqueous samples following&#xD;
      pre-operative dosing with 0.1% Brimonidine Purite™ (pH 7.8) or with 0.15% Brimonidine Purite®&#xD;
      (pH 7.2) from patients undergoing routine cataract surgery in order to evaluate the aqueous&#xD;
      concentration of the two formulations.Study hypothesis: The aqueous humor concentration 45&#xD;
      minutes following dosing of 0.1% Brimonidine Purite™ (pH 7.8) is comparable with 0.15%&#xD;
      Brimonidine Purite® (pH 7.2)&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects must:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Be willing and able to provide written Informed Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Be able and willing to follow instructions and likely to complete the entire&#xD;
                  course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Be male or female of any race at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Have visually significant cataract for which they have elected to undergo&#xD;
                  cataract surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No subject may:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Known allergy or sensitivity to the study medication or its components&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Contraindications to brimonidine therapy: concurrent use of monoamine oxidase&#xD;
                  (MAO) inhibitor therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Have any active ocular disease other than glaucoma or ocular hypertension that&#xD;
                  would interfere with study parameters (such as: uveitis, ocular infection, or&#xD;
                  severe dry eye). Patients with mild chronic blepharitis, age-related macular&#xD;
                  degeneration, background diabetic retinopathy may be enrolled at the discretion&#xD;
                  of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Any ocular surgery (including laser, refractive, intraocular filtering surgery,&#xD;
                  or any other ocular surgery) within 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Require use of ocular medications (including glaucoma medications), except&#xD;
                  intermittent use of artificial tears.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Have corneal abnormalities that would interfere with the ability to obtain an&#xD;
                  adequate sample safely or have a shallow anterior chamber which would make&#xD;
                  obtaining an aqueous sample difficult at the time of surgery in the opinion of&#xD;
                  the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Be concurrently enrolled in an investigational drug or device study or&#xD;
                  participation within the last 30 days in any investigational drug or device&#xD;
                  study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Be pregnant, nursing, planning a pregnancy, or be of childbearing potential and&#xD;
                  not using a reliable form of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               9. Have a situation or condition that in the investigator's opinion may put the&#xD;
                  subject at significant risk, may confound the study results, or may interfere&#xD;
                  significantly with participation in the study such as, significant cardiovascular&#xD;
                  disease, hepatic or renal impairment, depression, Raynaud's, orthostatic&#xD;
                  hypotension; uncontrolled high blood pressure. or concomitant use of other&#xD;
                  potential CNS depressants and tricyclics, (Amendment 1, May 25, 2005)&#xD;
