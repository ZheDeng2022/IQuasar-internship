      Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are isolated from the early human embryo and have the&#xD;
      capability to proliferate indefinitely in culture and to develop into nearly every cell of&#xD;
      the human body. Therefore, hESCs may serve as a renewable unlimited source of cells for&#xD;
      transplantation therapy. Because of the use of animal products in their derivation, and due&#xD;
      to the lack of appropriate quality and process controls in the manufacturing of existing cell&#xD;
      lines worldwide, existing hESC lines are not suitable for utilization in transplantation&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our objective is to derive several new hESC lines that will be suitable for clinical trials.&#xD;
      The investigators plan on deriving the new hESC lines utilizing only FDA-approved raw&#xD;
      materials in a non-animal culture system. They will be produced entirely under GMP&#xD;
      conditions, using appropriately documented procedures and analytical methods, completely&#xD;
      safety tested, and screened for infectious and adventitious agents.&#xD;

      Embryonic stem (ES) cell lines are derived from the pluripotent cells of the early embryo.&#xD;
      The key properties of ES cells are their ability to proliferate indefinitely in vitro without&#xD;
      differentiation, and their capability to give rise to all cells of the body. The recent&#xD;
      derivation of ES cell lines from human embryos (Thomson et al., 1998, Reubinoff et al., 2000)&#xD;
      attracts significant attention due to the remarkable potential of these cells for basic&#xD;
      scientific research, drug development, and regenerative medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are capable of unlimited self-renewal and can give&#xD;
      rise to any specialized cell via differentiation, they can potentially be used as an&#xD;
      unlimited donor source of cells for transplantation in a variety of disorders that result&#xD;
      from the loss of cells or cellular dysfunction. Among these conditions is Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease, multiple sclerosis, traumatic spinal cord injury, diabetes, heart failure, liver&#xD;
      failure, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been proposed that the essential characteristics of primate ES cells should include&#xD;
      (i) derivation from the preimplantation or periimplantation embryo, (ii) prolonged&#xD;
      undifferentiated proliferation, and (iii) stable developmental potential to form derivatives&#xD;
      of all three embryonic germ layers even after prolonged culture (Thomson, 1996). The&#xD;
      investigators have derived stem cell lines from early human embryos that meet these criteria&#xD;
      (Reubinoff et al., 2000). Our group was second in the world to derive hESC lines, and the&#xD;
      first to show their potential to undergo somatic differentiation in vitro (Reubinoff et al.,&#xD;
      2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To exploit the remarkable potential of hESCs, improvement of currently used methods for&#xD;
      culturing and manipulating the cells as well as controlling their differentiation are&#xD;
      required. In this context, the investigators have developed novel approaches to cryopreserve&#xD;
      (Reubinoff et al., 2001), to genetically modify (Gropp et al., 2003; Ben-Dor et al., 2006)&#xD;
      and to control the differentiation of hESCs cells (Reubinoff et al., 2001, Itsykson et al.,&#xD;
      2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human ES cell lines are derived from embryos produced by in vitro fertilization (IVF) for&#xD;
      clinical purposes. Surplus frozen embryos that are no longer required for infertility&#xD;
      treatment are recruited for this purpose after donor informed consent and&#xD;
      institutional/national review board approvals are obtained. The embryos are thawed and&#xD;
      cultured to the blastocyst stage (5-6 days), the inner cell mass (ICM) comprised of&#xD;
      pluripotent cells is isolated, and the stem cells are most commonly cultured on mouse&#xD;
      embryonic fibroblast feeder cell layer. The feeder layer is required to prevent&#xD;
      differentiation and to promote the proliferation of the stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most hESC lines reported worldwide to date and all the cell lines currently listed in the NIH&#xD;
      registry were derived on mouse fibroblast feeder layers. The current lines would not be&#xD;
      suitable for clinical use, as the screening of donors and reagents was not FDA compliant, and&#xD;
      the presence of the mouse feeders renders these lines xenotransplantation products. The&#xD;
      regulatory compliance issues these lines raise make it difficult to obtain FDA approval for&#xD;
      human transplantation use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To eliminate the use of mouse feeders, undifferentiated hESCs can be successfully propagated&#xD;
      on laminin or Matrigel-coated plastic surfaces in the presence of mouse embryonic&#xD;
      fibroblast-conditioned medium (Xu et al 2001). While this system avoids direct contact&#xD;
      between mouse feeders and hESCs, the risk of cross-transfer of animal pathogens from the&#xD;
      animal-conditioned medium to the hESCs is not avoided. During the early days of developing&#xD;
      our cell lines, the investigators successfully cultivated the hESCs on human feeders.&#xD;
      Subsequently, Richards and his colleges demonstrated that human fetal and adult feeders&#xD;
      support prolonged undifferentiated propagation of existing hESC lines and are superior to&#xD;
      cell-free matrices supplemented with human or mouse feeder-conditioned medium. They also&#xD;
      reported the derivation of a new hESC line using human embryonic fibroblasts and animal-free&#xD;
      culture conditions (Richards et al., 2002). The potential use of human placenta and&#xD;
      foreskin-derived feeders to develop and support undifferentiated propagation of hESCs was&#xD;
      also demonstrated (Genbacev et al., 2005; Amit et al., 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance of cultures of undifferentiated hESCs in the absence of feeders was recently&#xD;
      reported. It was shown that the combination of LIF, basic fibroblast growth factor, and&#xD;
      transforming growth factor Beta1 can support undifferentiated proliferation of hESCs on&#xD;
      fibronectin (Amit et al., 2004). The activation of the Wnt signaling system was also&#xD;
      suggested to promote the maintenance of pluripotent hESCs in the absence of feeders (Sato et&#xD;
      al., 2004). Furthermore, it has been suggested that substituting the medium with high&#xD;
      concentrations of FGF2 and noggin is sufficient to support the propagation of hESCs without&#xD;
      feeders (Xu et al., 2005). In addition, feeder-free undifferentiated propagation of hESCs&#xD;
      colonies was reported with a chemically-defined medium without serum replacer, supplemented&#xD;
      with activin or nodal plus FGF2 (Vallier er al., 2005). Lastly derivation and propagation of&#xD;
      hESCs in an animal free, chemically-defined, feeder-free culture system in the presence of&#xD;
      high concentrations of FGF2 was reported (Ludwig et al., 2006). So far, the development of&#xD;
      hESC under conditions that will allow there future use for transplantation therapy was not&#xD;
      reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second half of the project, the investigators propose to continue our efforts to&#xD;
      develop new clinical-grade hESC lines derived totally from FDA-approved raw materials in a&#xD;
      non-animal culture system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mouse feeders will be replaced with primary cell lines of human fibroblasts. In the first&#xD;
      part of the project, the investigators have completed the development of master cell banks&#xD;
      (MCBs) of clinical-grade human fibroblast feeders. These feeders were produced entirely under&#xD;
      GMP conditions within the Hadassah Vector Production Facility, using animal-free,&#xD;
      FDA-approved raw materials (for details see Results section). To the best of our knowledge,&#xD;
      the development of GMP clinical-grade human feeders was not reported by other groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In parallel, the investigators have modified the methods for the derivation and culture of&#xD;
      hESCs. The investigators have developed novel animal-free methods for the isolation of the&#xD;
      pluripotent stem cells from human IVF embryos and successfully used these methods in the&#xD;
      derivation of new hESC lines. The replacement of animal products and FDA non-approved&#xD;
      materials with humanized or recombinant clinical-grade materials in the hESC culture system&#xD;
      is near completion. Validation of the efficacy of the modified culture system is ongoing.&#xD;
      Preliminary results suggest that the modified culture system can efficiently support&#xD;
      undifferentiated cultivation of hESCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The newly-derived clinical-grade hESC lines will be derived using embryos from couples&#xD;
      entirely screened according to organ donation and blood donation guidelines and regulations&#xD;
      (per the FDA proposed rule for donor suitability). In the first year, the investigators have&#xD;
      completed the recruitment of 14 embryos from three couples. Donor medical histories were&#xD;
      reviewed, and screening blood and swab test results were obtained and documented. Samples of&#xD;
      donor couple blood were archived for retrospective testing in a locked storage facility.&#xD;
      Recruitment of additional embryos is ongoing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the characterization and safety testing of the new human feeders,&#xD;
      expanding them into working lots, and validation of the efficacy of the clinical&#xD;
      grade-culture system for hESCs, the investigators will develop the new hESC lines in the&#xD;
      Hadassah University Hospital Vector Production Facility, whereby stringent quality control&#xD;
      and environmental testing will be maintained. All work will be accomplished utilizing only&#xD;
      raw materials approved by our Quality Assurance Program, provided by vendors who underwent a&#xD;
      strict vendor approval/review process. The production work will be performed using techniques&#xD;
      adhering to good manufacturing practices (GMPs) and good tissue practices (GTPs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early passage hESCs and feeders (Master Cell Bank) will be submitted for phenotypic and&#xD;
      latent agent testing, endotoxin analysis, and testing for viral and adventitious agent&#xD;
      contamination. The Working Cell Bank of both feeders and hESCs will be also tested for&#xD;
      phenotypic characterization, reproducibility, sterility, and mycoplasma, detection of latent&#xD;
      agents, and endotoxins. The final product will be retested as per the Master Cell Bank,&#xD;
      above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By the conclusion of our manufacturing and testing process, Hadassah's Stem Cell Program will&#xD;
      provide a generic commercial product. The procedures and methods that the investigators have&#xD;
      developed will be instrumental tools to other stem cell researchers, thus paving the way for&#xD;
      the future of stem cell research in Israel and worldwide. The commercial potential of the&#xD;
      product will allow production of specific cells for clinical use; they will have a widespread&#xD;
      commercial value and will be of enormous market worth.&#xD;
