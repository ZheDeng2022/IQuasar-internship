      Hypothesis: The first attempt success rate for peripheral IV insertion for children with&#xD;
      difficult IV access (difficult IV access [DIVA] score ≥ 4) by nurses using the VeinViewer&#xD;
      guided technique is better than conventional method of IV placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate if use of the VeinViewer can improve the success of peripheral IV&#xD;
           placement in children with difficult IV access&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To validate the DIVA score&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Prospective randomized controlled trial/Convenience sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Children (0-18) presenting to the emergency department who require an IV as&#xD;
      determined by examining physician and with a DIVA score ≥ 3 during times when VeinViewer&#xD;
      machine is available and a VeinViewer trained participating nurse is on duty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Variables: First IV attempt success rate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predictor Variables: IV technique used, other potential modifiers (age, weight, height, skin&#xD;
      shade, indication for IV, history of prematurity and, vein visibility/palpability after&#xD;
      tourniquet)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Subjects who meet inclusion criteria will be randomized to either conventional IV&#xD;
      technique or VeinViewer guided technique. The nurse will attempt the IV depending on the&#xD;
      randomization. Success or failure on first IV attempt will be recorded. If unsuccessful,&#xD;
      other attempts will be tried until a successful IV is placed or the physician decides to give&#xD;
      an alternative therapy that does not need IV access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics: A chi square test will be used to compare the proportion of subjects with&#xD;
      successful first attempt IV placement using the VeinViewer technique to that using the&#xD;
      conventional method with 95% confidence interval. We, the researchers, will look at the&#xD;
      median number of attempts to place an IV in each of the groups. Logistic regression will be&#xD;
      performed to test for independent associations. Information collected during the study will&#xD;
      also be used for validation of the DIVA score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks: No extra risks are expected above that of receiving a standard IV. The standard risk&#xD;
      of bleeding, bruising, pain, and infection will be possible regardless of technique used. The&#xD;
      VeinViewer does not expose the patient the ionizing radiation. The use of the VeinViewer&#xD;
      technique may increase the time need to place an IV in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Benefits: With this study, we, the researchers, hope to improve the success rate of&#xD;
      children with difficult IV placement in the Emergency Department.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attempting to get peripheral intravenous (IV) access can be one of the most frustrating and&#xD;
      irksome tasks medical professionals encounter. Many medical therapies require the placement&#xD;
      of an IV. In an emergency situation, it can be the lifeline that makes the difference between&#xD;
      a good or bad outcome. Determinants of successful IV placement include the skill and&#xD;
      expertise of the person who places the IV, the veins of the person who receives the IV, and&#xD;
      luck.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These difficulties are often magnified in children. Children have smaller veins. Children&#xD;
      come in different sizes and shapes. Children are often uncooperative. Not uncommonly,&#xD;
      multiple attempts at IV placement are required before success. The more attempts that are&#xD;
      needed to get an IV placed, the more pain and anxiety a child experiences. Getting an IV in a&#xD;
      timely manner can alter parental perceptions of the quality of care and improve parental&#xD;
      satisfaction. Developing methods to improve success rate of IV placement has obvious&#xD;
      benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a previous study, we were able to demonstrate that in 25% of the patients in our&#xD;
      pediatric emergency department who have an IV placement attempt will fail the first IV&#xD;
      attempt. We were able to develop a scoring system (termed DIVA score) that we believe will&#xD;
      aid in identifying those more likely to have a failed first IV attempt and so therefore may&#xD;
      more likely benefit from our intervention (VeinViewer™). By attempting to demonstrate&#xD;
      improved success on those with an increase likelihood of failure on first IV attempt, we&#xD;
      believe that we will decrease the number of subjects needed to show an effect and to limit&#xD;
      this potentially resource intensive technique to those most likely to benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VeinViewer™ is an infrared imaging system that utilizes near-infrared light and other&#xD;
      technologies to project a real-time image of the location and orientation (up to 0.06mm) of&#xD;
      veins onto the surface of patient's skin. The VeinViewer™ received FDA clearance in August&#xD;
      2004 as a class I device. The VeinViewer's Infrared Light is considered harmless. We believe&#xD;
      a potential application for the VeinViewer™ is to improve the success rate of IV insertion in&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate if use of the VeinViewer™ can improve the success of peripheral IV&#xD;
           placement in children with difficult IV access (DIVA score ≥ 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To validate the DIVA (difficult IV access) score&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The first stick success rate for peripheral IV insertion for children with difficult IV&#xD;
           access in a pediatric emergency department (DIVA score ≥ 3) by registered nurses using&#xD;
           VeinViewer™ guided technique is better than conventional method of IV placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The DIVA score is a valid scoring system to identify those who are more likely to have&#xD;
           failed first IV attempt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Prospective randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Subjects will be randomized to either get the VeinViewer™ technique or the&#xD;
      conventional method. Serially number sealed opaque study packets with the blocked&#xD;
      randomization will be created.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presentation to the ED at the CHW&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  0 to 19 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Requires a peripheral IV as determined by the examining physician&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DIVA score ≥ 3 (a clinical scoring system that identifying difficult IV access that&#xD;
           gives 2 points for vein not visible after tourniquet, 2 for vein not palpable after&#xD;
           tourniquet, 1 for age 1-2yo, 3 for age &lt; 1 yo, 3 for history of prematurity)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During times when VeinViewer™ machine and participating nurse is available&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Central line available&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immunocompromised patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Requirement for immediate IV placement (Patient's condition would potentially be&#xD;
           compromised if there is a time delay in IV placement.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who present to the emergency department and whom an IV is ordered will be screened&#xD;
      for inclusion in the study by research assistants, nursing, or investigators. A DIVA score&#xD;
      will be determined. Those with a score ≥ 3 will be approached to take part in the study.&#xD;
      Informed parental consent will be obtained. Patient assent will be obtained for children 7&#xD;
      years of age and older).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predictor Variables: VeinViewer™ or conventional methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Outcome Variable: Success or failure of peripheral IV placement on first attempt&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Variable: Number of attempts to successful IV placement&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to be collected (potential modifiers for successful IV placement):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age (Date of Birth)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of IV attempts until success or quitting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Date of visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Location of IV attempts&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reason for IV (Fluid, medication, other)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Height&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dermablend skin color category&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of prematurity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-attempt analgesia used&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vein visibility after tourniquet&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vein palpability after tourniquet&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Technique used (VeinViewer™/Conventional technique)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A tourniquet is applied. The nurse identifies a target vein visually and tactilely in one of&#xD;
      several areas of possible IV sites (dorsum of the hand, antecubital fossa, or forearm). The&#xD;
      area is cleaned with an alcohol pad. The nurse then inserts an 18-24 gauge IV needle/catheter&#xD;
      and looks for a flashback. The tourniquet is released. The IV is then flushed. If the IV&#xD;
      flushes well, then the IV is secured in the usual manner. A secured flushed IV is the&#xD;
      definition of a successful IV placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VeinViewer™ technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A tourniquet is applied. Using the VeinViewer™ the nurse identifies a vein for cannulation. A&#xD;
      tourniquet is applied. The nurse then attempts to insert an 18-24 gauge IV needle/catheter&#xD;
      and looks for a flashback. The tourniquet is released. The IV is then flushed. If the IV&#xD;
      flushes well, then the IV is secured in the usual manner. A secured flushed IV is the&#xD;
      definition of a successful IV placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent Attempts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If unsuccessful with first attempt at IV placement, an attempt at another site with the same&#xD;
      technique (VeinViewer™ guided or conventional method) will be performed. This will be&#xD;
      repeated until a successful IV is placed or the physician decides to give an alternative&#xD;
      therapy that does not need IV access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to monitor the success rate for DIVA patients who are not enrolled in the study to&#xD;
      demonstrate that they are comparable to our control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      VeinViewer™ vs Conventional method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome is success or failure of peripheral IV placement on first attempt (a&#xD;
      dichotomous outcome). A Chi square test will be used to compare the proportion of subjects&#xD;
      with successful first stick IV placement using the VeinViewer™ technique to that using the&#xD;
      conventional method with 95% confidence intervals around the difference. Also, planned is to&#xD;
      look at the median number of attempts to place IV with each of the different methods of IV&#xD;
      placement. We plan to use a non-parametric test like the Wilcoxon Rank sum test. To test for&#xD;
      independent associations between VeinViewer™ technique or conventional method for IV&#xD;
      placement and success or failure of IV placement on first attempt, multivariate logistic&#xD;
      regression will be performed, with potential confounding variables (patient weight,&#xD;
      diagnosis, etc) included as co-variates in the model. We plan to use an interaction term in&#xD;
      the model that will take in account that there may be a learning curve for the technique&#xD;
      (nurses early in the study vs. nurses later in the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DIVA score validation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients whose information we collected (validation cohort) in this study will be used to&#xD;
      validate the DIVA score. We will determine first attempt success rate with conventional IV&#xD;
      placement method at each DIVA score in both the derivation cohort (from data previously&#xD;
      collected in the derivation study) and the validation cohort. We will use chi-square&#xD;
      statistics to compare derivation and validation cohorts. The areas under the receiver&#xD;
      operating characteristics curves for predicting successful IV placement on first attempt at&#xD;
      each DIVA score will be compared between the derivation and validation cohorts. Attempts will&#xD;
      be made to refine the score should analysis demonstrates that it is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated sample size calculation: From a previous study, we demonstrated that patients with&#xD;
      a DIVA score ≥ 3 had a more than 45% first attempt failure rate for peripheral IV placement&#xD;
      using the conventional method. A technique that can improve success by 25% would be&#xD;
      considered significant. Using alpha of 0.05, beta of 0.10 (Power = 0.90), and making the&#xD;
      question two-tailed; we find an estimated sample size in each group of 85. In other words,&#xD;
      170 children with DIVA ≥ 3 will be needed for our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk to Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no extra risks expected above that of receiving a standard IV. The standard risks&#xD;
      of IV include bleeding, bruising, pain, and infection. The use of the VeinViewer™ technique&#xD;
      may or may not take more time to place an IV. If a delay would be detrimental to the&#xD;
      subject's care, they will not be asked to take part in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated significance of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A technique that improves the first stick success rate or decreases the number of sticks&#xD;
      required to place an IV would decrease amount of pain, discomfort, and anxiety for the&#xD;
      patient. Getting an IV in a timely manner can alter parental perceptions of the quality of&#xD;
      care and improve parental satisfaction. Also, this may be a time saver for nurses.&#xD;
