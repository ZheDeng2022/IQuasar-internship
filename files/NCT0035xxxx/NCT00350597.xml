      This is a pilot study to describe the immunological responses and clinical outcome associated&#xD;
      with administration of recombinant human Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor&#xD;
      (GM-CSF) as surgical adjuvant therapy in patients with malignant melanoma who are at high&#xD;
      risk for recurrence (Stage II T4, III and IV). The immunological responses include serum&#xD;
      neopterin levels. In a sub-set of study participants, additional immunologic testing will be&#xD;
      done, including monocyte cytotoxicity to a melanoma cell line and phenotypic and functional&#xD;
      markers of dendritic and T cell activation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The&#xD;
      clinical end points of the study include safety, time to disease recurrence, time to&#xD;
      disseminated disease, and survival. Eligible patients are those with high-risk melanoma who&#xD;
      are clinically tumor free following surgery. Treatment will consist of GM-CSF at 125 g/m2&#xD;
      once daily (maximum dose 250 g) for 14 days followed by 14 days of rest (28 day cycle) for 1&#xD;
      year. Clinical status will be monitored until death or until the patient has been tumor free&#xD;
      for five years, whichever event occurs first. Immunologic responses will be determined&#xD;
      pretreatment, at the end of the first 14 days of dosing (Day 15), after the 14-day rest&#xD;
      period (Day 29) and at the end of 14 days of dosing in cycles 6 (Day 155) and 13 (Day 351).&#xD;
      Clinical outcome will be determined according to patient risk group (ultra-high risk Stage&#xD;
      IIIC or IV versus high-risk Stage II T4, Stage IIIA and Stage IIIB). The pilot study will&#xD;
      also assess the association of the immunological responses with clinical response and safety&#xD;
      by patient risk group.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible patients will be males or females with histologically proven melanoma.&#xD;
             Patients must have Stage II (T4), III, and IV malignant melanoma surgically resected&#xD;
             with no clinical evidence of disease by clinical, laboratory criteria or radiologic&#xD;
             examination as defined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals must be at least 14 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are not eligible. Men and women will be required to use an effective&#xD;
             form of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients requiring corticosteroid therapy or are receiving other forms of&#xD;
             immunotherapy are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have received immunotherapy for prior disease. They must have completed&#xD;
             therapy at least one month prior to study entry. Patients may not have received prior&#xD;
             chemotherapy or therapy with GM-CSF. Patients are permitted to receive adjuvant&#xD;
             radiation therapy but these patients will not be selected as part of the sub-set&#xD;
             undergoing studies of cellular immunologic responses since the radiation could alter&#xD;
             these responses. Based on the reults from one randomized, controlled clinical trial,&#xD;
             the LEUKINE product labeling contains the following contraindication: &quot;Due to the&#xD;
             potential sensitivity of rapidly dividing hematopoietic progenitor cells, LEUKINE&#xD;
             should not be administered simultaneously with cytoxic chemotherapy or radiotherapy or&#xD;
             within 24 hours preceding or following chemotherapy or radiotherapy. In one controlled&#xD;
             study, patients with small cell lung cancer received LEUKINE and concurrent thoracic&#xD;
             radiotherapy and chemotherapy or the identical radiotherapy and chemotherapy without&#xD;
             LEUKINE. The patients randomized to LEUKINE had significantly higher incidence of&#xD;
             adverse events, including higher mortality and a higher incidence of grade 4&#xD;
             infections and grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia.28&quot; Other investigators have reported&#xD;
             that CM-CSF can be given safely with concurrent radiation therapy. These contrasting&#xD;
             results may be related to differences in the patient populations or intensity and/or&#xD;
             location of the site of radiotherapy in the body, among other factors. GM-CSF has been&#xD;
             administered safely in combination with radiation therapy for treatment of head and&#xD;
             neck cancers29,30 and has been used safely during regimens that combine chemotherapy&#xD;
             and radiation therapy.31&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must undergo examination for evidence of residual disease, including physical&#xD;
             examination, CBC, chemistry panel, CT scan of the chest and abdomen (and pelvis for&#xD;
             lower extremity or lower trunk lesions), and single sequence with gadolinium MRI or CT&#xD;
             of the brain. A PET scan may be substituted for the CT of the chest and abdomen (and&#xD;
             pelvis). These tests must be negative for residual disease before entry into the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Administration of the protocol medication must be initiated within 90 days of the&#xD;
             definitive surgical excision rendering the patient NED.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

          -  Patients not meeting Inclusion Criteria described above&#xD;
