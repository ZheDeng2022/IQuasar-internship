  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the parts of the brain that use visual information to perform&#xD;
      movements. Patients with certain brain lesions tend to have difficulty in processing visually&#xD;
      presented objects. This study will look at the brain mechanisms underlying the visuo-motor&#xD;
      integration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers between 20 and 60 years of age are eligible for this study. People&#xD;
      who have had a severe head injury with loss of consciousness or any other mental or&#xD;
      neurological disorder diagnosed by a doctor may not participate. Candidates will be screened&#xD;
      with a medical history, a physical examination focusing on finger movements, and a&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants' brain activity will be recorded using two techniques -&#xD;
      magnetoencephalography(MEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) - while they watch pictures&#xD;
      of various objects flashed on a screen. MEG is a procedure to record magnetic field changes&#xD;
      produced by brain activity. During the recording, the subject sits comfortably in an armchair&#xD;
      in a dimly lit room and watches pictures presented on a screen. About 50 pictures are shown&#xD;
      per session. There are about five sessions, separated by 3-minute breaks. Functional MRI&#xD;
      involves taking pictures of the brain using MRI while the subject performs a task. MRI uses a&#xD;
      strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of body organs and tissues. The MRI&#xD;
      scanner is a metal cylinder surrounded by a magnetic field. The subject lies still on a table&#xD;
      that can slide in and out of the scanner. During the scan, he or she looks at pictures in six&#xD;
      test blocks of 1 minute each, with 30-second breaks between blocks.&#xD;

      Objectives: Patients with frontal lobe lesions tend to grasp visually presented objects&#xD;
      automatically and forcefully (forced grasping). Grasping of a milder form is seen in infants&#xD;
      and the aged population. These facts suggest the presence of an inherent mechanism for&#xD;
      suppressing the automatic tendency toward grasping in the healthy adult brain. Previous&#xD;
      studies suggest that the parieto-frontal network, especially the lateral premotor cortex,&#xD;
      play a role in the cognition of graspable objects and execution of reaching/grasping.&#xD;
      Although the task of reaching/grasping in human beings has been studied mainly by&#xD;
      neuroimaging techniques, its cognitive and executive aspects have not been clearly&#xD;
      distinguished. Therefore, this project aims to elucidate the mechanisms underlying 'automatic&#xD;
      grasping' in humans, focusing on the perceptive/cognitive aspect of the reaching/grasping&#xD;
      movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population and design: Pictures of graspable objects and non-graspable objects are&#xD;
      visually presented to 45 healthy adult volunteers. Since this study aims to clarify the&#xD;
      mechanism of the human brain for automatically recognizing graspable objects, part of this&#xD;
      study will require no response task. Additionally, in order to assess how the automatic&#xD;
      functions compare to overt mechanisms, an extra testing session will explore making overt&#xD;
      judgments of the pictures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The brain activations are investigated by event-related magnetic fields,&#xD;
      which have high temporal resolution, and by event-related functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (fMRI), which has relatively high spatial resolution. It is expected that the lateral&#xD;
      premotor cortex, in addition to the parietal cortex, is activated by the visual presentation&#xD;
      of graspable objects at a shorter latency, and more strongly, as compared with non-graspable&#xD;
      objects, even without any actual motor tasks to follow. Additionally, overt grasping of&#xD;
      graspable objects will involve similar areas.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy male or female subjects between the ages of 20 and 60 years old will be eligible&#xD;
        within the limits of the exclusion criteria below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A previous history of neurological diseases will be carefully taken by direct interview by&#xD;
        the Principal or Associate Investigators. Subjects who had a head injury (severe enough to&#xD;
        cause loss of consciousness) or other brain diseases causing mental disturbance, sensory&#xD;
        impairment, or motor dysfunction in the past will be excluded. Subjects who have metals&#xD;
        either in the mouth, such as dental prostheses, or in the head, such as surgical clips from&#xD;
        any previous surgical procedures, are also excluded due to technical limitations in terms&#xD;
        of MEG. Furthermore, subjects wearing glasses for visual correction and those with poor&#xD;
        vision, even with contact lenses, are excluded also due to technical limitations for MEG.&#xD;
        Subjects who have pacemakers or other implanted electrical devices, brain stimulators,&#xD;
        dental implants, aneurysm clips (metal clips on the wall of a large artery), metallic&#xD;
        prostheses (including metal pins and rods, heart valves, and cochlear implants), permanent&#xD;
        eyeliner, implanted delivery pump, or shrapnel fragments, and welders and metal workers are&#xD;
        excluded for MRI for the sake of safety of subjects. Finally, by doing a brief neurological&#xD;
        examination of finger movements, the subjects with poor performance of fine finger&#xD;
        movements or those who are judged to have mirror movements will be excluded.&#xD;
