      This study will explore the regulation of fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23). It is a&#xD;
      hormone recently identified as a regulator of the blood levels of phosphorus and vitamin D,&#xD;
      both of which are essential for overall health and especially important for bone health. The&#xD;
      parathyroid hormone (PTH) regulates phosphorus and calcium, but people with&#xD;
      hypoparathyroidism or pseudohypoparathyroidism do not have sufficient PTH action. There are&#xD;
      genetic diseases that influence FGF-23, causing abnormal metabolism of phosphorus and vitamin&#xD;
      D, thus affecting the bones. Also, there are rare tumors that may cause overproduction of&#xD;
      FGF-23 causing debilitating bone disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients ages 18 and older who have low PTH levels, or are resistant to PTH action, and take&#xD;
      calcitriol and calcium supplements, who are not pregnant, and who do not have kidney&#xD;
      disorders may be eligible for this study. During the 4-day study, patients will be provided&#xD;
      with a controlled diet that has a lower than usual phosphorus content. On day 1, patients&#xD;
      will be admitted to the NIH Clinic Center and undergo blood and urine tests to measure&#xD;
      calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, and FGF-23. They will continue with their regular medicine&#xD;
      for hypoparathyroidism. On that day and throughout the study, patients will fast from 10:00&#xD;
      p.m. to 8:00 a.m. the following day. On day 2, patients will continue fasting until 4:00 p.m.&#xD;
      A tube will be placed in the vein of each arm: one for drawing blood and the other for&#xD;
      infusing calcium. Just one intravenous (IV) line will be used on the other days. Patients&#xD;
      will receive calcium chloride for 8 hours, at a dose carefully monitored by a machine. The&#xD;
      purpose is to bring the blood calcium level to the high normal range or just above. Blood and&#xD;
      urine samples will be collected periodically, to check for effects of calcium chloride on&#xD;
      FGF-23 and PTH. On days 3 and 4, patients will not take calcitriol and calcium but will&#xD;
      receive injections of PTH, under the skin, two times each day. On day 3, blood and urine&#xD;
      samples will be again be collected for analysis. On day 4, patients will receive one dose of&#xD;
      calcitriol by IV. The total amount of blood drawn during this study will be about 5 ounces.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Vitamin D and phosphate are central to normal mineral homeostasis and important in many&#xD;
      physiologic functions including skeletal integrity. For several decades parathyroid hormone&#xD;
      (PTH) has been recognized as a central regulator of serum vitamin D and phosphate levels.&#xD;
      Recently, FGF-23 has been identified as central in the regulation of the metabolism of&#xD;
      vitamin D and serum phosphorus. The organ primarily responsible for the physiologic&#xD;
      production of FGF-23 appears to be the skeleton. The study of FGF-23 metabolism and its&#xD;
      direct effect on mineral metabolism is confounded by the classic endocrine feedback loops&#xD;
      that exist among serum calcium, phosphorus, 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D (1,25-D), and PTH. It is&#xD;
      possible that any of these (phosphorus, calcium, 1,25-D, and/or PTH) are important in the&#xD;
      regulation of serum FGF-23. The goal of this study is to identify what factors regulate serum&#xD;
      FGF-23.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome the confounding effect of PTH, we will study patients deficient in PTH&#xD;
      (hypoparathyroidism) or resistant to PTH at the kidney (pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1B,&#xD;
      PHP1B). The kidney is one of the primary organs responsible for regulating serum phosphorus&#xD;
      and generating 1,25-D. It is the target of PTH and FGF-23. While patients with PHP1B are&#xD;
      resistant to the action of PTH at the kidney, they are sensitive to the action of PTH at the&#xD;
      bone, the tissue that produces FGF-23. Physiologic manipulation of the serum phosphorus,&#xD;
      1,25-D, calcium, and PTH in subjects with hypoparathyroidism or PHP1B will allow for a nearly&#xD;
      complete dissection of the factors that are potential regulators of serum FGF-23.&#xD;

        supplementation, and who are willing to participate in the study will be eligible.&#xD;
