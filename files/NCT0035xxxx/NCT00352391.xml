    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to look at how long individuals who have been treated for&#xD;
      early stage NSCLC or HNSCC live without developing lung cancer. Another goal is to develop&#xD;
      tools to help predict the likelihood of lung cancer occurrence in this population. This will&#xD;
      be done by studying characteristics of tissue and bodily fluids (including blood).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the smoking-related disease-free survival in patients who are current or&#xD;
           former smokers with a prior definitively-treated stage I/II lung or head and neck&#xD;
           cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop a risk model to help predict the likelihood of lung cancer development both&#xD;
           imaging and biomarker based in this high-risk population.&#xD;

      This study is known as the Vanguard Trial. When you enter this study, you will have a&#xD;
      complete medical history (including smoking history) and physical exam, including measurement&#xD;
      of height, weight, and vital signs (including blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature).&#xD;
      You will have a performance status evaluation (a test looking at the ability to perform every&#xD;
      day activities). You will have blood samples drawn for routine blood tests (about 3&#xD;
      teaspoons), to check your blood clotting function (about 1-2 teaspoons), and for research&#xD;
      purposes (about 4 teaspoons). You will have a chest x-ray and a CT scan of your chest. Women&#xD;
      who are able to have children must have a negative blood or urine pregnancy test. If you are&#xD;
      currently a smoker, you will be given information on programs to help you quit smoking.&#xD;
      Although you will be encouraged to quit smoking, you do not have to quit smoking or&#xD;
      participate in these programs to be a part of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also have a bronchoscopy (tissue sample from the lung) at the beginning of this&#xD;
      study for lab analysis. For this procedure, you will be given drugs to relax. Then, a local&#xD;
      anesthetic will be sprayed in your nose and throat to numb those areas. A slim, flexible tube&#xD;
      with a light will be placed through your nose or mouth and into your lungs. Tweezers will be&#xD;
      fed through the tube to collect lung tissue (biopsy) samples from 6 different places in your&#xD;
      lungs. During the bronchoscopy procedure, a complete inspection of the airways will be&#xD;
      performed. Any suspicious areas that are seen under the white-light and autofluorescence&#xD;
      bronchoscopy will be identified and more biopsies and brushings will be performed to evaluate&#xD;
      whether any pre-cancerous tissue is present. You will also have a bronchial brushing next to&#xD;
      each biopsy site. In a bronchial brushing, a small brush is fed through the tube into your&#xD;
      lungs and a sample of lung tissue is gently scraped off. When the biopsies and brushings are&#xD;
      done, you will have a bronchial lavage (bronchial washing). In the bronchial lavage, a small&#xD;
      amount of water (about 4 tablespoons) is sprayed into your lungs and then suctioned out&#xD;
      through the tube. This fluid is used to collect additional tissue and mucous samples. In&#xD;
      addition, a sputum (saliva) sample will be taken and the inside of your cheek will be scraped&#xD;
      (buccal sample).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you have had HNSCC, you will also have a laryngoscopy. In a laryngoscopy, a lighted tube&#xD;
      is placed down your throat and the larynx is checked. The back of your throat will be sprayed&#xD;
      with an anesthetic before this procedure to make the procedure more comfortable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While on study, you will return to the clinic for at least 3 years and for up to a total of 6&#xD;
      years. At Months 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36, your complete medical history will be recorded,&#xD;
      and you will have a physical exam by either a doctor or a nurse. At each of these visits, you&#xD;
      will also have blood drawn for routine tests (about 3 teaspoons) and for research purposes&#xD;
      (about 4 teaspoons). You will also have a chest x-ray and a chest CT at these visits. At&#xD;
      Months 12, 24 and 36, you will have blood drawn (about 1-2 teaspoons) to check your&#xD;
      blood-clotting function. If you think you may be pregnant, you will also have a urine or&#xD;
      blood pregnancy test. In addition, you will have a bronchoscopy and provide sputum and buccal&#xD;
      smear samples at your 12 month visit. If you have been treated for HNSCC you will have a&#xD;
      laryngoscopy at 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You have the right to leave the study at any time. If you choose to stop participating in&#xD;
      this study, you will be asked to return to the clinic for a final clinic visit. At this&#xD;
      visit, your complete medical history will be recorded, and you will have a physical exam and&#xD;
      blood drawn for routine tests (about 3 teaspoons) and for research purposes (about 4&#xD;
      teaspoons). Your study doctor will also ask you about your current smoking use, any&#xD;
      medications you are taking, and how you are feeling (symptoms).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study includes two bronchoscopies done one year apart. These bronchoscopies are&#xD;
      being done primarily for research purposes and are unlikely to provide information useful in&#xD;
      your individual treatment. These bronchoscopies do have risks associated with them. These&#xD;
      risks are described in section 4 of this informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent research on early stage NSCLC indicates that adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery&#xD;
      increases the length of time a person may survive and the length of time before cancer&#xD;
      recurs. However, this adjuvant chemotherapy also has side effects that can be severe and in&#xD;
      rare cases fatal. If you have had surgery for NSCLC and wish to receive adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy, you may only enroll in the Vanguard study after you have completed the adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of this study you will provide samples of your lung tissue, saliva, blood, and&#xD;
      scrapings from the inside of your cheek. Fluid and mucous collected during the bronchoscopies&#xD;
      will also collected. These samples will be studied by scientists to learn about genes and&#xD;
      proteins in people who have been treated for early NSCLC or HNSCC. The samples will also be&#xD;
      used to grow cells and cultures that will be used to test chemotherapy drugs. These cells and&#xD;
      cultures will also be used to learn about genes and proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All M. D. Anderson researchers are trained in the importance of maintaining patient privacy.&#xD;
      Your privacy will be protected by assigning you a number that will be used in place of your&#xD;
      name on documents that are part of this study. A list that links your name with your study&#xD;
      number will be stored in a restricted file that may be accessed only with a password. Only a&#xD;
      few essential research personnel have access to this password.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study you will not be automatically notified of the research findings. If&#xD;
      you wish to learn about the results, however, you may request them from the principal&#xD;
      investigator:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal Investigator: Waun Ki Hong, MD 1515 Holcombe Blvd., Unit 432 MD Anderson Cancer&#xD;
      Center Houston, TX 77030&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. A total of about 50 individuals will take part in this&#xD;
      study. Participants will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson and several other sites around the&#xD;
      country.&#xD;
