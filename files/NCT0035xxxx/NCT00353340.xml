      PROTOCOL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevention of Contrast Nephropathy by Sodium Bicarbonate Versus Sodium Chloride and&#xD;
      N-Acetylcysteine&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nephrology and Cardiology Services, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Background and rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
           The development of acute renal failure following cardiac catheterization has been&#xD;
           recognized since the 1970's. The syndrome of acute renal failure following cardiac&#xD;
           catheterization is presently felt to be due either to atheroembolic disease or what is&#xD;
           now referred to as contrast induced nephropathy. Since the clinical course of each is&#xD;
           different, it is now usually not difficult to diagnose acute contrast induced&#xD;
           nephropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All protocols to prevent contrast nephropathy include the infusion of sodium chloride&#xD;
           with or without oral N-acetylcysteine (NAC) pretreatment, although several recent&#xD;
           meta-analyses raise some doubt about the efficacy of.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Review of Shaare Zedek Medical Center experience from 2000 thru 2003 demonstrated a&#xD;
           significant decrease in the incidence of acute contrast induced nephropathy after&#xD;
           cardiac catheterization following the introduction of routine NAC usage. This effect was&#xD;
           detected in a patients with mild renal insufficiency only (creatinine less than&#xD;
           1.5mg/dl). Patients with higher plasma creatinines did not appear to benefit from NAC&#xD;
           prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A recent study demonstrated that preventive hydration with sodium bicarbonate was more&#xD;
           effective than sodium chloride in patients undergoing radiographic procedures. However,&#xD;
           in that study, there was no subdivision of the patients by severity of their kidney&#xD;
           disease and it is not clear if sodium bicarbonate was as effective in patients with more&#xD;
           severe kidney disease as in those with milder renal impairment. In addition the rate,&#xD;
           duration and kind of fluids that were used for preventive hydration differed from that&#xD;
           currently recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Because free radicals are postulated to mediate contrast induced nephropathy and their&#xD;
           formation is promoted by an acidic environment, alkalinizing renal tubular fluid with&#xD;
           bicarbonate may reduce renal injury by reducing free radial formation. NAC is also known&#xD;
           to be a free radical scavenger but since this compound was relatively ineffective in&#xD;
           preventing contrast nephropathy in our patients with moderate to severe renal impairment&#xD;
           (plasma creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg%), we postulate that sodium bicarbonate may be more&#xD;
           effective in the prevention of contrast nephropathy in these high risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The proposed study is designed to test the efficacy of preventive hydration with sodium&#xD;
           bicarbonate versus sodium chloride and oral NAC pretreatment in patients with stable&#xD;
           advanced renal insufficiency (CKD stage 3 and 4-GFR 15-60ml/min/1.73m2 calculated by&#xD;
           MDRD formula) undergoing cardiac catheterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
           The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of sodium bicarbonate compared&#xD;
           with sodium chloride and NACpretreatment for prevention of contrast nephropathy in&#xD;
           patients with advanced renal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Outcome measure&#xD;
&#xD;
           The incidence of contrast induced nephropathy, defined as 25% or more increase in serum&#xD;
           creatinine within 2 days of contrast administration, will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is a prospective, randomized, single center trial. Patients due to undergo cardiac&#xD;
           catheterization either electively or following acute coronary syndromes will be eligible&#xD;
           for inclusion. Elective patients will be admitted the day before the procedure. After&#xD;
           baseline assessment and laboratory tests, they will be randomly assigned to one of two&#xD;
           groups. One group will receive 12 hours infusion of 154 meq/l (0.9%) sodium chloride at&#xD;
           a rate of 1ml/kg per hour before cardiac catheterization and NAC 600mg x 2/d PO the day&#xD;
           before and the day of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The second group will receive 154meq/l sodium bicarbonate in 5% dextrose in water mixed&#xD;
           by the nursing staff by adding 154 ml of 1000 meq/l sodium bicarbonate to 846 ml of 5%&#xD;
           dextrose in water, slightly diluting the dextrose concentration to 4.23%.The initial IV&#xD;
           bolus will be 3 ml/kg for one hour before cardiac catheterization. Following this bolus,&#xD;
           patients will receive the same fluid at a rate of 1 ml/kg per hour during the contrast&#xD;
           exposure and for 6 hours after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A basic panel of blood chemistries (Na, K, Cl, Ca, P, BUN, creatinine, total protein,&#xD;
           albumin, complete blood count, pH, HCO3, pCO2 and O2 sat) will be obtained before the&#xD;
           procedure and post-procedure day 1 and 2 and until any increase of serum creatinine is&#xD;
           resolved. GFR will be calculated by MDRD formula in all patients before cardiac&#xD;
           catheterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patient selection&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will be identified as study candidates based on preliminary laboratory tests&#xD;
           results. They will referred from the clinics of Shaare Zedek, Kupot Cholim and the&#xD;
           inpatient services of Shaare Zedek Medical Center. Eligible patients include individuals&#xD;
           aged 18 year or older with GFR 15-60ml/min calculated by MDRD formula, who were&#xD;
           scheduled to undergo cardiac catheterization. During the randomized study, consecutive&#xD;
           eligible patients scheduled for exposure to the nonionic radiographic contrast agent&#xD;
           iopamidol (796 mOsm/kg H2O, 755 mg of iopamidol per milliliter, and 370 mg iodine per&#xD;
           milliliter) will be considered for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. Serum creatinine levels more than 8mg/dl or GFR less than 15ml/min&#xD;
&#xD;
           ii. Change in serum creatinine levels of ³0.5mg/dl during the previous 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
           iii. Preexisting dialysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           iv. Multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
           v. Pulmonary edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
           vi. Uncontrolled hypertension (treated systolic blood pressure more than 160 mmHg, or&#xD;
           diastolic blood pressure more than 100mmHg.)&#xD;
&#xD;
           vii. Emergency catheterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
           viii. Recent exposure to radiographic contrast (within two days of the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
           ix. Allergy to radiocontrast.&#xD;
&#xD;
           x. Pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           xi. Administration of dopamine, mannitol or NAC before the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study will be completely blinded. The serum creatinine level will be determined in a&#xD;
           fully blinded fashion by laboratory personnel. The investigators from the Nephrology&#xD;
           service will analyze the laboratory data without knowledge of patient study groups. The&#xD;
           patients will not know to which group they will be randomized. The investigators from&#xD;
           the Cardiology service will know the patient study groups, but will not analyze the&#xD;
           patients laboratory tests results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Study Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
           Qualified patients who agree to enter the study will be assigned to 1 of 2 treatment&#xD;
           groups based on a computer-generated randomization schedule. Patients allocated to the&#xD;
           sodium chloride-NAC group will receive 154mEq/L of sodium chloride at a rate of 1ml/kg&#xD;
           per hour for 12 hours before cardiac catheterization and NAC 600mgx2/d PO the day before&#xD;
           and the day of the procedure. Patients allocated to the sodium bicarbonate group will&#xD;
           receive 154 mEq/L of sodium bicarbonate in dextrose and H2O, mixed by the Nursing&#xD;
           Service by adding 154 mL of 1000 mEq/L sodium bicarbonate to 846 mL of 5% dextrose in&#xD;
           H2O, slightly diluting the dextrose concentration to 4.23%.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After appropriate nursing evaluation and initial measurement of blood pressure and&#xD;
           weight, the pre-contrast fluid will be administered. Patients allocated to the sodium&#xD;
           chloride-NACgroup will receive 154 mEq/L of sodium chloride at a rate of 1ml/kg per hour&#xD;
           for 12 hours before cardiac catheterization and NAC 600mgx2/d PO the day before and the&#xD;
           day of the procedure The initial intravenous bolus in the NaHCO3 group will be 3 mL/kg&#xD;
           per hour for 1 hour immediately before radiocontrast injection. Following this, patients&#xD;
           will receive the same fluid at a rate of 1 mL/kg per hour during the contrast exposure&#xD;
           and for 6 hours after the procedure. For patients weighing more than 110 kg, the initial&#xD;
           fluid bolus and drip will be limited to those doses administered to a patient weighing&#xD;
           110 kg. Diuretics will be routinely withheld on the day of contrast injection. A basic&#xD;
           panel of blood chemistries (Na, K, Cl, Ca, P, BUN, creatinine, total protein, albumin,&#xD;
           complete blood count, serum pH, HCO3, pCO2 and O2 sat)) will be obtained before the&#xD;
           procedure and post-procedure days 1 and 2 and until any increase of serum creatinine is&#xD;
           resolved. GFR will be calculated by MDRD formula before the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Study End Points and Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary outcome measure is development of contrast-induced nephropathy, defined by&#xD;
           an increase in serum creatinine of 25% or more within 2 days after cardiac&#xD;
           catheterization. This definition is identical to that used in a recent large&#xD;
           meta-analysis in contrast-induced nephropathy. Post-contrast creatinine will be assessed&#xD;
           the mornings of days 1 and 2. The highest serum creatinine on post-contrast days 1 or 2&#xD;
           will be used to calculate the change in serum creatinine (the primary end point).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Before beginning the study, we estimated the sample size needed for the primary end&#xD;
           point of contrast-induced nephropathy. Based on our own and other previous data, we&#xD;
           assumed the development of contrast-induced renal failure in 15% of the sodium&#xD;
           chloride-NAC group and 5 % of the sodium bicarbonate group. Analysis indicated that a&#xD;
           sample size of 281 patients would be required to detect a statistically significant&#xD;
           difference with a power of 80% (two tailed p = 0.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Tests for significance will be conducted using the t test for continuous variables and&#xD;
           c2 or Fisher exact test for categorical variables. All analyses will be conducted using&#xD;
           SAS software version 8.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). Data will be expressed as mean&#xD;
           (SD). All tests will be 2-tailed, with differences reported as significant if p &lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Feasibility of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
           The average number of cardiac catheterizations performed in Shaare Zedek Medical Center&#xD;
           is 25-30 procedures per week. A recent review of 30 consecutive cardiac catheterization&#xD;
           patients showed that 8 would be eligible for enrollment in this protocol. Thus, it&#xD;
           should take about 10-12 months to enroll the required number of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Safety&#xD;
&#xD;
           The infusion of sodium bicarbonate and sodium chloride is safe. In the published sodium&#xD;
           bicarbonate study bolus administration of hydration fluids caused a moderate increase in&#xD;
           both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mean 11mm Hg in the sodium chloride group&#xD;
           and 14 mmHg in the sodium bicarbonate group.) No patients developed clinical heart&#xD;
           failure or respiratory distress. Since the patients enrolled in our study should have&#xD;
           controlled hypertension (patients with blood pressure more than 160/100 will be&#xD;
           excluded) this mild elevation in blood pressure should not be problematic.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Study significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contrast induced nephropathy is a common complication of cardiac catheterizations.&#xD;
      Prophylactic hydration with sodium chloride and NAC which is currently in use is less&#xD;
      effective in patients with advanced renal disease and the observed incidence of acute&#xD;
      contrast induced nephropathy is approximately 15%. In addition the use of this regimen&#xD;
      requires preventive hospitalization and may be especially problematic in patients with&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease when they require urgent cardiac catheterization. If preventive&#xD;
      hydration with sodium bicarbonate is as effective or better than the currently used&#xD;
      saline-NAC regimen, the pretreatment time for cardiac catheterization could be significantly&#xD;
      shortened, hence permitting its usage before emergent procedure. Since emergent procedures&#xD;
      preclude the use of current relatively long pretreatment regimens, bicarbonate could reduce&#xD;
      the incidence of acute contrast induced nephropathy in this highly vulnerable group.&#xD;
