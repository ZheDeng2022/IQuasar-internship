      We are investigating whether, after surgical cure of primary hyperparathyroidism, alendronate&#xD;
      provides even greater beneficial skeletal effects than parathyroidectomy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a disorder that can be associated with bone loss. After&#xD;
      successful surgery for PHPT bone density improves without any treatment. However, it is&#xD;
      possible that bone density might improve to an even greater extent if Fosamax is used after&#xD;
      the surgical cure. Fosamax is approved by the FDA for the prevention and treatment of&#xD;
      osteoporosis, and the goal of this project is to determine whether after successful surgical&#xD;
      cure of PHPT, Fosamax is even better for the skeleton than just parathyroid surgery alone.&#xD;

      Study Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: After successful surgical cure of primary hyperparathyroidism alendronate&#xD;
      provides even greater beneficial skeletal effects than parathyroidectomy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is typically a disorder of mild hypercalcemia. Skeletal&#xD;
      involvement can be demonstrated when bone densitometry is performed. Effects of excess PTH on&#xD;
      bone include preferential involvement of cortical bone (e.g. forearm) and relative sparing of&#xD;
      cancellous bone (e.g. vertebral spine). Bone properties, such as bone turnover, size and&#xD;
      geometry, are also altered in PHPT. The only cure for PHPT is removal of abnormal parathyroid&#xD;
      tissue. In the absence of medical intervention, bone mass increases briskly after successful&#xD;
      surgical treatment of PHPT. Parathyroid surgery also promptly reduces bone remodeling,&#xD;
      typically increased in PHPT, to normal values. Bone resorption markers fall first, followed&#xD;
      by bone formation markers. The difference in time course between the rapid fall in resorption&#xD;
      markers and the more gradual fall in formation markers provides a window of time when bone&#xD;
      mass increases rapidly. The post-surgical increase in BMD is attributed to a filling-in, or&#xD;
      mineralization, of the enlarged, PTH-driven, remodeling space. Whether further gains in bone&#xD;
      density could be achieved with more prompt and greater suppression of bone resorption in the&#xD;
      postoperative period is unknown. The potent bisphosphonate, alendronate (Fosamax), reduces&#xD;
      bone remodeling and enhances secondary mineralization. It has been shown to increase bone&#xD;
      density in subjects with PHPT who do not undergo parathyroid surgery. The goal of this&#xD;
      project is to test the hypothesis that after successful surgical cure of PHPT, alendronate&#xD;
      provides even greater beneficial skeletal effects than parathyroidectomy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical investigation will have as its primary outcome variable an increase in lumbar&#xD;
      spine density (DXA) when alendronate is used during the first year after surgery. The&#xD;
      patients will be stratified by BMD upon presentation, because we have shown a variable&#xD;
      response to parathyroidectomy depending on initial spine BMD. The study design is a&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, placebo, 1-year, controlled clinical trial, in which patients will&#xD;
      receive alendronate 70 mg weekly or a placebo tablet identical in appearance. As a secondary&#xD;
      endpoint, we also plan to examine the effects of alendronate after parathyroidectomy on bone&#xD;
      structure and skeletal dynamics using sensitive, state-of-the-art, non-invasive quantitative&#xD;
      tools. With central and peripheral quantitative computed tomography, we will investigate&#xD;
      changes in bone size, geometry and cortical porosity in cancellous and cortical bone. With&#xD;
      serum and urinary markers of bone turnover, we will determine whether alendronate hastens&#xD;
      control of bone resorption, thus enhancing the discordance between bone formation and&#xD;
      resorption and leading to even greater improvements in bone mineral density.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 3 Specific Aims; all measurable after successful parathyroid surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #1 to investigate the effects of alendronate on bone mineral density.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #2 to determine whether alendronate alters bone turnover to maximize the&#xD;
      augmented window defined by a rapid fall in bone resorption and a slower fall in bone&#xD;
      formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #3 to characterize the effects of alendronate on bone size and bone geometry in&#xD;
      the cancellous and cortical skeletal compartments using QCT and pQCT&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Specific Aim #1 we will obtain the data for our primary outcome. This will include data&#xD;
      regarding changes at the lumbar spine, as well as at the hip and distal 1/3 radius. The rate&#xD;
      of change in BMD at these sites will also be determined by BMD measurements within the 1-year&#xD;
      period of observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #2 will examine the potential mechanism for the greater improvements with bone&#xD;
      density, namely a change in bone turnover dynamics that would favor greater accumulation of&#xD;
      bone mineral with alendronate therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With Specific Aim #3 we will obtain more detailed information about changes in bone structure&#xD;
      that are likely to occur with more sophisticated tools than DXA. This will allow for specific&#xD;
      assessment of changes in cancellous vs. cortical bone and in bone size, geometry and&#xD;
      porosity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups of 20 patients each will self-administer a weekly oral pill, of alendronate or&#xD;
      placebo, for 12 months. This number will give us the statistical power to make the&#xD;
      observations that are planned. 18 subjects per group (n=36) allows detection of a between&#xD;
      group difference of 0.059 gm/cm2 in lumbar spine BMD at one year, with a power of 80%, using&#xD;
      a t-test and two-tailed alpha of 0.05. Calculation is based on our preliminary data in which&#xD;
      bone density improves 0.053 Â± 0.061 gm/cm2 (6.7% change) without intervention after surgery.&#xD;
      We will be able to detect an overall change in treatment group of 0.053 + .059 = .112 gm/cm2,&#xD;
      or 14% after surgery. We will recruit an additional 4 subjects (36+ 4 = 40) to account for&#xD;
      drop-outs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the main publication has been published, or within two years from the completion of data&#xD;
      collection, we will prepare a data sharing file that comprises the following components and&#xD;
      accompanying annotation: the protocol, procedures manual, operations manual, blank copies of&#xD;
      all report forms used in the study, the schedule of assessments, the data dictionary&#xD;
      providing data storage specifications for each field, the study database tables representing&#xD;
      the captured and audited data; the final data analytic data tables and the listing of the&#xD;
      programming statements responsible for any data recoding or sub-setting, data summaries of&#xD;
      each data table including descriptive statistics for validation of value integrity, and&#xD;
      written description of the study conduct and noteworthy details anticipated to potentially&#xD;
      affect data interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits and Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Certain tests will be performed as part of accepted procedures in patients with PHPT, but&#xD;
      most will be obtained specifically for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a total of 6 visits in the study: The pre-parathyroidectomy baseline/safety&#xD;
      visit (&quot;-1Month&quot; visit) which will occur approximately one month prior to parathyroidectomy,&#xD;
      and the post-parathyroidectomy baseline (&quot;Zero visit&quot;) where they will begin study drug.&#xD;
      There will also be a one-month (&quot;M1&quot;), three-month (&quot;M3&quot;), six-month (&quot;M6&quot;), and the&#xD;
      twelve-month visit (&quot;12M&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;-1Month&quot; visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this visit, potential participants will be screened into the study. That is, consent will&#xD;
      be obtained, inclusion and exclusion criteria will be satisfied, and baseline values will be&#xD;
      obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The testing that will be performed at this visit is divided into two categories: research and&#xD;
      safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Testing includes DXA, QCT, and pQCT as well as serum and urinary indices of bone&#xD;
      mineral metabolism (serum Calcium, PO4, Albumin, PTH, Vitamin D, P1NP, BSAP, and urinary NTX&#xD;
      and DPD). This reflects the standard baseline information captured prior to parathyroidectomy&#xD;
      in the clinical setting, which includes serum calcium, vitamin D, and PTH as well as bone&#xD;
      mineral density by DXA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Testing includes the lab tests being performed to satisfy inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. From the participants pre-surgical testing for their parathyroidectomy (which will&#xD;
      always include CBC, BMET, PT, PTT) we will be able to obtain baseline safety data. Other&#xD;
      baseline safety tests we will obtain are serum BUN, Creatinine, AST and ALT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The complete list of results being sought at the &quot;-1Month&quot; visit are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum BUN, Creatinine, AST, ALT, Calcium, PTH, Vitamin D, PO4, Albumin, P1NP, BSAP and&#xD;
      urinary NTX and DPD, as well as bone mineral density by DXA, QCT, and pQCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;ZERO&quot; visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to determine that parathyroidectomy is successful persons having this surgery&#xD;
      routinely have a serum Calcium and PTH performed. The results of the serum Calcium in&#xD;
      particular can immediately reflect the success of the surgery. Therefore, as a final&#xD;
      screening criteria, participants will provide us with the results of their routine&#xD;
      post-parathyroidectomy serum Calcium (and PTH, but that can be at a later time).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drug will be initiated no longer than one month after parathyroidectomy, since the&#xD;
      changes in mineral metabolism will likely start immediately after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this visit we will obtain serum Calcium and PTH for research purposes. We will also&#xD;
      randomize participants at this visit to receive either alendronate or placebo of alendronate.&#xD;
      We will provide participants with their study pills and they will take their first on the day&#xD;
      following the ZERO visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The complete list of things being done at the &quot;ZERO visit&quot;:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum Calcium and PTH&#xD;
&#xD;
      MONTH 1 visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum and urinary indices of bone mineral metabolism (serum Calcium, PO4, Albumin, PTH,&#xD;
      Vitamin D, P1NP, BSAP, and urinary NTX and DPD) will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MONTH 3 visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum and urinary indices of bone mineral metabolism (serum Calcium, PO4, Albumin, PTH,&#xD;
      Vitamin D, P1NP, BSAP, and urinary NTX and DPD) will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MONTH 6 visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum and urinary indices of bone mineral metabolism (serum Calcium, PO4, Albumin, PTH,&#xD;
      Vitamin D, P1NP, BSAP, and urinary NTX and DPD) will be collected and DXA will be performed.&#xD;
      Also, participants will be supplied with more study pills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MONTH 12 visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum BUN, Creatinine, AST, ALT, Calcium, PTH, Vitamin D, PO4, Albumin, P1NP, BSAP and&#xD;
      urinary NTX and DPD, as well as bone mineral density by DXA, QCT, and pQCT will be performed&#xD;
      at this visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alendronate, the study drug, has been shown to be very safe in many large, randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trials in individuals with osteoporosis and is FDA- approved for&#xD;
      prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. It has also been shown to be safe in individuals&#xD;
      with PHPT. In clinical practice, the most common side effect with alendronate is&#xD;
      gastrointestinal discomfort (for more information see RISKS). Study patients will be&#xD;
      instructed about how to administer the alendronate (or placebo) so as to minimize the&#xD;
      likelihood of this side effect.&#xD;
