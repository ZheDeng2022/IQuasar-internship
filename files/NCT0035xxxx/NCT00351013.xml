  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malaria accounts for over 40% of outpatient morbidity in Sierra Leone. These health risks&#xD;
      have been heightened further by the recent civil war, persistent poverty, lack of access to&#xD;
      affordable health care, and an increasing resistance of P.falciparum parasites to the most&#xD;
      commonly used therapy Chloroquine, which now has a confirmed failure rate of 39%. This study&#xD;
      will recruit 780 people from the Kroo-Bay community in Freetown. Healthy subjects would be&#xD;
      randomised into two subgroups and given either homeopathic pellets or placebo tablets at four&#xD;
      month intervals. They are then monitored repeatedly during the study period to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy of the therapy in reducing the disease burden.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this project is to evaluate the efficacy, costs and benefits of&#xD;
      homeopathic treatment therapies.This study will be conducted in the Kroo Bay community within&#xD;
      Freetown, the capital city of Sierra Leone. This is a region where malaria is endemic with an&#xD;
      annual average of one malaria episode per person.Further, given the high rates of poverty,&#xD;
      most residents cannot afford to purchase the conventional drugs used to treat the malaria.&#xD;
      Chloroquine, which is the cheapest drug available, is no longer efficacious for P.falciparum&#xD;
      parasites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will utilize a longitudinal approach that is divided into three major phases. The&#xD;
      first is a pre-test period involving the preparation and review of protocols, staff training,&#xD;
      purchase of equipment and medical supplies. Phase two constitutes an open randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial phase that is divided into five stages. The first stage IIA involves subject&#xD;
      recruitment from the Kroo-Bay community in the capital city of Freetown. Approximately 780&#xD;
      permanent residents (ages 18+) living within a radius of 10 km within the community would be&#xD;
      recruited. A questionnaire would be administered to evaluate personal case histories, use of&#xD;
      mosquito bed nets, frequency of malaria diagnoses, the kinds of treatments used in the past,&#xD;
      and knowledge of alternative treatment therapies. Other variables such as age, height,&#xD;
      weight, gender, occupation and socio-economic attributes would be collected. All subjects&#xD;
      would be tested for malaria using blood smears. Those who test positive for malaria, with&#xD;
      clinical symptoms such as high temperature (&gt;37.5 C) and high levels of parasitemia (asexual&#xD;
      forms of P falciparum &gt;5000ul blood) would be sent to the local clinic for treatment. These&#xD;
      individuals would constitute the first subgroup in the study sample. The remaining subjects&#xD;
      eligible for the clinical trial would be those with no major underlying illnesses, normal&#xD;
      body temperatures and a reduced load of asexual forms of P falciparum &lt; 5000ul blood). All&#xD;
      subjects would be monitored for four months and asked to return for their second prophylactic&#xD;
      treatment in four months (Day 112).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The next stage (IIB) begins after four months during which subjects are retested for malaria&#xD;
      and based on their blood sample results (negative), healthy subjects would be given another&#xD;
      dose of the pellets. They will be monitored for another four months. The same protocol is&#xD;
      followed in the next three consecutive stages (IIC, IID, and IIE). During each follow-up&#xD;
      visit, the subjects are retested and those with negative results are placed on their regimen&#xD;
      for four months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical trial phase ends after stage IIE. In the third phase, a post-intervention survey&#xD;
      will be given to all subjects to evaluate the levels of awareness of malaria and knowledge of&#xD;
      alternative treatment remedies. All data measures including, residential location, blood test&#xD;
      results, health histories and socio-demographic attributes would be compiled and analyzed&#xD;
      statistically to evaluate the effectiveness of the homeopathic treatment. The results are&#xD;
      expected to be published in a scientific peer-reviewed journal.&#xD;
