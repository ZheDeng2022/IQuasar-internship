      The &quot;Agricultural Health Study&quot; (AHS) is a collaborative effort between the National Cancer&#xD;
      Institute and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. The U.S. Environmental&#xD;
      Protection Agency and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health are providing&#xD;
      support for a limited exposure assessment effort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial data collection on a prospective cohort of 89,658 study subjects has been completed&#xD;
      as of December 1997. Participants completed questionnaires that included items on pesticides&#xD;
      used, other agricultural exposures, and work practices that modify exposure as well as on&#xD;
      other activities that may affect either exposure or disease risks (e.g., diet, exercise,&#xD;
      alcohol consumption, medical conditions, family history of cancer, other occupations and&#xD;
      smoking history). Phase II of the study (1998-2003) updated information on occupational&#xD;
      exposures, diet, work practices and medical history by means of a computer assisted telephone&#xD;
      interview. We also collected buccal cells on sample of 34,000 study participants to assess&#xD;
      the effect of inheritable polymorphisms and the interaction of environment and genomic&#xD;
      predisposition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stimulus for this prospective investigation comes from the growing evidence that, despite&#xD;
      a low mortality overall, farmers experience an excess of several cancers. These excesses have&#xD;
      been observed in retrospective epidemiological studies among agricultural workers in several&#xD;
      countries. Excess cancers are observed for the lymphatic and hematopoietic system, connective&#xD;
      tissue, skin, brain, prostate, stomach and lips. Several of these tumors (brain, NHL,&#xD;
      multiple myeloma, and prostate) are also increasing in the general population in many of&#xD;
      these countries. This suggests a common set of exposures may explain the high rates in&#xD;
      farmers and rising rates in the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Farmers, their families, and other pest control workers may have contact with a variety of&#xD;
      potentially hazardous substances including pesticides, solvents, fuels and oils, engine&#xD;
      exhaust, dust and zoonotic viruses and other microbes. Our cohort study includes all&#xD;
      registered pesticide applicators in Iowa and North Carolina and the spouse of applicators who&#xD;
      are farmers. The health effects of pesticide use are the primary focus of the study. The&#xD;
      influence of other farm exposures are also being evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The focus of the phase II follow-up period (2004-2008) is to update exposure information and&#xD;
      health histories by means of a computer assisted interview and also following the cohort to&#xD;
      determine disease incidence and mortality. The cohort is being followed through the cancer&#xD;
      registries within Iowa and North Carolina, the Social Security Administration database, state&#xD;
      vital statistics offices, National Death Index, and various in-state databases, such as the&#xD;
      listing of registered pesticide applicators. Individuals who enrolled into the study but who&#xD;
      are no longer at the address given during enrollment (based on subsequent attempts at follow&#xD;
      up) have been submitted and will continue to be submitted (through NIOSH) in the standard&#xD;
      format to the IRS under their Project 057 Taxpayer Address Request Program. Identifying data&#xD;
      provided to the IRS include only SSN and the first four letters of last name of cohort&#xD;
      member. IRS provides in return the most current address in IRS records if a match (SSN + all&#xD;
      four letter of last name) is found. The purpose of this effort is to identify members of the&#xD;
      cohort who have moved out of state, to enable adjustment of person-years for incidence and&#xD;
      mortality calculations. Persons who have moved out of state can be followed for vital status&#xD;
      and cause of death, but not for cancer incidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuation of the protocol will provide a valuable epidemiologic resource to help prevent&#xD;
      cancers in the future by identifying risk factors in the rural/agricultural environment.&#xD;
      Because more cases of important cancer outcomes occur in this cohort every year, potential&#xD;
      cancer causes can be evaluated with increased statistical power. Larger number of cases also&#xD;
      allows for statistical control of confounding factors, making more meaningful conclusions&#xD;
      about cancer risk, and, for some relatively infrequent cancers, such as the lyphomas and&#xD;
      leukemias, greater follow-up time is necessary to make any meaningful observations.&#xD;

        A prospective cohort of 89,655 registered pesticide applicators and spouses (57,310&#xD;
        applicators and 32,346 spouses of private applicators) with sufficient personal identifiers&#xD;
        to conduct follow up activities has been assembled during the first four years of&#xD;
        recruitment in the Agricultural Health Study, 1993-1997. The majority of@@@applicators were&#xD;
        asked to enroll in the AHS as they obtained or renewed their pesticide&#xD;
        registration/licenses through the agricultural extension services of the states of North&#xD;
        Carolina and Iowa. In the last year of enrollment, applicators who received or renewed&#xD;
        their pesticide licenses, but were never given the opportunity to enroll due to@@@added&#xD;
        requirements in the testing/training class, were called and asked to complete the&#xD;
        enrollment questionnaire over the phone. Spouses of the private applicators were also given&#xD;
        the opportunity to enroll via the telephone.&#xD;
