  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Indications for post-hysterectomy radiation therapy (RT) have been well established by&#xD;
      clinical data. Adjuvant RT has demonstrated local control and survival benefit. In patients&#xD;
      with nodal disease, adjuvant chemotherapy concurrent with radiation has further improved the&#xD;
      clinical outcome. The acute hematological and gastrointestinal toxicity of concurrent&#xD;
      chemo-radiotherapy can be quite high, sometimes preventing patients from completed their full&#xD;
      treatment course, potentially compromising the therapeutic benefit of treatment. Intensity&#xD;
      modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an advanced method of delivering external beam&#xD;
      radiation that may minimize the volume of normal tissue irradiated to high dose and thus&#xD;
      decrease the risk of normal tissue toxicity. Helical tomotherapy is a novel treatment device&#xD;
      with sophisticated imaging and treatment delivery features that are optimally suited for&#xD;
      IMRT. There are retrospective clinical data supporting the use of non-tomotherapy delivered&#xD;
      IMRT to treat patients with gynecologic cancers. The proposed study will prospectively test&#xD;
      whether helical tomotherapy is a feasible method for delivering IMRT in post-hysterectomy&#xD;
      cervical cancer patients receiving adjuvant RT. Here, the question of feasibility is simply&#xD;
      one of verifying that target volumes are reliably covered by 'sculpted' IMRT high-dose&#xD;
      regions. Although this is not a treatment effectiveness study, we will also follow the&#xD;
      clinical outcome of these patients, including toxicity, local control and survival, in&#xD;
      anticipation that this information will be valuable if the treatment modality is judged&#xD;
      feasible and will be used for further treatments of this patient population.&#xD;

      Patients with cervical cancer receiving post-operative radiotherapy (RT) for high risk&#xD;
      features found on pathologic review will be treated with pelvic intensity modulated radiation&#xD;
      therapy (IMRT). Helical tomotherapy will be used to plan and deliver the radiation treatment.&#xD;
      Treatment volume will include the upper third of the vagina and para-vaginal tissue and the&#xD;
      common, external and internal iliac nodal regions. External beam radiation will be delivered&#xD;
      in 180 cGy daily fractions to a total dose of 5040 cGy. Patients will receive once a day&#xD;
      treatment five days a week, for approximately 6 weeks. Concurrent chemotherapy and/or&#xD;
      intracavitary brachytherapy may be included in the treatment plan at the discretion of the&#xD;
      treating physician, consistent with routine clinical practice.&#xD;
