      Autism or Autistic Spectrum Disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting language,&#xD;
      communication, social interaction and behavior. Autism is a heterogeneous disorder makes the&#xD;
      assessment of treatment difficult. Only few measures have been used in a standardized way to&#xD;
      document the outcome of different modalities of treatment in autism. Most claims of treatment&#xD;
      effect in autism have been quite anecdotal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Traditional Chinese acupuncture, nearly 400 acupoints on the body surface are interrelated&#xD;
      to various functions. Acupuncture had been practiced in China for over 2 millennia. The&#xD;
      surface acupoints are linked through 14 meridians to various organs or viscera of the human&#xD;
      body. The approach in TCM, in sharp contrast to western medical concept, is a &quot;holistic&quot;&#xD;
      approach with a more philosophical background of balancing the &quot;Yin-and-Yang&quot;. The main&#xD;
      objective of TCM is to improve health of body and mind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiological basis of TCM aimed to improve &quot;energy&quot; or &quot;body-flow&quot; [&quot;de-qui&quot; in&#xD;
      Chinese]. Even a normal human subject will respond to acupuncture due to the flow of energy.&#xD;
      The effect of acupuncture was hypothesized and proven in animal and human studies to be due&#xD;
      to direct neural stimulation, changes in neurotransmitters such as endorphin, immunological&#xD;
      markers and endocrinological signals. Thus, acupuncture is Thus, acupuncture is effective in&#xD;
      chronic disorders, especially in neurological disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We had demonstrated clinical efficacy of acupuncturing the surface or base of the tongue in&#xD;
      specific acupoints in improving various functional modalities in patients with chronic&#xD;
      neurological disorders such as cerebral palsy, stroke and drooling problems. In our&#xD;
      experience, TCM approach for autism is more holistic. Autism is postulated as part of the&#xD;
      spectrum of lower intelligence. Thus, the approach to autism is considered as lower&#xD;
      intelligence due to &quot;Heart-meridian and Kidney-meridian yin-yang imbalance&quot; resulting in&#xD;
      communication problem and &quot;Liver-meridian yin-yang imbalance &quot; leading to behavioral&#xD;
      problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We attempted to use a different approach in looking at autism and to assess the efficacy of&#xD;
      an innovative method in TCM in improving the functional status of these children. Specific&#xD;
      acupoints in the tongue corresponding to various organs and meridians were used for autism.&#xD;
      The organ and meridian concept in TCM model has been assumed as a fundamental basis to&#xD;
      improve the behavior, cognition and communicative ability in children with autism. The&#xD;
      objective is to study the efficacy of a short course of TAC in improving the overall&#xD;
      functional status of autism.&#xD;
