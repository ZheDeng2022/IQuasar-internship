  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will investigate maternal and embryonic factors in women with recurrent implantation&#xD;
      failure, undergoing IVF/ ICSI treatment. Women who have not achieved a pregnancy after three&#xD;
      embryo transfer procedures will undergo an endometrial biopsy during the window of&#xD;
      implantation in a natural cycle. During the next treatment cycle we will aspirate endometrial&#xD;
      secretion and perform a doppler ultrasound investigation of the a. uterina. Moreover, we will&#xD;
      investigate the cytokine expression from the transferred embryo from the culture medium.&#xD;

      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite advances in IVF procedures and the transfer of embryos of high morphological quality&#xD;
      embryos, pregnancy rates from IVF remain around 30% per embryo transfer procedure. Failure of&#xD;
      the transferred embryo to implant remains the most important limiting factor determining in&#xD;
      vitro fertilization (IVF) or intra cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) success rates. If&#xD;
      progress is to be made in improving implantation rates, a greater understanding of the&#xD;
      factors which determine successful implantation is required. Recurrent implantation failure&#xD;
      after IVF may be due to an endometrial, and embryo problem or both. All women entering our&#xD;
      IVF program undergo pre-conceptional counseling and a pre-treatment blood withdrawal for&#xD;
      hormonal investigation and investigation of uterine cavity by ultrasound examination,&#xD;
      hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy. The data generated by this pre-treatment screening&#xD;
      potentially enables factors predictive of implantation failure to be identified. In addition,&#xD;
      study of the further IVF cycle will increase our knowledge of the factors of endometrial and&#xD;
      embryo factors involved in implantation failure, and aid in the characterization of the&#xD;
      different causes of this distressing clinical problem. On the basis of these data, rational&#xD;
      interventions designed to improve outcome can be designed and tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To delineate pre-treatment predictors of recurrent implantation failure, to characterize the&#xD;
      different phenotypes of women suffering from this problem and to study the relative&#xD;
      importance of maternal and embryonic causes of implantation failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, controlled cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      50 women who have received at least 3 embryo transfers in previous IVF cycles carried out&#xD;
      within the UMC Utrecht, without achieving a clinical pregnancy. The control group of 'normal&#xD;
      implanters' consists of 30 women who have previously readily conceived following ICSI for the&#xD;
      treatment of severe male subfertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Retrospective analysis of screening parameters, including analysis of endometrial biopsy&#xD;
           material for Noyes criteria of endometrial dating, uterine natural killer (uNK) cell&#xD;
           count and dietary/ lifestyle parameters obtained by questionnaire during&#xD;
           pre-conceptional counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Analysis of uNK cell count obtained from luteal phase endometrial biopsy prior to the&#xD;
           treatment cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Analysis of endometrial secretion and embryo culture medium cytokine expression profile&#xD;
           measured at the time of embryo transfer in a subsequent IVF cycle: comparison with&#xD;
           normal profile identified in the ICE study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Much of the data to be analysed will be collected from routine clinical work up&#xD;
      (pre-conceptional screening). Women with recurrent implantation failure then embarking on a&#xD;
      further IVF cycle will be invited to participate in this study and will undergo additional&#xD;
      investigation. This will include an endometrial biopsy prior to the treatment cycle, and&#xD;
      endometrial fluid aspiration prior to embryo transfer in the subsequent treatment cycle. No&#xD;
      negative effect on pregnancy rates from these interventions have been reported. The&#xD;
      theoretical risk associated with the aspiration of endometrial secretion before embryo&#xD;
      transfer might be disruption of embryo implantation. However, our group has developed a&#xD;
      technique which, as we have previously shown, does not disrupt the process of implantation.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who have not achieved a pregnancy, despite 3 subsequent embryo transfers, of&#xD;
             which only one is allowed to be a transfer of a cryo-thawed embryo. A chemical&#xD;
             pregnancy or E.U.G. will not be regarded as a pregnancy. An abortion will be regarded&#xD;
             as a pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  women older than 37 years.&#xD;
