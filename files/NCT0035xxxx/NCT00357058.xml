  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the role of different brain regions in tactile (touch) ability after&#xD;
      application of a tourniquet (inflated blood pressure cuff). When the forearm is deprived of&#xD;
      blood for a short period of time, tactile ability in the other hand improves. This study will&#xD;
      try to learn what causes this improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers are eligible for this study. Candidates will have a brief medical&#xD;
      history and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will undergo two experiments, described below, that involve the following&#xD;
      procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ischemic nerve block - A blood pressure cuff is inflated for 35-40 minutes around the&#xD;
           elbow area (also around the calf for Experiment 2 - see below). The resulting numbness,&#xD;
           tingling, loss of muscle strength, and discoloration of the forearm and hand disappear&#xD;
           within minutes after the cuff is deflated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) - This test uses a magnetic field and radio waves&#xD;
           instead of X-rays to produce images of brain structure and function. The volunteer lies&#xD;
           on a stretcher that is moved into the scanner (a cylinder containing a strong magnet),&#xD;
           wearing earplugs to protect the ears from loud thumping noises that occur with&#xD;
           electrical switching of radio frequency circuits. The subject can communicate with an&#xD;
           investigator by intercom at all times during the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) - An insulated wire coil is placed on the&#xD;
           patient's scalp. A brief electrical current passes through the coil, creating a magnetic&#xD;
           pulse that travels through the scalp and skull and causes small electrical currents in&#xD;
           the outer part of the brain. The stimulation may cause muscle hand or arm twitching or&#xD;
           transient tingling in the forearm, head or face muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tactile spatial acuity testing - The subject's left arm is placed in a cast and the left&#xD;
           index finger is immobilized for this test which involves identifying the direction of&#xD;
           grooves applied to the finger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      This experiment measures changes in tactile acuity and brain activation following cuff&#xD;
      inflation. The subject lies in the MRI scanner, with the left arm immobilized. Tactile acuity&#xD;
      is measured repetitively at the left index finger during placement and inflation of a&#xD;
      pressure cuff around the right forearm. The experiment consists of two sessions with the cuff&#xD;
      around the forearm and one with the cuff around the calf and lasts from 90 minutes to 2&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      This experiment measures changes in tactile acuity linked to TMS stimulation. The subject&#xD;
      sits in an armchair with the left arm immobilized. Tactile acuity is measured repetitively at&#xD;
      the left index finger during placement and inflation of a pressure cuff around the right&#xD;
      forearm. In addition, TMS pulses (about one pulse per second) are delivered at different&#xD;
      locations over the right side of the head for up to 30 minutes. The experiment consists of 10&#xD;
      separate sessions on different days, each lasting about 1 hour.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute deafferentation in one hand leads to improvements in tactile discriminative skills in&#xD;
      the other, non-deafferented hand. This phenomenon, recently identified in our laboratory,&#xD;
      represents an adaptive, behaviorally important consequence of deafferentation. It&#xD;
      demonstrates that acute loss of sensory input from one hand results in rapid improvement of&#xD;
      skills in the remaining hand. The first experiment in this protocol seeks to identify&#xD;
      cortical regions activated in association with this improvement in tactile spatial acuity. In&#xD;
      the second experiment, we will determine the effects of transient inactivation of focal&#xD;
      cortical regions on this behavioral gain. While the first experiment will characterize brain&#xD;
      regions activated in association with this performance improvement, the second experiment&#xD;
      will provide information on the functional role of these regions. Understanding the&#xD;
      substrates that mediate this behavioral gain may be important for the design of strategies to&#xD;
      enhance them.&#xD;
