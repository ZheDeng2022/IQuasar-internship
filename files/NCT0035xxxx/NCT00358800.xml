  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the use of REMStar Auto with C-Flex (RSA C-Flex) therapy in subjects&#xD;
      with previously diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea / hypopnea syndrome, during in-laboratory&#xD;
      studies. The study will determine the ability of RSA C-Flex therapy to effectively treat the&#xD;
      sleep apnea events. Mask leak and key sleep parameters will be monitored, and are expected to&#xD;
      be improved with C-Flex vs. CPAP therapy. Satisfaction from both patient and technician will&#xD;
      also be monitored.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research question we are exploring is whether the To determine if treatment with C-FLEX&#xD;
      is at least equivalent to conventional CPAP therapy as evidenced by standard sleep and&#xD;
      breathing variables and To determine if the treatment with C-FLEX has a positive impact as&#xD;
      determined by patient and technologist assessment of the PSG experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep laboratory rooms will be configured with a RSA device, which can deliver either&#xD;
      conventional CPAP or Auto CPAP with C-Flex. Each night the subjects eligible for the trial&#xD;
      will be interviewed, and consented for the study. The subjects will be instrumented for&#xD;
      polysomnography and PAP titration (with PSG recording of RSA flow, estimated tidal volume,&#xD;
      pressure, and estimated leak - via the Analog Output Module). Each subject will be instructed&#xD;
      in PAP therapy (using standard methods), and have an appropriate patient interface selected&#xD;
      per standard laboratory protocol. Each night, the patients will be randomized to either&#xD;
      therapy (conventional CPAP therapy without C-Flex, or RSA C-Flex). PSG will be schedules to&#xD;
      take place on consecutive nights when possible. The patient will not be aware of the therapy&#xD;
      they will be subjected to, but the night technician will be aware of the therapy choice. On&#xD;
      the next night, the subject will receive the alternative therapy (cross-over).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional CPAP without C-Flex CPAP pressure will be set to the therapy pressure determined&#xD;
      during a previous titration study. Technicians will record all interactions with the subject,&#xD;
      as well as any equipment used in the study. Study data will be analyzed for standard&#xD;
      polysomnographic outcome parameters listed below. Patient will complete a visual analog&#xD;
      satisfaction questionnaire following the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RSA with C-Flex RSA C-Flex will be set with pressure range from 4 to 20 cmH2O. Patients will&#xD;
      be arbitrarily set to a C-Flex comfort setting of 3 (maximum pressure relief). If the patient&#xD;
      comments about any sensation of 'breathlessness' due to the pressure relief, comfort setting&#xD;
      may be adjusted to 2 or 1 by the night technician. The subject is not informed of the therapy&#xD;
      selected for the study. Technicians will record all interactions with the subject, as well as&#xD;
      any equipment used in the study. Study data will be analyzed for standard polysomnographic&#xD;
      outcome parameters listed below. Patient will complete a visual analog satisfaction&#xD;
      questionnaire following the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic Data: Age, gender composition, body mass index, and baseline (diagnostic) AHI&#xD;
      will be presented with descriptive statistics. Appropriate statistical analysis will be&#xD;
      performed to compare the results of the titration night with REMStar Auto to the night on&#xD;
      conventional CPAP. Laboratory Experience: Number of interactions, types of interactions,&#xD;
      equipment used and VAS of both patient and technician will be recorded for each subject.&#xD;
      Polysomnographic Data, Cardiopulmonary and the process data will be collected and analyzed.&#xD;
