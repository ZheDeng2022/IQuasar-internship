  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder is a chronic and recurrent illness which involves episodes of mania and&#xD;
      depression. It is believed that disturbance of the stress hormone system (the&#xD;
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal or HPA axis) may cause thinking and memory problems and make&#xD;
      the depressive symptoms worse in bipolar disorder. Early studies have shown that mifepristone&#xD;
      may have antidepressant effects (may improve the symptoms of depression) and may also&#xD;
      maintain or enhance cognition (memory and thinking functions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the potential therapeutic efficacy (usefulness) of&#xD;
      mifepristone in bipolar depression by assessing the effects of the medication on depressive&#xD;
      symptoms and on cognition. This will be done by questionnaires and thinking tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also try to clarify the functional changes that accompany bipolar disorder by&#xD;
      analyzing saliva samples (assessing the stress response by measuring the levels of 2 stress&#xD;
      hormones: cortisol and DHEA).&#xD;

      Detailed Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a parallel design randomized control trial. Duration of study is 10 weeks&#xD;
      per subject. Following a baseline assessment of neurocognitive performance, mood symptoms,&#xD;
      and neuroendocrine functioning (HPA axis functioning), bipolar depressed outpatients (n=100)&#xD;
      will be randomized (week 0) to receive either mifepristone 600 mg daily (n=50) or matching&#xD;
      placebo (n=50) for 7 days. Outcome measures will be completed at baseline (pre-medication),&#xD;
      at the time of anticipated main response (week 3, i.e. 2 weeks after cessation of treatment),&#xD;
      and at week 8 (to determine the persistence of any effects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurocognitive performance (pre and post mifepristone treatment) will be evaluated with tests&#xD;
      that have previously been shown to be affected by corticosteroids and to be abnormal in&#xD;
      bipolar disorder. The neurocognitive battery will measure learning and memory, attention,&#xD;
      executive functioning, and facial expression (which has been shown to be a sensitive measure&#xD;
      of affective shift).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mood symptoms will be evaluated at every study visit using standard clinician and patient&#xD;
      self-rated scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuroendocrine functioning (HPA axis functioning) will be measured by the dexamethasone&#xD;
      suppression test (DST) response to dexamethasone. This is a measure of the function of the&#xD;
      glucocorticoid receptor. Subjects will also be asked for salivary samples to measure the&#xD;
      cortisol response to wakening and the ratio of cortisol to the protective steroid DHEA. These&#xD;
      validated tests will be used to improve our understanding of the mechanism of the therapeutic&#xD;
      effect of mifepristone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifty (50) matched-healthy controls will also undergo the baseline assessments of&#xD;
      neurocognitive performance, mood symptoms, and neuroendocrine functioning. They will provide&#xD;
      information about the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder.&#xD;
