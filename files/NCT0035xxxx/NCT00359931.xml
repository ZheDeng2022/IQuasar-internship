  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to compare brain function in three&#xD;
      groups of people: hearing-impaired people with tinnitus; hearing-impaired people without&#xD;
      tinnitus; and people with normal hearing and without tinnitus. Also known as &quot;ringing in the&#xD;
      ears,&quot; tinnitus is the false sensation of sounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults between 30 and 65 years of age who meet the following criteria may be eligible for&#xD;
      this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mild to moderate hearing loss who have experienced tinnitus daily for at least 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mild to moderate hearing loss who have never or rarely experienced tinnitus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Normal hearing who have never or rarely experienced tinnitus&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidates are screened with a medical history and questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants have a detailed hearing test to measure hearing and the nature of tinnitus. In a&#xD;
      second visit, subjects have a brief physical examination, followed by MRI scanning. MRI uses&#xD;
      a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of body tissues and organs. For this&#xD;
      procedure, the subject lies on a table that can slide in and out of the scanner (a narrow&#xD;
      cylinder), wearing earplugs to muffle loud knocking and thumping sounds that occur during the&#xD;
      scanning process. The subject may be asked to lie still for up to 8 minutes at a time. During&#xD;
      the MRI, the subject performs computer-based tasks that involve listening to sounds. Another&#xD;
      hearing test is done after the MRI.&#xD;

      Subjective tinnitus, the false perception of sound in the absence of an acoustic stimulus,&#xD;
      occurs frequently as a consequence of noise-induced deafness. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate the brain sites and mechanisms underlying tinnitus using a combined mathematical&#xD;
      modeling and functional brain imaging experimental approach. Although studies have focused on&#xD;
      the neural bases of tinnitus, it is not known why tinnitus arises only in certain cases of&#xD;
      hearing loss, and the contribution of different brain regions in tinnitus perception is&#xD;
      poorly understood. This in turn, prevents the development of better studies and new treatment&#xD;
      methods for tinnitus. The primary hypothesis is that a network of brain regions, from&#xD;
      auditory processing areas to emotional processing areas, contributes to, and modulates,&#xD;
      tinnitus perception. The brain imaging study will be used to study differences in the network&#xD;
      of brain regions involved in listening and discriminating sounds for tinnitus sufferers as&#xD;
      compared to a control group of subjects with similar hearing loss but without tinnitus. This&#xD;
      comparison should permit the identification of brain regions most active in tinnitus. An age&#xD;
      matched control group without hearing loss and tinnitus will be included to determine those&#xD;
      effects due to hearing loss alone. The mathematical computational modeling will use a&#xD;
      previously developed large-scale neural network model of auditory processing in the cerebral&#xD;
      cortex, which will be modified to induce tinnitus via different neural mechanisms. The&#xD;
      modeling study should allow us to evaluate the contribution of different cortical regions and&#xD;
      mechanisms to tinnitus perception; some changes in the model will be more successful than&#xD;
      others in inducing tinnitus and in matching simulated brain imaging data with experimental&#xD;
      brain imaging data. The modeling study will use the same stimuli and experimental paradigm as&#xD;
      the functional brain imaging study. Comparing the experimental and modeling results will&#xD;
      provide hypotheses about the most likely mechanism mediating tinnitus. Together, the modeling&#xD;
      and experimental studies will advance our knowledge of the brain regions and mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying tinnitus.&#xD;
