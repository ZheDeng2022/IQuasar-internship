      Objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the feasibility of an expertise-based randomized controlled trial (RCT) testing the&#xD;
      role of traditional surgery (OPEN) versus endovascular repair (EVAR) for abdominal aortic&#xD;
      aneurysms (AAA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct an expertise-based RCT comparing OPEN to EVAR of non-urgent abdominal aortic&#xD;
      aneurysms in patients referred to vascular surgeons practicing at Hamilton Health Sciences,&#xD;
      to determine the rate of death and other complications. Quality of life and status at 6&#xD;
      months will also be recorded. The ultimate goal is to determine the feasibility of conducting&#xD;
      a pragmatic expertise-based RCT and to inform a future larger study at a national level.&#xD;

      Background. The prevalence in individuals over 65 years of age is 6% (95% Confidence Interval&#xD;
      [CI] 5 - 6)(1-4)in men and 1% (95% CI 1 - 2) in women.(5) AAA confers a risk of spontaneous&#xD;
      rupture and death: the in-hospital mortality rate of ruptured aneurysms in Ontario was&#xD;
      estimated at 40.8%.(6) Prevention of spontaneous rupture is the rationale for surgical&#xD;
      intervention. Evidence has established that elective open surgery for AAAs &gt; 5.5cm increases&#xD;
      survival(7), but the 30-day perioperative mortality for elective open repair of AAA can be as&#xD;
      high as 8%.(8-17) Phase I and II trials have found that endovascular repair is a 'viable and&#xD;
      effective treatment' for AAA disease (18;19); the theoretical benefits include avoidance of&#xD;
      laparotomy and no aortic clamping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of RCTs (DREAM and EVAR-1)(20;21) have left unanswered the indications for&#xD;
      endovascular repair compared with open surgery because of problems with definition of&#xD;
      outcomes, lack of statistical power, and surgical expertise (surgeons needed to have done at&#xD;
      least 20 surgeries with or without supervision). The only studies addressing the issue of&#xD;
      expertise in this field suggests that 60 EVAR need to be done to achieve less than 10%&#xD;
      complications (22), and a time interval of less than 10 days between procedures is important&#xD;
      to maintain competence and reduce complications.(23) In addition the two RCTs used a&#xD;
      conventional design and we have reported that this has intrinsic pitfalls. We argued that in&#xD;
      surgery, particularly when a new technique is studied, another approach should be used: the&#xD;
      expertise based RCT.(24) Conventional RCTs typically randomize participants to one of two&#xD;
      interventions (A or B) and the same clinician give intervention A to some participants and B&#xD;
      to others. The expertise based randomized controlled trial, randomizes participants to&#xD;
      clinicians with expertise in intervention A or clinicians with expertise in intervention B,&#xD;
      and the clinicians perform only the procedure for which they have expertise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design/Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct an expertise based RCT comparing open repair with EVAR repair of elective&#xD;
      infrarenal AAAs. This is a pilot to determine the feasibility of a large pragmatic expertise&#xD;
      based RCT of open versus EVAR repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will consider all patients with an AAA determined to require non-urgent repair after&#xD;
      assessment by one of the participating surgeons. The second inclusion criterion is that the&#xD;
      blinded measurement team must deem a patient to fulfill the anatomic eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Location of Investigation&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will be conducted at a single institution: Hamilton Health Sciences,&#xD;
      Hamilton General Hospital. This centre will serve as the coordinating site for the future&#xD;
      multicentre randomized controlled trial, and based on the high volume practices of the&#xD;
      surgeons at the Hamilton General Hospital, will likely provide the largest pool of eligible&#xD;
      patients. Protocols and standard operating procedures for a single site will be developed for&#xD;
      this pilot, which will become standards for the larger trial. The decision to use a single&#xD;
      centre for this pilot study is based in the high expected surgical volume that makes our&#xD;
      recruitment rate realistic, in addition to the cost savings of conducting a trial close to&#xD;
      investigators and surrounded by known infrastructure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a patient is deemed eligible, the study nurse will provide the patient with details of&#xD;
      the study protocol and explanation of goals of the investigation, and obtain informed&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and Allocation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study nurse will be contacted by the surgeons' offices to screen all patients referred to&#xD;
      participating vascular surgeons on the first visit to the office and submit a standardized&#xD;
      electronic form accessible on a secure, encrypted website. This will document baseline&#xD;
      demographics for referred patients including key eligibility criteria. If these are met, the&#xD;
      study nurse will contact the patient, explain the study, determine the remaining eligibility&#xD;
      criteria and obtain consent. The nurse will use the electronic database to randomly allocate&#xD;
      the patient to open or endovascular repair. We will ensure concealment of allocation through&#xD;
      the use of a randomization and allocation process housed on an encrypted website monitored by&#xD;
      a data coordinator external to the study protocol. This process has been successfully&#xD;
      developed within the St Joseph's Nephrology, Thromboembolism and Vascular research group.&#xD;
      Randomization using random-sized permuted block technique will ensure balanced distribution&#xD;
      of patients and concealment of allocation. Once allocation has occurred, the study nurse will&#xD;
      coordinate patient appointments to the appropriate surgeon. Patients who do not meet&#xD;
      eligibility requirements will return to their original surgeon for disclosure of results and&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study nurse will meet the patient, document baseline characteristics and perform blood&#xD;
      work at the preoperative clinic visit. The study nurse will see patients daily after surgery,&#xD;
      arrange daily blood work and document all outcome events using standardized case report forms&#xD;
      until discharged from hospital. An outcome assessor committee independent of the study and&#xD;
      blinded to treatment allocation will adjudicate all outcome events. The study nurse will see&#xD;
      all patients at 3-month intervals for 6 months. The use of a 6-month outcome threshold is for&#xD;
      purposes of assessing feasibility in this pilot study only. The larger multicentre trial will&#xD;
      plan to evaluate outcomes up to five years, addressing the long term concerns that have been&#xD;
      raised in RCTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of Pilot Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will consider the pilot study a success if we can:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recruit 30 patients in 40 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Obtain a complete follow-up on 95% of the trial patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Demonstrate the feasibility of using a web-based system to randomize and follow patients&#xD;
           in this trial, and for outcome adjudication, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Document the resources (e.g., personnel time) required to conduct this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients in this study will provide informed consent prior to participation, and the&#xD;
      protocol will be reviewed by the Ethics Review Board of Hamilton Health Sciences.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients with an AAA determined to require non-urgent repair after assessment by one of&#xD;
        the participating surgeons will be considered. Patients must meet two eligibility criteria:&#xD;
        Medical and Anatomic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Medical Fitness for surgery will mean that the patient is a candidate for elective open&#xD;
        repair, and has none of the exclusion criteria listed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Anatomic Eligibility will be judged by the endovascular measurement team, and will be based&#xD;
        on a score of &lt; 3 on the following scale. (This scale was developed at our centre and is&#xD;
        currently being validated.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Neck Length (20 - 15 mm = 1; 14 - 10 mm = 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Quality of Neck (Thrombus 90 -180 º = 1, 181-270 º = 2; calcification 90 -180 º = 1;&#xD;
             181-270 º = 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Presence/absence side branches (IMA or lumbar vessels = 1; IMA and lumbar vessels or&#xD;
             other = 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Landing zone (aneurysmal or occlusive disease = 1; aneurysmal and occlusive disease =&#xD;
             2;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Degree of calcification of aorta (25 - 50% calcification = 1; &gt; 50% = 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Access (stenosis = 1; stenosis and tortuosity =2)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Stenting of accessory renal arteries necessary&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Embolization of internal iliac artery necessary&#xD;
&#xD;
        Definition of Surgical Experts&#xD;
&#xD;
        Expertise in endovascular surgery will be determined by completion of a vascular residency&#xD;
        at a credentialed academic centre, a period of study in a formal training programme&#xD;
        dedicated to acquiring endovascular expertise, and experience with at least 60 previous&#xD;
        EVAR procedures.30&#xD;
&#xD;
        Expertise in open aortic repair will require completion of an accredited vascular surgery&#xD;
        residency programme and demonstration of expertise by having completed at least 100&#xD;
        consecutive elective AAA repairs in their career.32&#xD;
&#xD;
        Endovascular Measurement Team The Endovascular Measurement team consists of at least one&#xD;
        vascular surgeon with expertise in endovascular surgery, at least one vascular fellow in&#xD;
        his/her first or second year of training and a representative from an endovascular graft&#xD;
        specialist who is familiar with graft measurement and deployment. This team, blinded to&#xD;
        patient demographics and surgical fitness, will judge anatomic eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Exclusion due to Medical Risk: Patients with severe cardiac or respiratory disease&#xD;
             that limits their activities of daily living and would make them ineligible for open&#xD;
             repair. BMI greater than 45. Any known diagnosis or condition that renders a lift span&#xD;
             of less than 2 years based on available and tolerable treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Exclusion due to Aneurysm Factors: Patients with ruptured or symptomatic aneurysms&#xD;
             requiring urgent surgery. Any aneurysm that extends proximal to the renal arteries&#xD;
             (suprarenal), involves the renal arteries or is less than 15mm distal to the level of&#xD;
             the lowest renal artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Exclusion due to Operative Factors: Patients with multiple previous laparotomies&#xD;
             making open repair contraindicated due to adhesions (a 'hostile abdomen'). Any&#xD;
             patients with stomas or exteriorized bowel. Patients with previous abdominal&#xD;
             radiation, Fitz-Hugh-Curtis, or history of other conditions that would render open&#xD;
             operative intervention contraindicated.&#xD;
