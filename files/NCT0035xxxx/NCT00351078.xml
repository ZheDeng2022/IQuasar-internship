  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In some patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), the disease is caused by a nonsense mutation&#xD;
      (premature stop codon) in the gene that makes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator&#xD;
      (CFTR) protein. PTC124 has been shown to partially restore CFTR production in animals with CF&#xD;
      due to a nonsense mutation. In an ongoing Phase 2a study being performed at the Hadassah&#xD;
      University Hospital - Mount Scopus in Israel, patients with nonsense-mutation-mediated CF&#xD;
      have received PTC124 in two 14-day treatment courses. Preliminary results from that study&#xD;
      indicate that PTC124 has pharmacodynamic activity of PTC124 in CF and that PTC124 can be&#xD;
      safely administered in this patient population. This Phase 2b extension study is designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the activity and safety of 3 months (approximately 84 days) of continuous treatment&#xD;
      with PTC124 in the same patients who were enrolled to the Phase 2a study. The main purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to understand whether PTC124 can be safely administered and achieve&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic activity in patients with CF due to a nonsense mutation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this study, the same patients who were enrolled in a previous study of PTC124 (protocol&#xD;
      number PTC124-GD-005-CF) will be treated with the investigational drug PTC124 for a period of&#xD;
      84 days. Evaluation procedures (history, physical examination, blood and urine tests to&#xD;
      assess organ function, electrocardiogram (ECG), chest x-ray, and CF-specific tests) to&#xD;
      determine if a patient qualifies for the study will be performed within 21 days prior to the&#xD;
      start of treatment. Eligible patients who elect to enroll in the study will be assigned to&#xD;
      receive PTC124 treatment (based upon TEPD results from the previous study) at 1 of the 2&#xD;
      following dose levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PTC124, given 3 times per day (TID) with a regimen of 4 mg/kg at breakfast, 4 mg/kg at&#xD;
           lunch, and 8 mg/kg at dinner, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PTC124, given 3 times per day (TID) with a regimen of 10 mg/kg at breakfast, 10 mg/kg at&#xD;
           lunch and 20 mg/kg at dinner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, PTC124 efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics will be evaluated&#xD;
      periodically with measurement of transepithelial potential difference (TEPD), medical&#xD;
      history, physical examinations, blood tests, urinalysis, sputum tests, ECGs, chest x-ray, and&#xD;
      pulmonary function tests.&#xD;
