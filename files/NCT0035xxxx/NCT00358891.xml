      Although previous studies showed that preterm infants resolving from neonatal respiratory&#xD;
      disease are more likely to exhibit respiratory illness, developmental disorders, impaired&#xD;
      growth and cognitive limitations compared with those without, the information concerning the&#xD;
      longitudinal respiratory and neurodevelopmental outcome of recently survived preterm infants&#xD;
      with CLD is limited.Therefore, the purpose of this study is threefold. First, VLBW infants&#xD;
      with CLD, VLBW infants without CLD and full-term infants will be examined for respiratory&#xD;
      health at 3-5 years old and will be assessed the relations of early respiratory and&#xD;
      environmental variables with later respiratory outcome. Secondly, all infants will be&#xD;
      examined for neurodevelopmental outcome, and will be assessed the relations of early&#xD;
      neuromotor and environmental variables with later neurodevelopmental outcome. Thirdly, the&#xD;
      VLBW infants will be assessed for the concurrent and consecutive longitudinal relationships&#xD;
      between respiratory and neurodevelopmental measures.&#xD;

      The introduction of antenatal steroid use, postnatal surfactant administration and modern&#xD;
      respiratory care in the past decade has markedly improved the survival of small preterm&#xD;
      infants. However, this has been offset by an increasing incidence of chronic lung disease&#xD;
      CLD) as defined by oxygen requirement at 36 weeks post-conceptional age. Although previous&#xD;
      studies showed that preterm infants resolving from neonatal respiratory disease are more&#xD;
      likely to exhibit respiratory illness, developmental disorders, impaired growth and cognitive&#xD;
      limitations compared with those without, the information concerning the longitudinal&#xD;
      respiratory and neurodevelopmental outcome of recently survived preterm infants with CLD is&#xD;
      limited. Therefore, this prospective three-year two-centered study will continue following up&#xD;
      the respiratory health and neurodevelopment of our 73 very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm&#xD;
      infants at preschool ages. This cohort consists of 44 infants with CLD and 29 demographically&#xD;
      matched infants without CLD who were enrolled from the National Taiwan University Hospital&#xD;
      and the MacKay Memorial Hospital. Those infants had been comprehensively examined for their&#xD;
      respiratory function and neurodevelopmental performance during the neonatal and infant&#xD;
      periods. Twenty five age-matched full-term infants will be additional included to serve as&#xD;
      the normal reference group. The purpose of this study is threefold. First, VLBW infants with&#xD;
      CLD, VLBW infants without CLD and full-term infants will be examined for respiratory health&#xD;
      using pulmonary function and exercise test at 3-5 years old and will be assessed the&#xD;
      relations of early respiratory and environmental variables with later respiratory outcome.&#xD;
      Secondly, all infants will be examined for neurodevelopmental outcome using the Bayley Scales&#xD;
      of Infant Development- 2nd edition, Developmental Test of Visual Motor Integration, Peabody&#xD;
      Developmental Motor Scale- 2nd edition, Child Behavior Check List, Weschler Preschooler&#xD;
      Intelligence Scale and clinical diagnosis by a pediatric neurologist and a pediatric&#xD;
      psychiatrist, and will be assessed the relations of early neuromotor and environmental&#xD;
      variables with later neurodevelopmental outcome. Thirdly, the VLBW infants will be assessed&#xD;
      for the concurrent and consecutive longitudinal relationships between respiratory and&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental measures. The results of this study will help understand the nature and&#xD;
      changes of respiratory health and neurodevelopment of VLBW infants with CLD from birth to&#xD;
      preschool age. The identified influencing factors for adverse respiratory and&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental outcome will assist health professionals in designing treatment strategies&#xD;
      to improve their outcome. Furthermore, the obtained database will help develop a national&#xD;
      monitoring system for measuring effects of respiratory management and early intervention&#xD;
      programs for preterm infants with neonatal respiratory disease.&#xD;
