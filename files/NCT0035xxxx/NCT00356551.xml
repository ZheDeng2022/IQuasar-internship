  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of this study are to evaluate the effects of an in-home parenting education&#xD;
      program, called Family Spirit, on parenting knowledge and skills and decreasing alcohol and&#xD;
      substance use compared to a breast-feeding education. In addition, we will assess aspects of&#xD;
      mother/child interaction.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the study, we employed a randomized controlled design using a blocked&#xD;
      randomization procedure. In this procedure, single woman and women with a participating&#xD;
      father were randomized in equal numbers to the Family Spirit or the breast-feeding education&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both treatment and comparison groups were assessed at multiple times. The number of times&#xD;
      depended on when the participant was recruited into the program. Women recruited into the&#xD;
      program between the study's start (May 2002) and January 31, 2004 were assessed at four&#xD;
      times: 1) The Pre-test occurs after informed consent (occurring at least 16 weeks before the&#xD;
      birth of the infant), 2) The Mid-Test at 6-8 weeks after the delivery of the infant, 3) The&#xD;
      Post-Test at 6 months post-partum (which is the end of the intervention period), and 4) The&#xD;
      6-month Follow Up Test occurs at 1 year post-partum. Women recruited into the program between&#xD;
      February 1, 2004 and March 31, 2004 (the date recruitment ended) were assessed at three&#xD;
      times: 1) The Pre-test occurs after informed consent (occurring at least 16 weeks before the&#xD;
      birth of the infant), 2) The Mid-Test at 6-8 weeks after the delivery of the infant, and 3)&#xD;
      The Post-Test at 6 months post-partum (the end of the intervention period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family Health Educator (FHE)s also conducted two instruments specific to child development:&#xD;
      the HOME and the ITSEA. The Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) was&#xD;
      administered at the Post-Test and Follow-Up points (just the post-point for women recruited&#xD;
      into the study between February 1, 2004 and March 31, 2004). This measure was an observatory&#xD;
      measure completed by FHEs and provided a systematic measurement of the family environment.&#xD;
      The Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) was a self-report form completed&#xD;
      by parents at their Follow-Up visit (not completed for women recruited into the study between&#xD;
      February 1 and March 31, 2004). This measure assessed social-emotional problems and&#xD;
      competencies in 12- to 36-month olds. FHEs also administered a Client Satisfaction Scale to&#xD;
      mothers in the (Family Support Person) FSP group who completed their participation in the&#xD;
      program. This Scale assessed their satisfaction with the various curricular sections and&#xD;
      their FHE.&#xD;
