      transplant from a living donor that is HLA-identical (has a similar immune system).&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a steroid-free and&#xD;
      calcineurin-inhibitor free treatment regimen for patients who are receiving a kidney&#xD;
      transplant from a living donor that is HLA - identical, or in other words, has a similar&#xD;
      immune system. The immune system is a defense system that the body uses to fight foreign&#xD;
      substances that enter the body, such as a transplanted kidney. Two people with similar immune&#xD;
      systems are less likely to fight off or reject an organ donated from one to the other.&#xD;
      HLA-identical kidney transplant recipients are less likely to need large amounts of&#xD;
      immunosuppression because they are immunologically similar. In this study, you will be&#xD;
      treated with the immunosuppressive medications, Cellcept, Rapamune, and Prograf and after a&#xD;
      rejection free period will remain on Cellcept alone. This treatment regimen is currently&#xD;
      being used at The University of Cincinnati for all HLA-identical living donor kidney&#xD;
      transplant recipients. This study is being conducted to determine if the protocol currently&#xD;
      being used results in beneficial outcomes for HLA-identical kidney transplant recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only recently have transplant centers considered avoiding steroid therapy (prednisone) in any&#xD;
      transplant patient because steroids have been used successfully for so long, but with many&#xD;
      side effects. The ability to stop steroids has occurred due to the availability of newer more&#xD;
      effective immunosuppressive medications. Stopping steroids has been tried in patients who are&#xD;
      considered to be at both low and higher risk of kidney rejection. Patients considered at risk&#xD;
      for rejection may typically be left on steroids forever or no attempts to stop the steroids&#xD;
      would be made until the patient is one year after transplant and has already received a lot&#xD;
      of steroid therapy resulting in side effects. This study will be conducted in patients that&#xD;
      are low risk for rejection and can potentially benefit from steroid avoidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, the concept of steroid avoidance in patients that are at low risk for rejection is&#xD;
      now much more acceptable because newer, more potent medications have recently become&#xD;
      available to prevent acute rejection. These newer medications include Prograf (tacrolimus),&#xD;
      Cellcept (mycophenolate mofetil), and Rapamune (sirolimus). Currently, most kidney transplant&#xD;
      recipients receive medications consisting of tacrolimus or cyclosporine, mycophenolate&#xD;
      mofetil or azathioprine, and steroids. However, recently, the combination of Prograf&#xD;
      (tacrolimus) and Rapamune (sirolimus) with steroid withdrawal 3 months after transplantation&#xD;
      was studied in patients receiving liver, liver/kidney, and kidney/pancreas transplants. This&#xD;
      study showed a low rate of acute rejection with excellent patient and kidney survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The addition of Cellcept to Prograf and Rapamune is thought to be a safe and effective&#xD;
      alternative to the use of steroids in transplant patients. Due to the low risk of rejection&#xD;
      for HLA-identical kidney transplant recipients, patients in this study will be slowly&#xD;
      withdrawn from both Rapamune and Prograf over a rejection free period of time. Withdrawal of&#xD;
      these medications and avoidance of steroids could decrease the development of high blood&#xD;
      pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, tremors, and infection after transplant. This study&#xD;
      will determine if this medication regimen is safe, effective, and able to produce beneficial&#xD;
      post transplant outcomes.&#xD;
