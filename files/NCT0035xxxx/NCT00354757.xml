      Background/Aim: To evaluate the optimal dosage of rabeprazole for proton-pump inhibitor (PPI)&#xD;
      testing of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and to test the influence of cytochrome P&#xD;
      (CYP) 2C19 polymorphism in a population with a high prevalence of people who poorly&#xD;
      metabolize PPIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods: In this randomized, open-label trial, patients with symptoms suggestive&#xD;
      of GERD were randomized to receive a two-week test with 20-mg or 40-mg rabeprazole after&#xD;
      diagnostic endoscopy. Symptom response was assessed with a four-grade daily record; in&#xD;
      addition, DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes was genotyped for CYP2C19 polymorphism with&#xD;
      polymerase chain reaction-restrict fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION A broad spectrum of symptoms are commonly associated with gastroesophageal&#xD;
      reflux disease (GERD), which has an incidence of roughly 20% in the general population.[1]&#xD;
      Despite recent, substantial advances in understanding GERD's pathogenesis, diagnosis still&#xD;
      presents many challenges. A rapid symptomatic response to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in&#xD;
      patients with a presumptive diagnosis of GERD is useful to validate diagnosis, which is known&#xD;
      as the PPI test. Studies addressing diagnostic PPI testing have produced valuable estimates&#xD;
      for Western populations regarding prediction of GERD in individual patients.[2][3][4] Some&#xD;
      population-specific features distinguish Asian patients from their Western counterparts.&#xD;
      First, the majority (75-90%) of Asian reflux patients have endoscopy-negative reflux disease&#xD;
      (ENRD).[1][5] Not all of them demonstrate a favorable response to PPI treatment because the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of ENRD is in part associated with psychosomatic pathways.[6][7] Second, PPIs&#xD;
      are eliminated by a hepatic route, with a polymorphically expressed cytochrome P (CYP) 2C19&#xD;
      primarily responsible for the rate of metabolism.[8] Compared with people who have a&#xD;
      homozygous wild-type genotype, people with a variant CYP2C19 allele exhibit lower rates of&#xD;
      PPI degradation, higher plasma PPI concentrations (3-to-13 times higher), and a lesser degree&#xD;
      of gastric acid secretion.[9] The prevalence of people who are poor metabolizers (i.e., have&#xD;
      a homozygous variant genotype) has been cited as 1.2% to 3.8% for Caucasian-European&#xD;
      populations, but 12.6% to 22.5% for Asian populations.[10] Lower gastric parietal cell mass&#xD;
      is also prevalent in Asians. These characteristics may augment the therapeutic effect of PPIs&#xD;
      in Asian patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When considering the pros and cons of PPI testing in an Asian population, the major pro is&#xD;
      that there will be a high prevalence of poor or intermediate metabolizers who may have an&#xD;
      increased serum level of PPI, resulting in a higher sensitivity, lower required dose of PPI,&#xD;
      and less cost in testing. The con is mainly related to the increased proportion of ENRD&#xD;
      patients. Up to 50% of ENRD patients, whose condition is termed functional heartburn, report&#xD;
      sufficient heartburn relief with PPI treatment.[6][11] Therefore, a higher proportion of&#xD;
      false positive cases may occur, which can lead to a decrease in test specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prediction of intra-esophageal damage is of paramount importance because patients with&#xD;
      erosive and non-erosive disease have distinctive manifestations and prognosis.[12] Therefore,&#xD;
      in this study, we tested the hypothesis that the PPI test can be used as a valid tool for&#xD;
      diagnosis of esophagitis in a Chinese population. Validation of the accuracy of PPI testing&#xD;
      would provide important information for comparison of diagnosis with the traditional&#xD;
      endoscopy-first approach. We selected rabeprazole as the PPI test agent because it is well&#xD;
      tolerated and can effectively prevent pathological and symptomatic GERD relapse.[13][14]&#xD;
      Another potential benefit is that a variable proportion of rabeprazole degradation proceeds&#xD;
      through a non-enzymatic pathway.[15][16] Thus, a decrease in inter-individual variability in&#xD;
      serum PPI level may prove the rabeprazole-based regimen to be a diagnostic test with stable&#xD;
      accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENTS &amp; METHODS Patients A consecutive series of patients with symptoms suggestive of GERD&#xD;
      were enrolled from the Gastroenterology outpatient clinic in our institution. The typical&#xD;
      GERD symptom was defined as heartburn and/or acid regurgitation of at least three episodes&#xD;
      per week for a minimum of three months. Patients who received concurrent PPI treatment, had a&#xD;
      medical contraindication to rabeprazole therapy, reported a history of peptic ulcer disease&#xD;
      or gastrointestinal surgery, peptic ulcer disease or malignancy proven by endoscopy, the&#xD;
      presence of alarm features (e.g., dysphagia, weight loss, bleeding, abdominal mass, and/or&#xD;
      anemia), or who were unwilling or unable to provide informed consent were excluded from the&#xD;
      study. Participants provided informed consent, and the Ethics Committee of National Taiwan&#xD;
      University Hospital approved the study protocol prior to implementation (no. 940711).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol All enrolled patients underwent an initial diagnostic evaluation with upper&#xD;
      endoscopy and were classified with erosive or non-erosive disease. After endoscopy, patients&#xD;
      in the two groups were randomly assigned to receive either one tablet of rabeprazole 20mg&#xD;
      before breakfast or two tablets of rabeprazole before breakfast and dinner for 2 weeks. The&#xD;
      random allocation was performed by choosing cards in sealed envelopes. Patient response to&#xD;
      PPI treatment was recorded in a diary (illustrated below). Patients were notified about&#xD;
      endoscopy results only at study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopy After an overnight fast, all subjects were placed in the left lateral decubitus&#xD;
      position. Endoscopy was performed by experienced endoscopists at our academic institution.&#xD;
      During the procedure, the stomach and duodenum were inspected to exclude possible lesions.&#xD;
      The distal portion of the esophagus was evaluated carefully to determine the presence of any&#xD;
      mucosal injury. The definition of reflux esophagitis rested on demonstration of diffuse or&#xD;
      streaking erythema, mucosal friability, and the presence of erosions or ulcers, i.e., mucosal&#xD;
      breaks. Severity was assessed according to the Los Angeles (LA) classification with standard&#xD;
      comparator photos, a reference standard in diagnosis of GERD.[17]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptom Assessment Patients kept a daily diary record of the severity of their reflux&#xD;
      symptoms for the 14 days of PPI therapy. The evaluation scale was adapted from the scale used&#xD;
      in the Dickman trial [18] and was translated into Chinese. The scale was as follows: (1) mild&#xD;
      symptoms that were easily tolerated and did not last long; (2) moderate symptoms that caused&#xD;
      some discomfort but did not interfere with usual activities; (3) severe symptoms that caused&#xD;
      much discomfort and interfered with usual activities; and (4) disabling symptoms that were&#xD;
      unbearable and interfered considerably with usual activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses of CYP2C19 Genotypes For genotype analysis, each patient's peripheral blood&#xD;
      leukocytes were obtained and their DNA was extracted. Genotyping procedures that identified&#xD;
      the CYP2C19 wild-type allele and the two known mutant alleles, CYP2C19m1 in exon 5 and&#xD;
      CYP2C19m2 in exon 4, were carried out by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment&#xD;
      length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique with allele-specific primers.[19] On the basis of&#xD;
      their ability to metabolize PPI, individuals were classified as extensive metabolizers&#xD;
      (homEM: homozygous for wild-type allele), heterozygous extensive metabolizers (hetEM: carrier&#xD;
      of only one mutant allele), or poor metabolizers (PM: homozygous for variant allele). All&#xD;
      laboratory procedures were performed blind to the patient's randomization status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Quantitative data were summarized as mean Â± standard deviation (SD), and&#xD;
      categorical variables were summarized as percentages. Between study groups, categorical&#xD;
      variables were compared with the 2 test, quantitative data with the independent t-test, and&#xD;
      ordinal data with Wilcoxon's two-sample test. To identify the best cutoff value of symptom&#xD;
      reduction for prediction of GERD, we compared three levels for a positive response (25%, 50%,&#xD;
      and 75% symptom reduction from baseline) by calculating the areas under the&#xD;
      receiver-operating curve (ROC) in a prediction model. In this model, the dependent variable&#xD;
      was diagnosis of GERD, and a positive therapeutic response was treated as the main&#xD;
      independent variable. Covariants included age, male gender, body mass index (BMI), and social&#xD;
      habits (e.g., smoking and alcohol), all of which are known to be associated with risk of&#xD;
      GERD.[1] According to the best definition for positive response, diagnostic parameters were&#xD;
      calculated for sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive&#xD;
      value (NPV), and accuracy. To assess the effect of CYP2C19 polymorphic genotype, results were&#xD;
      stratified and compared according to carrier status (e.g., homEM, hetEM, and PM). The&#xD;
      Cochran-Armitage trend test assessed whether there was a therapeutic difference across the&#xD;
      three genotype classes. All P values were two sided, and P &lt; 0.05 indicated statistical&#xD;
      significance. Analyses were performed with statistical software (SAS, version 8.0; SAS&#xD;
      Institute Inc., Cary, NC).&#xD;
