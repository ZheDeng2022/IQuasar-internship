  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A probiotic bacterial strain was tested in a randomized, double blind , placebo controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial with 54 healthy male volunteers. Half the volunteers received the dietary&#xD;
      supplement the other half placebo during 6 weeks prior to exposure to solar-simulated UV&#xD;
      irradition (2x1,5MED). Blister roofs and skin biopsies were recovered 1, 4 and 10 days after&#xD;
      UV exposure from unirradiated and irradiated skin and used for immunohistochemical analysis&#xD;
      and mixed epidermal cell lymphocyte reaction&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Langerhans cells (LC), the dendritic cells (DC) from epidermis, constitute the first line of&#xD;
      immune defense against environmental attacks. Under steady state conditions, LC turnover is&#xD;
      very low. The LCs reside in the epidermis in an immature state and can be distinguished from&#xD;
      other epidermal cells by their surface expression of HLA-DR, CD1a and langerin. Upon&#xD;
      stimulation by inflammatory mediators LCs are activated and acquire CCR7 expression, the&#xD;
      chemokine receptor for CCL21 that mediates their migration to lymph nodes. Moreover,&#xD;
      activated LCs display a mature phenotype characterized by increased expression of&#xD;
      co-stimulatory molecules and acquisition of maturation markers that facilitate their&#xD;
      interaction with T-cells and aid in the elicitation of the immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has long been known that, in addition to being carcinogenic via DNA damage and mutations,&#xD;
      solar UV radiation induces local and systemic immune suppression which represents a major&#xD;
      risk for skin cancer induction and progression in sun-exposed areas. The process is mostly&#xD;
      related to direct LC damage through induction of apoptosis and impairment of&#xD;
      antigen-presenting function. Moreover, UV radiation elicits an inflammatory response and&#xD;
      subsequent recruitment of immune cells, including CD36+ monocytic cells. These cells colonize&#xD;
      the epidermis in the days following UV exposure and are the major source of immunosuppressive&#xD;
      cytokines such as IL-10. All these mechanisms ultimately lead to impaired cell-mediated&#xD;
      reactions and establishment of immune tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutritional intervention, particularly with dietary antioxidants and vitamins, has been&#xD;
      proposed to protect against UV-induced skin damage and to a certain extent skin cancer&#xD;
      occurrence. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest for probiotics, defined as&#xD;
      live microorganisms which, when consumed in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit upon&#xD;
      the host. Particular focus has been on species of lactic acid bacteria including Lactobacilli&#xD;
      and Bifidobacteria that are part of the natural human intestinal microbiota. Indeed, it is&#xD;
      well documented that the endogenous intestinal microbiota plays a crucial role in immune&#xD;
      maturation, gut integrity and defense against pathogens. Recently, it has been shown that&#xD;
      some probiotic bacteria possess the ability to modulate the immune system at both the local&#xD;
      and systemic levels and thereby improve immune defense mechanisms and/or down-regulate immune&#xD;
      disorders such as intestinal inflammations or allergies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Probiotic used as the dietary supplement, was isolated from healthy adult microbiota and&#xD;
      was shown to have a strong anti-pathogenic activity against a wide range of entero-pathogens.&#xD;
      Furthermore, a pre-clinical study demonstrated that it can maintain the epidermal LC density.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here, we analyzed, in a randomized double blind, placebo controlled, clinical trial, whether&#xD;
      this dietary supplement could also modulate the cutaneous immune homeostasis after&#xD;
      solar-simulated UV exposure in humans.For this purpose, we analyzed whether this dietary&#xD;
      supplement could interfere with LC allostimulatory function and activation/maturation&#xD;
      phenotypic status of skin DC, after solar-simulated UV irradiation.&#xD;
