      Comparison of efficacy and toxicity of the combination treatment of deferiprone and&#xD;
      desferrioxamine with the single agent treatment of either drug&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with refractory anemias requiring regular blood transfusions accumulate iron at the&#xD;
      rate of approximately 0.5 mg/kg/day, which may lead to serious organ toxicity. The human body&#xD;
      has no active mechanism for the excretion of excess iron. Therefore multiply transfused&#xD;
      patients will develop a secondary hemosiderosis, if no iron excretion is achieved by a&#xD;
      chelating agent. Symptoms of iron-overload occur when body iron stores reach 10-20 g. At&#xD;
      higher levels severe, even fatal complications, particularly cardiac failure, may develop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Desferrioxamine (DFO, Desferal) is the established and commonly used iron-chelating drug, but&#xD;
      is expensive and must be given by slow subcutaneous or intravenous infusion for 8-12 hours a&#xD;
      day during 5-7 days weekly at a dosage of 40-50mg/kg body weight/day. This often leads to&#xD;
      failure of compliance of the patient and therefore to inefficient iron chelation. Further&#xD;
      some patients are hypersensitive to desferrioxamine and others suffer from toxicity, e.g. to&#xD;
      the ears or eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deferiprone (L1; CP20; 1,2 dimethyl-3-hydroxy-pyrid-4-one) is an orally active iron chelator&#xD;
      investigated in various clinical trials since 1987. Dosages of 75 - 100mg/kg body weight/day&#xD;
      of L1 have been found effective to maintain stable iron balance (urinary iron excretion of&#xD;
      0.5mg/kg/day) and to reduce serum ferritin levels between 6% and 25% within one year of&#xD;
      treatment in iron-overloaded thalassemic patients. There exists long-term experience with&#xD;
      patients who have received deferiprone continuously for more than 10 years so far. However,&#xD;
      only few controlled comparison studies with L1 and DFO have been performed so far in order to&#xD;
      confirm the effectiveness of deferiprone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main side effects encountered during a deferiprone therapy are arthropathy,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, and mild zinc deficiency. These adverse effects are&#xD;
      usually reversed on reducing the dose or discontinuing the drug. Except for severe joint&#xD;
      symptoms in few patients, most of the subjects in different clinical trials have been able to&#xD;
      continue with L1 therapy for a long-term. The most severe and rare complication following L1&#xD;
      administration is agranulocytosis or neutropenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new treatment regimen by combining deferiprone with desferrioxamine is currently being&#xD;
      investigated in many countries. Preliminary data could demonstrate that the combined use of&#xD;
      both drugs is highly active showing a synergistic or even additive effect (significant&#xD;
      decrease of serum ferritin and hepatic iron content, increase of urinary iron excretion).&#xD;
      This synergism could be explained by the different mode of activity of the two drugs. It&#xD;
      could be demonstrated that patients who were not sufficiently chelated with desferrioxamine&#xD;
      or deferiprone, could achieve a negative iron balance with the combination treatment of both&#xD;
      drugs. The combined regimen was generally well-tolerated and there is evidence that the&#xD;
      individual toxicity profile of both drugs can be positively influenced by the simultaneous&#xD;
      administration of L1 and DFO. The daily treatment with L1 tablets combined with a twice a&#xD;
      week administration of parenteral desferrioxamine is more patient-convenient and therefore&#xD;
      may enhance the compliance of the patient. In addition, this new treatment regimen will&#xD;
      reduce the overall therapy expenses if compared to the high Desferal and material costs&#xD;
      related to the parenteral administration of DFO on 5 to 7 days per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the previous studies with deferiprone are often not comparable, e.g.&#xD;
      laboratory parameters, toxicities and side effects vary from study to study. The number of&#xD;
      patients included in the clinical investigations was in general too low to allow&#xD;
      statistically significant evaluations. Further, there is no controlled randomized study&#xD;
      comprising an appropriate number of patients in order to allow a comparison between the&#xD;
      combination arm and the single agent control arms. This study protocol aims to evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility of the combination treatment by comparing the efficacy and safety of the combined&#xD;
      drugs with the single agent treatment of L1 and DFO in iron-overloaded patients with&#xD;
      thalassemia or refractory anemia in a controlled randomized multicenter study.&#xD;
