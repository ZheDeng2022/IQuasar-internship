    <textblock>
      Azacitidine is a drug that is designed to block certain genes in cancer cells whose job is to&#xD;
      stop the function of the tumor-fighting genes. By blocking the &quot;bad&quot; genes, the&#xD;
      tumor-fighting genes may be able to work better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you can start treatment on this study, you will have what are called &quot;screening&#xD;
      tests.&quot; These tests will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in this&#xD;
      study. You will have a complete medical history and physical exam. Women who are able to have&#xD;
      children must have a negative blood pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be given chemotherapy,&#xD;
      before the transplant of donor cells. There are 2 major goals to giving this chemotherapy.&#xD;
      One goal is to directly kill leukemic cells. The other goal is to block your ability to&#xD;
      reject the donor cells that will be given to your for the transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive a combination of 3 chemotherapy drugs--gemtuzumab, fludarabine,&#xD;
      and melphalan. In order to receive gemtuzumab, your bone marrow leukemia cells have to be&#xD;
      positive for a marker called &quot;CD33,&quot; which is present in the majority of myeloid leukemias.&#xD;
      If your cells are negative for that marker, the chemotherapy you receive will not include&#xD;
      gemtuzumab. Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) will be given to patients receiving stem cells from&#xD;
      an unrelated donor, or from a relative that is not fully matched with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All chemotherapy drugs are given by vein through a silicone catheter. Gemtuzumab is given 12&#xD;
      days before the transplant (may be given as an outpatient infusion). Fludarabine is given&#xD;
      once a day for 4 days (5-2 days before the transplant), and melphalan is given as a single&#xD;
      dose 2 days before the transplant. If you are receiving ATG, this drug will be given in 3&#xD;
      doses, given 3-1days before the transplant. The transplant day is usually referred to as &quot;Day&#xD;
      0.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 5 bone marrow biopsies will be collected during the first year after&#xD;
      transplantation--before the start of treatment, around 1 month after transplantation, and&#xD;
      around 4, 9, and 12 months after transplantation. To collect a bone marrow sample, an area of&#xD;
      the hip bone is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone marrow and bone is&#xD;
      withdrawn through a large needle. The bone marrow samples will be used primarily for disease&#xD;
      status evaluation, but researchers will also use the samples for research on the way&#xD;
      azacitidine works.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eleven (11) blood samples (2 teaspoons each) will be collected for research purposes during&#xD;
      the 1 year of your participation in this study. Samples will be collected before&#xD;
      chemotherapy, before stem cell transplantation, before and after you receive 5-azacitidine&#xD;
      (for each of the 4 cycles of treatment), and on the third week of the first cycle of&#xD;
      5-azacitidine treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the blood-forming cells are collected from the donor, they will be given to you by vein&#xD;
      for your transplant. Before the infusion, you will receive medications, such as steroids and&#xD;
      Benadryl (diphenhydramine), to decrease the risk of side effects. These &quot;premedications&quot; are&#xD;
      given by vein usually 30 to 60 minutes before the transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive several medications to help the treatment work and to help decrease the&#xD;
      risks of infections while your immune system is weak. Tacrolimus and methotrexate will be&#xD;
      given to decrease the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a problem that may occur if&#xD;
      the donor's immune cells fight your body. Tacrolimus will be started 2 days before the&#xD;
      transplant and will continue for a variable period of time (e.g., 3-12 months, or longer if&#xD;
      you develop GVHD). Tacrolimus is given by vein at first and then by mouth, when patients are&#xD;
      able to eat. Methotrexate is given by vein 1, 3, and 6 days after transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several medications are used for the prevention of infections (potentially caused by fungal,&#xD;
      bacterial, and viral organisms). Some of these antibiotics are given by vein, and some are&#xD;
      given as pills, for variable lengths of time. You will receive medications while you are on&#xD;
      tacrolimus or other medications that may weaken your immune system (such as steroids), in&#xD;
      order to prevent infections, such as pneumonia. These antibiotics may include Bactrim,&#xD;
      Diflucan, or other medications, if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be in the hospital for about 3-4 weeks after the transplant. You will have check-ups&#xD;
      every day until you leave the hospital. After you leave, the frequency of clinic visits will&#xD;
      vary, depending on your condition. You may need to come to the hospital as often as daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If your first bone marrow examination after transplantation determines that you are in&#xD;
      remission, you will be eligible to receive azacitidine in one of 3 doses. Your dose and&#xD;
      schedule of administration will be decided before you start the treatment. Participants will&#xD;
      be enrolled starting with the smallest dose and moving upwards in terms of dose, if no side&#xD;
      effects are detected. Each participant will have an assigned dose. This dose may be decreased&#xD;
      or may be stopped or may not be given at all if certain side effects develop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Azacitidine will be given as an injection under the skin once a day over 5 days in a row.&#xD;
      This may be repeated once a month for up to 4 months after the transplant. You will be&#xD;
      assigned to receive the drug for one to four cycles. You will have about 25 days of &quot;rest&quot;&#xD;
      between each cycle of treatment (a cycle is the period of 1 month.). If intolerable side&#xD;
      effects occur, treatment with azacitidine may be interrupted or stopped altogether before you&#xD;
      finish treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While on study, you will need to stay in Houston for up to 5 months after your transplant.&#xD;
      You will then be required to return at 9 and 12 months after the transplant, though the&#xD;
      frequency of the visits may be higher, if thought necessary by your doctor. After 1 year,&#xD;
      your follow-up will continue as is standard of care for your disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Azacitidine and the other drugs described here are approved&#xD;
      by the FDA. The use of azacitidine after allogeneic transplantation is experimental.About 90&#xD;
      patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
