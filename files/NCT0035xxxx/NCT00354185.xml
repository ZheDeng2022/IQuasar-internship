  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of giving PDX101 together with&#xD;
      17-AAG in treating patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors or lymphoma. PDX101&#xD;
      may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth&#xD;
      and by blocking blood flow to the cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), work in different ways to stop the growth&#xD;
      of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving PXD101&#xD;
      together with 17-AAG may kill more cancer cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of PXD101 and 17-AAG administered to patients with&#xD;
      refractory solid tumor malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose of PXD101 and&#xD;
      17-AAG in patients with refractory solid tumor malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of PXD101 and 17-AAG in patients receiving this&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the antitumor activity of this combination, per tumor measurements using the&#xD;
      RECIST criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the effect of treatment with PXD101 and 17-AAG on the transcriptional&#xD;
      upregulation of targeted genes in tumor and surrogate tissue (PBMCs) by means of RTPCR and&#xD;
      incorporation of the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the effect of this combination treatment on the post translational&#xD;
      modification of histones from tumor and surrogate tissue (PBMCs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) IV over 2 hours on days 1,&#xD;
      4, 8, and 11 and PXD101 IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 21 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 17-AAG and PDX101 until the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2&#xD;
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Up to 12 patients are treated at&#xD;
      the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo blood collection on days 1 and 4 of course 1 for pharmacokinetic studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;

             Chair; efforts should be made to switch patients who are taking enzyme-inducing&#xD;
             anticonvulsant agents to other medications&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of PXD101 and 17AAG on the developing human fetus are unknown; for this&#xD;
             reason and because HDAC inhibitors as well as other therapeutic agents used in this&#xD;
             trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree&#xD;
             to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a&#xD;
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study,&#xD;
             she should inform her treating physician immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Within 4 weeks of first treatment: Left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 45% per&#xD;
             nuclear cardiac imaging or echocardiography&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not&#xD;
             recovered (≤ grade 1) from clinically significant adverse events due to agents&#xD;
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to PXD101; there are no known allergic reactions attributed to compounds&#xD;
             of similar chemical or biological composition to 17AAG; patients with known egg&#xD;
             allergy should be excluded as the agent is diluted in EPL diluent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should not have taken valproic acid, another histone deacetylase inhibitor,&#xD;
             for at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because PXD101 is an HDAC inhibitor with&#xD;
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown&#xD;
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with PXD101, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with&#xD;
             PXD101; these potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with PXD101; in addition, these&#xD;
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy; appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients&#xD;
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions to eggs&#xD;
&#xD;

          -  Patients who have a history of serious ventricular arrhythmia (VT or VF, &gt;= 3 beats in&#xD;
             a row) or QTc &gt;= 450 msec for men and 470 msec for women or a history of long QT&#xD;
             Syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients taking concomitant medications that prolong or may prolong QTc or may cause&#xD;
