  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are a major problem facing our society. Their treatment is&#xD;
      complex, and involves multiple behavioral and pharmacotherapy interventions. There are 3&#xD;
      approved medications for AUDs, but their efficacy for AUDs that co-exist with anxiety&#xD;
      disorders is unknown. This study explores the effects of the medication, sustained-release&#xD;
      quetiapine fumarate (Seroquel SR) for the treatment of alcohol dependence and co-morbid&#xD;
      anxiety. Primary outcome measure is the amount of alcohol used. Secondary outcome measures&#xD;
      include craving for alcohol, length of sobriety from drinking and level of anxiety with&#xD;
      Seroquel SR.&#xD;

      STUDY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this proposal is to study the efficacy of the medication Seroquel SR for the&#xD;
      treatment of alcohol dependence and co-morbid anxiety in a prospective double blind&#xD;
      placebo-controlled randomized clinical study. Patients, meeting the DSM-IV criteria for&#xD;
      Alcohol Dependence and an Anxiety Disorder, will be enrolled and randomized to receive&#xD;
      placebo or Seroquel SR. All subjects will be referred to usual treatment program, where they&#xD;
      can receive group/self help group therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a 12-week prospective, double blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of&#xD;
      Seroquel SR in patients who meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric&#xD;
      Disorders (DSM-IV) criteria for alcohol dependence and anxiety disorders. Potential&#xD;
      candidates will be allowed sufficient time to review the consent document and ask questions&#xD;
      about the trial prior to signing the consent document. Consenting adults will be randomized&#xD;
      to receive active medication, Seroquel SR or placebo for 12-weeks. The study will enroll 20&#xD;
      patients, 10 will be randomized to receive Seroquel SR, and 10 will receive placebo. All&#xD;
      participants will also be referred to usual alcohol treatment, including individual, group&#xD;
      and/or self help group therapy (Alcoholics Anonymous).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to receive either Seroquel SR or placebo. Dosing of Seroquel SR&#xD;
      will occur on the following schedule: At the baseline visit, Seroquel SR will be started at&#xD;
      50 mg QHS for Day 1 and 2, and dose increase to 150 mg QHS on day 3-4, and increased further&#xD;
      to 300 mg QHS from day 5-day 42. After day 5, the Seroquel SR dosage can be increased by up&#xD;
      to 100 mg per week to a maximal dose of 400 mg per day. During the treatment period, dose&#xD;
      reductions (because of physical illness or adverse event) are allowed for patients taking at&#xD;
      least 200 mg per day.&#xD;
