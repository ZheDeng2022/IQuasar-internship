  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the safety, specificity, sensitivity and ease of&#xD;
      procedure of two potential diagnostic assays for HSV-1 detection in the cornea. Through the&#xD;
      use of this new diagnostic assay, correct and early intervention would not only reduce&#xD;
      corneal scarring from HSK, but it would also allow the initiation of appropriate treatment&#xD;
      for HSV mimicking keratitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HSV-1 infection of the eye can result in corneal scarring and blindness. Early diagnosis of&#xD;
      this condition and appropriate treatment is of utmost importance. Various ocular surface&#xD;
      conditions can mimic herpetic keratitis in their clinical presentation and can result in&#xD;
      diagnostic confusion. Inappropriate or delayed treatment of herpetic corneal disease results&#xD;
      in increased morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the UK at present clinical presentation is the mainstay of diagnosis. Unfortunately these&#xD;
      cases often present to the most inexperienced clinical staff resulting in variability in&#xD;
      diagnostic acumen. This often results in a delay or inappropriate diagnosis of herpetic&#xD;
      keratitis. Laboratory techniques presently available to aid diagnosis are infrequently used&#xD;
      in clinical practice. There are various reasons for their lack of use. Historically viral&#xD;
      culture techniques were the mainstay of investigation but were slow, requiring weeks to&#xD;
      provide a result. PCR is now replacing culture techniques and is relatively quick, reliable&#xD;
      and sensitive. Many clinicians within the UK are still not fully informed of these advances&#xD;
      and are therefore not utilizing these techniques to supplement clinical diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to investigate the use of topically applied fluorescent antibody against active&#xD;
      replicating HSV-1 in a droplet form and real time PCR detection of the virus. If successful&#xD;
      this should increase the potential diagnostic capabilities of GPs and other less experienced&#xD;
      health care workers. Such tests should reduce variability in diagnosis and the dependency on&#xD;
      experienced ophthalmologists to diagnose the condition.&#xD;

      Strategy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients attending the Ophthalmology departments, who fulfil the criteria as outlined below&#xD;
      in patient recruitment criteria, will be asked for written consent to volunteer for this&#xD;
      study. Tears will be removed and stored in a sterile labelled eppendorf at -70 degrees C&#xD;
      until further analysis. An impression cytology sample will be taken from the inflamed cornea&#xD;
      and stored in viral transport medium and sent to the regional virology laboratory, Belfast&#xD;
      for extraction and storage procedures. Blood samples will be taken and stored appropriately&#xD;
      until the paired 3 month samples are available for antibody testing. Monoclonal antibody will&#xD;
      be applied for the in vivo diagnosis of HSK as outlined below and viewed using an in vivo&#xD;
      confocal microscope. Photographic evidence of the result will be recorded for each patient.&#xD;
      Data for the nested real time PCR analysis and the monoclonal antibody test will be recorded&#xD;
      separately by different individuals for each patient as the study progresses. Patient records&#xD;
      will also be updated with the results of the tear and blood tests as the study progresses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Potential:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over 200 eye patients in the RVH Belfast, over 300 patients in Bedford and over 600 patients&#xD;
      in BMEC in Birmingham are treated each year with topical acyclovir for suspected HSV-1&#xD;
      infection. The number of patients treated within the community by GPs would significantly&#xD;
      increase this number. The vast majority of these patients will have never had any laboratory&#xD;
      confirmation of herpetic infection. The patient throughput through each hospital each year&#xD;
      should enable adequate recruitment to this study over the three year period. This should&#xD;
      ensure that the study is entirely viable from the perspective of patient numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient numbers needed for a viable study&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present we are unable to perform statistical power calculations, as we are not aware of&#xD;
      the sensitivity of either of the two proposed diagnostic assays. Previous work by Kaye SB20.,&#xD;
      et al has suggested a PCR technique with a sensitivity of 82% when used in human corneas). In&#xD;
      contrast, the PCR technique used here should have a much superior sensitivity due to the use&#xD;
      of real time analysis and the nested methodology used. These tests will be compared against&#xD;
      the clinical diagnosis of an experienced consultant ophthalmologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We accept the need for statistical power calculations in order to calculate a recruitment&#xD;
      level needed for a valid study. We will therefore carry out an initial study using all of&#xD;
      these diagnostic assays on 50 patients and the results from this will be used to perform&#xD;
      power calculations using the sample size method for one-sided equivalence of sensitivities&#xD;
      based upon McNemar s test21 to ensure adequate numbers are recruited. In addition, we hope to&#xD;
      over recruit (20% above this required number) to allow for patient dropout from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Recruitment Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients over the age of 16 years in which the cause of keratitis is difficult to diagnose&#xD;
      and in which HSK has to be excluded will be enrolled for this study. Immunosuppressed&#xD;
      patients including patients treated with systemic steroids will be excluded. All patients&#xD;
      will be asked for verbal and written consent. All patients will continue to be followed&#xD;
      according to clinical requirements. In addition to routine assessment additional clinical&#xD;
      categorisation by the attending consultants into those patients thought to (a) have, and (b)&#xD;
      not have, clinical evidence in keeping with herpetic infection will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vivo immunofluorescence diagnostic procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 microlitres of fluorescent-labelled mAB (2mg/ml), (same mAB as used in the previous study&#xD;
      by Sharma A., et al7) in normal saline solution will be applied to the eye. After 20 minutes&#xD;
      unbound antibody will be rinsed away with saline solution. The eye will be viewed with a slit&#xD;
      lamp or an in vivo confocal microscope if available. mAB penetration through the layers of&#xD;
      the cornea will be recorded. In addition, evidence of stromal inflammation will be recorded&#xD;
      and its relationship to specific fluorescence noted. This will indicate the contribution of&#xD;
      active herpetic infection (by specific fluorescence in either epithelium, stroma or both) as&#xD;
      a causative effect rather than an immunological response to latent virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of in vivo results with nested real time PCR technique&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impression cytology will be carried out, prior to the application of the antibody, to confirm&#xD;
      the presence/absence of viral antigens using nested real time PCR analysis. The potential for&#xD;
      amplicon contamination associated with nucleic acid amplification test use is well recognised&#xD;
      and makes mandatory the use of (a) separate, designated work stations and (b) a&#xD;
      uni-directional work-flow from specimen preparation to amplified product analysis; this model&#xD;
      of operation is standard in the regional virology laboratory. All PCR experiments will&#xD;
      therefore be carried out under the supervision of Dr. Hugh O'Neill in the Regional Virology&#xD;
      Laboratory, RVH, Belfast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impression cytology samples will be sent to the laboratory in viral transport medium. Each&#xD;
      specimen will be vortexed for 15 seconds on receipt in the laboratory to resuspend the&#xD;
      cellular content. A volume will be removed for PCR and the remainder will be stored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nested PCR will be undertaken using primers recognising the HSV-1 gpD gene (HSV-1 outer&#xD;
      products will be 221 and 184 base pairs (bp) while the inner products will be 138 and 101 bp&#xD;
      respectively). Hot-start PCR will be performed in a Perkin Elmer GeneAmp 2400 thermal cycler&#xD;
      with 10 μl specimen plus 40 μl of mix and subjected to 35 first round cycles. One microlitre&#xD;
      of product will be transferred to 49μl of second round mix for 25 second round cycles.&#xD;
      Impression cytology samples taken from non-inflamed eyes from recruits with no history of&#xD;
      herpetic eye infection will be used as known negative samples. A positive HSV control and a&#xD;
      distilled water negative control will also be included in each run. First and second round&#xD;
      products will be visualised together on ethidium bromide-stained 2% agarose gels and&#xD;
      photographed (Polaroid). Appropriately sized bands present on second round only, or present&#xD;
      on both first and second rounds, will be recorded as positive and strong positive&#xD;
      respectively. All positive specimens will be re-tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory staff responsible for the PCR test will not be aware of the results from the in&#xD;
      vivo antibody test. Comparison will be made between the sensitivity and specificity of the&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody in vivo assay and the nested real time PCR diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigating the effect of mAB on the ocular surface inflammatory milieu Analysis of the&#xD;
      general cytokine profile will also be assessed by monitoring the cytokine profile of tears at&#xD;
      two different time points: prior to monoclonal antibody treatment and again 30 minutes after&#xD;
      the application of the antibody. Cytokine profile of tears will be analysed using proteomics&#xD;
      with a protein biochip (RANDOX Labs. Ltd.) capable of simultaneous quantitative detection of&#xD;
      an array of pro- and anti- inflammatory cytokines. Tear samples from patients suspected of&#xD;
      active herpetic infection but who have not received antibody will serve as controls. Such&#xD;
      analysis will allow statements to be made regarding the potential inflammatory/immunological&#xD;
      reaction to the monoclonal antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigating a potential systemic immunological reaction the mouse mAB Ten millilitres of&#xD;
      clotted blood will be taken prior to the application of the monoclonal antibody to test for&#xD;
      the presence of pre-existing antibody. In addition, at the 3 month check up a further 10&#xD;
      millilitres of blood will be taken and analysed again for antibodies which may have formed in&#xD;
      the three month interface after the application of the monoclonal to the cornea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The avascular cornea is thought to be an immunologically privileged site, making the&#xD;
      potential of an immune response to the antibody less likely.&#xD;
