      The purpose of this study is to identify genes associated with certain risk factors for&#xD;
      atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) and its consequences, such as development of&#xD;
      coronary artery disease, heart attack, other blood vessel disease and stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People enrolled in the Framingham Heart Study in Framingham, Massachusetts, are eligible to&#xD;
      participate in this study. They will undergo a medical history, including review of their&#xD;
      medical records and a family history; evaluation of memory and mood; breathing test and&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (EKG); blood and urine tests, including blood sample collection for DNA&#xD;
      (genetic) testing; evaluation of gait (walking), balance and hand grip strength; and hearing&#xD;
      test. They will also fill out questionnaires on their eating habits and general health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any patients who may suffer a stroke during the study will be examined during their&#xD;
      hospitalization and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after the stroke. This examination includes a&#xD;
      neurological evaluation, assessment of ability to perform daily living tasks and, possibly,&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, a test that uses a strong magnetic field and&#xD;
      radio waves to produce pictures of the brain.&#xD;

      We are studying the relationship between genetic variants of the human immune system and&#xD;
      atherosclerosis through a collaboration with the Framingham Heart Study. Since&#xD;
      atherosclerosis is a disease of chronic inflammation of the arterial vessel wall, genetic&#xD;
      variants in molecules that are responsible for the migration of leukocytes are likely to&#xD;
      explain some of the genetic diversity in the rate of heart disease and strokes. Therefore we&#xD;
      are conducting a molecular epidemiology study of the genetics of atherosclerosis using&#xD;
      materials and clinical data already collected by the Framingham Heart Study. The Heart Study&#xD;
      is a prospective epidemiological study of the natural history of heart disease and stroke&#xD;
      that has involved individuals residing in Framingham, Massachusetts since the 1950s. We will&#xD;
      compare risks of individuals with particular genotypes for developing atherosclerosis and its&#xD;
      sequelae, coronary artery disease, heart attack, peripheral vascular disease, and stroke. If&#xD;
      correlations of genotype with risk of atherosclerosis can be found, then this will facilitate&#xD;
      new treatments of this disease based on interference with particular components of the human&#xD;
      immune system.&#xD;
