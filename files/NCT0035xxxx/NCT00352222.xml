      To obtain additional data on safety and efficacy of the Express stent implantation in the&#xD;
      treatment of stenosed or occlusive atherosclerotic disease (de novo or restenotic lesions) in&#xD;
      the iliac arteries (common or external).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to provide additional data on the safety and efficacy of the&#xD;
      Express™ Vascular LD stent, particularly with regard to the long-term patency in iliac&#xD;
      arteries. The study would provide data on angiographic endpoints and clinical outcomes at 30&#xD;
      days, 6 months, and at 12 and 24 months post implantation in atherosclerotic lesions in iliac&#xD;
      arteries. The data obtained in this study with the use of the Express™ Vascular LD stent was&#xD;
      compared with historical data obtained from the use of the Palmaz balloon-expandable stent.&#xD;
      The Palmaz balloon expandable stent has been chosen as the control device because it is&#xD;
      currently the only FDA-approved balloon-expandable stent for use in the percutaneous&#xD;
      treatment of atherosclerotic disease in iliac arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Palmaz balloon-expandable stent is no longer commercialized in Europe. Therefore a&#xD;
      randomized study with the Palmaz balloon-expandable stent was not feasible. In addition,&#xD;
      there are no ongoing or published randomized trials describing performance of a newer version&#xD;
      of the Palmaz stent in iliac atherosclerotic lesions. In order to adequately compare the&#xD;
      efficacy data of the ExpressTM Vascular LD stent with the efficacy data of the Palmaz&#xD;
      balloon-expandable stent, the same efficacy parameter as in the publication on the Palmaz&#xD;
      balloon-expandable stent was measured in this study: % mean loss of the luminal diameter at 6&#xD;
      months post-procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings of the longer-term Follow-Up assessments at 12 and 24 months will be presented&#xD;
      as the results from these assessments become available.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  chronic symptomatic atherosclerotic disease in the iliac arteries (Fontaine Class IIa,&#xD;
             IIb, and III)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  atherosclerotic de novo or restenotic lesions in the common and/or external iliac&#xD;
             artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  baseline diameter stenosis of &gt; or = 50%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  reference vessel diameter &gt; or = 5mm and &lt; or = 10mm&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  at least one sufficient ipsilateral infrapopliteal run-off&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  length of diseased segment(s) &lt; or = 10cm and can be treated with maximally two&#xD;
             overlapping Express Vascular LD Stents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  multiple target lesions of the iliac arteries in the same patient can be included&#xD;
             provided if each target lesion is compliant with the antiographic inclusion criteria&#xD;
             and non-compliant with any of the antiographic exclusion criteria, target lesions are&#xD;
             not located in the same target axis, and all target lesions can be treated during the&#xD;
             same procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
