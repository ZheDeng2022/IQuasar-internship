      This study will examine blood cells and other tissue samples from people with uveitis (eye&#xD;
      inflammation) to try to gain a better understanding of this condition. It will look at 1) the&#xD;
      differences in cells when uveitis is active and when it is under control; 2) the genes that&#xD;
      control the functions of these cells during different stages of the condition; and 3) the&#xD;
      proteins the cells make at these different stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 6 years of age or older with an eye inflammation of at least 8 weeks' duration may&#xD;
      be eligible for this study. They must currently be enrolled in another NEI protocol for&#xD;
      evaluation or treatment of uveitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will provide blood and possibly eye tissue samples as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples: Blood samples will be drawn, probably from an arm vein, during periods when&#xD;
      the inflammation is bad and when it is quiet. No more than 60 mL (about 4 tablespoons) will&#xD;
      be drawn at any visit, and no more than eight samples will be collected in 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue samples: For patients who require eye surgery, a sample of tissue or fluid that is&#xD;
      removed as a routine part of surgery may be provided to investigators in this study for&#xD;
      research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be collected during patients' visits scheduled as part of their other protocol.&#xD;
      The samples will be labeled with a special code number to preserve the patient's identity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Ocular inflammatory diseases, including uveitis, cause significant visual loss. Previous&#xD;
      non-human investigations have identified several cell types, receptor systems and metabolic&#xD;
      intermediates that have led to treatment approaches for human patients. However, information&#xD;
      on the human genetic expression of these steps in defined inflammatory disease states is&#xD;
      lacking. This non-intervention study proposes to obtain peripheral blood and tissue specimens&#xD;
      from patients enrolled in other intramural trials for ocular inflammatory diseases and to&#xD;
      apply contemporary cDNA microarray technologies for the analysis of differential gene&#xD;
      expression. Test results will not be reported to participants or used for diagnostic or&#xD;
      therapeutic purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study's primary objective is to identify unique gene expression profiles as well as&#xD;
      disease relevant genes for patients with ocular inflammatory disease at defined clinical&#xD;
      stages using cDNA microarray analysis. This will help provide further insight to understand&#xD;
      the pathological mechanisms and potential targets for treatment. Some 3,000-5,000 genes will&#xD;
      be examined starting with a selected set associated with interleukin (IL) proteins and their&#xD;
      receptors, and with tumor necrosis factors (TNF). Purified peripheral blood mononuclear cells&#xD;
      (or whole blood lysates using RNA isolation procedures) will be used to isolate total RNA&#xD;
      from these samples. Samples will be taken during periods of active or recurring inflammatory&#xD;
      disease and again during periods of quiescence after treatment. The microarray tools and&#xD;
      methods for genetic analysis are now available both at NEI and the collaborating NIA&#xD;
      laboratories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary objective is to analyze the circulating protein profiles in serum or other&#xD;
      available tissue or fluid specimens from patients with ocular inflammatory disease at the&#xD;
      same time points as described above. These samples will be analyzed using 2-dimensional&#xD;
      SDS-PAGE for profiling proteomic differences in patients at defined clinical stages. In-gel&#xD;
      digestion and subsequent sequence analysis by mass spectroscopy will be performed if&#xD;
      differentially expressed protein(s) of interest are to be identified. Other methods such as&#xD;
      flow cytometry analysis and proliferation assays using purified PBMCs will be used to examine&#xD;
      expression status of cell surface markers of interest (e.g., CD25) as well as responses to&#xD;
      antigen and mitogens at the peak and trough serum concentrations of daclizumab therapy.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Participant is 6 or more years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Participant has a diagnosis of an ocular inflammatory disease of at least eight&#xD;
                  weeks' duration prior to enrollment, requiring medical treatment to control the&#xD;
                  ocular inflammation. This treatment must require using a corticosteroid (e.g.,&#xD;
                  prednisone or equivalent) or an investigational treatment, or any combination of&#xD;
                  two or more anti-inflammatory treatments, including for example prednisone,&#xD;
                  cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil,&#xD;
                  methotrexate, etc. Participants are anticipated to have, but are not restricted&#xD;
                  to, the following conditions: scleritis, intermediate or posterior uveitis,&#xD;
                  intermediate uveitis of the pars planitis subtype, sarcoidosis, the&#xD;
                  Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome, Behcet's disease, juvenile rheumatoid&#xD;
                  arthritis (JRA), retinal vasculitis or sympathetic ophthalmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Participant is currently enrolled in another NEI protocol for one of the above&#xD;
                  (or related) conditions that requires periodic visits to NIH for treatment and/or&#xD;
                  evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Participant is able to understand and sign an informed consent (or applicable&#xD;
                  assent) and if the participant is younger than the age 18 at enrollment, has a&#xD;
                  parent or legal guardian who is able to understand and sign a consent form on&#xD;
                  their behalf.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participant is under the age of 6 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participant has inadequate vascular access to obtain a routine venous peripheral whole&#xD;
             blood specimen totaling up to 50 mL at a single visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participants has an inadequate peripheral leukocyte count such that it would be&#xD;
             unlikely to provide an adequate RNA sample. For this purpose, a total leukocyte count&#xD;
             below 3 x 10(9)/L will exclude a participant at enrollment. Unless there is a&#xD;
             recognized medical condition likely to reduce leukocyte counts, blood counts from a&#xD;
             prior visit up to 5 weeks earlier may be used to determine eligibility for a first or&#xD;
             subsequent sample collection. (A participant who initially enrolls with an adequate&#xD;
             leukocyte count may remain enrolled if counts subsequently fall below the limit, but&#xD;
             will not have blood samples drawn for this protocol until the leukocyte count recovers&#xD;
             above the limit).&#xD;
