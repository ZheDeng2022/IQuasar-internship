  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, breast cancer is the most common cancer occurring in women (excluding&#xD;
      cancers of the skin) and the second most common cause of death from cancer in women (after&#xD;
      lung cancer). Approximately 182,800 new cases per year occur in the United States, causing&#xD;
      40,800 death cases per year. Breast cancer is the leading cause of death in women aged 44-50&#xD;
      years. The 5-year survival rate is 60% overall but is greater than 80% for early disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If diagnosed at an early stage, breast cancer has an encouraging cure rate: up to 97% of&#xD;
      women diagnosed with localized breast cancer will survive five years after their diagnosis.&#xD;
      Even if the cancer is found at a more advanced stage, new therapies have enabled many people&#xD;
      with breast cancer to experience the same quality of life as before their diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast ultrasound (US) is an extremely useful modality in the diagnosis of breast disease in&#xD;
      the symptomatic clinic. It is routinely used as an adjunct to x-ray mammography and clinical&#xD;
      examination and, with younger patients it may be the sole imaging modality. It has&#xD;
      well-established value in differentiating between malignant and benign solid lesions in some&#xD;
      cases, however, it cannot replace fine needle aspiration and core biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional breast US scanning is highly operator- dependent, requiring skillful probe&#xD;
      manipulation and the mental ability to envisage 3-D tissue structure. Acquiring 3-D US data&#xD;
      sets may be advantageous, making it easier to see and interpret 3-D structures, boundaries&#xD;
      and interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBUS™, Circular Breast Ultrasound Scanner is indicated to improve significantly breast images&#xD;
      obtained by ultrasound systems. The CBUS™ system automatically acquires a complete breast&#xD;
      image and constructs a high quality 3D image of the scanned breast. These images provide&#xD;
      diagnostic information of the complete volume of breast tissue including blood flow in a&#xD;
      single ultrasonic 3D image.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this clinical study, the CBUS™ Circular Breast Ultrasound Scanner will be used to&#xD;
      automatically image the complete breast and provides a high quality 3D image of the scanned&#xD;
      breast.&#xD;
