    <textblock>
      This study will identify genes and proteins in the blood of patients with atherosclerosis and&#xD;
      in that of normal volunteers. The findings will be compared to determine the influence of&#xD;
      these substances on the development of atherosclerosis a narrowing and hardening of blood&#xD;
      vessel walls by deposits of fatty substances. Blood vessel blockage caused by atherosclerosis&#xD;
      can impede blood flow and cause stroke, heart attack and poor limb circulation. The&#xD;
      information from this study may lead to better ways to detect, prevent and treat these&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers and patients scheduled for carotid endarterectomy at Suburban Hospital in&#xD;
      Bethesda, Maryland, are eligible for this study. Carotid endarterectomy is a surgical&#xD;
      procedure in which the inner layer of the carotid artery (neck artery supplying blood to the&#xD;
      brain) is scraped away to open the blocked vessel. Participants will undergo the following&#xD;
      tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sample: Collection of about 32 cc (8 tablespoons) of blood for genetic and protein&#xD;
           analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tissue sample: Collection of a piece of diseased blood vessel discarded from the&#xD;
           endarterectomy procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of records: Review of medical records for information about past illnesses,&#xD;
           medications, tests, and so forth, if needed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal Volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples: Collection of about 32 cc (8 tablespoons) of blood for genetic and&#xD;
           protein analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Carotid artery ultrasound: Ultrasound imaging of the neck arteries for detection of any&#xD;
           blockage&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram: Recording of the electrical activity of the heart to detect any&#xD;
           abnormalities in heart rhythm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Echocardiogram: Ultrasound examination to detect possible abnormalities of the heart&#xD;
           muscle&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac stress test: Treadmill stress test to detect possible heart vessel blockage (for&#xD;
           subjects who have not had a cardiac stress test in the past year)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of records: Review of medical records for information about past illnesses,&#xD;
           medications, tests, and so forth, if needed&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Significant progress has been made in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis, but it&#xD;
      continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in our society. The problem will&#xD;
      become even more significant as an increasing proportion of the population ages. The goal of&#xD;
      the proposed project is to advance our understanding of the genetic mechanisms of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis. We propose to identify genes selectively expressed in peripheral monocytes&#xD;
      of patients with atherosclerosis and in macrophages and endothelial cells of atherosclerotic&#xD;
      plaques. We will examine gene expression profiles in purified subpopulations of cells using&#xD;
      Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) that requires only minute amounts of RNA, enabling&#xD;
      the study of small homogeneous populations of cells. This sequence-based high-throughput gene&#xD;
      expression profiling technique has the advantage of not requiring prior knowledge of the&#xD;
      expressed gene sequences, allowing the discovery of new genes. With the completion of the&#xD;
      human genome sequence, the SAGE technique is an ideal tool for comprehensively characterizing&#xD;
      the transcriptomes of the important cells involved in atherosclerosis. This proposal is an&#xD;
      exploratory study to find candidates, both known and unknown genes, which will be used for&#xD;
      more extensive and statistically powered projects in the future. The insights obtained will&#xD;
      be used for elucidating the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and for developing new simple,&#xD;
      sensitive and specific tests for early disease diagnosis. In addition, the new insights&#xD;
      obtained may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for disease prevention&#xD;
      and treatment.&#xD;
