  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Timely diagnosis of intraepithelial neoplasias (premalignant condition)is of crucial&#xD;
      importance for clinical management of ulcerative colitis. We assessed the value of combined&#xD;
      chromoscopy and endomicroscopy for diagnosis of intraepithelial neoplasias in a randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endomicroscopy is a new device which enables microscopy of the mucosal layer during ongoing&#xD;
      colonoscopy. Chromoscopy means topical staining of mucosal surface to unmask areas of&#xD;
      interest, which are subsequently examined with the endomicroscopic system.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an immune cell-mediated inflammatory bowel disease characterized&#xD;
      by mucosal ulcerations, rectal bleeding, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Patients with long&#xD;
      standing UC face an increased risk for development of colitis associated colorectal cancer.&#xD;
      Factors associated with increased risk for cancer development include the duration of the&#xD;
      disease, extensive colonic involvement (pancolitis, backwash ileitis), primary sclerosing&#xD;
      cholangitis and severe chronic active inflammation. Based on these observations, colonoscopic&#xD;
      surveillance in patients with long-standing UC is highly recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of surveillance colonoscopy in UC is to detect neoplasia at a surgically&#xD;
      curative and preferably pre-invasive stage. However, in contrast to sporadic colorectal&#xD;
      cancer, the growing pattern of neoplastic tissue in UC is often flat and multifocal.&#xD;
      Therefore, significant lesions during conventional colonoscopy in UC are frequently&#xD;
      overlooked. Chromoscopy with topically applied dyes such as methylene blue or indigo carmine&#xD;
      facilitates the endoscopic detection of flat, circumscribed colitis associated neoplastic&#xD;
      changes in UC. In fact, five controlled studies showed that the diagnostic yield for the&#xD;
      detection of intraepithelial neoplasia (IN) using chromoscopy is higher as compared to&#xD;
      conventional colonoscopy with random biopsies. Based on the above studies, chromoscopy has&#xD;
      recently been considered for incorporation into US guidelines for surveillance of patients&#xD;
      with long-standing UC. However, although this technique does allow identification of mucosal&#xD;
      lesions, it is not suitable for accurate endoscopic diagnosis of intraepithelial neoplasias&#xD;
      in UC due to the lack of cellular resolution and subsurface imaging. For endoscopy, novel&#xD;
      techniques allowing accurate diagnoses during ongoing examination are highly desirable and&#xD;
      may allow appropriate and immediate therapeutic manoeuvres (e.g. resection versus biopsy).&#xD;
      Recently, a miniaturized confocal microscope has been developed integrated in the distal tip&#xD;
      of a conventional colonoscope . This new diagnostic technology for gastrointestinal&#xD;
      endoscopy, denoted confocal endomicroscopy, enables histological evaluation of the mucosal&#xD;
      layer during ongoing colonoscopy. Furthermore, in patients screened for sporadic colorectal&#xD;
      cancer, surface and subsurface analysis at cellular and subcellular resolution can be used to&#xD;
      predict intraepithelial neoplasias (INs) with high accuracy. However, due to the time&#xD;
      required for examination of large surface areas, this technique is not suitable for screening&#xD;
      of the entire colonic surface in UC to detect neoplasias in flat mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, we employ chromoscopy to identify potential neoplastic lesions and&#xD;
      combine this for the first time with endomicroscopy for the endoscopic diagnosis of colitis&#xD;
      associated intraepithelial neoplasias in UC. Using such chromoscopy guided endomicroscopy we&#xD;
      will ecaluate whether the diagnostic yield diagnosing IN can be significantly increased.&#xD;
