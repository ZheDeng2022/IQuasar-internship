  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nightly administration of 8 mg of a unique sublingual (under the tongue) formulation of&#xD;
      tizanidine, a known anti-spasticity medication, has been shown in a previous study to improve&#xD;
      next-day spasticity, about 12 hours following dosing in 20 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.&#xD;
      This improvement was statistically significant when compared to oral tizanidine dosing. The&#xD;
      current study is being undertaken to see if increasing the dose to 12 mg once nightly will&#xD;
      result in an even greater improvement, with a longer effect, i.e., next day improvement in&#xD;
      spasticity both in the morning as well as in the late afternoon.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sublingual tizanidine, a novel test formulation of the known effective antispasticity agent,&#xD;
      has been shown to have a unique pharmacokinetic profile [(i.e., nearly twice the&#xD;
      bioavailability/AUC), but with little or no increase in peak plasma levels (Cmax) as compared&#xD;
      to oral tizanidine (Zanaflex)]. When administered nightly to 20 MS patients, at a dose of 8&#xD;
      mg, it was shown to improve next-day spasticity (statistically significant improvement in&#xD;
      Ashworth scores) about 12 hours post-dosing), improvement in nighttime (first quartile) sleep&#xD;
      efficiency (as demonstrated by actigraphic measurement), and no increase in daytime&#xD;
      somnolence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current study is being undertaken to evaluate if increased dosing (12 mg once nightly) of&#xD;
      sublingual tizanidine (vs. oral) will show a concomitant increase in clinical effect, i.e.,&#xD;
      longer improvement, with next-day spasticity score improvement both in AM (as previously) as&#xD;
      well as at PM (late afternoon) evaluation, with no increase in daytime somnolence.&#xD;
