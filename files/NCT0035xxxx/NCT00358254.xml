      The objective of this study is to assess the performance of a noninvasive device for the&#xD;
      early screening of Diabetes Mellitus.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 18 million people have Type II diabetes, and of these, an estimated thirty-five&#xD;
      percent are unaware of their condition. This translates to roughly 6.3 million undiagnosed&#xD;
      cases worldwide in 2002. Many diagnoses are made years after the onset of the disease. This&#xD;
      allows progression of the vascular lesions that arise during the time of uncontrolled glucose&#xD;
      levels. As a result, microvascular retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy are on the rise,&#xD;
      as well as macrovascular complications such as: coronary heart disease, and cerebral vascular&#xD;
      accidents. The prevalence and trends of diabetes underscore the need for effective and&#xD;
      widespread screening. Our fluorescence based system under development will noninvasively&#xD;
      measure skin glycation end products that are known to be strongly correlated with diabetes&#xD;
      status and complications. Since the test would be painless and require no patient fasting,&#xD;
      significant obstacles to screening compliance would be mitigated. The system offers hope for&#xD;
      a screening test that is more sensitive and specific than the invasive tests currently used&#xD;
      for diabetes screening (Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) and the Fasting Plasma Glucose&#xD;
      (FPG) test).&#xD;
