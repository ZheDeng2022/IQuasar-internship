  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dr. Eleanor Drey in the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences UCSF&#xD;
      is conducting a study to examine the personal and economic impact of continuous use of ORTHO&#xD;
      EVRA, the contraceptive patch, on menstrual related symptoms for women who report having&#xD;
      severe menstrual related symptoms.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      30 adult women, 18-40 years of age, will be recruited to participate in a six month study.&#xD;
      The focus of recruitment will be on women with menstrual-related symptoms who are currently&#xD;
      working in physically demanding, low autonomous service jobs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The approximate first two months of women's participation will be spent documenting baseline&#xD;
      information about their health and well-being, work patterns and performance, and the&#xD;
      economic impact of their menstruation. Subjects will then initiate two, two month intervals&#xD;
      of continuous use of ORTHO EVRA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over this four month treatment period, subjects will document their health and well-being,&#xD;
      work patterns and performance, and the economic impact of their menstruation while being&#xD;
      treated with ORTHO EVRA. This will allow us to compare subjects' experiences pre- and&#xD;
      post-treatment. The study's instruments will focus on eliciting information on the personal&#xD;
      and economic costs of menstruation such as measuring time missed from work, changes in&#xD;
      productivity and work satisfaction, and impact on quality of life.&#xD;
