    <textblock>
      Eligible overweight and obese persons will be randomized to one of three controlled groups: 1&#xD;
      group of participants is treated by health education for life style intervention only. The&#xD;
      other 2 groups will be included in a dietary program with an individually dosed food&#xD;
      supplement (Almased®) for an initial weight reduction for a period of 6 weeks. The following&#xD;
      18 weeks represent the most important phase of weight loss and attitude, the participants&#xD;
      take part in 2 different interventions according to their randomization. One group will&#xD;
      continue the dietary program, one group will try to achieve and maintain weight reduction by&#xD;
      continuing the initial dietary program together with an additional physical activity program.&#xD;
      For all intervention groups the following 6 months aim at a further stabilization of weight&#xD;
      and attitude, now without defined guidelines of intervention but with the intention to&#xD;
      continue the so far practiced change in life style. All participants will be supplied with&#xD;
      adequate information and material concerning the desired change in life style.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Obese and adipose participants are randomized to three intervention groups. During the first&#xD;
      six weeks of the program, the subjects assigned to the substitutional diet group (SD-G) were&#xD;
      instructed to replace two daily meals with a commercially available soy-joghurt-honey&#xD;
      preparation (Almased®). During the following 18 weeks, only one daily meal was replaced by&#xD;
      the preparation. The dietary intake of fat during this second phase was not to exceed 60g per&#xD;
      day. The first 6-week diet contained about 1000 kcal per day for women and 1200 kcal for men,&#xD;
      and then, in the following weeks, aimed at a maximum of 1500 kcal for women and 1700 kcal for&#xD;
      men. In addition, a second group of subjects were encouraged to additionally attend a&#xD;
      60-minute physical activity endurance program twice weekly. Otherwise, they were to follow&#xD;
      the same rules as the substitutional diet group (SD/PA-G).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lifestyle education group (LE-G) attended, after enrolment, three teaching sessions&#xD;
      bi-monthly and had individual consultations during weeks 6, 24 and 48. All sessions were held&#xD;
      by experts in nutritional counselling. Subjects received a diet-overview handout, in&#xD;
      accordance with the &quot;German Society of Nutrition&quot; and the &quot;German Society of Sports Medicine&#xD;
      and Prevention&quot;. Prescribed was a moderate-fat, nutrient-balanced reduction diet consisting&#xD;
      of 1200 to 1500 kcal per day for women and 1500 to 1800 kcal per day for men, with&#xD;
      approximately 60 percent of the calories coming from carbohydrates, 25 percent from fat, and&#xD;
      15 percent from protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected at enrolment and after 6, 24 and 48 weeks were body weight, waist and&#xD;
      abdominal circumference, self-reported medical history, blood pressure, glucose, insulin,&#xD;
      serum lipids and inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, IL-6). For measurement of body&#xD;
      composition, the technique of air displacement plethysmography was used (Bod Pod). Dietary&#xD;
      compliance was estimated by 24-hour recalls of dietary consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints: Body weight loss of 5% and 10 %; Reduction of body fat; Change of muscle mass&#xD;
