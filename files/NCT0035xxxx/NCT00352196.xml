      This study will be an open-label, 12-week trial of risperidone in subjects with Asperger's&#xD;
      Disorder, according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM-IV)&#xD;
      Criteria. The study has two arms, one involving pre- and post-treatment MRS studies, and one&#xD;
      without MRS. The MRS arm will study 18-20 subjects ages 6 and above, with a target of 14&#xD;
      completing patients. For both arms, we plan to a enroll at total of 30 patients to achieve&#xD;
      completion for 24 patients. The non-MRS arm of the study will include subjects 6-18 years of&#xD;
      age, the bulk of which have completed the study as of the writing of this updated revision.&#xD;
      Our hypotheses are that treatment of Asperger's patients with a low dose of risperidone will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. decrease ratios of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), creatine, phosphocreatine (Cr + PCr), and&#xD;
           choline in the prefrontal lobe, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. decrease the severity of negative symptoms and overall improve social behavior, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. that the two will be correlated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this trial are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Further assess and investigate the utility of risperidone in the treatment Asperger's&#xD;
           disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the efficacy of risperidone in normalizing increased frontal lobe metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the efficacy of risperidone in normalizing symptoms in Asperger's disorder&#xD;
           patients using standardized rating scales to assess the impact on negative symptoms and&#xD;
           on social interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether risperidone's effect on clinical improvement of Asperger's disorder,&#xD;
           i.e., negative symptoms, is correlated with normalization of frontal lobe metabolites&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Accrue safety and tolerability data on risperidone for this population of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This information could potentially be used to provide pilot data for a double blind trial&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be an open-label, 12-week trial of risperidone in subjects with Asperger's&#xD;
      Disorder, according to DSM-IV Criteria. The study has two arms, one involving pre- and&#xD;
      post-treatment MRS studies, and one without MRS. The MRS arm will study 18-20 subjects ages 6&#xD;
      and above, with a target of 14 completing patients. For both arms, we plan to a enroll at&#xD;
      total of 30 patients to achieve completion for 24 patients. The non-MRS arm of the study will&#xD;
      include subjects 6-18 years of age, the bulk of which have completed the study as of the&#xD;
      writing of this updated revision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will first undergo a screening visit during which safety and diagnostic assessments&#xD;
      are completed, and a minimum of 3 days will be allowed to evaluate the screening results.&#xD;
      Then, the subjects will complete one or two practice sessions to provide training to achieve&#xD;
      the necessary stillness for a duration that is sufficient to complete a MRS session. Upon&#xD;
      completion of successful practice sessions, subjects will then be scheduled for a MRS visit.&#xD;
      Once the MRS is successfully completed, subjects will be assigned to receive risperidone 0.25&#xD;
      mg at their baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response to risperidone will be measured at weeks 3, 6, 9, and 12 by the Scale for Assessment&#xD;
      of Negative Symptoms (SANS). Additional secondary outcome measures are shown below (figure&#xD;
      1). A post-treatment MRS will be conducted after the Week 12 or early termination visit.&#xD;
      Subjects will be given adequate medication supply to cover through the day of the final MRS&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Medication. Because Asperger's Disorder is diagnosed in childhood and is considered a&#xD;
      childhood disease, our previous phase of the study focused on subjects ages 6 - 18. Published&#xD;
      dosages of risperidone used in child, adolescent, and adult studies ranges from 0.25 to 11 mg&#xD;
      per day. Most studies in children and adolescents begin with a starting dose of 0.25 mg bid,&#xD;
      which is also appropriate for adults, and will be the starting dose planned for this study.&#xD;
      The study progresses from a fixed to a titrated dose paradigm. After Week 6, dose will be&#xD;
      increased (based on response and tolerability), ranging from one to two tablets twice daily&#xD;
      (either 1 or 2 mg of risperidone daily). Again at Week 9, dose will be increased (based on&#xD;
      response and tolerability), ranging from 1 mg to 4 mg per day of risperidone, one to four&#xD;
      tablets twice a day of risperidone. Patients who have any trouble tolerating the starting&#xD;
      dose may have their dose reduced to 0.25 mg per day and continue in the study. Patients who&#xD;
      cannot tolerate the 0.25 mg dosage would discontinue the study in order to receive&#xD;
      alternative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schedule of Events and Observations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit: A Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnosis (SCID) in conjunction with&#xD;
      DSM-IV criteria and a psychiatric history, will allow the study physicians to establish and&#xD;
      confirm a diagnosis of Asperger's disorder. Medical history, vital signs, clinical labs&#xD;
      {chemistry, complete blood count (CBC), thyroid function, urinalysis, urine drug screen, and&#xD;
      blood pregnancy test (fecund females only)}, a physical exam, and an EKG will be performed to&#xD;
      determine patient safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Draws: Additional lab samples will be collected at both screening and end of study to&#xD;
      explore 1) the effects of diet on treatment outcomes with risperidone, and 2) effects of&#xD;
      risperidone treatment on levels of Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Nerve Growth&#xD;
      Factor (NGF). The additional blood will amount to an approximate total of 8 tablespoons of&#xD;
      blood collected during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRS Visits and Practice Sessions: Subjects enrolling in the MRS arm, will be scheduled for a&#xD;
      pretreatment MRS which will take place after the screening visit but before the baseline&#xD;
      visit and prior to starting risperidone. Subjects will also have a post-treatment MRS within&#xD;
      7 days of their week 12 visit or at study termination. Patients will be supplied with enough&#xD;
      medication to continue treatment until the MRS measures are complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects may be required, based on the investigator's discretion, to complete one or two&#xD;
      sessions during the screening period for Practice Sessions for MRS studies to better prepare&#xD;
      subjects for the level of stillness needed for MRS studies. The practice sessions will last&#xD;
      approximately one hour and will be performed at the Medical College of Georgia (MCG) Office&#xD;
      of Clinical Investigative Services, located at 1521 Pope Ave, Suite FF-100. Practice Sessions&#xD;
      may also be performed at the MRI suite at MCG to allow the subject to see or lie in the MRI&#xD;
      machine, depending on availability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for practice sessions: We have learned that these sessions may be necessary to help&#xD;
      subjects achieve the stillness required for MRS. During the sessions, subjects will be&#xD;
      trained to remain still while lying on a padded stretcher, using behavioral and relaxation&#xD;
      training techniques performed by a qualified investigator. Other efforts will be made to&#xD;
      simulate the MRS environment that may include playing recorded sounds of a MRI machine and&#xD;
      simulation of the padded head supports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In most cases the Practice Sessions, would be all done prior to the MRS visit, but in some&#xD;
      cases of a failed MRS visit, the investigator may choose to schedule another practice session&#xD;
      prior to re-trying the MRS visit. The practice session will supplement the standard efforts&#xD;
      used to support patients' compliance during MRI procedures. For example, part of the&#xD;
      hospital's usual care during MRI studies includes the option of having the patient wear video&#xD;
      goggles and headphones. Subjects in our study may view a calming video of neutral content to&#xD;
      aid in problems affecting stillness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioral reinforcement and subject payments during practice sessions. Part of the payment&#xD;
      for practice sessions will be used as a behavioral reinforcement plan, and this will be in&#xD;
      addition to the $20 payment for clinic visits, reimbursement for travel over 25 miles one-way&#xD;
      @ .28/mile, and $50 for the MRS visit (paid regardless of success or failure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The additional subject payment in the practice session will be used as incentive and&#xD;
      behavioral reinforcement for achieving stillness. Specifically, subjects will receive a token&#xD;
      (such as a poker chip or printed paper token) worth $5.00 for each 5-minute period they&#xD;
      remain still. If a subject's head moves during a period, they will be told they have to begin&#xD;
      a new period. The achievement of stillness will be determined by the investigator at the&#xD;
      time, taking into account the actual observed stillness and the need to encourage and reward&#xD;
      the subjects' efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The actual stillness practice will last up to 40 minutes, and the subject will receive a&#xD;
      token for each 5 minute period they remain still, for up to 8 periods. The total additional&#xD;
      payment for behavioral reinforcement will range from $5.00 to $40.00, to be paid in the same&#xD;
      way as other subject payments. In the case of adolescent subjects, parents will be encouraged&#xD;
      to consider the additional practice session payments to go to the child as a reward for the&#xD;
      child's efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Visit: Subjects will be scheduled for baseline procedures when lab results and MRS&#xD;
      values are reviewed and approved by the study physician, in most cases expected to be a&#xD;
      period of 7 days. This visit will consist of medical-psychiatric interviews and&#xD;
      neurocognitive testing. A urine pregnancy test (done previously at screening) may be repeated&#xD;
      at baseline based on the judgement of the investigator.&#xD;
