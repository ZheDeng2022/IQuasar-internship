  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to determine the effects of growth hormone and an insulin&#xD;
      sensitizer drug in pre-diabetic adults with excessive amounts of abdominal fat. Participants&#xD;
      received a combination of two drugs: (1) recombinant human growth hormone (or its placebo)&#xD;
      and (2) pioglitazone (or its placebo). We measured the abdominal fat content and blood sugar&#xD;
      levels of participants before and after 40 weeks of treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment with recombinant human growth hormone (GH) has been shown to reduce visceral&#xD;
      adipose tissue (VAT) and improve insulin sensitivity in normoglycemic adults, but glucose&#xD;
      levels may rise transiently. Pioglitazone, a thiazolidinedione (TZD) drug, counters the&#xD;
      short-term diabetogenic effect of GH in rodents, but combined use of these drugs has not been&#xD;
      evaluated in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of GH and a TZD, alone and in&#xD;
      combination, on glucose metabolism, visceral adiposity and insulin sensitivity in abdominally&#xD;
      obese adults with impaired glucose tolerance. The hypothesis that combined treatment&#xD;
      attenuates GH-induced increases in glucose concentrations, reduces VAT, and improves insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity over time was tested. Sixty-two adults received GH and pioglitazone for 40 weeks&#xD;
      in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.&#xD;
