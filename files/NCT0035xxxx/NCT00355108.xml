      Scientific Objectives Primary objective : Demonstrate that oral intake of tranexamic acid&#xD;
      significantly reduces the risk of epistaxis occurrence, estimated by the average monthly&#xD;
      duration of episodes of epistaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Document the benefit of tranexamic acid on the amount of haemoglobine and quality of&#xD;
           life of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify scalable and genetic factors of response to the treatment by tranexamic acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe compliance and tolerance of the treatment. Method Experimental Design We&#xD;
           suggest the realisation of a randomised comparative clinical trial versus placebo, with&#xD;
           a crossover of random alternated periods of three months over a total of six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population 213 affected patients, displaying sufficiently invalidating epistaxis to&#xD;
      require a basal treatment, will be recruited and followed every 3 months. Recruitment will&#xD;
      lean on teams who are part of the national French network in close collaboration with the&#xD;
      reference centre for the Rendu-Osler disorder, appointed to Lyon on the 19th of November&#xD;
      2004. Follow up of the study will be carried out by the Clinical Investigational Centre of&#xD;
      the related towns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures The main criterion of efficacy is the average duration of epistaxis, the&#xD;
      secondary criterion of efficacy is the average number of epistaxis measured per month.&#xD;
      Tolerance will be analysed according to the occurrence of venal or arterial thrombosis and&#xD;
      allergic accidents. Venal thrombosis will systematically be sought by an inferior limbs&#xD;
      echodoppler. Response markers will be sought through modelisation incorporating&#xD;
      environmental, phenotypic and genetic factors.&#xD;

      Argumentation Rendu-Osler syndrome, rare but ubiquitary, affects at least 8000 persons in&#xD;
      France. This genetic disorder is characterised by a dominant autosomal hereditary&#xD;
      transmission of telangiectasis and arteriovenous fistulae. The most apparent expression of&#xD;
      the disorder, often the cause of chronic anaemia, is the occurrence of spontaneous, repeated,&#xD;
      frequent and sometimes abundant epistaxis to the extent that continuous martial treatment and&#xD;
      multiple transfusions are necessary. The handling of this major symptom of the disorder is&#xD;
      badly coded and often demands local ENT treatments or medication whose efficacy is not&#xD;
      sufficiently documented. Among them, an anti-fibrinolytic, tranexamic acid, has been&#xD;
      evaluated several times with a low level of proof, so that it is regularly prescribed with a&#xD;
      good impression of efficacy for certain patients. It therefore seems essential that these&#xD;
      prescriptions should be based on more reliable data thereby providing clearer information to&#xD;
      patients regarding the expected benefits. The recent report of a high frequency of&#xD;
      thrombophlebitis in RO patients and the ancient concept of coagulation disorders or&#xD;
      thrombosis (Bick 1981) have lead to a restriction of the inclusion criteria and a systematic&#xD;
      search for a possible iatrogenic effect (inferior limbs venous echodoppler).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific Objectives Primary objective : Demonstrate that oral intake of tranexamic acid&#xD;
      significantly reduces the risk of epistaxis occurrence, estimated by the average monthly&#xD;
      duration of episodes of epistaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Document the benefit of tranexamic acid on the amount of haemoglobine and quality of&#xD;
           life of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify scalable and genetic factors of response to the treatment by tranexamic acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe compliance and tolerance of the treatment. Method Experimental Design We&#xD;
           suggest the realisation of a randomised comparative clinical trial versus placebo, with&#xD;
           a crossover of random alternated periods of three months over a total of six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population 213 affected patients, displaying sufficiently invalidating epistaxis to&#xD;
      require a basal treatment, will be recruited and followed every 3 months. Recruitment will&#xD;
      lean on teams who are part of the national French network in close collaboration with the&#xD;
      reference centre for the Rendu-Osler disorder, appointed to Lyon on the 19th of November&#xD;
      2004. Follow up of the study will be carried out by the Clinical Investigational Centre of&#xD;
      the related towns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures The main criterion of efficacy is the average duration of epistaxis, the&#xD;
      secondary criterion of efficacy is the average number of epistaxis measured per month.&#xD;
      Tolerance will be analysed according to the occurrence of venal or arterial thrombosis and&#xD;
      allergic accidents. Venal thrombosis will systematically be sought by an inferior limbs&#xD;
      echodoppler. Response markers will be sought through modelisation incorporating&#xD;
      environmental, phenotypic and genetic factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected benefits From an individual point of view, the knowledge of the response to&#xD;
      tranexamic acid measured the most precisely possible, represents a benefit for each study&#xD;
      participant, who will be able to continue the treatment knowingly if it proves efficient.&#xD;
      From a general point of view, the ATERO study will aid in the decision whether to continue&#xD;
      this course of action which despite its lack of proof is justified by its efficacy as well as&#xD;
      its cost and absence of adverse effects. The precise documentation of its innocuousness may&#xD;
      be necessary by the means of a specific study depending on the results on the ATERO study.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Repeated, spontaneous epistaxis in a known Rendu Osler patient who wants global&#xD;
             caring, these must be daily epistaxis (&gt; 28 a month) or a total amount of 60 minutes&#xD;
             of bleeding a month (50 % Rendu-Osler patients bleed before 20 and 99 % at 50 when&#xD;
             penetrance is complete).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Good completion of the grid of control by recording the number and duration of&#xD;
             epistaxis over a period of three month.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Rendu Osler syndrome with specific phenotype : absence of epistaxis or occasional&#xD;
             epistaxis, no need for particular care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Maintained expectations of an ENT treatment of epistaxis in a delay of three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Incapacity of detailing the number of epistaxis, especially, at least, within three&#xD;
             months before entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No informed consent obtained after informing the patient on his participation to the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Expected lack of observance because of an incapacity to compel to the daily treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Formal indication to Tranexamic Acid (angioneurotic oedema as a disease modifying&#xD;
             treatment of 3 to 4 g/ day).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contra-indications to Tranexamic acid: history of convulsion, arterial or veinous&#xD;
             thrombosis, , positivity of veinous echo doppler of the inferior limbs; Serum&#xD;
             creatinine &gt; 250 µmol/l.&#xD;
&#xD;
        N.B. Cases of bad observance are not frequent, patients being highly concerned with a&#xD;
        treatment to reduce their discomfort and anaemia. They are more likely ready to move to a&#xD;
        centre insuring this handling. Nevertheless, lack of observance will be detected over a&#xD;
        period of 15 days of placebo in simple blind, before randomization.&#xD;
