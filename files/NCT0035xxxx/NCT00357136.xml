  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers at Towson University are conducting a study of computer password behaviors among&#xD;
      users who have difficulty using their hands and arms (e.g., individuals with carpal tunnel&#xD;
      syndrome, high level spinal cord injuries, etc.). Volunteers are needed to take a short 5-10&#xD;
      minute online survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey is completely confidential and anonymous. If you would like to participate, please&#xD;
      visit the URL below. Thank you.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two researchers from the Department of Computer &amp; Information Sciences at Towson University&#xD;
      are seeking individuals who have difficulty using their hands and arms (e.g., as result of&#xD;
      carpal tunnel syndrome, high level spinal cord injuries, etc.) to participate in a survey.&#xD;
      The survey should take approximately 10 minutes to complete and all responses will remain&#xD;
      completely confidential and anonymous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the survey is to gain insight into the computing behaviors of individuals with&#xD;
      upper-body motor impairments. We expect that the results will help researchers and system&#xD;
      developers create more effective access control techniques to meet the special needs of this&#xD;
      user population. The results should also assist employers in providing improved technical and&#xD;
      procedural support to computer users that have difficulties using standard input devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you would like to take the online survey, please go to the following link:&#xD;

&#xD;
      If you prefer a paper version of the survey, please send us an e-mail that contains your&#xD;
      mailing address and we will send the survey to you.&#xD;
