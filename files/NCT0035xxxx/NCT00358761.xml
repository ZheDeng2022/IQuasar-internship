      This study will evaluate blood and tissue samples for a condition called Southern&#xD;
      Tick-Associated Rash Illness (STARI). This is a skin rash resembling erythema migrans, the&#xD;
      rash found in people infected with Lyme disease. In the south and southeastern United States,&#xD;
      STARI is associated with the bite of the lone star tick. Researchers seek a better&#xD;
      understanding of the cause of STARI. Through researchers' knowledge, diagnostic tests could&#xD;
      be developed. NIH is conducting this study along with the Centers for Disease Control and&#xD;
      Prevention (CDC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients ages 14 years and older who have recently been diagnosed with possible STARI, who&#xD;
      have not taken antibiotics for it longer than 1 day, and whose skin does not form large scars&#xD;
      may be eligible for this study. About 20 participants will be enrolled over a 5-year period.&#xD;
      Patients will visit the NIH Clinical Center for two or three visits. The first visit may last&#xD;
      2 hours. Photographs will be taken of the rash, and a blood sample of about 1-1/2 tablespoons&#xD;
      will be collected for tests. Patients will undergo a punch biopsy of three small pieces of&#xD;
      skin, from the rash. The area of the skin will be cleaned, and patients will receive a local&#xD;
      anesthetic at the biopsy site. A sharp instrument will remove a round plug of skin, about the&#xD;
      size of half a pencil eraser. Patients may feel a pushing sensation, but there should not be&#xD;
      pain. The site usually heals without sutures, though the doctors may close it with special&#xD;
      adhesive bandages or one or two sutures. Patients will receive instructions about how to take&#xD;
      care of the biopsy site. If sutures are used, patients will return in 7 to 10 days to have&#xD;
      them removed-or a patient's own doctor may remove the sutures. Patients will return to NIH at&#xD;
      4 to 6 weeks following their first visit. At that time, they will answer questions about how&#xD;
      they are doing and donate about 2 tablespoons of blood. Blood and skin samples will be used&#xD;
      for research at NIH and CDC.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Southern Tick-Associated Rash Illness (STARI) is a rash similar to the rash of Lyme disease&#xD;
      that occurs in persons residing in southeastern and south-central states and is associated&#xD;
      with the bite of the lone star tick, Amblyomma americanum. The cause of the rash is unknown,&#xD;
      as it is the natural course of the disease. This protocol aims to investigate the cause of&#xD;
      STARI, in conjunction with the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Skin biopsies&#xD;
      and blood samples will be taken from patients with suspected STARI and will be used to search&#xD;
      for an infectious agent and to develop diagnostic tests for the disease.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Enrolled in protocol 02-I-0055.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A person who is at least 14 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Acute onset (within 14 days of visit to NIH) of an annular, erythematous, expanding&#xD;
        erythema migrans (EM)-like rash that attains a size of at least 5 cm in diameter, when no&#xD;
        alternative explanation for the rash can be found, and thought by the study physician to&#xD;
        have a high likelihood to be due to STARI (due to exposure history, tick identification).&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of tick bite at the rash site, or potential exposure to ticks in the southeastern&#xD;
        and south central United States within 14 days prior to rash onset (including Maryland and&#xD;
        Virginia).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Consent to storage of biologic samples for later testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A person who, in the judgment of the investigator, would be at increased risk from the skin&#xD;
        biopsy procedure and unlikely to be able to mount a serological response to the agent (for&#xD;
        example, bone marrow transplant, B cell deficiency).&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION FROM SKIN BIOPSY PORTION OF STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A person who meets the case definition but whose EM-like rash occurs on the face, neck,&#xD;
        scalp, or over the tibia will not be enrolled for purposes of obtaining a skin biopsy&#xD;
        specimen. Such a person may enroll for purposes of providing a clinical history and blood&#xD;
        samples only. This exclusion also applies to patients with a history of forming large thick&#xD;
        scars after skin injuries or surgery, or who have a history of excessive bleeding after&#xD;
        cuts or procedures or are taking anticoagulants, or have severe skin disease. Also,&#xD;
        patients who have received more than 24 hours of antibiotic treatment for the rash will be&#xD;
        excluded from the biopsy. Patient with a history of allergy to lidocaine will also be&#xD;
        excluded from the biopsy portion of the study.&#xD;
