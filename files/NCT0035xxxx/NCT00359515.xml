  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the genetic basis of oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe (OCRL)-a&#xD;
      rare X-linked disorder (carried by females and passed to males). Patients with OCRL have&#xD;
      abnormal development of the eye lens, developmental delay, muscle weakness and kidney&#xD;
      dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will examine DNA and cell samples obtained and archived from patients with OCRL&#xD;
      enrolled in a previous protocol (HG008A) between 1996 and 1999. It will identify mutations in&#xD;
      the OCRL1 gene responsible for OCRL in affected males and try to correlate them with specific&#xD;
      biochemical or cellular activities (e.g., enzyme activity, protein stability, cellular&#xD;
      localization and trafficking). When test results are available, the information will be&#xD;
      communicated to the patients, their parents (if the patient is a minor) and their physicians,&#xD;
      and families will receive genetic counseling.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe (OCRL) is a rare X-linked disorder characterized by&#xD;
      congenital cataracts, mental retardation, and renal tubular dysfunction. Patients with known&#xD;
      or suspected OCRL were enrolled under previous protocol 96-HG-0008 that expired in 1998 and&#xD;
      was not renewed. We are continuing studies of DNA and cell samples obtained and archived&#xD;
      under our previous protocol to identify mutations in the OCRL1 gene responsible for Lowe&#xD;
      syndrome and related disorders in affected males and attempt to correlate these mutations to&#xD;
      particular biochemical or cellular phenotypes (enzyme activity, protein stability, cellular&#xD;
      localization and trafficking). Information about genotypes will not be communicated back to&#xD;
      the patients, their parents (if patient is a minor) or their physicians as part of this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are also continuing our investigations of heterogeneity in OCRL by studying collected cell&#xD;
      cultures from our collaborator Dr. Steven Scheinman at Suny New York Medical University,&#xD;
      Syracuse, from a group of patients with mutations in OCRL1 who have Dent disease,&#xD;
      characterized by renal tubular dysfunction. These data, and the variability in the renal and&#xD;
      CNS abnormalities that occur in OCRL are evidence for the existence of modifiers. We propose&#xD;
      to identify genes that are differentially expressed in cells from OCRL patients, patients&#xD;
      with Dent disease and OCRL1 mutations by gene expression analysis of RNA from patient&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of our study on phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity in OCRL, mutation analysis&#xD;
      resulted in the identification of mutations mostly in the second two-thirds of OCRL1.&#xD;
      However, the OCRL1 mutations in the Dent disease patients have been found in the first third&#xD;
      of OCRL1. We plan to send samples from Lowe syndrome patients without identified OCRL1&#xD;
      mutations to a Dr. Steven Scheinman who will look for such OCRL1 mutations. He will be sent&#xD;
      only coded samples and will look for such OCRL1 mutations. He will be sent only coded samples&#xD;
      and will not have access to patient identifiers. This information will be used for research&#xD;
      purposes only.&#xD;
