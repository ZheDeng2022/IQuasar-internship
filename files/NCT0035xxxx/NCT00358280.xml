      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy, duration of motor block until return to&#xD;
      normal function in the non-operated leg after the start of injection, of ropivacaine 5 mg/ml&#xD;
      and bupivacaine 5 mg/ml when used for spinal anaesthesia in patients undergoing unilateral&#xD;
      lower limb surgery.&#xD;
