      The purpose of this research project is to study the effect of micordermabrasion to try to&#xD;
      improve the appearance of facial acne. The microdermabrasion machine is a hand-held device&#xD;
      that directs pressurized aluminum oxide crystals at its target accompanied by a suction&#xD;
      device. It is not yet clear how much improvement can be seen with these treatments or exactly&#xD;
      how the skin's response causes these improvements. In this study, we are interested in&#xD;
      learning how well microdermabrasion works to improve the symptoms of acne.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acne vulgaris remains among the most common cutaneous disorders, impacting the vast majority&#xD;
      of people at some point during their lives. It is associated with significant psychosocial&#xD;
      morbidity, and there remains the need for efficacious and low risk therapeutic options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microdermabrasion is a technique combining abrasion and negative pressure used primarily in&#xD;
      the treatment of aging skin. It has also been proposed to improve acne presumably through a&#xD;
      comedolytic effect. Negative pressure and abrasion may remove debris from follicular orifices&#xD;
      that act as a nidus for acne lesions. Many physicians and spas use micordermabrasion as a&#xD;
      treatment for acne, however, there has never been a randomized controlled trial to&#xD;
      substantiate this practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to evaluate the efficacy of microdermabrasion in the treatment of inflammatory&#xD;
      acne. We will use the Bellamed microdermabrasion system produced by Bella products or the&#xD;
      Altair Diamondtome System.&#xD;

In all cases, microdermabrasion treatment parameters will be within those accepted in cosmetic work.</description>
