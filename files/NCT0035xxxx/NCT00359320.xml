      Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is a commonly performed operative procedure which is used in&#xD;
      selected patients with benign and malignant diseases of the pancreas and periampullary&#xD;
      region. The procedure involves regional resection of the pancreatic head, neck, and uncinate&#xD;
      process en-bloc with the duodenum, distal bile duct, and lymph nodes. The standard 'Whipple'&#xD;
      operation also adds a distal gastrectomy to the above procedures, while a pylorus-preserving&#xD;
      pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD) spares the distal stomach. The indications for PD include&#xD;
      neoplastic processes confined to the periampullary region, such as pancreatic cancer, distal&#xD;
      common bile duct cancer, duodenal cancer, ampullary cancer, neuroendocrine tumors, cystic&#xD;
      tumors, etc. A small number of benign conditions, such as chronic pancreatitis and benign&#xD;
      neoplasms are also treated with PD. Upon completion of the pancreatic resection, 3&#xD;
      anastomoses are used to re-establish GI continuity-a pancreatic-enteric anastomosis, a&#xD;
      biliary-enteric anastomosis, and a gastro or duodeno-enteric anastomosis. The&#xD;
      pancreatic-enteric anastomosis has traditionally been the most troubling of these anastomoses&#xD;
      because of a failure to heal and resultant fistulas and leaks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operative mortality rate for PD is usually less than 5% in major surgical centers with&#xD;
      significant experience with the procedure. The leading causes of mortality include&#xD;
      hemorrhage, cardiac events, and sepsis (often related to a pancreatic-enteric fistula). In&#xD;
      contrast to this low mortality rate, the morbidity rate is still quite high with one review&#xD;
      showing a rate of 40%. One of the most common causes of morbidity is a leak or pancreatic&#xD;
      fistula from the pancreatic-enteric anastomosis. A recent review estimated the incidence of&#xD;
      this complication to be 10% to 28.5%. A pancreatic fistula is currently defined by the&#xD;
      International Study Group for Pancreatic Fistulas (ISGPF) as drain amylase levels that are ≥3&#xD;
      times normal amylase levels from the third postoperative day onward, if drain output is ≥&#xD;
      10ml, and if the color of the drained fluid is altered (non-serous). Several large single&#xD;
      institution series from the Mannheim, Lahey, and Mayo Clinics have shown leak rates of&#xD;
      11-15%. The Mannheim Clinic series demonstrated that 20% of the pancreatic fistulas were&#xD;
      directly responsible for postoperative deaths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been several randomized prospective trials by investigators at the Johns Hopkins&#xD;
      Hospital which have tested various interventions attempting to improve the leakage rates. In&#xD;
      one trial, they determined that leak rates were similar (11-12%) whether the&#xD;
      pancreatic-enteric anastomosis was a pancreaticojejunostomy (PJ) or a pancreaticogastrostomy&#xD;
      (PG). In another trial, these investigators evaluated the use of prophylactic octreotide as&#xD;
      an agent to reduce pancreatic fistula rates-in this study there was no decrease in fistula&#xD;
      rates with the use of octreotide. Finally, these authors most recently performed a&#xD;
      randomized, prospective trial of stenting the pancreatic-enteric anastomosis. In this trial,&#xD;
      the fistula rates were not changed by the placement of a perioperative stent across the&#xD;
      anastomosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two widely used methods for the PJ reconstruction after PD-invagination or&#xD;
      'dunking' the pancreatic remnant or end-to-side duct-to-mucosa PJ. In the invagination&#xD;
      technique, the cut end of the pancreas in sewn into an opening in the side of the jejunum&#xD;
      using two layers of suture-an outer layer of permanent suture on the pancreas capsule and&#xD;
      bowel serosa and muscle, and an inner layer of running dissolvable suture on the duct and&#xD;
      pancreatic parenchyma and full thickness of the bowel wall. In the duct-to-mucosa technique,&#xD;
      there is again an outer layer of interrupted permanent suture. However, the inner layer is an&#xD;
      interrupted anastomosis between the pancreatic duct and the bowel mucosa. In one single&#xD;
      institution study utilizing the duct-to-mucosa technique and an internal stent, Strasberg et&#xD;
      al demonstrated a pancreatic fistula rate of 1.6% in 123 patients. In another review by Tani&#xD;
      et al, the fistula rate was 11% for the stented duct-to-mucosa technique and 6.5% for the 2&#xD;
      layer end-to-side externally stented technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been only one small randomized, prospective trial evaluating a duct-to-mucosa&#xD;
      versus an end-to-side PJ reported in the literature. In this trial, the authors randomized&#xD;
      144 patients undergoing PD to either a 2-layer duct-to-mucosa anastomosis or a single layer&#xD;
      end-to-side anastomosis which was not invaginated. Pancreatic fistulas were seen in 14% of&#xD;
      patients-13% in the duct-to-mucosa group and 15% in the end-to-side group and there was no&#xD;
      difference in complications between groups. It is not entirely clear from this study how&#xD;
      these anastomoses were performed, but it does not appear that their construction was&#xD;
      compatible to the methods that are most commonly used today.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we propose to perform a randomized, prospective, controlled study comparing these&#xD;
      two techniques. This study will be offered to all patients at Thomas Jefferson Hospital&#xD;
      undergoing PD. Patients will be recruited on the basis of the preoperative anticipation of&#xD;
      pancreaticoduodenal resection and preoperative consent will be obtained. Stratification and&#xD;
      randomization will be performed intraoperatively, following pancreaticoduodenal resection.&#xD;
      Because many studies have demonstrated that leak rates are directly related to pancreatic&#xD;
      texture, we will stratify into two groups: soft (normal) texture (predicted fistula rate of&#xD;
      15-30%) and hard (fibrotic) texture (predicted fistula rate of 0-15%). Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to one of two groups: 1) pancreatic duct to jejunal mucosa, two-layer anastomosis&#xD;
      or 2) end-to-side, two-layer, invagination technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intraoperative management of the patients will not be influenced by this study and will&#xD;
      be under the direction of the attending surgeon. The perioperative care of the patient,&#xD;
      including the use of prophylactic antibiotics, gastric acid secretory inhibition agents,&#xD;
      nasogastric tubes, the timing of removal of operatively placed closed-suction drains, and the&#xD;
      restoration of oral intake will remain under the direction of the attending surgeon. If a&#xD;
      postoperative pancreatic fistula does occur, the attending surgeon will manage the fistula&#xD;
      appropriately. We have a Critical Pathway in place which we will use to standardize patient&#xD;
      care and insure uniform postoperative management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately following the PD, the attending surgeon will complete a short questionnaire&#xD;
      documenting the type of resection performed, the type of anastomosis, the character of the&#xD;
      remnant pancreas, the size of the pancreatic duct, how the pancreas was transected (stapler,&#xD;
      electrocautery, etc), and other details of the operative procedure. Other routine data that&#xD;
      will be collected includes further details of the operative procedure (from the operative&#xD;
      report), pathology of the resected specimen (from the pathology report), and occurrence of&#xD;
      postoperative morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
