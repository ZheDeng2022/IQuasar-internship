      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil, work&#xD;
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by&#xD;
      stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells.&#xD;
      Giving combination chemotherapy together with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving combination chemotherapy together&#xD;
      with radiation therapy works in treating patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer.&#xD;
      The doctor also wants to find out if patients who receive this treatment need a feeding tube&#xD;
      1 year after starting treatment.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine feeding tube dependency at 12 months in patients with locally advanced head&#xD;
           and neck cancer treated with induction chemotherapy comprising docetaxel, cisplatin, and&#xD;
           fluorouracil followed by cisplatin and reduced-dose radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the progression-free, disease-free, and overall survival of patients treated&#xD;
           with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the pattern of failure in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess pre- and post-treatment swallowing ability of patients and the impact on their&#xD;
           quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quantify salivary flow rates of patients receiving chemotherapy with radiotherapy for&#xD;
           head and neck malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the quality of saliva by examining total protein concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quantify proangiogenic cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1, IL-6, IL-8, and vascular&#xD;
           endothelial growth factor) in the saliva of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the degree of mucositis and xerostomia of patients receiving chemotherapy with&#xD;
           radiotherapy for head and neck malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare salivary flow rates with the grade of mucositis and xerostomia of patients&#xD;
           receiving chemotherapy with radiotherapy for head and neck malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour and cisplatin IV over 1&#xD;
           hour on day 1 followed by fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1- 4. Patients also&#xD;
           receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) on days 5-14 or pegfilgrastim SC on day&#xD;
           5. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
           or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a partial or clinical complete response&#xD;
           proceed to chemoradiotherapy 3 weeks later.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chemoradiotherapy: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats&#xD;
           every 3 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
           toxicity. Patients also undergo concurrent reduced-dose radiotherapy 5 days a week for 6&#xD;
           weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgery: Approximately 6 to 8 weeks after completing chemoradiotherapy, patients with&#xD;
           residual neck disease or disease initially staged at N2 or greater undergo neck&#xD;
           dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva is collected periodically to measure flow rates and quality; quantify proangiogenic&#xD;
      cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1, IL-6, IL-8 and vascular endothelial growth factor); and&#xD;
      examine the grade of mucositis and xerostomia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, before chemoradiotherapy, 1 month after the last&#xD;
      radiation treatment, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years and then&#xD;
      annually thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
