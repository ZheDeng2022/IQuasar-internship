  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some patients receiving mechanical ventilation have difficulty weaning off the ventilator&#xD;
      because of physiological factors such as pre-existing lung disease, respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome, and trauma among others. Allowing patients to become hypercarbic (increased blood&#xD;
      bicarbonate level) may make it easier for these patients to be taken off the ventilator and&#xD;
      resume breathing on their own.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this research is to assess the utility of permissive hypercarbia&#xD;
      (PH) in the weaning of patients with risk factors for difficult weaning from mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation. This pilot study seeks to validate the concept that PH will significantly&#xD;
      improve the ability of patients to be weaned from mechanical ventilation and change the&#xD;
      approach that physicians take to ventilator weaning for many patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null Hypothesis: Patients with PH will not be weaned from mechanical ventilation more rapidly&#xD;
      than those not receiving PH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with significant lung disease fail weaning from mechanical ventilation either as a&#xD;
      result of an inability to oxygenate the blood or to adequately remove carbon dioxide. This&#xD;
      results in longer Intensive Care Unit stays and increased morbidity and mortality as these&#xD;
      patients have prolonged periods of mechanical ventilation. This study will focus on patients&#xD;
      who have failure to adequately remove carbon dioxide (ventilatory failure) and endeavors to&#xD;
      evaluate a method for enhanced carbon dioxide elimination by altering the acid-base status of&#xD;
      the patients utilizing permissive hypercarbia (PH). PH will be used specifically during&#xD;
      weaning from mechanical ventilation to enhance carbon dioxide elimination during this period.&#xD;
      PH has used by some intensivists for this purpose but has not been critically evaluated in a&#xD;
      clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanical ventilation using PH maintains an increased CO2 with either partial or complete&#xD;
      metabolic compensation. Therefore, the blood pH is either normal or slightly reduced. In&#xD;
      patients who are adequately sedated, the reduced pH is well tolerated without respiratory&#xD;
      distress or air hunger. However, if PH is to be used in awake patients as proposed here, full&#xD;
      metabolic compensation would be required to avoid air hunger while being weaned from&#xD;
      ventilator support. The metabolic compensation is produced either as a result of a renal&#xD;
      compensation or, more typically in the ICU setting, iatrogenically. Metabolic alkalosis can&#xD;
      be produced through the administration of alkalinizing agents or as a result of gastric&#xD;
      suctioning or from contraction alkalosis resulting from the use of diuretics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PH enhances CO2 elimination by increasing the concentration of CO2 in the exhaled gas. The&#xD;
      pulmonary capillary pCO2 is elevated and therefore so is the alveolar CO2 and the exhaled or&#xD;
      end-tidal CO2. Thus more CO2 is exhaled in an equal volume of exhaled gas. This increased CO2&#xD;
      concentration reduces the minute ventilation required to exhale the CO2 produced by the&#xD;
      patient. PH will decrease the minute ventilation requirement even in patients with an&#xD;
      increased dead space and will facilitate weaning these patients from mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      by the same mechanism as just described.&#xD;
