        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects who had type 2 diabetes treated with diet and exercise only for at least 2&#xD;
             weeks prior to randomization, or who were previously or currently treated with an oral&#xD;
             agent and had not responded to diet, exercise, and oral therapy for at least 3 months&#xD;
             (documented by an HbA1c &gt;7.5%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects who completed glimepiride pharmacokinetic Study HOE 490/4045 at preselected&#xD;
             sites within 3 weeks prior to the screening period were also permitted to enroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects were required to be negative for islet cell antigen (ICA) and glutamic acid&#xD;
             decarboxylase (GAD) autoantibodies and to have a C-peptide level at 90 minutes of â‰¥&#xD;
             1.5 ng/mL. The HbA1c was required to be &gt;7.1% at screening and &lt;12.0% on the day of&#xD;
             randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects meeting any of the following criteria were not to be included in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A history of an acute metabolic complication such as diabetic ketoacidosis within 3&#xD;
             months before screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. On insulin therapy, or had received insulin for &gt;6 weeks, 3 months prior to&#xD;
             randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. On weight-reduction medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Known hypersensitivity to biguanides, sulfonamides, or insulin&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Pregnant or lactating females&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Clinically significant renal (serum creatinine level &gt;1.0 mg/dL) or hepatic disease&#xD;
             (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] or aspartate aminotransferase [AST] &gt;2.5 times the&#xD;
             upper limits of normal [ULN])&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. GI disorders that may interfere with the absorption of the study drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Chronic use of medications known to affect glucose levels such as intermittent use of&#xD;
             systemic corticosteroids or large dose of inhaled steroids&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Clinically significant laboratory abnormality on screening laboratory tests or any&#xD;
             medical condition that in the opinion of the investigator would affect the outcome of&#xD;
             the study&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of drug or alcohol abuse&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Treatment with any investigational product in the last 3 months before study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. History of noncompliance with regard to follow-up medical care&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Any disease or condition that in the opinion of the investigator and/or sponsor may&#xD;
             interfere with completion of the study&#xD;
