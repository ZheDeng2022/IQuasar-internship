  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research project is to determine the effects of oral tetracycline such as&#xD;
      Minocycline (Minocin) on tear film composition and tear lipid (meibomian gland secretions)&#xD;
      characteristics in patients with chronic Blepharitis and associated dry eyes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tear film dysfunctions, which are collectively diagnosed as dry eye syndromes and Meibomian&#xD;
      Gland Dystrophy (MGD) afflict millions of individuals worldwide, more than 10 million in the&#xD;
      United States alone. Typically, symptoms include ocular burning, foreign body sensation,&#xD;
      photophobia, redness and other symptoms that result in overall chronic discomfort in&#xD;
      patients. Tetracycline analogues, such as minocycline, have demonstrated effectiveness in&#xD;
      treating primary meibomianitis, one type of chronic blepharitis and have been prescribed to&#xD;
      patients for sometime. It has been demonstrated that tetracycline can inhibit lipase activity&#xD;
      and therefore decrease the release of noxious free fatty acids. Tetracycline also inhibits&#xD;
      bacterial lipase activity in vitro and has other effects. We have been investigating the&#xD;
      associations between chronic blepharitis and eyelid meibomian gland lipids and microflora for&#xD;
      a number of years and have discovered important relationships between these lipids and&#xD;
      chronic blepharitis disease states. Because of its high concentration 12 hours post dose, low&#xD;
      renal clearance, long half life, and high level of binding to serum proteins, minocycline has&#xD;
      been suggested as a good treatment option. The study proposes to determine the effect of oral&#xD;
      treatment with tetracycline analogues on the Tear Film and Tear Lipid Composition within a&#xD;
      Population of Patients Diagnosed with Dry Eye Disease and Meibomian Gland Dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients diagnosed with dry eye syndrome as well as Meibomian Gland Dystrophy (MGD) will be&#xD;
      selected to participate in a clinical study: baseline visit, 1-month following initiation of&#xD;
      treatment, 3-months after initiation of treatment, and 3-months after discontinuation of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once assessed and qualified to take part in the trial, participants will undergo the&#xD;
      following tests during each visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Ocular assessment of signs and symptoms II. Evaporometry III. Fluorophotometery IV.&#xD;
      Schirmers Testing V. TBUT VI. Bacteriology VII. Transillumination &amp; Meibography VIII.&#xD;
      Meibomian gland expression and lipid analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the baseline visit, each patient will be given a 2-week regimen of 50-mg&#xD;
      dose of Minocycline followed by 10-week supply of 100-mg Minocycline to be taken daily after&#xD;
      breakfast. In addition, they can continue using artificial tears and additional treatments as&#xD;
      prescribed by their treating physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Ocular assessment Patients' symptomology as well as the assessors' diagnostic findings&#xD;
      will be recorded and reviewed in detail before patient entrance into study. These include&#xD;
      visual acuity, biomicroscopy of lids/lashes, conjunctiva, and cornea. Moreover, corneal as&#xD;
      well as conjunctival staining will be performed with the use of two colored dyes: Lissamine&#xD;
      green and fluorescein. In addition, the investigator will record any pathology with the&#xD;
      patients' natural lens, iris, and pupil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaporometer: Evaporative flow and contribution to turnover An evaporometer utilizes a&#xD;
      pump to direct air through a drying tube (Hammond Drierite, Xenia, OH) into a goggle. The&#xD;
      goggle containing a water vapor detector and a temperature monitor is placed firmly over the&#xD;
      eye. The pumped air passes into the goggle, reducing the humidity to 15%, at which time the&#xD;
      pump is turned off. The increase in humidity due to evaporation from skin or evaporating&#xD;
      tears is measured and stored in a computer. The process is carried out first with the eyelids&#xD;
      closed and then with them open; the difference is the tear evaporation rate. The area of the&#xD;
      interpalpebral ocular surface is used to calculate evaporation per unit area; the image of&#xD;
      the area is captured with the use of a digital camera and calculated directly with the aid of&#xD;
      computer software (ADOBE Photoshop, version 6.0.1.2001, ADOBE Systems, and San Jose,&#xD;
      California). Evaporative outflow as a percentage of available tear volume will be calculated&#xD;
      from the rate of the rise of relative humidity inside the goggle with the eye open minus the&#xD;
      evaporative contribution of the closed eye skin within the goggle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaporative contribution to turnover will be calculated as evaporative outflow per&#xD;
      available tear volume per minute divided by tear turnover.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Fluorophotometer: Tear volume, flow and turnover Background fluorescence will be&#xD;
      determined prior to the instillation of 0.5 micro liters of 0.5% sodium fluorescein onto the&#xD;
      ocular surface. Utilizing a fluorophotometer (Fluorotron Master, Ocumetrics, Mountain View,&#xD;
      CA), eight measurements will be taken from each eye to determine tear fluorescence. The first&#xD;
      two measurements will be performed one minute apart and subsequent measurements will be&#xD;
      repeated with three minute intervals until completion at 19 minutes. This data will be&#xD;
      analyzed to calculate tear volume, flow and tear turnover.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Schirmers testing: Quantitative tear measurement performed with and without anesthetic&#xD;
      Drops. A commonly used paper wick will be placed between the eyeball and outer third of the&#xD;
      lower lid cul-de-sac in order to measure quantitatively the production of tears. This test&#xD;
      typically takes 5 minutes to perform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Tear Break-Up Time - Quantitative/Qualitative assessment of corneal and conjunctival dry&#xD;
      spots (devitalized surface epithelial cells) A drop of fluorescein will be instilled in both&#xD;
      eyes of the patient. Patient will be asked to blink normally for the dye to spread evenly in&#xD;
      the eye. Once completed, patient will be asked to blink once and hold eyes open while the&#xD;
      assessor uses a stop watch to record number of seconds it takes for the tear film to&#xD;
      break-up. This is a tool that allows the examiner to grade the quality of the tear film.&#xD;
      Normal control patient TBUT is 10-12 seconds while a dry eye patient TBUT is less than 2&#xD;
      seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Bacteriology - Eyelid microflora evaluation Samples of eyelid and conjunctival microflora&#xD;
      of each eye will be taken separately with a calcium alginate swab dipped in 0.9% salt&#xD;
      solution. After streaking the swab on different plates (blood agar, chocolate agar, and&#xD;
      reduced brucella blood agar), it will placed into a tube of thioglycolate for bacteriological&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Transillumination &amp; Meibography - Quantitative assessment of lower lid meibomian gland&#xD;
      lipid production An excretory gland, the primary role of the meibomian glands is to produce&#xD;
      and secrete lipids into the tear film. The purpose of this test is to determine&#xD;
      quantitatively the number of lower lid glands that are functional lipid producers. A&#xD;
      transilluminator (muscle light) with a light dispersing tip will be used to illuminate the&#xD;
      glands. The small band of light will transilluminate the inverted lower lids of patients.&#xD;
      With the use of a digital camera, a picture will be taken in order to assess vital glands&#xD;
      from drop-outs (non-producing glands). This is accomplished with a frame grabber that is&#xD;
      matched to a Hitachi KP-F2A progressive scanner infrared camera that is mounted on a slit&#xD;
      lamp microscope. Images will be captured and stored with the use of imaging software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. Meibomian gland expression and lipid analysis - Lower and Upper eye lid samples will be&#xD;
      collected and assayed for their biochemical makeup With the use of an ocular conformer and&#xD;
      cotton tip applicator, samples of upper and lower lid meibomian gland lipids will be&#xD;
      collected and assessed for make-up&#xD;
