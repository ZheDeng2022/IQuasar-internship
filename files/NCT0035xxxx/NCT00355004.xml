      RATIONALE: Screening may help doctors find colorectal cancer sooner, when it may be easier to&#xD;
      treat. Computerized and mailed reminders may help increase the rate of colorectal cancer&#xD;
      screening in adults with an average risk for colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying how well computerized and mailed&#xD;
      reminders work in increasing the rate of colorectal cancer screening in adults with an&#xD;
      average risk for colorectal cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening can be increased among&#xD;
           average-risk adults by using patient-specific, active, electronic, clinical reminders&#xD;
           for primary care physicians during office visits and mailed reminders and fecal occult&#xD;
           blood test cards for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Calculate baseline rates of CRC screening, in terms of patient demographic&#xD;
           characteristics, primary care physician, and practice group, by using computerized&#xD;
           clinical information systems to identify patients due for screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess baseline rates of CRC screening among patients insured by different health plans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether the impact of the interventions is related to efforts by health plans&#xD;
           to promote CRC screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate patients' willingness to use a validated web-based tool to estimate their&#xD;
           personal risk of CRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms (arms&#xD;
      I or III). Physicians are randomized to 1 of 2 arms (arms II or IV).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I: Patients receive mailed reminders for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. Patients&#xD;
           also receive fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) instructions and cards. Patients who&#xD;
           remain overdue for screening at 6 months after the initial mailing receive a follow-up&#xD;
           letter reminding them of their need to be screened. Patients who return positive FOBT&#xD;
           cards undergo colonoscopy within 1 month. The patient's primary care physician may&#xD;
           receive computerized screening reminders at the time of the patient's office visit and&#xD;
           may order CRC screening tests online.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: Patients receive no mailings. The patient's primary care physician may receive&#xD;
           computerized screening reminders at the time of the patient's office visit and may order&#xD;
           CRC screening tests online.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm III: Patients receive mailed reminders for CRC screening. The patient's primary care&#xD;
           physician may order CRC screening tests online, but will not receive active computerized&#xD;
           reminders. Patients also receive FOBT instructions and cards. Patients who remain&#xD;
           overdue for screening at 6 months after the initial mailing receive a follow-up letter&#xD;
           reminding them of their need to be screened. Patients who return positive FOBT cards&#xD;
           will be scheduled to undergo colonoscopy within 1 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm IV: Patients receive no mailings. The patient's primary care physician may order CRC&#xD;
           screening tests online, but will not receive active computerized reminders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed for 15 months to determine screening rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21,860 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
