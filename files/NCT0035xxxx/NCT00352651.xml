  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if therapy with the drug pregabalin relieves pain during&#xD;
      shingles compared with placebo. A placebo is an inactive substance. Pregabalin is a drug&#xD;
      marketed as Lyricaâ„¢ in the United States for the treatment of seizures, diabetic neuropathy,&#xD;
      and post-herpetic neuralgia. The use of pregabalin and drugs like it for the treatment of&#xD;
      pain during the acute phase of shingles is experimental. Thirty four subjects will complete&#xD;
      the study at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Pain Clinical Research&#xD;
      Center. This study is funded by Pfizer Global Research.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The varicella zoster virus (VZV) is the smallest of the double-stranded DNA herpes viruses,&#xD;
      and the only one capable of producing two different diseases, varicella (chickenpox) and&#xD;
      herpes zoster (acute herpes zoster [AHZ], shingles). The incidence of AHZ, and the secondary&#xD;
      VZV infection, is strongly age-dependent and reaches 1% per year by age 80 and there are&#xD;
      between 300,000 and 1 million new cases of AHZ each year in the US. AHZ is almost always&#xD;
      painful, and the pain can be of disabling severity, rendering some sufferers bed-bound and&#xD;
      too incapacitated to carry out normal activities, leading to weight loss and dehydration&#xD;
      sufficient to require inpatient therapy. The elderly are especially likely to suffer severe&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common complication of AHZ is development of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Although&#xD;
      the overall incidence of PHN after AHZ is about 10%, the incidence has been reported to rise&#xD;
      as high as 80% in those over the age of 80. In all published studies, age and greater&#xD;
      severity of initial zoster pain are each found to significantly increase the risk of&#xD;
      developing PHN. Severe zoster pain is believed to correlate with a more severe cutaneous&#xD;
      outbreak, more severe inflammation of the nerve trunk, and possibly greater injury to primary&#xD;
      afferent nerve fibers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two separate issues to address when discussing the pain of AHZ. The first is&#xD;
      managing the AHZ pain itself, because the burden of suffering is so high. The second is&#xD;
      reducing the incidence of PHN. Both issues need to be considered in trial design, in part&#xD;
      because severe AHZ pain is itself a risk factor for PHN. Studies of the analgesic effect of&#xD;
      pregabalin suggest an analgesic profile similar to that of gabapentin. We would therefore&#xD;
      predict, that pregabalin would reduce the pain associated with AHZ and possibly prevent&#xD;
      development of PHN.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female 21 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects must have an acute outbreak of herpes zoster (HZ) with unilateral skin rash&#xD;
             and pain; the diagnosis will be based on physical examination and review of available&#xD;
             medical records confirming the outbreak.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects must have had pain present for more than 3 days but less than 42 days after&#xD;
             onset of the herpes zoster skin rash.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects at screening must have an average score of at least 40 mm on the visual&#xD;
             analog scale (VAS) of the SF-McGill Pain Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects must weigh more than 110 pounds and have a body mass index greater than or&#xD;
