  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Excessive bleeding is common after cardiac surgery. This may result in patients receiving a&#xD;
      blood transfusion or suffering the life-threatening complication of cardiac tamponade.&#xD;
      Tamponade is when excessive bleeding compresses the heart and prevents it from pumping&#xD;
      properly. A major reason for the bleeding is the damage done to platelets by the&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) machine. Often patients receive platelets and plasma from blood&#xD;
      donors to try to reduce the bleeding post-operatively. The investigators plan to take&#xD;
      platelets and plasma from patients before they are damaged. They would then return these&#xD;
      'undamaged' sequestered platelets to the patients after the bypass machine is no longer&#xD;
      needed. Therefore, the investigators' primary question is whether platelet sequestration&#xD;
      would reduce the bleeding problems that occur following cardiac surgery. They will evaluate&#xD;
      bleeding problems using thromboelastography, which provides a comprehensive assessment of&#xD;
      both how blood clots form and their strength. If sequestration reduces bleeding problems&#xD;
      following cardiac surgery then it may reduce the chance of patients receiving blood products&#xD;
      from donors. Although donated blood is thoroughly tested, its use does expose patients to the&#xD;
      risk of transfusion errors, blood borne infections and reactions. Avoiding its use would be&#xD;
      very desirable.&#xD;

      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing repeat median sternotomy or requiring prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass&#xD;
      (CPB) often develop a coagulopathy at the end of surgery. We propose sequestering plasma and&#xD;
      platelets from these patients prior to CPB and thus prior to the dilution and platelet damage&#xD;
      that occurs with CPB. We hypothesise that if these plasma and platelets are stored properly&#xD;
      during CPB, and administered at the end of the operation, they will reduce any coagulopathy&#xD;
      and the associated bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing repeat median sternotomy, mitral valve repair, double valve operations,&#xD;
      aortic surgery, or combined valve and coronary artery surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria will include those with anaemia, thrombocytopenia, unstable angina,&#xD;
      anti-platelet therapy within the previous seven days, known or symptomatic cerebrovascular&#xD;
      disease, known disorders of haemostasis, aprotinin sensitivity and pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised by a closed envelope technique to receive platelet/plasma&#xD;
      sequestration or not. Patients randomised to undergo sequestration will have 14 mL/Kg blood&#xD;
      taken. The blood will be separated into red cells and platelets/plasma. Anaemia would be&#xD;
      prevented by returning the processed red blood cells to the patient. We will store platelets&#xD;
      at 20-24Â°C/room temperature on a platelet rocker according to guidelines from the National&#xD;
      Blood Service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of coagulation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' coagulation status will be evaluated before and after surgery. Four methods will be&#xD;
      employed to comprehensively assess the coagulation system: platelet counts and conventional&#xD;
      clotting studies; heparin levels; thromboelastography; and platelet function analyser.&#xD;
