  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if dietary consumption of Revival Soy can improve&#xD;
      the appearance of the skin, hair, and finger nails and support weight loss in overweight,&#xD;
      premenopausal women.&#xD;

      The researchers hypothesize that supplementation of Revival® Soy products to overweight&#xD;
      premenopausal women as part of a soy-based meal replacement diet plan will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improve the health and appearance of the skin by normalizing skin pigmentation and&#xD;
           reducing wrinkles,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improve the health and appearance of hair by enhancing sheen and ease of combing, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improve the health and appearance of nails by enhancing shine, flexibility, and&#xD;
           strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stimulate a loss in weight and a reduction in the Body Mass Index (BMI),&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, obese (BMI = 30-40 kg/m2) premenopausal women (25-45 years of age) with mild&#xD;
      to moderate photoaging (n=40) will receive either a Revival® soy shake (20 grams soy protein&#xD;
      with 160 mg total isoflavones; n=20) or a placebo shake (20 grams of milk protein with 0 mg&#xD;
      isoflavones; n=20) daily for 6 months. The subjects will be asked to come into the office for&#xD;
      a total of seven visits, at baseline and at monthly intervals for 6 months. At baseline,&#xD;
      month 3, and month 6, the subjects will be asked to complete a questionnaire in order to&#xD;
      provide self-reported improvements related to hair, skin, and nail health. Following&#xD;
      completion of the questionnaire, the investigator and the dermatology clinic staff will&#xD;
      examine the subjects to assess the health and appearance of their skin, hair, and nails at&#xD;
      baseline, month 3, and month 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After acceptance into the study, a registered dietitian will instruct the study subjects in&#xD;
      the use of a low-energy (1,200 - 1,500 kcal/day) diet that incorporates 2 soy-based daily&#xD;
      meal replacements (shakes, ~500 kcal), a minimum of 5 daily servings of fruits and vegetables&#xD;
      (~300 kcal), and one entrée (~400 - 500 kcal). Subjects will be required to keep a dietary&#xD;
      food intake record of all food and supplement use during the trial. Anthropometric data&#xD;
      (height, body weight, waist circumference and hip circumference) will be collected at&#xD;
      baseline and at monthly intervals.&#xD;
