  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In blind individuals, the occipital cortex becomes capable of processing tactile and auditory&#xD;
      information, a phenomenon described as crossmodal plasticity. GABA is the major inhibitory&#xD;
      neurotransmitter in the brain and a possible candidate to mediate this form of human&#xD;
      plasticity. We intend to use magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure GABA and&#xD;
      hypothesize that GABA levels in the occipital cortex of blind humans will be lower than in&#xD;
      sighted controls. Such decrease could possibly mediate compensatory changes in the occipital&#xD;
      cortex of the blind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early blind subjects exhibit better tactile acuity than late blinds or sighted individuals.&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is the determine GABA levels in the human occipital cortex after&#xD;
      long-term light deprivation (blindness).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our experiments will make use of early blind, late blind, and sighted control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject will be identified and will receive clinical and neurological examinations at the&#xD;
      NIH. MRS studies will be performed at NIH MRI Center with 3Tesla Magnet. Each subject head&#xD;
      will be positioned in an adjustable holder (designed for minimal motion and maximal comfort)&#xD;
      such that a flat coil lay just below the occipital cortex. The sequence has been described&#xD;
      before [33]. The individuals who perform the data analysis will be blind to the purpose of&#xD;
      the experiments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concentration of GABA from the 14 ml voxel over the visual cortex will be measured.&#xD;
      Edited proton spectrum of GABA will be compared with the edited sub spectrum of creatine for&#xD;
      a concentration reference.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All subjects must be between 18 and 55 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy sighted volunteers. Legally blind subjects with blindness secondary to retinal&#xD;
        lesions or eye removal acquired at ages earlier than 4 years old (EARLY) and after 13 years&#xD;
        of age (LATE). The rationale for the distinction is based in our previous studies that&#xD;
        indicate different magnitude of brain plasticity depending on the age of acquisition of&#xD;
        blindness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria will be those of MRI procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant women tested after urine pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with metal in the cranium except mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with metal fragments from occupational exposure or surgical clips in or near the&#xD;
        brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with blood vessel, cochlear or eye implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with increased intracranial pressure as evaluated by clinical means.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with cardiac or neural pacemakers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with intracardiac lines and implanted medication pumps.&#xD;
