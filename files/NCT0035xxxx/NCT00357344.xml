      This study will evaluate how large, intentional weight reduction affects the human brain and&#xD;
      possible ways to reverse the changes associated with excess body weight. Subtle changes in&#xD;
      some brain regions occur in people who are overweight. Such changes may involve the&#xD;
      regulation of eating behavior, though it is not clear whether the changes were present before&#xD;
      weight gain or are a consequence. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to study&#xD;
      local structures of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients ages 18 to 45 who are undergoing gastric bypass surgery and who are not pregnant or&#xD;
      breastfeeding may be eligible for this study. A study group of lean participants will serve&#xD;
      as controls. Patients will visit the Phoenix Indian Medical Center for about 3 days at a time&#xD;
      for tests. They will have a medical examination, electrocardiogram, and tests of blood and&#xD;
      urine. Questionnaires they will complete involve patients' moods and possible influence on&#xD;
      eating behaviors, as well as food preferences. A taste test, smell test, and assessment of&#xD;
      decision-making processes will be conducted. An oral glucose tolerance test involves a needle&#xD;
      placed intravenously (IV) in the arm, for drawing blood after patients drink a sugar&#xD;
      solution. The test takes about 3-1/2 hours, with six blood samples taken (about 2 tablespoons&#xD;
      total). A meal test also includes use of an IV line. After patients consume a liquid meal,&#xD;
      blood will be collected to analyze levels of blood sugar and hormones. For the DEXA scan,&#xD;
      which measures body composition, patients will lie still while low-dose X-rays are used for 5&#xD;
      to 10 minutes. Urine will be collected for 1 whole day, to measure cortisol, a hormone. The&#xD;
      MRI scan uses a strong magnetic field to obtain images of body organs and tissues. Patients&#xD;
      having any metal in the body that may interfere with the scanning machine should not have&#xD;
      this test. For the MRI procedure, patients will lie on a table that slides into the enclosed&#xD;
      tunnel of the scanner and be asked to lie still. Patients will be able to communicate with&#xD;
      the MRI staff at all times during the scan, and they may ask to be removed from the machine&#xD;
      at any time.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND: We have identified subtle changes in some brain regions of obese subjects by&#xD;
      using a new computerized technique (voxel-based morphometry, VBM) which allows for studying&#xD;
      the local structure of the brain by taking very detailed pictures of the brain through&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and then processing these images with sophisticated&#xD;
      statistical software. Some of these regions may interfere with an obese person's ability to&#xD;
      predict future consequences of his or her eating behaviors. These changes may explain why&#xD;
      people have difficulty losing weight. However, it is not clear whether these changes in the&#xD;
      brain are present before or are a consequence of weight gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES: The main aim of this study will be to evaluate the effects of a large and&#xD;
      intentional weight reduction on the brains of obese individuals for assessing the possible&#xD;
      reversal of the changes associated with excess body weight. Additional objectives will be a)&#xD;
      to determine the possible behavioral correlates of the changes in brain tissue composition&#xD;
      associated with a large and intentional weight reduction and b) to confirm the results of our&#xD;
      previous exploratory analysis showing that human obesity is associated with changes in brain&#xD;
      structure in areas related to the regulation of eating behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: This is a longitudinal protocol mainly focused on obese patients undergoing roux-en-Y&#xD;
      gastric bypass (RYGBP), which represents the most effective approach currently available to&#xD;
      achieving substantial weight loss, thus maximizing our chances of detecting significant&#xD;
      changes in brain tissue composition. Therefore, we propose to study brain morphology and the&#xD;
      metabolic and behavioral characteristics of 40 obese patients undergoing RYGBP prior to and&#xD;
      3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 months after the surgery. Forty lean subjects (at 0, 12, 24, and 48&#xD;
      months) will also be studied for comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES: The volumes of the different components of the brain by VBM of MRI&#xD;
      pictures; metabolic parameters relevant to the relationship between obesity and the brain by&#xD;
      measuring fasting concentrations and postprandial responses of some metabolites; the ability&#xD;
      to regulate reward and behavior by specific tasks and questionnaires; the ability to detect&#xD;
      and discriminate smells by olfaction tests.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ethnicity: Caucasian, due to the cross-sectional analysis, upon which the present&#xD;
        longitudinal study is based, being made up of Caucasian subjects and the lack of normative&#xD;
        data in other racial and ethnic groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age 18-45 years, to minimize the confounding role of the well-known effects of aging on&#xD;
        brain tissue composition. There is, in fact, compelling evidence from post mortem and in&#xD;
        vivo studies that the brain shrinks with age. Neuropathological and CT and MRI morphometric&#xD;
        studies indicated that aging predominantly and substantially affects the GM. In addition,&#xD;
        deep WM lesions are seen on MRIs in approximately one-third of asymptomatic elderly&#xD;
        subjects. Blood pressure also rises with increasing age and can affect brain morphology.&#xD;
        Several studies provided evidence of specific patterns in the structural brain correlates&#xD;
        of aging, not only globally, between GM and WM compartments, but also locally, within&#xD;
        regions of the brain. Therefore, to limit the confounding effect of aging on brain tissue&#xD;
        composition, which could theoretically overlap with and confound those of weight loss, the&#xD;
        age limit for entering the study will be 45 years.&#xD;
