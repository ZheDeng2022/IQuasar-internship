      This clinical trial tests the effectiveness of cognitive therapy (CT) to improve outcomes in&#xD;
      outpatients diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who manifest prominent&#xD;
      negative symptoms. It is hypothesized that patients receiving cognitive therapy will manifest&#xD;
      lower negative symptom levels and improved engagement in constructive activity relative to&#xD;
      patients who receive treatment-as-usual. Further, it is predicted that these differences&#xD;
      between CT and TAU will be larger when patients are assessed 6 and 12 months after the end of&#xD;
      treatment (18 and 24 months after study entry).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of adjunctive cognitive behavioral therapy&#xD;
      for negative symptoms and functioning in chronic outpatients diagnosed with schizophrenia or&#xD;
      schizoaffective disorder. After a baseline assessment to ensure eligibility, seventy-five&#xD;
      consenting patients will be randomly assigned to receive a year of cognitive therapy (CT) or&#xD;
      to a treatment as usual (TAU) control condition. Measures of symptomatology (positive,&#xD;
      negative and affective), functioning, neurocognition and negativistic beliefs will be&#xD;
      administered to all participants during five formal assessment sessions to occur at 6-month&#xD;
      intervals over the course of a two-year period. The first assessment session (Baseline) will&#xD;
      occur shortly after (i.e., within a week, though typically on the same day) informed consent&#xD;
      is given. If the participant qualifies for the study and is consents to randomization,&#xD;
      assessments identical to the baseline in content will occur 6, 12, 18 and 24 months later.&#xD;
      All evaluators will be blind to participant treatment condition at the time of assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cognitive behavioral treatment will, in a collaborative and problem solving manner,&#xD;
      target inaccurate or overly pessimistic expectations and thoughts about social and non-social&#xD;
      performance. This psychosocial intervention will also target beliefs and attitudes that are&#xD;
      related to positive symptoms which, in turn, exacerbate negative symptoms and impair&#xD;
      functioning. We hypothesize that patients in the CT condition will have lower negative&#xD;
      symptom levels and elevated functioning as compared to the TAU patients at the post-treatment&#xD;
      assessment. Additionally, we expect that CT-treated patients will continue to improve over&#xD;
      the follow-up period and, thereby, to continue to manifest lowered negative symptoms and&#xD;
      elevated levels of functioning relative to TAU patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While research over the past 10 years has demonstrated the efficacy of CT as an adjunct&#xD;
      intervention in the treatment of schizophrenia, negative symptoms have not been targeted&#xD;
      directly, nor has an emphasis been placed upon improving functional outcomes. Given that&#xD;
      negative symptoms and functioning are particularly refractory in this population, there is a&#xD;
      need for treatment innovation. In this vein, our previous research (Grant &amp; Beck, 2006)&#xD;
      established that defeatist attitudes regarding social and non-social performance are&#xD;
      important mediators in the causal chains that link neurocognitive performance, negative&#xD;
      symptoms, and functional outcomes in schizophrenia. The current trial, thus, aims to move&#xD;
      therapy for schizophrenia forward by improving long-term outcomes for some of the most&#xD;
      impaired individuals in psychiatric service.&#xD;
