      This is a repeat insult patch test study. On treatment days, the investigational product&#xD;
      PEP005 Topical Gel (0.01% concentration) and vehicle control will be applied under open&#xD;
      conditions to sites on the infrascapular region of the back 3 times weekly for 3 weeks (9&#xD;
      applications in total) during the induction phase. Following a rest period of approximatley&#xD;
      10-14 days, a single challenge application will be performed. Local tolerability will be&#xD;
      assessed visually using an ordinal scoring system. If a cutaneous response observed in the&#xD;
      challenge phase indicates possible sensitisation, or at the discretion of the investigator, a&#xD;
      rechallenge will occur&#xD;
