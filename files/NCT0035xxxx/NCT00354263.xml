      This study is a single centre, single blind, placebo (step 1) or reference (step 2)&#xD;
      randomised study. Healthy young male volunteers will receive single ascending dose of IMP321&#xD;
      in each step (4 doses tested: 3, 10, 30 and 100 µg). In step 1, IMP321 will be given alone&#xD;
      and tested versus placebo (physiological saline). In step 2, the association IMP321 +&#xD;
      Agrippal (commercially available flu vaccine) will be tested versus Agrippal alone.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is divided in two steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1 (20 volunteers): IMP321 will be given alone and tested versus placebo (physiological&#xD;
      saline)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this first step, 4 group doses (of four subjects each) will be evaluated versus a placebo&#xD;
      group of 4 subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group IMP321 alone at 3 µg,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group IMP321 alone at 10 µg,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group IMP321 alone at 30 µg,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group IMP321 alone at 100 µg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to complete these groups, four successive cohorts of volunteers will be studied:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort A will correspond to the dose 3 µg and will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4 subjects treated by IMP321 3 µg alone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 subject treated by placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the tolerability of this cohort is acceptable, the following cohort will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort B will correspond to the dose 10 µg and will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4 subjects treated by IMP321 10 µg alone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 subject treated by placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the tolerability of this cohort is acceptable, the following cohort will be dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort C will correspond to the dose 30 µg and will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4 subjects treated by IMP321 30 µg alone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 subject treated by placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the tolerability of this cohort is acceptable, the following cohort will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort D will correspond to the dose 100 µg and will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4 subjects treated by IMP321 100 µg alone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 subject treated by placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2 (40 volunteers): The association IMP321 + Agrippal will be tested versus the Agrippal&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this second step, 4 group doses (of eight subjects each) will be evaluated versus a&#xD;
      reference group (Agrippal + physiological saline) of 8 subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group Agrippal + 3 µg of IMP321,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group Agrippal + 10 µg of IMP321,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group Agrippal + 30 µg of IMP321,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group Agrippal + 100 µg of IMP321.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to complete these groups, four successive cohorts of volunteers will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort A will correspond to the dose 3 µg of IMP321 and will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  8 subjects treated by Agrippal + IMP321 3 µg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 subjects treated by Agrippal + physiological saline&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the tolerability of this cohort is acceptable, the following cohort will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort B will correspond to the dose 10 µg of IMP321 and will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  8 subjects treated by Agrippal + IMP321 10 µg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 subjects treated by Agrippal + physiological saline&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the tolerability of this cohort is acceptable, the following cohort will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort C will correspond to the dose 30 µg of IMP321 and will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  8 subjects treated by Agrippal + IMP321 30 µg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 subjects treated by Agrippal + physiological saline&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the tolerability of this cohort is acceptable, the following cohort will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort D will correspond to the dose 100 µg of IMP321 and will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  8 subjects treated by Agrippal + IMP321 100 µg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 subjects treated by Agrippal + physiological saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a single centre, single blind, placebo (step 1) or reference (step 2)&#xD;
      randomised study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy young male volunteers will receive single ascending dose of IMP321 in each step.&#xD;
      Treatments will be administered as a subcutaneous injection on the mornings of Day 1. The&#xD;
      injection will be done subcutaneously (s.c.) in the deltoid area of the non dominant arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed by IMP321-specific ELISA testing of the&#xD;
      samples collected from the 4 volunteers receiving 100 µg IMP321 alone. Blood samples will be&#xD;
      taken on the morning of Day 1 before dosing then at 0.5, 1, 4, 24 and 48 h after dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples (for T cell assays) and serum samples (for hLAG-3Ig- and HA-specific antibody&#xD;
      detection by ELISA) will be taken on the morning of Days 1, 29 and 57.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring for the occurrence of adverse events (AE), changes in physical examination, vital&#xD;
      signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, respiration), electrocardiograms (ECG) and clinical&#xD;
      laboratory tests (biochemistry, haematology, urinalysis) will be performed before and after&#xD;
      each dose of the study drug to assess safety and tolerability.&#xD;
