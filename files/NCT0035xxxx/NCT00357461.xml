      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab, can block tumor growth in different&#xD;
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and&#xD;
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Vaccines made from gp100 peptides&#xD;
      may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Giving ipilimumab&#xD;
      together with vaccine therapy may be an effective treatment for melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying ipilimumab and vaccine therapy to see how&#xD;
      well they work compared to ipilimumab alone in treating patients with previously treated&#xD;
      stage IV melanoma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the impact of ipilimumab with vs without gp100 peptides emulsified with&#xD;
           Montanide ISA-51 on clinical response in patients with previously treated, HLA-A*0201&#xD;
           positive stage IV melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the safety/toxicity profile of these regimens in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the immunologic response, as measured by in vitro assays using peripheral&#xD;
           blood samples, in patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the response rate after a re-induction regimen for patients who have relapsed&#xD;
           after initial response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label study. Patients are stratified according to ECOG&#xD;
      performance status (0 vs 1 or 2) and metastases (M1a vs M1 b or M1c). Patients are randomized&#xD;
      to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Induction phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Arm I: Patients receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Arm II: Patients receive ipilimumab as in arm I. Patients also receive gp100&#xD;
                peptides emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously (SC) on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms, treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving stable disease or better for 12&#xD;
      weeks after 4 courses proceed to maintenance phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maintenance phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Arm I: Patients receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Arm II: Patients receive ipilimumab IV as in arm I and gp100 peptides emulsified in&#xD;
                Montanide ISA-51 SC on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment in both arms begins in approximately week 21 and repeats every 3 months for 8&#xD;
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who relapse&#xD;
      or progress while on maintenance phase undergo re-induction comprising 4 courses of treatment&#xD;
      with ipilimumab with or without gp100 peptides emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 as in induction&#xD;
      phase. Patients achieving responding disease (complete response, partial response, or stable&#xD;
      disease) for 12 weeks after re-induction proceed to the maintenance phase as above for up to&#xD;
      8 courses of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are evaluated for 3 weeks after the last&#xD;
      treatment, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 94 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
