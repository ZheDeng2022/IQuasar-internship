      Caregiver Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to have 1 interview. This will be&#xD;
      a face-to-face interview that will take place at M. D. Anderson while you are there for the&#xD;
      patient's physician appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this interview, you will be asked to describe what it has been like for you to help&#xD;
      care for a person with a primary brain tumor in the past, what it is like to care for a&#xD;
      person with a primary brain tumor now, and what you think it might be like in the future. You&#xD;
      will be interviewed alone, and your interview will be tape recorded and then written on&#xD;
      paper. The information that is gathered (the tape and the written information) will be kept&#xD;
      strictly confidential. The tapes and any paperwork will be kept in a locked box during and&#xD;
      after this study. The written information will be kept in password-protected computer files.&#xD;
      The researcher is the only person who will have access to the tapes. You will also be asked&#xD;
      to answer a questionnaire on paper. This questionnaire will ask specific personal&#xD;
      information, such as your age, occupation, and relationship to the patient. This&#xD;
      questionnaire will take about 5 minutes to complete. The entire interview will take about 30&#xD;
      minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation in this study will be over after you complete the interview and the&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 20 caregivers will take part in this study. All will&#xD;
      be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to choose a family member or a&#xD;
      friend who is your main caregiver and who may be willing to take part in 1 interview for this&#xD;
      study. Your consent in this study, will give researchers permission to contact your&#xD;
      caregiver. If your caregiver chooses to participate, the interview will be face-to-face, and&#xD;
      it will take place at M. D. Anderson while you are there for your physician appointment.&#xD;
      During this interview, the caregiver will be asked to describe what it has been like for them&#xD;
      to help care for you. The researcher will get informed consent from your caregiver and will&#xD;
      go into further detail about this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      He or she will be interviewed alone, and the information gathered during the interview will&#xD;
      be kept strictly confidential. Your caregiver will be asked to complete a questionnaire for&#xD;
      specific personal information, such as his or her age, occupation, and relationship to you.&#xD;
      The entire interview will take about 30 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked to allow your sociodemographic data (such as your gender, marital status,&#xD;
      etc.) and medical data (such as your diagnosis, therapies received, etc.) to be collected&#xD;
      from your medical record. This information will be used to help researchers learn about the&#xD;
      unique backgrounds of the patients participating in this study. Your information that is&#xD;
      gathered will be kept strictly confidential, and it will be kept in a locked box during and&#xD;
      after this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation in this study will be over after your sociodemographic and medical data&#xD;
      have been collected from your medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 20 patients will take part in this study. All will be&#xD;
      enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
