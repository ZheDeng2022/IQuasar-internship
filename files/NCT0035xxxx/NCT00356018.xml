    <textblock>
      To determine, in a randomized, parallel open-label fashion, compliance rates between&#xD;
      once-daily extended-release divalproex sodium tablets (Depakote-ER®, Abbott Labs) versus&#xD;
      multiple-daily dose valproic acid capsules (Depakene®, Abbott Labs) in an epilepsy&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      x_ Prospective x__ Single-center __ Multicenter x__ Open-label __ Double-blind __&#xD;
      Single-blind x_ Randomized (please provide randomization ratio): 1:1 This population includes&#xD;
      both patients whose seizures are relatively well- controlled on their present conventional,&#xD;
      enteric-coated, twice-daily or three-times daily Divalproex sodium (Depakote®, [DR]) regimen.&#xD;
      Patients on DR monotherapy are preferred, but not required. Partial onset seizures and&#xD;
      primarily generalized seizures will both be represented in this study. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized in 1:1 fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group #1: 10 patients will be randomized to IR-VPA, to be taken 3 to 4 times a day, in a&#xD;
      total daily dose equivalent to DR. The dosing regimen will likely be taken at meal times for&#xD;
      those receiving IR-VPA tid (not q 8 h), and additionally at bedtime for those on a QID (not q&#xD;
      6 h) regimen. The choice of TID vs QID regimen will be dictated by the patients' total daily&#xD;
      dose requirements, with the attempt to keep the number of 250 mg capsules identical for each&#xD;
      dose throughout the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group #2: 10 patients will be randomized to ER, to be taken once-daily in the AM or PM at the&#xD;
      investigator's discretion and patient's choice, since dosing ER in the AM or PM does not&#xD;
      substantially differ as to plasma VPA concentrations [17]. Once AM or PM once-daily ER dosing&#xD;
      is chosen for a patient, it will not be changed. ER once-daily dosing will incorporate the&#xD;
      recommended dose-proportional increase of 8-20% in total daily dose over that of DR for&#xD;
      patients with epilepsy (18). However, only one tablet strength (500 mg ER) will be utilized,&#xD;
      so total daily dose will be rounded to the nearest 500 mg increment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 20 patients should provide sufficient power (80%) to adequately detect a&#xD;
      statistically (p &lt; 0.05) and clinically meaningful change in compliance rate between the&#xD;
      groups, if one exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance and precision will both be measure in this short-term study. Compliance, defined&#xD;
      as the number of times the multiple-daily IR-VPA dose or ER dose was actually taken vs that&#xD;
      prescribed daily, will be tallied with a computer-chip recording device (MEMS unit [13]) and&#xD;
      via the patient's daily diary / calendar. Precision, defined as the actual time the daily&#xD;
      dose for ER was actually taken (or multiple-daily doses for IR-VPA were actually taken)&#xD;
      compared to the prescribed times ( + 15 min), as documented by the MEMS unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------------&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will take 3 months to recruit #20 patients according to our protocol. The total protocol&#xD;
      can last from 49 to 70 days. There will be up to a 21-day screening period per patient,&#xD;
      followed by a 7-day period for the patient to practice the MEMS unit and gain familiarity and&#xD;
      demonstrate competency with the device. After randomization at Day 0, there will be 42&#xD;
      consecutive days of prospective evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the end of study, the time to first abstract / manuscript submitted: 2 months&#xD;
      x__Abstract/manuscript/ poster assistance is anticipated&#xD;
&#xD;
      Washout period: N/A Screening Period: 0 to 21 days prior to baseline observation. Baseline&#xD;
      observation period: 7 days prior to randomization. This period allows the patient to practice&#xD;
      with the MEMS unit, gaining familiarity with it and demonstrating competency with the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment period: The treatment period is forty-two (# 42) days after Randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A rapid, immediate conversion from multiple-daily dosed DR to once-daily divalproex-ER has&#xD;
      been recommended for adults with epilepsy since it is a simple maneuver to understand with a&#xD;
      low predicted chance for side effects (19). Likewise, patients randomized to the IR-VPA group&#xD;
      will be immediately converted from DR to multiple-daily dose IR-VPA without tapering the DR&#xD;
      or gradual titration upward of IR-VPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taper period: N/A&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age: adults (16 and older) Gender: male/female Disease under study: Patients with a chronic,&#xD;
      yet relatively stable partial and /or generalized seizure disorder will be included in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty patients currently currently undergoing treatment with enteric-coated divalproex [DR]&#xD;
      for whom the treating physician elects to change to once-daily divalproex-ER will be&#xD;
      candidates for this study. Ten patients will be assigned to each group randomly, which should&#xD;
      yield sufficient power to make a definite statement regarding the best conversion strategy to&#xD;
      use in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XX__ Depakote® Tablets (for Lead-in) XX__ Depakote® ER&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No Drug Required __ Depakote® Sprinkle&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Depacon® XX_Depakene® Capsules Lead-in: Patients with epilepsy who are already being&#xD;
           treated with conventional, enteric-coated, delayed-release Depakote ([DR]). Patients on&#xD;
           DR monotherapy are preferred, but patients may be taking additional AEDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACTIVE: Depakote-ER. For those randomized to this group, an 8-20% mg dose increase will be&#xD;
      utilized in DR to ER conversion, as recommended by the Divalproex-ER package insert (Abbott)&#xD;
      and based upon published evidence for the need to compensate for the lesser bioavailability&#xD;
      of ER. Only 500 mg ER tablets will be used, such that total daily dose will be rounded to the&#xD;
      nearest 500 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACTIVE COMPARATOR: Depakene Capsules. Depakene is a liquid-filled capsule containing 250 mg&#xD;
      IR-VPA. The same total daily dose of IR-VPA as DR will be utilized. IR-VPA will be given TID&#xD;
      (not q 8 h) or QID (not q 6 h), depending upon which regimen allows for an identical number&#xD;
      of capsules to be given for each dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: Compliance and precision will only be recorded for either ER or IR-VPA, not for other&#xD;
      AEDS, in those patients who happen to be taking concomitant AEDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Patients, age 16 and above, currently taking Divalproex-DR for any seizure disorder; 2)&#xD;
      Other AEDs are permitted concurrently, although compliance with these will not be recorded.&#xD;
      Other medications for co-morbid disease are permitted, provided no plans for changes in&#xD;
      medications used for the treatment of the concomitant disorder are expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3) Patients must demonstrate a 75% or greater compliance rate with DR via calendar during the&#xD;
      week of familiarity with the MEMs unit. The threshold value of 75% has been chosen since&#xD;
      research shows that people take approximately 75% of their AED(s) as prescribed (13,14), and&#xD;
      the same numerical value is frequently used in determining whether or not to retain a patient&#xD;
      in clinical Phase 2a-3b industry-sponsored study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. patients with a recent history of status epilepticus;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. patients who have refractory or unstable epilepsy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. patients with acute illnesses requiring changes in concurrent drugs;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. patients unwilling to change from their present DR regimen to divalproex-ER or IR-VPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients unwilling or unable to utilize the MEMs monitoring unit;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Pregnant or lactating women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IRB approval will be sought. After the appropriate IRB approval, written, informed consent&#xD;
      will be obtained for all patients participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in either Group will be instructed to take their ER or IR-VPA according to the PI's&#xD;
      usual practice, without different or special coaching or prompting techniques to enhance&#xD;
      compliance throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be observed closely by physicians and allied health personnel on a weekly&#xD;
      basis, by actual visit to the study center (Days 0, +14, +28 &amp; +42 and via phone on Days +7,&#xD;
      +21 &amp; +35. Blood work, including CBC, platelet counts, LFTs, serum chemistry panel and total&#xD;
      valproate will be measured prior to and at the end of the study on Day +42&#xD;
      post-randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for premature discontinuation for safety reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients who pass screening but who do not demonstrate proficiency or competence with&#xD;
           the MEMs monitoring unit for the 7-day period prior to randomization;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients with a 50% increase in seizure frequency compared to their historic baseline,&#xD;
           or the development of seizures requiring hospitalization at any time during the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients with a clinically significant increase in the number or severity of AEs, as&#xD;
           determined by the investigator;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients with a MEMs (if data is immediately accessible and available) or&#xD;
           calendar-documented compliance rate of &lt; 35% at any time during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients with a MEMs (if data is immediately accessible and available) or&#xD;
           calendar-documented compliance rate between &gt; 35% and &lt; 75% on three separate occasions&#xD;
           or two consecutive occasions during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy parameter will be the difference in mean compliance rate (defined as the&#xD;
      # does taken divided by the # doses prescribed) for the ER vs IR-VPA group at Day + 42.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) The change in compliance rate from Day 0 to Day +42 will be compared for both groups; 2)&#xD;
      The precision of dose administration, determined by the number of doses administered within +&#xD;
      15 min of their assigned times will be compared for all dose times over the course of the&#xD;
      study between the two groups; 3) Drop out rates for both groups, due to lack of seizure&#xD;
      control, adverse effects or noncompliance, will be compared between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      x_Statistical analysis assistance may be required&#xD;
&#xD;
      None foreseen. Patients selected for this study will only be those who, upon recommendations&#xD;
      or orders from their physician, will be switched from multiple-daily dose of divalproex-DR to&#xD;
      the divalproex extended-release formulation, administered once-daily or to IR-VPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is considered &quot;research&quot; by virtue of the randomization of epilepsy patients to&#xD;
      two different groups, utilizing dosage formulations and regimens commonly encountered in&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;
