    <textblock>
      Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are isolated from the early human embryo and have the&#xD;
      capability to proliferate indefinitely in culture and to develop into nearly every cell of&#xD;
      the human body. hESC are important for studying developmental biology and for cell&#xD;
      replacement therapies for the treatment of degenerative human diseases. An additional use for&#xD;
      embryonic stem cells would be for the in vitro study of diseases. hESC lines derived from&#xD;
      embryos diagnosed as abnormal by PGD testing would afford such models for study. Because&#xD;
      embryos tested by PGD and found to be abnormal would only under rare circumstances be&#xD;
      transferred to the uterus of a woman (and in most cases would be discarded), the derivation&#xD;
      of new hESC lines from these embryos would provide a viable less ethically-objectionable&#xD;
      source of cells with which to study the mechanisms of differentiation and developmental&#xD;
      biology.&#xD;

      Embryonic stem cells are pluripotent cells that are derived from the early stage embryo (the&#xD;
      blastocyst stage). Embryonic stem cells are the only cells that have the ability to provide&#xD;
      an unlimited source of daughter cells and can differentiate into virtually any cell of the&#xD;
      body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human embryonic stem cell lines have previously been derived from supernumerary embryos&#xD;
      donated by couples undergoing IVF treatment. Thomson was the second in the world to isolate&#xD;
      human embryonic stem cells. We derived six human embryonic stem cell lines, which are&#xD;
      registered with the National Institute of Health and are eligible for American federal&#xD;
      funding for research. We are widely distributing our cell lines to many researchers&#xD;
      worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key features of human embryonic stem cells are their potential of unlimited proliferation&#xD;
      in culture, and their ability to differentiate into a large variety of somatic cells of the&#xD;
      body. Our group was the first to show this capability in culture (1). Our results, and the&#xD;
      results of other groups show that human embryonic stem cells can differentiate in culture&#xD;
      into nerve cells, blood cells, pancreatic cells that secrete insulin, heart muscle cells, and&#xD;
      others. Given the key properties of human embryonic stem cells, they are expected to have far&#xD;
      reaching applications in basic scientific research, development of new drugs, and may serve&#xD;
      as an unlimited donor source of cells for transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Embryonic stem cells will be recovered from human blastocysts donated to stem cell research&#xD;
      by couples that have undergone preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of their embryos&#xD;
      during IVF. In PGD, a number of embryos are generated by routine IVF, and cellular material&#xD;
      is then taken as a biopsy from early human embryos that have been cultured in vitro. Embryos&#xD;
      that are found to be genetically normal are selectively transferred to the uterus. A portion&#xD;
      of the tested embryos will not have a diagnosis or will be found to contain specific genetic&#xD;
      mutations or chromosomal aberrations. After discussion with the couple and subjected to their&#xD;
      consent, these embryos will not be implanted in the potential mother for the purposes of&#xD;
      pregnancy. It should be noted that in cases of uncertain diagnosis the couples may elect to&#xD;
      transfer the embryos and perform prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy termination in cases where&#xD;
      the fetus is found to be affected. Otherwise, the affected embryos or those without a certain&#xD;
      diagnosis are truly surplus embryos that are routinely discarded. We wish to derive human&#xD;
      embryonic stem cell lines from these embryos, since they will contain a specific mutation or&#xD;
      chromosomal aberration that will be of interest to the research community. The genetically&#xD;
      abnormal stem cells, that will be derived from these PGD-tested embryos, will be useful tools&#xD;
      for the investigation of early development, cell function, disease progression, and for the&#xD;
      efficacy or toxicity of drug therapies for the genetic abnormalities that they will carry.&#xD;
      Derivation of human ES cell lines that harbor a specific gene defect will have great&#xD;
      importance in the study and development of treatments for certain inheritable disorders. In&#xD;
      addition, they may be employed for the development of gene therapy strategies designed for&#xD;
      potential treatment of specific inherited disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should be stressed that the embryos that will be recruited for this study would have been&#xD;
      discarded in any event, and would not have been implanted to produce a child. The embryos,&#xD;
      while precious, will contain or will be suspected to contain undesired chromosomal or single&#xD;
      gene defects, and will not have been deemed acceptable for transfer by the couple undergoing&#xD;
      IVF. By contrast, these embryos, while not suitable for the purposes of producing healthy&#xD;
      offspring, are valuable to stem cell research as key tools for the study of specific human&#xD;
      disorders, therapies, for the investigation of early human development, in the derivation of&#xD;
      new medications to treat diseases, and possibly to correct genetic defects. Rather than&#xD;
      simply discarding and destroying the stem cells within these faulty embryos, they will be&#xD;
      salvaged and utilized in the derivation of new disease-specific human embryonic stem cell&#xD;
      lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the new lines derived from PGD embryos will be utilized for research purposes only, the&#xD;
      derivation of new embryonic stem cell lines will occur under GLP conditions, utilizing&#xD;
      predetermined acceptable raw materials and methods. These lines may be characterized and&#xD;
      safety tested like the non-PGD-tested lines after manufacturing in the Research and&#xD;
      Development Laboratory of the Goldyne Savad Institute of Gene Therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PGD-tested embryos will be obtained under full informed consent prior to their&#xD;
      utilization in research. Voluntary donations of embryos will be recruited, in accordance with&#xD;
      existing regulations and legislation. The donors will be approached only after the decision&#xD;
      to discard the genetically abnormal embryos has been independently made. IVF staff will&#xD;
      approach the donors, answer any questions they may have, and obtain their permission prior to&#xD;
      utilization of their embryos. Because of the many ethical concerns regarding the removal of&#xD;
      fetal cells from human embryos, we are extremely sensitive to the moral debates as to the&#xD;
      &quot;rights&quot; and the &quot;personage&quot; of an embryo. Once obtained, the embryos will be developed to&#xD;
      the blastocyst stage and the stem cells removed, according to accepted protocols for human&#xD;
      embryonic stem cell line development. No identifiable features of the donor couple, exclusive&#xD;
      of the known genetic mutation, will be attached to any of the embryos donated to research.&#xD;
