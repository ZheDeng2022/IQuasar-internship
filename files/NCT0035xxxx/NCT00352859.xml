    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if taking interferon or gemcitabine along with sorafenib&#xD;
      will stop the advanced renal cell cancer from becoming worse in some people. To do this,&#xD;
      sorafenib along with gemcitabine or interferon will be compared to treatment with gemcitabine&#xD;
      or interferon alone. More safety information on sorafenib will be also collected. About 260&#xD;
      patients with progressed renal cell cancer will be in this study.&#xD;
