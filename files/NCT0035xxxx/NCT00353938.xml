      This study will examine MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in individuals aged 18 years or older&#xD;
      diagnosed with PTSD, with PTSD symptoms not improving after trying at least one treatment.&#xD;
      This objective of this study is to determine whether three eight-hour long sessions of&#xD;
      MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, scheduled three to five weeks apart, can be safely administered&#xD;
      to participants with PTSD, and whether combining a fully therapeutic dose of MDMA with&#xD;
      psychotherapy, when compared with a low (&quot;active placebo&quot;) dose of MDMA, will reduce PTSD&#xD;
      symptoms. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive the full dose of MDMA (125 mg) or&#xD;
      assigned to receive a low or &quot;active placebo&quot; dose of MDMA (25 mg) during each of three&#xD;
      experimental sessions.&#xD;

      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) occurs after experiencing a traumatic event or events.&#xD;
      PTSD is a public health problem that causes a great deal of suffering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in individuals aged 18 years or older&#xD;
      diagnosed with PTSD, with PTSD symptoms not improving after trying at least one treatment.&#xD;
      This objective of this study is to determine whether three eight-hour long sessions of&#xD;
      MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, scheduled three to five weeks apart, can be safely administered&#xD;
      to participants with PTSD, and whether combining a fully therapeutic dose of MDMA with&#xD;
      psychotherapy, when compared with a low (&quot;active placebo&quot;) dose of MDMA, will reduce PTSD&#xD;
      symptoms. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive the full dose of MDMA (125 mg) or&#xD;
      assigned to receive a low or &quot;active placebo&quot; dose of MDMA (25 mg) during each of three&#xD;
      experimental sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People who receive the low dose of MDMA have the opportunity to take part in a second &quot;open&#xD;
      label&quot; study continuation, wherein the participants will undergo three MDMA-assisted&#xD;
      sessions, with the participant and the researchers knowing that a full dose of MDMA is being&#xD;
      administered. People who receive the full dose of MDMA, and any person who received low-dose&#xD;
      MDMA and does not undergo the open-label study continuation will have PTSD symptoms measured&#xD;
      six and twelve months after the third session. People who take part in the open label study&#xD;
      continuation have their PTSD symptoms assessed six and 12 months after the third Phase II&#xD;
      MDMA-assisted session.&#xD;

    <description>The CAPS-IV is a structured clinical interview designed to assess the symptoms and severity of PTSD. The CAPS-IV provides a means to evaluate the frequency and intensity dimensions of each symptom, the impact of symptoms on the patient's social and occupational functioning, the overall severity of the symptom complex, global improvement since baseline, and the validity of the ratings obtained. Total severity scores range from 0 to 136, with higher scores indicating greater severity of PTSD symptoms.</description>

    <description>The Posstraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale (PSD) is a 49-item self-report instrument to aid in the diagnosis of PTSD. Questions are asked about symptoms experienced and participants respond on a scale from 0 (&quot;not at all or only one time&quot;) to 3 (&quot;5 or more times a week/almost always&quot;). Items are summed to create a total score that ranges from 0 to 51, with higher scores indicating more PTSD symptoms.</description>

        <description>The CAPS-IV is a structured clinical interview designed to assess the symptoms and severity of PTSD. The CAPS-IV provides a means to evaluate the frequency and intensity dimensions of each symptom, the impact of symptoms on the patient's social and occupational functioning, the overall severity of the symptom complex, global improvement since baseline, and the validity of the ratings obtained. Total severity scores range from 0 to 136, with higher scores indicating greater severity of PTSD symptoms.</description>
