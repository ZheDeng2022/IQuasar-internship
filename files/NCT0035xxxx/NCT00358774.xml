  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Common colds affect many people and are the cause of bothersome symptoms such as runny or&#xD;
      stuffy nose, sore throat, headache and sneezing. Common colds can also cause more severe&#xD;
      illnesses in certain groups of people like the elderly, people with chronic lung diseases&#xD;
      such as asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to test whether a non-drug (homeopathic) nasal spray will reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of colds, decrease cold related symptoms or shorten the length of the cold.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Common colds are the most frequent type of respiratory infection, and although the clinical&#xD;
      manifestations are usually not life threatening or debilitating, they cause annoying symptoms&#xD;
      such as nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, malaise, sore throat and sneezing, that can interfere&#xD;
      with activities of daily living. Furthermore, colds can cause more severe illnesses in&#xD;
      certain people including: infants, the elderly, and people with asthma, chronic lung&#xD;
      diseases, or immune deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial is designed to test whether a new homeopathic formulation has beneficial&#xD;
      effects on the management of common colds that have been induced by inoculation of rhinovirus&#xD;
      into the nose of healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this research clinical study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      homeopathic nasal formulation for the management of experimentally-induced common colds as&#xD;
      indicated by a reduction in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cold incidence compared to placebo,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptom severity compared to placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cold duration compared to placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infection rate compared to placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of virus shedding compared to placebo or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Amount of virus shedding compared to placebo&#xD;
