      The primary objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 identify and compare the experiences of minority and nonminority caregivers, including&#xD;
      the prevalence and severity of physical (fatigue, sleep disturbance) and psychologic&#xD;
      (depression, anxiety, stress) symptoms and their influence on caregiver symptom burden; and&#xD;
      to&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 assess the relationship between caregiver's symptoms (physical and psychologic) and the&#xD;
      patient's symptom's at multiple time points over the patient's treatment regimen for advanced&#xD;
      solid tumors (lung, breast, cervical, and others).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary objective is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 describe the experience of being a minority (African American/Black or Latino) or&#xD;
      nonminority person caring for a medically underserved patient with advanced solids tumors&#xD;
      (lung, breast, cervical, or others) over the course of the patient's treatment regimen and&#xD;
      follow-up clinic visits.&#xD;

      Caregiver:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you choose to take part in this study, you will be asked to complete 3 study visits over a&#xD;
      period of about 20 weeks (the first visit, followed by 2 more visits, usually 3-8 weeks&#xD;
      apart). During the first and third visits, you will be asked to take part in an interview&#xD;
      that will include questions about your experience as a caregiver to a patient with cancer.&#xD;
      The interview will last about 30-45 minutes and will be tape recorded. The text of the&#xD;
      interviews will be copied from the tapes to a written format. The study staff will review the&#xD;
      content to look for key caregiver concerns and experiences. The PI and study staff will be&#xD;
      the only ones who will have access to the tapes and transcripts. All tapes will be destroyed&#xD;
      after the study is finished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also be asked to complete some brief surveys about your physical and psychological&#xD;
      health, your reactions to being a caregiver, and your beliefs about symptoms and their&#xD;
      control. It will take about 30-45 minutes to complete the surveys, each time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study visit will take about 60-90 minutes. If you can not come to the clinic, trained&#xD;
      research study staff will contact you by telephone or by a home visit (with your permission)&#xD;
      to complete the surveys and interview. After the last of the 3 study visits, your&#xD;
      participation will be ended in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 125 participants will take part in this multicenter&#xD;
      study at 4 sites: Lyndon Baines Johnson Hospital, Ben Taub General Hospital, MD Anderson, and&#xD;
      locations in the community identified by the participant and the study team. Up to 40 will be&#xD;
      enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
