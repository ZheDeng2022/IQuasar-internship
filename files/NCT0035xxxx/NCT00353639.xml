  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate and compare the genes of the telomere repair complex in healthy&#xD;
      control subjects, patients with blood diseases, and patients with inflammatory bowel disease&#xD;
      to identify what, if any, changes are associated specifically with inflammatory bowel&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients between 2 and 80 years of age with ulcerative colitis or regional enteritis may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Participants are recruited from the practice of Dr. Stuart&#xD;
      Danovitch, Washington, D.C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers have established that minor differences in a specific set of genes called the&#xD;
      telomere repair complex are related to immune-mediated diseases of the bone marrow. NIH&#xD;
      researchers are now interested in whether inflammatory bowel disease and other autoimmune&#xD;
      diseases show a similar pattern of genetic differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants provide a cell sample for evaluation of the telomere repair complex. The sample&#xD;
      is collected via buccal swab, a gentle scraping of the inside of the cheek, and stored for&#xD;
      use in research.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We have identified inherited mutations in genes of the telomere repair complex in patients&#xD;
      with acquired aplastic anemia. These mutations diminish the ability of cells to repair the&#xD;
      ends of chromosomes, called telomeres, which normally shorten with each cell division.&#xD;
      Mutations in TERC, the gene which encodes for the RNA template of the complex; in TERT, the&#xD;
      gene for the enzyme in the complex, and also in the Schwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome gene&#xD;
      (SBDS), which we believe to be associated with telomere repair, lead to reduced telomerase&#xD;
      activity, diminished numbers of hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow, and presumably also a&#xD;
      deficiency in the ability of cells to respond to immunological attack and destruction of the&#xD;
      hematopoietic system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This laboratory research protocol will allow us to evaluate whether similar gene mutations&#xD;
      might underlie other autoimmune diseases, here specifically, inflammatory bowel disease,&#xD;
      which share broad pathophysiologic features with immune-mediated aplastic anemia. We will&#xD;
      directly assess by DNA sequencing suspect genes (TERC, TERT, SBDS, DNA helicases and others)&#xD;
      in buccal mucosal samples obtained from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).&#xD;
      Analyses from large numbers of controls have defined polymorphisms for these genes. IBD&#xD;
      samples will allow us to determine whether mutations in these genes are more prevalent in&#xD;
      this patient population and to test the hypotheses that telomere repair defects underlie&#xD;
      human autoimmunity, or that these genes are specifically involved in hematology as risks&#xD;
      factors for bone marrow failure.&#xD;
