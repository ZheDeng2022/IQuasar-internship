  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective chart review. We hypothesize that patients who have undergone&#xD;
      congenital heart surgery, prior to screening of blood products have a significant risk of&#xD;
      hepatitis C infection and all such patients would benefit from screening for hepatitis C.&#xD;

      The Adult Congenital Clinic at Emory Hospital routinely screens all patients who have had&#xD;
      congenital heart surgery prior to 1992 for hepatitis C antibodies. It is currently not the&#xD;
      practice norm for all congenital heart patients to receive hepatitis screening unless they&#xD;
      are at a specialized clinic that has implemented a system. The question of hepatitis C&#xD;
      serology is particularly important for this population as many of these patients develop&#xD;
      heart failure and may require heart transplantation and immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a retrospective analysis examining the prevalence of hepatitis C in the Adult&#xD;
      Congenital Clinic at The Emory Clinic. The current practice is to screen all adult congenital&#xD;
      heart disease patients for hepatitis C. All Emory clinic charts reviewed will be of patients&#xD;
      who had congenital heart surgery. Only information on patients who had surgery prior to 1992&#xD;
      will be used for this study. We will review approximately 1000 charts for this study.&#xD;
