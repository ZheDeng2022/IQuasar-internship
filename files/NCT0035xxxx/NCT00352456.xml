      This study is directed toward a better understanding of how the brain regulates emotions and&#xD;
      social and antisocial behavior. It will look at the use of the orbital frontal cortex and&#xD;
      amygdala of the brain. Brain changes are involved in solving conflicts and the feelings that&#xD;
      such conflicts produce. Conflicts may occur with other people or with general social rules.&#xD;
      The researchers' expectations are that the findings will be useful in developing therapies&#xD;
      that may improve people's ability to solve social conflicts and reduce antisocial behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 20 to 50 years of age with psychopathy and a second set of comparison adults, all&#xD;
      of whom have been released from the Fairfax County Adult Detention Center, may be eligible&#xD;
      for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neurocognitive component of the study, the one pertaining to performance of various&#xD;
      tasks, will involve 20 adults with psychopathy and 20 comparison adults. The neuroimaging&#xD;
      component, in which a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is used, will involve 18 adults&#xD;
      and 18 comparison adults. Two visits by participants will be entailed. At the first visit,&#xD;
      patients will undergo the following procedures and tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test of vital signs, lying and standing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of blood for chemistry and hematology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urinalysis and liver function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screen for HIV and hepatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test, if applicable, at the first visit and at all further visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on the group to which they are assigned, at the second visit, patients will undergo&#xD;
      an MRI scan or take part in a variety of computer-based tasks to measure different forms of&#xD;
      thinking skills, emotional responses, and decision making. During the MRI scan, patients will&#xD;
      lie still on a table that will slide into the enclosed tunnel of the MRI scanner. They will&#xD;
      be asked to lie as still as possible. As the scanner takes pictures, patients will hear&#xD;
      knocking or beeping sounds, and they will wear earplugs to reduce the noise. Patients will be&#xD;
      able to communicate with the MRI staff at all times during the scan, and they may ask to be&#xD;
      moved out of the machine at any time. While lying in the MRI scanner, patients will be asked&#xD;
      to perform tasks presented via a screen. These tasks will involve looking at pictures or&#xD;
      words, and patients will be asked to make decisions about the pictures. The MRI scan will&#xD;
      take no more than 2 hours. In regard to the computer-based tasks that participants will&#xD;
      perform, the tasks are often games presented on a computer. Via computer, or on paper, there&#xD;
      may be presentations of pictures that bring about an emotion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no direct treatment or therapeutic benefits to participation in this study.&#xD;
      However, the knowledge gained may help people in the future.&#xD;

      The Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (Hare, 1991) allows the identification of a relatively&#xD;
      homogeneous population of individuals who present with marked emotional dysfunction (reduced&#xD;
      empathy, guilt and attachment to others) as well as a notable propensity for goal-directed&#xD;
      antisocial behavior. Identification of the neuro-biological underpinnings of their emotional&#xD;
      dysfunction is of crucial importance as the level of emotion dysfunction is an important&#xD;
      predictor of long term prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are two main positions regarding the neural systems that are dysfunctional&#xD;
      in individuals with psychopathy: First, that the pathology is associated with amygdala&#xD;
      dysfunction; Secondly, that the pathology is associated with orbital frontal cortex&#xD;
      dysfunction. A third, more recent position, stresses the interconnections between these two&#xD;
      systems and the role that development may play in the disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current project will determine the performance of individuals with psychopathy and&#xD;
      comparison individuals on measures which recruit the amygdala and orbital frontal cortex. In&#xD;
      addition, a series of functional neuro-imaging studies will directly assess neural responses&#xD;
      in these two systems in individuals with psychopathy. Finally, a structural imaging study&#xD;
      will examine anatomical differences between the groups. The project should provide clear data&#xD;
      that will constrain future theorizing on the pathology implicated in this disorder.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Psychopathy:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. Comparison individuals: All individuals will score less than 20 on the&#xD;
                       PCL-R.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. Individuals with psychopathy: All individuals will score more than 30 on the&#xD;
                       PCL-R (participants scoring between 21-29 are excluded from study&#xD;
                       participation).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Age: Participants will be males and females, 20-50 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. IQ: IQ, as measured by 4 subscales from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence&#xD;
                  Scale-Revised (WAIS-R), must be greater than 80.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Medication status: No current use of any psychotropic medication or&#xD;
                  benzodiazepine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Because factors such as psychiatric disease, or CNS disease, can influence functional brain&#xD;
        activity, these factors are exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Psychiatric history: Participants will be assessed using DSM-IV criteria via&#xD;
             standardized psychiatric interviews conducted by trained examiners (i.e., SCID).&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Comparison individuals: All participants will be free of any current or past&#xD;
                  psychiatric disorder. Participants will be excluded if they meet criteria for&#xD;
                  substance dependence but not if they meet criteria for substance abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Individuals with psychopathy: It is to be expected that the individuals with&#xD;
                  psychopathy will meet diagnostic criteria for Antisocial Personality Disorder&#xD;
                  and, in childhood, would have met criteria for Conduct Disorder, Oppositional&#xD;
                  Defiant Disorder and probably Attentional Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder. Any&#xD;
                  other current or past psychiatric disorder will be exclusory. Participants will&#xD;
                  be excluded if they meet criteria for substance dependence but not if they meet&#xD;
                  criteria for substance abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Severe acute and chronic medical illnesses. In short, any condition requiring the&#xD;
             administration of systemic drugs will be exclusory.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. CNS disease: history of brain abnormalities (e.g., neoplasms, subarachnoid cysts),&#xD;
             cerebrovascular disease, infectious disease (e.g., abscess), or other neurological&#xD;
             disease, or history of head trauma (defined as loss of consciousness greater than 3&#xD;
             min).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Metal or electronic objects: Metal plates, certain types of dental braces, cardiac&#xD;
             pacemakers, etc., that are sensitive to electromagnetic fields contraindicate MRI&#xD;
             scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Claustrophobia: participants will be questioned about potential discomfort in being in&#xD;
             an enclosed space, such as an MRI scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. There will be no exclusion criteria as regards type of crime. While there is some&#xD;
             increase in risk to testers in having participants who have committed acts of&#xD;
             violence, it is not extreme as long as the participants are appropriately treated.&#xD;
             Indeed, in our previous work almost all of our participants (comparison individuals&#xD;
             and individuals with psychopathy) were murderers.&#xD;
