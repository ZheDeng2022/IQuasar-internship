  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This a comparative study of enhanced pharmacist care and regular care of patients starting on&#xD;
      antidepressants. When providing participants with enhanced care pharmacists will use the&#xD;
      Health Professional's Antidepressant Communications Tool (Health PACT) a minimum of three&#xD;
      times during face-to-face discussions. This tool was developed specifically for this study.&#xD;
      All participants will be followed for 26 weeks and will be assessed for duration of use of&#xD;
      their antidepressant, adherence to treatment, and clinical response.&#xD;

      This proposal describes a combined observational study (Phase I) and randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial (Phase II). The primary aim of the observational study is to determine the disorders,&#xD;
      in particular the types of depression, for which family physicians prescribe antidepressants.&#xD;
      The primary aim of the randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to compare the effect of a brief&#xD;
      psycho-educational intervention by pharmacists with usual care on antidepressant persistence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects (n=621 phase 1, n=106 phase 2) will be patients presenting to a pharmacy in Edmonton&#xD;
      with a prescription for an antidepressant from a family physician and meeting the following&#xD;
      criteria: no antidepressants taken in the preceding six months; 18 years of age or older, and&#xD;
      fluent in English. Subjects will be interviewed using modified versions of the depression,&#xD;
      generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder sections of the Diagnostic Interview&#xD;
      Schedule; the Beck Depression Inventory; the Beck Anxiety Inventory; and a question on recent&#xD;
      stressful life events. For Phase 1 the proportion of subjects with the following DSM-IV&#xD;
      diagnoses will be estimated: major depression, &quot;minor depression,&quot; generalized anxiety&#xD;
      disorder, panic disorder; minor depression will be categorized into &quot;adjustment disorder with&#xD;
      depressed mood&quot; and &quot;adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood&quot;. The family&#xD;
      doctor will be contacted and asked for the diagnosis that prompted the antidepressant&#xD;
      prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with DSM IV depression will be invited to participate in Phase 2. Individuals will&#xD;
      be randomized to a pharmacist intervention with the Health PACT, or to usual care. Using the&#xD;
      newly-developed Antidepressant Compliance Questionnaire, information on predictors of&#xD;
      adherence will be collected at the baseline interview. At weeks 4, 8, 16 and 26, subjects&#xD;
      will be contacted by phone and questioned on antidepressant adherence and persistence. At&#xD;
      week 8 (or the exit interview if a subject leaves the study early), we will administer the&#xD;
      Beck Depression Inventory and the Beck Anxiety Inventory. The primary outcome is treatment&#xD;
      persistence, defined as the time to stop antidepressant use. Adherence, defined by the&#xD;
      medication possession ratio (MPR), will be also be measured.&#xD;
