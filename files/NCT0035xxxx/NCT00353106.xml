      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To explore the experience of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) following&#xD;
           allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation from the perspective of the patient and the&#xD;
           patient's primary family caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To develop and validate an instrument to measure the severity of multiple symptoms and&#xD;
           the impact of these symptoms on daily functioning in patients who have cGVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To develop a detailed description of the experience of having cGVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To develop a detailed description of the symptom experience of cGVHD to allow for&#xD;
           development of a symptoms instrument for cGVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the understanding of questions to measure the symptoms of cGVHD in patients&#xD;
           with various levels of education.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To develop a detailed description of caring for a patient with cGVHD.&#xD;

      For Patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to take part in 1 interview.&#xD;
      During the interview, you will be asked to describe what it has been like for you to have&#xD;
      chronic GVHD. In addition, if you agree to take part in this study, your family caregiver, if&#xD;
      you have one, will be approached to take part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Caregiver:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to take part in 1 interview.&#xD;
      During the interview, you will be asked to describe what it has been like for you to help&#xD;
      care for a family member with chronic GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both Parties:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interview face-to-face will take place while you are at M. D. Anderson receiving care.&#xD;
      You will be interviewed alone and the information gathered during the interview will be&#xD;
      strictly confidential. The interview will take about 30 minutes and will be tape recorded.&#xD;
      The audiotape of the interview will be kept in a locked cabinet in the office of the study&#xD;
      chairperson Dr. Loretta Williams. If other study personnel need the tape for analysis, they&#xD;
      must obtain the tape directly from Dr. Williams. They may keep the tape only while they are&#xD;
      listening to it and must return it immediately to Dr. Williams. Identification labels on the&#xD;
      tape will only contain your study number and will not contain your name, medical record&#xD;
      number, or other identifying information. When all analysis for the study has been completed&#xD;
      and reported, the audiotape will be destroyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the interview, you will be asked to answer a face-to-face questionnaire. This&#xD;
      questionnaire will ask descriptive personal information (age, marital status, etc.).&#xD;
      Answering these questions should take about 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on this study ends after you complete the interview and questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. About 20 patients and 20 caregivers will take part in this&#xD;
      study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Patient - Phase III:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to complete 1 questionnaire. The&#xD;
      questionnaire will have questions asking you to rate how severe your current symptoms are and&#xD;
      how much these symptoms disrupt your daily activities. You will be asked to complete this&#xD;
      questionnaire during your clinic visit. The questionnaire will take no more than 10 minutes&#xD;
      to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you have chronic graft-versus-host disease, you will be asked to complete a second&#xD;
      questionnaire about your opinion of the symptom questionnaire (the first questionnaire). For&#xD;
      example, you will be asked if the symptom questionnaire was easy to understand and to&#xD;
      complete. Learning your opinion about this questionnaire will help researchers learn what&#xD;
      important questions may be missing from the questionnaire. The questionnaire will take no&#xD;
      more than 10 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you have chronic graft-versus-host disease, you will also be given questions asking you to&#xD;
      rate the overall quality of your life and your ability to function. These ratings should take&#xD;
      no more than 2 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, you will be asked to answer a questionnaire. This questionnaire will ask descriptive&#xD;
      personal information (such as age and marital status). Answering these questions should take&#xD;
      about 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you have chronic GVHD, you may be asked to fill out the questionnaire rating your symptoms&#xD;
      1 more time, about 3 days after you completed it the first time. You will return this second&#xD;
      questionnaire to the research staff in a pre-addressed, stamped envelope given to you by the&#xD;
      research staff. If you are asked to complete the questionnaire this second time, the research&#xD;
      staff will also ask for your telephone number so that they may contact you and remind you to&#xD;
      complete the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification labels on all study questionnaires and forms will only contain your study&#xD;
      number and will not contain your name, medical record number, or other identifying&#xD;
      information. All study materials will be kept in a locked cabinet at all times. When all&#xD;
      analysis for the study has been completed and reported, the questionnaires will be destroyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study ends when you have completed the questionnaires, rating scales, and interview in&#xD;
      the clinic, or when you have completed and returned the second questionnaire 3 days after&#xD;
      your clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 192 patients will take part in this study. 147 will&#xD;
      be enrolled at M. D. Anderson and 45 will be enrolled at Roswell Park Cancer Institute.&#xD;
