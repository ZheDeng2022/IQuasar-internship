  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with asthma may have asthma worsening when they have an upper respiratory infection&#xD;
      due to a virus or a common cold. Leukotrienes are increased in nasal secretions from children&#xD;
      with Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and lung washings during times of acute lung&#xD;
      inflammation. Experimental virus exposure in adults is also associated with increases in&#xD;
      nasal leukotrienes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The degree to which leukotrienes play a role in asthma worsening is unknown.There is&#xD;
      information linking leukotrienes to viral infections, allergic inflammation, and asthma&#xD;
      exacerbation.This information supports the hypothesis that virus-induced leukotrienes&#xD;
      contribute to the severity of respiratory infections and in susceptible individuals, lead to&#xD;
      lower airway obstruction and exacerbations of asthma. We propose to use montelukast in an&#xD;
      experimental viral challenge model to explore this hypothesis.&#xD;

      Viral infections are important causes of wheezing illnesses throughout childhood and in&#xD;
      adults with asthma. There has been progress in identifying mechanisms and risk factors for&#xD;
      severe respiratory symptoms, and in particular, wheezing. Given this close relationship, it&#xD;
      would be attractive to apply antiviral strategies to the prevention and treatment of asthma,&#xD;
      and both RV and RSV are obvious targets. Unfortunately, attempts at developing an RSV vaccine&#xD;
      have so far been unsuccessful, and vaccination to prevent RV infection does not seem to be&#xD;
      feasible due to the large number of serotypes. Antiviral medications have been tested in&#xD;
      clinical trials, however one problem with this approach is that once the clinical signs and&#xD;
      symptoms appear, viral replication is well underway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other potential therapeutic approach for respiratory viral infections would be to&#xD;
      selectively inhibit pro-inflammatory immune responses induced by the virus. The beneficial&#xD;
      effects of systemic glucocorticoids indicate that this approach is valid; the challenge will&#xD;
      be to develop treatments with greater efficacy and a reduced potential for adverse effects.&#xD;
      The large body of information linking cysteinyl leukotrienes to viral infections, allergic&#xD;
      inflammation, and asthma exacerbations, strongly supports the hypothesis that virus-induced&#xD;
      leukotrienes contribute to the severity of respiratory infections and in susceptible&#xD;
      individuals, lead to lower airway obstruction and exacerbations of asthma. We propose to use&#xD;
      montelukast in an experimental viral challenge model to explore this hypothesis.&#xD;

    <measure>Mean Asthma Symptom Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>Asthma symptom scores were assessed twice per day with subjects completing a validated daytime diary card before bed and a nocturnal diary card on awakening. Subjects answered 4 questions about their asthma symptoms (0, none of the time; 6, all of the time). Daily score were calculated as the average of the 4 questions and an overall score for the week was assessed as the average of the daily scores. Time frame measurement was Day 7.</description>

    <measure>Peak Viral Shedding</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Viral shedding was measured in both groups. Viral titers from nasal lavage were calculated after 4 tissue culture tubes containing WI38 cells (human lung diploid cells) were inoculated for each serial 10-fold dilution of samples and incubated while rolling at 33 degrees Celsius for 10 days (measurement for analysis was taken at baseline and 7 days). Tubes were read at baseline and 7 days later. TCID50 was calculated as the concentration that was capable of infecting 50% of the tubes. Viral titers are expressed as TCID50 per milliliter. Time frame measurement was at baseline and 7 days.</description>

    <measure>Sputum Eosinophil Count</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Sputum was collected from both groups over 14 days after inoculation with the cold virus. Cell counts and differentials were made from sputum samples after treatment with 0.1% dithiothreitol. Eosinophils were counted and are expressed as as percentage of cells (percent of the total number counted) at the 14 day timepoint.</description>

        <title>Peak Viral Shedding</title>
        <description>Viral shedding was measured in both groups. Viral titers from nasal lavage were calculated after 4 tissue culture tubes containing WI38 cells (human lung diploid cells) were inoculated for each serial 10-fold dilution of samples and incubated while rolling at 33 degrees Celsius for 10 days (measurement for analysis was taken at baseline and 7 days). Tubes were read at baseline and 7 days later. TCID50 was calculated as the concentration that was capable of infecting 50% of the tubes. Viral titers are expressed as TCID50 per milliliter. Time frame measurement was at baseline and 7 days.</description>

        <description>Sputum was collected from both groups over 14 days after inoculation with the cold virus. Cell counts and differentials were made from sputum samples after treatment with 0.1% dithiothreitol. Eosinophils were counted and are expressed as as percentage of cells (percent of the total number counted) at the 14 day timepoint.</description>
