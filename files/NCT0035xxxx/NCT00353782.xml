  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate people with dyslipidemias - disorders that affect the fat content in&#xD;
      the blood. Fats, or lipids, such as cholesterol and triglycerides, are carried in the blood&#xD;
      in particles called lipoproteins. These particles are involved in causing blood vessel&#xD;
      diseases that can lead to conditions like atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) or&#xD;
      heart attack. Participants will undergo accepted medical tests and procedures to evaluate&#xD;
      their condition. Most of the test results are helpful in making a diagnosis and in guiding&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with lipid disorders are eligible for this study. Representative types of patients&#xD;
      include those with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plasma cholesterol levels greater than 200 mg/dl or less than 120 mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plasma LDL-C levels greater than 130 mg/dl or less than 70 mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plasma HDL-C levels greater than 70 mg/dl or less than 25 mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unusual cholesterol deposits or xanthomas (nodules of lipid deposits on the skin)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children under 2 years of age are excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo some or all of the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plasma evaluation. Apolipoproteins (plasma proteins involved in metabolism of&#xD;
           cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids, and proteins in the blood) and enzymes&#xD;
           involved in lipid metabolism are measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fat biopsy. A small sample of fat tissue is collected for examination. For this test, an&#xD;
           area on the buttock or abdominal wall is numbed. A needle is inserted into the fat, and&#xD;
           a small amount of tissue is sucked out by a syringe.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Leukapheresis. White blood cells are collected to help diagnose the lipid disorder. For&#xD;
           this test, blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein, similar to donating&#xD;
           blood. The blood circulates through a machine that separates it into its components, and&#xD;
           the white cells are removed. The rest of the blood is returned to the body, either&#xD;
           through the same needle or through another needle in the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin biopsy. Skin cells are collected for study. The cells are grown in the laboratory&#xD;
           and the amount of cholesterol that enters or leaves the cells is measured, providing&#xD;
           information on abnormalities in cholesterol transport. For this test, an area of skin is&#xD;
           numbed with an anesthetic and a small circular area is removed, using a skin punch&#xD;
           instrument similar to a sharp cookie cutter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heparin infusion study. Heparin, a blood thinner, releases enzymes that break down fat&#xD;
           in the blood. Lipase activity (breakdown of fats) in the blood is measured following the&#xD;
           injection of heparin into a vein.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The lipoprotein transport system is vital to the delivery of the hydrophobic fats that are&#xD;
      carried in the aqueous environment of the blood. The lipoprotein particles that comprise this&#xD;
      system are polydisperse and contain triglycerides, free and esterified cholesterol,&#xD;
      phospholipids and proteins. Inborn errors in the lipoprotein transport system lead to&#xD;
      alterations in both the steady state concentrations of the various lipoproteins and in the&#xD;
      metabolism of these particles. These inborn errors lead to both hyperlipoproteinemia and&#xD;
      hypolipoproteinemia. Profound changes in the ambient lipoprotein concentrations have a&#xD;
      variety of clinical manifestations. The present study protocol is designed to permit a full&#xD;
      plasma evaluation of the lipids, lipoproteins and apolipoproteins, in patients with potential&#xD;
      genetic defects in these processes. We will use a variety of research plasma assays. These&#xD;
      specialized plasma assays are necessary to correctly diagnose and treat patients that present&#xD;
      with the more unusual disorders of lipid metabolism; these patients cannot be diagnosed by&#xD;
      standard, CLIA- Certified assays and may require tissue or blood cells for diagnosis and&#xD;
      adequate treatment. The study population will include patients which are referred to the&#xD;
      Lipid Service, Cardiovascular Branch, NHLBI from private care providers, academic&#xD;
      institutions or the NHLBI-MDB website, with any of the following potential lipid&#xD;
      abnormalities or clinical stigmata associated with dyslipoproteinemias: a) increased plasma&#xD;
      levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol or LDL-cholesterol b) decreased plasma&#xD;
      concentrations of cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol c) postprandial hyperlipidemia or d)&#xD;
      eruptive xanthomas, xanthelasma, tuberous or tendinous xanthomas, or corneal opacities.&#xD;
