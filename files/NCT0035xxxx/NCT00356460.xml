    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of GC1008, a human anti-transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody in previously treated patients with locally advanced or metastatic renal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma or malignant melanoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) is a cytokine which is often over-expressed and&#xD;
      over-produced by malignancies and has been implicated as an important factor in promoting the&#xD;
      growth, progression, and metastatic potential of advanced cancers. In preclinical studies,&#xD;
      TGFβ can act to promote tumor cell migration/invasiveness, influence tumor stroma (by&#xD;
      increasing extracellular matrix production, cytokine secretion, and angiogenesis), and&#xD;
      suppress anti-tumor immunity. The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical use of&#xD;
      GC1008, a human monoclonal antibody capable of binding and neutralizing all isoforms of TGFβ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase 1 multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation study designed to characterize&#xD;
      the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and potential anti-tumor activity&#xD;
      of GC1008, in patients with histologically confirmed, locally advanced and surgically&#xD;
      inoperable or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) or malignant melanoma. Patients with RCC&#xD;
      must have failed at least 1 prior therapy and patients with renal cell carcinoma must have&#xD;
      failed either sorafenib or sunitinib. Other qualifying prior therapies includes any medical,&#xD;
      surgical, radiation or investigational approaches used for potential therapeutic benefit (but&#xD;
      not for diagnostic purposes) in patients with advanced disease. Patients may receive up to 4&#xD;
      intravenous infusions of GC1008, and patients with stable disease, with an objective tumor&#xD;
      response or with clinical benefit may be eligible to receive extended therapy. For part 2 of&#xD;
      the study, only patients with malignant melanoma will be enrolled.&#xD;
