      The purposes of this one-year follow-up study are twofold: (1) to prospectively examine the&#xD;
      spontaneous kicking and the supported stepping movement in VLBW premature infants until&#xD;
      attainment of independent walking; and (2) to assess factors (i.e. gross motor development,&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary function, anthropometry, body composition and cognition) that could&#xD;
      potentially influence walking attainment in VLBW premature infants.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants (birth weight &lt; 1,500g) sustain a high risk of&#xD;
      neuromotor disability, as exemplified by delayed walking attainment. Spontaneous kicking and&#xD;
      supported stepping have been proposed as the early precursors to independent walking. The&#xD;
      continuity of these early leg movements with independent walking has been established in&#xD;
      normal term infants, but such relations remain unclear in VLBE premature infants. Therefore,&#xD;
      the purposes of this one-year follow-up study are twofold: (1) to prospectively examine the&#xD;
      spontaneous kicking and the supported stepping movement in VLBW premature infants until&#xD;
      attainment of independent walking; and (2) to assess factors (i.e. gross motor development,&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary function, anthropometry, body composition and cognition) that could&#xD;
      potentially influence walking attainment in VLBW premature infants. This study will enroll 15&#xD;
      VLBW premature infants born at National Taiwan University Hospital. Infants will be scheduled&#xD;
      for spontaneous kicking examination at 2 and 4 months of corrected age, followed by supported&#xD;
      stepping examination at 9 and 11 months of corrected age and recorded their age of walking&#xD;
      attainment. Age of walking attainment is defined as the time when the child is first able to&#xD;
      move for five successive steps without support. At each visit, infants will be examined for&#xD;
      spontaneous kicking or supported stepping movements (with three-dimensional kinematic&#xD;
      analysis of Peak Motion Analysis System), gross motor function (with the Alberta Infant Motor&#xD;
      Scale), cardiopulmonary function (with a pulsed oxymeter), anthropometry (with scale and tape&#xD;
      measure), body composition (with the Pediatric Plicometric System) and cognition (with the&#xD;
      Chinese Child Development Inventory- Cognitive Subscale). The results of this study will&#xD;
      provide important information to help reveal the maturation process of early leg movements&#xD;
      prior to walking attainment in premature infants. Furthermore, the identified early&#xD;
      neuromotor markers and influencing factors for walking attainment will provide physical&#xD;
      therapists useful guidance in making early treatment plans for those premature infants who&#xD;
      will develop motor delays.&#xD;
