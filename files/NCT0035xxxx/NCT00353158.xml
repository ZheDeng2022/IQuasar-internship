    <textblock>
      This study will examine the phototoxicity, a reaction to light that is like exaggerated&#xD;
      sunburn, which occurs in people who take medications such as voriconazole, a medication used&#xD;
      to fight fungus. Sunscreens might protect the skin from the reaction. Although phototoxicity&#xD;
      from voriconazole is not completely understood, it may be related to how that medication is&#xD;
      metabolized in the liver by enzymes called cytochrome P450 enzymes-and mainly by one known as&#xD;
      2C19. A way to evaluate phototoxicity is through microarrays, which measure how much each&#xD;
      gene is expressed in cells from tissues such as skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients ages 8 and older who are scheduled to begin taking or who currently take&#xD;
      voriconazole may be eligible for this study. Also, patients ages 18 to 45 in good health who&#xD;
      have skin tone known as Type 2, which usually burns and tans only slightly following sun&#xD;
      exposure, may be eligible. All patients will visit the Dermatology Clinic. They will complete&#xD;
      two questionnaires, on medical history and medications, as well as the skin response to&#xD;
      sunlight, and donate about 3 teaspoons of blood. Patients who are scheduled to take&#xD;
      voriconazole will visit the clinic four times, that is, two visits 2 consecutive days before&#xD;
      beginning the medication and two visits on 2 consecutive days after taking it for at least 7&#xD;
      days. Each visit will take 1 to 2 hours. Patients about to take voriconazole will have a&#xD;
      blood test and undergo a physical exam of the skin test site, on the buttocks. Researchers&#xD;
      will take photographs of the specific site and do tests to measure skin reaction to&#xD;
      ultraviolet (UV) light. UV light will be shined on 15 small areas of the skin, each 1 x 1&#xD;
      centimeters. After 24 hours, any redness that occurs on the skin will be checked. Afterward,&#xD;
      patients will begin taking voriconazole according to directions by the researchers. At 10 or&#xD;
      more days later, patients will visit the clinic. Sunscreen will be applied and 1 hour later&#xD;
      after administration of voriconazole, a blood sample will be drawn to check the level of&#xD;
      medication. Then UV light will be shined on 23 areas of skin 1 x 1 centimeters. More&#xD;
      photographs will be taken of test sites to record changes in skin redness. On the next day,&#xD;
      the skin response will be evaluated. Participants in the control group will be asked to avoid&#xD;
      UV radiation by wearing hats and clothing, and using sunscreen. They will be given the&#xD;
      doxycycline, an antibiotic, and undergo procedures with UV light shined on small areas of the&#xD;
      skin, on the buttocks. Control participants will have 7 study days, with visits lasting from&#xD;
      1 to 3 hours and probably not exceeding 8 hours. They will have two shave biopsies on Study&#xD;
      Day 2 and on Study Day 7 to determine how the skin has responded to UV light exposures.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phototoxicity is a sunburn-like response associated with certain medications and is a&#xD;
           phenomenon which is not completely understood. Although clinically similar to a typical&#xD;
           sunburn reaction, the gene expression changes in phototoxic skin reactions may differ&#xD;
           from those in typical sunburn.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Doxycycline is a relatively well-tolerated and known phototoxic antimicrobial which can&#xD;
           be used in healthy volunteers to increase susceptibility to phototoxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterizing potential risk factors to phototoxicity secondary to voriconazole, a&#xD;
           broad-spectrum antifungal agent associated with potentially treatment-limiting&#xD;
           phototoxicity, may allow identification of subjects at risk for the adverse reaction via&#xD;
           pharmacogenetic evaluation and medical record review.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects at risk of phototoxicity may benefit from application of effective sunscreens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the global gene expression profiles in skin exhibiting phototoxic reactions&#xD;
           in healthy volunteers treated with doxycycline, and compare expression profiles in skin&#xD;
           exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation occurring in the absence of doxycycline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the effects of the doxycycline alone in the skin of phototoxic and&#xD;
           non-phototoxic healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize voriconazole-related phototoxicity reactions in subjects with the use of&#xD;
           phototesting and to determine if these subjects may receive reasonable phototoxic&#xD;
           protection from the use of sunblock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  I &amp; II) Healthy volunteers with skin phototype II.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  III) Subjects scheduled to begin voriconazole therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IV) Subjects on chronic voriconazole with or without a history of phototoxicity&#xD;
           reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previously treated healthy volunteers (I &amp; II) who were evaluated to be either&#xD;
           phototoxic&#xD;
&#xD;
      OR non-phototoxic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  I) For the Screening visit arm, forty healthy volunteers will undergo screening with&#xD;
           pertinent skin exam and blood work to evaluate ANA/ENA and liver function profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  II) For the Study visit arm, eligible healthy volunteers will undergo phototesting and&#xD;
           will have skin biopsies prior to initiating a 3-day course of oral doxycycline 100 mg&#xD;
           twice daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the last dose of doxycycline, healthy volunteers will undergo on-treatment MED&#xD;
           testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In those demonstrating phototoxicity, skin biopsies will be performed and submitted for&#xD;
           processing for microarray analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  III) Thirty-five subjects scheduled to begin voriconazole will undergo CYP450 genotyping&#xD;
           and baseline phototesting prior to initiation of voriconazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adult subjects will be invited to undergo optional skin biopsies pre-drug and on-drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Repeat phototesting will be performed in subjects after at least 7 days of voriconazole&#xD;
           to determine if voriconazole predisposes to phototoxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects with voriconazole phototoxicity will be invited to undergo sunscreen testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IV) Seventy subjects with prior clinical history of voriconazole phototoxicity as well&#xD;
           as known voriconazole phototoxicity non-reactors will undergo CYP450 genotyping and&#xD;
           potential phototesting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the effects of the doxycycline alone in the skin of healthy volunteers&#xD;
           previously categorized as phototoxic and non-phototoxic&#xD;
