  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn how people distribute their visual attention&#xD;
      when looking at objects nearby versus far away, and why vision may become distracted at near&#xD;
      versus far distances.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Visual distraction is a problem that more often occurs people who have suffered strokes than&#xD;
      in the general population. Problems of visual attention generally appear immediately&#xD;
      following a stroke, and may impair driving and other functions. While it is thought that&#xD;
      there is a natural course of improvement over time, little is known about how this&#xD;
      improvement occurs. Some studies suggest that recovery is only partial, meaning certain&#xD;
      aspects of visual attention may improve while other aspects remain but escape notice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of stroke on a person's visual attention&#xD;
      when looking at objects nearby versus far away, and to learn why a person's visual attention&#xD;
      may become more distracted at near versus far distances. The purpose of this study is also to&#xD;
      understand how modeled interventions, such as eye patching or prism goggles, affect&#xD;
      impairment measures of visual attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After an initial screening (including attention, thinking, memory, and visual judgment&#xD;
      tests), participants will be given a neurological examination. Participants may be asked to&#xD;
      perform visual tasks while wearing an eye patch or prism goggles. Next, they will be asked to&#xD;
      perform a line bisection task by looking at lines on a video screen either at close or far&#xD;
      distances and, using a laser pointer, marking the center of the lines as they appear&#xD;
      on-screen. Participants may be asked to perform other, similar visual tasks as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of the study for participants varies, ranging from 1 or 2 sessions totaling&#xD;
      approximately 2 hours to multiple sessions spanning a year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research from this study may help researchers better understand problems associated with&#xD;
      stroke and may lead to therapies designed to promote improved visual attention.&#xD;
