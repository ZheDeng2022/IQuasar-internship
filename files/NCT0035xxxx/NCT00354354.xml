      Hypothesis: The reduction of dynamic hyperinflation and its negative effects on the&#xD;
      respiratory system following a bronchodilator could lead to an improvement of cardiac&#xD;
      function in terms of increased cardiac output. This may enhance oxygen delivery to the&#xD;
      exercising muscles in COPD patients. Bronchodilator administration may also have an indirect&#xD;
      effect on V'O2 kinetics via its action on cardiovascular and pulmonary variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the effects of a bronchodilators on V'E , V'CO2 , and V'O2 kinetics in COPD&#xD;
           during constant work-rate cycle exercise, and to evaluate whether bronchodilators will&#xD;
           accelerate, indirectly, phase 2 kinetics (usually slower in COPD patients than normal&#xD;
           subjects) and shorten t for V'E, V'CO2 , and V'O2 and shorten half-times for HR and O2&#xD;
           pulse, thus showing an improvement of oxygen transport to the peripheral active muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the impact of a bronchodilator-induced reduction in dynamic hyperinflation,&#xD;
           and its effects on cardiovascular and pulmonary function, on exercise limitation in&#xD;
           COPD.&#xD;

      The inability to engage in the usual activities of daily living is one of the most&#xD;
      distressing experiences of people afflicted with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease&#xD;
      (COPD). Exercise intolerance progresses relentlessly as the disease advances and can lead to&#xD;
      virtual immobility and social isolation. Our understanding of the complex interface between&#xD;
      physiological impairment and disability in COPD has increased considerably in recent years.&#xD;
      It has become clear that in COPD, exercise intolerance ultimately reflects integrated&#xD;
      abnormalities of the ventilatory, cardiovascular, peripheral muscle and neurosensory systems.&#xD;
      Ventilatory constraint is the dominant contributor to exercise limitation in more advanced&#xD;
      disease. Recently, important studies have been conducted on the role of peripheral muscle&#xD;
      dysfunction in exercise limitation in COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will test the hypothesis that the administration of bronchodilators (i.e.,&#xD;
      inhaled β2-agonist and inhaled anticholinergics in combination) in normoxemic COPD patients&#xD;
      during moderate-intensity constant-load exercise may result in an enhancement of oxidative&#xD;
      metabolism, reflected by reductions of O2 def and phase 2 tV'O2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifteen normoxemic patients with stable COPD (FEV1 less than 60 % predicted) and severe&#xD;
      chronic breathlessness (Baseline Dyspnea Index less than 6) will complete the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will perform three visits. At the first visit, patients will be familiarized&#xD;
      with the various questionnaires and scales for rating the intensity and quality of symptoms&#xD;
      and they will carry out pulmonary function testing and a symptom-limited incremental cycle&#xD;
      exercise test in order to determine the anaerobic threshold (AT), the peak work-rate and the&#xD;
      peak oxygen uptake. Each patient will subsequently complete two visits in which they will&#xD;
      receive either nebulized bronchodilator (BD) (Combivent®, ipratropium 0.5 mg + salbutamol 2.5&#xD;
      mg) or placebo (PL), in random order. At 90-100 minutes post-dose, patients will perform&#xD;
      pulmonary function tests, then they will perform a constant-load exercise test at 80% of AT&#xD;
      V'O2. During constant-load exercise tests (2nd and 3rd visit), small samples of blood from&#xD;
      the earlobe of each subject will be collected in order to determine the level of lactate and&#xD;
      breathing gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide) in the blood.&#xD;
