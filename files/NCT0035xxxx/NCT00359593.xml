  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a leading cause of disability in Canada and frequently causes hemiparesis (upper&#xD;
      limb and lower limb weakness on one side of the body). Approximately one third of stroke&#xD;
      survivors require physical rehabilitation to improve their motor and functional recovery (1).&#xD;
      Although many strategies have been shown to be effective in promoting recovery after stroke,&#xD;
      the uptake of evidence-based practice by rehabilitation professionals across Canada is&#xD;
      variable. The aim of this project is to evaluate whether using an implementation intervention&#xD;
      promotes use of best practices by rehabilitation professionals and leads to improvements in&#xD;
      patient outcomes for individuals with stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is a cluster randomized implementation trial for upper and lower limb&#xD;
      interventions. Rehabilitation centres across Canada will be randomized to receive either an&#xD;
      outcome-oriented implementation strategy (OOI) to facilitate implementation of the EIPRs or a&#xD;
      process-oriented implementation strategy (POI). At the onset, rehabilitation professionals&#xD;
      practicing in all centres will receive education in using best practice outcome measures&#xD;
      related to stroke rehabilitation. All centres will be assessed for baseline adherence to the&#xD;
      EIPRs. Centres in the OOI will receive &quot;usual care&quot; (i.e. passive dissemination of the&#xD;
      written protocols and information about outcome measures). Centres in the POI arm will&#xD;
      receive a combination of strategies to facilitate EIPR uptake (i.e., use of a local&#xD;
      facilitator, practice audits with feedback, reminder systems and educational sessions).&#xD;
      Following exposure to the EIPRs, all centres will document adherence to the EIPRs, and&#xD;
      patient outcomes as assessed by the measures. An analysis of the costs associated with&#xD;
      rehabilitation interventions and the incremental expense of a POI strategy will be&#xD;
      undertaken. These data will be used to compare the OOI and POI centres with respect to the&#xD;
      level of uptake and implementation of EIPRs and related expenses.&#xD;
