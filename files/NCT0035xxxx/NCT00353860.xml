    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of stem cell transplantation in which&#xD;
      the donor s T cells (a type of lymphocyte, or white blood cell) have been removed and then&#xD;
      added back. Certain patients with bone marrow malignancies undergo transplantation of donated&#xD;
      stem cells (cells produced by the bone marrow that mature into the different blood components&#xD;
      white cells, red cells and platelets) to generate new and normally functioning bone marrow.&#xD;
      However, T-cells from the donor may see the patient s cells as foreign and mount an immune&#xD;
      response to reject them, causing what is called graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). Therefore,&#xD;
      in this study, T-cells are removed from the donor cells to prevent this complication.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, there are disadvantages of removing the T-cells, since they are important in&#xD;
      fighting viral infections as well as any remaining malignant cells. The attack against the&#xD;
      malignant cells is called a graft-versus-leukemia effect. Therefore, donor T cells are given&#xD;
      to the patient (added back) later (45 and 100 days after the transplant) when they can&#xD;
      provide needed immunity with less risk of causing GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients between 10 and 55 years of age with chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute&#xD;
      lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, a myelodysplastic syndrome,&#xD;
      myeloproliferative disorders, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Prospective participants and their donors are screened with a medical history and physical&#xD;
      examination, blood tests (including a test to match for genetic compatibility), breathing&#xD;
      tests, chest and sinus X-rays, and tests of heart function. They also undergo a bone marrow&#xD;
      biopsy and aspiration. For this procedure, done under local anesthetic, about a tablespoon of&#xD;
      bone marrow is withdrawn through a needle inserted into the hipbone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may undergo apheresis to collect lymphocytes for research studies. This&#xD;
      procedure involves collecting blood through a needle in the arm, similar to donating a unit&#xD;
      of blood. The lymphocytes are then separated and removed by a cell separator machine, and the&#xD;
      rest of the blood is returned through a needle in the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before treatment begins, patients have a central venous catheter (flexible plastic tube)&#xD;
      placed in a vein. This line remains in place during the stem cell transfusion and recovery&#xD;
      period for drawing and transfusing blood, giving medications, and infusing the donated cells.&#xD;
      Preparation for the transfusion includes irradiation and chemotherapy. Patients undergo total&#xD;
      body irradiation in 8 doses given in two 30-minute sessions a day for 4 days. Four days&#xD;
      before the transfusion, they begin taking cyclophosphamide, and 9days before the procedure&#xD;
      they start fludarabine. These are anti-cancer drugs that kill the cancer cells and prevent&#xD;
      rejection of the donated cells. While the patient is receiving chemotherapy, the donor&#xD;
      receives daily injections for 6 days of G-CSF, a drug that moves stem cells from the bone&#xD;
      marrow into the blood stream. On days 1 and 2 after chemotherapy is completed, the stem cells&#xD;
      are infused into the patient through the central line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients usually stay in the hospital about 20 to 30 days after the transplant to recover&#xD;
      from treatment side effects, which may include fever, nausea, diarrhea and mouth pain, and&#xD;
      receive blood transfusions, if needed. Treatment with cyclosporine, a drug that helps&#xD;
      prevents both rejection of donated cells and GVHD, is started on day 44 one day before the&#xD;
      first T-cell add-back. Patients return to the clinic for follow-up with various tests,&#xD;
      treatments and examinations as required, with a minimum of visits at least once or twice a&#xD;
      week for 2 to 4 months after the transplant; then at 4, 6, 9, and 12 months, and then yearly&#xD;
      for at least 3 years.&#xD;

      Bone marrow stem cell transplant studies carried out by the NHLBI BMT Unit have focused on&#xD;
      approaches to optimize the stem cell and lymphocyte dose in order to improve transplant&#xD;
      survival and increase the graft-vs.-leukemia effect. The aim is to create the transplant&#xD;
      conditions that permit rapid donor immune recovery without causing graft-versus-host disease&#xD;
      (GVHD) by using no post-transplant immunosuppression in conjunction with a transplant&#xD;
      depleted of T cells to a fixed low dose, below the threshold known to be associated with&#xD;
      GVHD. A primary objective of the protocol is therefore to test whether the low dose of T&#xD;
      cells chosen minimizes the risk and severity of GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have found that the outcome from transplant is improved by using high stem cell doses, and&#xD;
      in successive protocols we have achieved progressive improvement in transplant-related&#xD;
      mortality from 35% in the first protocol in 1993 to 22% for the latest study. In the last&#xD;
      study, in this series, we used the Nexell Isolex 300i system to obtain high CD34+ doses&#xD;
      depleted of lymphocytes to a fixed CD3+ T cell dose of 5 x 10(4)/kg. The use of the cell&#xD;
      separator and the monoclonal antibodies is covered by IDE 8139. The study focused on the role&#xD;
      of cyclosporine in preventing GVHD after T cell depletion. We found that CSA appears to&#xD;
      protect against both GVHD and graft failure, with a higher incidence of both complications&#xD;
      occurring in patients not receiving CSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the results and shortcomings of the previous protocol, while continuing to avoid&#xD;
      immunosuppression post-transplant, we will now test two hypotheses: (1) GVHD incidence and&#xD;
      severity can be reduced by transfusing a T cell dose of 2 x 10(4)/CD3 cell/kg. (2) Graft&#xD;
      rejection can be prevented by increasing the immunosuppressive intensity of the&#xD;
      pre-transplant preparative regimen using fludarabine and cyclophosphamide and a reduced dose&#xD;
      of total body irradiation (12 Gy instead of 13.6 Gy). We will use the same in vitro cell&#xD;
      separation system namely the Isolex 300i and monoclonal antibodies provided by CTEP (anti CD&#xD;
      6, anti CD2, anti CD7). This is covered by a continuing IND for the selection of CD34+ and&#xD;
      CD3+ cells for T cell depleted peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
