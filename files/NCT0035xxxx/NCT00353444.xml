      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Transcranial Doppler measurements have&#xD;
      correlation with neuropsychological test (Galvestone Orientation Amnesia Test), TC image&#xD;
      (Marshall Scale) and prognosis (DRS and GOS) in moderate head injury&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The head injury is a frequent problem of health, which produces high morbi-mortality. Today&#xD;
      is the main cause of death and disability between 18 and 40 years. In addition it originates&#xD;
      expensive expenses in health care systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severity of cerebral injury is not only because of impact, it is implicated many&#xD;
      physiopathological changes. Decrease or increase of cerebral blood flow (CBF) play important&#xD;
      roll formation of edema and intracranial hypertension. Hypoxic/ischemic damage is the final&#xD;
      point of both changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The transcranial Doppler (TCD) was introduced around 1982. Through TCD can be measured the&#xD;
      flow velocity of intracranial arteries, which let us identify changes in diameter in vessels.&#xD;
      There are three windows of access to arteries: transtemporal, transorbitary and suboccipital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parameter are systolic velocity (S), tele-diastolic velocity (D), mean velocity (M) and&#xD;
      pulsatility index (PI). Many studies have been conducted for evaluate utility in head injury,&#xD;
      TCD can identify changes that correlate with alteration in CBF intracranial pressure (ICP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The autoregulatory status is important, TCD with decrement in D and increment in PI could&#xD;
      tell us about failure in this issue. An invasive way for estimate cerebral perfusion pressure&#xD;
      (CCP) with TCD. The most sensible for fall in is amplitude in FV. However there is more&#xD;
      correlation between CPP and PI. Vasospasm can occur post trauma, for identify the Lindegaard&#xD;
      ratio (FVcma/FVcia) is useful. The other change, hyperemia, can be demonstrated by&#xD;
      continuously increase FV. In post traumatic time is very important identify alterations which&#xD;
      could produce ischemia. The measurement of CPP generally is gotten by invasión with ICP&#xD;
      determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In severe head injury has been demonstrated correlation between ICP and PI, strongest for CPP&#xD;
      and PI. Other parameters are oligaemia and vasospasm in the first 24 hours correlate poor&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the non invasive characteristic and good correlation with physiologic and&#xD;
      prognosis, we think it is important evaluate if there are a kind of correlation between&#xD;
      amnesia and orientation, prognosis and TCD parameters.&#xD;
