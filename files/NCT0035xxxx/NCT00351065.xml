      Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel group, fixed dose, multi-center&#xD;
      dose-finding study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients voluntarily signed the informed consent form of the clinical study and underwent&#xD;
      a screening. After completing the four-week run-in period, they were randomly assigned to&#xD;
      either a placebo group or one of the three SK3530 groups: 50mg, 100mg, and 150mg. The study&#xD;
      was conducted in a double-blind manner. A different dose of SK3530 was administered to the&#xD;
      subjects depending on the assigned treatment group for 8 weeks. Patient's visit took place at&#xD;
      week 4 and week 8 after randomization and at 6 or 7days after end of study.&#xD;
