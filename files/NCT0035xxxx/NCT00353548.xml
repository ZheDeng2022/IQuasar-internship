      This study will use a sipping and spitting exercise to better understand the brain's response&#xD;
      to food intake in people with eating disorders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eating behavior is controlled by many factors, including appetite; food availability; family,&#xD;
      peer, and cultural practices; and attempts at voluntary control. Eating disorders are&#xD;
      characterized by a voluntary control of eating behavior, causing serious disturbances in&#xD;
      normal eating habits. People with eating disorders demonstrate an extreme and unhealthy&#xD;
      reduction or increase in food intake, as well as feelings of distress or extreme concern&#xD;
      about body shape or weight. The three most common types of eating disorders are anorexia&#xD;
      nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder. People with anorexia nervosa have an&#xD;
      intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat. They are usually underweight, and resist&#xD;
      maintaining a body weight at or above the minimum normal weight for their age and height.&#xD;
      People with bulimia nervosa are less frequently underweight. Their eating habits are&#xD;
      characterized by episodes of bingeing, followed by episodes of purging. Similarly, people&#xD;
      with binge eating disorder have eating habits characterized by episodes of binge eating, but&#xD;
      no purging. Studies on the basic biology of appetite control and the effects of overeating&#xD;
      and starvation have revealed extensive information about eating disorders, but there are&#xD;
      still questions to be answered. This study will use a sipping and spitting exercise to better&#xD;
      understand the brain's response to food intake in people with eating disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this observational study will first report to the Biological Studies Unit&#xD;
      (BSU) for a screening visit. Participants will be provided with a series of sweetened&#xD;
      beverages to taste and spit out. The beverages will be made with water, Kool-Aid mix, and&#xD;
      sugar or artificial sweetener. Participants will rate the sweetness of each beverage and how&#xD;
      much they like it. They will then practice sipping the beverage through a straw and spitting&#xD;
      it out without swallowing. Those participants who feel comfortable with the sipping and&#xD;
      spitting exercise will report to the BSU for 10 sipping and spitting exercises. The exercises&#xD;
      may be scheduled on up to 4 separate days, and may last up to 2 hours per day. Participants&#xD;
      will eat a standardized breakfast on the morning of the study, and then will not eat again&#xD;
      until they report to the BSU 4 hours later. Participants will sit alone in a room alone, and&#xD;
      sip and spit beverages for up to 5 minutes at a time. Between sipping and spitting sessions,&#xD;
      participants will complete surveys about hunger and other sensations. They will also rinse&#xD;
      their mouths out with baking soda and water to clear the taste of the previous beverage and&#xD;
      to prevent discoloration of the mouth from the Kool-Aid. Measurements will include the amount&#xD;
      of beverage sipped at a time, and how quickly each was sipped.&#xD;
