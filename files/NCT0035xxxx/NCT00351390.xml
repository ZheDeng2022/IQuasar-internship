  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Levels of amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) a hormone released from&#xD;
      the heart in patients with heart failure (HF) are strongly prognostic of adverse events, such&#xD;
      as hospitalization or death from HF. Therapies that are beneficial for HF (such as beta&#xD;
      blockers or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors) tend to lower levels of NT-proBNP in&#xD;
      parallel with improvements in outcomes of patients so treated. Importantly, Nt-proBNP levels&#xD;
      may identify a patient at high risk for adverse outcome from their HF, even in periods of&#xD;
      apparent stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It remains unclear, however, whether treating patients based on their NT-proBNP&#xD;
      concentrations would be associated with better outcomes compared to standard HF therapy&#xD;
      without measurement of NT-proBNP values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the PROTECT study is to evaluate whether treatment of patients with advanced and&#xD;
      recently destabilized HF would benefit from NT-proBNP guided HF treatment, compared to&#xD;
      standard HF therapy without such 'hormone guided' treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      300 patients with class II-IV heart failure (HF) due to systolic dysfunction (left&#xD;
      ventricular ejection fraction &lt;40%) and recent (within 6 months) destabilized HF will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 to either 'standard of care' therapy for their HF versus 'standard of care&#xD;
      plus NT-proBNP guided' care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At randomization, patients at MGH will undergo a 2-dimensional echocardiogram for cardiac&#xD;
      structure and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the 'standard of care' arm of the study will receive aggressive&#xD;
      therapy for their HF, including evidence-based addition/titration of therapeutic agents in&#xD;
      the trial, such as carvedilol or metoprolol XL, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or&#xD;
      angiotensin receptor blockers, spironolactone inhibitors (for those in class III or IV),&#xD;
      digoxin (when applicable), loop diuretics, as well as nitrates with or without hydralazine.&#xD;
      Biventricular pacing with/without ICD capability will be performed at the discretion of the&#xD;
      investigator. Any changes in therapy will be accompanied by a 2 week follow up for&#xD;
      re-assessment and further titration of medications, based on clinical judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each interim visit, patients in the 'standard of care' arm will have a Minnesota Living&#xD;
      with Heart Failure questionnaire taken. For all visits, including those triggered by med&#xD;
      changes, laboratories will be checked including serum chemistries; a sample of blood for&#xD;
      blinded NT-proBNP, troponin T, and high sensitivity CRP will be obtained for measurement&#xD;
      after the trial is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the 'standard of care plus NT-proBNP guided' arm will receive the same&#xD;
      aggressive medical care as above, but will also have an unblinded measurement of NT-proBNP&#xD;
      provided to the study investigator within an hour of first patient contact. Therapeutic&#xD;
      decision-making will be first based on clinical acumen/judgment, but if the NT-proBNP is&#xD;
      elevated, per protocol, the investigator will adjust therapies accordingly, including&#xD;
      escalation of existing therapies with known effects on NT-proBNP levels, as well as possible&#xD;
      addition of similar therapies not yet in use (such as spironolactone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for events including destabilized HF (in or outpatient),&#xD;
      cardiovascular events (including ischemic complications, ICD discharge, or development of&#xD;
      non-fatal arrhythmia such as atrial fibrillation), or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of one year, event rates will be assessed and the outcomes in the two arms will be&#xD;
      compared. As well, echocardiography will be performed on subjects at one year and differences&#xD;
      from baseline in both groups will be assessed.&#xD;
