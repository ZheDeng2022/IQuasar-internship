  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, patients with suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremities&#xD;
      receive the ultrasound investigation of their deep vein system, either by limited&#xD;
      ultrasonography (ultrasonography confined to the proximal veins, repeating the test after one&#xD;
      week in patients with positive D-dimer) or by extended ultrasonography (ultrasonography&#xD;
      extented to the entire deep vein system of the legs). No study has directly compared the two&#xD;
      strategies to assess their accuracy and safety. We plan to compare the accuracy and safety of&#xD;
      the two strategies in a prospective randomized study addressing more than 2000 consecutive&#xD;
      outpatients presenting with the clinical suspicion of DVT.&#xD;

      All consecutive outpatients referred to the study center with clinically suspected deep vein&#xD;
      thrombosis are potentially eligible for inclusion. Patients are excluded if they have a&#xD;
      history of previous venous thromboembolism, have clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism,&#xD;
      have a life expectancy shorter than 3 months, have used therapeutic doses of unfractionated&#xD;
      heparin, low molecular weight heparin or oral anticoagulants for more than 48 hours, have&#xD;
      another indication for anticoagulant treatment, are pregnant, are aged less than 18 years,&#xD;
      are inaccessible to follow-up, or refuse participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Before randomization, patients are interviewed using a standardized&#xD;
      questionnaire in order to collect information on risk factors for venous thrombosis, and the&#xD;
      presence of several clinical signs and symptoms. Subsequently, they are randomized to the&#xD;
      limited or the extended ultrasound strategy through computer generated lists, each of 100&#xD;
      patients arranged in balanced blocks of 10, specific for each center. The list is accessible&#xD;
      only for a study nurse who informed the study physicians about group allocation once patients&#xD;
      had provided informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial diagnostic workup Patients randomized to limited ultrasonography undergo compression&#xD;
      ultrasonography, confining the investigation to the common femoral and the popliteal vein&#xD;
      down to its trifurcation. In patients with normal findings D-dimer testing is performed, and&#xD;
      they are subsequently managed according to its results: patients with normal D-dimer levels&#xD;
      do not receive further investigation, while those with abnormal test are scheduled for repeat&#xD;
      compression ultrasonography within one week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the extended ultrasonography receive first the evaluation of the&#xD;
      proximal vein system, including the common femoral, the superficial femoral and the popliteal&#xD;
      vein down its trifurcation. Then patients with compressible proximal veins undergo the&#xD;
      extensive evaluation of the calf vein system, including the anterior tibial, posterior tibial&#xD;
      and peroneal veins, and, if the deep veins were normal, also of the muscular (gastrocnemial&#xD;
      and soleal) veins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limited ultrasonography and D-dimer The common femoral at the groin, and the popliteal vein&#xD;
      down to its branching into the calf deep veins at the popliteal fossa, are examined in the&#xD;
      transverse plane only, with a 7.5 MHz linear probe. The test results are categorized as&#xD;
      normal (compressible veins) or abnormal (non compressible veins).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We use a rapid whole blood bedside D-dimer assay (SimpliRED® D-Dimer assay, AGEN Biomedical&#xD;
      Ltd., Brisbane Australia). This assay is based on autologous red cell agglutination, using a&#xD;
      chemical conjugate of a monoclonal antibody specific to human D-dimer (DD-3B6/22) linked to a&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody which binds to the surface of human red blood cells (RAT-1C3/86) as&#xD;
      active agent. The test can be performed either on capillary or on citrated venous blood.&#xD;
      Agglutination occurs at D-dimer concentrations above 0.2 mg/L. The SimpliRED® results are&#xD;
      categorized as normal, abnormal or non interpretable. The latter finding is categorized as&#xD;
      abnormal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extended ultrasonography All veins are imaged along their length with a 7.5 MHz linear&#xD;
      transducer. The proximal venous system is examined starting from the (common and superficial)&#xD;
      femoral veins, which are scanned down to the distal part of the thigh, with the patient lying&#xD;
      supine. Then, with the patient in the prone position the popliteal vein down to its&#xD;
      trifurcation is evaluated. The calf veins are evaluated with the patient sitting with his/her&#xD;
      legs hanging over the edge of the bed. Starting from the most proximal venous segments&#xD;
      downwards, the anterior, posterior tibial and peroneal veins are visualized along their&#xD;
      length, employing augmentation maneuvers (manual squeezing of the distal calf or of the foot)&#xD;
      to enhance vessel visualization. The same approach is used to image the muscular veins. The&#xD;
      only criterion to adjudicate a thrombosis involving the proximal system and the tibial and&#xD;
      peroneal veins is the finding of a non compressible venous segment. As for the muscular&#xD;
      veins, criteria for abnormal testing are incompressibility or the lack of spontaneous&#xD;
      intraluminal color filling or reverse-flow color filling after augmentation maneuvers. All&#xD;
      tests are performed by highly skilled physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up All patients with an initial normal workup are discouraged from receiving&#xD;
      antithrombotic drugs, and are scheduled for a clinical evaluation at three months. They are&#xD;
      instructed to immediately contact the study centers should symptoms of venous thromboembolism&#xD;
      become manifest in the meantime. In this case they undergo instrumental testing to confirm or&#xD;
      refute the presence of the disease. Patients failing to attend the scheduled visit are&#xD;
      contacted by telephone to assess their status, and invited to attend a clinical evaluation at&#xD;
      the study centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes The primary outcomes of the study are: (1) the prevalence and location of venous&#xD;
      thrombosis as shown by the initial diagnostic workup; (2) the rate of symptomatic venous&#xD;
      thromboembolic events (including proximal vein thrombosis, isolated thrombosis of the tibial&#xD;
      or peroneal veins in either leg, and pulmonary embolism) during three months of follow up in&#xD;
      patients with an initially normal diagnostic workup. All suspected events are to be&#xD;
      objectively evaluated as follows: ipsilateral or contralateral deep vein thrombosis is ruled&#xD;
      in by abnormal compression ultrasonography or by the finding of an intraluminal filling&#xD;
      defect on ascending venography, visible on two different projections; suspected pulmonary&#xD;
      embolism is confirmed by an abnormal spiral computed tomography of the lung, by a high&#xD;
      probability ventilation-perfusion lung scan, or by an abnormal pulmonary angiography. Fatal&#xD;
      pulmonary embolism is adjudicated on the findings of autopsy, in case of sudden and otherwise&#xD;
      inexplicable death, or on clinical grounds according to the opinion of an independent&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent and blind committee adjudicates all suspected thromboembolic events and all&#xD;
      deaths occurring during the follow up based on all relevant documents and footage.&#xD;
