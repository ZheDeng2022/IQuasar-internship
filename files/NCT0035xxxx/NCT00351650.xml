  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test dihydrotetrabenazine, or 11C-DTBZ, a radioactive tracer, as an imaging&#xD;
      agent in positron emission tomography (PET). That tracer may have the ability to&#xD;
      noninvasively measure beta cell, that is, -cell mass (BCM) in humans. For researchers hoping&#xD;
      to develop new treatments for diabetes mellitus, a method of measuring BCM is very important.&#xD;
      In this study, researchers will determine if patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus, who have&#xD;
      almost no BCM, have much less pancreatic uptake of the tracer than do patients without&#xD;
      diabetes. Patients ages 18 and older may be eligible for this study. Three groups will be&#xD;
      studied: Participants who have Type 1 diabetes, those without diabetes, and those who have&#xD;
      been successfully treated with a transplant of the pancreas or pancreas and kidney&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves three sets of tests that can be done as an outpatient or after being&#xD;
      admitted to the hospital. Patients will undergo a medical history and procedures including&#xD;
      collection of blood (about 4 teaspoons), pregnancy test for women of childbearing age,&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, PET scan, and tests involving arginine and glucose.&#xD;
      Arginine is a substance that stimulates insulin release from the -cells. During the&#xD;
      procedure, two intravenous (IV) lines are placed into the arms, one to administer arginine&#xD;
      and the other to draw blood (about eight samples during 10 minutes). For the glucose test,&#xD;
      patients will drink a solution of dextrose, a sugar, and blood samples will be taken over 2&#xD;
      hours from the IV lines. Some patients experience nausea after drinking the solution. Within&#xD;
      48 hours of either test or both, patients will be placed in the PET scan machine and given an&#xD;
      injection of the radioactive material through an IV line. Blood samples of about one-half&#xD;
      teaspoon will be drawn before the procedure starts and again every 10 seconds for the first 2&#xD;
      minutes and at several intervals, up to 60 minutes. Finally, patients will also an MRI scan,&#xD;
      30 to 60 minutes long, of the abdomen. This test will be down within two weeks of the PET&#xD;
      scan. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of body organs and&#xD;
      tissues. During the scan, patients will be asked to lie still on a table that slides into the&#xD;
      tunnel of the scanner. They will be given earplugs, for the machine can be noisy. Patients&#xD;
      who have metal within their body that is not compatible with the MRI machine will be&#xD;
      withdrawn from the study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a metabolic disorder in which pancreatic insulin producing B-cells (located in&#xD;
      cell clusters called the islets of Langerhans) no longer produce sufficient insulin to&#xD;
      maintain an individual's blood sugar concentration within the normal range. Insufficient&#xD;
      B-cell function can be caused by an autoimmune killing of the B-cells in type 1 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus (T1DM), or by poorly understood mechanisms in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).&#xD;
      Regardless of the underlying cause, the development of new diabetes treatments is limited by&#xD;
      our current inability to objectively measure B-cell mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose testing a previously used clinical radioligand, dihydrotetrabenazine (DTBZ), as a&#xD;
      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging agent for its ability to non-invasively measure&#xD;
      B-cell mass in humans. We will study 30 patients, 10 with T1DM, 10 with normal glucose&#xD;
      homeostasis, and 5 with a history of T1DM, but successfully restored glucose homeostasis&#xD;
      following whole pancreas transplantation. Prior to the PET scans, each patient will undergo&#xD;
      metabolic testing to characterize their glucose homeostasis and insulin producing capacity.&#xD;
      The pancreas will be initially identified in each patient with high-resolution magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI). Then, using anatomical landmarks identified by the MRI, the subject&#xD;
      will undergo DTBZ-PET imaging. We predict that the radioactivity signal in the pancreas from&#xD;
      the DTBZ-PET images will be significantly different between control subjects and T1DM&#xD;
      subjects. Further, we predict that the DTBZ-PET images obtained in individuals with&#xD;
      functioning pancreas allografts (and such patients have two pancreases- their native pancreas&#xD;
      and their pancreas allografts) will reveal signal intensities from the two glands that&#xD;
      correlates closely with each gland's insulin producing capacity. Should these studies suggest&#xD;
      DTBZ has merit as a beta cell imaging agent, we will expand the study to include patients&#xD;
      with T2DM.&#xD;
