  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 20 million Americans suffer from Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) creating risks&#xD;
      for major health problems, including dementia, heart attack, and stroke. Obesity, a growing&#xD;
      problem for Americans and Veterans alike, is the greatest risk factor for the development of&#xD;
      OSA. Male gender and smoking, other OSA risk factors, are common in Veterans. Given the high&#xD;
      comorbidity of these risk factors in Veterans, OSA presents a significant health burden to&#xD;
      Veterans. The investigators' prior work provides evidence that OSA occurs in up to 69% of&#xD;
      Vietnam-era Veterans with PTSD. OSA is easily treated; however, 15-30% of OSA patients are&#xD;
      non-compliant with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), the standard OSA treatment.&#xD;
      The proposed research aims to facilitate adherence to CPAP treatment by testing a novel&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral therapy intervention in Veterans with PTSD. If successful, it may&#xD;
      represent an approach that could be applied to the rehabilitation of other chronic conditions&#xD;
      with similar barriers to care.&#xD;

      GOALS AND EXPECTED OUTCOMES OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH The purpose of this proposal is to test&#xD;
      a novel cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention to increase continuous positive&#xD;
      airway pressure (CPAP) treatment adherence for PTSD Veterans with a diagnosis of obstructive&#xD;
      sleep apnea (OSA). PTSD is a common, debilitating psychiatric consequence of exposure to&#xD;
      trauma and a source of significant disability among U.S. war Veterans. The largest&#xD;
      epidemiologic study of PTSD in Vietnam Veterans estimates that 15% of Vietnam Veterans suffer&#xD;
      from PTSD [3]. The investigators' research on OSA in Vietnam era Veterans found that 69% of&#xD;
      the Veterans in the sample had an Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) 10 [4]. OSA is likely present in&#xD;
      50% of middle-aged and older VA patients [4, 5]. The recurrent hypoxemia and sleep&#xD;
      fragmentation associated with OSA can lead to neural injury and functional impairment.&#xD;
      Efficacious treatments are available for OSA (e.g., CPAP); however, Veterans with OSA&#xD;
      frequently fail to use them [4, 6, 7], leaving these Veterans at risk for cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction [8], deterioration of physical health [9], and negative functional outcomes [10].&#xD;
      The investigators' long-term goal is to improve Veterans' functional outcomes by improving&#xD;
      adherence to CPAP. If this intervention proves successful, it may represent an approach that&#xD;
      could be applied to the rehabilitation of other chronic conditions with similar barriers to&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND STRATEGY The reasons for low CPAP adherence include barriers related to&#xD;
      discomfort in using CPAP and psychological barriers to behavior change [11]. A CBT treatment&#xD;
      to improve CPAP adherence, CBT-OSA, has been successfully applied in civilian randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials (RCTs) [12, 13]. The proposed VA intervention would involve delivery of&#xD;
      CBT-OSA to PTSD Veterans to foster long-term CPAP adherence. The CBT-OSA treatment would&#xD;
      build on the VISN 21 MIRECC's expertise in CBT interventions [e.g., VA rollout of&#xD;
      CBT-Insomnia] as well as on the investigators' current research on PTSD Veterans with OSA. In&#xD;
      this sample, the vast majority were not diagnosed with OSA prior to study entry; however, 69%&#xD;
      of the participants had an AHI 10 [4]. Of the Veterans previously diagnosed with OSA, 63%&#xD;
      were not using their CPAP. Thus, CPAP adherence treatment for PTSD Veterans is the next&#xD;
      logical step in the investigators' research. Specifically, the investigators propose a 1-year&#xD;
      parallel-group RCT involving 120 PTSD Veterans with a diagnosis of OSA. All participants will&#xD;
      receive treatment as usual in VA Pulmonary Service. Participants in the active arm will&#xD;
      receive CBT-OSA from a trained Clinical Psychologist. The other arm will receive individual&#xD;
      Education based treatment, but not CBT-OSA. Participants in both arms will receive weekly,&#xD;
      individual sessions during the first 4 weeks of CPAP treatment and 4 booster sessions during&#xD;
      the 1-year protocol. These two arms will be referred to hereafter as the CBT-OSA and the&#xD;
      Education groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *The investigators will add telehealth treatment as an option for participants due to the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic. Research visits may be conducted either in-person or via telehealth (e.g.,&#xD;
      via video or telephone). Telehealth sessions are subject to approval by the research team.&#xD;
      Videoconferencing in particular, requires certain features such as hardware, internet&#xD;
      accessibility, and telephone capability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES Hypothesis 1. (Primary) Effect of CBT on CPAP usage. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that the CBT-OSA group will use CPAP more hours per night on average than the Education&#xD;
      group. ANCOVA will be used to test group differences over time in hours of &quot;mask-on&quot; CPAP&#xD;
      usage per night. [Primary endpoint: mean of Days 335-365.] Hypothesis 2. (Secondary) Effect&#xD;
      of CBT on Self-reported Everyday Activities, Mood and Quality of Life. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that after initiating CPAP treatment, Veterans in the CBT-OSA group will report&#xD;
      more improvement in the ease of performing everyday activities compared to that reported by&#xD;
      those in the Education group. ANCOVA will be used to test group differences over time in the&#xD;
      total score on the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ; [14], at Days 0, 21, 365&#xD;
      (endpoint).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3. (Secondary) Effect of CBT on Cognitive Outcomes. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that the CBT-OSA group will have better cognitive outcomes than the Education group over&#xD;
      time. ANCOVA will be applied to the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Delayed Recall Score&#xD;
      with the primary endpoint at Day 365.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 4. (Secondary) Effect of CBT on PTSD. The investigators hypothesize that the&#xD;
      CBT-OSA group will have fewer PTSD symptoms than the Education group over time. ANCOVA will&#xD;
      be used to test group differences over time in the total score on the PTSD Checklist for&#xD;
      DSM-5 (PCL-5), measured at Days 0, 21, 365. Primary endpoint is Day 365.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory and Supplementary Analyses. (Secondary): Individual Differences in Response&#xD;
      (Moderators). Severity of OSA, initial self-efficacy, and other covariates (measured at the&#xD;
      pre-treatment Screening Visit) will be examined in exploratory, hypothesis-generating&#xD;
      analyses to determine &quot;in whom&quot; CBT-OSA works best. Mechanisms of Action (Mediators). Because&#xD;
      CBT-OSA is designed to increase self-efficacy in CPAP adherence, the investigators aim to&#xD;
      show that some of the effect of CBT-OSA on CPAP usage is mediated by change in the self-rated&#xD;
      Self-Efficacy Measure for Sleep Apnea (SEMSA) [15], measured at Days 0, 21, 365.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HOW THE PROPOSED WORK WILL ADDRESS LONGER-TERM GOALS This research fits the VA's goal to&#xD;
      reduce functional disabilities in PTSD Veterans with chronic medical conditions. It is&#xD;
      designed to not only determine the benefit of this intervention overall, but also to&#xD;
      determine in which Veterans CBT-OSA works best. The dataset collected will enable researchers&#xD;
      to troubleshoot the intervention and propose improved interventions.&#xD;
