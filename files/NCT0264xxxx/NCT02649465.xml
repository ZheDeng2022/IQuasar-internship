  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinicopathological analyses revealed that reduction in HbA1c and use of insulin&#xD;
      independently contribute to the reduction in liver fibrosis scores during the histological&#xD;
      course of NAFLD development. These findings led us to hypothesize that glycemic control and&#xD;
      insulin ameliorate or protect against the histological progression of liver fibrosis in&#xD;
      patients with NAFLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, we investigated the efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitor tofogliflozin and&#xD;
      sulfonylurea glimepiride, which lower glucose levels similarly with reduction and elevation&#xD;
      in circulating insulin levels, respectively, in NAFLD patients with type 2 diabetes for 48&#xD;
      weeks by examining liver histology, as well as hepatic enzymes, metabolic markers, and&#xD;
      hepatic gene expression profiles.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), ranging from simple fatty liver to nonalcoholic&#xD;
      steatohepatitis (NASH), is a liver phenotype of metabolic disorders, such as diabetes,&#xD;
      obesity, and metabolic syndrome. NAFLD and type 2 diabetes share epidemiological and&#xD;
      pathophysiological features. Specifically, hyperglycemia is closely associated with liver&#xD;
      fibrosis, which is associated with liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and prognosis&#xD;
      in patients with NASH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, some anti-diabetic agents have been tested in patients with NAFLD. The guidelines in&#xD;
      the Asian Pacific, European, and American association recommended the administration of PPAR&#xD;
      gamma agonist (pioglitazone) and glucagon-like peptide receptor agonists (GLP1RA) for the&#xD;
      treatment of diabetes with NAFLD/NASH. However, there are concerns about adverse effects such&#xD;
      as weight gain, edema, fractures, and carcinogenesis in pioglitazone or gastrointestinal&#xD;
      adverse effects and medication burden as an injection in GLP1 RA. In addition, because all of&#xD;
      these anti-diabetic agents significantly reduced glycemic levels compared with placebo, liver&#xD;
      histological improvement may be theoretically attributable to glucose reduction itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and sulfonylureas are chosen as the&#xD;
      second-line therapy when glycemic control cannot be achieved with metformin or as the&#xD;
      first-line therapy when metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated. In animal models of&#xD;
      NAFLD/NASH, SGLT2 inhibitors protect against steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. Previous&#xD;
      clinical trials have demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors exert protective effects on liver&#xD;
      enzymes and liver steatosis in patients with NAFLD/NASH. However, these studies lack a&#xD;
      control group or histological examination, which precludes meaningful conclusions since the&#xD;
      natural course of the disease or tight glycemic control may ameliorate liver histology in&#xD;
      some patients with NAFLD. Sulfonylureas are still reliable and potent antidiabetic agents in&#xD;
      insulinopenic patients with type 2 diabetes and therefore are used as the second-line&#xD;
      therapy, especially when the cost is a significant issue. Besides, sulfonylureas reduce&#xD;
      glucose and elevate weight, which may render positive and negative effects, respectively, on&#xD;
      liver pathology in NAFLD/NASH. In the phase 3 trial, canagliflozin was non-inferior to&#xD;
      glimepiride for reduction of HbA1c at 52 weeks. However, the differences between SGLT2&#xD;
      inhibitors and sulfonylureas on NAFLD patients with type 2 diabetes under similar glucose&#xD;
      reduction remain uncertain.&#xD;
