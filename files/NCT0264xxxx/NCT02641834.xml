      The study is a randomized, open, cross-over trial designed to test whether a vegetarian diet&#xD;
      would benefit the cardiovascular risk profile of the participants, compared with a&#xD;
      Mediterranean diet.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nutrition is able to substantially alter the health status of the general population. In&#xD;
      industrialized countries such as Italy the most important association between diet and health&#xD;
      is certainly the relationship with cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death and&#xD;
      disability. The ability to identify with certainty, therefore, the relationship between diet&#xD;
      and cardiovascular disease appears to be a key element in the implementation of specific&#xD;
      primary prevention strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular diseases would be the result of interactions between genetics and&#xD;
      environmental factors. Many studies have evaluated the associations between food groups,&#xD;
      foods, or nutrients and chronic diseases, and a consensus about the role of nutritional&#xD;
      factors in the etiology of common diseases, such as cardiovascular and neoplastic diseases,&#xD;
      has gradually emerged. Recent studies have been focused on examining the impact of a whole&#xD;
      dietary approach rather than on isolating single nutrients; it is recognized that analyses of&#xD;
      single nutrients ignore the important and complex interactions between components of a diet&#xD;
      and, more importantly, because people do not eat isolated nutrients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The optimal dietary strategy for the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases remains a&#xD;
      challenging and a highly relevant preventive health issue. Over the last years, numerous&#xD;
      evidence on the existing relationship between nutrition and chronic degenerative diseases&#xD;
      have led investigators to search for the optimal dietary pattern to maintain a good health&#xD;
      status. Several models of diet have been imposed on public attention, but those that got the&#xD;
      most interest are certainly Mediterranean and vegetarian diets. These dietary patterns seem&#xD;
      to exert protective effects on blood pressure, lipid profiles, cardiovascular diseases and&#xD;
      metabolic parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The term Mediterranean diet has been widely used to describe the traditional dietary habits&#xD;
      of people in Crete, South Italy, and other Mediterranean countries during the decade of the&#xD;
      1960s. Since the first data from the Seven Countries Study, several studies in different&#xD;
      populations have established a beneficial role for the main components of the Mediterranean&#xD;
      diet on the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases and chronic degenerative diseases. This&#xD;
      dietary pattern is characterized by plentiful plant foods (fruits, vegetables, breads, other&#xD;
      forms of cereals, beans, nuts, and seeds), olive oil as the principal source of fat, moderate&#xD;
      amounts of dairy products (mainly cheese and yogurt), low to moderate amounts of fish and&#xD;
      poultry, red meat in low amounts and wine consumed in low to moderate quantities, usually&#xD;
      with meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vegetarian diet is a diet that excludes the use of animal foods (meat, fish) in its&#xD;
      fresh, preserved and/or processed. The increase in the number of vegetarians is attributable&#xD;
      to health, ethical, environmental, and social concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, meta-analysis conducted by our group have revealed, in a population of over than 2&#xD;
      million of people, that a strict adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern is associated&#xD;
      with a significant improvement in health status, as seen by a significant reduction in&#xD;
      overall mortality (10%) and incidence and/or mortality from cardiovascular diseases (9%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the past few decades, there has been a gradual abandonment of this dietary pattern by&#xD;
      the inhabitants of the Mediterranean basin, especially by the younger generations. Several&#xD;
      factors have contributed to this nutrition transition, such as the enhanced commercial&#xD;
      availability of food, the urbanization of life, and the overall improvement in socioeconomic&#xD;
      conditions in Europe, which has increased the food and energy supply and made food&#xD;
      (especially of animal origin) more affordable. Consumption of milk, meat and animal fat&#xD;
      products increased in all Mediterranean countries. Moreover, a stressful lifestyle, less time&#xD;
      spent on cooking, and the enhanced variety and availability of household appliances have also&#xD;
      been proposed as determinants of nutrition transition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the growing evidence in favor of link between red and processed meat and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease risk, cancer and diabetes, the interest towards vegetarian diets has&#xD;
      increased. In the last years, the number of subjects who began to adopt a vegetarian dietary&#xD;
      pattern has enormously increased with respect to the past, when the population of vegetarians&#xD;
      was limited only to few and selected cohorts. Such increase has been mainly attributed to the&#xD;
      supposed beneficial effect of this dietary pattern versus the occurrence of diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health benefits of Mediterranean and vegetarian diets have been widely described in&#xD;
      case-control and prospective cohort studies during the last 50 years. There are several&#xD;
      beneficial nutrients that are abundant in these diets, such as monounsaturated fatty acids,&#xD;
      high amounts of fiber and antioxidants and low intake of total and saturated fats. However,&#xD;
      it is unclear whether established health benefits for vegetarians are attributable to the&#xD;
      absence of meat in the diet, the increased consumption of particular food component(s) the&#xD;
      pattern of foods eaten within the vegetarian diet or other healthy lifestyle components often&#xD;
      associated with vegetarianism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent systematic review with meta-analysis carried out on over than 130,000&#xD;
      vegetarians, plant-based diet was associated with many health benefits. Main findings were&#xD;
      that vegetarian diet determines, among case-control studies, lower levels of the most&#xD;
      important risk factor for chronic disease, along with a reduced risk of occurrence for&#xD;
      ischemic heart disease (-25%) when cohort prospective studies were taken into account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there are no randomized controlled trials to compare, in a high-risk group of&#xD;
      patients with risk factors for cardiovascular disease, the efficacy of nutritional&#xD;
      interventions based on Mediterranean and vegetarian dietary patterns. From this comparison it&#xD;
      would may be possible to obtain interesting results in order to identify the optimal diet for&#xD;
      prevention of cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study is to compare the effects of vegetarian diet on risk markers&#xD;
      (anthropometric and biochemical measures) associated with cardio-metabolic diseases (CMD)&#xD;
      after a 3-month dietary-intervention phase, compared with a Mediterranean diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To improve knowledge about the pathophysiological role of vegetarian and Mediterranean&#xD;
           diets in cardiovascular prevention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the feasibility and degree of adherence to a dietary substitution with&#xD;
           vegetarian diet in a omnivorous population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the ability of a nutrition education intervention to reduce fresh and&#xD;
           processed meat consumption in subjects at high cardiovascular risk, in order to enhance&#xD;
           health and quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the impact of food prices on consumption and to evaluate the overall cost of&#xD;
           buying food products in different dietary patterns&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN The study is a randomized, open, cross-over trial designed to test whether a&#xD;
      vegetarian diet would benefit the cardiovascular risk profile of the participants, compared&#xD;
      with a Mediterranean diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eligible participants are randomly divided into two groups, each assigned to either the&#xD;
      experimental group (Group 1), which receives a vegetarian diet, or the control group (Group&#xD;
      2), which receives a Mediterranean diet. Following the first intervention phase, the subjects&#xD;
      are crossed over in order to obtain the second intervention phase. Both diets are isocaloric&#xD;
      and lasting three months each. The whole trial includes five clinical visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION Subjects in primary prevention with low-middle cardiovascular risk (1-5%&#xD;
      according to the guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology), determined by the&#xD;
      presence of BMI &gt;o=25 kg/m2 and no more than other 2 concomitant metabolic risk factors.&#xD;
