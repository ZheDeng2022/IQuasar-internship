  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will attempt to further increase the cure rate of ITP with medical therapy&#xD;
      by providing maintenance therapy with Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) to persistent/chronic ITP&#xD;
      patients after treating them with induction therapy combining rituximab and dexamethasone.&#xD;
      The investigators will randomly assign patients to MMF versus placebo in order to demonstrate&#xD;
      safety (e.g., for infectious risk) and efficacy (platelet counts stably &gt;50x109/L more than 1&#xD;
      year off therapy).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are significant numbers of Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP) patients 18 years of age or&#xD;
      older who relapse and become refractory after short responses to initial therapy (usually&#xD;
      corticosteroids) or who do not respond at all. Despite a variety of available therapies,&#xD;
      there are patients with persistently low platelet counts and bleeding complications, and&#xD;
      there are other patients who suffer from the side effects of current treatments. Thus, there&#xD;
      still remains an unmet need for better treatments in these patients. Based on the&#xD;
      investigators' experience, it is expected that most of ITP patients treated with intensive&#xD;
      induction therapy (Dexamethasone combined with rituximab, R+3D) will increase their platelet&#xD;
      counts, and the investigators hope that a further 6-month course of Mycophenolate Mofetil&#xD;
      will help patients to maintain continuous response and even achieve a cure of ITP. The&#xD;
      increase in platelet count will likely result in a decreased risk for bleeding and better&#xD;
      health-related quality of life. In addition, responders potentially will be able to stop&#xD;
      concomitant ITP medications and will not suffer from adverse events of various ITP therapies&#xD;
      and will avoid undergoing splenectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center, randomized study will help physicians determine the best treatment option&#xD;
      for ITP patients and may help to establish a new standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The knowledge to be gained is that of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. whether R+3D and placebo confirms the previous data on R+3D&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. whether R+3D + MMF increases the cure rate of ITP&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. whether R+3D + MMF increases the risk of serious infections&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators do not believe that the triple therapy will result in a high rate of&#xD;
      serious infections based on the past track record of R+3D and of MMF in combination with&#xD;
      other stronger immunosuppressive medications such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus. Therefore&#xD;
      the risk will be limited and worth the increase in cure rate that we expect.&#xD;
