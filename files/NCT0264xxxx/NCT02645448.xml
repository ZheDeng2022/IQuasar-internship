      The aim of this study was to investigate and correlate the glucose responses and VFC 24 hours&#xD;
      after resistance exercise (RE) sessions at different intensities in women with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes (DM-2). Twelve women with DM-2 were invited to perform by one week in randomized&#xD;
      order, two weeks interventions with experimental sessions: Session Control (CONT) without&#xD;
      conducting RE, RE session (40% or 80% of one maximum repetition - 1RM) on day 2 and day 3 was&#xD;
      observed the effect of the length of RE session by 11h. After that, initiated the&#xD;
      experimental sessions, where after each of the analysis of glucose 24h by continuous&#xD;
      monitoring system of glucose was performed, considering breakfast, lunch, dinner and sleep,&#xD;
      and analysis performed of the RR series by a period of 48h. During control sessions, the&#xD;
      subjects were seated comfortably for 40min and RE sessions, 40%1RM and 80%1RM, were performed&#xD;
      in medium circuit 3 sets with 16 and 8 replications and recovery range between 60 exercises&#xD;
      and 90seg , respectively, and between the circuits 120sec. It was observed that the&#xD;
      concentration of glucose in the period of 24h after the session has been reduced to 40% 1RM&#xD;
      vs. CONT and 80%1RM. Hyperglycemia was prevalent in the period 34h of the sessions CONT and&#xD;
      80%1RM, respectively , being different from the session 40%1RM. In postprandial times,&#xD;
      shorter hyperglycemia was found in the session to 40% 1RM vs. CONT and 80% 1RM after&#xD;
      breakfast, lunch and dinner. At the time of sleep, less time in hyperglycemia was found&#xD;
      between sessions of 40% 1RM vs. 80% 1RM. Significant correlations (p &lt;0.01) were found&#xD;
      between glucose 24h with cardiac autonomic RRi variables, HF, LF and reason LF:HF.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study was a randomized cross-by blocks in accordance with CONSORT (Schulz et al., 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total, 12 women with DM-2, between 48 and 60 years old participated in the study, where&#xD;
      they were informed of risks, benefits and objectives of the study and signed a consent form&#xD;
      Clarified (IC) previously approved by the Ethics Committee and Ethics in Research and Studies&#xD;
      (CEDEP) of the Federal University of São Francisco Valley (UNIVASF), Petrolina - PE, Brazil&#xD;
      (No. 0005/180814 CEDEP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of the participants, 11 were taking oral hypoglycemic medication (metformin [n = 7],&#xD;
      Sulphonylurea [n = 1] Metformin in combination with sulfonylurea [n = 3]) and performed only&#xD;
      dietary control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the first visit to the UNIVASF Exercise Physiology Laboratory, the participants&#xD;
      underwent a resting ECG examination, which could only be submitted to the test of a one&#xD;
      maximum repetition (1RM) and meetings after report of normality certified by cardiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the first visit to the lab, participants responded history about health history, physical&#xD;
      activity level and risk stratification. Subsequently were performed anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements of waist circumference, abdomen and hip, as well as height and body mass for&#xD;
      subsequent calculation of body mass index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two weeks before starting the intervention, participants underwent familiarization with the&#xD;
      exercise protocol for three alternate days. After 48 hours was performed the 1RM test in the&#xD;
      following exercises: bench press on the machine (pectoral and anterior deltoid muscle),&#xD;
      extensor chair (quadriceps muscle), Flying (pectoral muscle), flexor chair (muscle biceps&#xD;
      femoris, semitendinosus and semimembranosus), Pull High ahead (posterior muscles of the torso&#xD;
      and biceps), leg press (quadriceps and gluteus), sitting Remada (posterior muscles of the&#xD;
      torso and biceps) in equipment of Evidence® mark (Cachoerinha / RS - Brazil) and Physicus®&#xD;
      (Auriflama / SP - Brazil).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the 1RM test, participants received guidance in relation to food intake and the&#xD;
      practice of daily physical activity, and that, 48 hours before the first day of intervention,&#xD;
      do not ingest drinks contained alcohol and caffeine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the days of the sessions, participants fasted, they went to the lab, where they received a&#xD;
      standard breakfast containing 285 kcal, 45g and (180 kcal) carbohydrate, 6 g (24 kcal) of&#xD;
      protein and 9 g (81 kcal) of fat. Also they were asked to maintain the same diet during the&#xD;
      two-week intervention and record consumption in a food diary, which was later analyzed and&#xD;
      calculated by a trained nutritionist, using Microsoft Excel® software and the Brazilian Table&#xD;
      of Food Composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was also recommended that the main meals were taken at the same time of day (Breakfast&#xD;
      between 7:00 and 7:20h; lunch between 12:00h and 14:00h and Dinner between 18:00h and&#xD;
      20:00h). The energy intake and consumption of daily macronutrients did not differ between&#xD;
      sessions as shown in Table 2. During the days of intervention participants were instructed to&#xD;
      refrain from any exercise and / or strenuous physical labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The glucose sensor (Sof-sensor, Medtronic Minimed, Inc., Northridge, CA, USA) has been&#xD;
      installed the day before the first session being inserted following manufacturer's&#xD;
      instructions SMGG Guardian real-time (Medtronic Minimed, Inc., Northridge CA, USA), which&#xD;
      consists of a transmitter sensor inserted through a needle into the abdominal subcutaneous&#xD;
      tissue using a device (Sen-Seter, Medtronic Minimed, Inc., Northridge, CA, USA) and a monitor&#xD;
      for reading with wireless radio frequency sensor. This system has been validated in DM&#xD;
      control studies and complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the installation, there were appropriate calibration of the equipment following the&#xD;
      manufacturer's recommendations. During the monitoring period, capillary glucose samples were&#xD;
      collected using a glucose monitor (Accu-Check Performa, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany)&#xD;
      to calibrate the SMCG, being held four times every 24 hours monitoring by the researcher.&#xD;
      Participants were blinded with regard to measurements of SMCG and capillary glucose during&#xD;
      calibrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The glucose concentrations were analyzed on day 1 (24 hours analysis to observe the effect of&#xD;
      the control section), Day 2 (24h analysis to observe the effect of Resistance Exercise - RE&#xD;
      on different intensities) and day 3 (11h analysis of the duration of effect RE at different&#xD;
      intensities).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the autonomic modulation is adopted the frequency meter of Polar® RS800CX model&#xD;
      (Electo Oy, Kempele, Finland) with proven validity and reproducibility (Essner et al, 2013;&#xD;
      Jonckheer-SHEEHY et al, 2012.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigated autonomic indicators were: 1) straight-time domain from absolute average&#xD;
      records of RR intervals (RRi) and; 2) the frequency domain method for spectral analysis by&#xD;
      Fast Fourier Transformer (low frequency - LF normalized units as a marker of sympathetic&#xD;
      activity, high frequency - HF also with normalized units as a marker of vagal activity, and&#xD;
      the LF:. HF as a marker of sympathovagal balance). All indexes are described by the European&#xD;
      Society of Cardiology (TASK FORCE HEART Variability, 1996) and all Analyses were performed in&#xD;
      Kubios HRV Analysis Software version 2.0 (Biosignal Laboratory, University of Kuopio,&#xD;
      Finland).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants took part in a randomized experimental study, which consisted of two&#xD;
      intervention periods, with each period consisted of three days where on day 1 a control&#xD;
      session (CONT) was held, day 2 to RE session (40% 1RM or 80% 1RM), day 3 to check the&#xD;
      duration of the effect of exercise. Each intervention aimed to assess the impact of a workout&#xD;
      on glycemic control in standardized food and free living conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially the participants arrived at the laboratory in fasting at 7: 00 and at that time was&#xD;
      provided to them a standardized breakfast containing 285kcal, breakfast period was between 7:&#xD;
      00 - 7: 20h. After this period, the volunteers were instructed again on the subsequent power&#xD;
      the sessions and even at that time, the frequency meter Polar RS800CX has been installed for&#xD;
      reading RRi during and post-session, totaling 24 hours of Heart Rate Variability (HRV)&#xD;
      measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant performed four sessions: CONT, ER 40% 1RM and ER 80% 1RM, and the RE&#xD;
      sessions at different intensities randomized by blocks, in food standardization and&#xD;
      abstention from other types of exercise, but free living conditions while using SMCG polar&#xD;
      and frequency meter. In each session glycemic and autonomic responses were analyzed by a&#xD;
      24-hour period started at each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All sessions lasted 60 minutes, consisting of 20 minutes of a pre-intervention period (rest)&#xD;
      and control session 40min (day1) and session RE (day 2), and were performed at the same time&#xD;
      of day between 8:00 and 9:00. During all sessions the participants were already under the&#xD;
      glucose monitoring and VFC. At the end of each session, participants were released to daily&#xD;
      routine always under the use of SMCG and frequency meter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental sessions were distributed in two weeks, being held on the 1st of each week a&#xD;
      control session and on day 2 an RE session (40% 1RM and 80% 1RM). On day 3 no intervention&#xD;
      was only observed for a period of 11h monitoring, the possible duration of the ER effect in&#xD;
      the preceding day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-intervention: Before any intervention, the participants remained seated in the laboratory&#xD;
      for a period of 20 minutes in a quiet room without interference from noise and temperature&#xD;
      between 23-24ºC (SOUZA et al, 2013.). During this period, every 5 minutes, the concentrations&#xD;
      of glucose through the SMCG and RRi through the frequency meter were obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The intensities of RE have been established based on the classification of the&#xD;
      American College Sport Medicine and American Diabetes Association for individuals with DM-2,&#xD;
      and categorized the low intensity with 40% 1RM and high intensity exercise with 80% 1RM&#xD;
      (Colberg et al., 2010). RE sessions 40% and 80% 1RM addition control section (no RE) lasted&#xD;
      40 minutes each. For RE sessions it was held three circuits with 7 exercise each, in the same&#xD;
      sequence the 1RM test (the machine bench press, leg extension Chair, Flying, flexor chair,&#xD;
      high Pull ahead, leg press, seated row). For RE session at 40% 1RM were performed 16&#xD;
      repetitions of each exercise with an interval of 60 seconds between them and 120 seconds&#xD;
      between circuits. For RE session at 80% 1RM were performed 08 repetitions of each exercise&#xD;
      with an interval of 90 seconds between them and 120 seconds between circuits. The duration&#xD;
      repeat the exercise both 40% and 80% 1RM was 3 seconds, 1 second in the concentric phase and&#xD;
      2 seconds in the eccentric phase of the movement. In CONT sessions participants remained&#xD;
      seated in a comfortable chair, being in the same room of the ER sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-intervention: At the end of each session the participants were released to daily&#xD;
      routine, being oriented to record daily food intake (day 1) and equalize the same consumption&#xD;
      in the following days (days 2 and 3) during the two weeks of intervention. Also, avoid&#xD;
      performing exercises of any nature and make use of the medication in the same way in periods&#xD;
      of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were expressed as mean ± SD (standard deviation). Data normality was confirmed by the&#xD;
      Shapiro-Wilk test. The glucose values were used to determine the average concentration of&#xD;
      glucose and the prevalence of hyperglycemia (blood glucose concentrations exceeded 160&#xD;
      mg.dL-1) both in 24 and in the postprandial different times: breakfast (08: 00 - 12: 00),&#xD;
      lunch (13:00h - 18:00h), dinner (19:00h - 23:00h) and sleep (23:00h - 06:00h). Analysis of&#xD;
      variance one way (ANOVA) with repeated measures was performed to determine differences in&#xD;
      experimental conditions (CONT x 40% x 80% 1RM). Post-hoc Tukey's pair for identification of&#xD;
      differences was used as an 'F' mean was obtained. Pearson's linear correlation test was also&#xD;
      adopted to investigate the association between glucose and HRV. Significance was set at p&#xD;
      confidence level &lt;0.05. All statistical calculations were performed using the STATISTICA&#xD;
      software for Windows v. 6.0 (StatSoft, Inc.)&#xD;
