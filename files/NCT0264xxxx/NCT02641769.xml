    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single arm, single center investigation to assess the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of purified adult autologous bone marrow derived CD34+, CD133+, and mesenchymal stem&#xD;
      cells injected into the seminiferous tubules and testis, through a 12 week follow-up period.&#xD;
      The investigators' selected model of research is based on maximizing the efficiency of the&#xD;
      approach by choosing an autologous pattern which preserves the genetic make-up of an&#xD;
      individual that is vital in infertility conditions. Additionally the approach involves&#xD;
      injecting a combination of different but purified cell types which all aid in the retrieval&#xD;
      of spermatogenesis, and the generation of mature spermatozoa. Expected outcomes of this study&#xD;
      are defined in general improvements in infertile patients in regards of testicular&#xD;
      morphology, sexual function, semen quality, development of primary or secondary&#xD;
      spermatocytes, spermatids, or mature spermatozoa in the testis, seminiferous tubules, or&#xD;
      semen.&#xD;

      Non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) is generally considered a non-medically manageable cause of&#xD;
      male infertility. These patients, who constitute up to 10% of all infertile men, have&#xD;
      abnormal spermatogenesis as the cause of their azoospermia. The etiology affecting&#xD;
      approximately 60% of azoospermic men, includes non-obstructive causes of azoospermia,&#xD;
      including toxic exposures or abnormal testicular development. NOA results from either primary&#xD;
      testicular failure (elevated Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH),&#xD;
      small testes affecting up to 10% of men presenting with infertility), secondary testicular&#xD;
      failure (congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with decreased LH and FSH, small testes),&#xD;
      or incomplete or ambiguous testicular failure (either increased FSH and normal volume testes,&#xD;
      normal FSH and small testes, or normal FSH and normal testis volume). Prior to microsurgical&#xD;
      testicular sperm retrieval techniques and IVF/ICSI, donor insemination was the only option&#xD;
      available to men with NOA. The establishment of in vitro fertilization using intracytoplasmic&#xD;
      sperm injection (ICSI) as a standard treatment modality has resulted in a number of these men&#xD;
      successfully fathering a child through surgically retrieved sperm from the testis. The&#xD;
      challenge, however, is to improve their spermatogenic function to enable the appearance of&#xD;
      sperm in their ejaculate or to improve the chances of a successful retrieval from the testis&#xD;
      for ICSI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial evaluation aims at resolving the following issues: (1) confirming azoospermia,&#xD;
      (2) differentiating obstructive from non-obstructive etiology, (3) assessing for the presence&#xD;
      of reversible factors and (4) evaluating for the presence of genetic abnormalities. An&#xD;
      elevated follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level or an absence of normal spermatogenesis by&#xD;
      testicular histology in the presence of azoospermia is generally considered sufficient&#xD;
      evidence of a non-obstructive etiology. The most common reversible factors that need to be&#xD;
      ruled out include recent exogenous hormone administration, severe febrile illnesses,&#xD;
      chemotherapy/radiation or prolonged antibiotic use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During past few years a considerable progress in the derivation of male germ cells from&#xD;
      pluripotent stem cells has been made. These studies provide a desirable experimental model&#xD;
      for elucidating underlying molecular mechanism of male germ cell development and potential&#xD;
      strategies for producing haploid germ cells for the treatment of male infertility.&#xD;
      Spermatogenesis is a complex process by which spermatogonial stem cells (SSC) self-renew and&#xD;
      differentiate into haploid spermatozoa. In mammals, this process takes place in the&#xD;
      seminiferous tubules of testis, which provide a functional niche for male germ cells and&#xD;
      involve three major stages: mitosis, meiosis, and spermiogenesis. Errors at any stage of&#xD;
      spermatogenesis can result in subfertility and infertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers are currently developing alternative treatment options for these men involving&#xD;
      stem cells. It has been verified that mouse induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can form&#xD;
      functional spermatozoa. Functional assays have shown that spermatozoa generated from iPSCs&#xD;
      were capable of fertilizing the oocytes after intracytoplasmatic injection and giving rise to&#xD;
      fertile offspring following embryo transfer. So far, functional male gametes from human iPSCs&#xD;
      have not been obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two possible approaches in generating of male germ cells from pluripotent stem&#xD;
      cells: in vitro differentiation into advanced, haploid cell products or combined in vitro&#xD;
      differentiation and in vivo transplantation. However, the originality of this study is&#xD;
      illustrated in the transplantation of purified autologous CD34+/CD133+ and mesenchymal bone&#xD;
      marrow stem cells (BMSCs) into infertile patients without in vitro breeding, culture, or&#xD;
      manipulation thus avoiding in vitro cell propagation risks as genetic mutations and DNA&#xD;
      changes. The cells are withdrawn and injected back into the patient on the very same day of&#xD;
      the procedure, hence conferring the highest safety and efficacy parameters.&#xD;
