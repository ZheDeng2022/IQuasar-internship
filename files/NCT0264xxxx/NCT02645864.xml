  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer is one of the common malignant tumors. The annual incidence of esophageal&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma is 260,000 with the mortality of 210,000 in China. Different from&#xD;
      that in western countries, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is still the dominant&#xD;
      pathological type in China and account for more than 95% cases in clinic. The prognosis of&#xD;
      ESCC is very poor. About 50% of patients have advanced disease at diagnosis with a 5-year&#xD;
      survival rate of only 5-7%. Though esophagectomy is standard treatment, disease will relapse&#xD;
      in many patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with unresectable or recurrent disease, chemotherapy is an important treatment&#xD;
      alone or with radiotherapy. Taxane, platinum, and fluoropyrimidine have been reported&#xD;
      effective in ESCC and is popularly used in first-line treatment of ESCC. However, there is&#xD;
      still no standard 2nd-line treatment for patients who fail in first-line treatment. Both&#xD;
      irinotecan and taxane had been studied as 2nd-line treatment for esophageal cancer patients.&#xD;
      But there are only a few of ESCC patients involved in those studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Except for chemotherapy, targeting treatment is another promising treatment for esophageal&#xD;
      cancer. In recent years, antiangiogenic treatment has been proved to be effective and&#xD;
      tolerable in many cancers such lung, colorectal, and gastric cancer. Apatinib is an also&#xD;
      known as YN968D1, is an orally antiangiogenic agents. Preclinical and clinical data has shown&#xD;
      that it is effective in the treatment of a variety of solid tumors including esophageal&#xD;
      cancer. And it was approved and launched in China in 2014 as a 3rd-line treatment for&#xD;
      patients with advanced gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, investigators initialize this dose escalation phase I study to explore the safety&#xD;
      of irinotecan and apatinib combination treatment in ESCC patients with relapse disease after&#xD;
      esophagectomy and failure in 1st-line chemotherapy. Investigators will analyze the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MDT) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in this study.&#xD;

    <description>This study will include a sequential evaluation of 3 subjects per cohort. Cohort 1: apatinib 250 mg per day and irinotecan 150mg q2w. Cohort 2: apatinib 500 mg per day and irinotecan 150mg q2w. Cohort 3: apatinib 750 mg per day and irinotecan 150mg q2w.&#xD;
A dose limiting toxicity (DLT) event is defined as any of the following events:&#xD;
CTCAE Grade 4 event&#xD;
Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity including fever, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea that continues despite optimal medical management) If a DLT is experienced in any cohort, the cohort will be expanded to 6 subjects. If two (2) DLTs are experienced in any cohort, the study will stop and the dose of combination treatment in this cohort will be documented.</description>
