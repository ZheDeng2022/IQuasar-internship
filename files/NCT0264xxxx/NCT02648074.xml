      Asthma is a chronic, inflammatory disease of the lung characterized by intermittent airway&#xD;
      obstruction, airway hyperresponsiveness, presence of activated inflammatory cells,&#xD;
      inflammatory mediators, and airway structural changes. Airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells&#xD;
      actively participate in the remodelling and inflammatory processes through proliferation,&#xD;
      release of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins.&#xD;
      Eosinophils as essential inflammatory cells may be of importance in ASM remodelling. It is&#xD;
      known that eosinophil induces ASM cells proliferation via the secretion of cysteinyl&#xD;
      leukotrienes in asthmatics. However there is a possible direct eosinophil-ASM cells&#xD;
      functional interaction by adhesion processes. It has been shown that integrins modulate ASM&#xD;
      proliferation and contractile protein expression demonstrating allergen-induced ASM&#xD;
      remodelling in an animal model of allergic asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wingless/integrase-1 (WNT) signaling regulates not only a wide range of developmental&#xD;
      processes, but its aberrant activation can lead to disease. Recently, it was confirmed that&#xD;
      genes polymorphisms in the WNT signaling pathway are associated with impaired lung function&#xD;
      in childhood asthma. It was also found for the first time a relevant role of noncanonical WNT&#xD;
      signaling in TGFβ-induced ECM expression by ASM cells and identified WNT-5A is the most&#xD;
      abundant WNT ligand with increased expression in asthmatics. It demonstrates that WNT-5A&#xD;
      could contribute to remodelling of the airways. Unfortunately, the effect of eosinophil on&#xD;
      WNT secretion by ASM cells at present is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the widely acknowledged significance of eosinophils in asthma pathogenesis, the&#xD;
      mechanism of eosinophil induced ASM remodelling is unsolved.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic, inflammatory disease of the lung characterized by intermittent airway&#xD;
      obstruction, airway hyperresponsiveness, presence of activated inflammatory cells,&#xD;
      inflammatory mediators, and remodeling in the airway. Airway remodeling characterizes as the&#xD;
      cellular and structural changes in the airways, mainly resulting from repair processes in&#xD;
      response to persistent inflammation. It is generally accepted that airway remodeling is&#xD;
      closely related to the progression of airway hyperresponsiveness and the severity of asthma.&#xD;
      The structural changes in the airway include airway smooth muscle (ASM) hypertrophy and&#xD;
      hyperplasia, collagen deposition to the sub-epithelial basement membrane, hyperplasia of&#xD;
      goblet cells, thickening of the airway mucosa and an increase in vascularity (Aceves and&#xD;
      Broide, 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Airway remodelling mostly is derived from airway inflammation, where eosinophils play a key&#xD;
      role. The effect of intact eosinophils on ASM cells within a physiological context first time&#xD;
      was investigated by Halwani with colleagues (2013). They found that prevention contact of&#xD;
      eosinophils with ASM cells using specific antibodies or blocking cysteinyl leukotrienes was&#xD;
      associated with inhibition of ASM proliferation in asthmatics. Moreover, Fanat et al. (2009)&#xD;
      demonstrated that ASM-derived cytokines directly affect the eosinophils differentiation and&#xD;
      maturation from progenitor cells, which can maintain airway eosinophilic inflammation and&#xD;
      consequently the tissue remodelling in asthma. Furthermore, eosinophil deficient mice are&#xD;
      protected from airway remodeling including collagen deposition and smooth muscle thickening&#xD;
      (Humbles et al Science 2004, 305:1776-9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eosinophils seem to contribute to airway remodelling in several ways, including through&#xD;
      release of eosinophil-derived mediators such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, secretion&#xD;
      of cationic proteins, and cytokines, as well as through interactions with inflammatory and&#xD;
      structural cells (Kariyawasam and Robinson, 2007; Aceves and Broide, 2008; Venge, 2010).&#xD;
      Eosinophil-derived cytokines are in the modulation of Th2 responses that trigger macrophage&#xD;
      production of TGF-β1, which serves as a stimulus for extracellular matrix (ECM) production&#xD;
      (Fanta et al., 1999; Holgate, 2001). Masu et al. (2002) confirmed the proliferative effects&#xD;
      of eosinophils lysates isolated from healthy donors on ASM cells. However, there is a&#xD;
      possible direct eosinophil-ASM cells functional interaction by adhesion processes.&#xD;
      Interaction of cells is mediated through integrins, a group of heterodimeric transmembrane&#xD;
      glycoproteins (Hynes, 2002). Each integrin interacts or potentially interacts with&#xD;
      counter-receptors on other cells or ligands deposited as part of the ECM (Humphries et al.,&#xD;
      2006). The communication between eosinophil and ASM cells is not fully understood. Several&#xD;
      integrins are expressed by eosinophils (α4β1, α6β1, αLβ2, αMβ2, αXβ2, αDβ2, α4β7) and ASM&#xD;
      cell (α1β1, α2β1, α3β1, α4β1, α5β1, α6β1, α6β4, α7β1, α8β1, α9β1, αvβ1, αvβ3, αvβ5) (Teoh at&#xD;
      al., 2012; Johansson and Mosher, 2013). It has been shown that integrins modulate ASM&#xD;
      proliferation and contractile protein expression demonstrating allergen-induced ASM&#xD;
      remodeling in an animal model of allergic asthma (Bart et al., 2010). Furthermore, several&#xD;
      ASM derived integrins can function to activate latent TGF-beta into active TGF-beta in&#xD;
      asthmatic airway smooth muscle (Tatler et al J Immunol 2011, 187:6094-107). Eosinophil&#xD;
      integrins have the potential to mediate adhesion to endothelium in asthma (Barthel et al.,&#xD;
      2008). Further studies indicate that integrins mediate trafficking of eosinophils to the lung&#xD;
      and persistence in the ECM of the bronchi in models of allergen-induced acute and chronic&#xD;
      asthma (Banerjee et al., 2007, 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wingless/integrase-1 (WNT) signalling regulates not only a wide range of developmental&#xD;
      processes, but its aberrant activation can lead to disease. Up-regulation of several members&#xD;
      of the WNT signalling pathway in the lungs of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and&#xD;
      other interstitial lung diseases has been demonstrated (Selman et al., 2006; Königshoff et&#xD;
      al., 2008). More recently, Sharma et al. (2010) have confirmed that genes polymorphisms in&#xD;
      the WNT signalling pathway are associated with impaired lung function in childhood asthma.&#xD;
      Kumawat et al. (2013) for the first time reported a relevant role of noncanonical WNT&#xD;
      signalling in TGFβ-induced extracellular matrix (ECM) expression by ASM cells and identified&#xD;
      WNT-5A is the most abundant WNT ligand in ASM cells with increased expression in asthmatics.&#xD;
      This is in line with Choy et al. (2011) who report that airway biopsies from Th2 high asthma&#xD;
      patients have increased WNT-5A expression. Higher expression of WNT-5A in ASM cells&#xD;
      demonstrates that WNT-5A could contribute to remodelling of the airways. Despite the reported&#xD;
      role of WNT in airway remodelling, the regulation of WNT secretion by eosinophils or by&#xD;
      eosinophil-ASM interactions is at present unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the widely acknowledged significance of eosinophils in asthma pathogenesis, the&#xD;
      mechanism for eosinophil mediated airway remodeling is unsolved. At present understanding of&#xD;
      eosinophils interaction and effect on ASM cells in asthma remains elusive. Therefore the&#xD;
      nature of the interplay between these two cells types and the consequence of it needs to be&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the Project: to assess the eosinophil mediated airway remodeling in asthma.&#xD;
