      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of metformin for treatment&#xD;
      antipsychotic-induced metabolic syndrome in bipolar disorder patients.&#xD;

      Patients aged 18 to 45 years with bipolar disorder diagnosed in accordance with criteria set&#xD;
      out in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders- Fourth Edition (DSM-IV)&#xD;
      were eligible for our study, and the Structured Clinical Interview of DSM-IV Axis I Disorders&#xD;
      (SCID-1), Clinical Version, was used during the screening phase. To be qualified for this&#xD;
      study, patients had to meet, 1) have experienced metabolic syndrome as defined below within&#xD;
      the first year of treatment with one of four antipsychotics-clozapine, olanzapine,&#xD;
      risperidone, or sulpiride; 2) had been either discharged from inpatient units or first visit&#xD;
      in the outpatient clinic in the 12 months before enrollment, and their glucose and lipid&#xD;
      levels, weight, blood pressure and antipsychotic treatment were documented; 3) had taken&#xD;
      single antipsychotic medication, with no more than a 25% change in dosage, over the past 3&#xD;
      months. All participants had to be under the care of a parent or another adult caregiver who&#xD;
      monitored and recorded the intake of medication daily during the trial to assure the&#xD;
      adherence to medication. Patients were excluded from the study if there was evidence of liver&#xD;
      or renal dysfunction, cardiovascular disease, or diabetes mellitus; or if they were pregnant&#xD;
      or lactating; or had any psychiatric diagnosis other than schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome was the level of LDL-C or the percentage of patients who had LDL-C&#xD;
      greater or equal 3.37mmol/L (130mg/dl). The secondary outcomes were fasting triglyceride,&#xD;
      total cholesterol, HDL-C, insulin and glucose levels, insulin resistance index, body weight&#xD;
      and body mass index, as well as incidence of adverse events. Body mass index was calculated&#xD;
      as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. Insulin resistance index was&#xD;
      calculated based on the homeostasis model assessment as: fasting insulin (mIU/L)Ã—fasting&#xD;
      glucose (mmol/L)/22.5. the assessment was conducted by members of a trained independent&#xD;
      research team connected to the centre. Inclusion or exclusion was decided by the team. After&#xD;
      a complete description of the study to the subjects, written informed consent was obtained in&#xD;
      accordance with National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines.&#xD;
