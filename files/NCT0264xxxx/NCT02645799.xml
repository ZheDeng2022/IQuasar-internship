  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to assess the safety, efficacy and dose response of&#xD;
      LABR-312 administered intravenously at the time of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)&#xD;
      with a drug eluting stent in reducing restenosis as measured by Optical Coherence Tomography&#xD;
      (OCT) at 9 months post procedure in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of LABR-312 at the time of PCI will reduce restenosis compared with placebo as&#xD;
      assessed by the OCT endpoint of % neointimal hyperplasia (%NIH) volume at 9 months in&#xD;
      patients with DM.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IIb, prospective, multi-center, multi-national, randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      two-arm, 1:1 (escalating dose LABR-312 vs. placebo) clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both study arms, all target lesions will be treated with the Resolute Integrity Drug&#xD;
      Eluting Stent during the index PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lesions that are planned to be treated must be declared and recorded at the time of&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified by the presence or absence of insulin treatment, HbA1c level&#xD;
      (&lt;7.5% vs. ≥7.5%), and by pre-procedure monocyte count (≥500/uL or below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects (n=~270) will be randomized to receive either the study drug LABR-312 or the&#xD;
      placebo. Conditionally to ongoing safety monitoring, dose escalation of LABR-312 in the study&#xD;
      arm will be performed: 0.01 mg (first 45 patients vs. 45 patients receiving placebo), up to&#xD;
      0.03 mg (next consecutive 45 patients vs. 45 patients receiving placebo) and up to 0.08 mg&#xD;
      (final 45 consecutive patients vs. 45 patients receiving placebo). If a decision is made not&#xD;
      to dose escalate, recruitment will continue with the highest dose level deemed safe by the&#xD;
      ongoing safety monitoring, until approximately 270 subjects are randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the LABR-312 group, 3 doses will therefore be tested, resulting in 6 possibilities:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Low dose 0.01 mg LABR-312 or equivalent volume of placebo (saline) administered IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Intermediate dose Up to 0.03 mg LABR-312 or equivalent volume of placebo (saline)&#xD;
      administered IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3: High dose Up to 0.08 mg LABR-312 or equivalent volume of placebo (saline)&#xD;
      administered IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of subject participation will be 1 year; clinical follow-up will be performed at&#xD;
      30 days, 9 months, and 1year post randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OCT follow-up will be performed at 9 months.&#xD;

             symptoms must have a positive stress test, FFR ≤0.80, or angiographic stenosis of&#xD;
             ≥70%), NSTEMI, or recent STEMI (&gt;7 days from procedure).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Non-target vessel PCI are allowed prior to randomization depending on the time&#xD;
             interval and conditions as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  During Baseline Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  PCI of non-target vessels performed during the baseline procedure itself&#xD;
                  immediately prior to randomization, if successful and uncomplicated, defined as:&#xD;
                  &lt;50% visually estimated residual diameter stenosis, TIMI Grade 3 flow, no&#xD;
                  dissection ≥ NHLBI type C, no perforation, no persistent ST segment changes, no&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  In cases where non-target lesion PCI has occurred 24-72 hours prior to the&#xD;
                  baseline procedure, at least 2 sets of cardiac biomarkers must be drawn at least&#xD;
                  6 and 12 hours after the non-target vessel PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If cardiac biomarkers are initially elevated above the local laboratory upper&#xD;
                  limit of normal, serial measurements must demonstrate that the biomarkers are&#xD;
                  falling.&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. All non-target lesions (i.e. those not meeting angiographic criteria for the study)&#xD;
             should be treated prior to randomization. All target lesions must be planned to be&#xD;
             treated during the index procedure. The investigator will declare which target lesions&#xD;
             are intended for treatment at the time of randomization. In the event that all target&#xD;
             lesions cannot be treated (e.g. due to contrast load), staged procedure should be&#xD;
             delayed preferably at least 2 weeks after the index PCI, and those lesions will be&#xD;
             considered non-target lesions. Any such planned staged lesions must be declared at the&#xD;
             end of the index procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Prior target-vessel PCI is allowed if it occurred ≥6 months prior to randomization and&#xD;
             no restenosis is present, or if re-intervention is planned on the restenotic lesion(s)&#xD;
