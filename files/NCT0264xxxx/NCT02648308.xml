    <textblock>
      Results from the 5As Team (5AsT) Study have identified critical gaps in medical school&#xD;
      curricula on obesity, leading to a wave of new family physicians who lack confidence and are&#xD;
      poorly equipped to manage obesity with their patients. In an effort to address this gap, all&#xD;
      first year medical residents training in family medicine at the University of Alberta during&#xD;
      the 2015/2016 year will be required to take a 2 day workshop in Obesity Management as part of&#xD;
      the Doctor-Patient Relationship Course. The comprehensive workshop provides medical residents&#xD;
      with knowledge and training in obesity prevention and management through didactic lectures,&#xD;
      experiential learning, and clinical practice. Participants were asked to complete and submit&#xD;
      pre- and post- workshop assessment measuring self-reported confidence on aspects of weight&#xD;
      management counselling, narrative reflections regarding the experiential components of the&#xD;
      course, and measures to assess beliefs and attitudes towards people living with obesity. The&#xD;
      purpose of our program evaluation was to assess the program's impact on residents' knowledge&#xD;
      of obesity and attitude towards counselling patients with obesity, as well as to refine and&#xD;
      further develop the course. Evaluation of the 5AsT-MD pilot project shows increases of&#xD;
      residents' understanding of the complexity and chronicity of obesity, and an uptake of the&#xD;
      5As framework and tools by residents to improve confidence and success of their weight&#xD;
      management practice.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity is a complex chronic condition that negatively impacts individuals, society, and the&#xD;
      healthcare system. Family physicians are one of many health practitioners tasked with the&#xD;
      long-term care of patients with obesity and its associated co-morbidities. However, focus&#xD;
      groups conducted by the 5As Team (5AsT) have identified critical gaps in medical school&#xD;
      curricula on obesity, leading to a wave of new family physicians who are unconfident and&#xD;
      poorly equipped to manage obesity with their patients. To address this education gap, the 5As&#xD;
      team developed a comprehensive training module on obesity management for family medicine&#xD;
      residents at the University of Alberta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aimed to evaluate the impact of this course on the residents' attitudes and&#xD;
      beliefs about obesity, as well as confidence levels using key aspects of the 5As of obesity&#xD;
      management to help their patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on focus groups conducted with medical students and practicing physicians during a&#xD;
      summer project, a list of learning objectives was made to address known deficiencies in&#xD;
      obesity education. These learning objectives were adapted to a two-day training module on&#xD;
      obesity management for first year family medicine residents. All 2015/2016 and 2016/2017&#xD;
      first year medical residents were required to take a 2 day Obesity Management Workshop as&#xD;
      part of their Doctor-Patient Relationship course. Prior to the workshop, residents were asked&#xD;
      to complete a pre-workshop assessment which asked them to rate their level of confidence&#xD;
      counselling patients on several aspects of obesity management. In addition, residents&#xD;
      enrolled in the year 2015/2016 were asked to complete the Attitudes Toward Obese Persons&#xD;
      (ATOP) and Beliefs About Obese Persons BAOP questionnaires, residents enrolled in the&#xD;
      2016/2017 year were asked to complete the NEW Attitudes Scale. The first day consisted of&#xD;
      didactic lectures on the basic pathophysiology of obesity, obesity management in pediatrics&#xD;
      and pregnancy, and an introduction to the 5As of obesity management. Residents were also&#xD;
      given the opportunity to experience wearing a bariatric suit in a simulated living&#xD;
      environment after which they were asked to complete their first narrative reflection&#xD;
      assignment. The second day of the workshop consisted of didactic lectures on lifestyle&#xD;
      management and bariatric surgery, followed by practice sessions with standardized patients.&#xD;
      Residents were then asked to find a patient with lived experience in their own clinic and&#xD;
      practice using the 5As approach with their own patient and then complete their second&#xD;
      narrative reflection assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Residents were informed about the 5AsT MD2 study on the first day of the 2-day workshop and&#xD;
      asked if they would like to participate. If a resident declined to participate, they were&#xD;
      still able to take part in the workshop and were still required to complete the course&#xD;
      assignments listed above, however, their course materials were not provided to the research&#xD;
      team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those residents who consented to participate in the study, were asked to place their required&#xD;
      course materials into a sealed envelope and will then submit them to a neutral, third party.&#xD;
      The neutral, third party was an employee in the Department of Family Medicine and had no&#xD;
      responsibilities with regards to evaluation of the medical residents. The neutral, third&#xD;
      party recorded that the resident had completed their assignment for the course, assigned an&#xD;
      Identification (ID) number to each resident and labelled each document as well as the&#xD;
      envelope with the resident's ID number. Using a paper cutter, the neutral, third party&#xD;
      removed the resident's name from each document. A master list was kept by the neutral, third&#xD;
      party, which allowed her to track which ID number corresponded to which resident so that she&#xD;
      could appropriately label all of the post-workshop documents with the resident's assigned ID&#xD;
      number. Only the neutral, third party had access to the master last with the residents names.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the workshop on the second day, the residents who consented to participate, were&#xD;
      asked to submit their post-workshop course materials, in a sealed envelope, to the neutral&#xD;
      third party. The neutral, third party recorded that the resident completed their assignment&#xD;
      for the course, labelled their documents and envelope with the correct ID number and then&#xD;
      removed the resident's name from the documents. The de-identified materials of those&#xD;
      residents who consented to participate were given to study staff. The narrative reflective&#xD;
      exercises for both part 1 and part 2 of the workshop were due 2 weeks post-workshop event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants completed the validated ATOP (Attitudes Toward Obese Persons) and BAOP (Beliefs&#xD;
      About Obese Persons) questionnaires, as well as pre- and post- workshop assessment&#xD;
      questionnaires to measure their level of confidence in performing key aspects of obesity&#xD;
      management. All questionnaires were de-identified, but responses were tracked both before and&#xD;
      after the training module to quantify the change seen in each study participant. Participants&#xD;
      also wrote two de-identified narrative reflections to be used for qualitative analysis. The&#xD;
      first was on the weight bias bariatric suit experience, and the second was on the application&#xD;
      of the lessons of the workshop in clinical practice.&#xD;
