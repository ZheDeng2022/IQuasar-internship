      Embryo adhesion and placentation depend on tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-mediated&#xD;
      activation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor and other&#xD;
      growth factors, formation of hemidesmosomes, and degradation of extracellular matrix and&#xD;

&#xD;
      Since glucose and insulin stimulate release of a major tPA inhibitor by endothelial cells -&#xD;
      plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 - the investigators hypothesized that lifestyle&#xD;

      range would increase the take home baby rate in women undergoing assisted reproduction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has a well-known role in the coagulation pathway. tPA&#xD;
      converts plasminogen to plasmin. Plasmin dissolves fibrin clots, thus limiting thrombus&#xD;
      formation to the site of vascular injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the extravascular compartment, tPA is a pivotal mediator of tissue formation and&#xD;
      remodeling. Due to its proteolytic activity, tPA participates in processes as diverse as&#xD;
      embryo adhesion, placental angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, and neuronal plasticity. Embryo&#xD;
      adhesion and placentation, for example, depend on tPA-mediated activation of brain-derived&#xD;
      neurotrophic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor and other growth factors, formation&#xD;
      of hemidesmosomes, and degradation of extracellular matrix and basement membrane, either&#xD;
      directly or by activating matrix metalloproteinases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming low tPA activity would impair both blood clot dissolution and placentation, the&#xD;
      investigators postulated that patients with consecutive first-trimester abortions would have&#xD;
      a high prevalence of severe dysmenorrhea, accompanied by the passage of large clots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2011, the investigators assessed the prevalence of severe dysmenorrhea during early&#xD;
      adolescence in two groups. The first one was made of women with ≥ 2 consecutive&#xD;
      first-trimester abortions, and the other, of women with ≥ 2 living births, and no losses or&#xD;
      preterm deliveries. Severe dysmenorrhea was defined as suprapubic menstrual cramp, intense&#xD;
      enough to cause repeated absenteeism from school or fainting in the absence of analgesia.&#xD;
      Early adolescents are unlikely to use contraceptives, or to have become pregnant, two&#xD;
      situations that may reduce the pain. In this study, severe dysmenorrhea increased the chances&#xD;
      of having consecutive first-trimester miscarriages by sevenfold (95% Confidence Interval: 3.4&#xD;
      to 14.1; p&lt;0.001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since glucose and insulin stimulate release of a major tPA inhibitor by endothelial cells -&#xD;
      plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 - the investigators hypothesized that lifestyle&#xD;
      interventions proven effective in maintaining glucose and insulin levels within the normal&#xD;
      range would increase the take home baby rate in women undergoing assisted reproduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol has already been tested at a Brazilian tertiary care center in women with&#xD;
      unexplained consecutive first-trimester abortions, conceiving spontaneously. The objective of&#xD;
      this study was to observe the impact of lifestyle interventions on the take home baby rate,&#xD;
      and to observe if the intervention could reduce the prevalence of preeclampsia and neonatal&#xD;
      hypoglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From 2011 to 2015, 480 patients aged 18 to 42 years with ≥ 2 consecutive first-trimester&#xD;
      abortions documented by pathology or ultrasonography, were randomly assigned to protocol&#xD;
      Walking and Diet (W+D) or to standard follow-up (controls). Women were enrolled independent&#xD;
      of having had severe dysmenorrhea during adolescence. Patients assigned to protocol W+D were&#xD;
      instructed to walk briskly for ≥ 40 minutes seven days a week. In addition, they were&#xD;
      recommended to avoid high-carbohydrate meals such as snacks, candies, fiber-free juices,&#xD;
      coconut water and sugar-sweetened beverages, and to eat two daily servings of meat, poultry,&#xD;
      fish (e.g. 2 g/kg) or other protein-rich food, starting when they decided to get pregnant and&#xD;
      continuing until delivery. Women with antiphospholipid antibodies, second- or third-trimester&#xD;
      losses, multiple pregnancies, anatomical abnormalities that could increase the risk of&#xD;
      first-trimester abortions, or any condition requiring a priori anticoagulation were excluded.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be instructed to eat at least two daily servings of meat, poultry, fish (e.g. 2 g/kg) or other protein-rich food, starting at least one week before embryo transfer and continuing until delivery. They will be also recommended to avoid high-glycemic index meals (high-carbohydrate, low-fiber), such as snacks, candies, fiber-free juices, coconut water, and sugar-sweetened beverages, particularly carbonated soft drinks and sport drinks.&#xD;
Patients suffering from nausea usually do not tolerate solid food. As a result, fiber-free juices and sugar-sweetened beverages account of most of their caloric intake, which may cause non-adherence to the protocol. Women with nausea or vomiting will be treated with ondansetron.</description>
