      The gut microbiome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The human body is colonized by a multitude of microorganisms whose collective genome, the&#xD;
      microbiome, complements and enhances our own genome. From this perspective, humans are&#xD;
      &quot;supra-organisms&quot; colonized by a number of microbial cells that is 10 times greater than the&#xD;
      sum of all our human somatic and germ cells, and carrying 150 times more genetic information.&#xD;
      The intestine contains the largest collection of microbes among all of our body's &quot;habitats&quot;.&#xD;
      In the colon, for example, bacteria reach densities of 1011 cells per gram of luminal&#xD;
      contents. Together, gut microbes form a community, or microbiota, that has a major impact on&#xD;
      health through interactions with host cells (including components of the innate and adaptive&#xD;
      immune systems), through extraction of nutrients and energy from the diet, and through&#xD;
      complex biotransformations of a variety of ingested compounds, including potential&#xD;
      carcinogens. One of the main measures tested when analyzing bacterial populations is&#xD;
      diversity - identifying the different microbial components in the population, and describing&#xD;
      how similar they are to one another (according to phylogeny) both within a sample and between&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in the gut microbiome: The majority of gut microbes are generally viewed as&#xD;
      beneficial symbionts, but recent work has revealed that the wrong combination of beneficial&#xD;
      microbes can be harmful. Shifts in the composition of the microbiome occur at different&#xD;
      stages in life, such as childhood, aging, and pregnancy. Changes in the composition&#xD;
      (dysbiosis) are also associated with a growing list of diseases, such as obesity,&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), diabetes, metabolic syndrome and others. Such associations&#xD;
      raise the question of whether the dysbiosis contributes to, or is, a symptom of the disease.&#xD;
      Microbiome transplant experiments have demonstrated a role of the microbiome in several&#xD;
      diseases: several phenotypes could be transferred via the microbiota, such as enhanced fat&#xD;
      gain, metabolic syndrome, colitis and recently, fecal transplantation from lean human&#xD;
      subjects to human subjects with metabolic syndrome was shown to increase insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
      Fecal transplantations have also been used successfully to treat IBD patients. Together these&#xD;
      transplantation-based studies imply that the specific composition of the microbiota can be an&#xD;
      important factor in the onset, and possibly the progression of chronic diseases. Thus, the&#xD;
      gut microbiota may be considered, by extension, a factor in host fitness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diet and the microbiome: One of the factors that most influences the composition of the&#xD;
      microbiome is diet. Changes in diet influence the relative abundance and composition of the&#xD;
      microbiota almost immediately, but for these compositional changes to become stable, the&#xD;
      dietary change has to be long term. A few examples of recent studies on how the diet impacts&#xD;
      the microbiota are mentioned below. In humans, an increase in the ratio of&#xD;
      Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes is observed when restricting the calorie/carbohydrate content.&#xD;
      Reduced dietary intake of carbohydrates has also been shown to result in decreased&#xD;
      concentrations of butyrate producing bacteria. The type and quantity of dietary fat and&#xD;
      carbohydrate have also been shown to alter the gut microbiome of people with metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome. Other bacteria, Prevotella for example, are associated with high intake of&#xD;
      carbohydrates and simple sugars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A diet high in fiber has been shown to be associated with an increase in Bifidobacterium,&#xD;
      Lactobacillus, Enterococcus and Ruminococcus. Ruminococcus was also shown to increase in&#xD;
      abundance in subjects on a resistant starch diet. Changes due to diet have also been&#xD;
      described in mice. For example, a high fat diet can profoundly alter the composition of the&#xD;
      microbiota towards an enrichment of Firmicutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The female microbiome: Women go through several major physiological transitions during their&#xD;
      lifetime, beginning with puberty, followed by conception, pregnancy and finally menopause.&#xD;
      During these changes the female body undergoes hormonal, metabolic, immunological changes,&#xD;
      and changes in the microbiome.In a pioneering study the investigators recently showed that&#xD;
      gut microbiota is profoundly altered in pregnancy (and changes dramatically during gestation)&#xD;
      as compared to that in non-pregnant women. Together with what the investigators know about&#xD;
      changes in the female vaginal microbiome (reduced microbial richness and diversity in&#xD;
      pregnancy along with an enrichment of Lactobacilli) and other microbial changes that are&#xD;
      unique to women (such as dramatic shifts in hormonal levels) - ] the investigators expect&#xD;
      that different pathologies will be correlated with alterations in the microbiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the proposed research, the investigators aim to test whether there is a correlation&#xD;
      between gestational diabetes melitus and changes in the microbiome, as well as when the&#xD;
      changes started and how glucose balance with diet changes will alter the microbiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To find out the differences in the microbiome composition between trimesters in healthy&#xD;
           pregnant women&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To find out the differences in the microbiome composition between GDM and healthy&#xD;
           pregnant women during all trimesters&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To find out the differences in the microbiome composition between balanced sugar GDM&#xD;
           with diet and healthy women (without GDM) from GDM diagnosis till third trimester&#xD;
