  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 study whose main purpose is to evaluate gene changes and immune biomarkers&#xD;
      in patients with solid tumors during treatment with pembrolizumab and in relation to response&#xD;
      to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that is designed to block a protein called programmed&#xD;
      cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) which will allow the body's immune system to kill the cancer&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will involve treatment with pembrolizumab, tests and procedures done for safety,&#xD;
      and the collection of archival tumor tissue, fresh tumor biopsies, and blood samples for&#xD;
      biomarker research (including genetic testing).&#xD;
