    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Written informed consent and any locally required authorization (eg, HIPAA) obtained&#xD;
             from the patient/legal representative prior to performing any protocol-related&#xD;
             procedures, including screening evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Metastatic or unresectable cancer that expresses KIT as documented in the patient's&#xD;
             pathology report.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. For patients with GIST, patients will have progressed on at least one prior tyrosine&#xD;
             kinase inhibitor therapy or be intolerant. If documented to have SDH deficient or&#xD;
             PDGFRA-D842V GIST, no prior therapy is required for study entry. Other patients with&#xD;
             KIT positive cancers will have progressed on at least one prior therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have at least 1 lesion that is measurable using RECIST guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Females of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a nonsterilized male&#xD;
             partner must use 2 methods of effective contraception from screening, and must agree&#xD;
             to continue using such precautions for 60 days after the final dose of study&#xD;
             medication. Females of childbearing potential are defined as those who are not&#xD;
             surgically sterile (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or&#xD;
             complete hysterectomy) or those who are postmenopausal (defined as 12 months with no&#xD;
             menses without an alternative medical cause).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Nonsterilized males who are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing&#xD;
             potential must, with their partner, use 2 acceptable methods of effective&#xD;
             contraception from Day 1 through 60 days after receipt of the final dose of study&#xD;
             medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. ECOG status of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Adequate organ function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL. This criterion must be met without transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 5 × upper&#xD;
                  limit of normal (ULN) for cases involving liver metastasis and ≤ 2.5 ×ULN for all&#xD;
                  other cases&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN except for cases of documented or suspected Gilbert's&#xD;
                  disease, in which bilirubin must be ≤ 5 × ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Receipt of anticancer therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Within 3 weeks prior to the first dose of CDX-0158 of any biologic treatment or&#xD;
                  IV chemotherapy.&#xD;

               -  Within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of CDX-0158 of any oral therapy or 5.5&#xD;
                  half lives whichever is longer or following palliative radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Concurrent use of hormones for non-cancer related conditions (e.g., insulin for&#xD;
             diabetes and hormone replacement therapy) is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Requirement for chronic immunosuppressive medication including systemic&#xD;
             corticosteroids above the physiologic dose (30 mg/day hydrocortisone or the&#xD;
             equivalent).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Known allergy or past administration reaction including infusion related reaction&#xD;
             (IRRs), anaphylactic, or anaphylactoid reactions to any component of the CDX-0158&#xD;
             formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of clinically significant allergic reactions or atopic disease that may pose&#xD;
             an increased risk of severe CDX-0158 IRRs.&#xD;
&#xD;

             cancer, cervical carcinoma in situ, non-melanoma skin cancer, or ductal carcinoma in&#xD;
             situ of the breast that has/have been surgically cured would not be exclusionary).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Unresolved toxicities from prior anticancer therapy, defined as having not resolved to&#xD;
             NCI CTCAE v 4.03 &lt; Grade 2 or normalized to baseline, or to levels dictated in the&#xD;
             inclusion/exclusion criteria, with the exception of alopecia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Major surgical procedure (as defined by the investigator) within 30 days prior to&#xD;
             Study Day 1 or incomplete recovery from any prior surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness that would limit compliance with study requirements&#xD;
             or compromise the patient such as ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive&#xD;
             heart failure, hypertension requiring adjustment of medication, idiopathic and&#xD;
             symptomatic hypotension, unstable angina pectoris, clinically significant cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia including uncontrolled atrial fibrillation, active peptic ulcer disease or&#xD;
             gastritis with ongoing blood loss, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would&#xD;
             limit compliance or compromise the ability of the patient to give written informed&#xD;
             consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with&#xD;
             evaluation of the study medication or interpretation of patient safety or study&#xD;
             results.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Concurrent enrollment in another clinical study, unless it is an observational&#xD;
             (non-interventional) study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients with a left ventricular cardiac ejection fraction &lt; 50% as assessed by an&#xD;
             echocardiogram or MUGA scan or prolonged QTc interval of Grade 2 or higher or history&#xD;
             of prolonged QTc interval from other drugs.&#xD;
