    <textblock>
      This was a randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial investigating the short term&#xD;
      clinical efficacy of a dentifrice containing Eugenia uniflora L. ripe fruit extract in&#xD;
      preventing gingivitis in children. The study consisted of a sample of 50 male and female&#xD;
      subjects between the ages of 10 and 12 years old, who had clinical signs of gingivitis. The&#xD;
      subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups. The intervention group comprised 25&#xD;
      subjects who used the dentifrice with E. uniflora L. ripe fruit hydroalcoholic extract, three&#xD;
      times per day, for seven consecutive days. The control group comprised 25 subjects who used&#xD;
      the control dentifrice (fluoride, 1500 ppm and triclosan, 0.3%) for seven consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was estimated using Fleming's single-stage procedure for phase II trials.&#xD;
      With regard to the primary outcome, a response proportion of at least 50% was defined as&#xD;
      being clinically significant. The type I error was set as 0.05, and the type II error was set&#xD;
      at 0.1. Based on these values, a sample size of 20 individuals per trial arm would provide&#xD;
      90% power (1-β) to detect any clinically relevant treatment difference of 50% or greater&#xD;
      compared to baseline. Taking into consideration an attrition rate of approximately 20%, the&#xD;
      final sample size per trial arm comprised 25 individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical examinations were performed at baseline and after seven days of dentifrice use. The&#xD;
      examination was performed by a single examiner who was adequately calibrated with a Kappa&#xD;
      statistic of 0.8, which is considered to be satisfactory agreement according to Landis &amp;&#xD;
      Koch. The examination data were recorded in a specific clinical chart. The diagnosis of&#xD;
      gingivitis (primary outcome) was assessed using the Gingival Bleeding Index (GBI) proposed by&#xD;
      Ainamo and Bay. The accumulation of biofilm (secondary outcome) was assessed with the&#xD;
      Simplified Oral Hygiene Index (OHI-S) described by Greene and Vermilion. Prior to the study,&#xD;
      all of the subjects were instructed on correct tooth brushing techniques and received a kit&#xD;
      that contained a toothbrush and one of the dentifrices (without the identification of its&#xD;
      contents). The dentifrices were also masked with regard to flavor and color so that they&#xD;
      could not be identified. In addition, the examiner had no knowledge of the subject&#xD;
      allocation. Thus, the study was double-blind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample included only subjects who had not used an antimicrobial in the last two months,&#xD;
      including topical fluoride.&#xD;
