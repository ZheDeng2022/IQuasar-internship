      When patient presents a lung node, there is an important risk that this node was a tumor. For&#xD;
      patients who have these nodes, the surgery is the best treatment. When the surgery is&#xD;
      possible, the thoracoscopy may be more advantageous compared to thoracothomy (decrease of&#xD;
      post surgery pains, decrease of recovery time and decrease of drugs consumption).&#xD;
      Nevertheless, thoracoscopy needs specific materiels and nécessite un équipement spécifique&#xD;
      and trained physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, this technic needs that nodes was well localized. For this, radiologists use&#xD;
      CT-guided hook wire localization of these lung nodes before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TThe hook wire laying is delicate. It can lead secondaries effects as pneumothorax,&#xD;
      dislodgement of the hook wire before and after surgery. The success rate of hook wire&#xD;
      fixation in lung near of the node is primary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of our study is to assess the success rate localization of node in surgery&#xD;
      piece, that is to verify if the hook wire have allowed to localize the lung node in surgery&#xD;
      piece.&#xD;

      For lung cancer patients, the best treatment remains the surgery when tumor is localized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When patient presents a lung node, there is an important risk that this node was a tumor. For&#xD;
      patients who have these nodes, the surgery is the best treatment. When the surgery is&#xD;
      possible, the thoracoscopy may be more advantageous compared to thoracothomy (decrease of&#xD;
      post surgery pains, decrease of recovery time and decrease of drugs consumption).&#xD;
      Nevertheless, thoracoscopy needs specific materiels and nécessite un équipement spécifique&#xD;
      and trained physicians. In France, only 1% of surgeries qu'en France, thoracoscopy represents&#xD;
      less than 1% of lung cancer surgeries while it represents 30% of interventions in Japan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, this technic needs that nodes was well localized. For this, radiologists use&#xD;
      CT-guided hook wire localization of these lung nodes before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the litterature, this localization technic is efficient (Chen et al, 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hook wire laying is delicate. It can lead secondaries effects as pneumothorax,&#xD;
      dislodgement of the hook wire before and after surgery. The success rate of hook wire&#xD;
      fixation in lung near of the node is primary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of our study is to assess the success rate localization of node in surgery&#xD;
      piece, that is to verify if the hook wire have allowed to localize the lung node in surgery&#xD;
      piece. This implies that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the hook wire was well CT-guided in the lung&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the hook wire did not present a dislodgment before or during surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the hook wire is near of the node to be removed Among secondaries objectives, the&#xD;
           investigators will assess the safety and possible complications which could occur. The&#xD;
           investigators will also measure the distance between hook wire and center of the node&#xD;

    <description>There is only one arm. When patient undergo surgery , the radiologist will place a CT-guided Hook wire in order to localize it in patient lung. The intervention consists to place a CT-guided hook wire in contact with the pulmonary nodule under local anesthesia.&#xD;
Then, the thoracoscopy will be realised. Then, the surgery piece will be examined to confirm if the node is in the surgery piece</description>
