  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-endodontic pain (PP) still is major problem for endodontic patients, analgesics are&#xD;
      routinely prescribed. Incidence of PP is reported extensively, and reviewed. PP is a&#xD;
      complicated multi factorial process and is affected by factors related to patients, to the&#xD;
      tooth and to the skills and experience of the dentist and because of that, if the&#xD;
      interrelation of these factors is not considered in a PP, study data might be confusing. Any&#xD;
      study trying to evaluate the effect of a specific technique or new device in the incidence or&#xD;
      characteristics of PP should control all the confounding factors that have been described to&#xD;
      be involved in the tested outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      reports mention a variable prevalence of PP, ranging from 82.9 to 10.6%. These variations are&#xD;
      because of the differences in study methods, and treatment procedures after root canal&#xD;
      treatment, selection of patients or experience and skills of the dentists, vary when&#xD;
      different studies are compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies had confirmed that chemomechanical debridement of the root canal results in&#xD;
      extrusion of dentinal chips, pulp tissue fragments, necrotic tissues, microorganisms, and&#xD;
      root canal irrigants through the apical foramen. All preparation techniques and instruments,&#xD;
      regardless of maintaining shorter working length of the apical terminus have reported to be&#xD;
      related with extrusion of infected debris, and some of them extruded less material and others&#xD;
      extruded more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periapical inflammation and postoperative flare-ups may result from apical extrusion of&#xD;
      debris that is also referred to as the &quot;worm&quot; of necrotic debris A common outcome of the&#xD;
      studies examining the amount of apically extruded debris was that the techniques involving a&#xD;
      push-pull filing motion usually produce a greater mass of apical debris than those have&#xD;
      rotational action Files which has reciprocating and in-and-out filing motion, may act as a&#xD;
      piston, extruding more debris and irrigants. While the file with continuous rotation motion&#xD;
      like a screw conveyor improving transportation of dentinal chips and debris coronally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, investigators compare post-endodontic pain between these two systems. Mtwo (&#xD;
      continuous rotation system) with safe-sider (reciprocating system). Therefore, the aim of&#xD;
      this study is Evaluation of post-endodontic pain after root canal treatment with two rotary&#xD;
      systems: Mtwo &amp; safe-sider&#xD;
