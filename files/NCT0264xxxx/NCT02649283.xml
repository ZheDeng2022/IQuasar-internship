    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IV, multicenter, open label, non-randomized comparative group study to assess&#xD;
      the safety and performance of the OrbiSymm system in subjects referred to contra lateral&#xD;
      breast symmetrization involving a breast reduction following breast reconstruction&#xD;
      post-mastectomy.&#xD;

      The device has the CE Mark and will be used in the indication for which it is approved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 60 patients will be assigned to the study (up to 30 patients for Orbix procedure, and&#xD;
      up to 30 patients without Orbix procedure (only routine reduction/symmetrisation). Patients&#xD;
      will return to the clinic for follow-up at 1, 3, 6, 12 &amp; 24 months (last visit will be&#xD;
      optional).&#xD;
