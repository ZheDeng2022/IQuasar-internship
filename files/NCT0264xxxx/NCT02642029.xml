    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate the&#xD;
      impact of modulating cerebellar activity on time perception, executive function, and mood and&#xD;
      psychotic symptoms in psychosis patients (i.e., schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and&#xD;
      bipolar disorder with psychotic features). The investigators hypothesize that abnormally&#xD;
      reduced activity in the cerebellum contributes to the abnormalities in patients, that&#xD;
      cerebellum-mediated disruptions in time perception may partially underlie executive&#xD;
      dysfunction and symptoms, and that cerebellar stimulation will normalize disease-relevant&#xD;
      outcome measures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The cerebellum plays a major role in integrative processing of higher order cognitive and&#xD;
      affective functions, but it has not been considered a major treatment target for psychotic&#xD;
      disorders. The goal of this study is to administer three different conditions of transcranial&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation (TMS)-- excitatory, inhibitory, and sham TMS-- in a cross-over design in&#xD;
      psychosis patients (i.e., schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder with&#xD;
      psychotic features) to investigate with causal explanatory power the role of the cerebellum&#xD;
      as a treatment target for psychotic disorders. More specifically, the investigators will&#xD;
      measure the effects of cerebellar excitation and inhibition on time perception, executive&#xD;
      function, and symptomatology. TMS will be administered using a theta-burst stimulation (TBS)&#xD;
      protocol applied to the posterior cerebellar vermis. Participants will undergo three study&#xD;
      sessions, one for each of the three TMS conditions. During each session, the investigators&#xD;
      will administer validated cognitive paradigms and clinical measures immediately before and&#xD;
      after TMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1: Investigate the role of the cerebellum in abnormalities of time perception, executive&#xD;
      function, and mood and psychotic symptoms by evaluating these functions before and&#xD;
      immediately after excitatory, inhibitory, or sham TMS applied to the cerebellar vermis in&#xD;
      patients with psychosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1a) Time perception hypothesis: Patients with psychotic disorders will have impaired timing&#xD;
      perception, i.e., higher number of errors and/or greater inter-trial variability in an&#xD;
      interval discrimination task both at baseline and after sham TMS. The investigators predict&#xD;
      that the abnormalities in patients will improve after excitatory but not inhibitory TMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1b) Executive function hypothesis: Patients will show a higher number of errors and longer&#xD;
      reaction times on the N-back working memory task, both at baseline and after sham TMS. The&#xD;
      investigators predict that these deficits in patients will improve after excitatory but not&#xD;
      inhibitory TMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1c) Symptom hypothesis: Symptom ratings using visual analog scales will improve in the&#xD;
      period immediately after excitatory but not inhibitory TMS, and show no significant change&#xD;
      after sham TMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2: Investigate the relationship between time perception and (a) executive function and (b)&#xD;
      symptomatology in patients with psychotic disorders. Hypothesis: The investigators predict&#xD;
      that performance on the time perception task will correlate with performance on a working&#xD;
      memory task as well as with mood and psychotic symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study may improve understanding about the role of the cerebellum in the pathophysiology&#xD;
      of psychotic disorders. Such knowledge can potentially guide the development of cerebellar&#xD;
      TMS as a therapeutic intervention for psychosis.&#xD;

    <time_frame>In each of the 3 study visits, participants will undergo (a) pre-TMS assessments (15-20min), (b) TMS (15min), and (c) post-TMS assessments (15-20min). Thus, approximately 30-45 min will separate the pre- and post-TMS task performances.</time_frame>
    <description>In each trial, participants are presented with two tones separated by 1200 ms (the standard interval), a 1s delay, then a comparison pair of tones. The time interval of the second tone pair will be either equal to (E-condition), longer than (L-condition), or shorter than (S-condition) that of the first pair. Participants are asked to indicate using a keyboard whether the second time interval is equal, longer, or shorter than the first.</description>

    <time_frame>In each of the 3 study visits, participants will undergo (a) pre-TMS assessments (15-20min), (b) TMS (15min), and (c) post-TMS assessments (15-20min). Thus, approximately 30-45 min will separate the pre- and post-TMS symptom ratings.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will take a brief computerized survey pre- and post-TMS, in which they will be presented with visual analogue scales (VAS) and asked to indicate current levels of depression, anxiety, euphoria, auditory hallucinations, visual hallucinations, paranoia, referential thinking, and delusions of control. The VAS format will allow participants to self-report ratings quickly and easily with simple mouse clicks.</description>
