    <textblock>
      Patients presenting with Left Ventricle (LV) dysfunction undergoing cardiac surgery are at&#xD;
      increased risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality. LV dysfunction has been reported as&#xD;
      an independent predictor of operative mortality in patients undergoing Cardiac surgery. It&#xD;
      also often leads to low cardiac output states with many of these patients requiring inotropic&#xD;
      or mechanical support and vasopressors for hours to days after surgery. Speckle tracking when&#xD;
      combined with three dimensional (3D) imaging techniques might prove to be a more sensitive&#xD;
      marker for ventricular dysfunction. The present study investigates early outcomes in a&#xD;
      consecutive series of patients with LV dysfunction undergoing cardiac surgery&#xD;

    <textblock>
      All patients inside operating room, a wide bore i/v access and radial artery will be&#xD;
      cannulated under local anesthesia. Standard opioid- propofol- relaxant based induction will&#xD;
      be followed. After endotracheal intubation, an adult 2D Trans Eesophageal Echocardiography&#xD;
      (TEE) probe (6VT-D probe of the GE vivid E9 echocardiography system (GE Medical Systems,&#xD;
      Hortein, Norway) will be inserted. A 7 Fr triple lumen catheter and 8.5 Fr introducer sheath&#xD;
      will be placed in the right internal jugular vein under ultrasound guidance. A 7 Fr Pulmonary&#xD;
      Artery Catheter (PAC) (Swan Ganz catheter, Edwards Life Sciences) will be floated as per&#xD;
      standard practice. Attempts to wedge will be discontinued if the catheter does not wedge&#xD;
      beyond 8 cm into the main pulmonary artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery will be performed through a midline sternotomy on cardiopulmonary bypass with bicaval&#xD;
      cannulation and with intermittent antegrade warm blood cardioplegia. All surgical procedures&#xD;
      were performed by experienced surgeons using standardized techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and anaesthesia management will be performed according to our&#xD;
      standard operating procedures. Moderate hypothermic (28-32*C) CPB will be established with a&#xD;
      non-pulsatile flow of 2,5 l/min/m2 and an arterial pressure &gt; 60 mmHg without additional&#xD;
      filtration. CPB will be primed with balanced electrolyte solution. Coagulation will be offset&#xD;
      by 400 IU/kg heparin aiming at an Activated Clotting Time (ACT) &gt; 480 seconds. Additionally,&#xD;
      all patients will receive tranexamic acid 100mg/kg. Cardioplegic arrest will be induced and&#xD;
      maintained by intermittent administration of ante grade potassium enriched solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perioperative goal-oriented haemodynamic support (i.e. heart rate 80-100 beats/min, mean&#xD;
      arterial pressure 65-85 mmHg, central venous pressure (CVP) 8-12 mmHg at positive&#xD;
      end-expiratory pressure 5 cms of water, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure 12-15 mmHg,&#xD;
      cardiac index &gt;2.5 l /min/m2 2, stroke volume index &gt;30 ml/m, mixed venous oxygen saturation&#xD;
      &gt;65) will be established according to institutional standards. Intraoperatively, patients&#xD;
      will be monitored with transoesophageal echocardiography (6VT-D probe of the GE vivid E9&#xD;
      echocardiography system (GE Medical Systems, Hortein, Norway)) and a pulmonary artery&#xD;
      catheter with or without continuous mixed venous oximetry measurement. In case of difficult&#xD;
      CPB separation despite hemodynamic optimization, an intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) will be&#xD;
      placed according to the team's assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After chest closure, the patient will be transferred intubated and mechanically ventilated in&#xD;
      the ICU. Patients will be kept sedated with morphine administration (20-40 mcg/kg/min) until&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary stability is achieved, chest tube drainage is negligible (&lt;100 ml/h), and the&#xD;
      patient is judged to be extubated. If mechanical ventilation is required &gt; 12 hours, sedation&#xD;
      will be switched to midazolam (10-20 mcg/kg/min) combined with morphine (20-40 mcg/kg/min),&#xD;
      and weaning from mechanical ventilation will be performed according to the standard operating&#xD;
      procedures at our hospital. Hemodynamic optimization will be continuously accomplished&#xD;
      according to the haemodynamic goals as mentioned above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decision for renal replacement therapy (RRT) will be taken in consultation with the&#xD;
      department of nephrology and based on the following criteria: a) oliguria &lt; 500 ml/dl and/or&#xD;
      anuria &lt; 100 ml/dl, b) metabolic acidosis, c) hyperkaliaemia, and d) uraemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamic monitoring Once PAC is placed, baseline parameters will be recorded in mmHg.&#xD;
      Pressure will be defined as Pulmonary systolic pressure peak (PAPs), mean pressure (PAPm),&#xD;
      and Pulmonary Artery Wedge Pressure (PAWP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These reading will be taken as baseline after placement of PAC. In addition usual vital&#xD;
      parameters such as mean blood pressure (MAP), CVP and heart rate (HR), will also be acquired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic Vascular Resistance (SVR) and Cardiac Index (CI) calculation will be done as per the&#xD;
      standard protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time periods at which parameters will be evaluated After induction of anesthesia hemodynamic&#xD;
      and echocardiographic parameters will be taken. After induction, if the patients require&#xD;
      ionotropes and/or vasopressors it will be administered to achieve the haemodynamic goal as&#xD;
      mentioned above. The parameters will be obtained again after coming out of CPB. Patient will&#xD;
      be started on vasopressors- inotropic support as deemed fit by the treating anaesthesiologist&#xD;
      to achieve the haemodynamic goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End point of study: Either patient dies or discharged from the ICU as per the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiographic monitoring All patients in whom TEE probe is placed will undergo an initial&#xD;
      comprehensive TEE examination covering all the 28 standard views as per the American Society&#xD;
      of Echocardiography (ASE) guidelines. In addition, focused assessment for the study&#xD;
      parameters will be done after the completion of comprehensive examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of LV Comprehensive echocardiography will be performed before surgery using 6VT-D&#xD;
      probe of the GE vivid E9 echocardiography system (GE Medical Systems, Hortein, Norway),&#xD;
      including standard 2D views digitally stored at a high frame rate (&gt;50 frames/s). All&#xD;
      measurements will be performed on line on the same machine by anaesthesiologist experienced&#xD;
      in TEE blinded to patient's outcome. Left ventricle (LV) volumes in systole and diastole and&#xD;
      LV Ejection Fraction (LVEF) will be computed using the Simpson biplane method from 2 chamber&#xD;
      (2C) and 4 chamber (4C) apical views. The endocardial borders will be traced for the&#xD;
      measurements and the papillary muscles will be excluded, as recommended in the guidelines. A&#xD;
      frame rate of &gt;50 will be ensured during the measurements to ensure accurate endocardial&#xD;
      border detection. Foreshortening will be avoided by retroflexing the probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Speckle-tracking analysis will be performed to assess LV Global Longitudinal strain (GLS).&#xD;
      GLS will be computed using 2D-speckle-tracking analysis by automated function imaging (AFI)&#xD;
      measured from the three mid esophageal views (long-axis and two- and four-chamber views). For&#xD;
      strain processing, the peak of the R-wave on the electrocardiogram will be used as the&#xD;
      reference time point for end-diastole and segments with poor-quality tracking will be&#xD;
      manually discarded. GLS will only be computed from patients with &gt;14 segments adequately&#xD;
      tracked for a 18-segment model. GLS will be calculated by averaging the peak strain values of&#xD;
      18 segments. Three-dimensional LV volumes and EF will be measured from the 3D full-volume&#xD;
      data set. Using the on board GE software (GE vivid E9 echocardiography system (GE Medical&#xD;
      Systems, Hortein, Norway), the full-volume data of the LV will be organized into orthogonal&#xD;
      four-, two-chamber, and short-axis views. Enddiastolic and end-systolic frames will be&#xD;
      selected. Mitral annular and apical points will be placed on these images by adjusting the&#xD;
      axis. Semi-automated LV endocardial border detection software on the system will outline the&#xD;
      endocardial borders in these three planes. The software then uses sequence analysis to track&#xD;
      the endocardium in all frames and then automatically calculate a true 3D end diastolic volume&#xD;
      (EDV), end systolic volume (ESV), and EF from the moving 3D endocardial shell. The&#xD;
      endocardial borders could be adjusted manually if the endocardial border tracking is deemed&#xD;
      inadequate, and the sequence analysis will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diastolic function of the LV will be measured by measuring these parameters- the mitral&#xD;
      inflow velocity and the tissue Doppler velocity of the lateral mitral annulus. The mitral&#xD;
      inflow velocities (E &amp; A) will be measured by placing the cursor for pulsed wave Doppler at&#xD;
      the tip of the mitral leaflet coaptation point. The sweep speed will be set at 25mm/s and the&#xD;
      scale will be adjusted and the baseline shifted above to obtain optimal waveforms. Tissue&#xD;
      Doppler measurements will be taken by placing the cursor of pulsed wave tissue Doppler on the&#xD;
      lateral mitral annulus. A frame rate of &gt; 100m/s will be ensured by adjusting the sector&#xD;
      width and the measurements made at a sweep aped of 25mm/s.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post valve replacements, the prosthetic valves will be evaluated as per recommendations for&#xD;
      evaluation of prosthetic valves. For all measurements of pulsed and continuous wave doppler&#xD;
      the cursor will be placed at an angle &lt; 20' to the flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every attempt will be made to make measurements in sinus rhythm. In case of a non-sinus&#xD;
      rhythm, measurements will be taken at the time when the ventricular rate is close to the&#xD;
      baseline. If that is not possible, then an average of 5-6 readings will be used for analysis.&#xD;
