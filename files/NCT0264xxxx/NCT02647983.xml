  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy among men in the United States and Canada.&#xD;
      Suspicion of prostate cancer with modern screening tests, such as digital rectal exam (DRE)&#xD;
      and prostate serum antigen (PSA) require ultrasound-guided biopsy for pathological diagnosis.&#xD;
      However, this technique misses cancer in nearly one quarter of patients and finds clinically&#xD;
      insignificant disease in another third of patients, resulting in over-treatment and&#xD;
      unnecessary morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI is the best imaging method for prostate cancer detection, but current techniques cannot&#xD;
      reliably predict tumour grade and are often unreliable for localizing cancer, particularly&#xD;
      within the transition zone, where specificity is low. The primary objective of this pilot&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the added benefit of localizing prostate cancer and predicting tumour&#xD;
      grade with Hyperpolarized 13C MRI, in addition to traditional T2-weighted and&#xD;
      diffusion-weighted MR imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a pilot study, in men diagnosed with prostate cancer awaiting&#xD;
      prostatectomy, with the specific goals of comparing pre-operative imaging findings to ground&#xD;
      truth histology, using whole-mount prostate specimens. The results of this study will provide&#xD;
      insight into the prostate cancer disease signatures with MRI and determine if there is added&#xD;
      benefit for incorporation of this new technique into future clinical MRI protocols. If future&#xD;
      imaging tests could determine the size, grade and extent of disease, this would open the door&#xD;
      for less invasive, localized treatment options with reduced morbidity.&#xD;

      The metabolism of 13C (non-radioactive) enriched pyruvate can be imaged by magnetic resonance&#xD;
      (MR) spectroscopy when the nuclear spin of 13C is hyperpolarization enhanced. This technique&#xD;
      allows in-vivo separation of [1-13C]pyruvate, [1-13C]lactate, [1-13C]alanine and&#xD;
      [13C]bicarbonate signals following intravenous administration of Hyperpolarized Pyruvate&#xD;
      (13C) Injection. The total 13C-signal detected in a given tissue depends on the dose&#xD;
      administered and distribution to the tissue. The formation rate and relative levels of the&#xD;
      metabolites depend on the metabolic needs of the specific tissue. Pre-clinical data indicate&#xD;
      that some tumours show substantially higher levels and different ratios of specific&#xD;
      metabolites when compared to corresponding normal tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Soon after being taken up by cells within the prostate, [1-13C]pyruvate will be metabolized&#xD;
      into various metabolites, including [1-13C]alanine and [13C]bicarbonate (via aerobic&#xD;
      metabolism) and [1-13C]lactate (via anaerobic metabolism). It is expected that [1-13C]lactate&#xD;
      will be formed in much higher amounts in malignant tissue, where the level of glycolysis is&#xD;
      higher than in normal, BPH or inflamed tissues. Therefore, spectroscopic MR imaging of the&#xD;
      prostate after administration of Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection, is expected to&#xD;
      provide a robust, minimally invasive method to assist in detecting and characterizing&#xD;
      prostate cancer, thereby determining which patients should receive further treatment and&#xD;
      which should continue to be monitored via routine PSA and DRE testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot prospective, single-institution study in men with biopsy-proven carcinoma of&#xD;
      the prostate. Patient screening and accrual will be completed by a treating Urologist,&#xD;
      Radiologist, or study nurse/coordinator. Clinical procedures will be completed at Sunnybrook&#xD;
      Health Sciences Centre (SHSC). Eligible subjects will be undergoing radical prostatectomy at&#xD;
      SHSC for biopsy-proven T1C disease (cancer found by elevated PSA and needle biopsy only) and&#xD;
      serum PSA &lt; 10. For the purpose of analysis, subjects will be divided into three groups based&#xD;
      on the grade of cancer found on needle biopsy. A typical subject will be 50-80 years old. The&#xD;
      length of this study for participants is approximately 1 hour of scan time.&#xD;
