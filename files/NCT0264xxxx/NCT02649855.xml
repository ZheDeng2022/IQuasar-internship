      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metastatic castrate-sensitive prostate cancer is cancer that has spread beyond the prostate&#xD;
      area. It can be controlled by lowering the amount of testosterone in the body. This is called&#xD;
      androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The vaccine PROSTVAC might help the immune system kill&#xD;
      cancer cells. Researchers want to add PROSTVAC and docetaxel chemotherapy to ADT. They think&#xD;
      this may work better against prostate cancer than ADT alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test if adding PROSTVAC and docetaxel to ADT works better against prostate cancer than ADT&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men ages 18 years and over with metastatic castrate-sensitive prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible CT, MRI, or bone scan: Participants lie in a machine. The machine takes pictures of&#xD;
      the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrocardiogram: Soft electrodes are stuck to the skin to record heart signals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 2 optional tumor biopsies during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will join 1 of 2 groups. Both groups will get:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Docetaxel by vein&#xD;
&#xD;
      Steroids by mouth or vein before each docetaxel infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROSTVAC injection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups first have ADT. One to 4 months after, they have:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Docetaxel every 3 weeks for 6 cycles&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROSTVAC 3 weeks after the last infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Booster injections 2 weeks later and then every 3 weeks, for 6 boosters total&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROSTVAC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Booster 2 weeks later&#xD;
&#xD;
      Docetaxel hours later&#xD;
&#xD;
      Docetaxel and the booster every 3 weeks for 6 cycles&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a visit 4-5 weeks after the last treatment. They will then have visits&#xD;
      every 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed for up to 15 years. This includes physical exams every year for&#xD;
      5 years.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A phase III trial demonstrated that combining docetaxel and androgen deprivation therapy&#xD;
           (ADT) significantly improved survival (57.6 vs 44.0 months (HR=0.56, (0.44-0.70), p&#xD;
           &lt;0.0001) for men with metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PROSTVAC (developed by the National Cancer Institute [NCI] and licensed to Bavarian&#xD;
           Nordic Immunotherapeutics, Mountain View, CA) is a therapeutic cancer vaccine for&#xD;
           prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preclinical and clinical studies support the potential synergy in the combination of&#xD;
           docetaxel and PROSTVAC. The potential to combine docetaxel with vaccine in mCSPC could&#xD;
           improve upon the survival advantage that has been previously seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine if PROSTVAC combined with docetaxel is able to induce greater antigen spreading&#xD;
      (i.e. a broader immune response) with greater associated response score compared to docetaxel&#xD;
      alone after 19 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key Eligibility Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Must have castrate sensitive prostate cancer (rising PSA and testosterone over 100) or&#xD;
           is within 134 days of starting ADT (Arm A or B) or within 28 days of start ADT (Arm C)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histopathological confirmation of prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have metastatic disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have a performance status of 0 to 2 according to the ECOG criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a randomized trial of ADT followed by simultaneous docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) q3 weeks&#xD;
           x 6 cycles + PROSTVAC q3 weeks x 6 cycles versus ADT followed by sequential docetaxel 75&#xD;
           mg/m(2) q3 weeks x 6 cycles followed by PROSTVAC q3 weeks x 6 cycles in men with newly&#xD;
           diagnosed mCSPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who have not started ADT or who have been on ADT 28 days or fewer will be&#xD;
           assigned to treatment with PROSTVAC for 4 - 6 injections followed by docetaxel 75 mg/m2&#xD;
           q3 weeks x 6 cycles.&#xD;
