  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We anticipate that drug-naïve ADHD probands, particularly those with DAT1 or SLC6A2 gene&#xD;
      variants may have higher level of altered microstructural integrity of frontostriatal (FS),&#xD;
      frontoparietal (FP), other hypothesized fiber tracts and decreased brain activity of FS, FP,&#xD;
      and other circuits, deficits in ERP, and impaired EF, SA, IIA and VM than probands without&#xD;
      DAT1 or SLC6A2 gene variants or adult neurotypical. The alterations in the structural and&#xD;
      functional connectivity, neurophysiological and neuropsychological functioning would be&#xD;
      observed in the unaffected siblings as compared to neurotypical. The unaffected siblings will&#xD;
      be in the intermediate position between drug-naïve adult ADHD probands and neurotypical. The&#xD;
      genetic dosage is anticipated to pose the strongest effects on the cortical thickness, brain&#xD;
      volume, gyrification and microstructural property of white matter, followed by&#xD;
      neurophysiology, functional connectivity, and neuropsychological function with the least&#xD;
      effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of longitudinal follow-up part, we also anticipated despite increasing thinning of&#xD;
      cortical thickness, microstructural integrity of several targets fiber tracts, and brain&#xD;
      activity of target brain regions and improving performance in EF, SA, IIV, VM from childhood&#xD;
      to late adolescence and young adulthood in the neurotypical group, the slopes of&#xD;
      developmental trajectories of these neuroimaging and neuropsychological function are lower in&#xD;
      the ADHD group.&#xD;

      Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common (3-10%), early-onset, clinically&#xD;
      and genetically heterogeneous neuropsychiatric disorder with lifelong neuropsychological&#xD;
      deficits. Despite extensive research in adult ADHD in western countries, there has been no&#xD;
      published data about adult ADHD in Taiwan except the PI's and colleagues' previous works on&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy in adults with ADHD and only few endophenotype studies based on adults with&#xD;
      ADHD in the world. The ultimate goals of this 5-year project are to identify which&#xD;
      neuropsychological, functional and structural connectivity, and neurophysiological variables&#xD;
      can be effective endophenotypes (biomarkers) for ADHD based on unaffected sibling (1st-3rd&#xD;
      years) and follow-up (4th-5th years) designs. With the accomplishment of the following study&#xD;
      goals, this study will be the first study on the topics of neuroimaging and&#xD;
      neurophysiological endophenotypes on adult ADHD using advanced imaging techniques (i.e.,&#xD;
      Tract-based autonomic analysis, TBAA) and comprehensive clinical and neurocognitive data.&#xD;
      This proposal has one primary aim and four secondary aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To validate structural (assessed by TBAA using diffusing spectrum imaging, DSI) and&#xD;
           functional connectivity (assessed by resting-state fMRI) in frontostriatal,&#xD;
           frontoparietal and other circuitries, and neurophysiological functions (assessed by&#xD;
           stop-signal event-related potential [ERP]: N2, P3, ERN, Pe) as effective imaging&#xD;
           endophenotypes by demonstrating the intermediate position of unaffected siblings between&#xD;
           ADHD probands, and age-, sex-, handedness-, and IQ-matched adult neurotypical and&#xD;
           association with DAT1 and NET (SLC6A2) variants;&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To validate the executive functions (EF), sustained attention (SA), intraindividual&#xD;
           variability (IIV), visual-spatial memory (VM) as effective neurocognitive endophenotypes&#xD;
           by demonstrating the intermediate position of unaffected siblings between ADHD probands,&#xD;
           and adult neurotypical;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To examine the developmental trajectory and stability of neuropsychological functions&#xD;
           and structural and functional connectivity from childhood to adolescence and young&#xD;
           adulthood;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To correlate the data from structural (morphometric, cortical thickness, gyrification,&#xD;
           fiber tract integrity) and functional connectivity (rsfMRI), neuropsychology (Executive&#xD;
           function, visual-spatial memory, sustained attention, variability), neurophysiology&#xD;
           (Stop-signal ERP) and ADHD core symptoms stratifying by the presence of ADHD, presence&#xD;
           of DAT1 and NET (SLC6A2) variants, proband-unaffected sibling dyads, and different&#xD;
           developmental stages.&#xD;

        This 5-year proposal consists of two parts: (1) a 3-year case-control study with unaffected&#xD;
        siblings and adult neurotypicals as controls to investigate the brain structural&#xD;
        connectivity, functional connectivity, neurophysiological, neuropsychological functioning&#xD;
        in 60 probands with ADHD, their unaffected siblings (at least 30 same-sex siblings,&#xD;
        n=30~60) and age-, sex-, handedness-, and IQ-matched neurotypicals (n=90~120) with&#xD;
        estimated total sample size as at least 180 up to 240. (2) a 2-year follow-up study to&#xD;
        repeat the neuropsychological and MRI assessments and to assess electrophysiology related&#xD;
        to inhibition controls of 40 adolescents and young adults with childhood diagnosis of ADHD&#xD;
        and 40 neurotypicals who had same neuropsychological and imaging assessments in&#xD;
        2010.8-1013.7.&#xD;
