  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the effect of ataluren on Maximum Reading Speed as&#xD;
      measured using the Minnesota Low Vision Reading Test (MNREAD) Acuity Charts in participants&#xD;
      with nonsense mutation aniridia. This study involves a 4-week screening period, a 144-week&#xD;
      treatment period (Stage 1: Weeks 1 to 48 [double-masked treatment] and Stage 2: Weeks 49 to&#xD;
      144 [open label treatment]), an optional 96-week open label extension sub-study, and a 4-week&#xD;
      post-treatment follow-up period (either study completion or early termination). Participants&#xD;
      that choose not to participate in the sub-study will be required to complete the&#xD;
      post-treatment follow-up visit at the end of the Stage 2 open-label extension.&#xD;

             initiation of study screening procedures and the study candidate may be required to&#xD;
             provide written assent. The rules of the responsible institutional review&#xD;
             board/independent ethics committee (IRB/IEC) regarding whether one or both parents&#xD;

             abnormality that, in the investigator's opinion, could adversely affect the safety of&#xD;
             the participant, makes it unlikely that the course of study drug administration or&#xD;
             follow-up would be completed, or could impair the assessment of study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a positive result for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human&#xD;
             immunodeficiency virus at Visit 1 (Screening).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients or excipients of the study drug&#xD;
             (polydextrose, polyethylene glycol 3350, poloxamer 407, mannitol 25C, crospovidone&#xD;
             XL10, hydroxyethyl cellulose, vanilla, colloidal silica, or magnesium stearate).&#xD;
