  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocol is being designed to offer ovarian tissue&#xD;
      cryopreservation to female pediatric patients (birth-17 years of age) with fertility&#xD;
      threatening medical diagnoses or facing surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy that may&#xD;
      cause loss of reproductive potential. Because this procedure is currently considered&#xD;
      experimental, the establishment of an IRB protocol under which this opportunity can be&#xD;
      offered is needed.&#xD;

      Ovarian tissue cryopreservation is currently considered experimental but offers the only&#xD;
      opportunity for fertility preservation in pre-menarchal girls faced with a fertility&#xD;
      threatening diagnosis or treatment plan.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria: (All inclusion criteria must be met.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Female, age birth-17 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Meet at least one of the following three conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Have a diagnosis of a medical condition that is expected to result in permanent&#xD;
                  diminished or complete loss of subsequent ovarian function (e.g. Turner's&#xD;
                  syndrome) OR have a diagnosis that will create a need for surgery, chemotherapy,&#xD;
                  drug treatment and/or radiation for the treatment or prevention of the condition&#xD;
                  (e.g lupus nephritis) or malignancy and is expected to result in permanent&#xD;
                  diminished or complete loss of subsequent ovarian function. Unlike in males where&#xD;
                  a semen analysis provides an objective measure of testicular function, ovarian&#xD;
                  reserve testing remains subjective by evaluation of hormones. Therefore, to&#xD;
                  objectively qualify a degree of expected diminished loss of fertility is&#xD;
                  difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Or, have a medical condition or malignancy that requires removal of all or part&#xD;
                  of one or both ovaries. Girls with ovarian or germ cell tumors requiring removal&#xD;
                  of all or part of one or both ovaries will also be eligible for inclusion in the&#xD;
                  study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Or, have a newly diagnosed or recurrent disease affecting fertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. For patients undergoing elective removal of all or part of an ovary for fertility&#xD;
             preservation only, they must have two ovaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Sign an approved informed consent and authorization permitting the release of personal&#xD;
             health information. The patient and/or the patient's legally authorized guardian must&#xD;
             acknowledge in writing that consent for specimen collection has been obtained, in&#xD;
             accordance with institutional policies approved by the U.S. Department of Health and&#xD;
             Human Services.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria: (Any exclusion criteria will disqualify.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Girls with psychological, psychiatric, or other conditions which prevent giving fully&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Girls whose underlying medical condition significantly increases their risk of&#xD;
             complications from anesthesia and surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects with extensive disease whose therapy is deemed palliative by the medical&#xD;
             oncologist will not be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects with suspected severe diminished ovarian reserve, such as a follicle&#xD;
             stimulating hormone (FSH) level of &gt; 15.&#xD;
