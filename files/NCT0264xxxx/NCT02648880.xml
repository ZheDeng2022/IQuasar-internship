  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of a preoperative exercise program in&#xD;
      patients with pancreatic cancer preparing for surgery. Preoperative exercise programs have&#xD;
      been shown to be effective in other cancer populations, but have not been investigated in&#xD;
      patients with pancreatic cancer. The outcomes in this study will be changes in physical&#xD;
      fitness, function, and postoperative outcomes. This investigation is a non-randomized control&#xD;
      trial, with participants assigned to receive the preoperative exercise intervention in&#xD;
      addition to standard care, or standard care alone if unable to commit to an exercise program&#xD;
      for practical reasons. Possible mediators for the effects of exercise on postoperative&#xD;
      outcomes will also be assessed, including psychological outcomes and markers of systemic&#xD;
      inflammation. These measures will be assessed in all participants prior to program&#xD;
      initiation, prior to surgery, and after surgery. Changes in these measures in response to&#xD;
      exercise will be assessed, as well as the ability of the preoperative measures to predict&#xD;
      postoperative outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study focuses on patients prescribed neoadjuvant (preoperative chemotherapy and&#xD;
      radiation) prior to surgery for borderline resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This allows&#xD;
      for a known, preoperative window long enough to provide an effective exercise intervention.&#xD;
      The exercise program will be administered for at least eight weeks, but has no cap on length,&#xD;
      as neoadjuvent treatment periods can vary between participants and a cessation of the&#xD;
      exercise program before the end of this period could result in an undesirable loss in&#xD;
      physical fitness and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a non-randomized, parallel group, intervention control trial, based on pilot&#xD;
      studies in similar patient populations. All participants meeting the inclusion criteria and&#xD;
      able to participate in the exercise program will be assigned to the exercise group.&#xD;
      Participants meeting the inclusion criteria, but unable to commit to the exercise program for&#xD;
      practical reasons (transportation, location, etc), will be assigned to the standard care&#xD;
      group.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will complete an exercise program in addition to standard care. Participants will start the exercise program within four weeks of their diagnosis and decision to undergo neoadjuvant treatment and continue until surgery. Participants will be encouraged to complete three sessions per week for at least eight weeks during neoadjuvant therapy. Exercise intensity, components, and time will be recorded for each exercise session. Participants will schedule their sessions with the exercise specialists administering the program, typically taking place between 8AM and 4PM, Monday through Friday.</description>

    <description>Individual exercise sessions in this program implement a &quot;whole body&quot; approach and consist of a 10-min cardiovascular warm-up and 50 minutes of cardiovascular endurance, resistance, and flexibility exercises. Target intensity of exercise will be based on the American College of Sports Medicine recommendations for cancer survivors. Prior to the start of exercise sessions, participants will be questioned on significant changes in symptoms or the presence of new symptoms (such as nausea or fever), which will used to modify the exercise session for that day to allow maximum symptom-limited participation.</description>
