      The overall goal of this study is to qualitatively assess the surgical decision-making&#xD;
      process from both the patient and physician perspective&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Conduct short in-person interviews with young women prior to surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Conduct focus groups with breast cancer survivors about their surgical decision and&#xD;
           experience&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Interview surgical oncologists, plastic surgeons, medical and radiation oncologists&#xD;
           about their experiences and how they communicate with breast cancer patients about local&#xD;
           therapy decisions&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To survey women about surgical decision-making prior to and after their consult in&#xD;
           conjunction with pilot testing of a web-based decision aid to support high quality&#xD;
           surgical decision-making in newly diagnosed young women with breast cancer.&#xD;

      Breast cancer in young women: Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women&#xD;
      younger than age 40 in the United States, with approximately 14,000 new cases each year.&#xD;
      Young women face unique psychosocial challenges, most notably fertility, sexuality, and image&#xD;
      concerns and are at a life stage where education, career, and family are important&#xD;
      priorities. Concern about these issues may contribute to the greater psychosocial distress&#xD;
      seen in younger women at both diagnosis and in follow-up compared with older women.&#xD;
      Importantly, these concerns may also influence treatment decisions including receipt of&#xD;
      chemotherapy, adherence to endocrine therapy, and surgical decisions. Thus, attending to the&#xD;
      unique issues of young women may enhance not only quality of care and quality of life (QOL)&#xD;
      but also potentially disease outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical management of breast cancer: Standard loco-regional management of breast cancer&#xD;
      entails partial mastectomy (i.e., breast conserving surgery) followed by radiation or&#xD;
      mastectomy with or without radiation. The decision depends on a number of factors including&#xD;
      extent of disease, family history, BRCA mutation status, and personal preference. In recent&#xD;
      years, an increasing number of women have elected to undergo contralateral prophylactic&#xD;
      mastectomy (CPM) in conjunction with surgery of the affected breast (usually choosing&#xD;
      bilateral mastectomy), despite a lack of clear evidence for survival benefit from this&#xD;
      procedure in the vast majority of women. In weighing the benefits and risks of CPM, one must&#xD;
      consider the absolute risk reduction of a new primary breast cancer (usually relatively&#xD;
      modest in the average risk survivor), the long and short-term risks of this additional&#xD;
      surgery including potential complications (bilateral mastectomy is associated with a greater&#xD;
      risk of surgical complications) and the impact on QOL. At the same time, one must consider&#xD;
      the competing risk of systemic recurrence of a woman's initial breast cancer. Young women, in&#xD;
      particular, have the greatest risk of systemic recurrence and death from their original&#xD;
      cancer, lowering the likelihood of benefit of CPM in preventing a new primary breast cancer.&#xD;
      However, while CPM rates have increased among all breast cancer patients, increased rates of&#xD;
      CPM are particularly pronounced among the youngest women with breast cancer, with several&#xD;
      studies identifying young age at diagnosis as one of the strongest determinants of&#xD;
      CPM.Physicians and researchers have been observing and discussing this trend for a number of&#xD;
      years and yet little has been done to intervene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the proposed research is to better understand and improve the surgical decision&#xD;
      process in young women with breast cancer. Using qualitative research methods, we will&#xD;
      comprehensively assess patient experiences - both patients who have had CPM and patients who&#xD;
      did not - as well as physician perspectives regarding this decision. Based on these findings,&#xD;
      the investigators will determine how to best improve the quality of the process, e.g., by&#xD;
      correcting misperceptions, setting realistic expectations regarding the impact of surgery&#xD;
      (including reconstruction) on QOL, improving communication with health care providers, and&#xD;
      better management of anxiety surrounding diagnosis. This qualitative research is designed to&#xD;
      build on prior quantitative analyses, by gaining an in depth perspective through focus groups&#xD;
      and interviews, about certain issues identified as impacting the surgical decision process,&#xD;
      including anxiety, fear of recurrence, and patient-physician communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collectively, results from the qualitative assessment will inform a future phase of this&#xD;
      research involving the design and subsequent development of a decision aid to help women make&#xD;
      informed decisions about their breast cancer surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this second phase of the research is to survey women about surgical&#xD;
      decision-making prior to and after their consult in conjunction with pilot testing of a&#xD;
      web-based decision aid to support high quality surgical decision-making in newly diagnosed&#xD;
      young women with breast cancer.&#xD;
