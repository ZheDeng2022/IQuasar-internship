  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic Girdle Pain (PGP) during pregnancy occurs in approximately 70% of females and 38% of&#xD;
      women continue to suffer PGP symptoms beyond 12 weeks following delivery. PGP post- partum&#xD;
      causes pain during everyday activities that impacts negatively on health related quality of&#xD;
      life and is associated with significant healthcare and societal costs. These women are often&#xD;
      referred to physiotherapy, however management is difficult and there is a weak evidence base&#xD;
      for its management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alongside the provision of advice and information, physiotherapists commonly prescribe&#xD;
      orthoses such as a rigid belt with the aim of optimising pelvic stability and reducing pain.&#xD;
      More recently a novel customised Dynamic Elastomeric Fabric Orthosis has been developed as an&#xD;
      alternative to an 'off the shelf' pelvic belt. No studies have investigated their&#xD;
      effectiveness in complementing standard physiotherapy advice and management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will undertake a comprehensive systematic review of the literature to&#xD;
      critically evaluate the evidence base for the conservative management of chronic post-partum&#xD;
      PGP. This will inform a single case experimental design. Here eight AB single case studies&#xD;
      will be performed with the point of intervention being randomised between subjects. The use&#xD;
      of a randomisation test permits subsequent statistical analyses of group effects.&#xD;
      Participants' pain, activity levels, and quality of life will be evaluated along with&#xD;
      subjective changes in confidence and urinary incontinence. Adherence to orthosis use will be&#xD;
      diarised. Exit interviews will assess aspects such as the appropriateness of the outcome&#xD;
      measures and acceptability of the intervention that will help to inform future clinical&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic girdle pain (PGP) occurs in 70% of pregnant women; of whom 25% have severe pain and 8%&#xD;
      severe disability requiring the use of crutches, wheelchair or confinement to bed (Wu et al,&#xD;
      2004). At a personal level, women with PGP find that everyday activities such as turning in&#xD;
      bed, prolonged walking, or carrying items may cause pain; impacting negatively on quality of&#xD;
      life (Wang et al, 2004). In economic terms societal costs are significant, mainly as a&#xD;
      consequence of work absenteeism; with 20% of people requiring an average of 7 weeks sick&#xD;
      leave (Noren et al, 1997). The impact of this problem is significant; with 812, 970&#xD;
      deliveries occurring throughout the UK in 2012/13&#xD;
      (http://www.statistics.gov.uk/hub/index.html). Pregnancy related PGP has also been documented&#xD;
      to increase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PGP during pregnancy is thought to occur due to increased pelvic joint motion as a&#xD;
      consequence of hormonal and biomechanical factors. For many women PGP symptoms resolve within&#xD;
      approximately 3 months of delivery, however, approximately 38% of females continue to&#xD;
      experience pain beyond 3 months following delivery (Gutke et al 2010, Van de Pol et al 2006).&#xD;
      It is unknown why chronic symptoms persist, but age, parity, pre- pregnancy body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI), mode of delivery and previous PGP, along with emotional and psychosocial factors have&#xD;
      been identified as risk factors associated with chronic PGP (Robinson et al, 2010)). Further,&#xD;
      women having caesarean section are at increased risk of post-partum chronic PGP, which is&#xD;
      noteworthy given the increasing percentage of women who are electing for caesarean section&#xD;
      for early symptomatic relief of peri-partum PGP. Urinary incontinence is also documented to&#xD;
      affect approximately 70% of females suffering with pregnancy related PGP. If PGP symptoms&#xD;
      continue into the post-partum then urinary incontinence is reported to continue due to an&#xD;
      association with PGP and pelvic floor muscle weakness (Fitzgerald et al, 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PGP is difficult to manage with limited guidance from the literature on conservative&#xD;
      management. European Guidelines recommend exercise prescription for PGP (Vleeming et al.,&#xD;
      2008) leading to the development of a Specialist Women's Health group information booklet&#xD;
      that will be used in the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An integral part of physiotherapists' management approach for PGP is the provision of&#xD;
      orthoses such as rigid pelvic belts, which aim to improve pelvic joint stability and thus&#xD;
      reduce pain. Pelvic belts apply forces to the pelvis within the transverse plane. Recently&#xD;
      dynamic elastomeric fabric orthoses (DEFO) have been developed. A DEFO is made of elastomeric&#xD;
      panels (e.g. Lycra Â®) that are pre-stretched and can provide forces in multiple directions to&#xD;
      the pelvis. Thus they provide continued multi-axis support whilst being flexible enough to&#xD;
      allow people to participate in everyday activities. Studies on sports people with pelvic&#xD;
      girdle pain have shown that the application of forces in more than one plane decreases pain&#xD;
      and improves function over and above that seen with the application of transverse forces&#xD;
      associated with pelvic belts (Sawle et al, 2013). Therefore the DEFO may have advantages over&#xD;
      current rigid pelvic belts in terms of mode of action, clinical effectiveness and user&#xD;
      satisfaction. To date a comprehensive literature search has revealed there have been no&#xD;
      trials of orthotic use in women with chronic PGP post-partum. This project will therefore&#xD;
      follow the recommendations of the Medical Research Council in the development and evaluation&#xD;
      of complex interventions to establish a clearer understanding of PGP and its management&#xD;
      post-partum that can inform future clinical trials.&#xD;
