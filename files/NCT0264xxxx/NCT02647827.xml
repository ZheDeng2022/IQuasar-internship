  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that acupuncture is equally effective as metformin (both treatments&#xD;
      combined with lifestyle management) in improving whole body glucose homeostasis in insulin&#xD;
      resistant women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and that both are superior to&#xD;
      lifestyle management alone. The investigators hypothesize that acupuncture and metformin&#xD;
      induce ovulation and improve hyperandrogenism, as well as health related quality of life&#xD;
      (HRQoL) and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Although equally effective (acupuncture and&#xD;
      metformin), the investigators hypothesize that acupuncture is associated with less negative&#xD;
      side-effects. The investigators also hypothesize that these treatments have the potential to&#xD;
      restore epigenetic and molecular alterations in target tissues (endometrial-, adipose-, and&#xD;
      skeletal muscle tissue) and thus have the potential to prevent the development of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes (T2D).&#xD;

      Specific Aims The purpose of the study is to perform a randomized controlled trial of women&#xD;
      with PCOS, comparing the effectiveness of lifestyle management alone, and in combination with&#xD;
      acupuncture or metformin treatment on whole body glucose homeostasis, with the ultimate goal&#xD;
      to prevent the development of type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To determine the clinical effectiveness of 4 months of 1) electroacupuncture + lifestyle&#xD;
      management and 2) metformin + lifestyle management, compared to 3) lifestyle management only,&#xD;
      for improvement of insulin sensitivity as measured by HOMA-IR, by the insulin response to&#xD;
      glucose assessed by calculating the area under the curve (AUCinsulin) during the oral glucose&#xD;
      tolerance test (OGTT), and by glucose regulation (assessed by analyzing Hba1c levels).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate changes in secondary metabolic measures, including fasting insulin,&#xD;
           c-peptide, glucose, and adipokines, calculation of HOMA-B (i.e. the Islet β-cell&#xD;
           function) and the c-peptide index, assessment of the adipokines and lipid profile, body&#xD;
           size and proportions and body fat distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine changes in genome-wide gene expression and DNA methylation profiles related&#xD;
           to insulin sensitivity in fat, muscle and endometrial tissue biopsies, and biomarkers in&#xD;
           whole blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate endocrine measures including menstrual pattern and ovulation frequency,&#xD;
           circulating hormones (sex steroids, AMH, gonadotropins), and excretion of metabolites of&#xD;
           sex steroids in urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine changes in women's HRQoL, symptoms of anxiety and depression, dieting and&#xD;
           eating patterns, and negative side-effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the different treatments.&#xD;
