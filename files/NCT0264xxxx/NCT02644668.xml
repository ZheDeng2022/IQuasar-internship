    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of CK-2127107 (hereafter referred to&#xD;
      as reldesemtiv) versus placebo on measures of skeletal muscle function or fatigability in&#xD;
      patients with Type II, III, or IV spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CY 5021 is a Phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multiple dose study of&#xD;
      reldesemtiv in 2 sequential ascending dose cohorts of patients with SMA. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized 2:1 to receive reldesemtiv or placebo twice daily for 8 weeks. Patients randomized&#xD;
      to reldesemtiv in Cohort 1 will receive a dose of 150 mg twice daily and patients randomized&#xD;
      to reldesemtiv in Cohort 2 will receive 450 mg twice daily. Within each cohort, randomization&#xD;
      will be stratified by ambulatory status (ambulatory versus non ambulatory).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the PD effects of reldesemtiv on measures&#xD;
      of pulmonary function, respiratory function, muscle strength, and motor function. Other PD&#xD;
      measures include changes in the timed up and go (TUG) test, a 6-minute walk test (6MWT), and&#xD;
      patient and investigator global assessments. Secondary objectives include the safety of&#xD;
      multiple doses of reldesemtiv and an evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of reldesemtiv.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 8 in Forced Vital Capacity (FVC)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>FVC was measured using a calibrated spirometer (in units of liters). Patients were instructed to take as deep an inspiration as possible followed by a maximum exhalation (blowing out all the air in their lungs).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 8 in Maximum Inspiratory Pressure (MIP)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>MIP was measured (in units of cm H20) using a calibrated spirometer with an inspiratory pressure valve attached. For the test, patients were asked to inhale as forcefully as possible, to their maximum pressure.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 8 in Maximum Expiratory Pressure (MEP)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>MEP was measured (in units of cm H20) using a calibrated spirometer with an exspiratory pressure valve attached. For the test, patients were asked to maximally inhale then perform a forced exhalation with as forcefully as possible.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle Strength Mega-Score at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle strength of 3 muscle groups (elbow flexion, knee extension, and shoulder abduction) were measured bilaterally using a hand-held dynamometer. Muscle strength was measured twice for each body location; if the variability between the 2 measures was &gt; 15%, a third measure was obtained.&#xD;
The maximum muscle strength of the 2 measurements was identified and transformed as a percent change from baseline using the equation: ([postbaseline value - baseline value] / baseline value) × 100.&#xD;
The mega-score was a composite score that averaged strength across the 3 muscle groups. It was calculated as the mean of the non-missing transformed muscle strength scores among the 3 muscle groups each measure bilaterally (totaling 6 body locations).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 8 in the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale-Expanded (HFMS-E)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The HFMS-E evaluated the level of independent mobility and motor skills through assessment of 33 test-items, each scored from 0 (worse) to 2 (better). The total score was calculated as the sum of the scores among the 33 test items, and has a range from 0 to 66.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 8 in Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The RULM assessed motor function in the upper limbs (specifically shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand function) that related to activities of everyday life. The RULM consisted of 20 items, 1 of which was scored on a 7-point scale (from 0 to 6), 18 were scored on a 3-point scale (from 0 to 2), and 1 was scored on a 2-point scale (0 or 1). The total score was the sum of each response and could range from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 43 points. Higher scores reflected better motor function.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 8 in the TUG Test</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The TUG test measured the time (in seconds) it took for a patient to rise from a chair, walk 3 meters, turn around, walk back to the chair and sit down.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 8 in the 6MWT</measure>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Patients with SMA were enrolled at 18 sites in Canada and the United States. The first patient was enrolled on 14 January 2016 and the last patient completed on 31 May 2018.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Eligible patients were male or female, ≥12 y of age and had a genetically confirmed diagnosis of SMA. Ambulatory patients were able to walk ≥50 m in 6 min; and non-ambulatory patients were able to tolerate upright sitting with support for 3 h. Patients had an FVC &gt;20% predicted, an HFMS-E score ≥10 and ≤54, and elbow and knee flexion ≤90 degrees.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Muscle Strength Mega-Score at Week 8</title>
        <description>Muscle strength of 3 muscle groups (elbow flexion, knee extension, and shoulder abduction) were measured bilaterally using a hand-held dynamometer. Muscle strength was measured twice for each body location; if the variability between the 2 measures was &gt; 15%, a third measure was obtained.&#xD;
The maximum muscle strength of the 2 measurements was identified and transformed as a percent change from baseline using the equation: ([postbaseline value - baseline value] / baseline value) × 100.&#xD;
The mega-score was a composite score that averaged strength across the 3 muscle groups. It was calculated as the mean of the non-missing transformed muscle strength scores among the 3 muscle groups each measure bilaterally (totaling 6 body locations).</description>

        <description>The RULM assessed motor function in the upper limbs (specifically shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand function) that related to activities of everyday life. The RULM consisted of 20 items, 1 of which was scored on a 7-point scale (from 0 to 6), 18 were scored on a 3-point scale (from 0 to 2), and 1 was scored on a 2-point scale (0 or 1). The total score was the sum of each response and could range from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 43 points. Higher scores reflected better motor function.</description>
