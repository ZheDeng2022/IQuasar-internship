  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-centre open label study will involve a minimum of 120 patients in 2 cohorts: 60&#xD;
      patients with 'early UC' defined as disease duration &lt; 4 years and no other treatments than&#xD;
      aminosalicylates and/or corticosteroids and 60 patients with 'late UC' defined as active&#xD;
      disease despite treatment with immunosuppressives (IS) and/or anti-TNF. Patients wih&#xD;
      intolerance to IS AND anti-TNF will also be allowed in the latter group. Participants will be&#xD;
      treated with 12 months of open label vedolizumab and undergo monitoring of endoscopic,&#xD;
      histological and clinical disease parameters. No randomization or blinding will be performed&#xD;
      but the study management will make sure recruitment in either study group is comparable for&#xD;
      number and profile of patients (extent of disease and on/off corticosteroids).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colon. Symptoms include&#xD;
      bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and fever. There is no known cause or cure for UC. The aim of&#xD;
      current UC treatments is to induce and maintain remission, to reduce the need of&#xD;
      corticosteroids and avoid colectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment options include 5-Aminosalicylates (5-ASA), systemic and/or topical&#xD;
      corticosteroids, purine analogues (6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine), anti-TNF antibodies&#xD;
      and surgery. In 2013, results from the GEMINI I, phase 3, randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      demonstrated the efficacy of vedolizumab (VDZ) in inducing and maintaining remission in adult&#xD;
      patients with active UC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VDZ (MLN0002 or MLN02), inhibits the interaction between α4β7 integrin on memory T and B&#xD;
      cells and mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 expressed on the vascular endothelium of&#xD;
      the gut and has been shown to be effective in both inducing and maintaining clinical&#xD;
      remission in UC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With other (anti-TNF) biologics, outcomes have usually been better if the treatment was&#xD;
      started earlier in the disease course and if the patients had not been exposed to prior&#xD;
      antibody treatments. Therefore, it appears appropriate and desirable to test the potency of&#xD;
      vedolizumab in an earlier phase of UC. Indeed, also with vedolizumab patients previously&#xD;
      exposed to biologics appear to have lower success rates with vedolizumab, so a position&#xD;
      earlier in the disease course would most likely lead to better outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigator-initiated open label study of VDZ therapy in 2 distinct populations&#xD;
      of UC patients with active disease: 1. patients who have been diagnosed &lt; 4 years ago and who&#xD;
      only have been exposed to aminosalicylates and corticosteroids and 2. patients who have been&#xD;
      exposed to immunomodulators and/or anti-TNF agents in addition to steroids and&#xD;
      aminosalicylates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VDZ has been shown to be efficacious at inducing and maintaining remission in UC. However,&#xD;
      data about the endoscopic and histological effects of VDZ in 'early UC' are lacking.&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators propose to perform an interventional study in early and late UC&#xD;
      patients including endoscopic and histological assessment&#xD;
