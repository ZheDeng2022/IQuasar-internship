  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity has demonstrated its beneficial effect on functional capabilities and&#xD;
      quality of life in patients with PD. However, the daily physical activity remains limited in&#xD;
      these patients. Rhythmic auditory cueing improves spatio-temporal gait parameters in patients&#xD;
      with PD. The first results of BeatHealth studies have allowed us to identify the best musical&#xD;
      stimulation to improve these parameters and the motivation of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The originality of this study is to propose a gait auto-rehabilitation program using&#xD;
      BeatHealth device with optimal auditory cueing during four weeks in ecological conditions in&#xD;
      PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observance (utilization's time), safety (falls, pain, fatigability) and efficacy (gait&#xD;
      parameters, balance, quality of life) will be evaluated.&#xD;

      Objectives Main goal: To evaluate the observance of the use of BeatHealth device in gait&#xD;
      auto-rehabilitation program in patients with PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate safety by the number of falls&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate tolerance by the evaluation of pain and fatigue&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the expected improvement on gate and quality of life essentialy&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To identify predictive factors associated with a good response to the program&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate the technical feasibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Methods Design : prospective and descriptive study Population : 60 patients with PD&#xD;
           Inclusion criteria : PD diagnosed according the international criteria form the United&#xD;
           Kingdom Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank ; gait disorder identified by the&#xD;
           neurologist or the rehabilitation doktor ; to be able to work 30 minutes consecutively&#xD;
           and without technical support Non inclusion criteria : signs for atypical parkinsonism&#xD;
&#xD;
           Main evaluation criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Percentage of time of use of the BeatHealth device compared to the prescribed schedule&#xD;
           (30 minutes of walk, 5 times a week during four weeks : 10 hours for the complete study)&#xD;
           .&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary evaluation criteria :&#xD;
&#xD;
           n°1 - Auto-evalation of the number of falls reported by the patient on a daily agenda&#xD;
           before and during the rehabilitation program.&#xD;
&#xD;
           n°2 - Auto-evalation of pain with a visual analogic scale on a daily agenda before and&#xD;
           during the rehabilitation program.&#xD;
&#xD;
           n°3 - (a) gait functional capabilities; (b) spatio-temporal parameters of gait; (c)&#xD;
           motot severity of the disease(d) balance ; (e) quality of life ; (f) psychopathological&#xD;
           evaluations (g) auditory-sensori-motor and timing capabilities (h) sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
           n°4 - Numbers of correct connections to the program, number of errors of manipulations,&#xD;
           number of phone calls for help.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistical analysis : In the randomized control study on 21 patients from Martin et al.&#xD;
           (2015) evaluating a rehabilitation programm on rythmic auditory cueing by metronome in&#xD;
           patients with PD wiht fall potential, program observance was 83% according to self&#xD;
           evaluation by the patients. In our study , to estimate this percentage of about 80% with&#xD;
           an accuracy of ± 10% (interval of 20%) with a confidance interval of 95, the number of&#xD;
           subjects to include is 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Main statistical analysis : in order to evaluate the observance of the BeatHealth&#xD;
           device, the percentage of the time of use conpared to the prescribed time (10 hours in&#xD;
           total)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Program schedule :&#xD;
&#xD;
           Number of visits : 3 Inclusion period : 7 months Follow-up : 2 weeks (from the inclusion&#xD;
           to the beginning of the program) + 4 weeks (program) Calendar of the study : january&#xD;
           2016 - october 2016&#xD;
&#xD;
           Content of the visites :&#xD;
&#xD;
           V0=Inclusion / identification of the favorite musical genres of the patient /&#xD;
           Explanation and delivery of the agenda.&#xD;

           V1=&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Evalutation criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Information and training to the BeatHealth device use (sensors, smartphone use,&#xD;
                connexion to the cloud for the transfer of the results)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Operating instructions delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Explanation of the rehabilitation program (number of sessions, duration, place…)&#xD;

             -  Communication of the contact details of the maintenance operator V2= identical to&#xD;
                V1 (except for predictive factors).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Description of the intervention The auto-rehabilitation program will consist in an&#xD;
           outside walk, during 5 sessions of 30 minutes per week during 4 weeks with the&#xD;
           beatHealth device, delivering the optimal rythmic auditory cueing. The device will&#xD;
           associate an Android smartphone, hold at the belt, connected by bluetooth to a headphone&#xD;
           and to two sensors strapped to the ankles. The patient will transfer the data collected&#xD;
           by BeatHealth to a secured website and will complete the agenda&#xD;
