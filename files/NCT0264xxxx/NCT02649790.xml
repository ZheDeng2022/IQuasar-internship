    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, multi-center, open-label clinical study with separate dose&#xD;
      escalation (Phase 1) and expansion (Phase 2) stages to assess preliminary safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and efficacy of the second generation oral XPO1 inhibitor KPT-8602 in&#xD;
      participants with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM), metastatic colorectal cancer&#xD;
      (mCRC), metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), and higher risk&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation and dose expansion may be included for all parts of the study as determined&#xD;
      by ongoing study results.&#xD;
