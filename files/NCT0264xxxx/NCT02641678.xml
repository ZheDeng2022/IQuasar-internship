      Prospective mono-center diagnostic study determining potential discrepancies in identifying&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation by intraindividually comparing different types of follow-up strategies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How many stroke patients with atrial fibrillation are missed by standard stroke unit&#xD;
           24h- electrocardiography, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. what is the effectiveness of the extended invasive and non-invasive ECG analysis tools&#xD;
           to detect atrial fibrillation in stroke patients?&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation often is paroxysmal and asymptomatic and, therefore, often not detected.&#xD;
      Because atrial fibrillation is the leading risk factor for ischemic stroke, and oral&#xD;
      anticoagulation is very efficacious for both primary and secondary stroke prevention in&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation patients, detection of atrial fibrillation is essential to prevent stroke&#xD;
      and stroke-induced disability and death. The incidence of atrial fibrillation and paroxysmal&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation is particularly high in stroke patients. Short duration monitoring&#xD;
      identified new atrial fibrillation in only about 5% to 10% of stroke patients. Estimates of&#xD;
      missed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in stroke patients go up to 40 000 patients in Germany&#xD;
      per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the known poor sensitivity of a 24h-ECG, all patients with stroke of unknown cause&#xD;
      will undergo the above mentioned non-invasive and invasive ECG monitoring. Based on the data&#xD;
      of these extended ECG-analyses, the rate of missed AF in conventionally diagnosed stroke unit&#xD;
      patients could be determined by comparison to the 24h-ECG results. Additionally, a&#xD;
      cost-benefit equation of the different ECG analysis tools will be calculated by comparison of&#xD;
      the respective detection rates and the known follow-up costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Patients years with acute ischemic stroke of unknown cause, monitored on&#xD;
      a stroke unit undergoing routine diagnostic procedures (conventional 12-lead-ECG, 24h-ECG,&#xD;
      echocardiography, cranial computed tomography or cranial magnetic resonance tomography,&#xD;
      Transcranial Doppler and carotid duplex ultrasound, long-term blood pressure monitoring,&#xD;
      standard laboratory investigations) Exclusion criteria: Stroke with known etiology, Stroke&#xD;
      caused by intracranial hemorrhage&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis-as-usual:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Standard 24h-ECG on stroke units according to existing guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-invasive:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Online ECG analysis during the standardized stroke unit- monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ambulatory 7-day ECG monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      Invasive:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - atrial fibrillation detection by a permanently implantable direct cardiac rhythm monitor&#xD;
      device in a period of up to 6 month&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of measures per patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 weeks hospitalization, ~1 month rehabilitation, then implantation of the ECG device, and 6&#xD;
      months follow-up: 7.5 months in total&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the prevalence of undiagnosed AF in stroke patients undergoing the diagnostic&#xD;
      standard (24h-ECG)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effectivity and cost-effectiveness ratios of the different ECG analyis tools&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the obtained data, the prevalence of undiagnosed atrial fibrillation in stroke&#xD;
      patients whom atrial fibrillation is missed by the standard diagnostic procedure (24h-ECG)&#xD;
      will be determined by different extensive non-invasive and invasive ECG monitoring tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, following values of the applied ECG analysis tools will be calculated and&#xD;
      compared:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sensitivity: (true positives) / (true positives + false negatives)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specificity: (true negatives) / (true negatives + false positives)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Positive predicted value: (true positives) / (true positives + false positives)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Negative predicted value: (true negatives) / (true negatives + false negatives)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implantable direct cardiac rhythm monitor device is an established and widely used&#xD;
      diagnostic procedure in patients with unexplained syncope.&#xD;

    <time_frame>7.5 months</time_frame>
    <description>The data can be helpful to increase the cost efficacy. There are 3 hypotheses. 1.) The software analysis is reliable enough to detect AF than an implantable device is no longer needed.&#xD;
2.) The software analysis is unreliable 3.) The software analysis has a high negative predictive value and can provide as a preselection tool. Patients with probable AF calculated by the software analysis have a higher profit by the implantation than the patient with no AF calculated by the software.</description>
