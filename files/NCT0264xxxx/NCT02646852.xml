    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, two-arm, dose escalation study of PLX038 intravenous infusion&#xD;
      administered to patients with refractory or relapsed solid tumors. This study will explore&#xD;
      two different dosing schedules: Arm 1, once every 3 week (q3w), and Arm 2, once weekly for 2&#xD;
      consecutive weeks of a 4-week cycle.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PLX038 is an investigational drug product that has demonstrated reasonable antitumor activity&#xD;
      in preclinical colorectal, gastric and lung tumor models in animals. This is a first in human&#xD;
      trial to determine the maximum, safest dose of PLX038 IV that can be administered to patients&#xD;
      either once every 3 weeks or once every 2 weeks.&#xD;
