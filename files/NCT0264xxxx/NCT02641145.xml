    <textblock>
      Cardiac amyloidosis is a major cause of early treatment-related death and poor overall&#xD;
      survival in individuals with systemic light chain amyloidosis. This project will develop a&#xD;
      novel approach to visualize cardiac amyloid deposits using advanced imaging methods. The&#xD;
      long-term goal of this work is to identify the mechanisms of cardiac dysfunction, in order to&#xD;
      guide the development of novel life-saving treatments.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary light chain amyloidosis (AL) is the most common systemic amyloidosis, resulting from&#xD;
      a plasma cell dyscrasia, a hematological malignancy. It causes a restrictive cardiomyopathy&#xD;
      (AL-CMP) in over 70% of individuals. AL-CMP is as lethal as stage 4 lung cancer and more&#xD;
      lethal than any other form of restrictive heart disease; if untreated, the mortality rate is&#xD;
      50% within 18 months. Moreover, myocardial dysfunction, the hallmark of AL-CMP, significantly&#xD;
      increases early treatment related mortality, predominantly cardiovascular death, and is a&#xD;
      powerful predictor of poor long-term survival. Two potentially treatable mechanisms underlie&#xD;
      myocardial dysfunction-mechanical effects of amyloid and toxic effects from circulating light&#xD;
      chain/ amyloid interactions-and predispose to heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden death in&#xD;
      individuals with AL-CMP. Until now, efforts to determine the mechanisms of AL-CMP have been&#xD;
      hampered by a lack of animal models and the limitations of noninvasive techniques to directly&#xD;
      image myocardial amyloid. A recent breakthrough, 18F-florbetapir PET/CT, has provided for the&#xD;
      first time specific and quantitative imaging of myocardial amyloid including toxic amyloid&#xD;
      protofibrils. Furthermore, we propose to investigate three pre-clinically proven pathways of&#xD;
      light chain toxicity in humans-myocardial oxidative metabolism, oxidative stress, and&#xD;
      coronary microvascular function. Our central hypotheses are that myocardial 18F-florbetapir&#xD;
      retention is a biomarker for aggressiveness of AL-CMP and that effective chemotherapy will,&#xD;
      by reducing circulating light chains, decrease aggressiveness of AL-CMP and improve oxidative&#xD;
      stress, myocardial oxidative metabolism, microvascular function and contractile function,&#xD;
      prior to an improvement in myocardial amyloid content. In Aim 1, we will quantify myocardial&#xD;
      18F-florbetapir retention as a marker of aggressive myocardial disease in individuals with&#xD;
      AL-CMP and active plasma cell dyscrasia compared to control individuals with AL-CMP and&#xD;
      long-term hematological remission. In Aim 2, we propose, using advanced imaging, to assess&#xD;
      the effects of light chain reduction due to chemotherapy on myocardial structure, function,&#xD;
      and metabolism and define the time course of these changes. Serial ECV and strain imaging by&#xD;
      CMR, serum F2-isoprostanes and peroxynitrite levels, myocardial oxidative metabolism (Kmono)&#xD;
      and coronary flow reserve by 11C-acetate PET, and 18F-florbetapir imaging will not only&#xD;
      intricately characterize the myocardial substrate in AL-CMP, but also identify changes in&#xD;
      response to therapy. The proposed studies offer the potential to transform our current&#xD;
      understanding of AL-CMP as a restrictive heart disease caused by passive amyloid-related&#xD;
      architectural damage to that of a more complex disorder resulting from both passive and&#xD;
      aggressive factors. The results of these studies may form the foundation for drug discovery&#xD;
      programs to prevent and cure AL-CMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interactions of environmental factors, immunity, and host-related factors likely trigger&#xD;
      AL-amyloidosis, but have not yet been explored. Changes in metal ions and gut microbiota may&#xD;
      be causal, representing the integrated effects of all these factors, or may be the downstream&#xD;
      effect of systemic amyloid deposition in the organ systems. A plethora of recent literature&#xD;
      strongly support the role of microbiota in the pathogenesis of several diseases, suggesting&#xD;
      that gut microbiota changes with age, influences heart failure (HF) outcomes, and plays a&#xD;
      role in the formation of Î²-amyloid deposits in Alzheimer's disease. Importantly, alterations&#xD;
      in lifestyle, diet, prebiotics, probiotics, or phenols and gut microbiota may represent&#xD;
      therapeutic and preventative strategies in amyloid disease, but it has not been explored in&#xD;
      AL-amyloidosis. We propose to study the role of salivary and gut microbiome in AL&#xD;
      amyloidosis.&#xD;
