    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of pain relief after infusion of&#xD;
      ropivacaine at port sites at end of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC)compared with placebo&#xD;
      (0.9% normal saline).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients were randomly assigned to two groups, On Day 1,each subject was to undergo&#xD;
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia. Anesthesia will be induced with&#xD;
      fentanly (2-4ug/kg), propofol TCI (4ug/ml), rocuronium (0.6mg/kg), and maintaine with&#xD;
      remifentanly(0.1-0.3ug/kg.h) , and propofol TCI (3-5ug/ml). At the end of the operation&#xD;
      before wound closure, patients were randomized 1:1 to receive ropivacaine or placebo. In&#xD;
      study group all wounds were infiltrated with 0.75% ropivacaine 14ml at port sites before&#xD;
      wound closure(6ml for epigastric port ,6ml for umbilical port ,and 4ml for working port) .&#xD;
      The study drugs will be applied to the skin, subcutis, fascia, and parietal peritoneum&#xD;
      through the port sites at the end of surgery. All anesthetics will be stopped when wound&#xD;
      infiltration completed. Patients will be send to PACU for monitor a while then back to ward.&#xD;
      Record of pain intensity evaluation and rescue analgesic medication consumption were to&#xD;
      continue through 48hours after administration of study drug. Pain intensity will be assessed&#xD;
      by using a 0-10 point VAS scale. VAS-rest and VAS-coughing were recorded at the baseline&#xD;
      ,2,4,6,8,12,18,24,48 hours. Postoperative Rescue analgesia consisit of Parecoxib Sodium 40mg&#xD;
      be given by a nurse on requst of the subject to a maximum of 80mg per day.&#xD;
