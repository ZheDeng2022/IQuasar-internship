  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe pain following shoulder surgery is common and remains a major challenge. The&#xD;
      interscalene nerve block is well suited for operations on the shoulder or upper arm, for&#xD;
      providing surgical anesthesia as well as prolonged effective postoperative analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modern ultrasound guided ISB (US-ISB) allows for more accurate, targeted deposition of local&#xD;
      anesthetic. The current trend is to lower the volume of local anesthetic for&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided interscalene block in order to reduce potential complications such as&#xD;
      phrenic nerve paralysis and local anesthetic toxicity. However, at low volumes the analgesic&#xD;
      duration of the block could be compromised. Studies to elucidate the best local anesthetic&#xD;
      agent, concentration and adjuncts to prolong analgesia at low volumes are needed. Ropivacaine&#xD;
      and Bupivacaine are long acting local anesthetics commonly used for peripheral nerve blocks,&#xD;
      however, there are no studies comparing their analgesic duration in the setting of low volume&#xD;
      interscalene block to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate the analgesic duration of 0.5% Ropivacaine versus 0.5%&#xD;
      Bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine versus 1% Ropivacaine for low volume US-ISB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to conduct a comparison of the duration of post operative analgesia achieved&#xD;
      by these agents, hence allowing the appropriate local anesthetic agent and concentration&#xD;
      selection in low-volume techniques.&#xD;

      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      0.5 % Bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine and 1% Ropivicaine provide longer duration&#xD;
      analgesia than 0.5% Ropivicaine following a low dose ultrasound guided interscalene brachial&#xD;
      plexus block (US-ISB)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe pain following shoulder surgery is common and remains a major challenge. The&#xD;
      interscalene approach to the brachial plexus is particularly well suited for operations on&#xD;
      the shoulder or upper arm for providing surgical anesthesia as well as prolonged effective&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the benefits, the interscalene approach may present risks and complications. Common&#xD;
      complications of the interscalene nerve block include phrenic nerve blockade , Horner's&#xD;
      syndrome, recurrent laryngeal nerve blockade, and vasculature puncture. Rare, but potentially&#xD;
      devastating, complications include carotid artery puncture and intervertebral artery&#xD;
      injection, pneumothorax, subdural injection, intervertebral foramina injection resulting in&#xD;
      spinal or epidural anesthesia, nerve injury and local anesthetic toxicity have been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of ultrasound (US) in regional anesthesia has allowed for easy visualization of the&#xD;
      nerve, the needle, and the dispersion of the anesthetic, facilitating adequate injection in&#xD;
      the perineural region. US-guided blocks have been associated with high success rates, reduced&#xD;
      latencies, and reduced LA doses. A number of recent studies have confirmed that the use of&#xD;
      ultrasound (US) also allows for a significant reduction in the local anesthetic volume for an&#xD;
      effective interscalene nerve block. This reduction in volume of local anesthetic not only&#xD;
      translates into reduced risk of local anesthetic toxicity but also a substantial reduction in&#xD;
      the incidence of phrenic nerve paralysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the available research to date it appears that an effective interscalene block can&#xD;
      be performed with a small volume of 5 ml of local anesthetic while minimizing the incidence&#xD;
      of phrenic nerve palsy and local anesthetic toxicity. Based on the limited data available&#xD;
      thus far the analgesic duration of the block does not appear to be compromised with the low&#xD;
      volume techniques. However the critics of the low volume US-ISB persist with the belief that&#xD;
      low-volume techniques, with their reduced local anesthetic dose, inherently produce a shorter&#xD;
      duration block of lesser quality compared to higher volume. To date there are no studies&#xD;
      comparing the analgesic duration of available and commonly used long acting local anesthetics&#xD;
      in the setting of low-volume ISB technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bupivacaine and ropivicaine are the preferred long acting local anesthetics as they provide&#xD;
      prolonged analgesia in the postoperative period. However, ropivacaine due to its reduced&#xD;
      lipophilicity is generally considered less potent than bupivacaine with a shorter duration of&#xD;
      action . The magnitude of this potency difference however is not clearly quantified and&#xD;
      differs with varying techniques. In some studies, the potency difference amounts up to 50%&#xD;
      whereas in other studies the difference is negligible. This may be due to the fact that this&#xD;
      potency difference is dose dependent phenomenon. Ropivacaine has similar potency to&#xD;
      bupivacaine at higher doses (e.g., doses required for peripheral nerve blocks for surgical&#xD;
      anesthesia), ropivacaine is less potent than bupivacaine at lower doses, such as those used&#xD;
      for epidural or intrathecal analgesia .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clearly for low volume US-ISB, ropivicaine's potentially improved safety profile becomes&#xD;
      clinically insignificant, and the dose dependent reduced potency may play an important role&#xD;
      in decreasing the duration of analgesia. Previous studies looking at the performance of&#xD;
      ropivicaine and bupivicaine for upper extremity peripheral nerve blocks have only been done&#xD;
      in high volume settings. In these studies the high dose of local anesthetic used may have&#xD;
      masked any difference in potency of bupivacaine and ropivicaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clearly future studies are needed to better define the analgesic duration of low volumes&#xD;
      US-ISB and determine the effects of different local anesthetics, different concentrations and&#xD;
      adjuncts on the duration and quality of the block at these low volumes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the analgesic duration of 0.5% ropivacaine versus 0.5% bupivacaine with&#xD;
      1:200,000 epinephrine versus 1% ropivacaine for low volume US-ISB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients scheduled for arthroscopic shoulder surgery will be approached for participation by&#xD;
      research assistants in the pre-operative anesthetic clinic. Patients providing informed&#xD;
      consent will be allocated to one of three groups using a computer generated random number&#xD;
      table and blinding of group allocation will be maintained with sequentially numbered, sealed,&#xD;
      opaque envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of surgery, patients will be pre-medicated with oral acetaminophen 1000mg (650mg&#xD;
      if &lt; 60kg), and oral celecoxib 400mg (200mg if &lt; 60kg). Once intravenous access is secure and&#xD;
      standard monitors applied (electrocardiogram, non-invasive blood pressure cuff, continuous&#xD;
      oxygen saturation), patients will receive sedation with intravenous midazolam (1-2mg). The&#xD;
      lateral aspect of the neck including the supraclavicular fossa ipsilateral to the surgical&#xD;
      site will be cleansed with an isopropyl alcohol/chlorhexidine gluconate solution. The&#xD;
      US-guided ISB will be performed under sterile conditions by a staff regional&#xD;
      anesthesiologist, or regional anesthesia fellow. The ISB will be performed using a 13-6 MHz&#xD;
      38-mm linear US probe with appropriate sterile barrier (M-Turbo®; SonoSite Inc., Bothell, WA)&#xD;
      at the upper trunk level via posterior approach with a 22-gauge insulated 50-mm regional&#xD;
      block needle (Stimuplex®; B.Braun Medical, Bethlehem, PA). After satisfactory position of the&#xD;
      needle tip is achieved and visualized, the injectate will be administered slowly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The local anesthetic injectate will be prepared in a blinded syringe by trained anesthesia&#xD;
      assistants that are aware of group allocation but will take no further part in study&#xD;
      procedures or assessments. This individual will prepare the injectate in a 5ml syringe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All other personnel - patients, anesthesiologists performing the ISB or caring for the&#xD;
      patient in the operating theatre, surgeons, research assistants performing outcome measures,&#xD;
      and statisticians - will remain blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The block will be assessed at 20 minute intervals, using loss of pinprick sensation to C5/C6&#xD;
      dermatome and strength of shoulder abduction. Patients will be excluded if there is no&#xD;
      evidence of both sensory and motor block at 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo general anesthesia with a standardized induction technique using&#xD;
      fentanyl 1mcg/kg, and propofol 1-3mg /kg. Endotracheal intubation will be facilitated with&#xD;
      rocuronium 0.6mg/kg if necessary or a laryngeal mask airway can be placed for spontaneously&#xD;
      breathing patients. Anesthesia will be maintained using the inhalational anesthetic&#xD;
      sevoflurane (Abbott Corp) with an end-tidal concentration of 1.4 - 2%. Muscle relaxation will&#xD;
      be reversed using a combination of neostigmine (0.04mg/kg) and glycopyrrolate (0.007mg/kg) in&#xD;
      necessary. Supplementary intraoperative opioids for pain (systolic blood pressure or heart&#xD;
      rate increase from baseline of greater than 10% from surgical stimulus) will be given at the&#xD;
      discretion of the attending anesthesiologist (intravenous hydromorphone [0.2 mg per bolus] or&#xD;
      fentanyl [25 ug per bolus]) intravenous . Standard anti-emetic prophylaxis with the serotonin&#xD;
      antagonist ondansetron will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arrival to the recovery room, pain (Verbal Response Score ≥4 or patient request for&#xD;
      analgesia) will be treated with hydromorphone in 0.2-0.4mg increments every 5 minutes as&#xD;
      needed. Once oral intake is initiated, patients will receive one of two oral analgesic&#xD;
      preparations as needed: Tylenol #3® (acetaminophen 325 mg/codeine 30 mg/caffeine 15 mg per&#xD;
      tablet), or oxycocet (acetaminophen 325 mg/oxycodone HCl 5 mg per tablet) if intolerant to&#xD;
      codeine. Upon discharge from hospital, patients will receive a prescription for Tylenol #3®&#xD;
      as needed, or oxycocet if intolerant to codeine. After discharge, patients will complete a&#xD;
      home diary and return to the study team using a stamped, return-addressed envelope. Patients&#xD;
      will be asked to record the time at which they first experience pain at the surgical site,&#xD;
      the time when they first consume prescribed opioid analgesics for surgical site pain and&#xD;
      regain normal (or baseline equivalent) strength in their biceps and hand. On postoperative&#xD;
      days (POD) 1, 2 at 12h00 patients will be requested to document interval oral analgesic&#xD;
      consumption, presence of nausea or vomiting, presence of weakness in the operative arm, and&#xD;
      presence of paresthesia (numbness or tingling) in the operative arm. The doses of oral&#xD;
      codeine or oxycodone consumed by each patient will be converted into equianalgesic doses of&#xD;
      conversion ratios will be employed according to the general monograph for opioids in the&#xD;
      Canadian Pharmacists' Association Compendium of Pharmaceuticals and Specialties (36th ed.,&#xD;
      2001) as follows: oral oxycodone: oral morphine sulphate = 1:2, and oral codeine: oral&#xD;
      morphine sulphate = 6.6:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the investigator's clinical experience with low dose US-ISB (Ropivacaine 0.5% 5ml)&#xD;
      as well as previously published work, Investigators expect analgesic duration of 12 hours&#xD;
      with a standard deviation of 4 hours. The sample size calculation is based on being able to&#xD;
      detect a difference of 30% (3.6 hours ) in duration of analgesia between the three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that 57 patients are required (19 per group) to achieve 80% power to detect&#xD;
      differences among the means versus the alternative of equal means using an F test with a 0.05&#xD;
      significance level. The size of the variation in the means is represented by their standard&#xD;
      deviation, which is 1.70. The common standard deviation within a group is assumed to be 4.00.&#xD;
      To account for incomplete data or loss to follow-up, the plan is to recruit 60 patients&#xD;
      total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected on a customized case report form that includes all relevant&#xD;
      demographic and intra-operative data as well as each outcome sought. Patients will be&#xD;
      provided with a home diary to complete that will capture all outcomes sought that are not&#xD;
      obtained in hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data will be summarized and expressed using appropriate measures of central&#xD;
      tendency and dispersion for continuous data, and frequency for categorical data. The primary&#xD;
      outcome, time to first sensation of pain at the surgical site, will be summarized as mean&#xD;
      (SD) or median (IQR) after testing the data for normality with the Kolmogrov Smirnoff test.&#xD;
      This will also determine whether groups will be compared with the t-test (for normally&#xD;
      distributed data) or Kaplan Meier Survival Curves (for skewed data). Secondary outcomes that&#xD;
      are time based will also be assessed in the above manner (time to first analgesic request,&#xD;
      duration of motor block). Continuous secondary outcomes (opioid consumption, VRS, room air&#xD;
      SpO2) will be assessed with repeated measures ANOVA or the Mann Whitney U-test for&#xD;
      non-parametric data. Categorical outcomes will be compared with the Chi square or Fisher's&#xD;
      exact test as necessary.&#xD;
