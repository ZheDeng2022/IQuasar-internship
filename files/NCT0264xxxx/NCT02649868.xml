  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver cancer begins in the cells of the liver. It can be treated with chemotherapy,&#xD;
      radiation, or even a liver transplant. A less invasive treatment may be able to help some&#xD;
      people with liver cancer. It is called percutaneous transarterial embolization (TAE). For&#xD;
      TAE, a material is injected into blood vessels to block the blood flow that is feeding the&#xD;
      tumor. Researchers want to test a new material for TAE that may shrink tumors and can be seen&#xD;
      on x-ray and CT images. The embolization may sometimes be combined with thermal ablation, or&#xD;
      cooking tumors with needles that deliver heat by electricity or microwave.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test an embolization material called an LC LUMI beads. To see if it can block blood&#xD;
      vessels that provide blood to cancerous tumors and to see how the beads look on x-ray and CT&#xD;
      images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults 18 85 years old who have been diagnosed with liver cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have routine blood tests, physical exams, and x-rays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with blood tests, physical exam, and medical history. They will&#xD;
      have a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis. This will include a contrast&#xD;
      drink and a contrast (dye) injected in the veins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be admitted to the clinic. They will repeat the screening tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have other tests. These may include x-rays, other scans, or ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be evaluated for general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will get counseling about the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get anesthesia. The LC LUMI beads will be injected into blood vessels. The&#xD;
      beads contain iodine, which makes them visible by x-ray and by a CT scan machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have follow-up visits for 12 months. They will have CT scans and/or other&#xD;
      radiologic tests.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is the 3rd most common cause of cancer globally with an&#xD;
      increasing incidence worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of hepatic malignancies from primary Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) or metastatic&#xD;
      disease involves a multidisciplinary approach of surgery and chemotherapy and in the case of&#xD;
      HCC, transplant, anti-VEGF sorafenib, or local or regional image guided therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thermal ablation (RFA or MWA) and transarterial embolization (TAE) are minimally invasive&#xD;
      image guided local or regional therapies that have been extensively studied for decades, and&#xD;
      more recently and to a lesser extent have been studied together as a combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LC Bead LUM^TM, a radiopaque embolic bead product (company code BTG 13-002), is an imageable&#xD;
      spherical embolic product that can be visualised by X-ray based imaging (e.g., fluoroscopy&#xD;
      and CT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The beads are non-resorbable microspheres with calibrated size ranges that occlude arteries&#xD;
      for the purpose of blocking the blood flow to a target tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LC Bead LUMITM are intended to be used for the embolization of hypervascular tumors and&#xD;
      arteriovenous malformations (AVMs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the imaging characteristics of radiopaque beads including qualitatively&#xD;
      comparing virtual and actual bead perfusion in the treatment of hepatic tumors using bead&#xD;
      embolization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment eligibility for TAE requires agreement between the Interventional Radiologist&#xD;
      reviewing imaging and feasibility of TAE and the patient's NIH primary treatment team who&#xD;
      will evaluate the patient's clinical parameters to undergo anesthesia and the TAE and or&#xD;
      ablation procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least &gt;=18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with pathologically proven, hepatic-dominant neoplasm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The extent of hepatic metastases is &lt;50% of total hepatic volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Past treatment with Y90 must be 6 months from TAE treatment and liver function within NIH&#xD;
      institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECOG performance status &lt;=2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must have normal organ and marrow function per laboratory parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with minor allergies to iodine will also be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Participants: 30&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Time Frame: approximately 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of Study: Feasibility study&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study to assess the characteristics of radio-opaque bland beads during TAE in&#xD;
      the treatment of hepatic malignancies. Patients may also receive thermal ablation treatment&#xD;
      in conjunction with TAE if clinically indicated, although comparison of bead treatment with&#xD;
      or without thermal ablation is not part of the study s aim.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare virtual and actual perfusion characteristics of the LUMI radiopaque beads with&#xD;
      CBCT and/or CT. Patients scans will be obtained per TAE standard of care schedule. Other&#xD;
      imaging evaluation of this therapy may be performed at regular intervals following completion&#xD;
      of treatment, and will be governed by standard conventional imaging regimen post treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The choice of which combination of imaging (CT, Cone beam CT (CBCT), or fluoroscopy) and when&#xD;
      to image, will be made by the clinical care team for the patient, based upon&#xD;
      multidisciplinary recommendations and NIH Clinical Center customary use and standard of care,&#xD;
      and will be purely clinical decisions (not research-related).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will have a diagnosed hepatic malignancy, and be eligible to undergo&#xD;
      transarterial embolization and thermal ablation under general anesthesia. The LC LUMI bead&#xD;
      will be used in the transarterial embolization procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up will continue for 12 months from the time of initial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated in multidisciplinary GI medical oncology clinic and up to 30&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled to accrue 20 evaluable patients.&#xD;
