  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate if MRI scans performed after neoadjuvant&#xD;
      radiotherapy can predict the therapeutic response of rectal cancer following preoperative&#xD;
      chemo-radiotherapy. This will help doctors to better tailor treatments for rectal cancer in&#xD;
      the future.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We proposed to constructed multi-parameter predictive model for predicting therapeutic&#xD;
      response and pathological complete response(pCR) of patients with rectal cancer who received&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemoradiation. MR radiomics,convolutional neural networks, morphological&#xD;
      parameters and quantitative functional parameters derived from diffusion-weighted MR images&#xD;
      will be integrated for model construction.&#xD;
