      This pilot trial studies how well nanoparticle albumin-bound rapamycin works in treating&#xD;
      patients with cancer that as has spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be&#xD;
      cured or controlled with treatment (advanced cancer) and that has an abnormality in a protein&#xD;
      called mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). Patients with this mutation are identified by&#xD;
      genetic testing. Patients then receive nanoparticle albumin-bound rapamycin, which may stop&#xD;
      the growth of cancer cells by blocking the mTOR enzyme, which is needed for cell growth and&#xD;
      multiplication. Using treatments that target a patient's specific mutation may be a more&#xD;
      effective treatment than the standard of care treatment.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To investigate efficacy of groups of patients defined by disease type, genomic aberration&#xD;
      and treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the confirmed response rate of nanoparticle albumin-bound rapamycin&#xD;
      (nab-rapamycin) in mTOR aberrant advanced cancers. (Sub-protocol Arm A)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate other clinical outcomes (e.g., progression-free and overall survival) of&#xD;
      groups of patients defined by disease type, genomic aberration and treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe the adverse event profile of each regimen. III. To assess the clinical&#xD;
      benefit rate of nab-rapamycin in mTOR aberrant advanced cancers. (Sub-protocol Arm A).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To estimate progression-free survival (specifically at 6 months) and overall survival of&#xD;
      these patients. (Sub-protocol Arm A) V. To estimate the adverse event profile of&#xD;
      nab-rapamycin. (Sub-protocol Arm A)&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe patient health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and symptoms using the European&#xD;
      Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core&#xD;
      (QLQ-C)30 in groups of patients defined by disease type and/or treatment regimen and to&#xD;
      correlative HRQOL/symptoms with genomic markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the rate of individual mTOR pathway aberrations and assess the association&#xD;
      between individual mTOR pathway aberrations and clinical outcome both across disease&#xD;
      indications and within disease indications. (Sub-protocol Arm A)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive nanoparticle albumin-bound rapamycin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on&#xD;
      days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 24 weeks in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Ability to provide informed written consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to return to enrolling institution for follow-up (active monitoring phase of&#xD;
             the study); Note: During the active monitoring phase of a study (i.e., active&#xD;
             treatment), participants must be willing to return to the consenting institution for&#xD;
             follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;

             part of routine clinical care and treatment recommendation by the Mayo Clinic Genomics&#xD;
             Tumor Board (GTB); NOTE: If profile matches more than 1 treatment arm, final decision&#xD;
             for treatment arm assignment to be made by patients treating physician; it will be&#xD;
             required for the genomic aberration to be identified through a test in a Clinical&#xD;
             Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) workflow; assays used will range from single&#xD;

             growth factor receptor 2 [ERBB2] amplifications) to next generation sequencing based&#xD;
             gene panels (Foundation One®) to more comprehensive assays such as whole exome&#xD;
             sequencing; the Mayo Clinic GTB will serve as the centralized point of data synthesis&#xD;

             sequencing from archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (FFPE) are validated&#xD;
             with sensitivities and specificities of 99% and 99%, respectively; in the assay,&#xD;
             hybrid-capture-selected deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) libraries are sequenced to depths&#xD;
