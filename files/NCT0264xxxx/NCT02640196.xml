    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesized that the use of the King Vision™ and the Airtraq® VL would&#xD;
      reduce the time to DLT intubation compared with the GlideScope® and Macintosh in simulated&#xD;
      easy and difficult airways. The investigators have considered to assess the efficacy of each&#xD;
      device in manikins before considering to evaluate them in patients undergoing thoracic&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-one staff anaesthesiologists who had limited prior experience in using the VLs for DLT&#xD;
      intubation participated in this randomised crossover study. Following a brief demonstration&#xD;
      and two practice attempts, participants were volunteered to insert a DLT using the Macintosh,&#xD;
      GlideScope®, Airtraq®, and King Vision™ on two high-fidelity easy and difficult airway&#xD;
      simulators in a computer-generated randomized sequence. The primary endpoint, time to DLT&#xD;
      intubation, as well as, the views obtained at laryngoscopy, ease of intubation, numbers of&#xD;
      laryngoscopy attempts and optimisation manoeuvers, and failure to intubation; defined as an&#xD;
      attempt took longer than 150 seconds, were recorded.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several regional surveys demonstrated that most thoracic anesthesiologists are using the&#xD;
      double-lumen endobronchial tubes (DLT) as the first-choice lung separation technique. DLT,&#xD;
      when compared with single lumen tracheal tube, can be more difficult to insert in patients&#xD;
      with difficult airways. The videolaryngoscopes (VL) have the potential to facilitate the&#xD;
      placement of the DLTs for lung separation in patients with predicted or unanticipated&#xD;
      difficult airway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of GlideScope® (Verathon Inc., Bothell, WA, USA), a VL with an angulated blade, has&#xD;
      been associated with variable times to DLT intubation according to the prior experience of&#xD;
      the operators, despite superior visualization of the glottis The channeled Airtraq® (Prodol&#xD;
      Meditec S.A., Vizcaya, Spain) and standard non-channeled blade of the King Vision™ (Ambu,&#xD;
      Ballerup, Copenhagen, Denmark), may offer additional benefits for DLT intubation in patients&#xD;
      with limited mouth opening or restricted neck movement, in whom the use of traditional VL&#xD;
      like as the Glidescope® could be difficult. This is because of the larger outer diameter, the&#xD;
      distal curvature and the increased rigidity of the DLT. Of note, the longer times to DLT&#xD;
      intubation with the use of different VL could be shortened with building up the operator's&#xD;
      experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of the investigators knowledge, the comparison of the effects of the Macintosh,&#xD;
      GlideScope®, Airtraq®, and King Vision™ VL on the time to DLT intubation in simulated easy&#xD;
      and difficult airways has not yet been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two high-fidelity simulators (Airway Management Trainer, model AA-3100, Laerdal, Kent, UK)&#xD;
      were prepared to simulate easy and difficult airway situations, as described by Marshall et&#xD;
      al. and Wang et al. The &quot;easy&quot; airway was established with the manikin in a neutral position.&#xD;
      The &quot;difficult&quot; airway setting was obtained by placing an Oasis Elite™ Prone Head Rest, Adult&#xD;
      (140 mm in height) (Covidien, Mansfield, MA) under the occiput and securing the head position&#xD;
      with adhesive tape, object to replicate cervical-collar use. Positioning was confirmed after&#xD;
      each attempt to ensure consistency.&#xD;
