      BACKGROUND: Chagas Disease (ChD) remains as one of the most neglected diseases in the world,&#xD;
      with 8-10 million infected people and only one marginally effective therapeutic. The lack of&#xD;
      good biomarkers for active infection or clinical end-points poses a problem for assessing the&#xD;
      performance of new drugs or therapeutic interventions. Among the biomarkers, several studies&#xD;
      showed that Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NT-ProBNP) is accurate maker of left ventricular&#xD;
      systolic and diastolic dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE: Our long term goal is to establish The Sao Paulo-Minas Gerais Tropical Medicine&#xD;
      Research Center (SaMi-Trop) as a Center of Excellence for Neglected Infectious Disease&#xD;
      Research in Brazil. The Specific Aims are to begin that process by focusing on Trypanosoma&#xD;
      cruzi infection with the goal of finding an array of biomarkers that correlate with parasite&#xD;
      persistence and Chagas cardiac disease status that can be used to infer risk of disease&#xD;
      progression and death as well used as markers of cure (parasite eradication) or clinical&#xD;
      efficacy (stabilize or reverse cardiac damage) of novel drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD: The investigators established a prospective cohort of 1,959 patients with chronic&#xD;
      Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC). The study is being conducted in 21 cities of the northern part&#xD;
      of Minas Gerais state in Brazil, and includes a follow up of at least two years (baseline and&#xD;
      24 months) . The evaluation included collection of socio-demographic information, social&#xD;
      determinants of health, health-related behaviours, comorbidities, medicines in use, history&#xD;
      of previous treatment for Chagas Disease (ChD), symptoms, functional class, quality of life,&#xD;
      blood sample collection and ECG.&#xD;

      RESEARCH STRATEGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIGNIFICANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sao Paulo-Minas Gerais Tropical Medicine Research Center (SaMi-Trop) consists of a&#xD;
      network of collaborating scientists in the States of Minas Gerais and São Paulo which has&#xD;
      been established for the purpose of developing and conducting research projects on neglected&#xD;
      infectious diseases in Brazil, with an initial focus on Chagas Disease biomarker, discovery&#xD;
      and validation. The SaMi-Trop represents a major challenge for focused research in neglected&#xD;
      diseases, with knowledge that can be applied in primary health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic Chagas Cardiomyopathy (CCC) is the most important clinical presentation of Chagas&#xD;
      Disease (ChD), eventually affecting approximately 20% to 30% of those in the chronic phase of&#xD;
      the disease. CCC comprises a wide range of manifestations, including heart failure,&#xD;
      arrhythmias, heart-blocks, sudden death, thromboembolism and stroke [1]. Clinical&#xD;
      presentation typically varies widely according to the degree of myocardial damage and most&#xD;
      patients present a mild form of heart disease, frequently characterized only by the presence&#xD;
      of asymptomatic abnormalities on the ECG or in other complimentary exams [2]. Nonetheless,&#xD;
      when heart failure and/or severe arrhythmias manifest, the prognosis is ominous, with high&#xD;
      and premature mortality rates, typically in adult male patients,1 but also in the elderly&#xD;
      [3]. Indeed, when compared to patients with idiopathic cardiomyopathy, patients with CCC have&#xD;
      poorer survival, irrespective of other clinical and echocardiographic parameters [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the clinical course of Chagas heart disease is variable and identifying patients who&#xD;
      are at risk of progressive CCC and dying remains a challenge. Several longitudinal studies&#xD;
      performed in patients in the chronic phase of ChD demonstrated that many individual&#xD;
      characteristics predict an unfavorable prognosis. This subject was systematically reviewed a&#xD;
      few years ago and concluded that most studies were described in insufficient detail and/or&#xD;
      lacked minimal standards in reporting results. Results have been somewhat inconsistent in&#xD;
      different studies, and the best combination of clinical and laboratory variables predictive&#xD;
      of mortality has not yet been established [5].&#xD;
&#xD;
      A potentially helpful score to predict death was developed to permit the stratification of&#xD;
      risk in Chagas heart disease [6]. Six independent prognostic factors were identified, and&#xD;
      each was assigned a number of points: New York Heart Association class III or IV (5 points),&#xD;
      evidence of cardiomegaly on radiography (5 points), left ventricular systolic dysfunction on&#xD;
      echocardiography (3 points), non-sustained ventricular tachycardia on 24-hour Holter&#xD;
      monitoring or stress testing (3 points), low QRS voltage on electrocardiography (2 points),&#xD;
      and male sex (2 points) [6. Patients were classified in three risk groups according to the&#xD;
      final score: low risk (0 to 6 points), intermediate risk (7 to 11 points), and high risk (12&#xD;
      to 20 points). In the original study, the 5-year mortality rates for these three groups were&#xD;
      2 percent, 18 percent, and 63 percent, respectively.6 Although the score was successfully&#xD;
      validated in independent cohorts, [6,7] some important issues may arise. The derivation of&#xD;
      the score is complex and it is not easy to calculate during the medical consultation. To be&#xD;
      calculated, the patient must be submitted to several exams and procedures, including clinical&#xD;
      examination, ECG, Chest x-ray, echocardiogram and Holter monitoring or stress testing. Most&#xD;
      of these tests are not available in the rural areas, where most of ChD patients live.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A simple score, based on widely available and low-cost tests, which could stratify the risk&#xD;
      of death without complex calculations, might be useful in the primary care setting, where&#xD;
      echocardiograms and Holter monitoring are not widely available. Easily obtained variables,&#xD;
      such as clinical features, BNP levels and ECG measurements, are good candidates as biomarkers&#xD;
      for developing a new simple predictive rule. Moreover, new biomarkers in blood, related&#xD;
      mainly to inflammation and the immune response, such as TNF-alpha, adhesion molecules and&#xD;
      other cytokines, may be determined to be potent prognostic factors and may be useful in the&#xD;
      future for further improvement in risk stratification in CCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-concurrent prospective open cohort study, with minimal follow-up of two years (baseline&#xD;
      and 24 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: death Secondary: hospitalization due to cardiac conditions; new ECG abnormalities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be selected from patients evaluated by the Tele Minas Saude (TMS), the&#xD;
      state Tele Health System. Since the TeleHealth System is currently acting in support of the&#xD;
      Primary Care system, these patients are under the care of primary care physicians of the&#xD;
      Health Family Strategy, a public primary care program that has a high coverage in the state&#xD;
      of Minas Gerais.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria are to be a client of the TMS TeleHealth System, be &gt;18 years old,&#xD;
      have a positive history for T cruzi infection or Chagas disease, have an abnormal ECG and to&#xD;
      consent to participating in the research program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria include pregnancy or breast feeding, and any severe condition with&#xD;
      ominous prognosis that indicates a life expectancy of less than two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size for patient accrual&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the minimal number of events per variable acceptable in a proportional hazards&#xD;
      regression analysis of 10 events per variable,8 and maximal number of studied variables of&#xD;
      ten, the number of events would be 100 in the whole study. Since the prediction model has to&#xD;
      be developed and validated and the whole sample will be divided in two, the number of events&#xD;
      should be 200. For a 2-year follow-up period and annual mortality rate of 5% in CCC (10% in 2&#xD;
      years), the calculated sample size is 2,000 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the TMS Telehealth system performs 25,000 ECGs each month (300,000 a year), that ECG&#xD;
      abnormalities typical of CCC are observed in 5% of these exams (1,250), and projecting that&#xD;
      10% of these patients would be recruited and agree to participate in this research program,&#xD;
      the calculated sample size of 2,000 patients will be recruited in a 16 months' accrual&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up will be conducted on a yearly basis, with standardized interviews and new ECG exams&#xD;
      performed after two years of baseline. Vital status and hospitalization will also be&#xD;
      ascertained by linkage of the study database with mortality and hospitalization databases of&#xD;
      the Ministry of Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment, initial evaluation and measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from among those that regularly attend the public primary care&#xD;
      service of State of Minas Gerais in places served by TMS Telehealth System. This system&#xD;
      provides teleconsultation and Electrocardiogram services (TeleECG), including interpretation&#xD;
      of all ECGs by a cardiologist in the University Hospital. A standardized simple form is&#xD;
      completed before the transmission of the ECG data to the University hospital and the question&#xD;
      &quot;Do you know if you have Chagas disease?&quot; will be added to this questionnaire. Those who&#xD;
      answer yes to this question and have abnormal ECG will be selected. A second visit of the&#xD;
      selected patients will be scheduled for performing a short questionnaire (including the&#xD;
      evaluation of the functional class) and for collecting blood samples. Blood samples will be&#xD;
      sent to a central laboratory for T. cruzi serology and BNP measurements, which will be done&#xD;
      by standard techniques. Other blood samples, including plasma for protein and antibody&#xD;
      studies and stabilized whole blood lysates for T cruzi PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction), DNA,&#xD;
      will be stored at -80o C to enable batched testing for other biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrocardiogram services (TeleECG)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ECG performed in the town of origin of the patients will be sent to be assessed by the&#xD;
      TMS Telehealth System specialists. The Telecardiology activities were developed using a&#xD;
      digital electrocardiograph installed in the towns, at the Basic Health Units of the public&#xD;
      healthcare system. The examination was always carried out after being requested by a&#xD;
      physician. The ECG will be sent using communication software developed by the TMS Telehealth&#xD;
      System and will be analyzed by a on-duty cardiologist. The report will be sent to the Primary&#xD;
      Care facility and the ECG tracings will be transferred to ECG reading center. In this ECG&#xD;
      Reading Center, a software developed by Prof. Peter Mac Farlane, from Glasgow University,&#xD;
      will analyzes and codify the ECG (by the Minnesota Code) and compare to the previous ECG,&#xD;
      according to a validated algorithm [9]. All abnormal codes will be reviewed by an experienced&#xD;
      cardiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) analysis and a survival analysis will be conducted.&#xD;
      The outcome death is death. Also, a survival analysis considering the secondary outcomes -&#xD;
      hospitalization due to cardiac conditions and new ECG abnormalities - will be run. The&#xD;
      development and validation of the prognostic model will follow current recommendations,&#xD;
      including the division of the sample in derivation and validation sample, and the use of&#xD;
      modern methods to evaluate the performance of the model [10,11]. Additionally, descriptive&#xD;
      spatial analysis using geographic distribution for the SMR and a Bayesian spatial model for&#xD;
      small area data will be run.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beyond the relevance of the main goal of this study, it has many unique and innovative&#xD;
      aspects, related to the use of knowledge and infra-structure developed for other projects&#xD;
      conducted by our research group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The possibility of testing new biomarkers detected in other branches of this study or in&#xD;
           the NIH-sponsored REDS-II/III Chagas disease study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The use of the infrastructure and the logistics of the TMS program, a state-wide&#xD;
           TeleHealth System coordinated by the University Hospital in the Brazilian state of Minas&#xD;
           Gerais&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The use of the methodology of linkage between our databases and administrative and&#xD;
           mortality databases from the Health Ministry to complement the follow-up of the selected&#xD;
           patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A standardized codification system of the ECGs, using the facilities of the ECG Reading&#xD;
           Center of the long-term longitudinal study on the health of 15,000 adult public servants&#xD;
           from Brazilian Universities (ELSA-Brazil).&#xD;
&#xD;
      New biomarkers ChD has a complex physiopathology and many immunological, inflammatory,&#xD;
      autonomic and micro-vascular processes have a role in the development or the progression of&#xD;
      the disease [12]. The investigators have described increased levels of macrophage&#xD;
      inflammatory protein (MIP-1alpha) and Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in ChD&#xD;
      patients, [13-15] and that those patients with more severe forms have more elevated levels&#xD;
      [13]. Recently, in the ChD study (REDS-II), were studied 600 ChD patients and 500 controls&#xD;
      searching for biomarkers related to the disease and CCC. In a preliminary analysis, several&#xD;
      biomarkers including high sensitivity troponin, myoglobin, soluble vascular cell adhesion&#xD;
      molecule 1 (sVCAM-1), soluble intracellular cell adhesion molecule (sICAM) and&#xD;
      myeloperoxidase showed abnormal patterns in T cruzi seropositive and parasitemic donors and&#xD;
      CCC patients. These and other biomarkers, including those identified in the transcriptome&#xD;
      analysis are candidates to be studied in the whole cohort of 2,000 CCC patients in TMS&#xD;
      program or, alternatively, using nested case-control design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tele Minas Saude (TMS) Program, a state-wide public TeleHealth System&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TMS program is a partnership between the Minas Gerais State Health Department and the&#xD;
      State Research Agency (FAPEMIG) with six public universities of Minas Gerais: Universidade&#xD;
      Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG), Universidade Federal do Triângulo Mineiro (UFTM),&#xD;
      Universidade Estadual de Montes Claros (UNIMONTES), Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora&#xD;
      (UFJF), Universidade Federal de São João del-Rei (UFSJ) and Universidade Federal de&#xD;
      Uberlândia (UFU), forming the Teleassistance Network of Minas Gerais. Created from a&#xD;
      telehealth pilot project in cardiology (2006), later expanded to other specialties and&#xD;
      villages and transformed into permanent telehealth service, subsidized by the state&#xD;
      government in 2009 [16-18].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to support infrastructure projects of state public health, initially&#xD;
      deployed to support the Primary Health Care and Family Health Teams [16]. At that stage, had&#xD;
      as main objective to assist professionals in their daily work to improve access to&#xD;
      specialized services, reducing and qualifying referrals of patients to secondary and tertiary&#xD;
      care. The main activities offered are a) duty of teleconsultation offline in various medical&#xD;
      specialties, nursing, dentistry, physiotherapy, psychology, pharmacy and nutrition, b) duty&#xD;
      in telecardiology to analyze electrocardiograms (ECGs) and provide teleconsultations online&#xD;
      for critical clinical cases c) technical support online and offline, d) permanent education&#xD;
      through workshops and training and e) continuous monitoring of system operation in the&#xD;
      municipalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, the program was implemented in 608 municipalities in the state corresponding to 732&#xD;
      telehealth sites. The primary care units in the villages were equipped with computers,&#xD;
      electrocardiograph, digital printer and digital camera. Universities were equipped with&#xD;
      workstations and videoconferencing equipment. Since 2006, over 20,000 teleconsultations were&#xD;
      conducted and 600,000 ECGs analyzed by experts. These telehealth activities prevented the&#xD;
      displacement of patients in 78% of the cases [16].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Linkage of databases The Brazilian Health System is characterized by coexistence of a&#xD;
      universal public health system (70-80% of coverage) and a supplementary private network.&#xD;
      Mortality data from all Brazilians and from hospitalizations in the public health system are&#xD;
      stored in large databases owned and managed by the Health Ministry. Investigators developed a&#xD;
      methodology for searching these databases for specific subjects using probabilistic linkage&#xD;
      methods. The probabilistic strategy we developed has high accuracy, with a sensitivity of&#xD;
      90.6% and specificity 100% [19]. This method will be used in a complimentary way to direct&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECG Reading Center ECG interpretation is subjected to substantial intra- and inter-observer&#xD;
      variability. To overcome this problem, a standardized ECG code was developed 50 years ago 20&#xD;
      and has been widely used in epidemiological studies. The visual classification of the ECG&#xD;
      using the Minnesota code, nonetheless, is time consuming. The investigators created a ECG&#xD;
      Reading Center for the Elsa study, a 10-year longitudinal cohort study of 15,000 public&#xD;
      employees of Brazilian Universities. For this ECG Reading Center, was installed a software&#xD;
      developed by Prof. Peter MacFarlane, from Glasgow University, that analyzes, codifies and&#xD;
      compares the ECG with previous tracings, according to a validated algorithm [9]. This system&#xD;
      will be used in the present project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary Studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic and prognostic value of BNP In 2002, investigators described, in a study published&#xD;
      by The Lancet, that blood levels of BNP are inversely correlated to the systolic left&#xD;
      ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, the most used index of LV function in ChD [21]. In&#xD;
      patients with abnormal ECG and/or chest X-Ray, BNP elevation had a positive predictive value&#xD;
      of 80% and a negative predictive value of 97% for the detection of patients with depressed&#xD;
      left ventricular ejection fraction [21]. This results were confirmed in the following years&#xD;
      by several other studies by our research group [22-26]. A diagnostic strategy including ECG&#xD;
      and BNP performed better than the classical approach with ECG and chest X-Ray [24]. Moreover,&#xD;
      BNP was also a marker of ventricular arrhythmia [26] and diastolic dysfunction [22,27].&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, was described that BNP levels were strong predictors of the risk of death [28]&#xD;
      and in a cohort of 1,398 indwelling elderly from the city of Bambuí, in the state of Minas&#xD;
      Gerais, Brazil [28]. The hazard ratio for death was 1.27 for each unit of log-transformed BNP&#xD;
      level (95% confidence interval (CI: 1.11, 1.45) among infected persons, independent of&#xD;
      potentially confounding factors. Infected persons with baseline BNP levels in the top&#xD;
      quartile had a risk of death twice that of persons in the bottom quartile (hazard ratio =&#xD;
      2.07, 95% CI: 1.29, 3.32). In the same population, was found that BNP alone or in association&#xD;
      with atrial fibrillation had prognostic value for stroke mortality in T. cruzi chronically&#xD;
      infected older adults [29].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrocardiographic measures and prognostic models The ECG is the single most important exam&#xD;
      in CCC. Numerous epidemiological studies have shown that patients with a normal ECG have an&#xD;
      excellent medium-term survival [30,31]. The greater the number and severity of ECG&#xD;
      alterations registered in a same tracing, the more advanced the myocardial damage possibly&#xD;
      is, and the worse the prognosis should be [12]. We have shown that the QRS duration is&#xD;
      moderately correlated with the LV ejection fraction [32] and that, during the follow-up of&#xD;
      these patients, the increase in the duration of the QRS complex and the appearance of new&#xD;
      electrocardiographic alterations may help in identifying patients with a significant decrease&#xD;
      (of 5% or more) in left ventricle ejection fraction [33].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based in the well-known prognostic value of LV ejection fraction and the presence of&#xD;
      ventricular tachycardia, [5] was proposed an alternative approach to the well established&#xD;
      Rassi's score, [34,35] considering only three risk factors: left ventricular ejection&#xD;
      fraction &lt; 50%, ventricular tachycardia at either stress testing or Holter monitoring, and&#xD;
      QRS &gt; 133 ms at ECG (or filtered QRS &gt; 150 ms at signal-averaged ECG).34,35 Low risk group&#xD;
      has zero or one risk factor (5-year mortality: 1%), intermediate risk, two factors (20%&#xD;
      mortality), and high risk, all three factors (50% mortality). This simplified prognostic&#xD;
      score had an excellent performance in predicting death in a study with 74 months of follow up&#xD;
      (c statistic 0.92) and it may be an attractive alternative to the established six-factor&#xD;
      score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, the investigators showed that T-wave amplitude variability (TWV), a&#xD;
      sophisticated ECG-derived measure of repolarization variability, is independently related to&#xD;
      the risk of death in ChD [36]. They have also studied the prognostic value of several new&#xD;
      echocardiographic measures [37-39] which could be of physiopathological and clinical&#xD;
      relevance, but are not possible to be used for ambulatory patients in the rural area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrating mortality in Chagas disease patients Classified according&#xD;
      to the presence prolonged of QRS &gt; 133 ms at ECG; Classified according to a risk score in&#xD;
      which each of the following factors is worth one point: ventricular tachycardia at either&#xD;
      stress testing or Holter monitoring, left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 0.50, QRS &gt; 133 ms&#xD;
      at ECG. Low risk group has zero or one risk factors, intermediate risk, two factors, and high&#xD;
      risk, all three factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summarizing, although we and others investigators have extensively studied prognostic markers&#xD;
      in Chagas disease and CCC, there is no definite simple, low-cost prognostic model available&#xD;
      to be used in the primary care setting. Standard ECG and BNP levels are good candidates to be&#xD;
      selected in this simplified predictive model.&#xD;

    <description>We have established a prospective cohort of 1,959 patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC) to evaluate if a clinical prediction rule based on electrocardiogram (ECG), Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) levels and other biomarkers can be useful in clinical practice.&#xD;
The study is being conducted in 21 cities of the northern part of Minas Gerais state in Brazil, and includes a follow up of at least two years. The baseline evaluation included collection of socio-demographic information, social determinants of health, health-related behaviours, comorbidities, medicines in use, history of previous treatment for Chagas Disease (ChD), symptoms, functional class, quality of life, blood sample collection and ECG.</description>

        Patients will be selected based on the ECG results performed in 2011-12 by the Telehealth&#xD;
        Network. Since the TeleHealth System is currently acting in support of the Primary Care&#xD;
        system, these patients are under the care of primary care physicians of the Health Family&#xD;
        Strategy, a public primary care program that has a high coverage in the state of Minas&#xD;
        Gerais.&#xD;
