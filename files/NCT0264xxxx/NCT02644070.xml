    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the present multicenter randomized controlled trial was to evaluate and&#xD;
      compare the shortterm clinical and histological changes of extraction sockets after ridge&#xD;
      preservation procedures with changes of extraction sockets that healed naturally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim was to evaluate which, if any extraction socket characteristics could have&#xD;
      affected tissue changes occurring at the augmented as well as naturally healed sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and enrollment of patients were performed from June 2011 to June 2012 in five&#xD;
      university centers/private practice:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  University of Pisa;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  University of Murcia;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  University of Ancona;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Private practice, Dr. Di Felice;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  University of Verona.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. extraction sockets with spontaneous healing;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. extraction sockets grafted with pre-hydrated collagenated cortico-cancellous porcine&#xD;
           bone, with a particle size between 600 and 1000 μm;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. extraction sockets grafted with cortical porcine bone, with a particle size between 600&#xD;
           and 1000 μm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Variables&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes of ridge volume contour;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vertical bone changes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Buccal-Lingual Width;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histomorphometric parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was calculated comparing outcome data between grafted sockets versus non-grafted&#xD;
      sockets. The primary parameter was the change in mid-buccal vertical height (0.7±1.4mm and&#xD;
      3.6±1.5mm, respectively, for the test and control groups) (Barone et al. 2008). Final sample&#xD;
      size was increased to 30 subjects per group due to possible patient dropout events. Each&#xD;
      center contributed according to the predetermined 1:1:1 ratio; the fresh extraction socket&#xD;
      was considered the unit of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corrections for balancing the three experimental groups for confounding factors were not&#xD;
      applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A matrix elaborator performed all the analyses§§: multi-way analysis of variance (ANOVAn) was&#xD;
      applied, then appropriate post hoc comparison tests were run; post hoc estimated effect sizes&#xD;
      were calculated with a power of 0.9. The level of statistical significance was set at 0.05&#xD;
      for all analyses.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following tooth extraction, the alveolar ridge undergoes a marked change. During the first&#xD;
      year after tooth extraction, about 50% of the bucco-lingual ridge dimension will be lost.&#xD;
      Furthermore, ridge reduction will become more pronounced from a buccal than from a&#xD;
      lingual/palatal aspect. The hard tissue modelling and remodelling following tooth extraction&#xD;
      were studied in the dog model. It was demonstrated that the socket was first occupied by a&#xD;
      coagulum that was replaced with granulation tissue, provisional connective tissue and woven&#xD;
      bone. This immature hard tissue was subsequently replaced with lamellar bone and bone marrow.&#xD;
      During the healing phase, the height of the buccal bone wall was substantially reduced. In&#xD;
      addition, about 30% of the marginal portion of the alveolar process of the extraction site&#xD;
      was lost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several approaches have been tested to preserve or improve the dimension and contour of the&#xD;
      ridge following tooth extraction including the use of various graft or filler materials such&#xD;
      as autografts, allografts, xenografts and/ or barrier membranes. The most recent studies on&#xD;
      animals as well as in humans showed that the placement of xenografts in fresh extraction&#xD;
      sockets promoted de novo hard tissue formation, in particular in the marginal portion of the&#xD;
      extraction site. Moreover, it should be considered that the dimension of hard tissue walls&#xD;
      was maintained and the profile of the ridge preserved. The data concerning socket&#xD;
      preservation techniques in humans are still scarce. Therefore, firm conclusions about&#xD;
      dimensional changes cannot be drawn currently; in reality, socket preservation procedures may&#xD;
      aid in reducing the bone dimensional changes following tooth extraction. However, they do not&#xD;
      completely prevent bone resorption so that a loss in width and height may be still expected;&#xD;
      even if this procedure can allows a better location for implant placement and minimize the&#xD;
      need for GBR procedure simultaneously with implant placement when compared to natural healed&#xD;
      sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The histologic and histomorphometric evaluations showed the early phase of hard tissue&#xD;
      formation were altered in extraction sockets that were grafted with a deproteinized bovine&#xD;
      bone mineral immediately after tooth removal. The authors suggested that this modified wound&#xD;
      healing and bone modelling may have been influenced by the presence of multinucleated cells&#xD;
      that occurred in tissues harbouring the xenogenic graft. Thus, in grafted sites, substantial&#xD;
      amount of newly formed bone could only be detected in the apical portion of the sockets where&#xD;
      the graft material was absent. In the remaining portions of the grafted sockets a mildly&#xD;
      inflamed provisional matrix surrounded the majority of bovine bone mineral particles, whose&#xD;
      surface was frequently, but not always, coated with multinucleated cells. The biological&#xD;
      behaviour can be explained with the type of biomaterial which is not resorbable/or slowly&#xD;
      resorbable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given these premises, this prospective, randomized-controlled multicenter clinical study will&#xD;
      compare the dimensional healing pattern, the quality of de novo bone formation and the&#xD;
      implant placement in large tooth extraction sites after grafting with two types of&#xD;
      xenografts: MP3 vs. Apatos by Tecnoss- Osteobiol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To augment fresh premolar and molar extraction sites with MP3 and Apatos;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate dimensional ridge changes with MP3 and Apatos ( clinical measurements and&#xD;
           volumetric evaluations with a computerized analysis of study casts);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To place implants (BT EVO, Biotec, Povolaro, Italy) 3 months after grafting ( diameter,&#xD;
           length, need for additional GBR procedures);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the histological aspects of bone biopsies taken at the osteotomy preparation&#xD;
           sites;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To follow and to monitor the implant success in treated sites for up to 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study tested as first outcome the null hypothesis that there were no differences&#xD;
      between the 2 biomaterials against the alternative hypothesis of a difference;&#xD;
&#xD;
      - second long-term outcome performance of implants placed in grafted sites. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis The sample size was calculated for the primary outcome measures (implant&#xD;
      failure); it was decided to recruit 30 patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis was performed with descriptive statistics and independent sample t-test was&#xD;
      used for comparison of mean values between groups to evaluate the significant differences&#xD;
      between the two treatment groups. The Pearson Chi Square test was used to test for&#xD;
      relationships between variables. A p value &lt;0.05 was selected as the level of statistical&#xD;
      significance. The estimation of the implant survival rate was based on Kaplan-Meier analysis.&#xD;
      Cumulative implant survival over time was assessed using the Kaplan-Meyer analysis. The&#xD;
      cumulative survival rate (CSR) is the probability that the implant will survive at least to a&#xD;
      stated time within the observation period of the investigation. The failure time for each&#xD;
      implant was defined as the elapsed time from placement to the date of failure. In cases where&#xD;
      the terminal event was not reached, the elapsed time between implant insertion and last visit&#xD;
      was assumed as the survival time. All evaluations were performed using SPSS software version&#xD;
      6.1.2 for Windows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 Pre-surgical assessment Patients will be seen for evaluation and enrolment. Upon&#xD;
      enrolment an informed consent form will be signed by the patient prior to enrolment in the&#xD;
      study after which a patient study number will be assigned. Documentation of demographic,&#xD;
      medical and dental conditions and pre-operative site conditions will be recorded on a&#xD;
      specific case report form. Impressions will be taken to obtain an individualized template&#xD;
      which will be used for clinical measurements after tooth extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VISIT 2 Tooth Extraction and Grafting Procedure All surgeries have to be performed with the&#xD;
      same technique by calibrated clinicians. After dental extraction, the resulting sockets will&#xD;
      be debrided and clinical measurements evaluated. The number of extracted tooth will be&#xD;
      recorded on a specific case report form. Impressions will be taken to obtain study casts to&#xD;
      evaluate volumetric changes of the extraction socket site with the use of a computerized&#xD;
      software system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At completion of tooth extraction efforts, the patient's randomization card will be unmasked&#xD;
      to reveal the treatment group assignment for each extraction site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purpose of this study it will be necessary to ensure the removal of all remaining&#xD;
      root fragments, fibers and soft tissue from the sockets prior to placement of graft material.&#xD;
      Either curettes and/or burs may be used for degranulation of extraction sockets. The&#xD;
      following extraction procedure observations will be documented: methods used for tooth&#xD;
      removal, need for curettage of extraction site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each alveolar socket will be classified according the following classification in addition [&#xD;
      Joudzbalys et al. 2008 and 2010].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type Classification Type I Socket The facial soft tissue an buccal plate of bone are at&#xD;
      normal levels in relation to the cementoenamel junction of the pre-extracted tooth and remain&#xD;
      intact postextraction Type II Socket Facial soft tissue is present but the buccal plate is&#xD;
      partially missing following extraction of the tooth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type III Socket The facial soft tissue and the buccal plate of bone are both markedly reduced&#xD;
      after tooth extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grafting material will handled according to manufacturer's recommendations and each&#xD;
      extraction site will receive the graft type that has been assigned according to randomization&#xD;
      scheme. Do not over compact. The patient's blood is the preferred hydration material for&#xD;
      mixing with the graft material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of a collagen membrane is mandatory in order to ensure capture of the graft material.&#xD;
      The Evolution membrane will be trimmed according the size of the defect and will be adapted&#xD;
      over the bone cavity in attaching the ends underneath the adjacent soft tissue. The mucosal&#xD;
      margins will be fixed in place in using &quot;mattress sutures&quot;. Removal of sutures will take&#xD;
      place ten (10) days thereafter. Information on all surgical materials used in the alveolar&#xD;
      socket procedures that remain in the patient and any other ancillary procedures used to treat&#xD;
      the patient will be documented in the according Case Report Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post surgical medications should be standardized for all study patients, see the above&#xD;
      reported material and methods section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photographs of each of the treated sites will be done to document the condition of the site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation of a bite blocks are essential to ensure proper radiographic alignment for&#xD;
      subsequent periapical radiographs ( see materials and methods section). A periapical&#xD;
      radiograph will be obtained for each study alveolar socket after tooth extraction to&#xD;
      determine if complete removal of the teeth has been achieved. Please provide the radiographic&#xD;
      files with the patient study identification, the date, and the tooth site number. For centers&#xD;
      using conventional radiographic films, only original radiographs can be used for evaluation&#xD;
      and analysis. The use of duplicate original film will therefore be needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VISIT 3 Healing Assessment (10 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will return to clinic and be examined for healing assessment and suture removal.&#xD;
      Patients will be interviewed for determination of any signs or symptoms of medical events.&#xD;
      Clinical assessments of the treated sites will be done as described in the Special Procedures&#xD;
      section. The condition of the membrane will be documented. After suture removal the sites&#xD;
      will be inspected to ensure the proper seating of the membrane and that no spillage of graft&#xD;
      material is observed. All information will be documented on the specific Case Report Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4 Membrane Assessment (Month 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will return for membrane healing assessment. The condition of the membrane will&#xD;
      be documented and registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impressions will be taken to obtain study casts to evaluate volumetric changes of the&#xD;
      extraction socket site with the use of a computerized software system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 5 Implant Placement ( Month 4 )&#xD;
&#xD;
      An evaluation of the implant sites will be done prior to the implant placement procedures. If&#xD;
      any residues of the collagen membrane will be observed the findings will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impressions will be taken to obtain study casts to evaluate volumetric changes of the&#xD;
      extraction socket site with the use of a computerized software system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A perioprobe will be used to measure the thickness of the mucosa at the crestal center and&#xD;
      the buccal (3 mm distant from central aspect) lingual position (3 mm distant from the central&#xD;
      aspect) of where the implant will be placed. These values will be recorded in millimeters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mucoperiosteal flap has to be raised and clinical measurements were taken using an&#xD;
      individualized template. All surgeries will be performed under clean conditions keeping the&#xD;
      implant sterile throughout placement. Procedures indicated in Biotec surgical manual will be&#xD;
      followed and final drilling should be performed with low speed, high torque, irrigating hand&#xD;
      piece and drills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of preparing the osteotomy site, a trephine drill will be used and all bone material&#xD;
      removed with the drill will be preserved for histological analysis. The length of the core&#xD;
      needs to be 6 to 8 mm to be sufficient for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific dimensions of the implant will be at the discretion of the investigator. The&#xD;
      implant catalog and lot numbers will be documented. At completion of implant placement&#xD;
      procedures record the ultimate position of the seating surface: Sup = supracrestal, Cres =&#xD;
      crestal, or Sub = subcrestal. All information including the position and the size of the&#xD;
      chosen implants will be documented on the appropriate Case Report Form. Moreover, the need&#xD;
      for simultaneous GBR procedures should be registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final torque and use of the ratchet will be recorded along with the amount of rotation&#xD;
      applied to the implant on the appropriate Case Report Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A periapical radiograph will be obtained of all grafted sites (at the beginning of the visit)&#xD;
      and an additional one will be taken of all study implants after the implant placement surgery&#xD;
      is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 6 Healing Assessment( 1 Week Post-implant Placement)&#xD;
&#xD;
      An evaluation of the status of the implant surgical sites will be done. Scores for gingival&#xD;
      inflammation, gingival and plaque indices, implant mobility, peri-implant radiolucency and&#xD;
      suppuration will be recorded on appropriate Case Report Form. An evaluation of the patient's&#xD;
      oral health will be done by scoring gingival and plaque indices as described in the Special&#xD;
      Procedures section. The final restoration is at the discretion of the investigator and&#xD;
      according to the treatment plan design within six (6) months of implant placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The insertion of a temporary prosthesis will be accomplished at the investigator's&#xD;
      discretion; he may also fabricate the final restoration directly. The insertion of the&#xD;
      restoration will not take place before four months in the mandible and six on the maxilla&#xD;
      after implant placement surgery the delivery of the final prosthesis will be completed.&#xD;
      Information on prosthesis composition, insertion, outcome, anchorage and abutments used will&#xD;
      be recorded on the appropriate Case Report Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 7, 8 and 9 Clinical Assessment (12, 18 and 24 Months)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up evaluations will be carried out at six month intervals following implant placement&#xD;
      surgery for two years. At each follow-up interval, patients will return to the clinic for&#xD;
      assessment of implant and periodontal tissue. A periapical radiograph of all study implants&#xD;
      will be obtained. All data gathered at these evaluations will be recorded on appropriate Case&#xD;
      Report Forms. Scores for site-specific gingival inflammation, gingival and plaque indices,&#xD;
      implant mobility, peri-implant radiolucency, and suppuration will be recorded on appropriate&#xD;
      Case Report Form. An evaluation of the patient's oral health will be done by scoring gingival&#xD;
      and plaque indices as described in the Special Procedures section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By the end of 6 months after implant placement surgery the delivery of the final prosthesis&#xD;
      will be completed. Information on prosthesis composition, insertion, outcome, anchorage and&#xD;
      abutments used will be recorded on appropriate Case Report Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any proposed change to the protocol is to be discussed with the clinical monitor in a timely&#xD;
      manner. Once both the investigators and the sponsor have accepted the changes by, a written&#xD;
      addendum to the protocol or a revised protocol will be sent to the investigators for&#xD;
      signature. Copies of addenda and revised protocols will be kept by both parties in their&#xD;
      respective files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS AND VIOLATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Occasionally during the study, deviations from the procedures established in the protocol may&#xD;
      occur. Any deviation from the protocol is reason to contact the clinical monitor without&#xD;
      delay. The deviation will be documented on the Patient Status Form. Enrollment and treatment&#xD;
      of patients who do not meet Admission Criteria will be considered a protocol violation.&#xD;
