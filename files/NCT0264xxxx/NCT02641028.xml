      A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Crossover Design Study of CERC-501 in a Human&#xD;
      Laboratory Model of Smoking Behavior.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be performed in subjects who are heavy cigarette smokers currently not seeking&#xD;
      treatment for tobacco use disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a crossover design study (within-subject analysis), which allows for subjects to&#xD;
      be their own control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each period of the crossover consists of a 7-day out-patient treatment period followed by a&#xD;
      single in-patient testing day on Day 8. Subjects will participate in a laboratory session&#xD;
      following the McKee Smoking Lapse Test and be discharged from the clinic to undergo a 7 day&#xD;
      washout period followed by the second period of the crossover design and a 7-day follow-up&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
