  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will investigate the combination of two anti-cancer agents to treat patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and ovarian cancers. Oral topotecan has US&#xD;
      FDA approval for treating select gynecological cancers and SCLC. LCL161 is an investigational&#xD;
      product that has been shown in clinical trials to work together with other anti-cancer&#xD;
      agents. In this trial, investigators will determine the optimal dose of LCL161 and topotecan&#xD;
      to administer to patients with relapsed/refractory SCLC and ovarian cancers, and examine the&#xD;
      safety profile of the drug combination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, non-randomized dose-escalation study of oral LCL161&#xD;
      administered in combination with oral topotecan. Topotecan is US FDA approved for treating&#xD;
      metastatic ovarian cancer, stage IV-B cervical cancer, and small cell lung cancer (SCLC).&#xD;
      LCL161, an investigational product, is an oral small-molecule antagonist of inhibitors of&#xD;
      apoptosis proteins (IAPs). Preclinical data suggests that IAP antagonists work in synergy&#xD;
      with other anti-cancer agents. This study is designed to evaluate the combination of these&#xD;
      two agents in patients with SCLC and ovarian cancers where treatment with topotecan would be&#xD;
      appropriate. The study will be conducted in 2 parts. In the dose-escalation part of the&#xD;
      study, patients with relapsed/refractory SCLC and gynecologic malignancies will be eligible&#xD;
      for enrollment to determine the optimal dose of the drug combination to be administered.&#xD;
      Patients can continue treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The&#xD;
      dose-expansion part of the study is limited to patients with ovarian cancer and&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory SCLC (2 cohorts with 12 patients each) to further assess safety and&#xD;
      preliminary anti-tumor activity. Up to 52 patients are planned for enrollment at 3 centers in&#xD;
      the U.S.&#xD;

    <description>Dose Escalation: Groups of 3-6 patients per dose level (DL) will initiate treatment in escalating doses until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. MTD is defined as the highest combination of doses that results in dose-limiting toxicities for 2 of 6 patients per dosing group.&#xD;
LCL161: orally, on Days 1, 8, 15 of each 21-day cycle. Maximum dose not to exceed 1200 mg/week.&#xD;
topotecan: orally, for first 5 days of each 21-day cycle. Maximum dose not to exceed 2.3 mg/m2 per day.&#xD;
Pegylated GCSF (PEG-GCSF) on-body injector (OBI) or daily GCSF (e.g. filgrastim) will be given according to institutional policy after Day 5 of topotecan. Because patients treated with topotecan are at high risk of developing febrile neutropenia, GCSF will be given in the prophylactic setting.&#xD;
Dose Expansion: 24 additional patients will be treated at the MTD in 2 cohorts (SCLC-12 patients; ovarian cancer-12 patients)</description>
