    <textblock>
      Aim of the study is to evaluate a new brace that has become available, the Peak Scoliosis&#xD;
      Brace (Aspen Medical Products) designed to alleviate pain for adult patients with chronic&#xD;
      pain secondary to scoliosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 adults with back pain secondary to Idiopathic Scoliosis will be recruited. The sample size&#xD;
      was calculated considering the data collected during the development of the brace in the US.&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated at baseline immediately before starting with the brace and after 4&#xD;
      weeks and 6 months. The brace must be worn for at least 2-4 hours per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each evaluation they will be asked to fill the questionnaires, to be used as outcome&#xD;
      measure of the results.&#xD;

      Background: Some adult scoliosis patients suffer significant back pain and risk increased&#xD;
      curvature leading to postural collapse. The main approach for these patients according to the&#xD;
      current literature is the surgical one, however, surgery is not without complications, is not&#xD;
      appropriate for all patients and certain patients do not choose to undergo surgery. Despite&#xD;
      the fact that scoliosis has been estimated to affect up to 68% of the population over 60,&#xD;
      there is scant literature about conservative treatments for adult scoliosis; a case report&#xD;
      and a case series demonstrated the effectiveness of scoliosis specific exercise to stop&#xD;
      progression, while another study reported the effectiveness of a soft brace in reducing pain&#xD;
      at short time. Custom fabricated rigid torso braces, similar to those commonly used for&#xD;
      children are sometimes used in adult patients, however, the goal of these braces is to&#xD;
      correct and/or sustain the sagittal plane of patients, no data have been published on the&#xD;
      efficacy of these braces in relief of pain, and such braces are typically not well tolerated&#xD;
      by adults. Recently a new brace has become available, the Peak Scoliosis Brace (Aspen Medical&#xD;
      Products) designed to alleviate pain for adult patients with chronic pain secondary to&#xD;
      scoliosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: to test the efficacy of the Peak Scoliosis Brace in reducing pain in adult scoliosis&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: prospective cohort study. Population: 20 adults with back pain secondary to&#xD;
      Idiopathic Scoliosis. The sample size was calculated considering the data collected during&#xD;
      the development of the brace in the US, and the first 2 patients fitted in Italy. Setting&#xD;
      alpha at 0.05 and the power at 0.8, with a mean expected improvement of 2 point in the pain&#xD;
      NRS, 16 patients would be necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the possibility of 25% drop out the investigators decided to recruit 20 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: If data will be normally distributed, the investigators will use a&#xD;
      paired t-test. Otherwise, non-parametric statistical tests will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol: patients will be evaluated at baseline immediately before starting with the brace&#xD;
      and after 4 weeks and 6 months. The brace must be worn for at least 2-4 hours per day. At&#xD;
      each evaluation they will be asked to fill the NRS, Rolland Morris Questionnaire and COMI.&#xD;
