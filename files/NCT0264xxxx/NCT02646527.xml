  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: There has been significant progress in symptom management, pain relief and&#xD;
      improvement of quality of life in patients nearing death by implementing palliative care&#xD;
      programs. Existential and dignity related issues, such as loss of autonomy and sense of&#xD;
      meaning or feeling a burden to others are frequent reasons for psychological distress and&#xD;
      desire for hastened death. Dignity Therapy (DT), developed by Chochinov et al., is a brief,&#xD;
      individualized psychotherapy for the purpose of relieving distress by directly addressing&#xD;
      dignity conserving factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: To test whether the inclusion of a patient's partner or designated family member into&#xD;
      Dignity Therapy (DT+) could mitigate psychological distress (anxiety and depression) in both,&#xD;
      the patient nearing the end of his life experiencing increased psychological distress and the&#xD;
      patient's partner/family member compared to the control groups receiving Dignity Therapy in&#xD;
      the single setting (DT) or standard palliative care (SPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and design: In this randomized controlled trial a total of 159 patients with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of an advanced disease and poor prognosis (life expectancy &lt; 6 months) who receive&#xD;
      palliative care either in the Palliative Care Centre of the University Hospital Zurich (USZ)&#xD;
      or the Clinic Susenberg, Zurich, or in the &quot;Lighthouse&quot; Hospice Zurich, will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to either DT+, DT, or SPC in a 1:1:1 ratio. Patients will be pre-screened and&#xD;
      included if they report increased psychological distress (anxiety, depression using the&#xD;
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale=HADS). The therapy is guided by trained therapists and&#xD;
      consists of 3 audiotaped sessions. The main focus of the intervention is to invite patients&#xD;
      to reflect on their most important achievements, roles or other things in their lives or&#xD;
      things that they would most want remembered. On completion, the audiorecording is transcribed&#xD;
      and edited to provide a clear and readable narrative, the generativity document, which can be&#xD;
      passed to a person of the patient's choice. DT+, in contrast to the original intervention&#xD;
      developed by Chochinov et al., is a systemic approach in which patient's partners or&#xD;
      designated family members are included.&#xD;

    <description>Dignity Therapy (DT) is a brief psychotherapeutic intervention developed by Chochinov (2012) which has been shown to enhance the end of life experience in people with life-limiting conditions. DT focuses on helping patients with terminal illnesses to go over things that are most meaningful to them and document their legacy. Dignity Therapy+ (DT+) involves patient and partner/family asking questions about their most important achievements, roles and other important aspects of life. DT+ encourages patients saying things to loved ones that have remained unsaid. DT+ consists of 3 sessions (1. introduction (30'); 2. main session (60'), 3. final session (30')) and will be conducted by a trained therapist. All therapy session will be audio-taped, transcribed verbatim by the study coordinator, edited by the therapist and returned to the patient or the patient and partner/family as a 'generativity document'.</description>
