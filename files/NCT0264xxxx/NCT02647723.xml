  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test whether nutritional supplementation during pregnancy is&#xD;
      associated with 1) improved maternal health during pregnancy; 2) improved infant birth and&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental outcomes, and 3) whether the association between nutritional&#xD;
      supplementation during pregnancy and infant outcomes is partially mediated by reductions in&#xD;
      maternal perceived stress and stress reactivity during pregnancy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low-income pregnant women often experience chronic stress and consequently higher levels of&#xD;
      stress hormones. In utero exposure to high levels of stress hormones can negatively affect&#xD;
      the developing fetus and the infant's capacity for emotion and behavioral regulation. This&#xD;
      program of research is designed to reduce the negative impact of prenatal stress on infant&#xD;
      health and development via nutritional supplementation of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) during&#xD;
      pregnancy. DHA is a long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid member of the omega-3 fatty acid&#xD;
      family. DHA is found in its highest concentrations in neural cell membranes, affecting&#xD;
      receptor function, neurotransmitter uptake, and signal transmission. There is growing&#xD;
      evidence that low levels of dietary DHA intake are associated with suboptimal response to&#xD;
      stress and that DHA supplementation can modulate stress response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred sixty-two pregnant women will be randomly assigned to receive 450 mg/daily of DHA&#xD;
      or placebo beginning at 9-12 weeks of gestation through the end of pregnancy. Perceived&#xD;
      stress, stressful life events, anxiety, and depression, inflammatory markers, DHA levels and&#xD;
      response to a laboratory stressor will be assessed at baseline and at 24, 30, and 36 weeks of&#xD;
      pregnancy. Neonatal outcomes (e.g., gestational age, birth weight, delivery complications)&#xD;
      will be collected from medical records, and infant neurodevelopmental outcomes and stress&#xD;
      reactivity will be assessed at 1, 4 and 9 months of age. Coded data will be analyzed by the&#xD;
      Investigators at University of Chicago and University of Pittsburgh&#xD;
