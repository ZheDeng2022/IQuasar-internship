  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients complain to clinicians that they have difficulty sleeping appears to be due to&#xD;
      environmental noise. There is a common perception that acute noises are more troublesome than&#xD;
      continuous noises in the effect on individual sleep quality. Therefore the goal is to use a&#xD;
      Marpac white noise maker with a continuous noise to see its effect on individuals that have&#xD;
      difficulty sleeping in a high noise environment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia patients will be recruited based on their perception of high noise in their&#xD;
      apartment. The investigators will screen patients during the first meeting using The Mini&#xD;
      International Neuropsychiatric Interview 6.0 (MINI 6.0). At baseline, an Insomnia Severity&#xD;
      Index will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of a one week baseline period in which noise levels will be monitored&#xD;
      using spectral analysis and decibel levels and sleep duration will be recorded using a&#xD;
      subjective sleep log and wrist actigraphy for objective measurement. At the end of the first&#xD;
      week an Insomnia Severity Index will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the second week, a treatment period with a white noise machine using a fixed decibel&#xD;
      level will be installed in the bedrooms of the subjects. The room noise will continue to be&#xD;
      monitored via spectral analysis as well as decibel levels while the patients are wearing&#xD;
      actigraphs and keeping a sleep log. At the end of the second week an Insomnia Severity Index&#xD;
      will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the third week, the white noise machine will be removed and the rooms will still be&#xD;
      monitored for sound via spectral analysis and decibel levels and the subject will wear an&#xD;
      actigraph and keep a sleep log. At the end of the third week an Insomnia Severity Index will&#xD;
      be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline vs. white noise to&#xD;
      analyze differences. The investigators will use an Acute Noise Index, in which noise spikes&#xD;
      of 2 standard deviations from the mean of the entire nights decibel levels count as a noise&#xD;
      event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Noise levels in subjects bedroom will be collected throughout the study along with subjects&#xD;
      sleep activity using an actigraph and sleep log.&#xD;
