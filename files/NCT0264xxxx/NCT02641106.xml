  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The three-month short-course treatment with isoniazid [H] and rifapentine [P] (3HP) recently&#xD;
      recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention could dramatically increase the&#xD;
      number of persons starting and completing treatment for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI),&#xD;
      but TB providers nationwide are hamstrung by the requirement that 3HP only be administered by&#xD;
      directly observed therapy (DOT) in which patients are watched taking each medication dose&#xD;
      in-person. We developed a novel mHealth application that allows patients to make and send&#xD;
      videos of each medication dose ingested that are watched by healthcare providers via a&#xD;
      HIPAA-compliant website to remotely monitor LTBI treatment adherence (Video DOT [VDOT]). This&#xD;
      study will determine whether monitoring patients with VDOT achieves higher treatment&#xD;
      completion rates and greater patient acceptability at lower cost than clinic-based in-person&#xD;
      DOT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Building on our novel VDOT System that includes text messaging reminders and HIPAA-compliant&#xD;
      cloud-based administration, we hypothesize that VDOT can be expanded to provide higher&#xD;
      treatment completion rates at a lower cost than in-person DOT for LTBI treatment using 3HP.&#xD;
      We propose a randomized controlled trial to address the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To determine whether LTBI treatment completion and adherence are greater for patients&#xD;
      treated with 3HP administered via VDOT versus in-person DOT, and to identify patient factors&#xD;
      associated with these outcomes; Aim 2: To compare acceptability of treatment by patients on&#xD;
      VDOT versus in-person DOT, and identify factors associated with differences in acceptability;&#xD;
      Aim 3: To calculate the cost-effectiveness of VDOT compared to in-person DOT for&#xD;
      administering 3HP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the study aims we will conduct a randomized controlled trial in which TB contacts&#xD;
      and refugees in San Diego who are prescribed 3HP for LTBI treatment by their physician will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to be monitored for adherence via either VDOT or in-person DOT (Figure&#xD;
      2). Approximately 100 patients per year over three years (n=155/arm) will be recruited&#xD;
      through the San Diego County TB Control and Refugee Health Program (TCRHP) clinics for the&#xD;
      trial. Patients assigned to VDOT will be given a smartphone with service and taught to send&#xD;
      videos of themselves taking each weekly medication dose; patients in the in-person DOT arm&#xD;
      will visit the clinic each week to be observed by a healthcare worker taking their LTBI&#xD;
      medication. Medication adherence will be monitored for all participants until they have taken&#xD;
      all 12 doses or 16 weeks (limit recommended by the CDC to complete treatment), to compare&#xD;
      treatment adherence rates and patient acceptance across trial arms. Participants will&#xD;
      complete brief (20 minute) baseline and follow-up assessment interviews to obtain information&#xD;
      about potential confounders and effect modifiers of adherence and patient acceptance&#xD;
      regarding their treatment administration method. Cost-benefit analyses will also be conducted&#xD;
      to assist in developing policies around the use of VDOT for 3HP. Since participants will be&#xD;
      recruited after they have been prescribed 3HP by their healthcare provider and all patient&#xD;
      care will be continued through their provider, no medications will be prescribed or treatment&#xD;
      decisions made this study.&#xD;

    <description>VDOT arm participants use a smartphone to make a video recording of each weekly medication dose ingested using the VDOT mobile phone app. The VDOT app is programmed to send encrypted, time/date stamped videos to a HIPAA-compliant server as soon as the video recorder is stopped. Clinic staff monitor videos as they arrive using a password protected website and document each medication dose that is taken. Dose 1 is observed in-person; doses 2-12 are observed via videos.</description>

    <description>Video Directly Observed Therapy (VDOT) is a novel means of remotely observing patients ingesting medications using videos sent from a smartphone. VDOT was developed and found to be feasible and acceptable for monitoring daily treatment of active TB in San Diego, CA and Tijuana, B.C., Mexico (R21-AI088326; PI: R. Garfein). Patients are taught how to use the VDOT recording app, record medication ingestion, and contact their physician when side effects occur. Participants are trained at the time of their first LTBI treatment dose to ensure participants know how to record videos. All remaining 11 weekly doses are taken and recorded wherever the participant chooses. Clinic staff monitor videos as they arrive using a password protected website and document each medication dose that is taken.</description>
