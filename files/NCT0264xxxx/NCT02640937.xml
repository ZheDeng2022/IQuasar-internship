      This was a prospective study performed between November 2011 and September 2013. Patients&#xD;
      with a confirmed S. epidermidis infection after fracture fixation or prosthetic joint&#xD;
      infection were included. Exclusion criteria included infections involving external fixation&#xD;
      pins, infections without any implanted hardware and culture positive patients not displaying&#xD;
      any clinical sign of infection. The following surgical parameters were documented: affected&#xD;
      bone or joint; type of implant; time between implantation of the device and onset of&#xD;
      symptoms. Personal characteristics and patients'health status were also documented. Any&#xD;
      revision surgeries involving the site of interest and all isolated pathogens were recorded&#xD;
      throughout the course of treatment and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow up examination was performed an average of 26 months after discharge. Primary&#xD;
      outcome at follow up was cure. Cure was define by the authors as: missing local (at site of&#xD;
      interest) or systemic signs of infection, terminated surgical and systemic therapy and&#xD;
      restoration of joint or limb function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first surgical procedure after enrolment, at least four deep bone biopsies were taken&#xD;
      from the interface between implant and affected bone. Identification and antibiotic&#xD;
      susceptibility testing of all growth was performed. Multi-drug-resistance (MDR) was defined&#xD;
      according to the definitions of the European Committee of Antimicrobial Susceptibility&#xD;
      Testing (EUCAST). Biofilm formation was analysed and quantified in microtitre plate assays&#xD;
      according to protocol of Stepanovic et al.(see references).&#xD;

      This was a prospective study performed between November 2011 and September 2013. All patients&#xD;
      provided informed written consent prior to inclusion in the study. Inclusion criteria were&#xD;
      deep S. epidermidis infections after fracture fixation or prosthetic joint surgery. Fracture&#xD;
      fixation infections includes fractures involving the long bones as well as the pelvis and the&#xD;
      spine. Bacterial growth at the site of interest in combination with either pseudarthrosis,&#xD;
      implant-loosening/failure or local and systemic signs of surgical site infection were&#xD;
      required for inclusion. Exclusion criteria included infections involving external fixation&#xD;
      pins, infections without any implanted hardware and culture positive patients not displaying&#xD;
      any clinical sign of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon entry into the study, the following surgical parameters were documented: affected bone&#xD;
      or joint; type of implant; time between implantation of the device and onset of symptoms.&#xD;
      Personal characteristics were also documented and included: gender; age; body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI); smoker/non-smoker; overall medical condition (Charlson comorbidity index); and chronic&#xD;
      immunosuppressive conditions (Diabetes mellitus, chronic alcoholism, Child's class C&#xD;
      cirrhosis, neoplasia, transplantation, AIDS and steroid medication). Any revision surgeries&#xD;
      involving the site of interest and all isolated pathogens were recorded throughout the course&#xD;
      of treatment and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow up examination was performed an average of 26 months after discharge. Primary&#xD;
      outcome at follow up was cure. Cure was define by the authors as: missing local (at site of&#xD;
      interest) or systemic signs of infection and terminated surgical and systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first surgical procedure after enrolment, at least four deep bone biopsies were taken&#xD;
      from the interface between implant and affected bone. The tissue samples were placed in a&#xD;
      sterile container with thioglycollate liquid medium (bioMérieux, Hazelwood, MO, USA). The&#xD;
      samples were cultured for ten days at 37°C and examined each day macroscopically. Any growth&#xD;
      was inoculated onto a blood agar plate (bioMérieux, Hazelwood, MO, USA) for further growth&#xD;
      and subsequent identification. In all cases, additional swabs and soft tissue samples may&#xD;
      have been taken as per clinical routine, however, only samples adjacent to the implant were&#xD;
      used for diagnosis in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of all growth was performed using a&#xD;
      Vitek2 (bioMerieux Vitek Inc, Hazelwood, MO, USA). Multi-drug-resistance (MDR) was defined&#xD;
      according to the definitions of the European Committee of Antimicrobial Susceptibility&#xD;
      Testing (EUCAST). Oxacillin resistance was used as an indicator for methicillin resistant S.&#xD;
      epidermidis (MRSE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biofilm formation was analysed and quantified in microtitre plate assays according to the&#xD;
      well-established protocol of Stepanovic et al.(see references). This method traditionally&#xD;
      assigns isolates to one of four categories: non-biofilm-formers and weak, moderate or strong&#xD;
      biofilm-formers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key variables with regards to bacterial phenotype were: biofilm formation; methicillin&#xD;
      resistance; and multidrug resistance. The primary outcome measure was whether the infection&#xD;
      was &quot;cured&quot; or not. Primary outcome parameters were calculated as a function of all patients&#xD;
      for whom data was complete. Statistical comparison was restricted to the lower extremity&#xD;
      cohort since the other patients are not scored for many of the functional outcome measures&#xD;
      and as such incomplete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Univariate logistic regression models were used to determine the influence of each prognostic&#xD;
      factor (obesity, smoking, diabetes mellitus, chronic immune suppression, open fracture&#xD;
      (initially), early onset infection, biofilm formation, methicillin resistance, MDR and&#xD;
      Charlson comorbidity index) on cure. P-values &lt;0.05 were considered signiﬁcant. Statistical&#xD;
      analyses were performed using SAS software (Version 9.2; Cary, NC, USA).&#xD;

    <description>Cure was define by the authors as: missing local (at site of interest) or systemic signs of infection and terminated surgical and systemic antibiotic therapy. All Parameters had to be positive to fulfill the outcome parameter &quot;cure&quot;.If one of the mentioned parameters was negative, outcome was defined as &quot;not cured&quot;. Local signs of infection were defined as the appearance of: redness, tenderness, swelling or persisting wound drainage.</description>
