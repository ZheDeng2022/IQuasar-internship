  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is a non-inferiority trial comparing the efficacy of a lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention delivered entirely via an online social network to a traditional lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention delivered via group meetings.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lifestyle interventions have had established efficacy for over a decade but are still not&#xD;
      widely disseminated, largely due to high cost and patient and provider burden. Online social&#xD;
      networks are an alternative way to deliver lifestyle counseling and delivery via this&#xD;
      modality may virtually eliminate patient visits, the main source of cost and burden in&#xD;
      traditional modalities. Interactions in online social networks are frequent, brief, and&#xD;
      asynchronous because users login to their online communities during downtime during work and&#xD;
      leisure time, or when they simply feel a need for social connection. As such, social media&#xD;
      becomes embedded into people's daily lives. This provides an opportunity to embed health&#xD;
      behavior change programming into people's daily lives. Thus far in the literature, existing&#xD;
      online social networks have been used as component of web- or mobile app-based lifestyle&#xD;
      interventions but not as the primary modality for intervention delivery. The purpose of this&#xD;
      work is to conduct a non-inferiority trial to compare a lifestyle intervention delivered&#xD;
      entirely via private groups on the online social network Twitter to a traditional in-person&#xD;
      group-based lifestyle intervention. Using a randomized trial (N=328), investigators will test&#xD;
      whether a lifestyle intervention delivered via an online social network (Get Social&#xD;
      condition) will result in a mean percent weight loss at 12 months that is not appreciably&#xD;
      worse than the gold-standard in-person group-based lifestyle intervention (Traditional&#xD;
      condition), i.e., the social network arm will not lose on average 2% less than the in-person&#xD;
      arm. Secondary non-inferiority outcomes include weight loss at 12 months, and dietary intake&#xD;
      and physical activity at 12-months. Investigators hypothesize that the Get Social condition&#xD;
      will be less expensive than the Traditional condition. To understand for whom an online&#xD;
      social network modality is most suited, investigators will test predictors of weight loss in&#xD;
      the Get Social condition including engagement, age, sociability, neuroticism, openness, and&#xD;
      smartphone and social network use. Investigators hypothesize that people who are younger,&#xD;
      more sociable, engage more on the social network, higher in neuroticism/openness, and heavier&#xD;
      overall smartphone and social network users will lose more weight in the Get Social&#xD;
      condition. Findings from this study may support an intervention delivery modality that is&#xD;
      more conducive to settings like worksites, health plans, and clinics that serve large&#xD;
      populations but have limited space, staffing, and resources for traditional in person&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;

    <measure>Cost Associated With Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>12-months</time_frame>
    <description>Total time to deliver the intervention and administrative time was tracked during the study for each condition and cost was calculated using national median salary for dietitians &amp; nutritionists and administrative assistants &amp; secretaries, and national fringe data for all civilian workers across all industries from Bureau of Labor Statistics. Hourly rate based on salary plus fringe divided by 2080 hours (40 hours/week x 52 weeks). Administrative tasks charged at administrative assistant salary rate, all other treatment delivery tasks charged at dietitian rate. Dollars per participant was calculated by dividing total cost for each condition by the number of participants in that condition.</description>

    <description>Weight Management Support Inventory to assess social support for weight management. The directions ask respondents to rate on a 5-point scale how frequently they experienced a certain interaction with other people in the past 4 weeks, ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (daily). The items also ask how helpful that event was when it occurred, rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (not helpful) to 5 (extremely helpful). Higher scores indicate more frequent or more helpful social support events. We asked this about four potential social groups: family, friends, friends on Twitter, and friends on Facebook.</description>

    <description>Openness to Experience and Neuroticism/Emotional Stability were measured using the Ten-Item Personality Inventory. The Ten-Item Personality Inventory consists of 10 items that measure the five dimensions of the Five Factor model of personality. Participants are asked to respond to a series of words with personality descriptions with the prompt &quot;I see myself as&quot; with response options of 1 (&quot;Disagree Strongly&quot;) to 7 (&quot;Agree Strongly&quot;). Opposite items are reverse coded. Items for Emotional Stability/Neuroticism are &quot;anxious, easily upset&quot; and &quot;calm, emotionally stable&quot;. Items for Openness to experience are &quot;open to new experiences, complex&quot; or &quot;conventional, uncreative.&quot; The average of the scores represents each dimension with higher scores indicating higher levels of Openness or Emotional Stability (and lower levels of Neuroticism).</description>

    <description>Get Social participants will receive a weight loss intervention in a &quot;protected&quot; Twitter group. The intervention content will be structured to deliver in an online context. The online coaches will post daily content, respond to questions, address concerns, and encourage engagement. The weight loss intervention is based on the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), an evidence-based weight loss program focused on lifestyle changes. The goals for the intervention are 175 minutes of moderate physical activity per week and an overall weight loss of 7%. Each participant will get an individualized calorie goal that would facilitate a 1-2 lbs. weight loss weekly. Participants will also be encouraged to use an app such as MyFitnessPal to track daily diet.</description>

The weight loss intervention is based on the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), an evidence-based weight loss program focused on lifestyle changes. The goals for the intervention are 175 minutes of moderate physical activity per week and an overall weight loss of 7%. Each participant will get an individualized calorie goal that would facilitate a 1-2 lbs. weight loss weekly. Participants will also be encouraged to use an app such as MyFitnessPal to track daily diet.&#xD;

The intervention content will be structured to deliver in an online context. The online coaches will post daily content, respond to questions, address concerns, and encourage engagement. The weight loss intervention is based on the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), an evidence-based weight loss program focused on lifestyle changes. The goals for the intervention are 175 minutes of moderate physical activity per week and an overall weight loss of 7%. Each participant will get an individualized calorie goal that would facilitate a 1-2 lbs. weight loss weekly. Participants will also be encouraged to use an app such as MyFitnessPal to track daily diet.&#xD;

        <description>Weight Management Support Inventory to assess social support for weight management. The directions ask respondents to rate on a 5-point scale how frequently they experienced a certain interaction with other people in the past 4 weeks, ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (daily). The items also ask how helpful that event was when it occurred, rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (not helpful) to 5 (extremely helpful). Higher scores indicate more frequent or more helpful social support events. We asked this about four potential social groups: family, friends, friends on Twitter, and friends on Facebook.</description>

        <title>Social Support for Weight Loss</title>
        <description>Weight Management Support Inventory to assess social support for weight management. The directions ask respondents to rate on a 5-point scale how frequently they experienced a certain interaction with other people in the past 4 weeks, ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (daily). The items also ask how helpful that event was when it occurred, rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (not helpful) to 5 (extremely helpful). Higher scores indicate more frequent or more helpful social support events. We asked this about four potential social groups: family, friends, friends on Twitter, and friends on Facebook.</description>

            <description>Get Social participants will receive a weight loss intervention in a &quot;protected&quot; Twitter group. The intervention content will be structured to deliver in an online context. The online coaches will post daily content, respond to questions, address concerns, and encourage engagement. The weight loss intervention is based on the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), an evidence-based weight loss program focused on lifestyle changes. The goals for the intervention are 175 minutes of moderate physical activity per week and an overall weight loss of 7%. Each participant will get an individualized calorie goal that would facilitate a 1-2 lbs. weight loss weekly. Participants will also be encouraged to use an app such as MyFitnessPal to track daily diet.&#xD;

        <title>Neuroticism/Emotional Stability and Openness to Experience</title>
        <description>Openness to Experience and Neuroticism/Emotional Stability were measured using the Ten-Item Personality Inventory. The Ten-Item Personality Inventory consists of 10 items that measure the five dimensions of the Five Factor model of personality. Participants are asked to respond to a series of words with personality descriptions with the prompt &quot;I see myself as&quot; with response options of 1 (&quot;Disagree Strongly&quot;) to 7 (&quot;Agree Strongly&quot;). Opposite items are reverse coded. Items for Emotional Stability/Neuroticism are &quot;anxious, easily upset&quot; and &quot;calm, emotionally stable&quot;. Items for Openness to experience are &quot;open to new experiences, complex&quot; or &quot;conventional, uncreative.&quot; The average of the scores represents each dimension with higher scores indicating higher levels of Openness or Emotional Stability (and lower levels of Neuroticism).</description>

        <description>The intervention was divided into different content units delivered either during a meeting (Traditional Condition) or a series of tweets (Get Social Condition). For the Get Social Condition, tweets with intervention content were produced to meet all objectives for each content unit and programmed to go out at set times for each group so 100% of the objectives for each content unit were met. For the Traditional Condition, checklists were created with objectives for each content unit and staff listened to 2 to 3 randomly selected group recordings for each study wave to determine if these objectives were met by the interventionist. Treatment Fidelity was defined as the percentage of objectives delivered by the interventionist for each wave.</description>
