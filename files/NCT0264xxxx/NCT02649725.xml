  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational questionnaire based study measuring the degree of patient&#xD;
      satisfaction with the outcomes of some expensive cytotoxic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tested drugs are trastuzumab, lapatinib, sunitinib, m tor inhibitors, sorafenib,&#xD;
      cetuximab, panitumumab, bevacizumab, erlotinib, rituximab, imatinib mesylate, gefitinib,&#xD;
      abiraterone acetate, cabazitaxel, pertuzumab, fulvestrant, pemetrexate and crizotinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation will be through a predesigned template questionnaire that will be applied to&#xD;
      all the tested drugs. The questions are divided into five categories measuring five items,&#xD;
      the negative impact of the drug on patient's finances, satisfaction with drug efficacy,&#xD;
      toxicity and effect on quality of life, satisfaction with drug availability in the market and&#xD;
      satisfaction with the received education from the treating physician about the drug before&#xD;
      usage. A predesigned questionnaire based scoring system will categorizes the processed data&#xD;
      to low, intermediate and high score for each of the five measured topics. The data will be&#xD;
      processed and each drug will acquire low, moderate or high score. Subsequent recommendations&#xD;
      for revision of the drug price, cost effective analysis studies, physician education about&#xD;
      drug pharmaceutical perspectives will be elaborated for some drugs. The study will clarify&#xD;
      the most annoying and frequently reported side effect for each drug and will suggest&#xD;
      recommendations for its treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is currently recruiting patients.&#xD;
