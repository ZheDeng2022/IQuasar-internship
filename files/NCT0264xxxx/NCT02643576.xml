      This highly innovative experimental trial is designed to examine the independent and joint&#xD;
      effects of prohibiting the use of SNAP-like benefits to purchase foods high in discretionary&#xD;
      calories and offering an incentive to encourage the purchase of more healthful foods.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 1 in 10 Americans participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program&#xD;
      (SNAP), a Federal food and nutrition program administered by the United States Department of&#xD;
      Agriculture (USDA). SNAP, formerly known as the Food Stamp Program, provides funds to&#xD;
      low-income families for the purchase of food. Benefits are provided on an electronic benefits&#xD;
      transfer (EBT) card that is used like an debit card at stores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years there has been growing recognition that SNAP participants are&#xD;
      disproportionately obese, with poor diet contributing to this disparity. In response, there&#xD;
      is great interest in considering ways in which SNAP may better meet its objective to help&#xD;
      people and families buy the food they need for good health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modifications to SNAP currently under evaluation involve offering incentives to encourage&#xD;
      participants to purchase more nutritious food items. There is concern, however, that this&#xD;
      strategy alone may be of limited usefulness in improving the nutritional quality of the diet&#xD;
      for obesity prevention because incentivizing the purchase of more nutritious foods does not&#xD;
      necessarily reduce the purchase of less nutritious foods (substitution effect may not occur)&#xD;
      and may even increase the total calories purchased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative strategy that has been extensively discussed by public health advocates and&#xD;
      policy makers in recent years is prohibiting the purchase of less nutritious food items with&#xD;
      SNAP benefits. Commonly consumed foods that are high in discretionary calories (defined as&#xD;
      calories from solid fats, alcohol, and added sugars) are prime targets for exclusion because&#xD;
      SNAP participants consume far more energy from discretionary calories (43%) than recommended.&#xD;
      This strategy may be particularly effective if implemented in conjunction with incentives for&#xD;
      the purchase of more nutritious foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No studies have been conducted to evaluate whether prohibiting the purchase of foods high in&#xD;
      discretionary calories with SNAP benefits may improve diet quality and reduce risk of&#xD;
      obesity. Likewise research is lacking on the effect of effect of pairing restrictions with&#xD;
      incentives. Thus, we propose to pilot a highly innovative experimental trial designed to&#xD;
      examine the independent and joint effects of prohibiting the use of SNAP benefits to purchase&#xD;
      foods high in discretionary calories and offering an incentive to encourage the purchase of&#xD;
      more healthful foods. Key indicators of feasibility will include recruitment and retention&#xD;
      (are targeted number of participants recruited and retained at a high rate?); fidelity of the&#xD;
      intervention (are compliance measures successfully collected and do they indicate close&#xD;
      compliance with experimental condition assignment?); and completeness of baseline and&#xD;
      follow-up data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using study data, analyses will be conducted to evaluate the independent and joint effects of&#xD;
      prohibiting the use of SNAP benefits to purchase foods high in discretionary calories and&#xD;
      offering an incentive to encourage the purchase of more nutritious foods.&#xD;

Servings of fruits and servings of vegetables are calculated from the output provided by NDS-R, which are based on the reported food intake as collected via 24-hour dietary recalls. Three recalls are collected at baseline and averaged; three recalls are collected at follow-up and averaged.</description>
