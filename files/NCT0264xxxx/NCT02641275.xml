    <textblock>
      The relentless progressive process of muscular dystrophy requires extraordinary medical,&#xD;
      physical, and emotional care with severe consequences for caring parents (increased stress&#xD;
      and diminished social, psychological and physical well-being). Despite the obvious need of&#xD;
      support for parents only few and weak data exist regarding efficiency and efficacy of&#xD;
      specific interventions supporting parental resilience and coping strategies. The presenting&#xD;
      study aims to fill this gap by evaluating the efficacy of a structured self-management&#xD;
      training for parents of children with severe progressive muscular dystrophy compared to&#xD;
      parents receiving treatment as usual (TAU). In addition, investigators measure established&#xD;
      biomarkers of psychosocial stress, such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, which will be used to&#xD;
      monitor physiological changes with assumed significance for parental health.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relentless progressive process of muscular dystrophy requires extraordinary medical,&#xD;
      physical, and emotional care. As a consequences caring for a patient with a severe chronic&#xD;
      illness has been associated with increased stress and diminished social, psychological and&#xD;
      physical well-being in parents. According to Thompson et al. 57% of parents with Duchenne&#xD;
      muscular dystrophy children have self-reported poor psychological adjustment and, even in&#xD;
      comparison with parents of children with other burdens like cerebral palsy or renal diseases,&#xD;
      muscular dystrophy was associated with a wider spectrum of problems and parental stress.&#xD;
      Moreover, parents are shown to have significant stress by feelings of guilt and associated&#xD;
      difficulty discussing death issues with their children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, despite the obvious need of support for parents only few and weak data exist&#xD;
      regarding efficiency and efficacy of specific interventions supporting parental resilience&#xD;
      and coping strategies. In practice, they are mostly limited to meetings of self-help groups&#xD;
      and casual exchange between concerned parents, which is rather a problem-centered than&#xD;
      proactive solution-focused approach. As a consequence, investigators see a great need for&#xD;
      studies regarding more specific interventions supporting parents' self-management skills,&#xD;
      coping strategies and competencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study evaluates the efficacy of a structured self-management training for parents&#xD;
      of children with severe progressive muscular dystrophy compared to parents receiving&#xD;
      treatment as usual (TAU). In addition, investigators measure established biomarkers of&#xD;
      psychosocial stress, such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, which will be used to monitor&#xD;
      physiological changes with assumed significance for parental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will fill out online-questionnaires before, during and after self-management&#xD;
      training. Training interventions will take place in Zurich as group sessions (10-20&#xD;
      participants per group). Investigators aim for a total of 60-80 participants. Parent-couples&#xD;
      or single participants will be randomized in an intervention group (participants receiving&#xD;
      self-management training) and a non-intervention group (participants continue with already&#xD;
      established support). After one year parents from the non-intervention group will change into&#xD;
      the intervention group with self- management training as well. Questionnaires focus on&#xD;
      assessing parental strain and self- efficacy and will take 30-45minutes for each of four&#xD;
      surveys. Validated biological markers such as cumulative cortisol levels in hair and&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines in the blood will be collected before and after self-management&#xD;
      trainings.&#xD;

    <time_frame>1 1/2 year with control group</time_frame>

    <measure>Change in Experiencing and Behaviour post-intervention (VEV)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 1/2 year with control group</time_frame>
    <description>VEV is a questionnaire developed by Ziele and Kopf-Mehnert, 1978 to test post-intervention change in experiencing and behavior along with a retrospective life-event checklist and a self-rating questionnaire in 42 items. Other than previous questionnaires VEV will be applied only after intervention.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Sum of Abnormal Laboratory Values Concerning Biomarkers of psychosocial stress</measure>
    <time_frame>1 1/2 year with control group</time_frame>
    <description>Significant lower levels of biomarkers of psychosocial stress, i.e. pro-inflammatory cytokines, which can be used to monitor physiological changes with assumed significance for parental health: C-reactive Protein (hsCRP), Tumor-Necrose-Factor alpha (TNFα), Interleukin (IL)-1ß, IL-6, und Interferon Gamma (IFNγ). Items will be aggregated as a numerical factor which shows the difference of a measured value from a reference value . Abnormal laboratory values therefore will be used as a sum.</description>
