      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many people who live in west or central Africa are at risk for infection from a very small&#xD;
      worm called Loa loa. This infection is acquired through the bite of a fly. Baby worms called&#xD;
      microfilariae live in the blood. The infection most commonly causes skin itching, mild&#xD;
      temporary limb swelling, and sometimes a adult worm can be seen in the white of the eye of an&#xD;
      infected individual. Very rarely, people with this infection can develop problems with the&#xD;
      kidneys and heart as a result of the worm s effect on the immune system. Because the vast&#xD;
      majority of people with the infection have minimal symptoms, people in Cameroon usually do&#xD;
      not get treated. But infection with Loa loa can cause serious problems in people who are&#xD;
      being treated for infections with other parasites (namely, river blindness and lymphatic&#xD;
      filariasis). Researchers want to find out of a drug called imatinib can treat Loa loa&#xD;
      infection so that patients with this infection can safely receive other drugs to cure river&#xD;
      blindness and lymphatic filariasis. Researchers believe imatinib can be a safe drug to use on&#xD;
      Loa loa, because in the lab this drug kills the worms slowly, whereas other drugs which can&#xD;
      cause treatment reactions usually kill the worms very quickly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test if imatinib can treat Loa loa infection by killing the worms slowly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18-65 with non-severe Loa loa infection who are otherwise healthy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a physical exam and blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a baseline visit. This will include a physical exam and blood and&#xD;
      urine tests. It may include a stool sample. Participants will be randomly assigned to get 1&#xD;
      dose of either imatinib or a placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will return to the clinic every day for 1 week, then once a week for 3 weeks.&#xD;
      Visits will include a physical exam and blood tests. They will have urine tests in the first&#xD;
      week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have follow-up visits 3, 6, and 12 months after taking the imatinib or&#xD;
      placebo. These include a physical exam and blood tests. They may include urine and stool&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants develop side effects, they will be treated for them.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      With the discovery that people experiencing severe treatment reactions following mass drug&#xD;
      administration (MDA) with ivermectin for onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis control were&#xD;
      co-infected with Loa loa, there has been a need for new filaricidal drugs. Currently, Loa loa&#xD;
      infection, considered relatively nonpathogenic, is not treated in endemic areas. However,&#xD;
      because treatment for Loa loa can result in toxicity in people who are being concurrently&#xD;
      treated for onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis, finding a new treatment for Loa loa has&#xD;
      become a priority. Imatinib has recently been shown to be microfilaricidal in vitro at&#xD;
      concentrations physiologically achievable after a single oral dose in humans. The current&#xD;
      standard in loiasis treatment outside of endemic areas is to treat those with low&#xD;
      microfilarial (MF) levels (less than approximately 8,000MF/mL) with diethylcarbamazine (DEC).&#xD;
      However, at high MF concentrations (&gt;20,000 MF/mL) serious side effects including&#xD;
      encephalopathy and death have occurred with administration of DEC or ivermectin, a widely&#xD;
      distributed microfilaricide throughout Africa. In endemic areas, this risk is avoided by not&#xD;
      treating loiasis altogether. The adverse reactions are believed to be due release of a large&#xD;
      antigen load due to rapid killing of large numbers of MF. The rapidity of killing is believed&#xD;
      to be the main driver of these reactions seen at high MF counts. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to assess how imatinib acts as a slow microfilaricide at levels (&lt;2,500 MF/mL) that have been&#xD;
      safely treated previously with DEC and ivermectin. We aim to perform a dose escalation study&#xD;
      to identify the minimum single oral dose that will be effective as a slow microfiaricidal&#xD;
      drug against Loa loa. If imatinib is found to be effective and have kinetics which favor slow&#xD;
      microfilarial killing, then this can serve as the basis for a larger study in which patients&#xD;
      with very high microfilarial loads would be treated, as this is the at risk population in&#xD;
      current MDA campaigns. This is a double blind, randomized, pilot phase 2 dose-escalation&#xD;
      trial. Subjects will receive a dose of imatinib at 200, 400 or 600 (n = 5 each). Symptoms and&#xD;
      blood microfilarial concentration will be assessed at baseline, daily for the first 7 days,&#xD;
      then weekly for the next 21 days, then at 3, 6, and 12 months. These will be compared against&#xD;
      an untreated placebo-controlled group of 5 subjects who will have the same data collected at&#xD;
      these respective days.&#xD;
