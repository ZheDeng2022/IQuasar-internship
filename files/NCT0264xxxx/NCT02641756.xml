  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this study is to identify and characterise the anatomical component of the&#xD;
      replication competent HIV-1 (Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1) reservoir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the clinically relevant HIV-1 reservoir is hiding in&#xD;
      various but specific anatomic compartments and is able to rebound when therapy is stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This reservoir is probably smaller than the HIV-1 reservoir hiding in the blood but could be&#xD;
      more transcriptional active because of its specific environment, possibly influenced by lower&#xD;
      concentrations of the antiretroviral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current proposal will, for the first time, identify the source of the viral reservoir by&#xD;
      phylogenetically backtracking the viral genome of the rebounding virus to the sequences of&#xD;
      viral DNA (DeoxyriboNucleic Acid) in different anatomical compartments. The subsequent&#xD;
      characterization of the viral reservoir markers (size, integration sites, methylation&#xD;
      profile, stimulation and inhibition assays) will enable us to understand how this viral&#xD;
      rebound occurred.&#xD;
