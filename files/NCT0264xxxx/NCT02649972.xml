    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good or bad, Cobimetinib has in&#xD;
      patients with histiocytosis. Cobimetinib is an investigational oral medication that blocks&#xD;

    <description>by PET Response Criterial (PRC), with a dichotomous BOR of CR or PR versus neither of those. Assuming we use this binary endpoint of response, defined as best overall response of CR or PR versus not using the PET Response Criteria (PRC), a sample size of 18 patients provides 90% power to test the hypothesis that the response rate is promising (defined as 35% or higher) against a non-promising rate of 10% or lower.</description>

    <description>This is an open-label, multicenter, phase II study exploring the efficacy and safety of single-agent Cobimetinib in patients with histiocytic disorders whose tumors are 1) BRAFV600 wildtype or 2) BRAFV600E mutant and are intolerant to, or unable to access, BRAF inhibitors. Visits during the treatment period are to be completed on Day 1, Day 15 (this visit can be by telephone), Day 29, and every 28 days thereafter. For patients treated on the study for six months, at the discretion of the Principal Investigator, visits can be spaced out to every 56 days (every 2 cycles instead of every cycle). After 24 cycles of treatment, if imaging demonstrates sustained stability in the opinion of the principal investigator, tumor assessments can be performed ever 1 year.</description>

    <description>Cobimetinib will be administered at a dose of 60mg daily for 21 days on, then 7 days off, in a 28 day treatment cycle. Patients will have the option to discontinue treatment after 12 cycles and will be monitored for disease relapse for an additional 12 months. In the event that disease relapse occurs within the 12 month monitoring period, patients will restart treatment and continue on study. Upon restarting, the assessment schedule will restart at rechallenge cycle 1(RC-1) and all assessments will occur at the frequency and intervals. Cycle 1 Day 15 visits will not be required for patients that restart treatment after relapse. Participants will re-sign consent upon rechallenging.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Histiocytic disorder must be (a) multi-system disease or (b) disease that is recurrent&#xD;
             or refractory to standard therapies, or (c) single-system disease with that is&#xD;
             unlikely to benefit from conventional and less toxic therapies, based on the best&#xD;
             available evidence (for example, CNS or cardiac infiltration, retroperitoneal&#xD;
             fibrosis, prior chemotherapy, or other medical history or co-morbidities, etc)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy &gt; 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 16 years&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Estimated creatinine clearance of &gt; 50 ml/min&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  As for #7, patients with renal dysfunction deemed to be the result of disease will be&#xD;
             considered eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate liver function, as defined by bilirubin ≤ 1.5 ULN&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Fertile men and women must use an effective method of contraception during treatment&#xD;
             and for at least 6 months after completion of treatment as directed by their&#xD;

             low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly&#xD;
             (for example implants, injectables, combined oral contraception or intra-uterine&#xD;
             devices). At the discretion of the Investigator, acceptable methods of contraception&#xD;
             may include total abstinence in cases where the lifestyle of the patient ensures&#xD;
             compliance. (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
