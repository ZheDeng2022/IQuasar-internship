  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological disorder. Augmentation is the main&#xD;
      complication during long-term DA treatment of RLS. This study aims to examine effect of&#xD;
      Horizant (Gabapentin Enacarbil) on Augmentation in RLS patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an Open label single arm study. The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the&#xD;
      efficacy of Horizant in patients with RLS who exhibit augmentation while on Dopaminergic&#xD;
      therapy. Adult patients (age 18-85 years) with diagnosis of primary RLS (diagnosed by study&#xD;
      investigators) with augmentation on dopaminergic therapy will be screened for participation&#xD;
      in the study. RLS diagnosis will be made by the study investigators using International RLS&#xD;
      study group criteria. Patients with augmentation on dopaminergic therapy as defined by NIH&#xD;
      2007 with ASRS of 5 to 15 will be offered to participate in the study. Inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria are listed below. The study will be performed after approval of the&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board of the University of Missouri.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 50 subjects will be entered into the study over a period of 1 year. Written&#xD;
      consent will be obtained from all patients. After pre-participation evaluation for&#xD;
      eligibility, subjects will be selected and enrolled in the study and followed for a total of&#xD;
      6 follow up visits (Days 0, 30, 90, 120, 180, 360). Subjects Enrollment period will last up&#xD;
      to 12 months. The total duration of study will be 24 months.&#xD;

    <description>Phase1: During phase 1 therapy, Horizant will be added on as an adjunct to all subjects taking part in the study along with stable dose of their current dopaminergic (DA) agent and both medication will be continued for a total period of 90 days from day 0 to day 90. Subjects will be evaluated for three visits (days 0, 30 and 90) during Phase I.&#xD;
Phase 2: At the 90th day follow-up visit, with initiation of phase 2 therapy, all subjects will be tapered off (by 50% reduction in dose each week) of their current dopaminergic agents while maintaining the same dose of Horizant and will be on Horizant monotherapy. All subjects will be evaluated for additional three clinic visits (days 120, 180, 360).</description>
