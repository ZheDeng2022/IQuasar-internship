      Background: Peripheral arterial disease is a result of atherosclerotic occlusion in the major&#xD;
      arteries supplying the lower limbs and is associated with an increased risk of mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity. It results in restricted blood flow to the skeletal muscles causing intermittent&#xD;
      claudication (IC). IC presents as cramp like pain affecting 5% of the population &gt;50 years&#xD;
      and is associated with a substantial reduction in walking capacity, quality of life and&#xD;
      diminished physical function. Supervised exercise programmes have been demonstrated to&#xD;
      improve maximum walking distances and NICE recommends group-based supervised exercise for&#xD;
      treating patients with IC. However, there is significant variability in the impact of&#xD;
      treatment across studies and little agreement on the underlying mechanism whereby exercise&#xD;
      increases functional outcomes. Potential mechanisms include skeletal muscle metabolism, VO2&#xD;
      max, anaerobic threshold and endothelial function. Studies are needed to better understand&#xD;
      how exercise improves outcome and in whom, so as to better refine and target the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participation of patients with IC in exercise programmes is low. The investigators need&#xD;
      to understand factors influencing participation so that we can improve the number of patients&#xD;
      with IC benefiting from the programme&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research consists of two workstreams:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Workstream one&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess the extent to which patient baseline characteristics and candidate physiological&#xD;
      mechanisms are associated with clinical improvement in IC patients participating in an&#xD;
      exercise programme&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: Patients with documented IC referred from a Vascular Consultant. Eligible patients&#xD;
      will be invited to participate in a 12 week supervised exercise programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing Schedule: Measurements will be recorded at baseline (prior to exercise), immediately&#xD;
      after the completion of the exercise programme and then three months after. Measurements&#xD;
      include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline characteristics that might predict outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life using the VascuQol questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical indicators of lower limb function: Ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI),&#xD;
           intermittent claudication distance (ICD), Maximum walking distance (MWD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidate physiological mechanisms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aerobic capacity (VO2 max &amp; AT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Muscular strength and endurance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Muscle morphology (including muscle thickness, pennation angle, fascicle length and&#xD;
           elastography)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endothelial function (sheer stress response as measured by flow mediated dilation)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: Regression analysis will be used to explain variation in patient maximum walking&#xD;
      distance at 3 months. The regression will use 9 candidate measures of physiological response&#xD;
      and 3 baseline measures to explore what mechanism and patient factors may be associated with&#xD;
      clinical improvements. 100 patients recruited over 2 years will give a 90% power to detect an&#xD;
      additional increase in variability in MWD explained by each candidate measure of around 5% at&#xD;
      the a 0.05 significance level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will be used to identify which types of exercise may be most influential in&#xD;
      improving outcome and in which patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Workstream two&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explore the reasons behind patients' participation, non-participation in, experience of and&#xD;
      adherence to the exercise programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: An interview study of patients with IC routinely referred for supervised&#xD;
      exercise. Three groups of patients will be invited to participate. Those who:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Choose not to participate in the exercise programme (Group A)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Agree to participate in the exercise programme (Group B).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Agree to participate but discontinue after at least one session (Group C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Semi-structured face-to-face interviews with 20 patients per group, interviews will be&#xD;
      conducted using a topic guide to ensure consistency. The format will be flexible to allow&#xD;
      participants to generate naturalistic data on what they consider as important and / or&#xD;
      successful in terms of outcome. Data will be analysed thematically and managed using Nvivo&#xD;
      software - the approach will be inductive and iterative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will be used to redesign the current exercise programme to improve&#xD;
      participation and so the impact of exercise in patients with IC.&#xD;
