  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the recommended dose of the study drug&#xD;
      IMO-2125 that can be given in combination with ipilimumab or in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab to patients with metastatic melanoma. Researchers also want to learn if the&#xD;
      study drug combination can help to control the disease. The safety of the drug combination&#xD;
      will also be studied.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase 1/2 study to determine the recommended dose and assess the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, and efficacy of IMO-2125 when&#xD;
      administered in combination with ipilimumab or pembrolizumab. The study will be conducted in&#xD;
      2 parts; a dose-escalation portion (Phase 1) to evaluate safety and tolerability of multiple&#xD;
      dose levels and a Phase 2 portion to assess efficacy.&#xD;
