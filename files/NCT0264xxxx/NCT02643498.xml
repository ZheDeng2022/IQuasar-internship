    <description>Dose limiting toxicities (DLT) are defined by ≥ Grade 3 treatment-related GI toxicity within 3 months of SBRT. These include: (1) Bowel (includes bowel perforation, obstruction, or hemorrhage) and (2) Stomach (bleeding ulcer, perforation). We will employ a standard 3+3 dose-escalation scheme. Patients will be accrued to the study in cohorts of 3.</description>

    <description>Cohorts 1-3 After completion of induction chemotherapy, stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) will be administered in 3 fractions, every other day, on an outpatient basis. Dose escalation will start with dose level 1 (9 Gy x 3 fractions) and increase by 1 Gy per fraction at each dose level, dose level 2 will be 10 Gy x 3 fractions and dose level 3 will be 11 Gy x 3 fractions.&#xD;
Cohorts 4-6 For cohort 4, dose prescription will start at 7 Gy x 6 fractions (42Gy, isoeffective to 11 Gy x 3), followed by 4.8 Gy x 12 (54Gy) and 4.5Gy x 15 (67.5Gy).</description>
