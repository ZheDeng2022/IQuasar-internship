      Investigative trial with aim of&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the description of the hormonal and metabolic response to meals containing different&#xD;
           compositions of macronutrients&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the metabolic response to these test meals in dependance of the hepatic and muscular&#xD;
           insulin sensitivity and abdominal adipose tissue and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. effects of a weight loss on the hormonal response to these test meals containing&#xD;
           different compositions of macronutrients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucagon-like-peptide 1 (GLP-1), Glucose dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) and Ghrelin&#xD;
      response to a nutritive stimulation characterized by different nutritional composition&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  differences of substrate utilization depending on the nutritive composition&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  effects of different hepatic and muscular insulin sensitivity as well as impact of&#xD;
           visceral fat mass on the hormonal and metabolic response&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  effect of weight loss on the hormonal and metabolic response to different test meals&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After primary characterization 50 probands (male and female) will receive 3 different test&#xD;
      meals within a randomised (meal order) controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three different test meals differ in nutritional composition. During consumption of the&#xD;
      test meal a characterization of the endogenous hormonal response and appetite behaviour is&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A nutritional counselling is performed according to the guidelines of the German Nutrition&#xD;
      Society (DGE) to ensure a stable nutritive behaviour in the three days before the test meal&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After analysis of the hormonal response to these 3 different testmeals follows a weight&#xD;
      reduction period over 3 months. Afterwards reevaluation of the probands (again administration&#xD;
      of 3 different test meals over a period of 3 weeks) will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gain of information leading to the understanding of the hormonal regulation of food intake.&#xD;
      The individual variability shall be determined with the aim of an identification of patient&#xD;
      groups which show various intensities of the responses to different macronutrients.&#xD;
