  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the safety and the effectiveness&#xD;
      of using AmnioFix® (dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane, also called dHACM) to help&#xD;
      improve the return of erectile function and bladder control in patients after robotic&#xD;
      assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RARP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      dHACM is a section of tissue made from part of the placenta donated by a mother during a&#xD;
      C-section. It looks like a small piece of tissue paper and is wrapped around the nerve&#xD;
      bundles in the surgical area. The tissue may help the body's normal healing process.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant is eligible and agrees to take part in the study, they will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups. Participant will have an equal chance&#xD;
      of being in either group. This is done because no one knows if one study group is better, the&#xD;
      same, or worse than the other group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participant is in Group 1, they will have RARP with dHACM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participant is in Group 2, they will have RARP alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will not be told which group they are assigned to until they reach the end of the&#xD;
      study. Participant will sign a separate consent form for the surgery that explains the risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant is in Group 1, the dHACM will be wrapped around the nerve bundles at the end&#xD;
      of the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both groups, during the surgery, participant's surgeon may decide that RARP is not&#xD;
      possible. In this case, participant will be taken off the study and dHACM will not be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information will also be collected during participant's surgery, such as details about their&#xD;
      surgery, their hospital stay, and about any side effects that they may have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will visit the study doctor for their standard follow-up visits after surgery at&#xD;
      6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. At these visits, participant will complete the&#xD;
      same questionnaire they completed at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 24 months, participant's medical chart will be reviewed or they will be called on the&#xD;
      phone to learn if the disease came back. If participant is called, the call should last about&#xD;
      5-10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's participation in the study will be over after the 24-month medical chart review or&#xD;
      call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The dHACM is commercially available for use in various&#xD;
      types of surgeries. Its use in prostate surgery to help improve the return of erectile&#xD;
      function and bladder control in patients after RARP is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 100 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;
