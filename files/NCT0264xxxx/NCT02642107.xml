  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, most protocols of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) of various research bodies such&#xD;
      as the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group require routine elective irradiation to the&#xD;
      retropharyngeal area and to levels II-V lymph nodal areas regardless of the status of nodal&#xD;
      metastasis. Previous studies had confirmed that the pattern of cervical lymph node (LN)&#xD;
      metastasis in NPC followed an orderly manner. Retropharyngeal LNs were the most commonly&#xD;
      involved, followed by upper neck levels II, III, or VA nodes, and finally to the lower neck&#xD;
      nodes including level IV and VB nodes; and the incidence of LN skip metastasis is rare,&#xD;
      ranging from 0.5% to 7.9%. It was rare for NPC patients without neck LN metastases to&#xD;
      experience neck failure after elective irradiation to levels II, III and VA. It was also&#xD;
      confirmed that with unilateral LN metastases of higher-level LNs usually spread down&#xD;
      ipsilateral LNs. Thus, the investigators conduct the non-inferior randomized trial to&#xD;
      determine the value of elective neck irradiation in NPC patients with unilateral or bilateral&#xD;
      uninvolved neck.&#xD;
