  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication after cardiac surgery. Its incidence&#xD;
      ranges from 19 to 44% depending on the study and which definition is used: Acute Kidney&#xD;
      Injury Network (AKIN) classification or RIFLE criteria (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss,&#xD;
      End-Stage Kidney Disease) based on serum creatinine and urine output.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AKI is associated with increased mortality, more complications, a longer stay in the&#xD;
      intensive care unit and hospital, and increased health care costs. Moreover, the patients who&#xD;
      require renal replacement therapy (RRT) have the highest mortality and complications1.The&#xD;
      mortality risk in patients developing acute renal dysfunction after cardiac surgery increases&#xD;
      by approximately 40%, while the overall mortality rate after cardiac surgery ranges between&#xD;
      2% and 8%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are some well-known risk factors associated with AKI, including baseline patient&#xD;
      characteristics (age and comorbidities), need of perioperative blood transfusion or presence&#xD;
      of previous chronic kidney disease. The main objective of this study is to evaluate if a&#xD;
      nephrologist management and control of potential risk factors of renal disease can be used to&#xD;
      prevent AKI, thereby minimizing the risk of need RRT, reducing costs and improving survival&#xD;
      in this patients.&#xD;

      Aim The aim of this study is to assess if a nephrology intervention before cardiac surgery&#xD;
      can reduce the postoperative incidence of AKI (Acute Kidney Injury).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Trial design and participants Recruitment: unicentric Ethics approval: Clinical&#xD;
      Research Ethics Committee of Bellvitge will have approved the study before initiation. All&#xD;
      patients will give written informed consent. Patients will be able to withdraw informed&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of the study: 3 years recruitment, 1 year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomly assigned by using sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed&#xD;
      envelopes. Patients will be allocated to one of two groups using shuffled envelopes at the&#xD;
      moment of the first visit of the cardiac surgeon. The two groups will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Nephrology intervention before surgery, which will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. pre-operative study:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Kidney function: creatinine, Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) and presence&#xD;
                     albuminuria or proteinuria. Assessment whether there is a functional component&#xD;
                     added.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Discard presence of renal disease: renovascular disease, glomerular disease,&#xD;
                     toxic ...&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. optimise the patient' s overall condition with a pre-operative strategy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. No nephrology intervention before surgery (standard of care) Treatment allocation will&#xD;
           be know by the clinician entering the patient into the trial at the moment the envelope&#xD;
           will be opened.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding Open study. If it appears a clinical situation that force the clinician to change&#xD;
      the patient allocation group (e.g. acute kidney injury or advanced chronic kidney disease not&#xD;
      known before which requires some treatment), an intention-to-treat analysis will be made&#xD;
      considering the results of the patient in the initial assigned group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Day of randomisation and the day on admission to hospital: serum creatinine, proteinuria&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Type of surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Date of intervention and surgeon&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment before surgery (ACEI, ARA II, non steroid antinflamatories, betablockers,&#xD;
           statins..)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ejection fraction, PAP, diastolic disfunction and left ventricular dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative need of pacemaker&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Euroscore index and index of Charlson&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operative factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  off-pump surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  clamp time (minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  hemodynamic constants (medium arterial pressures)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  fluid balance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  need of blood transfusions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  number of cardioversion Patients will be followed up until they meet the primary&#xD;
           endpoint, or for a minimum of one year if they do not do so. The trial will not formally&#xD;
           be analyzed until 1 year after all patients will have been randomized. Follow-up&#xD;
           information will be obtained from consultant intensivist and consultant nephrologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up: Clinical and analytical assessment will be carried out at discharge, 4 and 12&#xD;
      months after surgery by the cardiac surgeon and nephrologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: The number of participants required in each group is calculated with 80% power&#xD;
      and 5% significance: 9&#xD;
&#xD;
      •n= 550 per group --&gt; considering a difference of 5% in people presenting AKI between people&#xD;
      without nephrologist intervention before surgery (12,2%) and those without intervention&#xD;
      (7,2%)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parameters that will be measured:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The effectiveness of Nephrology intervention will be measured giving a punctuation&#xD;
           according to the degree of attainment of the objectives. An intervention will be&#xD;
           considered effective when a punctuation over 7pt is obtained (adding one point to each&#xD;
           of the parameters).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine laboratory tests (baseline and every day after surgery): creatinine, urea, GFR&#xD;
           (estimated using the CKD-EPI 10, hemoglobin levels (Hb) and diuresis (mL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parameters at initiation of RRT: serum urea (mmol/L) and serum creatinine (μmol/L),&#xD;
           oliguria (defined by urine output &lt;20 mL/h), acidaemia (arterial pH &lt;7.25), K+ (mmol/L),&#xD;
           lactic acid&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of RRT (days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of packed red blood cells, plasma or platelets transfused after the procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ejection fraction and left ventricular dysfunction 13&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vascular access used for RRT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SOFA score&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative day 1 will be defined as the period up to 12pm on the day after surgery, day 2&#xD;
      as the period until 12pm on the subsequent day, and so on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis An intention-to-treat analysis will be performed considering the results&#xD;
      of the patient in the initial assigned group. The outcome data will be measured in all&#xD;
      participants (if there is missing data it will be reported and imputed using appropriate&#xD;
      methods such as: treating these as if they were observed (e.g. last observation carried&#xD;
      forward) Unless otherwise stated, p values and estimates of treatment effects will be based&#xD;
      on two-way comparisons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be compared between groups using Student's t test or Wilcoxon rank&#xD;
      test. Categorical variables will be compared using X2 or Fisher exact test. Subgroup analysis&#xD;
      will be performed considering different stages of previous kidney disease and different kind&#xD;
      of cardiac surgeries. Survival will be analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis using SPSS software will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical issues The trial will be stopped (without one year follow-up) if the in-hospital AKI&#xD;
      outcomes are negative (defining that there is more than 25% of differences between groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has already been approved by the Ethics committee of the Hospital Universitari de&#xD;
      Bellvitge on the 10th of July of 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim analysis and stopping rules The interim analysis will not be published previously and&#xD;
      the stopping rules will be that any patient who do not want to participate in the study, will&#xD;
      be dropped-out without any impediment. There will not be an independent data-monitoring&#xD;
      committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indemnities: none Publication plan: Results will be published in an international journal.&#xD;
      Funder : no funding.&#xD;
