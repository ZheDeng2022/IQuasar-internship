    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I clinical trial evaluating abemaciclib (LY2835219), an inhibitor of cyclin&#xD;
      dependent-kinases 4 and 6 (Cdk 4/6) in children and young adults with newly diagnosed diffuse&#xD;
      intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) (Stratum A) and in relapsed/refractory/progressive malignant&#xD;
      brain (Grade III/IV, including DIPG; MBT) and solid tumor (ST) patients (Stratum B).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stratum A- Appropriate dose RT will be administered in 30-33 fractions over approximately 6&#xD;
      weeks for Stratum A patients. Treatment with abemaciclib (LY2835219) will start on the same&#xD;
      day as radiation therapy (RT) and continue twice daily during and after RT for a maximum&#xD;
      treatment duration of 2 years. Investigators plan to treat a maximum of 4 cohorts of research&#xD;
      participants (dosage levels 1, 2, 3, and 4) with escalating doses of abemaciclib (LY2835219)&#xD;
      starting with dose level 1 (80% of adult dose). A cycle is defined as 28 days and the first 6&#xD;
      weeks of therapy will constitute the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)-evaluation period.&#xD;
      Participants must take abemaciclib by mouth as intact capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratum B - Abemaciclib (LY2835219) will be administered orally on a twice daily basis&#xD;
      continuously for 28 days, which defines one cycle. The maximum treatment duration will be 2&#xD;
      years. Investigators plan to treat a maximum of 4 cohorts of research participants (dosage&#xD;
      levels 1, 2, 3, and 4) with escalating doses of abemaciclib starting with dose level 1 (80%&#xD;
      of adult dose). Dose escalation will be independent of Stratum A escalation. A cycle is&#xD;
      defined as 28 days and the first 4 weeks of therapy will constitute the DLT-evaluation&#xD;
      period. Participants must take abemaciclib by mouth as intact capsules.&#xD;
