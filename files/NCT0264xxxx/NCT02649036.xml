      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inequality in access to healthcare is a challenge internationally. Despite that medical&#xD;
      emergency calls can be considered as access point to pre-hospital emergency care and hospital&#xD;
      admission in emergency situations, no data on inequality in access to healthcare through&#xD;
      emergency calls is reported in the international literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is two-fold:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to evaluate the association between socio-economic characteristics of citizens and&#xD;
           first-time emergency call in the Capital Region of Denmark&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to evaluate the association between socio-economic characteristics of citizens with an&#xD;
           emergency call and the priority level of the response provided by the emergency medical&#xD;
           dispatch center in the Capital Region of Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Observational register based study of adult citizens in the Capital Region of&#xD;
      Denmark. Educational level, household income and employment are used as socioeconomic&#xD;
      indicators. The unique civil registration number will be used to link data from the Emergency&#xD;
      Medical Dispatch Center with data from the Civil Registration System, Danish registers on&#xD;
      personal labor market affiliation, the Danish Populations Education Register, the Danish&#xD;
      Income Statistics Registry and the national patient registry. Logistic regression models will&#xD;
      be used for the association between socio economic indicators and first time emergency calls&#xD;
      and the association between socioeconomic indicators and the priority level of the response&#xD;
      provided.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In prehospital emergency medicine, emergency medical dispatchers play an essential role as&#xD;
      gatekeepers to emergency care from the emergency medical services and possibly hospital&#xD;
      admissions. Dispatching is the task of handling emergency calls in terms of appropriate&#xD;
      triage, delivery of pre-arrival instructions and management of resources to citizens calling&#xD;
      for help. Research within out-of-hospital cardiac arrest has shown that medical dispatchers&#xD;
      can contribute to increased survival, if cardiac arrest is identified through the emergency&#xD;
      call, and telephone assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation is initiated. Optimal performance&#xD;
      in the links of the chain of survival is not only dependent on good performance of healthcare&#xD;
      professionals in the prehospital setting, but also on the persons initiating resuscitation&#xD;
      and calling for help. This is not only true for OHCA but also other life-threatening&#xD;
      situations and the outcome may be affected by the interaction between the person calling for&#xD;
      help and the medical dispatcher responding to the call and providing advice and an adequate&#xD;
      response from the emergency medical services. Research in this area is, however, at an early&#xD;
      stage. Inequality in access to healthcare is a challenge internationally. Despite that&#xD;
      medical emergency calls can be considered as access point to pre-hospital emergency care and&#xD;
      hospital admission in emergency situations, no data on inequality in access to healthcare&#xD;
      through emergency calls is reported in the international literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is two-fold:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the association between socio-economic characteristics of citizens and&#xD;
           first-time emergency call in the Capital Region of Denmark&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the association between socio-economic characteristics of citizens with an&#xD;
           emergency call and the emergency response provided by the emergency medical dispatch&#xD;
           center in the Capital Region of Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Low socioeconomic position (measured by educational level, employment, household income&#xD;
           as social indicators) is associated with a high incidence of emergency calls, compared&#xD;
           to high socioeconomic position.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Within the most common medical contact causes (chest pain, intoxication, breathing&#xD;
           difficulties, abdominal pain/back pain, altered level of consciousness, seizures and&#xD;
           unconscious/lifeless adult), low socioeconomic position (measured by educational level,&#xD;
           employment, household income as indicators) is associated with a lower level of&#xD;
           emergency response, compared to high socioeconomic position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is an investigation of the population in the Capital Region of Denmark performed by&#xD;
      combining data from the Emergency Medical Services and Danish central registries in a&#xD;
      two-year period (December 2011-November 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is based on data from the Capital Region of Denmark with a population of 1.8&#xD;
      million. In Denmark, healthcare services are covered by income taxes. In case of an&#xD;
      emergency, there is a single emergency phone number (1-1-2) to a call center that identifies&#xD;
      the need for police, fire or medical assistance. In case of a medical problem, the caller is&#xD;
      re-directed to an Emergency Medical Dispatch Center where medical dispatchers answer, process&#xD;
      and respond to the call by activating the appropriate Emergency Medical Services. The medical&#xD;
      dispatchers are specially trained nurses or paramedics with experience within emergency&#xD;
      medicine. Their decision-making process is supported by a criteria-based, nationwide&#xD;
      Emergency Medical Dispatch System (Danish Index for Emergency Care), which is a validated&#xD;
      tool for managing emergency calls for the most urgent cases of emergencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis, study part 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Logistic regression models will be used with emergency call as outcome variable (yes/no)&#xD;
      and socioeconomic indicators as explanatory variables, calculating odds ratios for the&#xD;
      probability of a first-time emergency call for each socioeconomic indicator. The analysis&#xD;
      will be performed unadjusted and adjusted for age, gender, civil status, country of origin,&#xD;
      and comorbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis, study part 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ordinal logistic regression models will be used with emergency response as outcome&#xD;
           variable (four levels) and socioeconomic indicators as explanatory variables to&#xD;
           calculate the probability of each emergency response. The analysis will be performed&#xD;
           unadjusted and adjusted for age, gender, civil status, country of origin and&#xD;
           comorbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The analysis will primarily be performed as complete case analysis and secondarily as a&#xD;
           weighted analysis according to the proportion of missing personal identification numbers&#xD;
           within each response type in the original dataset.&#xD;
