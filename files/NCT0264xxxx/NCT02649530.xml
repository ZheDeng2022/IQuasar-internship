  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given that up-regulation of the Wnt pathway has been identified as having a significant role&#xD;
      in carcinogenesis in advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, the investigator&#xD;
      believes that inhibition of Porcupine via WNT974 will result in tumor control hence&#xD;
      improvement in disease free and overall survival in these patients with a tolerable toxicity&#xD;
      profile. As suggested by pre-clinical models, patients with a tumor harboring a Notch&#xD;
      receptor (any of the four) loss of function mutation may have a greater response rate to&#xD;
      treatment with WNT974. The investigator aims to address this question by administration of&#xD;
      single agent WNT974 and following response radiologically along with close clinical follow up&#xD;
      to monitor toxicities.&#xD;
