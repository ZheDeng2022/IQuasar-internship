  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers in Taiwan, where chronic&#xD;
      viral hepatitis is common. Patients with HCC typically have impaired liver function because&#xD;
      of virus- or alcohol- induced cirrhosis and viral hepatitis, and only approximately 20% of&#xD;
      them are appropriate candidates for surgery. The 5-year overall survival for patients treated&#xD;
      by surgery is approximately 30%-70%. For those not treated with surgery, liver function&#xD;
      affected by an underlying liver disease has a strong influence on clinical outcomes, and&#xD;
      complicates treatment strategies further than for other tumors. Maximal preservation of&#xD;
      normal liver volume and function is an important consideration in the choice of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proton beam has been applied to HCC treatment in Japan for longer than a decade, and several&#xD;
      retrospective results showed excellent 3-5 years local control rate ranging from 85-95% and&#xD;
      nearly no major complications. The investigators also retrospectively reviewed 75 index&#xD;
      tumors sized 3.1-7.0cm in 70 patients receiving multiple-electrode radiofrequency ablation&#xD;
      with switching controller (ME-SWC RFA) treatments in the period between 1 January 2009 and 31&#xD;
      December 2011 (Oral report in Taiwan Digestive Disease Week, October, 2012). Estimated 1-,&#xD;
      2-, and 3-year cumulative overall survival rates and local control rates were 94%, 85%, 81%&#xD;
      and 89%, 83%, 67%, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since ME-SWC RFA is the present one of standard modalities for non-surgery, moderate to&#xD;
      larger (3-7 cm) HCC, and based on retrospective studies the local control rate of proton&#xD;
      therapy was better than radiofrequency ablation, this prospective trial is aimed to compare&#xD;
      the effects of these two modalities in 3-7 cm HCC patients who are not candidates for surgery&#xD;
      or refuse surgery. This prospective study has high possibility to confirm the role of proton&#xD;
      beam in HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Along with the clinical trial, the investigators will also use next generation sequencing&#xD;
      (NGS) to exam gene expression profile of tumor samples and find out candidate genes related&#xD;
      to local control, intrahepatic control (treatment out-field control in liver), regional lymph&#xD;
      node relapse, distant metastasis, and treatment response in HCC.&#xD;

    <description>Multiple-electrode radiofrequency with switch-controller system (ME-SWC RFA) can create a large coagulation necrosis volume and successful treat HCC sized more than 3 cm, extending to 8.5 cm. ME-SWC RFA system uses up to 3 electrodes parallel insertion to inside of the tumors with an equilateral triangular confirmation before initiation of ablation. The distances between electrodes are about 1.5-2 cm, estimated by ultrasound measuring. The switching machine is set on the auto-mode, and all electrodes work alternately and switching each other automatically after impendence surge.</description>
