  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the proof of concept of efficacy of ustekinumab in&#xD;
      subjects with Behçet disease, including patients with oral ulcers (STELABEC-1) and patients&#xD;
      with active posterior uveitis or panuveitis (STELABEC-2)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Behçet disease (BD) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disorder at the crossroad between&#xD;
      autoimmune and autoinflammatory syndromes. Two recent large genome-wide association studies&#xD;
      (GWAS) conducted in Turkey and Japan reported association between single nucleotide&#xD;
      polymorphism (SNP) of interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-23R/IL-12RB2 genes and BD. Interleukin-12&#xD;
      and interleukin-23, cytokines that induce naive CD4+ lymphocytes to differentiate into type 1&#xD;
      helper T cells (Th1 cells) and type 17 helper T cells (Th17 cells), respectively, have been&#xD;
      identified as key mediators of BD. Promotion of Th1 and Th17 responses and suppression of&#xD;
      regulatory T cells correlate with BD activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the lack of an etiologic agent, the treatment is symptomatic without consensus. The&#xD;
      goals are the functional recovery of a visceral involvement (eye, central nervous system) and&#xD;
      prevention of relapse(s). The risks of BD are an increased mortality especially in case of&#xD;
      arterial involvement, and a high morbidity due to the cumulative sequelae of ocular and&#xD;
      neurological involvement. Steroids are the corner stone of the antiinflammatory agents&#xD;
      administered topically or systemically. Relapses are frequently seen after discontinuation of&#xD;
      steroids, and corticodependence is frequently observed leading to the use of&#xD;
      immunosuppressive drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biologic agents that selectively block steps in the inflammatory cascade could provide&#xD;
      additional therapies for BD.&#xD;
