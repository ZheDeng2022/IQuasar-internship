  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is for participants who are undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation (HSCT) and are at risk for developing acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).&#xD;
      GVHD is a complication of HSCT in which immune cells from the donor cause inflammation and&#xD;
      injury to tissues and organs of the HSCT recipient. Vancomycin-polymyxin B (commonly called&#xD;
      &quot;vancopoly&quot;) is an oral antibiotic that is given to people undergoing allogeneic HSCT as a&#xD;
      preventive measure for acute GVHD. This research study is studying the effects of vancopoly&#xD;
      on the microorganisms living in the intestine during and after stem cell transplantation.&#xD;

      This research study is a Phase 2 clinical trial. Phase 2 clinical trials test the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in&#xD;
      treating a specific disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-clinical studies performed in the 1970's showed that killing all the bacteria in the&#xD;
      intestine with oral antibiotics could decrease the risk of acute GVHD following allogeneic&#xD;
      HSCT. Based on this observation, many stem cell transplant centers adopted the practice of&#xD;
      &quot;gut decontamination&quot; with oral antibiotics as a preventive measure for acute GVHD. There is&#xD;
      no standard regimen for gut decontamination between transplant centers, and there are no&#xD;
      definitive human studies showing that gut decontamination is beneficial for lowering the risk&#xD;
      of acute GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies in adult patients undergoing stem cell transplant indicate that the types of&#xD;
      bacteria living in the intestine can influence bone marrow transplant outcomes such as&#xD;
      survival and development of acute GVHD. Some types of bacteria may be protective against GVHD&#xD;
      and others may increase the risk of GVHD. Based on this newer research, it is possible that&#xD;
      the practice of gut decontamination (&quot;vancopolys&quot;) may not be beneficial for HSCT patients.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligibility Criteria for Patients Undergoing Allogeneic HSCT&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Recipient of 9/10 or 10/10 (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQB1) matched bone marrow&#xD;
                  allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) OR 4/6, 5/6 and 6/6&#xD;
                  (HLA-A, -B, -DR) matched cord blood allogeneic HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants may have underlying malignant or non-malignant hematologic disease,&#xD;
                  except for primary immunodeficiency, as the indication for their allogeneic HSCT.&#xD;
                  Patients with immune dysregulation such as familial or secondary hemophagocytic&#xD;
                  lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants must may receive either a myeloablative or&#xD;
                  non-myeloablative(reduced-intensity) conditioning regimen. Anti-thymocyte&#xD;
                  globulin (ATG) in the conditioning regimen is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis with any of the following agents:&#xD;
                  calcineurin inhibitor, and short-course methotrexate, with or without steroids,&#xD;
                  mycophenolate mofetil, and sirolimus.&#xD;

               -  Age ≥ 4 years old and toilet-trained. Participants must be able to deposit stool&#xD;
                  samples directly into stool collection containers. Stool specimens from diapers&#xD;
                  are difficult to obtain and are prone to more sampling error, particularly for&#xD;
                  loose or liquid stools which are common in the peri-transplant period.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Lansky/Karnofsky performance status ≥60% (see Appendix A)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Ability to understand and/or the willingness of their parent or legally&#xD;
                  authorized representative to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligibility Criteria for Healthy Bone Marrow Donors&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Healthy individuals, ages ≥ 4 years and toilet-trained, who have been identified&#xD;
                  by BCH or DFCI providers as 9/10 or 10/10 (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQB1 matched&#xD;
                  bone marrow donors for transplantation will also be eligible to participate in&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT for correction of a primary immunodeficiency&#xD;
             disorder (e.g. SCID).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with age ≤ 10 years undergoing HSCT with a matched sibling donor. These&#xD;
             patients are at very low risk of acute GVHD and do not receive gut decontamination per&#xD;
             our institutional standard practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants receiving GVHD prophylaxis with drugs other than calcineurin inhibitors,&#xD;
             methotrexate or steroids.agents listed above (e.g. abatacept).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to oral vancomycin or oral polymyxin B.&#xD;
&#xD;

             bacterial prophylaxis upon admission for allogeneic HSCT. Use of any agent (e.g.&#xD;
             sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim) for prophylaxis of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia is&#xD;
             permitted. Concurrent use of anti-fungal and anti-viral therapies is also permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
