  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is the loss of more than 500ml of blood within 24 hours after&#xD;
      delivery. It is a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality across the globe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxytocin is a naturally-occurring hormone that causes the uterus to contract, thereby causing&#xD;
      labor. A synthetic form of oxytocin is used in obstetric medicine in the same way. It causes&#xD;
      the uterus to contract by acting at the oxytocin receptor (OTR). It is used for both the&#xD;
      prevention and the treatment of PPH. By causing the uterus to contract, it constricts the&#xD;
      blood vessels within it, thus reducing bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxytocin is also used to augment labor in women with slow labor progression. Desensitization&#xD;
      of the OTR after prolonged exposure to oxytocin occurs, leading to reduced contractions of&#xD;
      the uterus with the same doses of oxytocin. This has been demonstrated in previous studies&#xD;
      done by the investigators. The resultant need for a higher oxytocin dose to cause adequate&#xD;
      uterine contraction has also been demonstrated in laboring women having received oxytocin for&#xD;
      labor augmentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnesium sulphate (MgSO4) is widely used within obstetric medicine. It is used for seizure&#xD;
      prevention and treatment in preeclampsia and eclampsia, and is used for fetal neuroprotection&#xD;
      in preterm labor, to reduce the risk of cerebral palsy. It is well-known to have a relaxant&#xD;
      effect on uterine muscle, and as such, has been used as a tocolytic agent in preterm labour&#xD;
      to prevent premature contractions and premature delivery. The effect of MgSO4 on contractions&#xD;
      in oxytocin pre-treated myometrium has not been fully elucidated with human lab studies.&#xD;
      There are suggestions it may lead to increased oxytocin requirements or increased postpartum&#xD;
      hemorrhage (PPH) in preeclamptic patients. This bears significance in the preeclamptic and&#xD;
      eclamptic populations who are likely to be receiving MgSO4 in combination with oxytocin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that MgSO4 will reduce uterine contractions in oxytocin&#xD;
      pre-treated myometrium, as well as untreated myometrium, and higher oxytocin doses will be&#xD;
      needed to produce equivalent contractions. This will help us to better understand the&#xD;
      implications of the use of these drugs together in the clinical setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MgSO4 is known to cause relaxation of uterine muscle in the doses used for preeclampsia and&#xD;
      eclampsia and fetal neuroprotection. In these clinical settings, after delivery, oxytocin is&#xD;
      often given to prevent or treat PPH. There is evidence that patients with preeclampsia&#xD;
      already have a higher risk of PPH than non-preeclamptic patients. In the presence of the&#xD;
      effects of MgSO4 treatment on the uterus, PPH could be worse in theory. If patients have had&#xD;
      oxytocin-augmented labor, then the desensitization effect on the uterus also comes into play.&#xD;
      Performing this study in vitro will allow us to assess the effects on the uterine muscle of&#xD;
      MgSO4 in oxytocin-desensitized tissue samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific evidence on pregnancy outcomes in these patients is timely and important. A study&#xD;
      of myometrial contractility under controlled conditions is likely to provide us with&#xD;
      information on the interactions between oxytocin and MgSO4 that occurs in many clinical&#xD;
      scenarios, eliminating any confounders that could be encountered in clinical settings. The&#xD;
      investigators hope to determine the myometrial contraction patterns induced by oxytocin in&#xD;
      the presence of MgSO4, including in myometrial specimens pre-treated with oxytocin plus&#xD;
      MgSO4, to mimic the clinical scenarios in preeclampsia and fetal neuroprotection. This will&#xD;
      expand the depth of our understanding of the desensitization phenomenon, and could provide&#xD;
      valuable insight into the mechanism responsible for PPH in these patient populations. This&#xD;
      study will form a basis for future modifications in oxytocin augmentation regimens and&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy for control of uterine atony and PPH in these patient populations being&#xD;
      simultaneously treated with MgSO4.&#xD;
