  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is increasingly recognized as a significant public health issue,&#xD;
      but the most effective rehabilitation methods have yet to be identified. The Institute of&#xD;
      Medicine and the Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research sponsored systematic reviews of&#xD;
      evidence for comparative effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions for TBI. Both reviews&#xD;
      concluded that substantially more research is needed to identify interventions best suited&#xD;
      for different individuals. The practice-based evidence (PBE) approach employed to create the&#xD;
      data used in the proposed study was a research method recommended to provide greater clarity,&#xD;
      along with use of patient-centered outcomes obtained over a longer period of time than used&#xD;
      in previous studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following specific aims will be addressed in the proposed study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the comparative effectiveness of different therapeutic approaches used in&#xD;
           inpatient TBI rehabilitation after statistically adjusting for patient need and ability&#xD;
           to benefit from various approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Investigators hypothesize:&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1. Patients who receive a greater proportion of therapy time in Advanced Training&#xD;
           (versus Standard of Care) will achieve better outcomes than similar patients who receive&#xD;
           a lesser proportion of treatment time in Advanced Training.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2. Patients with the greatest initial levels of disability will experience larger&#xD;
           effects from Advanced Training therapeutic approaches in comparison to the effects&#xD;
           experienced by patients with less disability at admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3. Patients who receive a greater proportion of therapy in contextualized treatment&#xD;
           (versus decontextualized) will achieve better outcomes than similar patients who receive&#xD;
           a lesser proportion of time in contextualized treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the comparative effectiveness of difference in the delivery of inpatient&#xD;
           rehabilitation therapies, after statistically adjusting for patient need and ability to&#xD;
           benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 The level of effort that patients are able to apply in treatment moderates the&#xD;
      effectiveness of time in treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Family involvement in treatment is associated with better outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be drawn from the database established for the TBI Practice-Based Evidence Study&#xD;
      (TBI-PBE Study). Data on 2130 persons who received inpatient TBI rehabilitation at any of 10&#xD;
      sites (9 in US, 1 in Canada) were obtained for the study. Detailed longitudinal data were&#xD;
      collected prospectively on rehabilitation therapies (with point of care data completed for&#xD;
      every clinical encounter), course of recovery, person and injury characteristics and outcomes&#xD;
      during and after rehabilitation. Advanced analytic methods (e.g. propensity scores,&#xD;
      generalized linear mixed models) will be used to compare the effects of different&#xD;
      rehabilitation interventions on outcomes at discharge and during the 9 months following&#xD;
      rehabilitation.&#xD;
