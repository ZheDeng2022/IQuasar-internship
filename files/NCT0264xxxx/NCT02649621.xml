  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Corneal epithelial cells and limbal stem cells (LSC) are located in the limbus basal&#xD;
      epithelium that are necessary for repair of corneal. About patients with deficient or absence&#xD;
      of this area has been proposed various treatments such as limbal stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective clinical trial to compare the improvement of limbal stem cell&#xD;
      deficiency (LSCD) in vivo by using of Amniotic Membrane Extract Eye Drop (AMEED).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The cornea is the eye anterior portion which its refractive power and transparent is&#xD;
      essential for normal vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The damaged cornea surface can reduce vision and leads to blindness, ultimately. Corneal&#xD;
      epithelial and some times, limbal stem cell (LSC) are involved in corneal injuries. Limbal&#xD;
      stem cells (LSC) are necessary for repair and reconstruction of corneal that reduction of&#xD;
      these cells occurs by various causes including congenital causes, eye inflammatory diseases&#xD;
      and burns. For cornea stem cell damages or limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD), cornea becomes&#xD;
      conjunctivalization. LSCD may involve one eye (unilateral) or two eyes (bilateral).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to autologous transplantation problems in patients with unilateral LSCD and recent&#xD;
      successes to resolve this problem, it seems that transplantation of cultured corneal stem&#xD;
      cells on amniotic membrane is other way in treatment of unilateral LSCD. It is called ex&#xD;
      vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amniotic membrane can modulate corneal epithelium healing by promoting re-epithelialization&#xD;
      and migration of limbal stem cell while suppressing stromal inflammation, angiogenesis and&#xD;
      scarring. It is well accepted that amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT) as a temporary&#xD;
      patch normally dissolves within 2 weeks. Consequent reapplication of membrane is difficult&#xD;
      for the patient. On the other hand, in ex vivo, corneal tissue from healthy eye must be&#xD;
      transported to laboratory for cell culture on AM that is required equipment. There is, also,&#xD;
      a risk of cell infection and transmission that is very important issue. However, in infected&#xD;
      cells, re-biopsy of the healthy eye is required that is uncomfortable and difficult for the&#xD;
      patient. Other studies have been reported that amniotic membrane extract (AME) has same&#xD;
      characteristics and features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We previously have reported an effective potential of AMEED in limbal stem cell proliferation&#xD;
      in vitro and also rabbit corneal epithelium healing in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective clinical trial to use Amniotic Membrane Extract Eye Drop (AMEED)&#xD;
      on in vivo cultured limbal stem cells in the treatment of unilateral corneal stem cell&#xD;
      damage.&#xD;
