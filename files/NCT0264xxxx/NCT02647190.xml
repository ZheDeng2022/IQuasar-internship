  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of Erwinia Chrysanthemi asparaginase when&#xD;
      used alone and together with chemotherapy and find out what effects, if any, it has on&#xD;
      people.&#xD;

      The study consists of three treatment phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Steroid prophase (days -3 to -1):&#xD;
&#xD;
           To prevent rapid leukemia progression and reduce tumor load, patients will receive&#xD;
           either prednisone 60mg/m2 oral daily or equivalent corticosteroid daily for 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Asparaginase phase (days 1 - 14):&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will receive Erwinia asparaginase 25,000 IU/m2 IV three times a week on a&#xD;
           Monday, Wednesday, Friday (MWF) schedule for 2 weeks. Patients are permitted to begin&#xD;
           Erwinia asparaginase on Monday, Wednesday, or Friday, so that their schedules are&#xD;
           defined as MWF, WFM, or FMW. For rapid progression of disease (defined by rising WBC&#xD;
           &gt;30K with &gt; 50% peripheral blasts), prednisone 60mg/m2 oral daily or equivalent&#xD;
           corticosteroid daily may be added.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy will be performed on days 13-15 of the asparaginase&#xD;
           treatment for early disease response assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Chemotherapy phase (days 15 - 42):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cyclophosphamide 650 mg/m2 IV on day 15&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 (max 2mg) IV on days 15, 22, 29, and 36&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Prednisone 60mg/m2 (or equivalent corticosteroid) oral daily for 28 days on days 15&#xD;
                - 42&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Erwinia asparaginase 25,000 IU/m2 IV three times a week on a MWF schedule for 2&#xD;
                weeks on days 29 - 42 (after a two week interval without Erwinia asparaginase&#xD;
                administered on days 1 - 14) Upon cell count recovery, a bone marrow aspirate&#xD;
                and/or biopsy will be performed to assess the disease response. Subsequent&#xD;
                treatments following the bone marrow evaluation will be left up to the discretion&#xD;
                of the treating physicians. If the first 6 patients have no response or progress&#xD;
                during the 2 weeks of asparaginase phase of treatment with or without steroid, the&#xD;
                next 6 patients will start directly with the chemotherapy phase (days 15-42) of&#xD;
                treatment consisting of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone with Erwinia&#xD;
                asparaginase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CNS prophylaxis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IT methotrexate 12mg (flat dose) between days 15 - 22&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IT methotrexate 12mg (flat dose) between days 22- 29&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There will be a minimal interval between doses of 7 days&#xD;
