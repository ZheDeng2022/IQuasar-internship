      Aflibercept (Eylea®) and ranibizumab (Lucentis®) are an anti-VEGF, but there are differences&#xD;
      between the two drugs. Lucentis is administered in the form of smaller molecules, which is&#xD;
      thought to give Lucentis an advantage over Eylea in its ability to penetrate the eye's retina&#xD;
      and halt abnormal blood vessel growth contributing to advanced macular degeneration and&#xD;
      scarring that causes blindness. They may have a role in treating ocular disorders involving&#xD;
      fibrovascular proliferation. To determine and compare whether intraocular aflibercept and&#xD;
      ranibizumab decreases rubeosis iridis (RI) in patients with neovascular glaucoma (NVG).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to provide written informed consent and comply with study assessments for the&#xD;
             full duration of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ischemic central retina vein occlusion (CRVO) within 3 months of enrollment as per the&#xD;
             following inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Three of the following clinical tests must be present to demonstrate ischemic CRVO&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Visual Acuity 20/200 or worse&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Loss of 1-2e isopter on Goldmann Visual field (Kwon et al. 2001)&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
