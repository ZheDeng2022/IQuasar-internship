  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      4CMenB was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States in January&#xD;
      2015 for people aged 10 through 25 years of age. 4CMenB should be used during pregnancy only&#xD;
      if clearly needed and sometimes, inadvertent exposure during pregnancy may also occur -&#xD;
      before the woman knows she is pregnant, for example. The objective of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety of 4CMenB during pregnancy and to help us learn more about the health of&#xD;
      women who have been vaccinated with 4CMenB within 30 days prior to their last menstrual&#xD;
      period (LMP) or at any time during pregnancy, and the health of their infants. Pregnant women&#xD;
      within the US who received at least 1 dose 4CMenB vaccine within 30 days prior to their last&#xD;
      menstrual period or at any time during pregnancy are eligible to participate. A woman may&#xD;
      self-enroll in the registry by calling the pregnancy registry telephone number directly or&#xD;
      their healthcare provider (HCP) can, with their consent, enroll them on their behalf.&#xD;
      Alternatively HCPs may report anonymous data on pregnancy exposures and outcomes occurring&#xD;
      within their network/health maintenance organization (HMO). The health of the woman and her&#xD;
      infant will be followed up until the end of the pregnancy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any pregnant women within the US who received at least 1 dose 4CMenB vaccine within 30 days&#xD;
        prior to LMP or at any time during pregnancy where:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sufficient evidence to confirm that exposure to a meningococcal B vaccine (confirmed&#xD;
             or possible 4CMenB exposure) occurred within 30 days prior to LMP or at any time&#xD;
             during pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sufficient information to determine whether the pregnancy is prospectively or&#xD;
             retrospectively registered (i.e., whether the outcome of pregnancy was known at the&#xD;
             time of first contact with the registry)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Date the pregnancy exposure is registered&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Full reporter (i.e., HCP) contact information to allow for follow-up (name, address,&#xD;
             etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant women vaccinated with a different brand of Meningococcal B vaccine will not be&#xD;
        included. (Of note: In the event that it cannot be ascertained to which meningococcal B&#xD;
        vaccine the woman was exposed, an unknown exposure cohort will be established and analyzed&#xD;
        separately).&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>At the end of recruitment of this pregnancy registry for Bexsero, there were only 2 registrations. Of these,1 subject withdrew the consent and the other subject did not return for a follow up, hence considered as lost to follow up. Therefore, no pregnancy outcome data are available for this study.</recruitment_details>
