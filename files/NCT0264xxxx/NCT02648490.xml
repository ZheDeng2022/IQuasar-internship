      This study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose&#xD;
      (RP2D) of humanized anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, HLX07, in patients with epithelial cancer&#xD;
      who have failed standard therapy and deemed unamenable by conventional therapy. This study&#xD;
      will also evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity and anti-tumor&#xD;
      effect of HLX07 and explore the potential prognostic and predictive biomarkers.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The role of EGFR in carcinogenesis led to the development and extensive evaluation of&#xD;
      EGFR-blocking agents for cancer treatment. Two EGFR-targeted approaches have been explored:&#xD;
      (a) small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting the intracellular EGFR tyrosine&#xD;
      kinase domain and (b). mAbs targeting the EGFR extra-cellular domain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been widely used in lung cancer with EGFR&#xD;
      mutations. However, the results of using small molecule inhibitors for cancer with&#xD;
      overexpressed wildtype EGFR have been unsatisfactory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The best-studied of the anti-EGFR mAbs in cancer is cetuximab (Erbitux®), and panitumumab&#xD;
      (Vectibix®). Necitumumab, another humanized anti-EGFR mAb is currently under investigation is&#xD;
      multiple cancers. Both cetuximab and panitumumab have been approved in colorectal cancer and&#xD;
      head/neck cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cetuximab is chimeric human-murine IgG1 mAb, and blocks ligand binding to EGFR, thereby&#xD;
      diminishing receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation and inducing EGFR downregulation.&#xD;
      The immunoglobulin IgG1 isotype of cetuximab may also engage hose immune functions such as&#xD;
      antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Cetuximab is approved to be used in&#xD;
      combination with chemotherapy and has been shown to improve the survival of patients with&#xD;
      advanced colorectal cancer. Cetuximab, when used in combination with radiotherapy has also&#xD;
      improved response rate in patients with locally advanced head/neck cancer. However, the use&#xD;
      of cetuximab has been associated with rare anaphylactic reactions, which is likely to be&#xD;
      related to the specific glycosylation in the molecules and possibly its mouse/human chimeric&#xD;
      structure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Panitumumab is a human IgG2 mAb that targets EGFR. But unlike cetuximab, it mediates its&#xD;
      effects through mechanisms other than ADCC, which has a different binding site on EGFR&#xD;
      extracellular domain from that of cetuximab, is also approved for colorectal cancer and&#xD;
      head/neck cancer. However, the side effects, especially skin reactions, is more pronounced in&#xD;
      patients receiving panitumumab, which also limiting its clinical use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although cetuximab and panitumumab target EGFR, clinical studies of cetuximab and panitumumab&#xD;
      have shown that the levels of EGFR expression in cancer cells do not affect the efficacy of&#xD;
      the drug.So far there is unclear why it is so. However, several retrospective studies have&#xD;
      shown that the presence of K-ras, and B-raf mutations predicts the poor response to either&#xD;
      cetuximab or panitumumab. Likewise, there is no clear answer for such phenomenon. Therefore,&#xD;
      in this study, the investigators will examine the expression of EGFR in the cancer cells of&#xD;
      enrolled patients, but will not use its expression for enrollment. But, in this study, the&#xD;
      investigators will exclude patients whose cancer cells harbor either K-ras, or B-raf&#xD;
      mutations, since the investigators in vivo study also demonstrated that HLX07 is not&#xD;
      effective in cancer cells with K-ras mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HLX07 is an improved version of anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody. There are several important&#xD;
      improvements in the development of HLX07. First, the investigators re-engineered the Fab&#xD;
      portion of the antibody to modify the glycosylation pattern of this antibody- to make less&#xD;
      immunogenic and have better binding affinity. Second, the investigators produced an antibody&#xD;
      using CHO cell system, which lead to cleaner glycosylation profile and better yield.&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators expect that the results can provide a better and more affordable&#xD;
      option for patients with advanced cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators in vitro and in vivo animal studies have demonstrated that the anti-cancer&#xD;
      effect of HLX07 at the same dose level is either equal or superior to those of cetuximab. In&#xD;
      the toxicokinetic studies on monkey, the toxicity profile of HLX07 was better than that of&#xD;
      cetuximab. Therefore, the investigators are confident that HLX07 will be a better solution&#xD;
      for patients who benefit from anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, HLX07 has not been tested in human yet. Therefore, the investigators propose this&#xD;
      first-in-human phase 1 study. In this study, the investigators intend to investigate the&#xD;
      safety, and tolerability of HLX07 in humans, and hope to identify the maximum tolerated dose,&#xD;
      and determine the recommended phase 2 dose in future study. At the same time, the&#xD;
      investigators would like to gain information of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of&#xD;
      this drug and its potential immunogenicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To minimize the risk of patients who volunteer to receive this experimental drug, the&#xD;
      investigators will choose 50 mg flat dose as the initial starting dose. The selection of&#xD;
      starting dose is based on the repeat-dose toxicology study on monkey. In the 3-month&#xD;
      repeat-dose study, the highest non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD) is weekly 60 mg/kg. The human&#xD;
      equivalent dose for this HNSTD is 20 mg/kg. One-sixth of 20 mg/kg in an adult of 70 kilogram&#xD;
      is 233 mg. In order to provide sufficient safety factor in the FIH study, the investigators&#xD;
      will select 50 mg flat dose as the starting dose in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the dose required to reach maximal effect, the investigators propose a dose&#xD;
      escalation sequence. The purpose of the dose escalation is to obtain the pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of HLX07 at different dose levels, and investigate its relationship with&#xD;
      adverse reactions. Also, the investigators intend to identify the MTD and determine the dose&#xD;
      required to reach 90% saturation of clearance. The information from the dose escalation is&#xD;
      crucial to determine the optimal dose in future studies and potential indications for HLX07.&#xD;
