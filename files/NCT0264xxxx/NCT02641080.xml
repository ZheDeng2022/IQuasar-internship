      For patients undergoing total hip and knee arthroplasty, does the use of Aspirin alone&#xD;
      compared to using Aspirin along with a mobile compression device provide equivocal results&#xD;
      for preventing Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) after total joint&#xD;
      arthroplasty? The investigator will evaluate the prevention of DVT/PE after total hip and&#xD;
      knee arthroplasty will be evaluated to see if there is a decreased risk of bleeding while&#xD;
      continuing to prevent thromboembolic disease. The equivalency of using the mobile compression&#xD;
      devices with aspirin compared to aspirin alone in patients undergoing total hip and knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty will be evaluated. A previous study has shown that patient compliance with the&#xD;
      pneumatic compression device is less than 80%.&#xD;

      The research question is: does the use of Aspirin alone compared to using Aspirin along with&#xD;
      a mobile compression device provide equivocal results for preventing Deep Vein Thrombosis&#xD;
      (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) after total joint arthroplasty? Participants were&#xD;
      randomized to either receive aspirin and mobile pneumatic compression devices or aspirin&#xD;
      alone as outpatient DVT prophylaxis as their standard of care after primary total hip and&#xD;
      total knee arthroplasty. Participants randomized to the compression device group were asked&#xD;
      to wear the compression devices for 20 hours a day for 2 weeks along with taking an aspirin&#xD;
      (325mg once a day), per standard of care. Participants randomized to aspirin alone took 325&#xD;
      mg per day. Participant usage information from Active Care +S.F.T. mobile devices was&#xD;
      collected. The information was recorded at the participant's first follow up visit occurring&#xD;
      between 7-21 days post-surgery. All of the participants were asked to keep a checklist&#xD;
      indicating aspirin intake compliance each day, which was returned at their first follow up&#xD;
      visit. Participants randomized to mobile pneumatic compression device and aspirin (325 mg)&#xD;
      were asked to complete a satisfaction questionnaire about the compression device at their&#xD;
      first follow up visit. Participants received a phone call from a member of the research team&#xD;
      approximately 90 days post-op. The call was necessary to assess if any participants have been&#xD;
      diagnosed with DVT at another hospital.&#xD;
