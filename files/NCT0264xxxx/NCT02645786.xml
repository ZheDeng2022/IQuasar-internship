  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the cardiac effects of TSH over-suppression in women&#xD;
      with DTC during TSH suppressive therapy for 5 to 9 years relative to their risk of&#xD;
      recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
           From chart review, the investigators selected 96 female differentiated thyroid cancer&#xD;
           patients who received total- or near-total thyroidectomy, and thereafter regularly&#xD;
           visited the endocrine out-patient department (OPD) of Chuncheon Sacred Heart Hospital.&#xD;
           Majority of papillary thyroid cancer tends to present between 30 and 50 years old and&#xD;
           their risk of recurrence is low or intermediate. Menopause also might affect on the&#xD;
           cardiovascular risk factors in women. According to guidelines, the dose of thyroxine&#xD;
           would be reduced after 10 years of thyroidectomy in DTC patients. Therefore, additional&#xD;
           enrollment criteria were as follows: 1) age less than 45 years old when receiving total&#xD;
           or near-total thyroidectomy, 2) serum level of TSH&lt;0.1 mU/L in the intermediate -risk or&#xD;
           TSH&lt;0.3 mU/L in the low recurrence-risk group, over 2 years before study entry, 3)&#xD;
           receiving TSH suppressive therapy for 5 to 9 years with fixed dose of LT4 more than 2&#xD;
           years before study entry, and 4) no history of structural heart disease, arrhythmia, or&#xD;
           cardiac symptoms (palpitation, exertional dyspnea and chest discomfort) during therapy.&#xD;
           Of the 17 patients who met the criteria, three patients did not consent to this study.&#xD;
           Candidates who satisfied all the enrollment criteria took an electrocardiogram to rule&#xD;
           out patients with arrhythmia. Finally, 14 DTC patients were enrolled and studied from&#xD;
           September 2009 to March 2010. As each patient was enrolled, control subjects were&#xD;
           selected from patients who visited endocrinology department for thyroid nodule work-up.&#xD;
           The control group had to meet the following criteria: 1) the subject matched to a&#xD;
           patient by age (±2 years), sex, and body mass index (BMI) (±2 kg/m2), 2) within the&#xD;
           reference range of serum TSH (0.3-4.6 mU/L), 3) no history of structural heart disease,&#xD;
           arrhythmia, or cardiac symptoms, 4) no history of comorbid diseases which affect&#xD;
           thyroxine metabolism and cardiac structure, including hepatic or renal disease, anemia,&#xD;
           and hypertension. All subjects who met the enrollment criteria took an electrocardiogram&#xD;
           to rule out arrhythmias. Control subjects were recruited and tested from January 2010 to&#xD;
           July 2011. All participants provided written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assays&#xD;
&#xD;
           On the examination day, all participants were prohibited from smoking and consuming&#xD;
           caffeine. After a light breakfast and medication, including levo-thyroxine (LT4) in&#xD;
           cancer patients, participants visited the hospital before 9 AM. The investigators&#xD;
           evaluated the comorbid conditions of the participants. Body weight and height were&#xD;
           measured while the participants wore light clothing without shoes. The body mass index&#xD;
           (BMI) was calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the height in meters squared.&#xD;
           Their blood pressure was taken after a 10 minute rest period. Subsequently, each subject&#xD;
           underwent a 2-dimensional echocardiogram carried out by one examiner. After the cardiac&#xD;
           work-up, blood samples were drawn to test of thyroid function. Blood samples were&#xD;
           collected in pre-chilled tubes containing EDTA, immediately placed on ice, and promptly&#xD;
           centrifuged at 4°C. After separation, plasma was stored at -80°C for the N-terminal&#xD;
           pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Serum thyroid function tests were performed by a chemiluminescent immunoassay (UNICELL&#xD;
           DXI800, Beckman Coulter, USA). Serum TSH (reference value: 0.3-4.6 mU/L, detection&#xD;
           limit: 0.0025 mU/L), free T4 (reference value: 7.0-20.0 pmol/L), and free T3 (reference&#xD;
           value: 4.0-5.9 pmol/L) were measured. Plasma NT-pro-BNP measurements were done using&#xD;
           chemiluminescent immunoassay method (Roche E170, Roche diagnostics, Germany)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Echocardiography&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comprehensive transthoracic echocardiography was performed using commercially available&#xD;
      equipment (IE33, Philips Medical System, Andover, Massachusetts). Standard 2-dimensional&#xD;
      measurements were obtained as recommended by the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE)&#xD;
      in the left lateral position. Left atrial volume index was measured by the biplane&#xD;
      area-length method. Left ventricular (LV) mass was calculated using the following equation:&#xD;
      LV mass = 0.8 (1.04 { [LVIDd + PWTd + IVSd]3 - [LVIDd]3 } )+ 0.6, where LVID is LV&#xD;
      end-diastolic dimension, PWT is posterior wall thickness, IVS is interventricular septal wall&#xD;
      thickness, and d is diastole. Tissue Doppler-derived early diastolic mitral annular velocity&#xD;
      (e') and late diastolic mitral annular velocity (a') were measured from the septal corner of&#xD;
      the mitral annulus in the apical 4-chamber view. To evaluate the global longitudinal strain&#xD;
      (GLS) of the left ventricle, echocardiographic images were obtained at the apical 4-chambers&#xD;
      view and the strain was analyzed based on routine DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications&#xD;
      in Medicine) data sets using software (2D Cardiac Performance Analysis, TomTec, Munich,&#xD;
      Germany). A region of interest was manually placed on the endocardial and epicardial borders.&#xD;
      The echocardiographic data were gathered and analyzed by 2 experienced echocardiographers who&#xD;
      were unaware of any corresponding clinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Data were reported as means and standard deviation (SD). For the&#xD;
      comparison of means between groups, we used the Mann-Whitney test because the sample size was&#xD;
      small (n=14 for each group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All P values calculated are two-tailed and considered significant at P &lt; 0.05. All&#xD;
      statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 20.0 software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, USA).&#xD;
