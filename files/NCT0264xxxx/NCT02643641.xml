    <textblock>
      BM32 is a product for immunotherapy of grass pollen allergies. It consists of 4 different&#xD;
      recombinant proteins (BM321, BM322, BM325 and BM326) adsorbed on alhydrogel. This&#xD;
      prospective, double-blind. placebo controlled, mono-centric trial investigates the levels of&#xD;
      allergen specific IgG antibodies following 3, 4 or 5 subcutaneous injections before the grass&#xD;
      pollen season.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to further optimize the immunization schedule by&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  moving the last injection into beginning of the grass pollen season for all study arms&#xD;
           in order to ensure highest possible IgG4 levels when they are needed - i.e. at the peak&#xD;
           of the grass pollen season,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  administration of more than 3 pre-seasonal injections in order to build up sufficiently&#xD;
           high levels of IgG4 already in the first year of treatment , and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  dosing during the beginning of the grass pollen season to establish safety in this&#xD;
           setting The effect of such optimized immunization schedule on the induction of an IgG4&#xD;
           immune response as a surrogate parameter for efficacy will be studied. The Total Nasal&#xD;
           Symptom Score (TNSS) before and after the treatment and Combined Symptom-Medication&#xD;
           Score (SMS) during the grass pollen season will be evaluated as secondary endpoints.&#xD;
           This will allow intra-individual comparison of seasonal symptom data and responsiveness&#xD;
           in the chamber setting.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subjects are grass pollen allergic but otherwise healthy. Healthy subjects are&#xD;
             defined as individuals who are free from clinically significant illness or disease as&#xD;
             determined by their medical history (including family), physical examination,&#xD;
             laboratory studies, and other tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They are aged 18 to 60 years inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They have a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) to grass pollen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They have a normal electrocardiogram without clinically significant abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They exhibit a moderate to severe response to approximately 1500 grass pollen&#xD;
             grains/m3 after the first 2h in the Vienna Challenge Chamber, which is defined as a&#xD;
             nasal symptom score (TNSS) of at least 6. (Nasal symptom score is the sum of nasal&#xD;
             obstruction, rhinorrhoea, itchy nose and sneezing, each of which have been scored on a&#xD;
             scale from 0 to 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They have a positive skin prick test with a wheal diameter &gt;5mm for grass pollen&#xD;
             extract at the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They have a positive serum IgE test for timothy grass pollen and to rPhl p 1+rPhl p 5&#xD;
             at the screening visit (ImmunoCAP ≥3.5 kUA/l; i.e ≥ class 2)..&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There are no conditions or factors which would make the subject unlikely to be able to&#xD;
             stay in the chamber for 6 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They are capable of giving informed consent which includes compliance with the&#xD;
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They are available to complete all study measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sensitization to Phl p 7&#xD;

             pregnancy dipstick test).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  On examination the subject is found to have any structural nasal abnormalities or&#xD;
             nasal polyposis, a history of frequent nosebleeds, recent nasal surgery or ongoing&#xD;
             upper respiratory tract infection which in the Responsible Physician's opinion renders&#xD;
             the subject unsuitable for participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any respiratory disease other than mild stable asthma that is controlled with&#xD;
             occasional use of as-needed short-acting beta-agonists and associated with normal lung&#xD;
             function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is concurrently participating or has participated in any clinical study in&#xD;
             the previous month.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in a SIT trial for grass pollen allergy in the three years prior to this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Past or present disease, which as judged by the investigator, may affect the outcome&#xD;
             of this study. These diseases include, but are not limited to, cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
             malignancy, hepatic disease, renal disease, haematological disease, neurological&#xD;
             disease, endocrine disease or pulmonary disease (including but not confined to chronic&#xD;
