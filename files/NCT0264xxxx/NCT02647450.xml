  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 90,000 patients are suffering from long term gastrointestinal problems after&#xD;
      cancer treatments, and whilst the National Cancer Survivorship Initiative have been working&#xD;
      to develop specific pathways of care, these pathways lack in both specialised tariff funding&#xD;
      and awareness. This study aims to assess the economic and personal impact on patients&#xD;
      suffering from stomach and/or bowel problems after cancer treatment prior to referral to the&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal and Nutrition Team (GIANT) at the Royal Marsden Hospital. All patients&#xD;
      referred to the GIANT service (including private patients but excluding re referrals) will be&#xD;
      offered participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of a 9 page patient retrospective questionnaire, asking questions&#xD;
      about investigations and medications prescribed over the past year, as well as costs and&#xD;
      methods of trying to treat their symptoms themselves, and the personal cost to themselves of&#xD;
      their symptoms through loss of work and emotional impact. As this questionnaire asks patients&#xD;
      questions about the past year, and thus can be difficult to answer accurately, patient&#xD;
      answers will be validated for reliability by sending a 1 page questionnaire to their GP&#xD;
      asking the same questions about clinic visits concerning stomach/bowel problems,&#xD;
      investigations and medications prescribed in the past year. Once this data is collected from&#xD;
      the participants, and the study has finished, the average cost of clinical interventions,&#xD;
      economic impact, and personal impact, will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results from this study will be useful in helping to show the economic burden of GI&#xD;
      symptoms, and will provide evidence as to the economic benefit of specialised clinics for the&#xD;
      consequences of cancer treatment; highlighting the need for a nationally recognised algorithm&#xD;
      for management.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of people who survive cancer has tripled in the past 30 years; however, chronic&#xD;
      physical consequences of treatment for cancer adversely affect the quality of life of 20-25%&#xD;
      of survivors. The largest group of patients reporting debilitating chronic side effects are&#xD;
      those treated with radiotherapy alone or in combination with other treatments for pelvic&#xD;
      cancer. Gastrointestinal symptoms are the most common chronic physical side effects reported,&#xD;
      and have the greatest effect on daily activity. Overall, 50% of patients report that that&#xD;
      their gastrointestinal symptoms affect their quality of life, and 20-40% state that this&#xD;
      effect is moderate or severe. Such problems include chronic faecal incontinence (up to 60% of&#xD;
      patients) after radiotherapy for prostate or rectal cancer (53, 54), and chronic loose stool&#xD;
      (47%), defaecatory urgency (29%), or chronic abdominal pain (17%) after radiotherapy for&#xD;
      gynecological cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2010, the UK National Cancer Survivorship Initiative Vision challenged professionals to&#xD;
      develop new models of care for patients because &quot;the needs of cancer survivors are not being&#xD;
      met, that being 'cured' of cancer does not necessarily equate with being well and that&#xD;
      chronic consequences of treatment can have a devastating impact on daily life&quot;. The National&#xD;
      Cancer Survivorship Initiative accepts that currently there is limited access to specialist&#xD;
      services, despite an estimated 90,000 people in the UK experiencing long-term&#xD;
      gastrointestinal problems as a consequence of cancer treatment. Furthermore, recent surveys&#xD;
      of clinical oncologists and gastroenterologists concur with this sentiment, highlighting a&#xD;
      lack of available expertise; with two UK audits of gastroenterology consultants and&#xD;
      oncologists demonstrating no improvement in provision of specialist services between 2003 to&#xD;
      2010. Whilst NHS Improvement has developed stratified pathways of care, the Roadmap for&#xD;
      Recovery report created recently by the Anthony Nolan Bone Marrow Transplant charity&#xD;
      underlined the ongoing issue of lack of specialised commissioning of services for complex&#xD;
      consequences of cancer treatment. It is estimated that £40 million (DoH) is wasted annually&#xD;
      in futile and dangerous treatments for Pelvic Radiation Disease alone; academic estimates&#xD;
      suggest this is closer to £80 million . Furthermore the incapacitating affects of GI symptoms&#xD;
      leads to both loss of productivity and huge social costs. Currently there is no NHS tariff&#xD;
      payable for GI consequences of cancer treatment; however the mean cost per completed episode&#xD;
      of care by the GIANT (Gastrointestinal and Nutrition Team) service was calculated, amounting&#xD;
      to an average cost of £1563 per patient. This can be compared to a tariff of £14,800 per&#xD;
      woman treated with chemo-radiation for cervical cancer, and a cost in excess of £45,000 for a&#xD;
      person with rectal cancer treated with long course chemo-radiation followed by surgery and&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy. With specialist clinics lacking, it can be assumed that the majority&#xD;
      of people living with GI consequences of cancer treatment are being treated by their GPs;&#xD;
      however, the Quality and Outcomes Framework by which GP Surgeries are measured and awarded&#xD;
      financial incentives includes no domain or measure for gastrointestinal problems; and there&#xD;
      have been no studies into the cost of managing patients with GI problems as a consequence of&#xD;
      cancer treatment outside of the GIANT service. This exploratory study is a step in this&#xD;
      direction.&#xD;
