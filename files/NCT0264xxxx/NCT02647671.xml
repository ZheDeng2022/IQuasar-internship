  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the proposed study, investigators will conduct a 90-day dietary intervention study in&#xD;
      human subjects. Thirty individuals at risk for adenomatous colon polyp formation will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive a calcium and multi-mineral-rich natural product (Aquamin) or a&#xD;
      comparable level of calcium alone. There will also be a placebo group. Prior to ingesting the&#xD;
      study agents and following the course of treatment, colonic biopsies will be obtained by&#xD;
      sigmoidoscopy and quantitatively examined for markers of growth and differentiation. In this&#xD;
      study, metabolomic and microbial profiles will also be generated from fecal and colon mucosal&#xD;
      samples taken at baseline and study endpoint.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see what effects a calcium-rich, multi-mineral-rich natural&#xD;
      product, Aquamin®, derived from marine algae, has compared to calcium alone or a sugar pill&#xD;
      (placebo). Investigators are looking at whether these supplements do anything to the cell&#xD;
      lining of the colon. Specifically, to see if Aquamin®, calcium, or placebo (sugar pill)&#xD;
      change markers of cell growth and differentiation (or &quot;biomarkers&quot;) in the cells of the&#xD;
      colon. The natural product, Aquamin®, contains calcium but, in addition, has a significant&#xD;
      amount of magnesium and measurable levels of approximately 70 different trace elements&#xD;
      (essentially, everything the algae can accumulate from seawater). Aquamin is a product that&#xD;
      is marketed for the fortification of food, beverage, and supplement products. In this study,&#xD;
      it is being used for research and therefore, its use is investigational. Calcium supplements&#xD;
      have been shown to reduce colonic polyps (precursor lesions to colon cancer). This study will&#xD;
      NOT look at polyp formation in the colon, but only at biomarkers of colon cell growth and&#xD;
      function. If investigators find that the multi-mineral natural product is substantially more&#xD;
      effective than calcium alone in changing these biomarkers, it is possible that a larger study&#xD;
      could be conducted that is intended to study colon polyp prevention. In order to test these&#xD;
      ideas investigators need to compare the supplement Aquamin®, to something already tested&#xD;
      (calcium) and a placebo (sugar pill) to see if any changes are related to the supplements or&#xD;
      just naturally happen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is increasing recognition that dietary or environmental predispositions to colorectal&#xD;
      cancer may be mediated at least in part by alterations of gut microbial composition and&#xD;
      metabolomic profiles. Human gut microbiota are now recognized to play an important role in&#xD;
      host health and changes in the composition of gut microbial communities have been linked with&#xD;
      metabolic alterations that affect colorectal cancer risk. Investigators have previously&#xD;
      established that dietary supplementation can correlate with metabolic or microbial&#xD;
      alterations in their most recent long-term study in mice on high-fat western diet (HFWD) and&#xD;
      calcium. Investigators had also demonstrated that Aquamin-supplemented mice had significantly&#xD;
      decreased liver and colon tumors. Based on these studies, investigators anticipate that&#xD;
      Aquamin will improve the gut microbial composition and alter the metabolomic profile in these&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant agree to participate in this research study, he/she will be asked to sign this&#xD;
      informed consent document before any tests are performed or data collected. This research&#xD;
      study consists of three time periods (phases): a pre-treatment period; a study treatment&#xD;
      period; and an end-of-study treatment period. The study requires three visits to the&#xD;
      University of Michigan's Clinical Research Unit (MCRU). These are referred to as the&#xD;
      Screening Visit, Baseline Visit and Final Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After participants are determined to meet eligibility requirements, they will be randomized&#xD;
      as to which product they will receive. Randomization is like a flip of a coin. A participant&#xD;
      will have an equal chance (33.3%) of being given one of three assignments: a multi-mineral&#xD;
      natural product (Aquamin®); a calcium-only supplement; or a placebo (&quot;sugar pill&quot;). Each&#xD;
      participant will be required to take four capsules per day (two taken in the morning and two&#xD;
      in the evening) for 90 days. Neither they nor the study team investigators will know which&#xD;
      product they are receiving. That information will be kept in the hands of the pharmacist who&#xD;
      dispenses the agent that participant will take.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each participant will be given a physical examination, which will include measurements&#xD;
           of his/her height, weight, and vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, heart rate,&#xD;
           breathing rate).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study nurse or physician's assistant will review participant's past medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked about any other medical conditions that they may have and all&#xD;
           medication(s) they are currently taking. It is important that participants tell the&#xD;
           study personnel about any medications they are taking including over-the-counter&#xD;
           medications, calcium supplements with or without vitamin D, other vitamins, herbal&#xD;
           medications and alternative medicines. Participants may need to stop some of their&#xD;
           medicines in order to participate in this study. Participants are instructed to inform&#xD;
           study personnel at any time during the study participation if they begin to take any&#xD;
           medication(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study participants will be asked about their intake of foods and supplements containing&#xD;
           calcium and vitamin D.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to provide information regarding their usual food that they&#xD;
           eat (over a year), past year diet history questionnaire (DHQ II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to take a pregnancy test within 14 days before the start of&#xD;
           the study if she is a woman able to become pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to not take calcium, vitamin D, fiber, ginger, or fish oil&#xD;
           supplements (including multivitamins that have low amounts) for 14 days before the study&#xD;
           begins and for 90 days after the study begins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Treatment Period (Baseline Visit through day 90) The second visit will take place&#xD;
      within 60 days of the screening visit at the MCRU. This visit will take about 1.5 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this Baseline Visit, the following will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Each participant will have a flexible sigmoidoscopy with colon biopsies (where twelve&#xD;
      tissue pieces will be removed). At this time a stool sample will also be collected using the&#xD;
      sigmoidoscope. The flexible sigmoidoscopy will be done without bowel preparations such as&#xD;
      those used before a colonoscopy. A gastroenterologist who routinely does this procedure will&#xD;
      do the sigmoidoscopy and remove the tissue / stool samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flexible sigmoidoscopy is a test that allows the investigators to look at the inside of the&#xD;
      colon (large intestine) from the rectum up to 15 centimeters (about 7 inches) into the colon.&#xD;
      For the flexible sigmoidoscopy, subject will lie on its left side on the examining table. The&#xD;
      investigator will insert a short, flexible, lighted tube into the rectum and slowly guide it&#xD;
      into the colon. The tube is called a sigmoidoscope (sig-MOY-duh-skope). The scope transmits&#xD;
      an image of the inside of the rectum and colon so the investigators can carefully examine the&#xD;
      lining of participant's colon. The scope also blows air into the colon, which inflates it and&#xD;
      helps the investigators to see better. During the flexible sigmoidoscopy, the investigator&#xD;
      will remove several small pieces of the lining of the colon (these are called colon biopsies)&#xD;
      using forceps instrument inserted into the scope. Each of the two sigmoidoscopy procedures&#xD;
      (one at the beginning of the study and the other after the participant have completed taking&#xD;
      the agent) requires twelve biopsies (5 mg each; about the size of a grain of wheat).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each participant will have 10 ml (or 2 teaspoons) of blood drawn from a vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each participant will be requested to give a fresh urine sample which will be collected&#xD;
           at the beginning of this visit, before sigmoidoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of this visit (Baseline Visit), all participants will receive the assigned&#xD;
           study agent and instructions for taking the study agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between the beginning of the study treatment period and the end of the study (days 1 through&#xD;
      90):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take capsules containing the assigned study agent (the multi-mineral&#xD;
      natural product or calcium or placebo) for 90 days. This will entail taking a total of four&#xD;
      capsules per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The capsules should be taken as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two in the morning and two in the evening. It is suggested that they be taken at meals, but&#xD;
      this is not required. Subjects can ingest the capsules with as much liquid that they choose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants must avoid starting any new medications or supplements, such as over the counter&#xD;
      calcium supplements (with or without vitamin D), as well as systemic (by mouth)&#xD;
      corticosteroids such as Prednisone and Cortisol. Also, participants should not begin a course&#xD;
      of antibiotic with any cephalosporin antibiotic including rocephin, keflex or omnicef. If&#xD;
      participants are prescribed a cephalosporin antibiotic during the course of study, discuss&#xD;
      this with their physician and the study team. Also, once a month each participant will&#xD;
      receive a phone call or email from the researchers to determine whether they are experiencing&#xD;
      any problems related to the study or any side-effects and to ask how many capsules each&#xD;
      participant has taken. If a participant is a woman who is able to get pregnant, she must use&#xD;
      a reliable method of birth control throughout the study. If a participant thinks she might be&#xD;
      pregnant, she should contact the study team immediately. The study team will arrange for a&#xD;
      pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Study Treatment Period (Final Visit) (Day 90)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within a week after Day-90, each participant will have his/her last visit at the MCRU. This&#xD;
      Final Visit will take about 1 hour. During the End of Study Treatment Final Visit, the&#xD;
      following will happen:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a second flexible sigmoidoscopy (where twelve colon biopsies will&#xD;
           be taken as well as stool samples).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will answer a questionnaire about whether they believed they received the&#xD;
           Aquamin®, calcium or the placebo capsules, any untoward effects of the agents and the&#xD;
           overall study experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will return any unused capsules and answer questions about any study drug&#xD;
           they did not take.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each participant will have 10 ml (or 2 teaspoons) of blood drawn from a vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each participant will be requested to give a fresh urine sample which will be collected&#xD;
           at the beginning of this visit, before sigmoidoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will tell the researchers if they had any negative reactions, side-effects,&#xD;
           or problems over the last month of the study.&#xD;
