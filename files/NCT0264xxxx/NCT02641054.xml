  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CVXL-0107 a glutamate release inhibitor, has shown evidence of antiparkinsonian and&#xD;
      antidyskinetic activity in a macaque model and has shown a significant effect on the&#xD;
      UPDRS-III (Movement Disorder Society - Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale) while &quot;ON&quot;,&#xD;
      as well as an increase of &quot;ON-time&quot; without dyskinesia or without troublesome dyskinesia in a&#xD;
      previous phase 2a proof of concept study. This study will confirm the efficacy of CVXL-0107&#xD;
      in combination with optimal dose of levodopa on motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) .&#xD;

      Phase IIa study, 1:1 randomized, double blind placebo- controlled, with cross-over. Each&#xD;
      volunteer patient will be randomly assigned to receive CVXL-0107 or placebo as add-on PD&#xD;
      therapy and crossed-over to the other arm in the second sequence of the study. They will be&#xD;
      assessed during an acute levodopa challenge test with one intake of the study drug or placebo&#xD;
      with a supra-optimal dose of levodopa after 2 weeks of daily treatment with the same study&#xD;
      drug or placebo. Patients will be cross-overed to the other treatment and reassessed during a&#xD;
      second acute levodopa challenge test after 2 weeks of daily treatment with the study drug or&#xD;
      the placebo. The study will evaluate the anti-PD and the anti-dyskinesia efficacy of&#xD;
      CVXL-0107 as measured by MDS-UPDRS part III (Movement Disorder Society - Unified Parkinson's&#xD;
      Disease Rating Scale) and on levodopa-induced dyskinesia as measured by the AIMS (Abnormal&#xD;
      Involuntary Movement Scale).&#xD;
