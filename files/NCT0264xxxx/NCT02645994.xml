    <textblock>
      Advancement in techniques for anaesthetic drug delivery and real time monitoring has&#xD;
      facilitated safe induction and maintenance of anaesthesia in severely compromised patients.&#xD;
      Cardiac diseases are the commonest causes of morbidity and left ventricular failure is the&#xD;
      commonest clinical presentation at the end stage. LV systolic dysfunction is defined as&#xD;
      reduction in LVEF ≤55%. Patients with LVEF 55%-46% have mild, 45%-36% moderate and ≤35%&#xD;
      severe LV systolic dysfunction. Patients with heart failure have a diminished cardiac reserve&#xD;
      capacity that may be further compromised by anaesthesia. In addition to depression of&#xD;
      sympathetic activity, most anaesthetics interfere with cardiovascular performance, either by&#xD;
      a direct myocardial depression or by modifying cardiovascular control mechanisms. Propofol&#xD;
      with fentanyl is advocated as the best anaesthetic combination for induction of anaesthesia&#xD;
      in patients undergoing CABG. Propofol is a drug with narrow therapeutic index and may cause&#xD;
      severe hypotension and hemodynamic instability during induction of anaesthesia, especially if&#xD;
      it is given in too large doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Automated drug delivery systems are popular for delivery of propofol. They can be of two&#xD;
      types, depending on whether they are based on pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic principles.&#xD;
      Closed Loop Anaesthesia Delivery system has been used world-wide and in our institute in&#xD;
      patients of various age groups and in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. But still the&#xD;
      studies are lacking in patients with moderate to severe left ventricular systolic&#xD;
      dysfunction. Moreover none of the studies have compared the efficacy of anaesthetic drug&#xD;
      delivery using these two devices in this group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus there is paucity of literature regarding PK and PD of propofol in patients with cardiac&#xD;
      failure. The investigators hypothesized that as the Closed Loop Anaesthesia Delivery System&#xD;
      is based on pharmacodyanamic principles, it should perform better than the Target Control&#xD;
      Infusion system, which works on pharmacokinetic principles. The investigators planned to&#xD;
      conduct this study to determine the anaesthetic depth control using Closed Loop Anaesthesia&#xD;
      Delivery system vs. manual control using Target Controlled Infusion in patients with moderate&#xD;
      to severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction.&#xD;

      MATERIALS AND METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be pre-medicated with oral tablet alprazolam 0.25 mg the night before and on the&#xD;
      morning of surgery. In the anesthetic room, 16 G i.v. cannula will be inserted and following&#xD;
      monitors will be attached: continuous pulse-oximetry (SpO2), electrocardiogram (ECG),&#xD;
      periodic non-invasive blood pressure (S/Anesthesia monitor, Datex Ohmeda Inc., Madison, WI) ,&#xD;
      and continuous BIS (BIS XP, Aspect Medical Systems, Newton, MA in the S/5 Anesthesia&#xD;
      monitor). Pre-induction arterial line and central line will be inserted in all patients and&#xD;
      continuous arterial blood pressure and central venous pressure measurements will be recorded.&#xD;
      Pulmonary artery catheter will also be inserted in all patients for monitoring of cardiac&#xD;
      output. All invasive lines will be inserted under local anesthesia. NIBP measurements will be&#xD;
      stopped after transducing arterial line, because it may interfere with the assessment of&#xD;
      MOAA/S score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients will receive i.v. fentanyl at a dose of 3µg.kg-1 over a period 3 minutes,&#xD;
      followed by propofol administration either by CLADS or TCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Propofol will be administered with the Diprifusor (Marsh Pharmacokinetic model, Master TCI&#xD;
      pump, Fresenius Kabi; Bad Homburg; Germany) starting at a predetermined target plasma&#xD;
      propofol concentration (Cp) of 1.8µg.ml-1 based on a previous study. Further target&#xD;
      concentrations were set according to the Dixon up and down method. A failure will be followed&#xD;
      by an increase in the target plasma concentration in the next patient by 0.2µg.ml-1 and a&#xD;
      success will be followed by a decrease in the target plasma concentration in the next patient&#xD;
      by 0.2µg.ml-1. TCI pump will be controlled manually and all the data including BIS and vitals&#xD;
      will be recorded through CLADS into a laptop. MOAA/S will be assessed every 15 second for&#xD;
      assessing time to loss of consciousness; BIS and HR will be recorded every 5 seconds and MAP&#xD;
      and PAP every 10 seconds. Thus, the anesthetic depth control will be assessed based on time&#xD;
      to achieve loss of consciousness and by comparing the dose of propofol required for induction&#xD;
      and maintenance. BIS overshoots and hemodynamic stability will be noted. In case the patient&#xD;
      achieves loss of consciousness within 5 minutes, a 2 minutes observation period will be&#xD;
      allowed for achieving target BIS. If the patient does not achieve target BIS after this&#xD;
      period, the case will be considered a failure. On the other hand, if the patient achieves&#xD;
      target BIS within this period it will be considered a success. In cases where neither LOC nor&#xD;
      target BIS will be achieved within 5 minutes will also be considered a failure Vecuronium&#xD;
      will be administered at a dose of 0.1 mg.kg-1 after the LOC and the patient will be intubated&#xD;
      after 4 minutes. Patients will be ventilated through face mask to maintain normocapnia&#xD;
      administering air-oxygen mixture with FiO2 of 0.6 during the period of induction till&#xD;
      intubation. Fentanyl infusion 1µg.kg.h-1 will provide analgesia with additional boluses of&#xD;
      1µg.kg-1 before skin incision, sternotomy and at the commencement of CPB. Additional bolus of&#xD;
      analgesic supplements (fentanyl 1µg.kg-1) will be given when the mean arterial pressure (MAP)&#xD;
      or heart rate exceeds 25% of the baseline &lt;50. If hypertension or tachycardia persists with a&#xD;
      BIS≤50, either nitroglycerine infusion or esmolol will be used. In conditions of hypotension,&#xD;
      inotropic support and/or vasopressor will be initiated after ensuring normovolaemia. Atropine&#xD;
      sulphate will be used to treat bradycardia (heart rate &lt;45b.p.m.) after excluding other&#xD;
      treatable causes. The MAP on CPB will be maintained between 50 and 80 mmHg using&#xD;
      phenylephrine / nitroglycerine as required. Systemic hypothermia up to 28ºC will be practiced&#xD;
      during CPB and patients will be actively re-warmed to 36ºC before separation from CPB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of patients exhibiting episodes of hypotension or hypertension and the number of&#xD;
      episodes of hypotension or hypertension requiring a change in the propofol target&#xD;
      concentration or the administration of any vasoactive drugs will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on response of the previous patient to propofol administration using Diprifusor at a&#xD;
      predetermined target plasma propofol concentration (Cp), further increments or decrements of&#xD;
      Cp in the subsequent patients will be based on Dixon's up and down method. The target Cp will&#xD;
      be increased by 0.2 µg.ml-1 in patients who do not achieve BIS of 50 and Cp will be is&#xD;
      decreased in subsequent cases by 0.2µg.ml-1 in patients who do. Thus, six to eight pairs of&#xD;
      failure to success transition will be needed for calculation of the EC50 (i.e. the target&#xD;
      concentration at which 50% of the patients achieve BIS of 50). The mean of the mid value of&#xD;
      these transitions will be used to derive the EC50.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study the BIS data will be analyzed for offline determination of induction&#xD;
      time. It is defined as the time at which the BIS reaches ≤50 for 2 consecutive readings from&#xD;
      the start of propofol infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the CLADS group induction and maintenance will be carried out automatically according to&#xD;
      the BIS. Hemodynamics will be controlled automatically through CLADS as well as through&#xD;
      manual ionotropic support as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLADS is a pharmacodynamic-pharmacokinetic model-based adaptive infusion system, which uses&#xD;
      BIS as the controlled variable and standard infusion pump as the 'actuator'. The 'control&#xD;
      algorithm' is based on the relation between various rates of propofol infusion (producing&#xD;
      different plasma concentrations) and BIS, taking into consideration the pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      variables (distribution, clearance). This was established in the developmental stage of&#xD;
      CLADS. The algorithm alters the rate of propofol infusion to steer and maintain BIS to the&#xD;
      set target taking into account existing BIS, time-elapsed since the initiation of infusion,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, time-delay factor between sensing and averaging of BIS data, time-delay&#xD;
      factor between change in infusion rate and actual change in the plasma concentration of&#xD;
      propofol, as well as the peak effect of propofol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An IBM-compatible PC with PENTIUM 4 or higher processor is used to implement the control&#xD;
      algorithm, provide a user interface, and control communication through serial ports (RS 232)&#xD;
      with infusion system (Pilot-C; Fresenius, Paris, France) and vital sign monitor (AS5; Datex&#xD;
      Ohmeda Division, GE Healthcare, Singapore). The drug delivery can operate in two modes&#xD;
      -manual and automatic. In manual mode, rate of propofol infusion is controlled manually&#xD;
      through the keyboard. In 'automatic' mode, the system automatically controls propofol /&#xD;
      isoﬂurane administration as per the control algorithm. The automatic mode further has three&#xD;
      options: (i) induction, (ii) maintenance, and (iii) induction combined with maintenance. The&#xD;
      user must enter a target BIS value, age, weight, height along with the status of patient-low&#xD;
      risk (ASA I-III), high risk (ASA III-IV, NYHA class III), very high risk (ASA IV-V, NYHA&#xD;
      III-IV), or pediatric. The system can also function in 'monitor' mode, where it only updates&#xD;
      BIS and other patient data and provides a graphic display of current and trend values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The system updates the electroencephalographic data every 5 s and calculates the BIS error&#xD;
      (target BIS-actual BIS). It uses PID (proportional integral differential) algorithm based on&#xD;
      this error to make the changes in propofol infusion rate to achieve target BIS. The algorithm&#xD;
      ﬁne tunes the rate and duration of propofol delivery differently during induction and&#xD;
      maintenance phases of anesthesia delivery. During induction, controller tries to achieve the&#xD;
      target concentration in a stepwise fashion (while continuously receiving feedback of BIS&#xD;
      every 5 s) on the basis of the relationship between plasma concentrations and BIS. During&#xD;
      maintenance, 30 s is deemed as one epoch. The initial three as well as the last three BIS&#xD;
      values of each epoch are averaged and compared to assess the trend. When the trends indicate&#xD;
      an increasing BIS, higher target concentrations and so higher propofol rates are set and vice&#xD;
      versa if the trends indicate a decreasing BIS. These trends are also cross-checked with&#xD;
      larger epoch trends before making drug alterations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A safety feature has been added wherein propofol and other anesthetics are stopped&#xD;
      automatically whenever hemodynamics drops below the safety limits set by the operator. This&#xD;
      would restart automatically when hemodynamics improves to values above the predeﬁned lower&#xD;
      limit. The time delay for this automatic cut-off is at the most 10 s, which is the interval&#xD;
      at which the vitals are updated in the controller.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time to achieve loss of consciousness, dose of propofol required for induction and&#xD;
      maintenance, BIS overshoots and hemodynamics will be recorded in patients administered&#xD;
      propofol using CLADS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the surgery, CLADS/TCI will be discontinued and patient will be shifted to the&#xD;
      post-surgical intensive care unit for elective mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS- Physiologic data are presented as mean (SD) and time intervals are&#xD;
      presented as median (range). The performance of the system was assessed by calculating median&#xD;
      performance error (MDPE), median absolute performance error (MDAPE), wobble and divergence&#xD;
      (time related trends) using methods of Varvel et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The performance error is given by the formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PE = [(BISmeasured-BIStarget)÷BIStarget]×100 The median performance error (MDPE) which&#xD;
      reflects the bias of CLADS in the ith subject is determined as MDPE=median {PEij&#xD;
      j=1........Ni } where Ni is the number of (PE) values obtained in the ith sub Median&#xD;
      Performance Error (MDPE) Median Absolute Performance Error (MDAPE)= median {I PEij&#xD;
      j=1........Ni I} Wobble is determined from the equation Wobble=median {I PEij - MDPEiI ,&#xD;
      j=1......Ni }&#xD;
&#xD;
      Global Score (GS) - The Global Score is used to score EEG-guided depth of anesthesia control&#xD;
      systems with one scalar:&#xD;
&#xD;
      GS=(MDAPE+WOBBLE)÷fraction of time BIS∈(40,60) Divergence is the slope of the linear&#xD;
      regression equation of absolute performance error against time and is expressed in units of&#xD;
      percentage divergence per minute. A positive value indicates progressive widening of the gap&#xD;
      between targeted and measured values, whereas a negative value indicates that the measured&#xD;
      values are converging on target. MDPE and MDAPE are measures of bias and precision,&#xD;
      respectively, wobble measures the intra- individual variability in the performance errors.&#xD;
      The percent of time when BIS remains within ±10 of target BIS during closed-loop (CLADS&#xD;
      group) or manual control (TCI group) will also be calculated. Adequacy of hemodynamic control&#xD;
      will be adjudged by the percentage of anesthesia time the mean arterial blood pressure and&#xD;
      heart rate (HR) are within ±25% of baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences between the groups will be analyzed using the unpaired t-test for parametric data&#xD;
      and the Mann- Whitney U test for non-parametric data. Count data will be analysed using the&#xD;
      chi-square test. All analyses will be performed using SPSS v21.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc.,&#xD;
      Chicago IL, U.S.A.) and a P value &lt;0.05 will be taken to be significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For calculation of the EC50 (plasma concentration at which 50% patients achieve a BIS) of&#xD;
      propofol required for induction will be calculated using Dixon and Massey method. Six to&#xD;
      eight pairs are necessary to calculate EC50 from Dixon up and down method. Probit analysis of&#xD;
      the data for TCI group will be then performed to determine EC50 and EC95.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a pilot study, the investigators estimated that manual control using TCI maintained BIS&#xD;
      in the range of ±10 of the target 70% of the time. In order to assess the 20% improvement&#xD;
      from this control, the investigators calculated that they would need to recruit 36 patients&#xD;
      to achieve 80% power at 5% Type I error. A total of 40 patients were recruited, taking into&#xD;
      account possible inadvertent patient attrition.&#xD;
