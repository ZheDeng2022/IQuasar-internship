    <textblock>
      Scientists have developed an instrument which works like an &quot;electronic nose&quot;. It is able to&#xD;
      &quot;sniff&quot; smells and separate different smells by their electronic &quot;signature&quot;. Studies using&#xD;
      an electronic nose strongly suggest that smelling samples taken from humans (e.g. urine/&#xD;
      stool/ sweat/ tears) can identify different electronic smell signature from people with&#xD;
      different diseases and in the future might be a new and easier way to diagnose serious&#xD;
      conditions at an earlier stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a very small study, it has been successfully shown that using an electronic nose to sniff&#xD;
      a stool sample does seem to identify people before they have had any radiotherapy - who will&#xD;
      go on to get serious bowel side effects of radiotherapy. If this finding is correct, this is&#xD;
      very important as it would allow the cancer doctors the option to change the way they give&#xD;
      radiotherapy if they knew that a person was at very high risk of serious side effects from&#xD;
      the treatment and to start treatment for the side effects at a much earlier stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators want to confirm in a larger study whether the previous&#xD;
      findings are correct, and to see whether similar results can be obtained by sniffing urine&#xD;
      rather than stool (that would be much easier for everyone) and identify exactly which part of&#xD;
      the complicated &quot;smell&quot; signature is different in the people who will get side effects. This&#xD;
      may lead for the investigators to able to identify why people are making this specific smell&#xD;
      and then do something about changing the smell before treatment starts. The likeliest cause&#xD;
      for the production of a smell which predisposes to side effects is a specific group of germs&#xD;
      living in the bowel. If these germs can be identified, then there are many possible ways of&#xD;
      changing these germ populations in advance of radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enormous improvements have been made in treating cancer in recent years leading to hugely&#xD;
      improved survival, however, treatment not infrequently can lead to side effects. Of all the&#xD;
      possible long term physical side effects of cancer treatment, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms&#xD;
      are the most common and can have a great impact on daily activity. It is becoming&#xD;
      increasingly clear that development of side effects in the bowel is not just related to the&#xD;
      dose and way the radiotherapy is delivered.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There have been enormous improvements in outcomes for patients diagnosed with cancer in&#xD;
      recent years. Patients survive longer and the number of survivors after cancer therapy&#xD;
      increases 3% annually in the UK and 11% in the USA.It is estimated that there will be 4&#xD;
      million cancer survivors in the UK by 2030.Patients after cancer treatments have many unmet&#xD;
      needs which are often caused by the very therapies given to cure or control the cancer. Of&#xD;
      all the possible chronic physical side effects of cancer treatment, gastrointestinal (GI)&#xD;
      symptoms are the most common and not only have the greatest impact on daily activity but also&#xD;
      frequently carry serious financial, psychological and social implications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During treatment for the cancer, GI symptoms are common and their causes are poorly&#xD;
      researched despite their impact on patients' quality of life and the fact that when they&#xD;
      occur they often require dose reduction or cessation of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy with&#xD;
      potential impact on outcome. In addition, the GI side effect may not settle once anti-cancer&#xD;
      treatment is stopped. In patients receiving radiotherapy for a tumor in the pelvis, more&#xD;
      severe acute reactions predispose to worse long term side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 17,000 British patients are treated annually with radiotherapy for pelvic cancer. Up&#xD;
      to 80% of these patients are left with chronic alteration in GI function, 50% state that this&#xD;
      affects their daily activity and 30% that this change in function has a moderate or severe&#xD;
      effect. While progress has been made in defining optimal management of chronic changes in&#xD;
      bowel function after cancer treatment and UK multi-professional guidance to aid clinicians&#xD;
      has been published it would be extremely valuable to be able to predict those in advance who&#xD;
      might go on to develop serious problems as a result of radiotherapy so as to have the&#xD;
      opportunity to provide them with pre-treatment counseling, potentially modify the cancer&#xD;
      treatment and introduce toxicity modifying therapies at the earliest opportunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is widely believed that technical advances in the delivery of radiotherapy will abolish GI&#xD;
      problems however, recent compelling data demonstrate that 30% of patients treated with&#xD;
      &quot;perfect&quot; radiotherapy - meeting every described constraint still develop significant&#xD;
      un-predicted problems. While mechanisms by which gastrointestinal symptoms occur after cancer&#xD;
      treatment are starting to be understood and personal parameters which change the risk profile&#xD;
      for individuals are being identified (body mass index, concomitant chemotherapy, use of a&#xD;
      statin or ACE inhibitor, the presence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, connective tissue&#xD;
      disorders or HIV infection) the reasons why some patients remain symptom free whilst others&#xD;
      experience severe side effects remains under researched.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has become clear that development of GI toxicity is not solely related to the dose and way&#xD;
      the radiotherapy is delivered, and a phenomenon independent of the radiation called the 'the&#xD;
      consequential effect' is a second reason why some people get chronic side effects after&#xD;
      radiotherapy. An important driver of the 'consequential effect' is increasingly believed to&#xD;
      be the microbiota, the vast numbers of bacteria that live in our guts. The gastrointestinal&#xD;
      microbiota are a complex ecosystem of up to 1,000 bacterial species in any one individual.&#xD;
      The species vary greatly between individuals but within each individual, the flora&#xD;
      composition remains stable for the majority of the species over time. The diversity of the&#xD;
      microbiota is high in healthy people and low in people with GI side effects after pelvic&#xD;
      radiotherapy, a process which very closely parallels findings in people with other much more&#xD;
      intensively researched inflammatory conditions of the bowel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal gut flora produce gases from their metabolites (Volatile Organic Compounds or VOCs).&#xD;
      The gold standard for analyzing volatile organic compounds is gas chromatography/mass&#xD;
      spectrometry (GCMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      GCMS analyses gasses to identify all chemical components of that gas. However, this is very&#xD;
      expensive and requires a specialized laboratory to process the samples hence is not a viable&#xD;
      option in day to day clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two alternative techniques can be applied to analyse those VOCs: electronic sensing (e-nose)&#xD;
      or High Field Asymmetric Ion Mobility Spectrometry (FAIMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electronic sensing techniques are applied via an instrument (electronic nose) that attempts&#xD;
      to replicate the biological olfactory system, by investigating samples as a whole, instead of&#xD;
      identifying specific chemicals within a complex sample. The air above the sample (head space)&#xD;
      is drawn into the e-nose and passed across an array of chemical sensors. The size of the&#xD;
      array varies, but most are between 6 and 32 sensors. As each sensor is dissimilar, the&#xD;
      interaction between the sensor and the sample is unique and an olfactory signature for this&#xD;
      complex odor can be created.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fields Asymmetric Waveform Ion Mobility Spectometry (FAIMS) is a new technology capable of&#xD;
      separating gas phase ions at atmospheric pressure and at room temperature. As with the&#xD;
      electronic nose, FAIMS can be used for the real time analysis of complex chemical components,&#xD;
      looking at the total chemical composition of a sample. Differences in the way the ionised&#xD;
      molecules move in high electric fields are used to draw a mobility signature of a complex&#xD;
      sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The e-nose and FAIMS techniques have been used successfully in small studies to diagnose lung&#xD;
      disease, diabetes, bladder cancer, tuberculosis, cyanide poisoning, renal failure and&#xD;
      schizophrenia. Focusing on gastrointestinal disorders, consistent changes in the VOCs&#xD;
      produced by patients with inflammatory bowel disease, bile acid malabsorption,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal cancer, coeliac disease, Clostridium difficile infection can be identified&#xD;
      compared to healthy individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a paper published in 2012 of a retrospective blinded pilot study using the e-nose in 23&#xD;
      patients in whom the investigators analysed stool samples collected immediately before the&#xD;
      start of radiotherapy. Of the 23 patients selected, 11 subsequently had minimal or no side&#xD;
      effects from radiotherapy and 12 had severe toxicity. The e-nose analysed the samples and&#xD;
      astonishingly identified with 100% accuracy two completely distinct groups of patients: those&#xD;
      who would develop severe toxicity during radiotherapy and those who would not. The results of&#xD;
      this study suggest that the substantial differences in the volatile gases produced by stool&#xD;
      samples in the two populations, have a critical impact on toxicity and the reason that&#xD;
      different fermentation products occur is either because the microbiological composition of&#xD;
      stool differs between the two groups, or because bacterial function is somehow different.&#xD;
      Whatever the reason, these findings suggests that the microbiota plays a critical role in the&#xD;
      initiation of radiation induced inflammation are completely consistent with findings from&#xD;
      other studies using very complex methodologies and with studies investigating the role of the&#xD;
      microbiota in other GI conditions .&#xD;
