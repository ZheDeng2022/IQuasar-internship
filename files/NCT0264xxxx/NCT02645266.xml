  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic Macular Edema is a serious ocular consequence of poorly controlled diabetes. Even&#xD;
      though significant research has been done to clarify the pathogenesis of DME, a clear causal&#xD;
      pathway of the complication is of yet undetermined. However, there is some consensus among&#xD;
      researchers that a cascade of inflammatory markers plays an important role in the disease&#xD;
      process. The study hopes to better delineate the role these inflammatory markers play by&#xD;
      investigating whether basal levels predict response or lack thereof to Aflibercept.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a common and serious complication of diabetic retinopathy and&#xD;
      is one of the leading causes of vision loss in the developed world. Traditionally, DME was&#xD;
      treated with focal grid laser which was not very efficacious. More recently, over the last&#xD;
      decade, the development of intravitreal steroids such as Triamcinolone acetonide and anti-&#xD;
      vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies such as Bevacizumab (off label usage),&#xD;
      Ranibizumab and Aflibercept have proven to be promising. In fact, Aflibercept, being the&#xD;
      latest anti-VEGF entering the market, was found superior to traditional treatment in DA&#xD;
      VINCI, VIVID DME and VISTA DME studies and there are more trials ongoing. Also, several&#xD;
      trials have shown steroids to be superior to laser treatments. The steroids continue to have&#xD;
      a role in management of patient refractory to other treatments. This is thought to be due to&#xD;
      the inflammatory nature of diabetic macular edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Much of the recent success in treatment of DME is owed to the recent developments in our&#xD;
      understanding of the inflammatory cascade in a diabetic eye specially the discovery and&#xD;
      therapeutic targeting of VEGF. The pathophysiology of DME is thought to be complex and is yet&#xD;
      to be fully elucidated; however, a review of literature reveals that there is consensus&#xD;
      amongst researchers and clinicians with regards to the importance of disruption of blood&#xD;
      retinal barrier involving numerous inflammatory mediators and cytokines in this process. It&#xD;
      has been shown that the interruption in BRB is not merely a direct consequence of&#xD;
      hyperglycemia but the outcome of inflammatory cascade initiated by chronic hyperglycemia.&#xD;
      Chronic hyperglycemia leads to increased production of pro-inflammatory molecules such as&#xD;
      advanced glycation end products (AGEs) which are molecules that promote formation of abnormal&#xD;
      cross-links in between proteins. These compounds in turn lead to disruptions of the&#xD;
      functioning BRB through the up regulation of several inflammatory pathways. Currently the&#xD;
      best method to battle AGEs is to prevent their formation through tight glycemic control and&#xD;
      the development of therapies has been focused on targeting downstream inflammatory and&#xD;
      angiogenic mediators such as VEGFs. It has been shown that VEGFs( VEGF A, B, C, D, E and&#xD;
      PLGF) play a major role in neovascularization, formation of new highly friable blood vessels,&#xD;
      increased permeability and disruption of BRB with VEGF-A being the most potent promoter of&#xD;
      neovascularization. Other factors involved include pigment epithelial derived factor (PEDF),&#xD;
      Interleukin-6 and 8( IL-6 and 8), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), Interferon gamma&#xD;
      protein 10(IP-10) etc. It is theorized that some factors play a protective role against the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of DME, including PEDF, FLT3L, GM-CSF, IP-10, IFN alpha. It is therefore the&#xD;
      lack of balance of these factors that is thought to play a major role in diabetic eye&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since, not all patients respond to anti-VEGF therapies injections; researchers have been&#xD;
      pursuing other cytokines and inflammatory mediators as the culprit in the non-responsive&#xD;
      group. Up-to-date there have been numerous studies investigating the levels of cytokines in&#xD;
      the eyes of diabetic patients and based on our extensive review of the literature this/these&#xD;
      mystery molecules can be any of the following cytokines: IL-1, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10,&#xD;
      IL-12, MCP-1, MCP-3, IP-10,VEGF, PLGF, PEDF, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, GM-CSF, GRO(CXCL-1), TNF-alpha,&#xD;
      TGF- beta, Eotaxin, FGF-2, FLT3L,IFN alpha, MDC, MIG(CXCL 9), PKC, and MMP-9. These cytokines&#xD;
      may also present a novel path to monitor disease activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until now, there has not been a study attempting to determine whether basal cytokine levels&#xD;
      are an indication to response to treatment or lack thereof. It is therefore, in our opinion,&#xD;
      essential to carry out such a study as a significant relationship between (an) elevated/&#xD;
      suppressed cytokine and letters gained on best corrected visual acuity or a relationship&#xD;
      between an elevated cytokine and not responding to our VEGF treatments could present a path&#xD;
      for deciding whether a patient is suited for the anti-VEGF treatment at hand. In addition, it&#xD;
      could pave the way for development of a new medication that could act complementary to our&#xD;
      current treatments. Above all, we hope to assist eye surgeons and physicians to help their&#xD;
      patients with the treatment that fits them the best.&#xD;
