      There was no any China mainland data showing the contribution of BBG and PBG to HbA1c in T2DM&#xD;
      patients treated with OADs using the CGM method. Therefore this study is aimed to investigate&#xD;
      the contribution of BBG and PBG to HbA1c in Chinese T2DM patients treated with OADs using&#xD;
      CGMS. It's expected to generate evidence to support the concept of individualized therapy&#xD;
      when patients are uncontrolled by OADs.&#xD;

      Background The current evidence shows that hyperglycemia is one of the important cause of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis。In the DCCT study[1], comparing with the conventional therapy group&#xD;
      (HbA1c&lt;9％), the risk of retinopathy, kidney disease and neuropathy was significantly reduced&#xD;
      in the intensive therapy group (HbA1c&lt;7％). The EDIC study[2] shows that there is a&#xD;
      reduction(42% p=0.02) in the incidence of cardiovascular event in the intensive therapy group&#xD;
      and the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular death reduced by 57%.&#xD;
      (p=0.02). Based on those evidence, we could tell that a continued cardiovascular benefit&#xD;
      after early intensive glucose control was evident among T1DM patients. Similarly, the UKPDS&#xD;
      study[3,4] demonstrated that in the newly diagnosed T2DM patients, the incidence of the&#xD;
      microvascular complication was 25% lower and the cardiovascular complication (include fatal&#xD;
      and nonfatal MI) was 16% lower in the intensive glucose control group which is coincident&#xD;
      with the conclusion from EDIC study. The blood glucose of the diabetes patients are consist&#xD;
      of 3 parts：normal basal blood glucose ,basal hyperglycemia and postprandial hyperglycemia&#xD;
      which is a further increase based on the basal hyperglycemia[5]. HbA1c is the standard&#xD;
      indicator for glucose metabolism which is determined by Basal blood glucose (BBG) and post&#xD;
      prandial glucose (PPG) levels. HbA1c is a risk factor for diabetes vascular lesions has&#xD;
      become the consensus and UKPDS study shows that increasing HbA1c and fasting blood glucose&#xD;
      levels maight be associated with the regression of beta cell function , basal hyperglycemia&#xD;
      is a major cause of diabetic cardiovascular complications[6]. Most previous studies focused&#xD;
      on HbA1c and FPG level to determine the control of blood glucose[7,8] .But now the&#xD;
      relationship between PPG increasing and diabetes complications are gradually valued. Evidence&#xD;
      shows PPG and HbA1c is main predictor of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality in&#xD;
      T2DM[9-11] . The contribution of basal and post-prandial blood glucose to overall glycaemia&#xD;
      is one of point to investigate glucose metabolism impaired. Wenhui Li [12]et al found that&#xD;
      the relationship between fasting, post-absorption blood glucose and HbA1c level is more&#xD;
      closely than with PPG. Especially the blood glucose at 8:00 AM is closely related with HbA1c&#xD;
      (r=0.84), The A1c-Derived Average Glucose study (ADAG) [13]also got the similar conclusion.&#xD;
      However, some other study shows the relationship between PPG and HbA1c is much more closer&#xD;
      [14]. The main reason that lead to this argument is the lack of an accepted accurate method&#xD;
      to assess the contribution of basal and post-prandial blood glucose to overall glycaemia, and&#xD;
      the contribution is associated with the choice of therapeutic strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, few studies have been done to investigate the newly diagnosed or treatment-naive&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes, Only Peter R, et al. found that the contribution of fasting hyperglycemia&#xD;
      derived from a standardized meal test to excess hyperglycemia increase as glycaemia control&#xD;
      deteriorates, becoming dominant with an HbA1c in excess of 7.0%. While in the T2DM patients&#xD;
      treated by OAD, different researchers have concluded differences, such as Monnier et al[5,16]&#xD;
      found that in the T2DM patients treated by OAD, if HbA1c ≤7%, the relative contribution of&#xD;
      PPG was around 69.7%, but this proportion decreased gradually accompany with the increasing&#xD;
      HbA1c. When HbA1c≥10.2%, the contribution of PPG was only 30.5%; Kikuchi et al[17] concluded&#xD;
      the similar result with Monnier in the T2DM patients of Japan. Riddle et al[18] found that&#xD;
      when HbA1c≤8%, PPG contributes more to HbA1c, with the deterioration of blood glucose, the&#xD;
      relative contribution of FPG increased to 70%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, blood glucose fluctuation is affected by many factors such as disease duration, sex,&#xD;
      diet, food cooking methods and race[19]. Our previous study found compared with NGT, the&#xD;
      intra-day blood glucose fluctuation was similar in IGR patients, but it had already occurred.&#xD;
      In the newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients, the inter-day and intra-day blood glucose&#xD;
      fluctuation was significantly increased, besides, the effect of different ratio of&#xD;
      carbohydrate in the diet was different[20-24] For Asian yellow, there are less research and&#xD;
      the conclusions are not consistent. Japanese scholars Kikuchi [17]obtained the similar&#xD;
      conclusion with Monnier, but the study done by Taiwanese researchers [25] show that in the&#xD;
      good blood glucose control patients, the relative contribution of PPG was up to 70% , but&#xD;
      with the blood glucose control deterioration, FPG and PPG to its effect is similar, about 50%&#xD;
      each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until now, the research on the contribution of the BBG and PPG to HbA1c is less, and the&#xD;
      results are different, May be different from the research methods and the study population.&#xD;
      At present, all the research use 6.1mmol/L (WHO criteria)or 5.6mmol/L(ADA criteria) as normal&#xD;
      FBG level (WHO criteria) to calculate the fasting or postprandial hyperglycemia, not&#xD;
      according to the blood glucose fluctuation curve of NGT population, so that the BBG and PPG&#xD;
      contribution of HbA1c might be underestimated or overestimated. In addition, Peter and&#xD;
      Monnier used MTT method which would cause difference result from the T2DM patients in the&#xD;
      real world .Peter, Monnier, Riddle and Kikuchi monitored the blood glucose by collecting pre&#xD;
      or postprandial blood sample frequently or SMBG. The contribution of the postprandial glucose&#xD;
      to HbA1c is underestimated. As the continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) is becoming&#xD;
      more and more widely used, it is considered as a better method to evaluate the contribution&#xD;
      of BBG and PPG to HbA1c because of the minimizing bias which is resulted of research&#xD;
      methodology[25]. There was no any China mainland data showing the contribution of BBG and PBG&#xD;
      to HbA1c in T2DM patients treated with OADs using the CGM method. Therefore this study is&#xD;
      aimed to investigate the contribution of BBG and PBG to HbA1c in Chinese T2DM patients&#xD;
      treated with OADs using CGMS. It's expected to generate evidence to support the concept of&#xD;
      individualized therapy when patients are uncontrolled by OADs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives Primary objective is to investigate the relative contribution of BBG and PBG to&#xD;
      overall glycaemia in T2DM with OAD. The secondary is to investigate the absolute contribution&#xD;
      of BBG and PBG to overall glycaemia in T2DM with OAD treatment, investigate the correlation&#xD;
      between overall glycaemia exposure and HbA1c and regression equation of HbA1c to BBG and PBG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size According to MONNIER' research, the contribution of PBG to whole day&#xD;
      hyperglycemia use 6.1mmol/L as base line is： HbA1c&lt;7.3%， 69.7%±4.18%(n=58)；&#xD;
      HbA1c(7.3-8.4%)，51.34±4.18%(n=58)； HbA1c(8.5-9.2%)，44.18±3.58%(n=58)；&#xD;
      HbA1c(9.3-10.2%)，40.60±4.78%(n=58)； HbA1c&gt;10.2%，30.5%±3.58%(n=58)； If there are 5 groups, the&#xD;
      mean CSS is 854.94, SD is 33.55,α=0.05.After enter the SAS 8.01 software, every group has 22&#xD;
      sizes and totally 110 cases with 5 groups. So more than 132 cases will be enrolled ( rate of&#xD;
      dropout and withdraw is 20%, the cases will need 110+110×0.2=132).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One-Way ANOVA&#xD;
&#xD;
      # Treatments = 5 CSS of Means = 854.94 Standard Deviation = 33.55 Alpha = 0.05&#xD;
&#xD;
      N per Power Group&#xD;
&#xD;
      0.800 17 0.850 19 0.900 22 （SAS 8.01 software）&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because this is exploratory research, so we justified the sample:&#xD;
&#xD;
      T2DM subjects: the primary endpoint is the relative contribution of FBG. The contribution&#xD;
      will be calculated by individual subject. A sample size of 60 for each group produces a&#xD;
      two-sided 95% confidence interval for relative contribution of FBG with a precision of&#xD;
      approximately ±6.5% when the estimated standard deviation is 25% (refer to previous study),&#xD;
      so the total subjects of five group is 300.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal glycaemic subjects: a sample size of 100 normal glycaemic subjects produces a&#xD;
      two-sided 95% confidence interval for AUC with a precision of approximately&#xD;
      ±0.08d∙mmol∙L-1when the estimated standard deviation is 0.4d∙mmol∙L-1(refer to previous&#xD;
      study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects per treatment arm: N (normal glycaemic group)=100; N (T2DM with OADs)=300&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cases with one of the following reasons should be removed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Misdiagnos&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No medication or no regular medication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Irregular diet&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No test recording&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Using any drug which might interfere the glucose metabolism and mislead the result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This is a single center, two groups, cross sectional study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One group consists of normal glycaemic subjects, N=100.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One group consists of T2DM subjects treated with OADs, N= 300, which will be divided&#xD;
           into 5 sub-groups by HbA1c level and each sub-group will include 60 subjects&#xD;
           (HbA1c&lt;6.5%, 6.5-7.0%, 7.0-8.0%, 8.0-9.0%, &gt;=9.0%) CGMS will be used to collect blood&#xD;
           glucose data. The normal glycaemic subjects will not receive any treatment during this&#xD;
           study. The T2DM subjects will maintain their previous OADs treatment and no other new&#xD;
           treatment will be added during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relative and absolute contribution will be calculated by two ways:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Refer the methods of Monnier and Riddle to calculate the contribution with WHO normal&#xD;
           FBG cut point of 6.1 mmol/L&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  AUC 24h total high glycaemia=the area above the curve of FBG 6.1 mmol/L&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  AUCPPG=(the area above pre-prandial glucose in a 4-h period after each meal)X3&#xD;
                meals&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  AUC BBG= AUC 24h total high glycaemia - AUCPPG&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Using the data of the group with normal glycaemic subjects as the basis to calculate the&#xD;
           contribution (no need to select a normal FBG cut-off point, therefore avoid the&#xD;
           overestimated or underestimated contribution of FBG due to the conflict of different FBG&#xD;
           cut-off point in western guideline and China guideline with 5.6 mmol/L and 6.1 mmol/L&#xD;
           respectively)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  AUC24h NGT total=the area above the curve of glucose 0 mmol/L&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  AUC 24h T2DM total= the area above the curve of glucose 0 mmol/L&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Total high glycaemia= AUC 24h total high glycaemia = AUC 24hT2DM total -AUC 24h NGT&#xD;
                total&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  AUC PPG==(the area above post-prandial glucose in a 4-h period after each meal)X3&#xD;
                meals in T2DM patients&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  AUC BBG= AUC 24h total high glycaemia- AUCPPG&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relative glucose contribution calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Relative contribution of BBG= AUC BBG/ AUC 24h total high glycaemia X100%&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Relative contribution of PPG= AUC PPG/ AUC 24h total high glycaemiaX100%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absolute glucose contribution calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Refer Monnier, et al: Absolute PBG contribution= HbA1c×(AUCPBG/AUCtotal)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Refer Peter, at al: Absolute PBG contribution= [（mean HbA1c-T2DM - mean&#xD;
                HbA1c-NGT）×AUCPBG/ AUCtotal]; Absolute BBG contribution= [（mean HbA1c-T2DM - mean&#xD;
                HbA1c-NGT）×（AUCtotal-AUCPBG）/ AUCtotal]&#xD;
&#xD;
      The contribution with ADA normal FBG cut point of 5.6mmol/L is the same as above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events record and report&#xD;
&#xD;
