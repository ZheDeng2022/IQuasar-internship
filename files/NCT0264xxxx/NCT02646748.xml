    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1b platform study in subjects with advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic solid tumors (Part 1a) and subjects with selected solid tumors (Part 1b and Part&#xD;
      2). Two treatment groups (Group A and Group B) will be evaluated&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1a utilizes a 3+3 design to evaluate pembrolizumab and INCB combinations in advanced&#xD;
      solid tumors. Group A will evaluate a JAK inhibitor with JAK1 selectivity itacitinib&#xD;
      (INCB039110) in combination with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) and Group B will evaluate a&#xD;
      PI3K-delta inhibitor (INCB050465) in combination with pembrolizumab to determine the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) or PAD and recommend a dose for the Part 1b safety expansion with each&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the recommended dose has been identified in Part 1a, subjects with select solid tumor&#xD;
      types will be enrolled into safety expansion cohorts based upon prior treatment history with&#xD;
      a PD-1 pathway-targeted agent (Part 1b) for each combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 utilizes a Simon 2-Stage design to evaluate INCB050465 in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and a 1 stage design to evaluate&#xD;
      the combination in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and urothelial cancer&#xD;
      (UC).&#xD;

      This is an open-label, Phase 1b, 3 Part (Part 1a, Part 1b, and Part 2), multi-center study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1a utilizes a 3+3 design to evaluate pembrolizumab and INCB combinations in advanced&#xD;
      solid tumors. Group A will evaluate a JAK inhibitor with JAK1 selectivity itacitinib&#xD;
      (INCB039110) in combination with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) and Group B will evaluate a&#xD;
      PI3K-delta inhibitor (INCB050465) in combination with pembrolizumab to determine the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) or PAD and recommend a dose for the Part 1b safety expansion with each&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the recommended dose has been identified in Part 1a, subjects with endometrial cancer,&#xD;
      gastric cancer, melanoma, microsatellite unstable (MSI) colorectal cancer or other&#xD;
      MMR-deficient tumors, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma, triple negative breast cancer, pancreatic ductal carcinoma, or&#xD;
      transitional cell carcinoma of the genitourinary tract will be enrolled into safety expansion&#xD;
      cohorts based upon prior treatment history with a PD-1 pathway-targeted agent (Part 1b) for&#xD;
      each combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 utilizes a Simon 2-Stage design to evaluate INCB050465 in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and a 1 stage design to evaluate&#xD;
      the combination in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and urothelial cancer&#xD;
