  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rapid volume expansion using repeated intravenous fluid boluses is a very common intervention&#xD;
      performed in the intensive care unit (ICU) in the early days of resuscitation of patients&#xD;
      with shock. Once passed the initial phase of resuscitation, the fluid boluses administered&#xD;
      fail to effectively increase the patients' cardiac output in about 50% of cases. Pulse&#xD;
      pressure changes or stroke volume changes induced by a Passive Leg Raising (PLR) test have&#xD;
      acceptable/good ability to predict fluid responsiveness (in terms of cardiac output change)&#xD;
      and may be systematically used in patients with persistent shock with the aim of limiting the&#xD;
      total amount of fluid administered to patients by avoiding undue fluid boluses. One may&#xD;
      suppose that such a volume expansion management policy could impact morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      of shocked patients. Among the predictive indices available in clinical practice, the PLR&#xD;
      test has the advantages of being usable regardless of the patients' respiratory status and&#xD;
      cardiac rhythm. Changes in left ventricular stroke volume during the PLR test perform better&#xD;
      that changes in pulse pressure to predict fluid responsiveness. However, in counterpart,&#xD;
      pulse pressure changes during PLR can be assessed without the need of other hemodynamic&#xD;
      exploration such central venous pressure measurement or cardiac output monitoring. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesized that strategies using either stroke volume changes or pulse&#xD;
      pressure changes induced by the PLR test to decide wether a fluid bolus clinically deemed&#xD;
      indicated should or should not be administered, may limit the amount of fluid received by the&#xD;
      patients during the first 5 days of shock, improve their oxygenation index, and shorten the&#xD;
      time passed under mechanical ventilation, as compared to a &quot;liberal&quot; strategy (usual care)&#xD;
      that does not use predictive indices of fluid responsiveness.&#xD;

      A pilot, single-center, randomized, open-label, 3 parallel groups clinical trial with 1:1:1&#xD;
      assignment of interventions, comparing outcomes between patients with persistent shock&#xD;
      assigned to either 1) the &quot;Volume expansion guided by PLR-induced changes in Stroke Volume&quot;&#xD;
      strategy, or 2) the &quot;Volume expansion guided by PLR-induced changes in Pulse Pressure&quot;&#xD;
      strategy, or 3) to usual care (i.e., without the use of any predictive index of fluid&#xD;
      responsiveness). Patients in shock (either of septic, cardiac or other origin) will be&#xD;
      included once passed the first hours of resuscitation. The time window for inclusion will be&#xD;
      from 6 to 24 hours after the beginning of resuscitation, a delay necessary to ensure that&#xD;
      initial hypovolemia has been fully compensated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization will be stratified according to the presumed origin of shock (cardiac,&#xD;
      septic, or other) and according to the PaO2/FiO2 ratio (&lt;200 or ≥ 200 mmHg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomly assigned intervention will be used during the first 5 days of shock (120 hours).&#xD;

    <description>During the intervention period (i.e., within 120 hrs following inclusion), every time a fluid bolus is deemed necessary to improve the patient's cardiac output, the final decision to administer or not the fluid bolus will be determined by the percentage changes in Stroke Volume (SV) observed during a 1-min Passive Leg Raising test: Administration of the fluid bolus if SV changes ≥10%, or no administration otherwise. Measurement of beat-to-beat stroke volume by intraarterial pulse contour analysis using the PiCCO system (Pulsion, Germany) will be used to assess stroke volume changes.
