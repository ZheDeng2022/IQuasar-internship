      This is a phase II, open-label, non-randomized, prospective study of haploidentical&#xD;
      transplantation using KIR-favorable donors for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia&#xD;
      (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) undergoing allogeneic&#xD;
      hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). The relationship of KIR2DL1 polymorphisms to&#xD;
      survival in children with these diseases undergoing any approach to allogeneic HCT during the&#xD;
      study time frame will also be determined.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) using matched related and unrelated&#xD;
      donors is well-accepted therapy for children with subtypes of high-risk acute lymphoblastic&#xD;
      leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). For the 40-50% of children who do not have&#xD;
      matched donors available, HCT approaches have varied by center and regional preferences. HCT&#xD;
      physicians in France and North America tend to use human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched&#xD;
      umbilical cord blood (UCB), while those in many large centers in Germany, parts of Asia, and&#xD;
      selected US centers favor HLA-haploidentical donors. Both approaches have improved&#xD;
      significantly through the years for a variety of reasons, including better supportive care,&#xD;
      cell processing techniques that now deliver more consistently high-quality products,&#xD;
      understanding of the importance of cell dose, and key modifications of preparative and&#xD;
      immunosuppressive regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both stem cell sources offer distinct advantages and disadvantages. T-cell-depleted&#xD;
      haploidentical approaches with killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) mismatches have&#xD;
      been shown to lead to less relapse in patients with AML13 and, in some studies, children with&#xD;
      ALL as well. Disadvantages to this approach have been vulnerability to viral infection and&#xD;
      the requirement for an ex vivo T-cell depletion procedure that is currently under IND. Cord&#xD;
      blood is readily available and is permissive of some degree of HLA mismatch, but current&#xD;
      studies show no advantage in survival compared with matched unrelated donors. Recently, a&#xD;
      randomized study of one vs. two UCB units based on a hypothesis of decreased relapse&#xD;
      incidence with two units resulted in equivalent outcomes in both arms. Neutrophil engraftment&#xD;
      and immune recovery after UCB transplantation is relatively slow, leading to a higher risk of&#xD;
      transplant-related mortality; in addition, larger patients require two cord units,&#xD;
      dramatically increasing the cost of stem cell procurement. No direct comparisons of these two&#xD;
      stem cell sources (haploidentical vs. UCB) have been performed in pediatric patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, investigators at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital published excellent outcomes&#xD;
      using haploidentical donors with grafts depleted for CD3+ cells by an ex vivo Miltenyi&#xD;
      CliniMACS system. Their recent cohort of AML and ALL patients treated without total body&#xD;
      irradiation (TBI) had a 5-year survival of 88±15% in 19 consecutive patients, with 17&#xD;
      surviving long-term and disease-free and only 2 patients died of progressive leukemia. These&#xD;
      results compared favorably with the 5-year survival of 70±38% for transplantations using&#xD;
      matched siblings and 61±17% for matched unrelated donors treated with identical leukemia&#xD;
      protocols with indications for transplantation defined a priori. These preliminary results&#xD;
      suggest that a strategy of using favorable KIR-mismatched haploidentical transplantation may&#xD;
      lead to a better outcome than other alternative donor approaches without the side effects of&#xD;
      TBI. This protocol is a phase II trial seeking to establish the feasibility and preliminary&#xD;
      outcomes with this approach in a multi-institutional setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to KIR-HLA matching, KIR allele polymorphism may also affect transplant&#xD;
      outcomes.Recent data from St. Jude showed that in 312 pediatric HCTs, the patients who&#xD;
      received a donor graft containing the functionally stronger KIR2DL1 allele with arginine at&#xD;
      amino acid position 245 (KIR2DL1-R245) had better survival (p=0.0028) and a lower relapse&#xD;
      rate (p=0.022) than those who received a donor graft that contained only the functionally&#xD;
      weaker KIR2DL1 allele with cysteine at the same position (KIR2DL1-C245). Patients who&#xD;
      received a KIR2DL1-R245-positive graft with an HLA-C receptor-ligand mismatch had the best&#xD;
      survival (p=0.00004) and lowest risk of leukemia relapse (p=0.005). Thus, both KIR-HLA&#xD;
      matching and KIR allele polymorphism have prognostic value. We will attempt to prospectively&#xD;
      confirm these results in this multicenter trial.&#xD;

             wait for an unrelated donor to become available (refer to subsection 2.5.1 for further&#xD;
             details).&#xD;
