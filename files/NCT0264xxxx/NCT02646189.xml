      REP 9AC (REP 2055) is a nucleic acid polymer (NAP) with entry and post-entry antiviral&#xD;
      activity against duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) infection. REP 2055 has been shown to have&#xD;
      potent therapeutic effect against established DHBV infection in vivo&#xD;
&#xD;
      REP 2055 was additionally shown to have significant antiviral effects in patients with&#xD;
      chronic HBV infection in the previous REP 101 study. REP 2139 is a version of REP 2055&#xD;
      designed for improved administration tolerability and stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and antiviral activity REP 2139, first in monotherapy and then in combination with&#xD;
      immunotherapy in patients with chronic HBV infection will be assessed in the REP 102&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis B is a long term condition caused by infection of the body with the&#xD;
      hepatitis B virus (HBV). This infection often results in inflammation or scarring of the&#xD;
      liver and can eventually lead to liver cirrhosis and liver failure. These infections are also&#xD;
      one of the major causes of the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although some drugs have been approved to treat chronic hepatitis B infections, they do not&#xD;
      provide a complete cure except in rare cases (a cure generally means that a person loses the&#xD;
      hepatitis B virus from the blood and the liver and develops a durable immunological control&#xD;
      of subsequent HBV infection). However, these drugs do significantly decrease the risk of&#xD;
      liver damage and liver cancer arising from the presence of a chronic liver infection by&#xD;
      slowing or stopping the production of infectious virus. Thus the primary problem associated&#xD;
      with currently available drugs is the lack of clearance of the virus from the hepatocytes&#xD;
      which necessitates long term treatment with these drugs. There is clearly a need to identify&#xD;
      new drugs that can benefit patients with chronic hepatitis B infections. Nucleic acid-based&#xD;
      polymers (NAPs) are a new class of broad-spectrum antiviral compounds which act against HBV&#xD;
      infection by blocking the release of the surface antigen protein (HBsAg) from infected&#xD;
      hepatocytes. In the human patients in the REP 101 protocol, the previous NAP clinical&#xD;
      candidate, REP 9AC (REP 2055), rapidly induced pronounced reductions in or clearance of serum&#xD;
      HBsAg in 7 out of 8 patients. HBsAg is the major immunoinhibitory mechanism by which HBV&#xD;
      maintains its chronicity and by reducing or eliminating HBsAg from the blood, REP 9AC appears&#xD;
      able to elicit restoration of durable immunological responses in patients capable of clearing&#xD;
      the HBV infection. The performance of REP 9AC in providing sustained virologic responses&#xD;
      (SVRs) in patients with chronic HBV infection appeared to be far superior than any compound&#xD;
      currently approved for the treatment of HBV infection&#xD;
&#xD;
      REP 9AC' (REP 2139) is a modified version of its predecessor, REP 9AC (REP 2055). Both are&#xD;
      40mer phosphorothioate oligonucleotides comprised of alternating adenosine and cytidine&#xD;
      nucleotides and in the case of REP 9AC, has been shown to have low toxicity and to be highly&#xD;
      effective in treating hepatitis B infection in human patients. The modifications in REP 9AC'&#xD;
      significantly improve the stability and reduce the pro-inflammatory activity of REP 9AC'&#xD;
      compared to that of REP 9AC while retaining all the antiviral activity found in REP 9AC. Both&#xD;
      these modifications (5-methylation of cytosines and 2' O methylation of the ribose sugar in&#xD;
      each nucleotide) are naturally occurring modifications in human nucleic acid and are known to&#xD;
      be well tolerated in clinical trials. It is expected that REP 9AC' will be able to achieve a&#xD;
      more robust antiviral activity in patients with chronic HBV with significantly lower dosing&#xD;
      requirements and fewer side effects than REP 9AC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current interim data analysis from the still ongoing REP 101 assessing the activity of REP&#xD;
      9AC in patients with chronic HBV infection indicates the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. REP 9AC exposure in eight patients has been generally well tolerated at doses up to&#xD;
           600mg / week and 400mg / day (for seven continuous days). Administration related side&#xD;
           effects include mild to moderate pro-inflammatory reactions during the drug&#xD;
           administration (itching and fever) which disappear after drug administration is&#xD;
           complete. Chronic side effects include mild elevations in blood anticoagulation&#xD;
           (international normalized ratio ~1.5) and serum hypocalcemia (which is easily mitigated&#xD;
           with a mineral supplement).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. REP 9AC has achieved serum HBsAg reduction or clearance in all patients compliant with&#xD;
           the proscribed dosing regimen (7 out of 7).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In these seven patients, 5 have demonstrated restoration of at least a partial&#xD;
           immunological control of their infection (appearance of serum anti-HBs and the&#xD;
           establishment of a lower serum HBV DNA setpoint).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Of the five patients achieving having an immunological response, three have achieved a&#xD;
           SVR off treatment with as few as 20 weeks of REP 9AC treatment with complete and durable&#xD;
           immunological control over their infection for 18, 12 and 10.5 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Suboptimal stability of REP 9AC is a likely factor impairing the performance of the&#xD;
           drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed study is designed to demonstrate that REP 9AC' can be well tolerated when given&#xD;
      to human patients chronically infected with HBV and to evaluate if a reduction of viral&#xD;
      titers can be observed when REP 9AC' is administered as a monotherapy and then in combination&#xD;
      with immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NAPs: Replicor's technology utilizes the novel properties of NAPs to inhibit interactions&#xD;
      critical for viral activity. This technology is active in vitro against all known families of&#xD;
      enveloped viruses. REPLICor's proof of concept compounds, REP 9 (REP 2006) and REP 9C (REP&#xD;
      2031) and its first generation clinical candidate, REP 9AC (REP 2055) have also demonstrated&#xD;
      potent antiviral activity in vivo against the following viral infections: HCV, HBV (DHBV),&#xD;
      Cytomegalovirus, Herpes Simplex virus-2, Ebola, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NAPs (REP 9, REP 9C and REP 9AC) have been administered at therapeutically active doses in&#xD;
      acute and chronic regimens by multiple routes of administration (parenteral, oral, topical&#xD;
      and aerosol) in mice, rats, hamsters, guinea pigs, ducks and non human primate species with&#xD;
      no detectable side effects. Moreover, this class of chemical compounds (phosphorothioate&#xD;
      oligonucleotides) are known to be well tolerated in human patients in several clinical&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REPLICor has validated the compatibility of the modifications in REP 9AC' with the antiviral&#xD;
      activity present in NAPs indirectly: the 2'O methyl sugar modification was found to not&#xD;
      affect the antiviral activity of NAPs against duck hepatitis B virus in vivo and further&#xD;
      shown to substantially improve the stability of NAPs to nuclease degradation and&#xD;
      substantially reduce their immunoreactivity in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells . The&#xD;
      5'methylation of cytosine was shown not to affect target interaction in cell free interaction&#xD;
      assays and is well known to mitigate the immunoreactivity of nucleic acids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is now a widely held notion that any successful outcome in the treatment of chronic HBV&#xD;
      must involve immunostimulation in order to catalyze restoration of the appropriate immune&#xD;
      responses (both adaptive and innate) in order to achieve durable control over HBV infection&#xD;
      after therapy. The results from REP 101 protocol suggest that elimination of serum HBsAg&#xD;
      removes the chronic immunosuppression mediated by this protein. However there is a&#xD;
      heterogeneous immunological response to HBsAg reduction / clearance in the patients treated&#xD;
      to date (as measured by serum HBV DNA decline): only about 40% of patients appear to exhibit&#xD;
      a strong immunological response after the reduction / removal of serum HBsAg . This&#xD;
      observation strongly suggests that while HBsAg suppression is essential for establishing&#xD;
      durable immunological control, specific immunostimulation may also be required in many&#xD;
      patients in order for them to achieve durable immunological control .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thymosin alpha 1 (Zadaxin™) is synthetically prepared thymosin alpha 1 polypeptide (28 amino&#xD;
      acids, molecular weight 3108) which is identical to the naturally occurring thymosin alpha 1&#xD;
      present in humans. Thymosin alpha 1 shares homology with the interferon alpha family of&#xD;
      peptides but unlike interferon alpha, Zadaxin administration in human subjects is not&#xD;
      accompanied by any significant side effects. More importantly, Zadaxin administration with&#xD;
      other proinflammatory compounds (like interferon alpha) does not alter the side effect&#xD;
      profiles of those compounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zadaxin shares many of the immunostimulatory properties of interferon alpha in that it is&#xD;
      able to stimulate the production of several cytokines important in reestablishing an immune&#xD;
      response capable of controlling the HBV infection. Zadaxin is also able to stimulate the&#xD;
      production of natural killer, CD4 and CD8 cells all known to be correlated with the&#xD;
      establishment of a durable immunological control of HBV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the treatment of chronic HBV in the clinic, Zadaxin monotherapy is able to achieve HBeAg&#xD;
      and HBV DNA seroclearance in 30-50% of patients which is comparable or better than that&#xD;
      achievable with interferon alpha. More important is the consistent observation that the&#xD;
      proportion of patients achieving HBV DNA seroclearance off therapy continually increases (an&#xD;
      effect not observed with interferon alpha).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the very low side effect profile of Zadaxin (both as a monotherapy and in&#xD;
      combination with interferon alpha and HBV polymerase inhibitors) and its clear ability to&#xD;
      stimulate functional and durable immune response and control of HBV in patients with chronic&#xD;
      HBV infections, the investigators strongly suspect that Zadaxin add-on therapy in patients&#xD;
      currently receiving REP 9AC' will be safe and may have a synergistic effect on the ability of&#xD;
      patients to achieve durable immunological control, thus greatly increasing the proportion of&#xD;
      patients achieving durable immunological control with REP 9AC' - Zadaxin therapy compared to&#xD;
      either therapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It may be possible that the immunostimulation provided by Zadaxin™ may not provide a strong&#xD;
      or broad enough immunostimulatory effect to provide an additive or synergistic antiviral&#xD;
      response from the patient's immune system while on REP 9AC' therapy. Since Pegasys™ is a much&#xD;
      stronger immunostimulatory drug but having significant side effects, dosing with this&#xD;
      compound will be slowly escalated each week to a full dose (180 ug once weekly) providing no&#xD;
      grade 3 adverse events are observed.&#xD;
