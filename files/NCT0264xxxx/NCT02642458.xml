      Despite the clear benefit of a combination therapy of pertuzumab plus trastuzumab plus&#xD;
      docetaxel when compared with a combination therapy of trastuzumab and docetaxel the study&#xD;
      populations of the CLEOPATRA trial might be slightly different from a patient population, in&#xD;
      which pertuzumab, plus trastuzumab plus chemotherapy or trastuzumab plus chemotherapy are&#xD;
      applied in routine clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This non-interventional approach aims to confirm the clinically relevant outcomes shown in&#xD;
      the phase III CLEOPATRA study in patients with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer in&#xD;
      routine practice. Docetaxel is recommended as chemotherapy, however, any treatment choice or&#xD;
      change in regimen is performed at the discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on efficacy, safety, tolerability and quality of life will be documented for this&#xD;
      purpose. Following the recommendations as laid down in guidelines for treatment of breast&#xD;
      cancer, the quality of life of patients will be assessed on a regular basis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the commonest cancer in women worldwide with an estimated 1.4 million new&#xD;
      diagnoses in 2008 and 1.6 million cases estimated for 2015. In 2008 breast cancer was&#xD;
      responsible for approximately 23% of all new cancer diagnoses in women. It is also the&#xD;
      commonest cause of cancer deaths in women worldwide: in 2008 some 458,500 women died from&#xD;
      breast cancer, with a further 538,500 projected for 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In developed countries most breast cancers (in 94%-95% of patients in the EU and USA) are&#xD;
      diagnosed while the tumour is confined to the breast - with or without locoregional lymph&#xD;
      node involvement. At this early breast cancer (EBC) stage the disease is normally operable&#xD;
      and can be treated curatively. Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is less common and occurs in&#xD;
      5%-6% of newly diagnosed cases. Despite advances in the treatment of EBC approximately 30% of&#xD;
      women develop local recurrence or metastases. In the USA and Europe patients with MBC survive&#xD;
      for a mean 24 months and have a 5 year survival rate of 18%-23%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 18% and 20% of breast cancers show HER2 amplification and/or HER2 receptor&#xD;
      overexpression. Such patients have a poor prognosis on conventional treatment. The HER2&#xD;
      receptor is a protein belonging to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family. The&#xD;
      HER family consists of four structurally similar receptors - HER1/EGFR, HER2, HER3, HER4 -&#xD;
      and regulates cell processes such as differentiation, invasion, proliferation,&#xD;
      neoangiogenesis, survival and metastatic potential. In breast cancer HER2 positivity is&#xD;
      associated with more aggressive tumours, higher relapse rates, lower and shorter treatment&#xD;
      response and increased mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic treatment options in MBC include chemotherapy along with hormonal and targeted&#xD;
      approaches. Tumor properties and patient-specific factors determine the choice of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In HER2-positive MBC trastuzumab for many years was the reference first-line treatment.&#xD;
      Treatment-naive HER2-positive patients with MBC treated with trastuzumab and taxane&#xD;
      chemotherapy showed significantly longer median time to progression (TTP), higher objective&#xD;
      response rates (ORR) and longer median response and median survival than patients treated&#xD;
      with chemotherapy alone. Although trastuzumab has proved effective in combination with&#xD;
      chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of patients with HER2-positive MBC, approximately&#xD;
      50% of patients experience disease progression within one year of starting treatment. Mean&#xD;
      survival in HER2-positive patients in the pivotal studies of trastuzumab in combination with&#xD;
      a taxane was 24.8 and 31.2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore there is high medical need for novel HER2-targeted therapies to improve survival&#xD;
      outcomes in patients with HER2-positive MBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An essential step in activating downstream signalling pathways is homo or heterodimerisation&#xD;
      of the HER2 receptor with the other member of the HER family. Inhibition of HER2 dimerisation&#xD;
      inhibits the downstream signalling pathways that mediate cancer cell proliferation and&#xD;
      survival. Pertuzumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody, is the first HER2 dimerisation&#xD;
      inhibitor (HDI). It binds specifically to the extracellular dimerisation domain of the HER2&#xD;
      receptor, thereby inhibiting ligand-dependent heterodimerisation of the receptor with other&#xD;
      HER family members. Pertuzumab actually inhibits ligand-activated intracellular signal&#xD;
      transduction in two main signalling pathways - the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)&#xD;
      pathway and the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Inhibition of these signalling&#xD;
      pathways can arrest cell growth and cause apoptosis. Pertuzumab also mediates&#xD;
      antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Pertuzumab and trastuzumab bind to&#xD;
      different epitopes on the HER2 receptor. Their mechanisms of action complement each other to&#xD;
      ensure more comprehensive blockade of HER2-dependent signalling pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase III, multicentre, randomised, double-blind and placebo-controlled clinical&#xD;
      CLEOPATRA trial compared pertuzumab plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel vs placebo plus&#xD;
      trastuzumab plus docetaxel in 808 patients with HER2-positive metastatic, locally recurrentor&#xD;
      inoperable breast cancer. Patients may have received one hormonal treatment for metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer before randomization. Patients may have received adjuvant or neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy with or without trastuzumab before randomization, with an interval of at least&#xD;
      12 months between completion of the adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy and the diagnosis of&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer. Randomised patients were stratified by previous treatment status&#xD;
      (with or without previous adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy) and geographic location (Europe,&#xD;
      North America, South America and Asia). Pertuzumab was given intravenously at a starting dose&#xD;
      of 840 mg followed by a dose of 420 mg every 3 weeks. Trastuzumab was given intravenously at&#xD;
      a starting dose of 8 mg/kg followed by a dose of 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Patients were treated&#xD;
      with pertuzumab plus trastuzumab until disease progression, withdrawal of consent to&#xD;
      participation or the development of uncontrollable toxicity. Docetaxel was given as an&#xD;
      intravenous infusion at a starting dose of 75 mg/m² every 3 weeks for at least 6 cycles. If&#xD;
      the starting dose was well-tolerated, the dose of docetaxel could be increased up to 100&#xD;
      mg/m² at the investigator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), assessed by an independent&#xD;
      review facility (IRF) and defined as the interval between randomisation and disease&#xD;
      progression or death (from any cause), where death occurred within 18 weeks of the last&#xD;
      disease assessment. The secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS), (investigator-rated)&#xD;
      PFS, objective response rate (ORR), duration of response and time to progression (TTP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic characteristics were evenly balanced (mean age was 54 years, most [59%] were&#xD;
      Caucasian and all but two were female). In each treatment group approximately half the&#xD;
      patients had hormone (estrogen or progesterone) receptor-positive disease and had received&#xD;
      previous adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy (184 patients [45.8%] in the pertuzumab group vs 192&#xD;
      patients [47.3%] in the placebo group). Most (37.3% and 40.4%, respectively) had previously&#xD;
      received anthracyclines and approximately 10% had previously received trastuzumab (11.7% and&#xD;
      10.1%). A total 43% of patients from both groups had received prior radiotherapy. The mean&#xD;
      baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 64.8% in the pertuzumab group and&#xD;
      65.6% in the placebo group (median 65.0%, range 50%-88% in the two groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CLEOPATRA study showed statistically significant improvement of IRF-rated PFS in the&#xD;
      pertuzumab group vs placebo (hazard ratio [HR]=0.62; 95% CI=0.51; 0.75, p&lt;0.0001) and an&#xD;
      increase in median PFS of 6.1 months. Median PFS was 18.5 months in the pertuzumab group vs&#xD;
      12.4 months in the placebo group. Moreover, CLEOPATRA showed statistically significant&#xD;
      improvement of overall survival in the pertuzumab group vs placebo (hazard ratio [HR]=0.68;&#xD;
      95% CI=0.56; 0.84, p&lt;0.0002) and an increase in median OS of 15.7 months. Median OS was 56.5&#xD;
      months in the pertuzumab group vs 40.8 months in the placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the clear benefit of a combination therapy of pertuzumab plus trastuzumab plus&#xD;
      docetaxel when compared with a combination therapy of trastuzumab and docetaxel the study&#xD;
      populations of the CLEOPATRA study might be slightly different from a patient population, in&#xD;
      which pertuzumab, plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel or trastuzumab plus docetaxel are applied&#xD;
      in routine clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This non-interventional approach aims to confirm the clinically relevant outcomes shown in&#xD;
      the phase III CLEOPATRA study in patients with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer in&#xD;
      routine practice. Data on efficacy, safety, tolerability and quality of life will be&#xD;
