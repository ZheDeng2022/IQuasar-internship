      This is a safety (Phase 1) trial using mebendazole for recurrent pediatric brain cancers that&#xD;
      include medulloblastoma and high grade glioma, that are no longing responding to standard&#xD;
      therapies. The drug mebendazole is an oral drug in a chewable 500 mg orange flavored tablet.&#xD;
      It is already approved to treat parasitic infections. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      determine the safety and side effects for increasing doses of mebendazole, followed by the&#xD;
      treatment of an additional 12 patients at the best tolerated dose.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      oral mebendazole in patients with recurrent/progressive pediatric brain tumors and to confirm&#xD;
      the tolerance of the MTD of oral mebendazole by assessing tolerance in a dose expansion&#xD;
      cohort. Secondary Objectives of the study include to determine the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      toxicity of mebendazole in this patient population, determine the plasma levels of&#xD;
      mebendazole in this patient population and Determine progression-free and overall survival of&#xD;
      mebendazole in an extended cohort of patients with treatment refractory pediatric brain&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mebendazole (MBZ) is a drug developed to treat human helminthic disease and is FDA-approved&#xD;
      for the treatment of roundworm, common hookworm, American hookworm, pinworm and whipworm. MBZ&#xD;
      use is well documented and frequently used in tropical countries at higher doses for the&#xD;
      rarer parasitic infections of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have shown efficacy in preclinical laboratory models of high grade glioma and&#xD;
      medulloblastoma. Mebendazole therapy demonstrated safety in a phase I clinical trial for&#xD;
      adults with high grade gliomas such as glioblastoma. This trial completed the maximum&#xD;
      approved enrollment of 24 patients treated with mebendazole, with high doses consistent with&#xD;
      dosing published for severe parasitic infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory studies indicate that mebendazole enters the brain and brain tumors at&#xD;
      concentrations that may be effective for a combination of anti-cancer mechanisms. In animal&#xD;
      models of brain cancer evidence suggest that mebendazole can prevent cell proliferation by&#xD;
      interfering with tubulin formation, and it may prevent the formation of new abnormal blood&#xD;
      vessels that feed tumor growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients for this experimental trial are those between the age of 1 to 21 with the&#xD;
      diagnosis of medulloblastoma, or high grade glioma, where the tumor has resumed growth or&#xD;
      continued to grow despite standard medical therapy. High grade glioma are those with a World&#xD;
      Health Organization (WHO) grade of III or IV. It includes diagnosis of pediatric&#xD;
      glioblastoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. Patients who have&#xD;
      failed other forms of experimental therapy may also be eligible for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mebendazole is provided at no cost in the form of a chewable 500 mg tablets, recommended to&#xD;
      be taken three times daily with meals or food. The pill can be chewed after meals, or ground&#xD;
      up to be mixed with food or drink. It has a mild orange flavor that is similar in consistency&#xD;
      to an antacid tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although side effects are rare and the vast majority are reversible, they include stomach&#xD;
      upset, decreased blood count, and elevated liver enzymes due to inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main additional procedure beyond taking this drug, is that patients are requested to&#xD;
      consent to up to three additional blood draws to check the blood (serum) levels of the drug&#xD;
      to ensure it is being absorbed at sufficient doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients can continue to receive the drug as long as in the attending physicians opinion the&#xD;
      therapy is not causing any severe side effects, and there is no clear indication that the&#xD;
      patient will not respond to mebendazole therapy. Patients can withdraw from this trial at any&#xD;
      time for any reason, and may be eligible for other experimental therapies afterwards.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have a confirmed recurrent/progressive brain malignancy that have failed&#xD;
             at least one prior treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age for inclusion in this trial at time of patient enrollment is ≥ 1 year, and up to&#xD;
             21 years (prior to the 22nd birthday) with any of the recurrent medulloblastoma or&#xD;
             recurrent high grade glioma may be consented and treated under this protocol. Patients&#xD;
             who turn 22 during the course of the trial will continue to be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) &gt; 50% for patients ≥10 years of age. Lansky score of&#xD;
             ≥ 50 for children &lt; 10 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Life expectancy greater than 10 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Leukocytes ≥ 3,000 cells per microliter&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute Neutrophil Count ≥ 750 cells per microliter&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets ≥ 75,000 cells per microliter&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x upper&#xD;
                  limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine &lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine Clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73m2 for patients with creatinine &gt; 1.5 x&#xD;
                  upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The effects of mebendazole on the developing human fetus are unknown. In rats there is&#xD;
             evidence of a teratogenic effect, although there is no evidence of adverse effect from&#xD;
             women accidently taking mebendazole (at lower doses) during pregnancy. For this&#xD;
             reason, women of child-bearing potential should agree to use birth control while&#xD;
             taking mebendazole if there is a reasonable risk of pregnancy. Should a woman become&#xD;
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should&#xD;
             inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Ability for patient (and if applicable parent or legal guardian) understand and the&#xD;
             willingness to sign a written informed consent document, or for a parent or legal&#xD;
             guardian to give assent for those cases where a very young patient is unable to&#xD;
             understand or sign the consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. For the patient or parent/legal guardian to be able to comply with treatment plan,&#xD;
             study procedures and follow-up examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Failed any previous front line standard of care therapy that is currently used for the&#xD;
             patient's initial diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Ability to swallow pills, or liquid formulation and for patient or parent/legal&#xD;
             guardian to keep an accurate medication record.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients who have known allergy to mebendazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2 Patients who have previously had a severe side effect, such as agranulocytosis and&#xD;
        neutropenia, in conjunction with previous mebendazole or benzimidazole class drug for a&#xD;
        parasitic infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3 Patients who are taking metronidazole and cannot be safely moved to a different&#xD;
        antibiotic greater than 7 days prior to starting mebendazole therapy. Metronidazole and&#xD;
        mebendazole in combination have been associated with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome/Toxic&#xD;
        Epidermal Necrolysis in a case report.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4 Patients who have previously taken mebendazole as part of any experimental anti-cancer&#xD;
        protocol, and have failed this therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5 Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
        infection, uncontrolled hypertension, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina&#xD;
        pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, chronic hepatitis, acute hepatitis, or psychiatric&#xD;
        illness/social situation that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6 Pregnant women are excluded because mebendazole is a Class C agent with the potential for&#xD;
        teratogenic effects. Because it is not known if mebendazole is excreted in breast milk,&#xD;
        breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with mebendazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7 Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface antigen or&#xD;
        hepatitis C positive; or with a history of chronic active hepatitis or cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8 Patients with a history of any medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
        that in the opinion of the investigator may increase the risks associated with the study&#xD;
        participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with the&#xD;
        interpretation of the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9 Patients who are not available for follow-up assessments or unable to comply with study&#xD;
        requirements.&#xD;
