      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this present study is to investigate the effect of vinegar consumption on 24-hour&#xD;
      urinary risk factors associated with calcium oxalate urinary stone formation and blood&#xD;
      biochemical parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit 50 healthy young student volunteers in this study. By simple&#xD;
      random sampling technique, volunteers will be allocated to two groups (group 1, control&#xD;
      group; group 2, vinegar group).Each participant in vinegar group drink 15ml vinegar (&#xD;
      Ninghuafu, Sanxi, China) at noon and evening respectively for a period of four weeks.The end&#xD;
      point of this study is comparison the outcomes of 24-hour urine and blood biochemical&#xD;
      parameters between different group and point-in-time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The written history of vinegar use in China was more than 5,000 years,and it was used as&#xD;
      health care products since ancient times. In addition of the main component of acetic acid,&#xD;
      it also contains other acids, esters, polyphenols and other active substances.Previous&#xD;
      studies have reported some effects of vinegar, such as delays gastric emptying,relieves&#xD;
      fatigue, regulates blood glucose and lipid metabolism, antioxidant, reduces blood pressure&#xD;
      and so on. The China national epidemiological study of urolithiasis which was conducted from&#xD;
      May 2013 through July 2014 indicated that vinegar may be protective against the formation of&#xD;
      urolithiasis (has not been published). Animal experiments showed that vinegar could inhibit&#xD;
      oxalate calcium crystal formation in rat kidneys (has not been published). Consequently, we&#xD;
      performed this randomized controlled trial to investigate the effect of vinegar consumption&#xD;
      on 24-hour urinary risk factors associated with calcium oxalate urinary stone formation and&#xD;
      blood biochemical parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and participants: We will recruit 50 healthy young student volunteers in this&#xD;
      study. The inclusion criteria are male who age 18-35 years, and those with normal renal&#xD;
      function,without urolithiasis and congenital urinary tract abnormalities. The exclusion&#xD;
      criteria include hematuria, urinary tract infection and have a history of kidney or urinary&#xD;
      diversion. We exclude male older than 35 years because usually they have to work and not easy&#xD;
      to collect 24-hour sample. The reason of excluding female is that the trail will last four&#xD;
      weeks and women's menstrual cycle could affect 24-hour urine collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trained research clinicians enroll volunteers in a university nearby our hospital. Volunteers&#xD;
      will be allocated in a 1:1 ratio to control group(group 1) or vinegar group(group 2) by&#xD;
      simple random sampling technique, which is conducted by clinical trial office in urology&#xD;
      department of our hospital in Guangzhou, China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: Each participant in vinegar group drink 15ml vinegar ( Ninghuafu, Sanxi, China)&#xD;
      after dinner at noon and evening respectively for a period of four weeks,and participants in&#xD;
      control group do not need intervention.All of participants drink vinegar under the&#xD;
      surveillance of research clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data will be collected before randomization in our hospital. The baseline data&#xD;
      protocol includes urinary ultrasonography, spot urine examines, 24-hour urine analysis and&#xD;
      blood chemical examines. The parameters of 24-hour urine analysis include Ph, volume,&#xD;
      creatinine, oxalate, citrate, phosphate, uric acid, calcium, magnesium, sodium and chloride.&#xD;
      The standard blood analysis protocol included routine haematology, fasting serum glucose,&#xD;
      creatinine, urea, uric acid, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein,&#xD;
      triglycerides, alanine transaminase(ALT), total protein(TP), albumin, glutamyltransferase&#xD;
      (GGT) , serum total bile acid, cholesterol, sodium, potassium, calcium and chloride ions.&#xD;
      Another tube of blood samples are freeze in -80 degree refrigerator for further analysis of&#xD;
      oxidation of blood protein product(AOPP), malondialdehyde(MDA), glutathion&#xD;
      peroxidase(GSH-PX), superoxide dismutase(SOD) and catalase activity(CAT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up data include 24-hour urine analysis on the 7th, 14th, 21th and 28th day during this&#xD;
      period and blood biochemical examines on the 29th day. The protocol of 24-hour urine and&#xD;
      blood chemical examines is the same with baseline data. And participants will be asked to&#xD;
      make a record of meals for seven days.The ANOVA for repeated measures is used to perform the&#xD;
      data analysis.&#xD;
