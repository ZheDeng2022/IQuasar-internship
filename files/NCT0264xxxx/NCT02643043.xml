    <textblock>
      This comprehensive genomic analysis and biospecimen repository study incorporates Next&#xD;
      Generation Sequencing (NGS) of archival tumor tissue from 200 subjects with metastatic&#xD;
      urothelial cancer in support of several parallel goals. The immediate goal involves&#xD;
      generation of a comprehensive report identifying subject specific genetic mutations and/or&#xD;
      alterations based on NGS. Additionally, DNA and RNA extracted from tumor specimens and any&#xD;
      remaining blocks/slides from the NGS will be stored for future research. Long-term, the goal&#xD;
      of this endeavor is to support collaborative translational research projects in metastatic&#xD;
      urothelial cancer by allowing investigators to interrogate abstracted coded clinical data&#xD;
      linked to data from any biospecimen studies.&#xD;

      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PLAN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECT IDENTIFICATION AND CONSENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sites may approach all subjects who attend an appointment for evaluation of metastatic&#xD;
      urothelial cancer for inclusion. Study staff review consent documents with potential subjects&#xD;
      and answer any and all questions. If a subject desires additional time or wishes to delay&#xD;
      enrollment in the study, he/she is given a copy of the consent document and informed about&#xD;
      how to ask questions or enroll at a later date. If the subject chooses to participate in the&#xD;
      study, he or she signs the consent, and is given a copy for his or her own records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIOSPECIMEN COLLECTION AND PROCESSING:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When subjects are consented for entry into this study, they consent to access of any archival&#xD;
      tumor tissue (whether from the primary or any metastatic site) for genetic analysis. This&#xD;
      tissue is not de-identified at the time of testing so that a subject specific report may be&#xD;
      generated and sent to the treating physician. Further, subjects consent to the indefinite use&#xD;
      of their specimens and linked clinical information for ongoing or future biomedical research.&#xD;
      Additionally, sites inform subjects during the consent process that researchers may use their&#xD;
      information for genetic research including research on somatic or germline mutations. The&#xD;
      specimens and report provided to HCRN are de-identified and future analyses will be performed&#xD;
      on coded (de-identified) data/specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of Archived Tumor Samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the subject is consented, sites will request primary and/or metastatic archived&#xD;
           tumor tissue. The tissue specimen sent may come in the form of a block or slides. Needle&#xD;
           biopsy is also acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each institution can use its own standard operating procedure for the preparation of the&#xD;
           FFPE material. Each participating site will ship specimens accessed under GU15-217&#xD;
           directly to the lab performing the NGS analysis. Sites will also request corresponding&#xD;
           pathology report(s). A de-identified pathology report will then be sent to HCRN with the&#xD;
           tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of Blood for Research Purposes Only:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each subject will have 47 mL of blood collected and banked for future testing. 10mL of&#xD;
           the sample will be used for plasma for banking. 17 mL of the sample will be used for&#xD;
           PBMC isolation and cryopreservation. 20mL of the sample will be used for plasma for&#xD;
           cfDNA. Any DNA analysis of blood (including possible germline analysis) is for research&#xD;
           purposes only and will be performed on coded (de-identified) samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Report Generation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The subject specific report generated includes a summary of genomic alterations&#xD;
           highlighting those variations considered potentially actionable, a concise discussion of&#xD;
           the molecular analyses, a list of potential clinical trials incorporating relevant&#xD;
           targeted agents, and potential therapeutic options based on the specific alterations&#xD;
           discovered along with associated levels of evidence for each. The selection of clinical&#xD;
           trials and levels of evidence provided are based on extensive review and analysis of the&#xD;
           literature as well as a BCGC convened panel of experts in bladder cancer. This BCGC&#xD;
           expert panel will work with the NGS lab to ensure that all potential clinical trials are&#xD;
           represented in the individual subject reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Storage for Future Research:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The BCAN Biobank at Hoosier Cancer Research Network (HCRN) will store DNA and RNA&#xD;
           isolated for the study, additional FFPE and any biospecimens remaining after the NGS. If&#xD;
           at any point a subject wishes to withdraw from the study, the subject will contact their&#xD;
           study physician. HCRN will destroy any specimens that it may link to the subject. Once&#xD;
           specimens have been stripped of all identifying information or links to identifying&#xD;
           information they cannot be recalled to be destroyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COMMUNICATION OF NGS RESULTS TO PROVIDER AND SUBJECT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After NGS testing is complete, a subject specific report will be provided to the subject's&#xD;
      treating physician either in hard copy and/or via on-line portal (typically within 14&#xD;
      business days from receipt of tumor tissue) and a de-identified report to HCRN. If an&#xD;
      addendum is made to a report, an updated report will be provided to the treating physician&#xD;
      and HCRN in the manner described above. During the informed consent process, sites inform&#xD;
      each subject that his or her physician will communicate results of the genetic testing on&#xD;
      their tumor specimens. Along with the results that are communicated, the subjects' treating&#xD;
      physician will explain the implications of their testing results, including whether their&#xD;
      genetic profiles render them potentially eligible for a specific therapy or clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sites also inform subjects that researchers will store any specimens remaining after genetic&#xD;
      profiling of their tumor is complete. Storage continues indefinitely for future biomedical&#xD;
      research. This may include development of commercial products from their specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sites must explain to subjects that although a blood sample is being obtained, this study is&#xD;
      not aimed at discovering germline mutations. Sites must emphasize that genetic analyses&#xD;
      performed within this study should not be construed as genetic testing for genetic mutations&#xD;
      associated with hereditary cancer susceptibility. Nevertheless, because NGS may be performed&#xD;
      on blood, it is possible that a germline mutation that predisposes a subject to cancer will&#xD;
      incidentally be discovered. Subjects will not receive any information about such mutations,&#xD;
      however, as this analysis will be performed on de-identified samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ABSTRACTION OF MEDICAL RECORDS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research staff at each site abstracts clinical information from each subject and enters the&#xD;
      information into the web based clinical research platform (EDC system). Data abstracted&#xD;
      includes details on the following: demographics, cancer diagnosis, cancer stage, surgical and&#xD;
      medical management, any treatment decisions made in response to the NGS results communicated&#xD;
      to the physician and any response/longer term outcome data as a result of these treatment&#xD;
      decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACCESS TO DATA/SPECIMENS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The database links coded clinical and genetic data, creating a biospecimen and data&#xD;
      repository. These data, along with biospecimens stored at HCRN, will ultimately be available&#xD;
      for researchers with BCGC-approved and IRB-approved studies allowing access to these&#xD;
      data/specimens, and with HCRN managing the data, protecting the confidentiality of study&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
