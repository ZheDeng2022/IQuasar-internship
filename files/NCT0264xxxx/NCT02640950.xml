  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is an increasingly accepted neurostimulation- based&#xD;
      treatment for major depressive disorder. While there is a growing anecdotal database&#xD;
      supporting its use in bipolar depression the investigators propose to collect open label&#xD;
      efficacy and safety data in a small population of patients with clinically verified bipolar&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to screen patients with bipolar depression I or II, who are already&#xD;
      on acceptable mood stabilization. They may or may not be on antidepressants at the time of&#xD;
      screening but subjects on antidepressants would be taken off them before completing the&#xD;
      screening phase. Those patients who have a depression of at least moderate severity without&#xD;
      significant symptoms of activation or mania will be started on a course of open label TMS&#xD;
      treatment of up to 35 sessions. Safety and efficacy assessments will be done weekly. Patients&#xD;
      will complete a course of treatment when they meet remission criteria (MADRS score &lt; 10) or&#xD;
      at the end of 30 treatments, whichever comes first. Patient who are still judged to be&#xD;
      improving between treatment 25 and treatment 30 will be eligible to complete up to five&#xD;
      addition treatments as the discretion of each site's principal investigator. Patients who&#xD;
      meet response criteria (MADRS score decreases by at least 50%) will complete the full course&#xD;
      of 30 to 35 TMS sessions. Patients will be withdrawn for safety concerns, particularly the&#xD;
      onset of activation suggestive of mania or a mixed state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet response or remission criteria will be followed monthly for up to six&#xD;
      months to evaluate the durability of response. They will be on standard mood stabilizing&#xD;
      medications and psychotherapy per their clinician's discretion.&#xD;

    <description>A decrease in MADRS score of at lease 50% will be considered a response to treatment. A MADRS score of less than 10 will be considered remission. We will subdivide patients based on the diagnosis of either bipolar I or bipolar II to compare effectiveness between those groups.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A YMRS score of 14 or greater will be used for criteria of onset of manic symptoms. The patients will be separated based on their diagnostic category of either Bipolar I Disorder or Bipolar II Disorder.</description>

    <measure>Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) to calculate percentage of patients meeting response criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>HAM-D response criteria will be based off a HAM-D score drop of at least 50%. Remission HAM-D score will be 7 or less. For the patients meeting remission criteria, we will calculate the number of treatments required to achieve remission. Patients who only meet response criteria will be treated for 30 to 35 sessions.&#xD;
Responders and remitters will also be followed for six months after the final treatment to see the durability of response. Percentage of patients' meeting relapse criteria will be calculated.</description>

    <description>Remission criteria for the CGI score will be a 2 or less. For the patients meeting remission criteria, we will calculate the number of treatments required to achieve remission. Patients who only meet response criteria will be treated for 30 to 35 sessions.&#xD;
Responders and remitters will also be followed for six months after the final treatment to see the durability of response. Percentage of patients' meeting relapse criteria will be calculated.</description>

             and no longer than 3 years in length.&#xD;
