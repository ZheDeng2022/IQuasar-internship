      Peritoneal dialysis (PD) has become a well-established complementary alternative to&#xD;
      haemodialysis (HD) as first-line renal replacement modality. At department of Botucatu&#xD;
      Medical School, more than 60% of the chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5 patients are&#xD;
      started urgently on chronic dialysis due to late referral or unexpected deterioration of&#xD;
      residual renal function. These patients, although suitable for PD, were previously started on&#xD;
      HD using central venous catheter. Since July 2014 patients have been offered urgent start on&#xD;
      chronic PD right after PD-catheter insertion by percutaneous surgery, using Seldinger&#xD;
      technique. The main objective is to compare technique and patients survival on unplanned PD&#xD;
      vs. unplanned HD in the first 180 days. Methodology: Quasi experimental study which will&#xD;
      describe how acute PD will initiated using high volume PD until metabolic and fluid control&#xD;
      right after (&lt;48 h) PD catheter placement standard prescription for a 12 h overnight&#xD;
      automatic PD until hospital discharge and intermittent PD at dialysis unit family training.&#xD;

      1. Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a matter of global public health. Data from United&#xD;
           States of America (USA) has shown a steady increase in the number of patients on renal&#xD;
           replacement therapy (RRT). The census of the Brazilian Society of Nephrology (SBN)&#xD;
           showed 65,121 patients on dialysis program in 2005, while in 2011 there were 91,314 and&#xD;
           in 2013, there were more than 100,000 patients on dialysis in Brazil.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Among the methods of dialysis, nephrologists have two options: the peritoneal dialysis&#xD;
           (PD) and hemodialysis (HD), which is the most commonly used method in the world.&#xD;
           Although, historically, PD was widely used in nephrology, for not clear reasons it has&#xD;
           been underutilized in last years, especially in incident patients on RRT. In Brazil,&#xD;
           data from 2013 showed that 90.6% of chronic patients underwent HD and only 9.4% were&#xD;
           treated by PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Several studies have compared the differences between the two types of dialysis - PD vs.&#xD;
           HD - in incident patients on RRT. There is no evidence of the superiority of one method&#xD;
           over the other in regards to general mortality within the first two years of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recently, some authors have pointed out the impact of the vascular access used in the&#xD;
           mortality of incident patients in HD. These studies found that central venous catheters&#xD;
           (CVC) use is associated with reduced survival, especially in the first 90 days of RRT.&#xD;
           Furthermore, there is a greater risk of bacteremia, sepsis and hospitalizations in&#xD;
           patients using CVC when compared to patients using arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) or graft&#xD;
           or PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In this scenario, the PD appears as an option of unplanned initiation of chronic&#xD;
           dialysis. Starting dialysis in an unplanned manner is a frequent situation in dialysis&#xD;
           centre even for patients without or with a regular nephrology follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Unplanned dialysis initiation can be defined as an end-stage renal disease patient&#xD;
           beginning HD with no functional vascular access, using CVC or as the starting PD in less&#xD;
           than 7 days after peritoneal catheter implantation. It has been shown that unplanned&#xD;
           dialysis and using temporary HD catheters are independently associated with mortality in&#xD;
           incident dialysis patients. For no clear reasons, PD is underused in unplanned dialysis&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In Brazil, approximately 60% of incident patients on RRT have no definitive access and&#xD;
           need to be treated through CVC.&#xD;
&#xD;
           However, there are few studies that describe PD method as an immediate treatment option&#xD;
           in patients without functioning vascular access and only two small studies that compared&#xD;
           unplanned start of HD vs. PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Lobbedez et al followed by the 2-year period, 60 patients who started unplanned dialysis&#xD;
           - 34 patients treated by PD and 26 by HD. Among the patients who started on PD, no&#xD;
           significant difference in mechanical or infectious complications when compared to&#xD;
           patients who had &quot;rest time&quot; post-catheter insertion. There was no significant&#xD;
           difference between the two unplanned dialysis methods (HD x DP) in patients survival&#xD;
           (78.8% in the HD group vs. 82.9% in PD (p = 0.26). After adjusting for comorbidities&#xD;
           index, survival between the two groups remained similar.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Koch et al. evaluated 57 incident patients in unplanned HD and 66 in unplanned PD. HD&#xD;
           patients had more bacteremia than PD patients in the first 6 months of dialysis (21.1%&#xD;
           vs 3%, p &lt;0.01), which was associated with the use of CVC as initial access . However,&#xD;
           there was no significant difference in the mortality rates between the two methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
           So it is clearly needed to show that PD is a suitable method for unplanned dialysis&#xD;
           patients and that acute automated PD may help nephrologists to deal with patients&#xD;
           without any permanent vascular access at dialysis initiation. The investigators believe&#xD;
           that PD can offer the advantage of not using CVC, which can reduce the morbidity and&#xD;
           mortality of CKD patients. In addition, in October/2014, there was not vacancy for&#xD;
           incident patients on chronic HD in Dialysis Unit of University Hospital of Botucatu&#xD;
           Medical School, worrying fact for a high complexity service that has received an average&#xD;
           of 8 incident patients on RRT, monthly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The main objective of this study is to compare technique and patients survival on&#xD;
           unplanned PD vs. unplanned HD in the first 180 days of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study is also carried out:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To compare the rates of hospitalization and infectious related with PD vs HD.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine the impact on the PD and HD programs (growing or reduction)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Methodology 3.1. Patients: This study is a quasi experimental study that will evaluate&#xD;
           incident unplanned PD and HD patients at Dialysis Unit of Botucatu Medical School. In an&#xD;
           attempt to increase the use of PD for unplanned dialysis patients, a programme devoted&#xD;
           to this group of patients has been set up since 1 November 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria are CKD patients stage 5 (creatinine clearance &lt; 15 ml/min) requiring&#xD;
      dialysis treatment immediately. Unplanned HD was defined as initiation without definitive&#xD;
      vascular access and using CVC and unplanned PD as initiation in less than 48 hours after&#xD;
      implantation of the peritoneal catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Absolute contraindication to the PD method are: presence of recent abdominal surgery (less&#xD;
      than 30 days); multiple previous abdominal surgery (more than two); severe respiratory&#xD;
      insufficiency (FiO2&gt; 70%); abdominal infections; severe hyperkalemia with changes&#xD;
      characteristic in EKG; and acute pulmonary edema. These patients will be treated with HD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decision concerning the dialysis modality has been made according to the medical's&#xD;
      indications and patient's choice. The implant of Tenckhoff catheter will be held through the&#xD;
      percutaneous Seldinger technique by nephrology team. High volume PD (HVPD) will be used&#xD;
      during the first 7 days of PD in order to achieve metabolic and fluid control. The procedure&#xD;
      for acute PD has been published recently. When HD is the modality of choice, a temporary&#xD;
      catheter is inserted rapidly by nephrologist, at the bedside if necessary, and after one week&#xD;
      it will be changed to tunneled line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed by the same research team from the time of the peritoneal catheter&#xD;
      implantation until the outcome (stay in the method for a minimum period of 90 days, death,&#xD;
      transplantation, recovery of renal function or switch to HD due to technical failure or&#xD;
      infectious and mechanical complications without success with the treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2. Research Protocol: The study protocol will consist of clinical and laboratory data,&#xD;
      dialysis and monitoring of patients on PD and HD unplanned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2.1. General data:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identification: name, gender, age, color&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Etiology and stage of CKD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of co-morbidities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Start of unplanned dialysis (date)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Date of the peritoneal catheter or CVC implantation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complications during or after implantation of the catheter&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Start date of family training (PD method)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Date of the end of the family training (PD method)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of training days (PD method)&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2.2. Dialysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Dialysis indications&#xD;
&#xD;
      PD: Catheter implantation using the Seldinger technique&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prescription: HVPD to achieve adequate metabolic and fluid control. At this point,&#xD;
           patient will be discharged from hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intermitent PD on alternate days or daily: patients will be treated by PD at the&#xD;
           dialysis unit of the University Hospital every other day or every day, according to&#xD;
           their lab exams and clinic exam. Laboratorial exams will be performed weekly, until&#xD;
           their family be trained and home be prepared for the implementation of technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HD: on alternate days at Dialysis Unit&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2.3. Follow up of unplanned dialysis patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of mechanical and infectious complications related to PD or HD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Technique and patients survival&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3. Statistical Analysis: The sample size calculation was based on the assumption the&#xD;
      difference of 15% between patients undergoing unplanned PD and HD in outcomes as&#xD;
      hospitalization, infection and mortality. With a first-order error of 5% and a power of 80% a&#xD;
      sample size of 94 patients is needed in each treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the study protocol, the data will be entered in a spreadsheet and verified typographical&#xD;
      errors and their analysis will be performed using the statistical program SAS for Windows&#xD;
      (version 9.2: SAS Institute,Cary, NC, USA, 2012). Initially descriptive analysis will be done&#xD;
      for all patients treated in the period, calculated measures of central tendency and&#xD;
      dispersion for continuous variables and frequencies for categorical variables. Patients will&#xD;
      be separated into two groups according to initiation modality (unplanned PD group and&#xD;
      unplanned HD group) in order to evaluate the impact of unplanned PD on technique and patient&#xD;
      survival and on survival free of peritonitis. Intent-to-treat analysis will be used to&#xD;
      analyse patient survival. T-test will be used to compare parametric continue variables&#xD;
      between the two groups and Kruskal-Wallis test for nonparametric continue variables. Chi&#xD;
      Square will be used to compare categorical variable between the two groups. For the analysis&#xD;
      of repeated measures, asymmetric distribution (gamma) under the GENMOD procedure will be&#xD;
      used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study will be presented survival curves using Kaplan Meyer of patients and&#xD;
      the method during the monitoring period. Cox proportional hazards model was used to adjust&#xD;
      survival on baseline characteristics. The statistical difference was considered to be&#xD;
      significant for p &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
