      This research study is studying targeted immunotherapies as a possible treatment for&#xD;
      recurrent meningioma. The names of the study interventions involved in this study are&#xD;
      nivolumab and ipilimumab.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research is a Phase II clinical trial, which means it will test the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of nivolumab alone (Cohort 1) or in combination with ipilimumab (Cohort 2).&#xD;
      Both nivolumab and ipilimumab are antibodies (types of human protein) that work to stop tumor&#xD;
      cells from growing and multiplying by immunotherapy. Immunotherapy is trying to have the&#xD;
      body's own immune system work against tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nivolumab and ipilimumab have both been used in other research studies and information from&#xD;
      those other research studies suggests that these interventions may help to stop Meningioma&#xD;
      cells from growing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nivolumab is FDA approved to treat other types of cancers, but the FDA (the U.S. Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration) has not yet approved this intervention for this type of cancer. The FDA&#xD;
      has not approved the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab for your specific disease, but&#xD;
      it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;

             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of nivolumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason:&#xD;
&#xD;

             serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for method(s)&#xD;
             of contraception for the duration of treatment with study drug plus 7 months after the&#xD;
             last dose of Nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Investigators shall counsel WOCBP and male subjects who are sexually active with WOCBP&#xD;
             on the importance of pregnancy prevention and the implications of an unexpected&#xD;
             pregnancy Investigators shall advise WOCBP and male subjects who are sexually active&#xD;
             with WOCBP on the use of highly effective methods of contraception. Highly effective&#xD;
             methods of contraception have a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year when used consistently&#xD;
             and correctly.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At a minimum, subjects must agree to the use of two methods of contraception, with one&#xD;
             method being highly effective and the other method being either highly effective or&#xD;

                       partners of male subjects participating in the study may use hormone based&#xD;
                       contraceptives as one of the acceptable methods of contraception since they&#xD;
                       will not be receiving study drug&#xD;
&#xD;

                       have pregnancy tests. Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective&#xD;
                       contraception must be discussed in the event that the subject chooses to&#xD;
                       forego complete abstinence.&#xD;

                  &gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A brief course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (eg, contrast dye allergy) or&#xD;
                  for treatment of non-autoimmune conditions (eg, delayed-type hypersensitivity&#xD;

             years of start of study drug. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin,&#xD;
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone&#xD;
             potentially curative therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has evidence of interstitial lung disease or active, non-infectious pneumonitis;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug&#xD;
             administration, impair the ability of the subject to receive protocol therapy, or&#xD;
             interfere with the interpretation of study results examples include but are not&#xD;
             limited to symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has an active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 3 months&#xD;
             or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a syndrome that&#xD;
             requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents. Subjects with vitiligo, type 1&#xD;
             diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition requiring&#xD;
             hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, conditions not&#xD;
             expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger or resolved childhood&#xD;
             asthma/atopy would be exceptions to this rule. Subjects that require intermittent use&#xD;
             of bronchodilators or local steroid injections would not be excluded from the study.&#xD;
             Subjects with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement or Sjorgen's syndrome will&#xD;
             not be excluded from the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has an active infection requiring intravenous therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive test for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBV sAg) or detectable hepatitis&#xD;
             C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) indicating acute or chronic infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical History:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of intracranial abscess within 6 months prior to start of study therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known&#xD;
             acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NOTE: HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible&#xD;
             because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with Nivolumab. Appropriate&#xD;
             studies will be undertaken in participants receiving combination antiretroviral&#xD;
             therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergy to study drug components&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prisoners or participants who are involuntarily incarcerated;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because Nivolumab is an agent with the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with Nivolumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated&#xD;
             Nivolumab.&#xD;
