  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to investigate the effect of candesartan, a blood pressure medication,&#xD;
      on cognitive function and thinking skills in those who have early or mild memory&#xD;
      difficulties, also called mild cognitive impairment or MCI.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind placebo-control randomized clinical trial that compares candesartan to&#xD;
      placebo in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who also have positive&#xD;
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD) biomarkers. The investigators will assess if blocking the effect of&#xD;
      Ang II, a crucial mediator of neuro-vascular injury, using angiotensin receptor blockers&#xD;
      (ARBs) will address shortcomings of current treatment regimens. This study will also assess&#xD;
      the safety and dose-response of target engagement for treatment with escalating doses of&#xD;
      candesartan.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of hypotensive episodes</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Hypotension is defined as blood pressure &lt;100/40 mm Hg. Blood pressure will be measured according to the American Heart Association guidelines with the subject in the sitting position and rested for 5 minutes. An appropriate cuff size (covering 60% of upper arm length and 80% of arm circumference)will be used and correct cuff placement (1-2 inches above the brachial pulse on bare arm) will be ensured.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with symptoms of hypotension</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to report any symptoms of hypotension (dizziness, weakness and cough). All subjects will be given a telephone number to reach physician 24-hours per day to report symptoms they experience. The number of subjects reporting symptoms of hypotension will be recorded.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with elevated serum creatinine</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The levels of creatinine will be obtained from blood samples. Increased levels (&gt;2.5 mg/dl) are indicative of decreased renal function.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with hyperkalemia</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The levels of potassium will be obtained from blood samples (&gt;5.9meq/dl). Hyperkalemia is an indication of kidney dysfunction.</description>

    <measure>Change in Brain Perfusion</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging (ASL-MRI) images will be acquired using a custom 3D stack of interleaved spirals fast spin echo sequence and will be averaged in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Brain perfusion assesses the amount of blood uptake in different areas of the brain. Greater blood supply indicates increased brain activity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Hippocampal Volume</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging (ASL-MRI) images will be acquired using a custom 3D stack of interleaved spirals fast spin echo sequence and will be averaged in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Decreased hippocampal volume indicates functional deficits in the impacted brain areas.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Vasoreactivity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) is assessed with blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) MRI. Vasoreactivity (VR) is the slope of the regression between cerebral perfusion and end-tidal carbon dioxide (CO2), in ml/100g/min per millimeter of mercury (mm Hg) during normal and hypercapnia. Decreased vasoreactivity is associated with cognitive decline.</description>

    <measure>Change in Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The CDR rates each of the six general domains involving memory, orientation, judgment and problem-solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. An overall score, ranging from 0 to 3, can be calculated. A score of 0 = normal, 0.5 = very mild dementia, 1 = mild dementia, 2 = moderate dementia, and 3 = severe dementia.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in EXAMINER Assessment Phonemic Fluency Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Executive function is assessed using the phonemic fluency task of the EXAMINER Assessments. Participants list as many words as they can that begin with a particular letter, in 60 seconds. A greater number of words correctly meeting the task criteria indicate greater executive function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in EXAMINER Assessment Category Fluency Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Executive function is assessed using the category fluency task of the EXAMINER Assessments. Participants list as many words as they can that belong in a particular category, in 60 seconds. A greater number of words correctly meeting the task criteria indicate greater executive function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT) Delayed Recall Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT) is used to assess memory domains. Participants are read a list of 12 words and are asked to recall as many as they can remember. This is repeated for 3 trials followed by a 20 minute delay, and then participants are asked to recall as many words as they can. The delayed recall score ranges from 0 to 12 and higher scores indicate better memory.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Trail Making Test (TMT) Part B</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Trail Making Test assesses executive function. In Part B of the TMT participants connect circles labeled with letters and numbers, in ascending order. The score is the amount of time it takes for the participant to complete the task. The average time is 75 seconds and times greater than 273 seconds indicate a deficit with executive function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Trail Making Test (TMT) Part B - A</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>In Part A of the TMT participants connect circles labeled with numbers, in ascending order. The score is the amount of time it takes for the participant to complete the task. The TMT Part A score reflects visuoperceptual abilities and subtracting the score for Part A from the score from Part B provides a more accurate assessment of executive function. Lower scores indicate greater executive function.</description>
