    <textblock>
      In this Phase 1/2 study, the investigators will conduct a safety and efficacy study of the&#xD;
      combination of BMX-001 with standard radiation therapy (RT) and concurrent 5-fluorouracil&#xD;
      (5FU)/mitomycin in newly diagnosed Anal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ASCC) patients. The primary&#xD;
      objectives are: Phase 1 - is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BMX-001 in ASCC&#xD;
      patients receiving RT and concurrent 5FU/mitomycin chemotherapy.2. For phase II part: To&#xD;
      examine the impact of BMX-001 on the overall acute ≥ grade 3 toxicity rate of the normal&#xD;
      tissue including rectum, bladder, and skin in combination with RT and concurrent&#xD;
      5FU/mitomycin in treatment of newly diagnosed ASCC patients&#xD;

      In this Phase 1/2 study, the investigators will conduct a safety and efficacy study of the&#xD;
      combination of BMX-001 with standard radiation therapy (RT) and concurrent 5-fluorouracil&#xD;
      (5FU)/mitomycin in newly diagnosed Anal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ASCC) patients. At the time&#xD;
      of writing of this protocol amendment, another Phase 1 study using BMX-001 with concurrent&#xD;
      chemotherapy and radiation therapy in patient with newly diagnosed high-grade gliomas&#xD;
      (BMX-HGG-001) has completed. This clinical trial has demonstrated no adverse effects in&#xD;
      subcutaneous dosing up to 28 mg/subject load with half the loading dose (14 mg/subject) given&#xD;
      biweekly for 8 weeks in 12 subjects. Three subjects were enrolled and dosed with 42&#xD;
      mg/subject load with half the loading dose given biweekly for 8 weeks. Of these three&#xD;
      subjects, there was one dose-limiting toxicity of grade 3 tachycardia and grade 3&#xD;
      hypotension. The DLT in this subject occurred with the loading dose (42 mg sc). The patient&#xD;
      was treated with fluids and hospital admitted for observation for 24 hours during which time&#xD;
      the hypotension and tachycardia resolved. The cardiac rhythm was a sinus tachycardia and no&#xD;
      other cardiac toxicity was observed. The tachycardia was assumed to have resulted from&#xD;
      hypotension occurring following the sub-cutaneous injection of BMX-001 (42 mg). After the&#xD;
      loading dose of BMX-001 and the described DLT, the subject continued on study and experienced&#xD;
      no tachycardia or hypotension following administration of the subsequent 16 maintenance doses&#xD;
      (20 mg sc). The sponsor determined that the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of BMX-001 is 28&#xD;
      mg/subject load followed by 14 mg/subject twice a week for up to eight weeks. This is the&#xD;
      maximum dose that was tolerated with no adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common related toxicity seen in the Phase 1 BMX-HGG-001 trial was grade 1 injection&#xD;
      site reaction. There is no apparent toxicity to end organ tissues or bone marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The completion of a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with high-grade glioma undergoing&#xD;
      brain radiation therapy plus chemotherapy with temozolomide has established the RP2D for&#xD;
      BMX-001. The RP2D by sub-cutaneous injection is 28 mg/subject load followed by a maintenance&#xD;
      dose of 14 mg/subject b.i.w. At the RP2D, there have been no BMX-001 dose limiting toxicities&#xD;
      observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the completion of Phase 1 and establishment of a RP2D for this treatment regimen in&#xD;
      patients undergoing radiation therapy and chemotherapy, the clinical trial described in this&#xD;
      protocol of patients with newly diagnosed ASCC will proceed to Dose Level 3, after completion&#xD;
      of Dose Level 1 and Dose Level 2, enrolling up to 20 subjects with a safety lead-in of 6&#xD;
      subjects. The reason for the safety lead-in is to confirm safety in subjects in this cohort&#xD;
      receiving radiation therapy and 5FU/mitomycin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of BMX-001 in combination with current&#xD;
      chemoradiation, blood samples will be drawn for analysis in the a minimum of three and up to&#xD;
      6 patients in enrolled in the safety lead-in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, the first dose of BMX-001 will be administered subcutaneously from 4 days up&#xD;
      to 1 hour prior to the start of radiation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be drawn for PK on the following days: Day 1 (before and after loading dose), Day&#xD;
      8, Day 22 and Day 36. Measures will be obtained at approximately the following times: -1 to 0&#xD;
      hour (before loading dose), 30 minutes after the drug is given, 4 hours post-dose, and 24&#xD;
      hours post-dose. This is described in Appendix A. Samples will be analyzed for BMX-001 using&#xD;
      validated analytical methods at Dr. Ivan Spasojevic's laboratory at Duke University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin, GI, and GU symptoms will be measured on the day of screening, weekly during RT, 1&#xD;
      months, 4 months and 10 months after the completion of RT. Perianal skin will be assessed&#xD;
      weekly during RT, 1 month, 4 months, and 10 months after completion of RT. Further follow up&#xD;
      will be per standard of care.&#xD;
