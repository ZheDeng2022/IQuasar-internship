  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study applies an one-group pre-posttest design. Primary family caregivers of ICU&#xD;
      patients are recruited. After obtaining an informed consent form from each participant, he or&#xD;
      she participates in an individual 1-hour singing-based music therapy intervention. At pre-&#xD;
      and posttest, the changes in the level of depression, anxiety, and emotional states are&#xD;
      measured.&#xD;

      -  Background: Family caregivers of ICU patients experience high level of distress due to&#xD;
           the severity of illness that their family members demonstrate and the perceived&#xD;
           limitation in control during their caregiving. This psychological issue in family&#xD;
           caregivers have been documented to affect not only the caregivers' psychosocial health&#xD;
           but also the quality of care for patients, which would also be influencing factors for&#xD;
           treatment outcomes of patients. As such, family-centered care has been emphasized in&#xD;
           related professions. Intervention efforts for family caregivers are also of interest.&#xD;
           Given that music has been evidenced to effectively alleviate emotional stress of&#xD;
           caregivers and that musical activities can be used in an individualized way at different&#xD;
           levels, the use of music for addressing psychosocial needs of this population is&#xD;
           potential. Among musical activities, singing is one of the most common activities and&#xD;
           also available in everyday life regardless of the level of musical background in the&#xD;
           past, which increases the possibility to utilize it as a personal strategy for&#xD;
           individuals with a broad range of musical experiences and music use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Purpose: This study aimed to examine the changes in the level of depression, anxiety,&#xD;
           and emotional states of family caregivers of ICU patients after participation in&#xD;
           singing-based music therapy intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention: Singing-based music therapy program consists of the sequences of the&#xD;
           following: (1) listening to a participant's preferred music and identifying his and her&#xD;
           emotional states, (2) singing for emotional changes, and (3) discussing what he or she&#xD;
           experiences during singing and identifying how they apply such experience to their&#xD;
           personal use of music for emotional changes in his or her everyday life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measures: In order to examine the changes in the perceived psychological health after&#xD;
           participation in singing-based intervention, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression&#xD;
           Scale (CES-D), State Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and a 100mm visual analog scale for&#xD;
           ratings on emotional state are administered. Also, in order to identify and control the&#xD;
           effect of level of caregiving burden on current emotional states, Subjective Caregiving&#xD;
           Burden Scale is administered.&#xD;

CES-D is the self-administered scale and consists of Likert-type 20 items on depressed affect, positive affect, somatic activity, and interpersonal relationship. The value measured from this scale indicates a level of depressive symptoms.</description>
