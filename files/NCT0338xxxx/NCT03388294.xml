      This study entails a &quot;proof of concept&quot; evaluation of a novel intervention, Parents and&#xD;
      Infants Engaged (PIE), for prodromal infants at-risk for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDs).&#xD;
      The objectives of the current study are to examine whether the PIE intervention (a)&#xD;
      transforms parent-infant transactions over time as intended, thereby facilitating increases&#xD;
      in the time infants spend in joint engagement with their parents, and (b) is associated with&#xD;
      improved social-communication functioning and positive changes in indices of autonomic&#xD;
      self-regulation in infants at-risk for NDs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Providing intervention during infancy, before the full emergence of the symptoms that would&#xD;
      lead to a diagnosis of ND based on a behavioral phenotype (e.g., autism spectrum disorder&#xD;
      (ASD), language disorder, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) is supported by 4&#xD;
      premises: (1) The first two years of life are an especially active period of neural&#xD;
      development. Due to rapid synaptic proliferation and experientially-influenced shaping of&#xD;
      functional connectivity, interventions initiated in infancy may be powerful in promoting more&#xD;
      typical neural connectivity (2) Biologically-based differences in infants at-risk for NDs&#xD;
      lead to observable differences in sensory reactivity and communication behaviors in most&#xD;
      infants by 9-15 months, prior to the full emergence of diagnostic symptoms. (3) Differences&#xD;
      in infant behaviors influence the quantity and quality of parent responses. (4) Parent-child&#xD;
      transactional processes begin early in infancy and impact long-term child outcomes. Based on&#xD;
      these premises, the investigators propose a &quot;proof of concept&quot; evaluation of a novel&#xD;
      intervention, Parents and Infants Engaged (PIE), for prodromal infants at-risk for NDs. PIE&#xD;
      is designed to directly impact parent responses to behaviors commonly observed in infants&#xD;
      at-risk for NDs. Without intervention, these behaviors may fail to elicit parent responses&#xD;
      that efficiently scaffold child communication development. Extensive research shows positive&#xD;
      associations between caregiver responsiveness and child communication outcomes.&#xD;
      Responsiveness is defined by multiple dimensions (i.e., sensitivity, contingency,&#xD;
      encouragement, matching interests/activity level, physical affection, quality of language&#xD;
      input [e.g., verbal scaffolding], reciprocity, and shared control), which vary within and&#xD;
      across caregivers. Children play an active role in eliciting responses from caregivers,&#xD;
      emphasizing the co-regulatory or transactional nature of these interactions. This includes&#xD;
      biobehavioral co-regulation of arousal levels. Whereas much research comes from studies of&#xD;
      typical development, similar transactions occur with young children with NDs. Parent&#xD;
      responses vary depending on the preceding behaviors of the child. For example, parents are&#xD;
      more likely to respond, and to give a verbal response, to their one-year-olds' gestures than&#xD;
      nongestural communicative bids (vocalizations, gaze, actions); also, adults are more likely&#xD;
      to respond to infants' speech-like than nonspeech-like vocalizations. Parent responsiveness,&#xD;
      in turn, predicts communication outcomes of children with varied NDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Evaluate the differential changes in attuned parent responsiveness following&#xD;
      coaching on two PIE domains - responses to variable infant (a) sensory reactivity (SR) or (b)&#xD;
      prelinguistic communication (PC) - as well as cumulative changes in attuned parent responses&#xD;
      following coaching on both PIE domains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Estimate the separate and combined effects of PIE intervention domains on&#xD;
      parent-infant engagement and infant-initiated communication with parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: Determine the extent to which autonomic indices of infant self-regulation&#xD;
      change over the course of the PIE intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify infants at-risk for neurodevelopmental disorders, the investigators will use a&#xD;
      population-screening method based on birth records in North Carolina, supplemented with&#xD;
      distribution of postcards/flyers through physician's offices and public health clinics and&#xD;
      email and listserv announcements. Completed First Year Inventories (FYIs) will be scored and&#xD;
      screened for risk status. Infants who score at-risk will be flagged, and those families will&#xD;
      receive a phone call informing them of the results of the screening (by a qualified/trained&#xD;
      project coordinator), and they will be invited for a more comprehensive developmental&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;

&#xD;
      The intervention phases of the study will use a randomized comparative trial design, with two&#xD;
      phases. For Intervention Study Phase 1, dyads will participate in the Pretest assessment&#xD;
      battery; then the project methodologist will randomize families of eligible infants,&#xD;
      stratifying randomization by age (&lt;13 months, 30 days or â‰¥ 14 months). Families will be&#xD;
      randomized to one of two treatment arms: Arm 1 families will participate in initial coaching&#xD;
      on the SR domain of PIE, and Arm 2 families will participate in initial coaching on the PC&#xD;
      domain of PIE. Families will participate in 6 coaching sessions in their respective treatment&#xD;
      arms, and then return for Posttest-1 (to test the separate impacts of the PIE content domains&#xD;
      on parent responses and infant outcomes). For Intervention Study Phase 2, dyads in Arm 1,&#xD;
      will receive 6 coaching sessions on the PC domain, and dyads in Arm 2 will receive 6 coaching&#xD;
      sessions on the SR domain; coaching for each group will also review their respective content&#xD;
      domain coached in Intervention Study Phase 1. Then families will return for Posttest-2 (to&#xD;
      evaluate the effects of the full PIE intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to COVID-19 restrictions, intervention may be carried out via video-conference platform&#xD;
      for no more than one session. Parent-report questionnaires only will be collected in lieu of&#xD;
      in-person assessments for Posttest-2 for participants unable to attend in-person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be cleaned and inspected for outliers, missing data and distributional&#xD;
      irregularities. Where error distributions potentially deviate from normality, or&#xD;
      heteroscedasticity is suspected, the tests of the contrasts will be conducted using exact&#xD;
      (resampling-based) nonparametric methods. Proportional outcomes will be arc sin transformed&#xD;
      before entering them into the models. For the frequency count outcome, if counts are not&#xD;
      sufficiently large (e.g., â‰¥ 8) that a normal approximation to a Poisson error distribution is&#xD;
      appropriate, Poisson or negative binomial regression methods or nonparametric approaches may&#xD;
      be employed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All primary analyses will be conducted to explore a priori contrasts of interest within a&#xD;
      repeated measures framework. Of primary interest will be the contrast of Pretest to&#xD;
      Posttest-1 scores and the contrast of Pretest to Posttest-2 scores (time effect). In&#xD;
      addition, the models will include terms for treatment arm effects and treatment arm-by-time&#xD;
      interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Posttest-1, the investigators anticipate statistically significant time, treatment arm,&#xD;
      and arm-by-time interactions, with parents showing differentially greater attuned responses&#xD;
      to infant SR or PC, consistent with their respective treatment arm. By Posttest-2, however,&#xD;
      the investigators predict group equivalence in responsiveness, with no differential time&#xD;
      effects. A follow-up test of the contrast between Posttest-1 and Posttest-2 will verify that&#xD;
      parents in Arm 1 maintained their attuned SR responsiveness gains, while parents in Arm 2&#xD;
      &quot;caught up&quot; on attuned SR responsiveness, and vice versa for PC attunement. For H2a, the&#xD;
      investigators expect increases in joint engagement from Pretest to Posttest-1, with&#xD;
      additional increases at Posttest-2 (time effects), and no differential treatment arm effects&#xD;
      or interactions at either Posttest. For H2b, the investigators anticipate minimal increases&#xD;
      in infant intentional communication at Posttest-1 in either treatment arm, with comparable&#xD;
      improvements (time effects) in each group at Posttest-2. Similarly, on the physiological&#xD;
      measures addressing H3a (measured only at Pretest and Posttest-2) the investigators&#xD;
      anticipate comparable improvements in RSA and SCL (time effect) in both arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the investigators are performing multiple statistical tests across outcomes and&#xD;
      hypotheses in addressing the specific aims, in this project it is more important to avoid&#xD;
      overlooking statistical signals of effectiveness of the innovative PIE intervention approach&#xD;
      (Type II errors), than avoiding false assertions of effectiveness (Type I errors). The&#xD;
      investigators believe it is premature, therefore, to employ conservative adjustments to the&#xD;
      Type I error rates in statistical tests, which would compromise the power of statistical&#xD;
      tests to detect such signals. Assuming recruitment of 44 infant-parent dyads and allowing for&#xD;
      a 9% (n=4) dropout rate, which is consistent with high retention rates (&gt; 95%) in our prior&#xD;
      intervention studies, 40 dyads (20 per treatment arm) will have complete data for analyses.&#xD;
      Assuming a conventional Type I error rate of .05, and intercorrelations among the repeated&#xD;
      measures from .3 to .7, the magnitude of treatment group effects detectable with a .80&#xD;
      statistical power will range from f=.37 to .42, respectively, which are large standardized&#xD;
      effects. The magnitude of time effects and time-by-treatment arm interaction effects&#xD;
      detectable with a .80 power will range from .27 to .18, also respectively, which are&#xD;
      medium-sized standardized effects. Thus, the study is underpowered to detect any but large&#xD;
      differences between the treatment arms and medium-sized or larger effects on time and time-by&#xD;
      treatment arm interactions. More importantly than the statistical comparisons, though, the&#xD;
      analyses will yield key descriptive characterizations of the treatment-arm effects at the two&#xD;
      posttest points (i.e.,means, medians, proportions, and variances) on key outcomes, as well as&#xD;
      effect size estimates that can be used in planning a larger scaled efficacy trial of the PIE&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Mean Percent of Parent Child Dyadic Engagement Over Time From Baseline to Posttest 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Posttest 1 (6-8 weeks after baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>This system entails continuous coding of infants' attention engagement into one of 6 mutually exclusive states: unengaged, onlooking, object engaged, person-engaged, supported joint engagement, and coordinated joint engagement. Due to the importance of the construct of engagement to our PIE theory of change, the total percent of time in dyadic engagement (higher level supported + coordinated) will serve as the most proximal intervention outcome (i.e., changes expected at Posttest-1). Recent studies with children with NDs have shown that the coding system is sensitive to change in joint engagement after relatively short interventions.</description>

&#xD;
          -  For the intervention trial: infant must meet risk criteria on the First Years&#xD;
             Inventory (Calculated based on data collected in another study where risk status on&#xD;
             the FYI was confirmed with follow up at 3 years. We empirically determined&#xD;
             combinations of the two FYI domain scores that would sort respondents into &quot;at-risk&quot;&#xD;
             and &quot;not-at-risk.&quot; The resulting cut-points enabled us to sort children such that we&#xD;
             capture about 1/3 of those who would go on to be confirmed as having a autism spectrum&#xD;
             diagnosis while misclassifying less than 5% of the typically developing (TD) sample as&#xD;
             at-risk). Infants also must score at least one s.d. below the mean on either the&#xD;
             Receptive or Expressive subscale t scores AND meet the following SPA inclusion&#xD;
             criteria on hyporeactivity (HYPO) or hyperreactivity (HYPER):&#xD;

        <title>Change in Mean Percent of Parent Child Dyadic Engagement Over Time From Baseline to Posttest 1</title>
        <description>This system entails continuous coding of infants' attention engagement into one of 6 mutually exclusive states: unengaged, onlooking, object engaged, person-engaged, supported joint engagement, and coordinated joint engagement. Due to the importance of the construct of engagement to our PIE theory of change, the total percent of time in dyadic engagement (higher level supported + coordinated) will serve as the most proximal intervention outcome (i.e., changes expected at Posttest-1). Recent studies with children with NDs have shown that the coding system is sensitive to change in joint engagement after relatively short interventions.</description>

        <title>Change in Rate of Infant Intentional Communication Over Time, Baseline to Posttest 1</title>
        <description>Rate of child intentional communication during parent-child interaction, coded from videos. Video recordings of parent-child interactions were coded for infants' intentional communication acts (i.e., acts directed to the parent): vocalizations, gestures, or both (acts combining vocalizations and gestures).

        <description>Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA) levels will be collected using a standard protocol while the child is seated in a high chair exposed to social and non-social stimuli. RSA indexes the variability in heartrate that is associated with respiratory inspiration and expiration. RSA levels are expected to increase with development during exposure to both social and nonsocial stimuli in the context of this protocol. Higher RSA levels during exposure to social stimuli involving child-directed speech have been predictive of better language outcomes in previous studies of preschoolers diagnosed with autism.</description>

        <title>Change in The Behavioral Observation of Social Communication Change (BOSCC) From Baseline to Posttest 2</title>
        <description>A treatment response measure of social communication behaviors and other behaviors associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Administration of the BOSCC involves a 12-minute video recorded interaction between an examiner and a young child using two standard sets of toys and play with bubbles. Behaviors are coded from video. Total score range is 16-80. Higher scores indicate more atypical social communication skills, lower scores indicate better skills.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Posttest 2 (13-16 weeks after baseline)</time_frame>
        <population>Some video durations were too short to qualify for scoring per BOSCC protocol. Data were unavailable for 7 enrolled children at Baseline and 8 enrolled children for Posttest 2. The majority of enrolled children (i.e., 25) had data available at both timepoints; 4 enrolled children had data at Baseline only; 3 enrolled children at Posttest 2 only; and 4 enrolled children had no data available at either timepoint.</population>

        <title>Change in Sensory Processing Assessment for Young Children From Baseline to Posttest 2 in Hypo-Reactivity</title>
        <description>A play-based assessment used to measure children's approach-avoidance to novel sensory toys (i.e., hyper-reactivity) and orienting responses (i.e., hypo-reactivity) across three sensory modalities (auditory, visual, tactile). The investigators will report a mean score for Hypo (range = 1-5) and Hyper (range = 1-5) sensory subscales. Higher scores indicate greater sensory differences in that domain (e.g. a high hypo domain score would indicate more hyposensitive reactions to sensory stimuli seen in the child).</description>
