    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter uncontrolled, open-label, prospective, non-comparative randomized,&#xD;
      phase II study. Patients will be randomized between darolutamide in Arm n°1 (two-stage&#xD;
      Simon's design) and capecitabine in Arm n°2 with two patients randomized in Arm n°1 for one&#xD;
      patient randomized in Arm n°2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial population is composed of women over 18 years old with triple-negative and androgen&#xD;
      receptor positive, locally recurrent (unresectable) or metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
