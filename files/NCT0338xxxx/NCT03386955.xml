  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer has the highest incidence rate in China and is also a very common cancer in the&#xD;
      world. BPI-7711 is a new drug developed for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy and PK profile of BPI-7711. The&#xD;
      first part of the study will recruit 3~6 patients for different dose levels to evaluate&#xD;
      safety. The dose will increase from the lowest level. The second part of the study is the&#xD;
      dose expansion. Once efficacy is observed in the dose increasing process, additional 20~30&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled to further evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy. A recommended dose&#xD;
      will be selected for Phase II study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open label study, including phase I (a &quot;dose escalation&quot; part and a&#xD;
      &quot;dose extension&quot; part) and phase IIa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation: on the basis of the traditional &quot;3+3&quot; dose escalation plan; single dose PK&#xD;
      test is added. The subjects of each dose group will first be given a single dose, and blood&#xD;
      samples be collected for PK analysis. 7 days (wash-out period) after single dose delivery, an&#xD;
      additional 21 days of continuous multiple dose delivery will be given as a treatment cycle to&#xD;
      evaluate the dose limiting toxicity (DLT). The initial dose will be 30 mg once a day. In the&#xD;
      initial dose group, the second subject will be enrolled and administered with the study drug&#xD;
      7 days after the first dosing (single dose) to the first subject. If there is no occurrence&#xD;
      of serious or unexplainable safety event, the subsequent following-up subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled and receive the dose. If suspected safety event occurs, the investigator will&#xD;
      discuss with the sponsor whether to delay dose delivery to the following-up subjects of the&#xD;
      said group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every dose escalation group will enroll 3 to 6 subjects. Dose adjustment will be based on the&#xD;
      following scheme:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If there is 0 case of DLT in 3 subjects of the initial dose group in the first treatment&#xD;
           cycle, then the treatment dose of the subsequent 3 patients will be increased to level&#xD;
           2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If there is 1 case of DLT in 3 subjects of the initial dose group in the first treatment&#xD;
           cycle, then additional 3 patients will be enrolled in the group and accept the level 1&#xD;
           dose treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If there is 0 case of DLT in the 3 new subjects, the dose will be increased to&#xD;
                level 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If there is ≥1 case of DLT in the 3 new subjects, the principal investigator and&#xD;
                the sponsor will discuss to determine the next step dose scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If there are ≥2 cases of DLT in 3 subjects of the initial dose group, the principal&#xD;
           investigator and the sponsor will meet to discuss the alternative dose delivery scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same dose escalation rules shall be applicable to the following dose groups. Based on&#xD;
      available tolerance, safety, and PK data, recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) will be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose extension group: If a certain dose is found to be safe and effective, dose expansion&#xD;
      will be initiated and about 20-30 subjects will be enrolled into that dose level. There will&#xD;
      be no DLT evaluation for subjects of the dose extension study.&#xD;
