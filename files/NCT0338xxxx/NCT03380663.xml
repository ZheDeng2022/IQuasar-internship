    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to uncover and utilize the mechanisms behind the&#xD;
      activation of endogenous organ protection by remote ischemic conditioning (RIC), high&#xD;
      intensity traditional resistance training (TRT) and low intensity blood flow restricted&#xD;
      resistance exercise (BFRE) with the perspective of defining their applicability for immediate&#xD;
      organ protection in ischemia-reperfusion injury (acute conditioning) and subsequent tissue&#xD;
      repair (chronic conditioning) during a prolonged recovery period. This objective will be&#xD;
      achieved by studying which and how molecular pathways underlying these protective mechanisms&#xD;
      are shared and can be transferred to treat medical conditions. A specific focus is the roles&#xD;
      of EVs and miRNAs. Another objective is to explore how exercise training with and without&#xD;
      ischemia can counteract muscle wasting.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical background - ischemia related and inflammatory conditions The pandemic of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease has immense negative effects on global population health and life&#xD;
      expectancy. The most detrimental acute ischemic events are myocardial infarction and stroke.&#xD;
      Organ failure caused by ischemia-reperfusion syndromes such as stroke and myocardial&#xD;
      infarction constitutes the leading cause of death globally and carry a vast socio-economical&#xD;
      burden. Overall, 17 million people worldwide are estimated to die from cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases (7.4 million from ischemic heart disease and 6.7 million from stroke). Attempts to&#xD;
      modify risk factor and life style related growth in cardiovascular disease are important and&#xD;
      have been successful in some parts of the world, but improved treatment of acute and chronic&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease is crucial to alleviate the disease burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In acute ischemic conditions such as myocardial infarction and stroke, early and successful&#xD;
      restoration of tissue perfusion following an ischemic event is the most effective strategy to&#xD;
      reduce tissue injury and improve clinical outcome, but reperfusion may induce further tissue&#xD;
      damage itself, so-called reperfusion injury. Although reperfusion strategies continue to&#xD;
      progress with improved logistics and medical treatment, even optimal acute reperfusion&#xD;
      treatment may leave patients with chronic ischemic disease. Actually, as initial survival has&#xD;
      improved due to improvements in acute reperfusion therapy, the number of patients with&#xD;
      chronic ischemic heart disease is growing globally (more than 35 million people worldwide&#xD;
      suffering from heart failure). Collectively, patients with heart failure have a poorer 5-year&#xD;
      survival rate than patients with most types of cancer. However, the development of effective&#xD;
      drugs to target the detrimental effects of reperfusion injury itself has proven to be a&#xD;
      challenge. Several pharmacologic strategies showing convincing effects in animal models of&#xD;
      ischemia-reperfusion injury have failed to translate into clinical benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A key feature of heart failure caused by chronic ischemic heart disease is inflammation,&#xD;
      which shares mechanisms with other inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease&#xD;
      and ankylosing spondylitis. Further debilitating, heart failure also exerts a negative effect&#xD;
      on habitual physical activity and skeletal muscle tissue health, producing multiple&#xD;
      detrimental effects on whole-body metabolism and mobility. A common underlying mechanistic&#xD;
      trait of these processes could be regulation by circulating small non-coding RNAs (micro RNAs&#xD;
      or miRNAs/miRs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific background Remote ischemic conditioning The main prognostic determinant of outcome&#xD;
      in acute myocardial infarction is the extent of tissue damage (infarct size), which is&#xD;
      determined not only by the duration of ischemia but also by injury caused by reperfusion&#xD;
      injury. Remote Ischemic Conditioning (RIC) is a new treatment modality to attenuate&#xD;
      reperfusion injury. Organ protection by RIC can be achieved simply by inducing 3 or 4&#xD;
      five-minute cycles of limb ischemia and reperfusion using a tourniquet or simple blood&#xD;
      pressure cuff. With few exceptions, RIC has consistently been shown to exert powerful&#xD;
      protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury in the heart, brain, kidneys, lungs, and liver&#xD;
      in animal models, and RIC has successfully been translated into clinical use. A specific&#xD;
      advantage of RIC is its easy applicability during ongoing ischemia of the target organ, which&#xD;
      has been exploited in animal models and humans to show that RIC reduces injury during&#xD;
      evolving myocardial infarction and stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the mediators and mechanisms of RIC remain to be identified, RIC has been shown to 1)&#xD;
      induce cytoprotection, 2) improve endothelial function and microcirculation, and 3) modify&#xD;
      inflammation - all three key players in the pathology behind heart failure - suggesting a&#xD;
      potentially powerful tool to simultaneously counteract detrimental biological processes&#xD;
      involved in the development of heart failure. RIC may have further potential because&#xD;
      continued RIC after myocardial infarction seems to induce sustained benefits during the&#xD;
      following adverse remodeling of the heart. The anti-inflammatory effects may be of importance&#xD;
      in other conditions involving acute or chronic inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ischemia and conditioning with blood flow restricted resistance exercise Exercise is&#xD;
      traditionally categorized and practiced as either oxygen-demanding aerobic endurance exercise&#xD;
      with effect on metabolic properties or mechanically stressing resistance exercise with effect&#xD;
      on contractile properties. In addition to local myocellular effects, exercise appears to&#xD;
      promote molecular inter-organ communication. Indeed, recent studies have demonstrated the&#xD;
      ability of traditional exercise regimens to protect against e.g. myocardial&#xD;
      ischemia-reperfusion injury and also to improve cognitive function, hence the conception that&#xD;
      &quot;exercise is medicine&quot;. Studies suggest that these remote effects are induced by myocellular&#xD;
      production of circulatory mediators to influence tissues of remote organs. Exercise-induced&#xD;
      muscle-organ cross-talk may, similar to RIC, rely on extracellular vesicle derived miRNA (see&#xD;
      next paragraph). Supporting such a notion, is the finding that high intensity traditional&#xD;
      resistance exercise evokes increased transcription of miR133b, since miR133b has recently&#xD;
      been demonstrated to promote recovery after stroke via transfer of exosome-enriched&#xD;
      extracellular particles. However, high intensity traditional exercise can produce muscle&#xD;
      injury and may therefore not comply with exercise in patients with cardiovascular or other&#xD;
      chronic muscle wasting diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A novel approach may be offered by Ischemic resistance exercise training conducted as&#xD;
      low-intensity blood flow restricted resistance exercise (BFRE), with a low occlusion pressure&#xD;
      stimulus, which only compromises venous but not arterial blood flow. Much like RIC, BFRE is&#xD;
      conducted as 3-5 cycles (sets of exercise) interspaced by short duration of recovery. By this&#xD;
      mechanically very gentle approach, muscle accretion similar to that of high intensity&#xD;
      traditional resistance training (TRT) can be achieved, possibly due to acceleration of&#xD;
      metabolic build-up or activation of muscle stem cells. Interestingly, new results by us,&#xD;
      demonstrate that BFRE can mediate long-lasting preconditioning effects in muscle. Since&#xD;
      low-intensity BFRE mimics events of both traditional high intensity resistance exercise&#xD;
      (occlusion-reperfusion) and traditional aerobe exercise (hypoxia), BFRE can be speculated to&#xD;
      drive health beneficial metabolic as well as anabolic adaptations in the muscle. Based on its&#xD;
      resemblance to RIC, BFRE likely also affect remote tissues and infer remote organ protection.&#xD;
      The extent to which RIC and exercise regimens may share or overlap or differ mechanistically&#xD;
      - and potentially exert additive effects - is unknown, but application of BFRE entails highly&#xD;
      promising clinical perspectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Micro RNA signaling Circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small particles released&#xD;
      from plasma membranes from almost all cell types. These EVs seem to act as transport systems&#xD;
      in the body carrying a cargo of signaling substances including miRNAs. miRNAs are also&#xD;
      effector molecules in ischemic events, e.g. myocardial miRNA144 (miR144) levels are reduced&#xD;
      by ischemic reperfusion injury (IR injury), which is attenuated by RIC. RIC also induces&#xD;
      increased circulatory EV levels, while EVs enriched with miR22 and miR451 from anoxic&#xD;
      cultured MSCs and cardiomycyte progenitor cells mitigate cardiac injury. Potentially,&#xD;
      treatment with specific miRNA loaded into EVs may provide protection against acute and&#xD;
      chronic effects of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in patients [19]. EVs are also&#xD;
      believed to contain other substances including anti-inflammatory components acting in synergy&#xD;
      with miRNA to exert the full effect of the signaling cascade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives The overall objective of this study is to uncover and utilize the mechanisms&#xD;
      behind the activation of endogenous organ protection by remote ischemic conditioning (RIC),&#xD;
      high intensity traditional resistance training (TRT) and low intensity blood flow restricted&#xD;
      resistance exercise (BFRE) with the perspective of defining their applicability for immediate&#xD;
      organ protection in ischemia-reperfusion injury (acute conditioning) and subsequent tissue&#xD;
      repair (chronic conditioning) during a prolonged recovery period. This objective will be&#xD;
      achieved by studying which and how molecular pathways underlying these protective mechanisms&#xD;
      are shared and can be transferred to treat medical conditions. A specific focus is the roles&#xD;
      of EVs and miRNAs. Another objective is to explore how exercise training with and without&#xD;
      ischemia can counteract muscle wasting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall hypothesis of the proposal is that RIC and exercise potentiated by BFRE and TRT&#xD;
      release circulating protective mediators that exert immediate protective effects against IR&#xD;
      injury as well as promote beneficial repair during subsequent tissue rebuilding and in&#xD;
      chronic inflammatory conditions. Specifically, we will test the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. RIC, BFRE and TRT share organ protecting and anti-inflammatory properties induced&#xD;
           through common miRNA signaling pathways&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Long lasting effect of RIC, BFRE and TRT can be achieved by repeated treatment, and the&#xD;
           chronic effects include anti-inflammatory and anti-ischemic properties of clinical&#xD;
           relevance by:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Improving ventricular function and reduce symptoms in patients with heart failure&#xD;
                and chronic ischemic heart disease (individual sub-study, a separate application&#xD;
                has been submitted to and approved by De Videnskabsetiske Komitéer).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Counteracting muscle wasting in patients with heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. BFRE is a more effective mean to increase muscle mass, muscle power and muscle function&#xD;
           compared to TRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Non-conditioned EVs can be loaded with RIC, BFRE and specific miRNA, in vitro and exert&#xD;
           immediate protective effects against IR injury upon intravenous injection (future&#xD;
           sub-study)&#xD;
