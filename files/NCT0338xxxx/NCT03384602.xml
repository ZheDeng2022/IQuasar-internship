      Among the most promising interventions targeting both cognitive and functional decline, is&#xD;
      Exercise. However, evidence regarding exercise interventions among seniors with cognitive&#xD;
      impairment are inconclusive, likely due to challenges of recruitment and adherence.&#xD;
      Alternatively, seniors with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), who are not yet meeting&#xD;
      objective criteria of cognitive impairment, but have been shown to have twice the conversion&#xD;
      rate to dementia compared with healthy seniors, are more likely to be motivated to&#xD;
      participate and adhere to exercise interventions. Thus, exercise interventions in seniors&#xD;
      with SCD may provide a window of opportunity for early prevention of dementia and falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to test the effect of a group exercise (multi-task Jaques-Dalcroze&#xD;
      Eurhythmics) and a simple home strength exercise program on change of cognitive function and&#xD;
      the rate of falling among seniors with SCD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Europe and in Switzerland, the number of seniors age 70 and older is predicted to increase&#xD;
      from 25% to 40% by 2030, as is the number of seniors with cognitive impairments, physical&#xD;
      frailty and resulting consequences, such as falls and loss of autonomy. One out of three&#xD;
      seniors age 65 and one out of two seniors age 80 experience at least one fall per year.&#xD;
      Prevalence of dementia increases with age and more than doubles a seniors' risk of falling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the most promising interventions targeting both cognitive and functional decline, is&#xD;
      Exercise. However, evidence regarding exercise interventions among seniors with cognitive&#xD;
      impairment are inconclusive, likely due to challenges of recruitment and adherence.&#xD;
      Alternatively, seniors with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), who are not yet meeting&#xD;
      objective criteria of cognitive impairment, but have been shown to have twice the conversion&#xD;
      rate to dementia compared with healthy seniors, are more likely to be motivated to&#xD;

&#xD;
      The investigators aim to test the effect of a group exercise (multi-task Jaques-Dalcroze&#xD;
      Eurhythmics) and a simple home strength exercise program on change of cognitive function and&#xD;
      the rate of falling among seniors with SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MOVE for your MIND trial will be a single center, single-blinded randomized controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial among 195 senior men and women and a 12 month follow-up. Participants will be&#xD;
      community-dwelling seniors, age 70+ who meet the criteria for SCD without evidence for&#xD;
      objective cognitive impairment. The 3 treatment arms are: (1) Jaques-Dalcroze Eurhythmics&#xD;
      group exercise (1x60min/week), (2) simple home exercise strength program (3x30min/week), (3)&#xD;
      control group without exercise intervention. All participants will receive a monthly &quot;Healthy&#xD;
      Nutrition&quot; lecture. The hypothesis is that both exercise groups are superior to control.&#xD;
      Under these assumptions, and a sample size of 195 seniors, the investigators will have &gt;90%&#xD;
      power for change in cognitive function and &gt;80% power for the difference in the rate of&#xD;
      falls. Clinical visits will be at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Therapeutic&#xD;
      interventions for seniors with early subjective signs of cognitive decline that are&#xD;
      effective, affordable, and well-tolerated in the prevention of both, cognitive and physical&#xD;
      function decline, are urgently needed and will have an outstanding impact on public health as&#xD;
      a whole. To the investigator's knowledge, this is the first exercise trial to target seniors&#xD;
      with SCD and with the change in cognitive function and the rate of falls as the primary&#xD;
      endpoints. Providing an evidence-base for a group- and a home-based exercise will give a&#xD;
      choice to patients. Further, the mechanistic biomarker study for brain and muscle health&#xD;
      among seniors with SCD will support the findings at the cellular level and whole-brain MRI&#xD;
      imaging will support them at a structural level.&#xD;
