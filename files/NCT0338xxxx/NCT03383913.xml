  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the hypothesis that Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback (HRV-B) restores&#xD;
      autonomic balance and reduces pain and other symptoms among patients with sickle cell disease&#xD;
      (SCD).The specific aims of this study are to: (1) conduct a randomized, wait list controlled,&#xD;
      pilot intervention trial to determine whether HRV-B increases HRV coherence among SCD&#xD;
      participants (minimum N of 30, up to 50 total); (2) determine whether HRV-B reduces pain,&#xD;
      stress, fatigue, depression or insomnia among SCD participants; and (3) determine whether&#xD;
      increases in HRV coherence are associated improvements in pain, stress, fatigue, depression,&#xD;
      or sleep among study participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The purpose of this study is to see if Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback (HRV-B) can reduce&#xD;
      chronic pain, stress, depression, anxiety, insomnia, loneliness, helplessness, physical&#xD;
      limitations and pain medication dependence. HRV-B is an interactive procedure in which&#xD;
      participants relax and breathe regularly while watching a computer screen. The computer&#xD;
      screen provides feedback that helps people increase their heart rate variability, which is&#xD;
      the difference from beat to beat. HRV-B is a complementary, non-pharmacologic therapy that is&#xD;
      now being used to see if it can help sickle cell patients reduce their symptoms of pain,&#xD;
      stress, insomnia, fatigue, or depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to either an Intervention Group or a Comparison Group.&#xD;
      Each group will have about 15-20 participants. The Intervention group will receive a baseline&#xD;
      assessment including symptom questionnaires, up to six weekly HRV-B training sessions lasting&#xD;
      about 45 minutes each, and a follow-up assessment including symptom questionnaires. There are&#xD;
      6-8 total visits for the intervention group and 2 for the control group. The Comparison Group&#xD;
      will have a baseline assessment including symptom questionnaires, then six weeks with no&#xD;
      training sessions, then a follow up assessment including symptom questionnaires. After the&#xD;
      follow up assessment, the Comparison Group members will have the option of receiving the same&#xD;
      treatment as the Intervention Group.&#xD;

    <description>A comprehensive survey of physical function, anxiety, sleep disturbance, depression, fatigue, social roles, pain interference, and pain intensity are completed before the study begins and upon completion. Each domain is measured with a separate short form consisting of eight questions, with the exception of pain intensity, which is measured as a raw score of zero to ten. The scores of these surveys are combined. This number is then converted to a single PROMIS measure T score metric.</description>

    <description>The intervention arm baseline visit will include: Institutional Review Board (IRB) consent, PROMIS measure baseline and outcome assessments, instructions on placement of Firstbeat device and use of Firsbeat journal, resting HRV recording using Firsbeat software for 15 minutes, saliva collection, and distribution of actigraph watch to quantify sleep quality. Participants placed in the intervention arm will receive 4-6 weeks of Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback training. All measures will be repeated at the end of the six week period.</description>

The control group will receive their usual care for SCD and complete baseline and post-baseline outcome assessments without any HRV-B training. All measures will be repeated at the end of the six week period.</description>
