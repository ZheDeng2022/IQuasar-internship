  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine wether pirfenidone is safe and effective in the&#xD;
      treatment of pulmonary fibrosis with anti-myeloperoxydase (MPO) antibodies or pulmonary&#xD;
      fibrosis with anti-MPO associated vasculitis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary fibrosis can be associated with Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody (ANCA)&#xD;
      directed against MPO or with anti-MPO associated vasculitis, leading to increased disability&#xD;
      and poor prognosis. The pathophysiology of this association remains unclear. Conventional&#xD;
      therapies used for the treatment of vasculitis manifestations are often disappointing for the&#xD;
      treatment of pulmonary fibrosis. The main cause of death in patients with anti-MPO ANCA&#xD;
      associated vasculitis and associated pulmonary fibrosis is the progression of pulmonary&#xD;
      fibrosis. No treatment has demonstrated efficacy to stabilize or improve pulmonary fibrosis&#xD;
      associated with anti-MPO associated vasculitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies showed that Pirfenidone improves survival and pulmonary function in patients&#xD;
      with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and that Pirfenidone treatment is safe and well&#xD;
      tolerated in IPF. Patients with anti-MPO associated vasculitis (or anti-MPO antibodies&#xD;
      without vasculitis) and associated pulmonary fibrosis might benefit from the use of&#xD;
      Pirfenidone. However, the efficacy and safety of pirfenidone in patients with anti-MPO&#xD;
      associated vasculitis and associated pulmonary fibrosis has not been evaluated. This study&#xD;
      was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of pirfenidone in patients with pulmonary&#xD;
      fibrosis and anti-MPO ANCA associated vasculitis or anti-MPO antibodies without vasculitis.&#xD;
