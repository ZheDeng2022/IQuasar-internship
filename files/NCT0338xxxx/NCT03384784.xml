    <textblock>
      This study tests whether galantamine (GAL) reduces HIV-related inflammation and cognitive&#xD;
      deficits. In this double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study, HIV-infected individuals&#xD;
      (N=120; 60 smokers and 60 non-smokers) will be randomized to 12 weeks of GAL or placebo,&#xD;
      followed by a 4-week washout, then 12 weeks of GAL or placebo (arms switched). Outcomes are&#xD;
      monocyte/macrophage and T cell activation and neurocognitive performance.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although anti-retroviral therapy (ART) enhances life expectancy and overall quality of life&#xD;
      (QoL), HIV-infected individuals are increasingly vulnerable to non-AIDS-related diseases&#xD;
      including HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Inflammation is a primary mechanism&#xD;
      in the pathogenesis of HAND and tobacco use may further exacerbate inflammation. Conversely,&#xD;
      nicotine alone has anti-inflammatory effects suggesting that stimulating the cholinergic&#xD;
      pathway via pharmacological treatment [e.g., galantamine (GAL)] may suppress inflammation and&#xD;
      reverse or prevent neurocognitive deficits in HIV-1 infection. In this double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled crossover study, HIV-infected individuals (N=120; 60 smokers, 60&#xD;
      nonsmokers) will be randomized to 12 weeks of GAL or placebo, followed by a 4-week washout,&#xD;
      then 12 weeks of GAL or placebo (arms switched). All subjects will be stable on ART and the&#xD;
      GAL dose will follow FDA guidelines. At the beginning and end of each treatment phase,&#xD;
      inflammatory biomarkers and viral load will be assessed. Monocyte transcriptomics will also&#xD;
      be assessed on a subset of the sample (n=60; 30/group). Neurocognition and clinical outcomes&#xD;
      (e.g., QoL) will be measured at baseline and at 4-week intervals during each treatment phase.&#xD;
      The primary outcomes are monocyte/macrophage and T-cell activation (CD16, CD163, and CC&#xD;
      chemokine receptor type 2 or CCR2 expression; plasma CC chemokine ligand type 2 or CCL2&#xD;
      [MCP-1 or monocyte chemoattractant protein-1], sCD14; CD38/HLA-DR [cluster of differentiation&#xD;
      38/Human Leukocyte Antigen- antigen D Related] on CD8 [cluster of differentiation 8] cells)&#xD;
      and neurocognitive performance (processing speed, verbal learning/memory, executive&#xD;
      function). Exploratory outcomes include monocyte gene expression patterns and broad plasma&#xD;
      cytokine analysis. This study will provide insight into the interactions among nAChR&#xD;
      activation, HIV immune activation and pathogenesis, and tobacco use and has translational and&#xD;
      therapeutic implications that could improve health outcomes among HIV-infected individuals.&#xD;

    <description>Cognitive function will be assessed 8 times throughout study participation at Lab Visits and Mid-treatment Visits. Participants will complete measures of executive function, verbal learning and memory and response inhibition. The primary outcome is the change from baseline cognitive function after 12 weeks of treatment.

    <description>This study follows the FDA-recommended dosing regimen for galantamine extended release (GAL ER): 4 weeks at 8 mg (once a day), 4 weeks at 16 mg (once a day), and 4 weeks at 24 mg (once a day).&#xD;
The University of Pennsylvania Investigational Drug Service (IDS) will oversee the randomization of all study medication, purchase study medication, manufacture matched placebo, encapsulate and package them in blister packs to maintain double-blind procedures.</description>

Placebo ingredients will be purchased, encapsulated, and packaged into blister packs by the IDS at the University of Pennsylvania. Both active medication and placebo will look identical.&#xD;
The study medication assignments for each participant in this project is randomized and counterbalanced. This means that approximately 50% of participants will take galantamine during the first medication period, followed by the placebo in the second medication period. Alternatively, approximately 50% of participants will take the placebo during the first medication period, followed by galantamine during the second medication period.</description>
