    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of memory-enriched T cells in&#xD;
      treating patients with grade II-IV glioma that has come back (recurrent) or does not respond&#xD;
      to treatment (refractory). Memory enriched T cells such as HER2(EQ)BBζ/CD19t+ T cells may&#xD;
      enter and express its genes in immune cells. Immune cells can be engineered to kill glioma&#xD;
      cells in the laboratory by inserting a piece of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) into the immune&#xD;
      cells that allows them to recognize glioma cells. A vector called lentivirus is used to carry&#xD;
      the piece of DNA into the immune cell. It is not known whether these immune cells will kill&#xD;
      glioma tumor cells when given to patients.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the feasibility and safety of cellular immunotherapy utilizing ex vivo expanded&#xD;
      autologous memory-enriched T cells that are genetically modified using a self-inactivating&#xD;
      (SIN) lentiviral vector to express a HER2-specific, hinge-optimized, 41BB-costimulatory&#xD;
      chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), as well as a truncated human CD19 (HER2[EQ]BBzeta/CD19t+)&#xD;
      for participants with recurrent/refractory malignant glioma in one of the following ways: Arm&#xD;
      1 (intracavitary/intratumoral HER2(EQ)BBzeta/CD19+ T CM), Arm 2 (dual delivery [both&#xD;
      intracavitary/intratumoral and intraventricular] of HER2(EQ)BBzeta/CD19+ T CM), or Arm 3&#xD;
      (dual delivery [both intracavitary/intratumoral and intraventricular] of HER2(EQ)BBzeta/CD19+&#xD;
      T N/MEM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine maximum tolerated dose schedule (MTD) and a recommended Phase II dosing plan&#xD;
      (RP2D) for arm 3 (dual delivery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe persistence and expansion of CAR T cells in tumor cyst fluid, peripheral blood&#xD;
      and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe cytokine levels (tumor cyst fluid, peripheral blood, and CSF) over the study&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. In research participants who receive the full schedule of 3 CAR T cell doses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIIa. To estimate median progression free survival (PFS) rate. IIIb. To estimate disease&#xD;
      response rates. IIIc. To estimate median overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. In research participants who continue to receive infusions after progressing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IVa. Estimate disease response. IVb. Describe CAR T cell and endogenous immune populations,&#xD;
      as well as cytokine and microenvironment profiles (cerebral spinal fluid [CSF], cyst fluid,&#xD;
      peripheral blood) considering post progression therapy(ies), if applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. For study participants who undergo an additional biopsy/resection or autopsy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Va. Evaluate CAR T cell persistence in the tumor micro-environment and the location of the&#xD;
      CAR T cells with respect to the injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vb. Evaluate HER2 antigen expression levels pre and post CAR T cell therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of autologous HER2(EQ)BBζ/CD19t+ T cells.&#xD;
      Participants are assigned to 1 of 3 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive autologous HER2(EQ)BBzeta/CD19t+ Tcm cells via&#xD;
      intratumoral/intracavitary catheter over 5 minutes weekly for 3 weeks. Beginning as early as&#xD;
      1 week later, patients may receive additional T cell infusions as long as patients remain&#xD;
      eligible and there is product available. Patients who progress on intracavitary or&#xD;
      intratumoral administration may move to alternative delivery routes for the optional&#xD;
      infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive autologous HER2(EQ)BBzeta/CD19t+ Tcm cells via&#xD;
      intratumoral/intracavitary catheter and intraventricular catheter over 5 minutes weekly for 3&#xD;
      weeks. Beginning as early as 1 week later, patients may receive additional T cell infusions&#xD;
      as long as patients continue to remain eligible and there is product available. Based on&#xD;
      clinical response after the first 3 infusions, the study principal investigator may decide to&#xD;
      continue with the optional infusions at either one or both sites (instead of requiring&#xD;
      injections at both sites).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM III: Patients receive autologous HER2(EQ)BBzeta/CD19t+ Tn/mem cells via&#xD;
      intratumoral/intracavitary catheter and intraventricular catheter over 5 minutes weekly for 3&#xD;
      weeks. Beginning as early as 1 week later, patients may receive additional T cell infusions&#xD;
      as long as patients continue to remain eligible and there is product available. Based on&#xD;
      clinical response after the first 3 infusions, the study principal investigator may decide to&#xD;
      continue with the optional infusions at either one or both sites (instead of requiring&#xD;
      injections at both sites).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks, 3, 6, 8, 10, and 12&#xD;
      months, then annually for at least 15 years.&#xD;
