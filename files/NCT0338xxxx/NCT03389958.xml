    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter observational study of implementation of postpartum contraceptive&#xD;
      counseling and provision into the maternity care setting in Colombia, South America. The&#xD;
      primary aim is to determine proportion of uptake of highly-effective contraceptive use after&#xD;
      these methods become available immediately postpartum. Secondary aims include rapid repeat&#xD;
      pregnancy rates, use of other types of contraception, breastfeeding continuation, and&#xD;
      visualization of IUD strings after immediate postpartum placement.&#xD;

      This pre- post-intervention study will take place in Colombia, South America in 2 cities:&#xD;
      Medellin (2 sites and Cartagena 1 site). The main objective is to determine the proportion of&#xD;
      contraceptive usage by women who have just had a baby, before and after the introduction of&#xD;
      specialized contraceptive counseling into maternity care and availability of the most&#xD;
      effective contraceptive methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 (Standard of care) participants will be asked about intention for contraception usage&#xD;
      upon hospital discharge after maternity care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 (Intervention) participants will receive standardized contraceptive counseling and&#xD;
      immediate access to the method of choice, including long acting reversible contraception&#xD;
      (LARC) and other locally available methods. LARC methods available in Colombia include the&#xD;
      copper-T intrauterine device (IUD) and Jadelle® implant, both of which are safe for usage in&#xD;
      postpartum women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will undergo follow- up via phone at 6-8 weeks, and 6 and 12 months postpartum to&#xD;
      determine contraceptive continuation, repeat pregnancy, and to track any complications with&#xD;
      the usage of LARC, including infection and contraceptive failure. For subjects with an IUD,&#xD;
      an additional visit would take place at 8-10 days to determine need for IUD string trimming&#xD;
      and visualization of strings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will include introduction of specialized standardized contraceptive&#xD;
      counseling to occur during inpatient maternity care and immediate postpartum availability of&#xD;
      LARC methods. Currently, contraceptive counseling is left to the postpartum primary care&#xD;
      setting and obstetric providers are not trained for immediate IUD placement. LARC devices are&#xD;
      not typically available in the inpatient setting. Providers and staff of all levels will be&#xD;
      trained in standardized contraceptive counseling methods. Obstetric providers will be trained&#xD;
      in immediate postplacental IUD insertion. Staff nurses and providers will have access to&#xD;
      company-sponsored implant insertion training programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion of participants using LARC methods after implementation of the intervention&#xD;
      will be compared to the proportion choosing LARC prior to the intervention. Additionally, the&#xD;
      outcomes of women choosing non-LARC methods will be compared to those choosing LARC methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has received funding by the Colombian grant agency, Colciencias. Regulatory&#xD;
      oversight has previously been granted by the University of Antioquia's (Medellin, Colombia)&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board. Research operations are managed by the local Colombian&#xD;
      organization, NACER, with support of research design and methods, statistical analysis, and&#xD;
      medical expertise and trainings provided by clinicians from OHSU. Day to day research&#xD;
      operations will be managed by research coordinators at each of the three maternity care&#xD;
      hospital sites with support and monitoring by NACER and by OHSU clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of OHSU clinicians will be to provide research infrastructure and clinical support&#xD;
      via remote communications, to provide initial training of trainers, to provide monitoring of&#xD;
      recruitment and counseling methods, to help in the creation and monitor quality of data&#xD;
      collection forms, and to perform statistical analyses. OHSU will not participate in&#xD;
      recruitment of participants or in clinical procedures. We do not plan to be present at any&#xD;
      research sites in person, though may perform monitoring visits if funds are available.&#xD;
