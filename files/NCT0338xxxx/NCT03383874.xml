  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of adjunctive&#xD;
      probiotic therapy in 66 persons hospitalized with a manic or mixed episode. The active study&#xD;
      compound will consist of capsules containing approximately 10^9 colony forming units of the&#xD;
      probiotic organisms, Lactobacillus GG and Bifidobacteria lactis strain Bb12. The dose has&#xD;
      been selected because it has been used safely in other probiotic trials, was well-tolerated&#xD;
      by the participants in two previous trials of individuals with schizophrenia or mania, and&#xD;
      was utilized in the original trial on which this replication is based. This dose is higher&#xD;
      than that available in most commercially-sold health food supplements. Following hospital&#xD;
      discharge, participants will be randomized to receive adjunctive probiotic or placebo for a&#xD;
      24 week period. It is anticipated that of the 66 participants randomized, ~50 (75%) will&#xD;
      complete the full 24 weeks of the study. The primary outcome is relapse, defined as&#xD;
      re-hospitalization (e.g., admission to an inpatient unit) for psychiatric symptoms following&#xD;
      a previous hospital discharge by at least 2 weeks. The occurrence of new mood episodes, the&#xD;
      severity of psychiatric symptoms, and any changes in cognitive test scores over the course of&#xD;
      the study will also be evaluated. Changes in the levels of inflammatory markers as well as&#xD;
      changes in gut microbiota will be evaluated at three time intervals over the course of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary Aim 1. To determine if adjunctive probiotic administration can reduce relapse for&#xD;
      participants first hospitalized for mania. Hypothesis: Participants receiving adjunctive&#xD;
      probiotic microorganisms vs. adjunctive placebo will have a lower rate of relapse as defined&#xD;
      by a re-hospitalization (e.g., admission to an inpatient unit) during the 24 week study&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes. The number of new mood episodes, the severity of psychiatric symptoms,&#xD;
      and changes in cognitive scores over the 24 week study period will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim 1. To study the effect of probiotic therapy in lowering the levels of&#xD;
      inflammatory markers following an acute episode of mania. Hypothesis: Participants receiving&#xD;
      adjunctive probiotic microorganisms vs. adjunctive placebo will have reduced levels of&#xD;
      antibodies to casein, gliadin, and the NMDA receptor, and reduced levels of C-Reactive&#xD;
      protein and the cytokine TNF alpha following 24 weeks of probiotic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim 2. To evaluate changes in the gut microbiota following probiotic&#xD;
      administration. Hypothesis: Probiotic administration will enrich the gut microbiota of&#xD;
      participants with the given microorganisms and these changes may correlate to changes in the&#xD;
      peripheral inflammatory markers being measured.&#xD;

    <description>The product under investigation is a probiotic containing two microorganisms (Lactobacillus rhamnosus, LGG® and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, BB-12®, referred to as LGG® and BB-12®, respectively) and is offered commercially as &quot;Probio-Tec BG-VCap-6.5&quot;. This composition is formulated to contain a minimum of 1 billion (1.0 x 10^9) CFU (Colony Forming Units) per dose (capsule), including equal numbers of the two strains; i.e. 0.5 x 10^9 CFU of each of LGG® and BB-12® at the time of manufacture. The product will be administered orally.</description>
