      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sometimes prostate cancer comes back after a person s prostate is removed. In this case,&#xD;
      radiation is a common treatment. Radiation kills prostate cancer cells. It can be very&#xD;
      effective. It is usually given in short doses almost every day for 6 or 7 weeks. Researchers&#xD;
      want to see if a shorter schedule can be as effective. They want to see if that causes the&#xD;
      same or fewer side effects. Usually, radiation is used to treat the entire area where the&#xD;
      prostate was before surgery. In some patients, an area of tumor can be seen on scans.&#xD;
      Researchers are also trying to see if they can give less dose to the area usually treated&#xD;
      with radiation if the full dose is given to the tumor seen on scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find the shortest radiation schedule that people can tolerate without strong side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People at least 18 years old who have had a prostatectomy and will get radiation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scan that uses a small amount of radiation to make a picture of the body&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scan that uses a magnetic field to make an image of the body&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide documents that confirm their diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have a scan of the abdomen and pelvis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before they start treatment, participants will have another physical exam and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get radiation each day Monday through Friday. Treatment may last 2, 3, or 4&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may provide a tissue sample from a previous procedure for research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will answer questions about their general well-being and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 4-5 weeks after they finish radiation treatment, participants will have a follow-up&#xD;
      visit. They will be examined and give a blood sample. They will have 6 follow-up visits for&#xD;
      the next 2 years.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate cancer that recurs after prostatectomy (rising PSA) with no evidence of metastatic&#xD;
      disease is often treated with radiation to the entire prostate bed to a dose of 66-72 Gy over&#xD;
      6-7 weeks. This treatment can provide PSA control in approximately 75% of patients, but may&#xD;
      have associated genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity due to irradiation of the rectum,&#xD;
      small bowel, and bladder. Imaging of prostate cancer has improved to the extent that&#xD;
      recurrent disease is often identified in the prostate bed or in other pelvic sites. The&#xD;
      current standard is to irradiate the entire prostate bed to the total dose. This trial will&#xD;
      test the tolerability of accelerated treatment designed to yield a similar rate of late&#xD;
      toxicity. In addition, in patients with visible tumor, it will test the feasibility of&#xD;
      delivering a lower dose to the prostate bed and an integrated boost (simultaneous) to the&#xD;
      visible tumor to allow a higher dose to visible tumor than can be delivered with standard&#xD;
      approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) hypofractionation of image guided, focally dose&#xD;
      escalated post-prostatectomy radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PSA recurrence after prostatectomy or indications for adjuvant radiation after&#xD;
           prostatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No evidence of distant metastases of prostate cancer (pelvic lymph nodes are allowed).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase I trial of hypofractionated, focal dose escalation with reduced dose prostate&#xD;
      bed irradiation using image and pathologic guidance. The prostate bed will be treated with&#xD;
      hypofractionated radiation and areas in the prostate bed or pelvis shown to have tumor on&#xD;
      biopsy or with advanced imaging studies will be treated with an integrated boost to visible&#xD;
      tumor. The treatment duration will be decreased sequentially in three Dose Level groups.&#xD;
      Quality of life and functional outcomes such as urine, bowel, and erectile function will be&#xD;
      assessed with questionnaires. A maximum of 48 patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
