      In this three-month interventional clinical trial for the treatment of gingivitis the&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this single-masked, parallel-armed, interventional clinical trial for treatment of&#xD;
      gingivitis the investigators will assess the use of an oscillating-rotating powered&#xD;
      toothbrush in comparison to the use of a manual toothbrush over 12-weeks in the absence of&#xD;
      interproximal hygiene. The primary outcome variable is the change from baseline in the&#xD;
      Modified Gingival Index at 2, 4 and 12-weeks from Baseline. Secondary outcome variables&#xD;
      include change from baseline in bleeding on probing as well as change from baseline in the&#xD;
      Turesky Modification of the Quigley-Hein Plaque index measuring overnight plaque formation.&#xD;
      There will also be an assessment of single use efficacy in reduction of overnight plaque&#xD;
      levels at the baseline visit t&#xD;

    <description>Baseline and 12 weeks post-baseline measures. Proportion of bleeding sites per patient was used as Full mouth BOP Score. The score for each site was either 1 for bleeding and 0 for no bleeding.&#xD;
Following is the full description of each outcome measure reported in the protocol.&#xD;
The Modified Gingival Index3 (MGI) will be measured on six sites - mesio-buccal, buccal, disto-buccal, mesio-lingual, lingual and disto-lingual - of all teeth using a 0-4 scale. Lower score no inflamation and higher severe inflammation.&#xD;
Dental plaque will be evaluated using the Lobene modification4 of the Turesky modification of the Quigley-Hein Plaque Index (PI)5. The score 0 to 5. Lower score means no plaque and higher score increasing plaque.Full-mouth Probing Pocket Depth (PPD) will be measured on the six locations of each tooth (mesial-buccal, buccal, distal-buccal, mesial-lingual, lingual, distal-lingual) using a periodontal probe.</description>

        <type>Primary</type>
        <title>Change in Gingivitis</title>
        <description>Baseline and 12 weeks post-baseline measures. Proportion of bleeding sites per patient was used as Full mouth BOP Score. The score for each site was either 1 for bleeding and 0 for no bleeding.&#xD;
Following is the full description of each outcome measure reported in the protocol.&#xD;
The Modified Gingival Index3 (MGI) will be measured on six sites - mesio-buccal, buccal, disto-buccal, mesio-lingual, lingual and disto-lingual - of all teeth using a 0-4 scale. Lower score no inflamation and higher severe inflammation.&#xD;
Dental plaque will be evaluated using the Lobene modification4 of the Turesky modification of the Quigley-Hein Plaque Index (PI)5. The score 0 to 5. Lower score means no plaque and higher score increasing plaque.Full-mouth Probing Pocket Depth (PPD) will be measured on the six locations of each tooth (mesial-buccal, buccal, distal-buccal, mesial-lingual, lingual, distal-lingual) using a periodontal probe.</description>
        <time_frame>12 weeks post-baseline</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis was on the number sites per patients. For BOP the score was for proportion of the bleeding sites. Similarly for MGI the score was full mouth average.</population>

            <description>Subjects will be provided an oscillating rotating powered toothbrush as the experimental intervention, and given written and professional oral instructions on its proper use at baseline 2 and 4 weeks. Efficacy of overnight plaque reduction will be assessed at baseline and both gingivitis and plaque reduction will be assessed as change from baseline at 2, 4 and 12 weeks. Subjects will be given a standard fluoride toothpaste and asked to refrain from daily interproximal plaque control for the duration of the study.&#xD;
