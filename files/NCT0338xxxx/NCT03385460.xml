      We hypothesize that LESWs might temporarily increase urothelial permeability and facilitate&#xD;
      delivery of intravesical botulinum toxin without the need for injection.&#xD;

      High energy extracorporeal shock wave thrapy has been used to disintegrate urolithiasis for&#xD;
      30 years (Chaussy et al., 1982). Low energy shock wave LESWs are used clinically to improve&#xD;
      tissue regeneration at tendon- bone junctions (Wang et al., 2003) , ischemic cardiovascular&#xD;
      disorders (Dimeglio et al., 2012) and erectile dysfunctions (Vardi et al., 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, shock waves have been shown to temporarily increase tissue permeability (Lauer&#xD;
      et al., 1997, Kodama et al., 2002) and increase mediated molecular and drug delivery into&#xD;
      cells without consequent cytotoxicity. Kodama et al., 2002 suggested that shock waves could&#xD;
      cause shear force generated by the movement of liquid relative to cells to temporarily affect&#xD;
      the permeability of the plasma memberance. Shock waves can deliver molecules to 2,000,000&#xD;
      molecular weight into the cystoplasm of cells without toxicity (Lauer et al., 1997).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instillation of drugs in the bladder provides the opportunity to locally increase drug&#xD;
      concentration with a low risk of systemic side effects (Kuo et al., 2010, Hsu et al., 2013).&#xD;
      Intravesical pharmacotherapy has been used to treat refractory overactive bladder and&#xD;
      interstitial cystitis/ painful bladder syndrome (smith et al., 2004; Grannantoni et al.,&#xD;
      2008; Boy et al., 2006). However, drug delivery to bladder tissues by intravesical route is&#xD;
      constrained by urothelial impermeability. The watertight barrier is generally located at the&#xD;
      umbrella cells, which are the superficial layers of bladder epithelium augmented by&#xD;
      glycosaminoglycans and uroplakins (Hsu et al., 2013; Birder et al., 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transient permeabilization of cell membranes accomplished by shock waves can deliver&#xD;
      macromolecular drugs in the bladder without toxicity (Lower et al., 1997; Kodama et al.,&#xD;
      2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chuang et al., (2016) demonstrated that contrast enhanced MRI can detect increased rat&#xD;
      bladder permeability after LESWs. Recently, Towner et al (2015) reported increased urothelial&#xD;
      permeability and contrast leakage on bladder MRI after intravesical promtamine sulfate&#xD;
      instillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chen et al., (2014) found that LESWs treatment 3 and 24 hours after cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      administration could attenuate cyclophosphamide induced acute cystitis in rats by decreasing&#xD;
      inflammation and oxidative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent study, Chuang et al., (2016) investigated the feasibiblity of using LESWs for&#xD;
      intravesical botulinum toxin A delivery. They evaluated the efficacy for acetic acid included&#xD;
      bladder hyperactivity in rats. They concluded that LESWs increased urothelial permeability,&#xD;
      facilitate intravesical botulinum toxin A delivery and block acetic acid included hyperactive&#xD;
      bladder. These results support LESWs as a promising method to deliver botulinum toxin A&#xD;
      without the need for injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overactive bladder (OAB) is a condition characterized by presence of urinary urgency, usually&#xD;
      accompanied by frequency and nocturia, with or without urgency urinary incontinence [UUI], in&#xD;
      the absence of urinary tract infection (UTI) or other obvious pathology (Haylen BT et al&#xD;
      2010). OAB is a common problem that impair the quality of life (QOL).The prevalence of OAB&#xD;
      ranged from 11.8% in a population-based survey conducted across five European countries (&#xD;
      Irwin DE et al, 2008 ) to 16.9% according to Epidemiological studies from North America and&#xD;
      the prevalence increases with age rising to 30.9% in those over the age of 65 years.( Stewart&#xD;
      WF et al 2001) Treatment goals are to reduce the occurrence of bothersome symptoms, and&#xD;
      provide beneﬁts that are perceived by patients as meaningful (Brubaker L et al, 2006).&#xD;
      Several treatment options are available for OAB including bladder and behavioral training ,&#xD;
      pharmacologic treatment , and surgical therapies (Wein AJ et al, 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antimuscarinics are well established as pharmacotherapy for reducing OAB symptoms and&#xD;
      improving QOL (Andersson KE et al, 2009). However, their use is limited in some patients by&#xD;
      insufficient response to treatment &quot;refractory OAB&quot;, or intolerable side effects such as dry&#xD;
      mouth ,blurred vision, constipation, and cognitive impairment (Benner JS et al, 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a trial of pharmacotherapy, if the patient has not had an adequate improvement in&#xD;
      symptoms, intra-vesical injection of Botox (BTX) can be offered as the next step. Botulinum&#xD;
      toxin (BTX) is a neurotoxin, it contains a heavy chain that binds to the presynaptic terminal&#xD;
      of the neuromuscular junction , and this then acts by inhibiting the release of acetylcholine&#xD;
      from the presynaptic vesicles at the axon terminal of the motor end plate , that then result&#xD;
      in the muscle that is innervated becoming ﬂaccidly paralyzed. BTX is available in different&#xD;
      preparations, each of which is a distinct chemical entity. The current commercially utilized&#xD;
      type is BTX type A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is cumulative data supporting use of BTX in cases of refractory Deturosr&#xD;
      overactivity. Intradetrusal injection of BTX is followed by a significant improvements in the&#xD;
      number of voiding episodes over 24 h, incontinence episodes, urodynamic variables and&#xD;
      quality-of -life scores (Mangera A et al, 2011). There is a reduction in episodes of urgency&#xD;
      and incontinence by 80% and 60%, respectively. The efficacy peaks at 4 weeks ,with the effect&#xD;
      lasting typically up to 9 months , and repeated treatment efficacy has been shown in up to 10&#xD;
      treatment cycles. Patients should be counseled about the risk of an increased postvoid&#xD;
      residual volume, occurring in 20-40% of individuals, and the need to use&#xD;
      self-catheterization, with the attendant risk of UTI (14-40%) (Mangera A et al, 2011). The&#xD;
      risk of general muscular weakness is considered very rare.&#xD;
