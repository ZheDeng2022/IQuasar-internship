  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ribociclib and everolimus and to&#xD;
      see how well they work in treating patients with malignant brain tumors that have come back&#xD;
      or do not respond to treatment. Ribociclib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking&#xD;
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as everolimus,&#xD;
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by&#xD;
      stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving ribociclib and&#xD;
      everolimus may work better at treating malignant brain tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended phase II dose (RP2D)&#xD;
      of ribociclib and everolimus in children with refractory or recurrent central nervous system&#xD;
      (CNS) tumors. (Phase I) II. To describe the toxicity profile and define the dose-limiting&#xD;
      toxicities (DLTs) of ribociclib and everolimus in children with refractory or recurrent CNS&#xD;
      tumors. (Phase I) III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of ribociclib and everolimus in&#xD;
      children with refractory or recurrent CNS tumors, and the potential for drug-drug&#xD;
      interactions between the two compounds in this population. (Phase I) IV. To characterize&#xD;
      ribociclib concentrations in tumor, and plasma in children with refractory or recurrent CNS&#xD;
      malignancies undergoing neurosurgical procedures. (Surgical Study)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the response rate of relapsed and refractory malignant brain tumors to&#xD;
      ribociclib and everolimus in the context of a phase I study. (Phase I) II. To explore the&#xD;
      effect of ribociclib treatment on Ki-67 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) by comparing archival&#xD;
      and post-treatment tumor tissue. (Surgical Study)&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To increase knowledge of the genomic landscape of treatment-refractory pediatric CNS&#xD;
      tumors, including mechanisms of resistance and response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ribociclib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 of course 1 and&#xD;
      subsequent courses and days 2-21 of course 2, and everolimus PO QD on days 3-28 of course 1&#xD;
      and days 1-28 of subsequent courses. Patients who are undergoing surgery also receive&#xD;
      ribociclib PO QD on days 7-10 before surgery. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 13&#xD;
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable&#xD;
      disease after 13 courses may continue receiving ribociclib and everolimus every 28 days for&#xD;
      up to 13 additional courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.&#xD;

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the highest dose level at which six patients have been treated with at most one patient experiencing a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and the next higher dose level has been determined to be too toxic. Will be estimated using a Rolling-6 phase I design. Only patients who are evaluable for DLT will be consider for estimating of Maximum Tolerated Dose.

      <recruitment_details>This is Phase I and Surgical study for children with retinoblastoma protein 1 (Rb1) positive recurrent or refractory central nervous system tumors. Patients were enrolled at Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium member institutions. The first patient was enrolled on 03/13/2018 and the last patient was enrolled on 11/18/2019. Patients who were enrolled under Surgical study may also be eligible to receive subsequent Phase I defined treatment and evaluable for DLT.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Total 22 eligible patients were enrolled. 16 of them enrolled on the Phase I study and 6 on the surgical cohort. The 'Started' row includes patients who are eligible for the study. One patient in Phase I dose level 1 withdrew prior to protocol therapy and one patient in Surgical study was not eligible for subsequent protocol therapy. The 'Completed' row includes patients who completed all Phase I protocol therapy or who experienced a protocol defined endpoint which took them off therapy.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Defined as the highest dose level at which six patients have been treated with at most one patient experiencing a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and the next higher dose level has been determined to be too toxic. Will be estimated using a Rolling-6 phase I design. Only patients who are evaluable for DLT will be consider for estimating of Maximum Tolerated Dose. Patient who were enrolled under Surgical cohort but received sufficient study defined treatment would also be evaluable for DLT.</description>
        <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
        <population>Patients who were evaluable for dose finding assessment were used to determine the MTD. Evaluable patients are those who were eligible, started treatment and either experienced a dose limiting toxicity during course 1 or received adequate amount of treatment and were followed adequately to be assessed for safety during course 1. Evaluable patients could be from either Phase I stratum or from Surgical stratum as long as they received sufficient protocol defined Phase I treatment.</population>

Of the patients enrolled in Phase I stratum, 11 of them were evaluable for dose finding assessment. Of the patients enrolled in Surgical stratum, 5 of them were evaluable for dose finding assessment. Therefore, we have total 16 patients evaluable for dose finding assessment, 11 from Phase I stratum and 5 from Surgical stratum.</description>
