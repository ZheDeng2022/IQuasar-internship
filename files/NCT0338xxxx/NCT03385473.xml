    <textblock>
      The efficacy and safety of antiretroviral therapy and the damage caused by chronic&#xD;
      inflammation in the presence of the virus has recently lead to the consideration of&#xD;
      initiating antiretroviral therapy earlier than what is required to prevent opportunistic&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there may be subtle differences, all recommended antiretroviral combinations for&#xD;
      first-line therapy are considered equally effective. Nevertheless, treatment success requires&#xD;
      high levels of adherence, which is linked to tolerability and the minimization of adverse&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The genes coding the enzymes that are involved in the antiretroviral clearance pathways and&#xD;
      the transmembrane transport of drugs are known. These genetic variations can determine the&#xD;
      interindividual variations in plasma concentration with the same doses. Both pharmacogenomics&#xD;
      (PG) and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) may contribute to the individualization of therapy&#xD;
      in different chronic conditions through dosing optimization and are associated with a lower&#xD;
      risk of concentration-dependent toxicity and potentially greater efficacy. The use of these&#xD;
      strategies in the context of antiretroviral therapy is in early stage of development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following, our main hypothesis is that PG + TDM dose adjustment of efavirenz or atazanavir in&#xD;
      the initial antiretroviral treatment of naive patients with HIV infection is non-inferior in&#xD;
      terms of efficacy, has improved safety, and shows a better cost/effectiveness profile than&#xD;
      the standard approach with non adjusted doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate our hypothesis we developed this multicenter randomized clinical trial, where&#xD;
      patients from 4 clinical sites in Buenos Aires will be included in the protocol and&#xD;
      randomized to standard of care (SOC) or pharmacological adaptation (PA) -PA: PG + TDM. For&#xD;
      the pharmacogenomics determination, we developed a multiplex approach including main&#xD;
      polymorphisms of CYP2B6, CYP2A6, CYP3A4 y ABCB1 for efavirenz; and UGT1A1, ABCB1 and CYP3A4&#xD;
      for atazanavir. Drug plasma levels will be analyzed with ultra-performance liquid&#xD;
      chromatography (UPLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcomes are to establish the usefulness of PG and TDM in determining the efficacy,&#xD;
      safety and cost/effectiveness of a first-line antiretroviral therapy containing either&#xD;
      efavirenz or atazanavir in patients with HIV infection who have not received prior&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy.&#xD;

      I) General Objectives To establish the overall impact of pharmacogenomic (PG) analysis and&#xD;
      therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) for the selection of the proper dose of efavirenz or&#xD;
      atazanavir in patients with an HIV infection who have not received prior antiretroviral&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II) Specific objectives and working hypothesis Establish the usefulness of PG and TDM in&#xD;
      determining the efficacy, safety and cost/effectiveness of a first-line antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy containing either efavirenz or atazanavir in patients with HIV infection who have not&#xD;
      received prior antiretroviral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II b. Working Hypothesis Pharmacogenomic analysis and therapeutic drug monitoring dose&#xD;
      adjustment of efavirenz or atazanavir in the initial antiretroviral treatment of naive&#xD;
      patients with HIV infection is non-inferior in terms of efficacy, has improved safety, and&#xD;
      shows a better cost/effectiveness profile than the standard approach without dose adjustment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III) Background III a. Introduction Combination antiretroviral therapy has modified the&#xD;
      natural history of HIV infection in an unprecedented manner in medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, the life expectancy of people with a chronic retroviral infection and access to&#xD;
      treatment resembles that of the general population. The efficacy and safety of antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy and the damage caused by chronic inflammation in the presence of the virus has&#xD;
      recently lead to the consideration of initiating antiretroviral therapy earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there may be subtle differences in the effectiveness and speed of viral load&#xD;
      reduction among the currently available drugs, all recommended antiretroviral combinations&#xD;
      for first-line therapy are considered equally effective. Nevertheless, antiretroviral&#xD;
      treatments present difficulties. Beyond the cost, which is covered by national health&#xD;
      programs in most countries that provide medications, treatment success requires high levels&#xD;
      of adherence, which is linked to tolerability and the minimization of adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selecting an adequate drug should not only be restricted to the selection of the components&#xD;
      of the therapy, but it should also include the dosing and administration recommendations for&#xD;
      each drug, aspects that are currently managed in a standard and uniform way that does not&#xD;
      account for the particular characteristics of each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appearing in therapeutics to combat a pandemic, most antiretroviral drugs have been&#xD;
      commercialized with the minimum information required to prove the efficacy and safety of the&#xD;
      drugs. Following, much information is still being gathered in the post-marketing stage. In&#xD;
      addition, the original developmental studies toward the approval of atazanavir were performed&#xD;
      without ritonavir boosting in naive patients with HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The metabolic pathways that participate in antiretroviral clearance are well defined, and the&#xD;
      variations in the genes coding the enzymes that are involved in these pathways and the&#xD;
      trans-membrane transport of drugs are known. Even considering these variations, a clear&#xD;
      dose-response relationship defining reference therapeutic ranges has been established for&#xD;
      many of these drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both pharmacogenomic and therapeutic drug monitoring may contribute to the individualization&#xD;
      of therapy in different chronic conditions through dosing optimization and are associated&#xD;
      with a lower risk of concentration-dependent toxicity and potentially greater efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III b. Applicability In most Latin American countries, approximately two-thirds of the&#xD;
      first-line antiretroviral combinations include two nucleos(t)ides reverse transcriptase&#xD;
      inhibitors and a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, primarily efavirenz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other patients are treated with a protease inhibitor-based regimen that primarily&#xD;
      includes atazanavir or lopinavir boosted with ritonavir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of antiretroviral treatments is high, and the therapeutic objective is to&#xD;
      achieve an undetectable viral load in all patients. However, unpredictable circumstances&#xD;
      related to tolerability and safety could lead to the modification or interruption of a&#xD;
      significant proportion of initial antiretroviral combinations (between 20% and up to 45%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guidance based upon PG and TDM may aid in identifying patients with a higher risk of&#xD;
      intolerance or toxicity and allow both initial dosing and subsequent posology adjustments to&#xD;
      successfully maintain the utility of the drugs and minimize undesired effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III c. Genetic polymorphisms PG is the study of genetic variations related to individual drug&#xD;
      responses. The variability in the expression of transporters, metabolizing enzymes and&#xD;
      receptors is multifactorial but depends primarily on genetic factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are different genetic variants among these hereditary factors, which may involve&#xD;
      extensive portions of the cellular DNA. However the most frequent variations are single&#xD;
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genes that encode transporters, metabolizing enzymes or drug receptors may show different&#xD;
      allelic variants that could impact the expression of the corresponding protein products.The&#xD;
      study of these polymorphisms might predict the behavior of a specific pharmacologic process,&#xD;
      and polymorphisms could be used to characterize patients. For example, patients could be&#xD;
      characterized as slow or ultra-rapid metabolizers with respect to biotransformation enzymes.&#xD;
      Modifying the dose or the dosing interval to obtain a desirable plasma concentration range of&#xD;
      a drug is the major goal of an individualized prescription model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the vast majority of drugs, genotypic analysis of one metabolizing enzyme is not&#xD;
      sufficient to characterize the complete genetic variability of a patient.In the near future,&#xD;
      studies of potential polymorphisms in the genes of transporters and receptors will provide a&#xD;
      better understanding of the pharmacogenomic impact of drug selection in a targeted&#xD;
      therapeutic model. For most therapeutic areas in the meantime, current knowledge allows for a&#xD;
      pharmacogenomic approach focused on the avoiding toxicity of drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV) Hypothesis and general methodology IV a. Introduction Currently available first-line&#xD;
      antiretroviral treatment is usually administered in fixed doses without considering the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic particularities of different adult patients. The possibility of a useful tool&#xD;
      that may help in the identification of these individual characteristics may allow a dosing&#xD;
      adequation that is beneficial from both the safety and the economic perspectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this sense, a combination of PG and TDM may allow a safe reduction in the efavirenz dose&#xD;
      or the administration of atazanavir without booster in selected patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a number of publications regarding the potentially safe dose reduction of efavirenz&#xD;
      and the use of atazanavir without ritonavir boosting in some patients both in case series and&#xD;
      in multi-center cohorts, providing additional support for a prospective clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV b. Variables and tests As primary components of first-line antiretroviral combinations,&#xD;
      therapeutic individualization will be focused on efavirenz and atazanavir. This decision is&#xD;
      based upon two aspects: efavirenz and atazanavir constitute the most frequently used drugs in&#xD;
      conjunction with nucleoside analogs, and in cohort studies, these drugs have been most&#xD;
      clearly identified to be compromised by discontinuations resulting from genetic-related&#xD;
      toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PG for Efavirenz: Polymorphisms of CYP2B6 (rs3745274), CYP2A6 (rs28399433/rs8192726), CYP3A4,&#xD;
      (rs4646437), CYP3A4*1B and ABCB1 (rs1045642). For atazanavir: Polymorphisms of UGT1A1&#xD;
      (rs8175347), ABCB1 (rs10456542),polymorphisms of the steroid and xenobiotic receptor NR1 2&#xD;
      (rs2472677) TDM for Efavirenz (EFV) and Atazanavir (ATV): UPLC with diode arrangement and&#xD;
      mass/mass detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V) Research Design and Methods A randomized prospective clinical study will be performed to&#xD;
      evaluate the field utility of the therapeutic adjustment based on PG and TDM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective population will be naive HIV-positive patients in whom starting antiretroviral&#xD;
      treatment is warranted according to the attending physician's criteria and current&#xD;
      antiretroviral treatment local guidelines, and efavirenz or atazanavir will be included in&#xD;
      the therapeutic combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidates from five centers in Argentina will be invited to participate in this study&#xD;
      through an informed consent process, after which patients will be randomized into one of the&#xD;
      following arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard of Care (SOC): without pharmacological adequation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  With Pharmacological Adequation (PA):based on the PG Index and TDM results Randomization&#xD;
           will be performed using a random number sequence with restricted access with each new&#xD;
           patient incorporation, fulfilling both components of the randomization process (random&#xD;
           assignment and allocation concealment)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included in the study will initiate their antiretroviral combination scheme within 2&#xD;
      weeks of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have a blood sample drawn at randomization visits for PG analysis. For all&#xD;
      patients included in the PA arm, the sample will be processed immediately, with the objective&#xD;
      of obtaining the PG results and the subsequent index within 10 days. As soon as the results&#xD;
      are available, one member of the project team will contact the attending physician to propose&#xD;
      the corresponding dosing adjustment, which should be documented in the patient´s chart. PG&#xD;
      analysis will be performed once for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The samples obtained from the patients in the SOC group will be stored after DNA extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A viral genotyping test before treatment initiation will be performed at the discretion of&#xD;
      the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients included in the PA arm will have a TDM according to this schedule: day +14 (±3),&#xD;
      +28 (±3), and +168 (±3). If there is an abnormal value (out of the therapeutic range), we&#xD;
      will proceed to adjust the prescription according to the following recommendations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 2. Drug dose adjustment according to the TDM results Antiretroviral drug Result Change&#xD;
      in prescription Efavirenz: If above therapeutic range, reduce dose to 200 mg/d Efavirenz: If&#xD;
      below therapeutic range, increase dose to 800 mg mg/d or change prescription to another drug&#xD;
      Atazanavir: If above therapeutic range stop ritonavir or consider changing drug prescription&#xD;
      Atazanavir: If below therapeutic range add ritonavir or consider changing drug prescription&#xD;
      After the modification in dosing, a new TDM determination will be performed within a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All enrolled patients will be followed for one year. The efficacy/safety analysis of the&#xD;
      interventions will be performed after 48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the initial visit and the initiation of antiretroviral treatment, patients will have 3&#xD;
      visits within one year. During each visit, we will perform a physical exam and a medical&#xD;
      interview focusing on adverse events and the quality of life using a questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life will be assessed using a validated questionnaire, FAHI (Functional Assessment&#xD;
      of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Follow up schedule (both arms) Patient follow-up will be performed in accord with the&#xD;
      standard of care for these patients with HIV viral load and CD4+ lymphocyte determinations&#xD;
      every 4 months (±1 month). Because the results of the HIV viral load determination are part&#xD;
      of the efficacy outcome of the study, the extraction/processing fee will be fully covered by&#xD;
      the protocol, similar to the management of the TDM and PG determinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medications Provided that the beginning of treatment and the selection of the therapeutic&#xD;
      plan are chosen by the patient's physician and because the aim of the study is to evaluate&#xD;
      the therapeutic plan, these drugs will be provided by the usual free-of-charge local delivery&#xD;
      system. This project will not incur any additional costs, and is expected to provide economic&#xD;
      savings to the health system.&#xD;
