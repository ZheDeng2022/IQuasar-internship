      This is a single arm, multi-centre, phase II open label study of nivolumab with stereotactic&#xD;
      body radiotherapy (SBRT) for early stage non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SBRT will be delivered in either 3 or 5 fractions. A flat dose of 240 mg nivolumab infusion&#xD;
      will begin after the final fraction of SBRT, within 24 hours and typically on the same day.&#xD;
      Nivolumab will subsequently be given every 2 weeks at a flat dose of 240 mg until 1 year of&#xD;
      total treatment unless any study drug discontinuation criteria are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of toxicities will be performed at each clinic visit during treatment, at 30 days&#xD;
      after the final nivolumab infusion and until 100 days after the final nivolumab infusion.&#xD;
      Changes in spirometry values and PFTs will be assessed throughout the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relapse rates will be assessed with staging CT scans at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months post SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An exploratory assessment will be made of the effect pre-treatment pulmonary function tests&#xD;
      (PFTs) have on outcome measures.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, multi-centre, phase II open label study of nivolumab with stereotactic&#xD;
      body radiotherapy (SBRT) for early stage non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current United Kingdom (UK) guidelines for SBRT do not specify exclusion pulmonary function&#xD;
      criteria. Severely reduced Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) and diffusing capacity&#xD;
      of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) (&lt;40% predicted) are common reasons for medical&#xD;
      inoperability leading to the choice of SBRT. In a large prospective study of patients&#xD;
      undergoing SBRT, poor baseline PFT was not predictive of toxicity including pneumonitis. At&#xD;
      the 2 year follow up, the mean decline in percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in&#xD;
      one second (FEV1) and diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) were only 5.8% and 6.3%&#xD;
      respectively. Focal SBRT is a well-tolerated procedure and acute complications are generally&#xD;
      transient. Symptomatic radiation pneumonitis has been reported at rates of 4-25% of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug induced pneumonitis is reported at 6% in lung cancer patients receiving nivolumab and at&#xD;
      2% with grade 3-4 toxicity. Of note, such rates are similar or lower to other drugs used in&#xD;
      NSCLC including docetaxel for which no PFT restrictions occur. In this study, frequent&#xD;
      assessment of spirometry values may help to predict patients that are developing subclinical&#xD;
      pneumonitis and prompt for early intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SBRT will be delivered in either 3 or 5 fractions. A flat dose of 240 mg nivolumab infusion&#xD;
      will begin after the final fraction of SBRT, within 24 hours and typically on the same day.&#xD;
      Nivolumab will subsequently be given every 2 weeks at a flat dose of 240 mg until 1 year of&#xD;
      total treatment unless any study drug discontinuation criteria are met. The study will&#xD;
      recruit 31 patients. We anticipate it will take approximately 18 months to recruit 31&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include subjects with histologically verified NSCLC deemed by a local&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team (MDT) to have anatomical stage T1-3 [≤5cm] N0 M0 by means of computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) and fludeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) , amenable to&#xD;
      radical treatment with SBRT and inoperable due to medical co-morbidity, being technically&#xD;
      unresectable or patient declining surgery after offer of surgical assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive nivolumab as per the treatment schedule unless any withdrawal criteria&#xD;
      are met. The first nivolumab infusion will be given after the final fraction of SBRT, within&#xD;
      24 hours and generally on the same day. Clinical follow up and investigations are as detailed&#xD;
      in the schedule of assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 5 patients to enroll must have Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group (ECOG)&#xD;
      performance status (PS) &lt; 2 at the time of first dose of investigational medical product&#xD;
      (IMP). An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will meet when the first 5 patients&#xD;
      have reached 3 months follow up from their 1st dose of nivolumab or have withdrawn consent to&#xD;
      follow-up. Patients that have enrolled but did not receive IMP will be replaced. The IDMC, if&#xD;
      satisfied with the safety data from the initial 5 patients, may recommend escalation to&#xD;
      include recruitment of patients with ECOG performance status of 2. Further patients of PS &lt;2&#xD;
      may enroll while awaiting the outcome of the IDMC meeting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IDMC will perform a further safety review when the first 5 patients enrolled with ECOG&#xD;
      performance status 2 have reached 3 months follow up from their final fraction of&#xD;
      radiotherapy or have withdrawn consent to follow-up. Patients that have enrolled but did not&#xD;
      receive IMP will be replaced. Further patients with ECOG performance status 2 will not be&#xD;
      able to enroll unless recommendation is given by the IDMC. In the event that 5 PS 2 patients&#xD;
      have not enrolled by the point that the 15th recruited patient has reached 3 months follow&#xD;
      up, then there will be a further mandated IDMC meeting to assess safety data from the study.&#xD;
      Patients may continue to enroll while awaiting the outcome of this IDMC meeting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of toxicities will be performed at each clinic visit during treatment, at 30 days&#xD;
      after the final nivolumab infusion and until 100 days after the final nivolumab infusion.&#xD;
      Changes in spirometry values and PFTs will be assessed throughout the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relapse rates will be assessed with staging CT scans at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months post SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An exploratory assessment will be made of the effect pre-treatment pulmonary function tests&#xD;
      (PFTs) have on outcome measures.&#xD;
