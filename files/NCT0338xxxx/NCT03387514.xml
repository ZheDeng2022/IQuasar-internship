  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this research is to evaluate response to systemic therapy, including&#xD;
      anti-angiogenesis therapy and/or immune-based therapies via 18F-DCFPyL prostate-specific&#xD;
      membrane antigen (PSMA)-based positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and to compare qualitatively with&#xD;
      conventional imaging response criteria - Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST&#xD;
      1.1) and histopathological endpoints including isolation, enumeration and staining of&#xD;
      Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Response of systemic therapy, including anti-angiogenesis therapy and/or immune-based&#xD;
      therapies will be quantified using PSMA-based PET imaging using a novel agent,18F-DCFPyL, as&#xD;
      a non-invasive imaging biomarker of tumor neovasculature to functionally monitor renal cell&#xD;
      cancer neovasculature in patients undergoing systemic anti-angiogenesis therapy. PSMA PET&#xD;
      will be compared with response to anti-angiogenesis therapy using conventional imaging&#xD;
      computed tomography(CT)-based RECIST1.1 criteria as well as histopathological endpoints&#xD;
      (tumor vascular density, immunohistochemical staining for PSMA and neovascularization&#xD;
      (cluster of differentiation(CD)105, CD31). Whole body PSMA PET/CT scans will be obtained at&#xD;
      baseline, following adjuvant anti- angiogenic therapy and when the patient becomes refractory&#xD;
      to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale and time points for obtaining PET scans is planned with respect to the typical&#xD;
      natural history of metastatic RCC. This project will obtain information from tumors that are&#xD;
      responding to anti-angiogenesis therapy and those resistant to treatment.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-derived uVESSEL models (from primary &amp; metastatic sites) and incorporating patient-derived immune cells, will be tested for response to anti-angiogenic therapies including pazopanib, sunitinib, cabozantinib, and axitinib. Response will be quantified via multiple endpoints, e.g. vessel sprouting, PSMA expression, cell death.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Using the clinical, pathological and imaging endpoints, predictive models will e developed using responses to uVESSEL model above. More specifically the objective response (dichotomous endpoint of yes or no) measured using PSMA-based PET/CT will be used as a dependent variable in a logistic regression model with response to uVESSEL model from above as an independent predictor to segregate uVESSEL responses into two groups corresponding to responders and non-responders to anti-angiogenic therapies.</description>
