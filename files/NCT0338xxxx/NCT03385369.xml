    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. TEAEs are defined as events present at baseline that worsened in intensity after administration of study drug or events absent at baseline that emerged after administration of study drug and up to Day 29.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must meet all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Healthy subjects age 18 to 65 years inclusive at the time of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Written informed consent and any locally required authorization (eg, Health Insurance&#xD;
             Portability and Accountability Act in the USA), obtained from the subject prior to&#xD;
             performing any protocol-related procedures, including screening evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine&#xD;
             pregnancy test at screening and randomization, and must not be lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Females of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a nonsterilized male&#xD;
             partner must use at least one highly effective method of contraception from screening&#xD;
             and must agree to continue using such precautions through to the end of the study. It&#xD;
             is strongly recommended for the male partner of a female subject to also use male&#xD;
             condom plus spermicide throughout this period. Cessation of contraception after this&#xD;
             point should be discussed with a responsible physician. Periodic abstinence, the&#xD;
             rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has a body weight ≥ 50 kg (110 lbs) and a BMI ≥ 23 and ≤ 40 kg/m2 inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Venous access suitable for multiple cannulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Part A only:&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject is a native of Japan or a Japanese American; defined as having both parents&#xD;
             and four grandparents who are Japanese. This includes second and third generation&#xD;
             subjects of Japanese descent whose parents or grandparents are living in a country&#xD;
             other than Japan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Part B only:&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Subject is a native of China or a Chinese American; defined as having both parents and&#xD;
        four grandparents who are Chinese. This includes second and third generation subjects of&#xD;
        Chinese descent whose parents or grandparents are living in a country other than China.&#xD;
&#xD;
