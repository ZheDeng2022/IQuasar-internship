      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the infectivity, safety, and immunogenicity of a&#xD;
      single dose of a recombinant, live-attenuated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine (RSV&#xD;
      6120/∆NS2/1030s) in RSV-seropositive children 12 to 59 months of age and RSV-seronegative&#xD;
      infants and children 6 to 24 months of age.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the infectivity, safety, and immunogenicity of a single dose of a&#xD;
      recombinant, live-attenuated RSV vaccine (RSV 6120/∆NS2/1030s) in RSV-seropositive children&#xD;
      12 to 59 months of age and RSV-seronegative infants and children 6 to 24 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaccine will be evaluated in a stepwise fashion beginning in RSV-seropositive children&#xD;
      (Group 1), and then in RSV-seronegative infants and children (Group 2). In each group,&#xD;
      participants will be randomly assigned to receive a single dose of RSV 6120/∆NS2/1030s&#xD;
      vaccine or placebo at study entry (Day 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled in the study between April 1 and October 31, outside of the RSV&#xD;
      season. Group 1 (RSV-seropositive children) will be followed for 28 days. Group 2&#xD;
      (RSV-seronegative infants and children) will remain on study until they complete the post-RSV&#xD;
      season visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 participants may participate in an optional second season of RSV surveillance during&#xD;
      November to March of the second year following enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits for all participants may include clinical assessments, blood collection, and&#xD;
      nasal washes. Additionally, participants' parents or guardians will be contacted by study&#xD;
      staff at various times during the study to monitor participants' health.&#xD;
