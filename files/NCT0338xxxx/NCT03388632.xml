      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug IL-15 activates the immune system. The drugs nivolumab and ipilimumab unblock immune&#xD;
      cells. The drugs together may allow immune cells to recognize and attack cancer cells,&#xD;
      causing tumors to shrink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the effects and maximum dose of IL-15, nivolumab, and ipilimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older who have cancer that does not respond to treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart, blood, and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scans&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor biopsy: A small needle removes a tumor sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be in 1 of 3 treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IL-15 with nivolumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IL-15 with ipilimumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IL-15 with nivolumab and ipilimumab&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take the drugs in four 6-week cycles. IL-15 is injected under the skin. The&#xD;
      other two drugs are injected into an arm vein over 60-90 minutes. Participants may need to&#xD;
      stay at the hospital 2-3 hours after the first dose of any drug to watch for side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cycle will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weekly blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5 IL-15 injections&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 ipilimumab injection if applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 nivolumab injections if applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scans and a tumor biopsy on day 42&#xD;
&#xD;
      After cycle 4, participants will stop taking IL-15. They will continue the other drugs until&#xD;
      they can no longer tolerate the side effects or their cancer gets worse. Those cycles will&#xD;
      include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests on 3-4 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine tests on 1 day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 ipilimumab injection if applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 nivolumab injections if applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scans every other cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
      After participants stop treatment, their doctor will monitor their side effects for 4 months&#xD;
      or until they go away.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IL-15 is a stimulatory cytokine that activates the immune system, inducing proliferation&#xD;
           of T lymphocytes and NK cells. Administration of recombinant human IL-15 (rhIL-15) has&#xD;
           been shown to result in a dramatic increase of circulating CD8+T cells and NK cells;&#xD;
           these changes in immune cell populations suggest potential for anti-tumor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immune checkpoint inhibitors, including nivolumab (anti-PD-1) and ipilimumab&#xD;
           (anti-CTLA-4), block the engagement of specific T-cell signaling pathways by tumor&#xD;
           cells. These regulatory pathways typically act to downregulate T cell activity and are&#xD;
           co-opted by tumors to allow the malignant cells to evade the immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The combination of rhIL-15 with two checkpoint inhibitor therapies has potential to lead&#xD;
           to enhanced immune activation, resulting in anti-tumor T cell responses that are&#xD;
           effective in refractory cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Determine the safety, toxicity profile, dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated&#xD;
      doses (MTD) of subcutaneous administration of rhIL-15 given in combination with the anti-&#xD;
      CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab and the anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      or treatment-refractory cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the clinical activity of rhIL-15, ipilimumab, and nivolumab combination therapy&#xD;
           as characterized by RECIST 1.1 and immune RECIST (iRECIST) response rate of patients&#xD;
           treated in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigate the biological effects of this combination on circulating T cell subsets and&#xD;
           on PD-1/PD-L1 expression and immune cell activation in tumor tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Patients greater than or equal to 18 years of age with histologically confirmed solid tumor&#xD;
      malignancy that is metastatic or treatment-refractory cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first 4-6 patients enrolling in the study will be placed into lead-in doublets with&#xD;
           a combination of rhIL-15 and either nivolumab OR ipilimumab; once toxicity is cleared in&#xD;
           both doublets (i.e., 2 patients enrolled on each doublet remain free of DLTs for 6&#xD;
           weeks) and a safety analysis is reviewed and approved by the IRB, new patients will be&#xD;
           enrolled directly onto the triple agent combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the first four 42-day cycles on the triplet, patients will receive SC rhIL-15 on&#xD;
           days 1-8 and 22-29, intravenous (IV) nivolumab on days 8, 22, and 36, and IV ipilimumab&#xD;
           on day 8. Cycles 5 and onwards will not include treatment with rhIL-15.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be encouraged to report any and all adverse events, given the high&#xD;
           likelihood of toxicities with the triplet combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood for PD endpoints will be collected throughout the study and tumor biopsies will be&#xD;
           collected pretreatment and on C1D42 (optional during the doublets and triplet escalation&#xD;
           phase, mandatory during the triplet expansion phase)&#xD;

    <description>Ipilimumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody against CTLA-4, a receptor present on the surface of activated T cells that functions as an immune checkpoint. Immune checkpoints pathways typically act to downregulate T cell activity and are co-opted by tumors to allow the malignant cells to evade the immune response. Blocking the engagement of CTLA-4 with ipilimumab allows infiltrating T cells to mount an anti-tumor response. Ipilimumab is approved by the FDA for the treatment of certain patients with melanoma and has shown clinical activity in other tumor types as well.</description>

    <description>Nivolumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against programmed death 1 (PD-1), a receptor present on the surface of activated T cells that functions as an immune checkpoint. One of the ligands for PD-1, PD-L1, is commonly expressed by tumor cells. Similar to inhibition of the CTLA-4 pathway by ipilimumab, blocking of PD-1/PD-L1 signaling by nivolumab allows infiltrating T cells to mount an an immune response against the tumor. Nivolumab is approved as a single agent for several cancer types, as well as for the treatment of advanced melanoma in combination with ipilimumab.</description>

&#xD;
        Subjects may have previously progressed on treatment with one of the 3 agents being used in&#xD;
        this trial or treatment with other checkpoint inhibitors, as long as they have recovered&#xD;
        from previous toxicity. Subjects that previously progressed on treatment with a combination&#xD;
        of any 2 of the 3 agents being used in this trial are eligible for the triplet cohort only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The effects of ipilimumab, nivolumab, and rhIL-15 on the developing human fetus are&#xD;
        unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use&#xD;
        adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to&#xD;
        study entry, during the treatment portion of the study, and for a minimum for 5 months&#xD;
        (women) and 7 months (men) after the last dose of study drug. Should a woman become&#xD;

&#xD;
        Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Willingness to provide blood and biopsy samples for research purposes if on the expansion&#xD;
        phase of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who have received any prior cytotoxic therapy, immunotherapy, major surgery,&#xD;
        antitumor vaccines or monoclonal antibodies in the 4 weeks or 5 halflives, whichever is&#xD;
        shorter, prior to C1D1 (6 weeks prior for checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-CTLA-4 or&#xD;
        anti-PD1/PD-L1 and for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C). Subjects must not have received&#xD;
        radiotherapy in the 2 weeks prior to C1D1. Subjects who had grade greater than or equal to3&#xD;
        irAE during previous treatment with one of the checkpoint inhibitors are excluded from the&#xD;
        trial; subjects who had grade 1 or 2 irAE that have resolved to grade 1 are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with primary brain cancers or active CNS metastases should be excluded from this&#xD;
        clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive&#xD;
        neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse&#xD;
        events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
        composition to any of the agents on this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Concurrent anticancer therapy (including other investigational agents) with the exception&#xD;
        of hormone therapy for breast or prostate cancer. Patients that have received treatment for&#xD;
        a different cancer previously and have been disease-free for less than one year are&#xD;
        excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
        infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
        arrhythmia, cognitive impairment, active substance abuse, or psychiatric illness/social&#xD;
        situations that, in the view of the Investigator, would preclude safe treatment or the&#xD;
        ability to give informed consent and limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inability or refusal to practice effective contraception during therapy or the presence of&#xD;
        pregnancy or active breastfeeding. Because there is no significant preclinical information&#xD;
        regarding the risk to a fetus or newborn infant, pregnant or breastfeeding women will be&#xD;
        excluded from participation in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Documented HIV infection or positive serology, active bacterial infections, serologic or&#xD;
        PCR evidence for active or chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Since rhIL-15 treatment&#xD;
        stimulates the subjects immune system to attack their tumor, the defective immune systems&#xD;
        of subjects with HIV or hepatitis B or hepatitis C makes responses to this treatment much&#xD;
        less likely to provide benefit and these subjects are not eligible for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of severe asthma (subjects with a history of mild asthma that are on or can be&#xD;
        switched to non-corticosteroid&#xD;
&#xD;
        bronchodilator regimens are eligible).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with active autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease that might recur,&#xD;
        which may affect vital organ function or require immune suppressive treatment including&#xD;
        systemic corticosteroids, should be excluded. The use of inhaled corticosteroids is&#xD;
        allowed.&#xD;
