  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this current study is to prospectively enroll consecutive patients&#xD;
      hospitalized with newly diagnosed severe left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF ≤ 35%) for which&#xD;
      the likely etiology is uncontrolled atrial fibrillation or high burden of ventricular ectopy.&#xD;
      Patients completing their established in-hospital treatment plan with rate or rhythm control,&#xD;
      will be discharged with a WCD following informed consent and detailed counseling by&#xD;
      healthcare personnel for a time-period of up to 3 months until reassessment of LVEF and the&#xD;
      need for ICD implantation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TachycardiaInduced Cardiomyopathy (TICMP) refers to impairment in left ventricular function&#xD;
      secondary to chronic tachycardia, which is partially or completely reversible once the&#xD;
      tachyarrhythmia is controlled. Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy has been shown to occur&#xD;
      both in experimental models and in patients with incessant tachyarrhythmia (mostly commonly&#xD;
      uncontrolled atrial fibrillation). Control of ventricular rate or rhythm by means of&#xD;
      cardio-version, negative chronotropic agents, anti-arrhythmic medication and surgical or&#xD;
      catheter-based ablation, resulted in significant improvement of systolic function. However,&#xD;
      until a possible improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), patients with&#xD;
      TICMP with severely depressed systolic function may remain at a high-risk for&#xD;
      life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. While implantable&#xD;
      cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) are indicated in patients who fail to improve their left&#xD;
      ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), currently there is no protection from sudden cardiac&#xD;
      death (SCD) in patients with TICMP during the high-risk time period from hospital discharge&#xD;
      until reassessment of cardiac function and the need for ICD implantation. In this population,&#xD;
      the Life Vest wearable cardioverter defibrillator (WCD) may be an appropriate treatment&#xD;
      option, providing protection from SCD through timely termination of life-threatening&#xD;
      ventricular arrhythmias until stabilization of LVEF. In addition, the monitoring capabilities&#xD;
      of the WCD may facilitate remote assessment heart rate control with appropriate titration of&#xD;
      medical therapy and evaluation of recurrence of tachyarrhythmias following discharge from&#xD;
      hospitalization. Accordingly, the proposed study is the first to prospectively evaluate the&#xD;
      benefit of the WCD as an early management strategy in patients with TICMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no available clinical research data to date on the study device used in TICMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed trial is a multicenter single armed prospective study. Thirty patients with&#xD;
      newly diagnosed severe LV dysfunction due to uncontrolled tachyarrhythmia will be enrolled&#xD;
      following their completion of established in-hospital treatment plan with rate or rhythm&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients will be discharged with a WCD for a time-period of 3 months. All patients&#xD;
      will provide signed informed consent, and detailed counseling by healthcare personnel for a&#xD;
      time-period of up to 3 months until reassessment of LVEF and the need for ICD implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enrollment duration is expected to last 12 months and follow up of additional 12 months&#xD;
      from patient inclusion will be performed. An estimation recruitment rate of 1-2 patients per&#xD;
      month per center is reasonable based on our preliminary data (see section 6.1). Therefore, it&#xD;
      is likely to end up patient's recruitment 10 months following the enrollment phase&#xD;
      initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During follow up, patients will be contacted at (1) end of WCD use (2) 3 month and (3) 12&#xD;
      months post enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total expected duration of study termination is 24 months from the time first patient was&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;

    <description>The LifeVest is a cardioverter defibrillator worn by a patient at risk for sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). It monitors the patient's heart continuously and, if the patient goes into a life-threatening arrhythmia, can deliver a shock treatment to restore the patient's heart to normal rhythm.</description>
