      This is a retrospective cohort study comparing COPD patients aged 40 years and older with new&#xD;
      exposure to roflumilast with up to 5 unexposed (ie, not roflumilast-exposed) COPD controls&#xD;
      matched by propensity score (PS), age, sex, and year of cohort entry. The study is using&#xD;
      electronic healthcare databases in the US (Military Health System database), Germany (GER)&#xD;
      (German Pharmacoepidemiological Research Database), and Sweden (SWE) (national databases&#xD;
      including healthcare, death, and demographics data). The main objective of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the long-term safety of roflumilast in the treatment of COPD with main focus on the&#xD;
      primary outcome of all-cause mortality and evaluation of potential safety issues identified&#xD;
      during the clinical trials of roflumilast. Crude mortality and incidence rates will be&#xD;
      compared between roflumilast exposed and unexposed COPD patients and adjusted hazard ratios&#xD;
      (HRs) of the primary and secondary outcomes will be calculated.&#xD;

      Rationale and background Roflumilast is licensed (i) for maintenance treatment of severe&#xD;
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (FEV1 post-bronchodilator less than 50%&#xD;
      predicted) associated with chronic bronchitis (CB) in adult patients with a history of&#xD;
      frequent exacerbations as add on to bronchodilator treatment (EU) and (ii) as a treatment to&#xD;
      reduce the risk of COPD exacerbations in patients with severe COPD associated with chronic&#xD;
      bronchitis and a history of exacerbations (US). As a condition of approval for marketing in&#xD;
      the EU, the European Medicines Agency requested the Marketing Authorisation Holder to conduct&#xD;
      a long-term comparative observational safety study. Research question and objectives The main&#xD;
      objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety of roflumilast in the treatment&#xD;
      of COPD with main focus on 5-year all-cause mortality and evaluation of potential safety&#xD;
      issues identified during the development programme of roflumilast. Study design Retrospective&#xD;
      cohort study comparing COPD patients aged 40 years and older with new exposure to roflumilast&#xD;
      with up to 5 unexposed (i.e. not roflumilast exposed) COPD controls matched by propensity&#xD;
      score (PS), age, sex, and year of cohort entry. PS matching was used as an established method&#xD;
      to control for confounding. Crude mortality and incidence rates were compared between&#xD;
      roflumilast exposed and unexposed COPD patients and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of the&#xD;
      primary and secondary outcomes were calculated in GER and SWE, while in the US adjusted HRs&#xD;
      were only calculated for the primary outcome and are not yet available for secondary&#xD;
      outcomes. Reported adjusted HRs for secondary outcomes therefore only refer to GER and SWE.&#xD;
      Setting Electronic healthcare databases in the United States (US), Germany (GER), and Sweden&#xD;
      (SWE) holding demographic data, data on health, and dispensing of medication. The initial&#xD;
      assessment of the number of cohorts in each database including the years 2011, 2012, and 2013&#xD;
      resulted in a total of 54985 (9573 exposed), 50493 (8775 exposed), and 18602 (3207 exposed)&#xD;
      COPD patients in the US, GER, and SWE, respectively. Variables and data sources Exposure&#xD;
      variable: Use of roflumilast (ATC code R03DX07) Outcomes: The primary outcome in the study is&#xD;
      5-year all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes are death by suicide or hospitalisation for&#xD;
      suicide attempt, hospitalisation for any cause, major cardiovascular events, respiratory&#xD;
      disease related hospitalisation, new diagnosis of depression, new diagnosis of malignant&#xD;
      neoplasm, hospitalisation due to serious diarrhoea of non-infectious origin, abnormal and&#xD;
      unexplained weight loss, and new diagnosis of tuberculosis or hepatitis B or C or other&#xD;
      severe viral hepatitis infection (except hepatitis A). Other covariates: Characterisation of&#xD;
      baseline therapy, baseline medical history and other socio-demographic covariates. Data&#xD;
      sources: Military Health System database (US), German Pharmacoepidemiological Research&#xD;
      Database (GER), national databases including healthcare, death, and demographics data (SWE).&#xD;
