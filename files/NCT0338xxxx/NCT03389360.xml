  <brief_summary>

      , the study aimed at assessing the frequency of rising procalcitonin associated with&#xD;
      infectious complications in immunosuppressed LDLTRx.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients transferred from operative theatre to ICU will be sedated, intubated &amp;&#xD;
      ventilated. They will receive empiric antimicrobial prophylaxis upon admission &amp; early&#xD;
      immunosuppression according to the clinical practice guidelines in our center, (Appendix 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative patients' demographic data will be obtained. Model for end-stage liver disease&#xD;
      (MELD) prior transplant, the primary cause of liver transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operative &amp; anesthetic details; operation time, units of blood, blood products transfusion,&#xD;
      ischemic time, type of preservatives used, back table procedures, extra-hepatic procedure &amp;&#xD;
      graft to recipient weight ratio will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative patient evaluation will include; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) on&#xD;
      admission &amp; /48h. Hemodynamic monitoring will include hourly measurement of heart rate, mean&#xD;
      arterial pressure (MAP), temperature, central venous pressure (CVP), arterial oxygen&#xD;
      saturation (SaO2), daily total volume of fluid infused, urine output, fluid balance daily,&#xD;
      blood gases / 6h &amp; daily mean values will be recorded till hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine laboratory workup includes biochemical markers of liver, kidney function and&#xD;
      hematological parameters (complete blood count &amp; coagulation profile).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient evaluation for infection will be done through scheduled measurements of PCT every&#xD;
      other day during ICU stay &amp; upon needed during the hospital stay. Other markers of infections&#xD;
      will be measured till hospital discharge as C-reactive protein (CRP) every other day, daily&#xD;
      total leukocyte count (TLC) &amp; band cells %.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiological evidence of infection will be confirmed by cultures that will be regularly&#xD;
      sampled every other day during ICU stay &amp; upon any clinical or laboratory biomarker&#xD;
      suggestive of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of suspected infection; when PCT value rising with clinical, radiological &amp;/or&#xD;
      laboratory evidence of infection (TLC, CRP, band%), culture from suspected site of infection&#xD;
      will be withdrawn. If the source of infection is not evident, cultures from; blood, urine,&#xD;
      sputum, surgical wound, drain &amp; nasal swab will be withdrawn &amp; empiric antimicrobial against&#xD;
      gram +ve bacteria will be initiated. While the management of proven infection will be culture&#xD;
      based antimicrobial initiation.&#xD;
