  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gold markers implanted in the prostate are used frequently for position verification of the&#xD;
      prostate during external-beam radiotherapy. By using the markers as a surrogate for the&#xD;
      prostate itself, not only set-up errors, but also the internal motion of the prostate&#xD;
      relative to the bony anatomy can be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is thus believed that escalated dose marker guided radiotherapy should result in better&#xD;
      biochemical control compared to conventional external beam radiotherapy, with a similar or&#xD;
      lower incidence of toxicity. However, clinical data to support this is still limited. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to directly compare late toxicity as well as biochemical control&#xD;
      between patients treated with dose escalated marker guided radiotherapy versus conventional&#xD;
      dose non-marker guided radiotherapy who has otherwise been treated with similar radiotherapy&#xD;
      planning techniques and equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate magnetic resonance imaging has undergone several technical improvements and shows&#xD;
      promises for prostate tumor detection and localization. In addition to morphological&#xD;
      information, magnetic resonance imaging allows an estimation of physiological properties of&#xD;
      tissues. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging is sensitive to restriction of&#xD;
      diffusion of water molecules, and dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging can&#xD;
      analyze tissue micro vascular properties. Multi para metric magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      combining Diffusion-weighted and Dynamic contrast enhanced has demonstrated its value in&#xD;
      distinguishing malignant from benign prostate tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Higher radiation dose levels were consistently associated with improved biochemical control&#xD;
      outcomes and reduction in distant metastases. Radiation dose was one of the important&#xD;
      predictors of long-term biochemical tumor control. Dose levels &lt; 70.2 Grey and 70.2-79.2 Grey&#xD;
      were associated with 2.3 and 1.3-fold increased risks of pro static specific antigen relapse&#xD;
      compared with higher doses. However, further dose escalation to the whole gland is limited&#xD;
      due to an unacceptable high risk of acute and late toxicity. Moreover, local recurrences&#xD;
      often originate at the location of the macroscopic tumor, so boosting the radiation dose at&#xD;
      the macroscopic tumor within the prostate might increase local control. A reduction of&#xD;
      distant metastases and improved survival can be expected by reducing local failure. Treating&#xD;
      the dominant focus or boosting the dose to this area while reducing the dose to as much&#xD;
      healthy tissue as possible has significant potential for improving treatment.&#xD;

      Thirty consecuative loclized prostate cancer patients will be recruited according to&#xD;
      inclusion &amp; exclusion criteria. Once the patient meets the selection criteria stratification&#xD;
      will be done according to the following risk group classification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage Gleason score PSA Low risk T1-T2a 2-6 &lt; 10 ng/mL Intermediate risk T2b-T2c 7 10-20&#xD;
      ng/mL High risk T3a 8-10 &gt; 20 ng/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will receive 2-6 months of neo adjuvant hormonal treatment, followed with&#xD;
      concomitant hormonal treatment during the radiation course for intermediate and high risk&#xD;
      groups then adjuvant hormonal for 2-3 years in the high risk group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient the radio-opaque marker (used for treatment verification) will be inserted&#xD;
      by ultrasound guidance &amp; local anesthetic with an 17 GA x 30 cm brachy therapy needle that&#xD;
      has 1.2 mm x 3 mm one gold marker. The ultrasound probe (as used for trans rectal biopsy)&#xD;
      will be introduced rectally with the patient in the left lateral position. After measuring&#xD;
      the volume of the prostate and determining the desired position (preferably in the corpus of&#xD;
      prostate), three gold markers will be inserted as follows: one into right side, one into left&#xD;
      side of the base and the third in the apex of the prostate. All patients will receive a&#xD;
      course of preventive antibiotic treatment that consists of ciprofloxacine 500 mg BID, 1 day&#xD;
      before implantation and 4 consecutive days. Patients under anti-platelet therapy will be told&#xD;
      to stop the medication 5 days before implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT images will be done within 5 days of markers insertion in the same treatment supine&#xD;
      position with Knee &amp; ankle support. CT images will be taken in 1.25 mm slice thickness from&#xD;
      the top of the 4th lumbar vertebrae to ischial tuberosities. Patients will be asked to&#xD;
      evacuate bowels prior to scanning, and bladder will be kept comfortably full by drinking two&#xD;
      glasses of water (250-500 ml) 30 min prior to the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reference marks, one mid line and two lateral, will be placed at the level of the upper&#xD;
      border of the symphysis pubis or iliac crest. No contrast will be used so as to avoid the&#xD;
      dose artifact by it during treatment planning and dose calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multi parametric magnetic resonance imaging combing Diffusion-weighted &amp; Dynamic contrast&#xD;
      enhanced with intravenous contrast will be done prior to Marker insertion with the sequence&#xD;
      of: axial T1 &amp; T2, coronal T2 &amp; spare, post contrast dynamic axial &amp; sagittal and diffusion&#xD;
      with ADC. The views of MRI images will be in 1.25 mm thickness with 0 gap. Fusion of both CT&#xD;
      images &amp; MRI images will be done using manual registration guided by bony landmarks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delineation of clinical target volumes &amp; risk organs will be done on CT images guided with&#xD;
      MRI fused images according to Radiation therapy oncology group criteria. MRI T2 weighted&#xD;
      images will guide the pro static delineation from base to apex, with more accurate&#xD;
      identification of the apex compared to CT. Also Diffusion-weighted with Dynamic contrast&#xD;
      enhanced magnetic resonant imaging will be of value for identification of dominant focal&#xD;
      lesion of the prostate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be treated with radical radiotherapy to prostate 78 Gray/35# (2.2 Gray/#)&#xD;
      with simultaneous integrated boost to focal lesion 87.5 Grey/35# (2.5 Gray/#). Lymph node 60&#xD;
      Grey if positively involved. Seminal vesicle will receive 78 Gray if involved &amp; 54 Gray if&#xD;
      not. Roche formula will be used to estimate lymph node &amp; seminal vesicle involvement if more&#xD;
      than 15%:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Seminal vesicle involvement (%) = PSA + [10× (Gleason-6)]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pelvic lymph node involvement = 2/3 × PSA + [10× (Gleason score -6)]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Constrains for organs at risk will be followed according to QUANTEC. Plan acceptance for&#xD;
      Planning target volume of the targets will be done as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  D 95(95% of the prescribed dose) must be received by at least 95% of the planning target&#xD;
           volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  D max (dose received by 2% of the volume) should not exceed 107% and should be inside&#xD;
           the clinical target volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  D min (dose received by 98% of the volume) should not be less than 90% and should be&#xD;
           outside the clinical target volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the standard quality assurance procedures carried out for any radiation&#xD;
      technique, such as dose output calibration, ISO-center and Multi-leaf collimator&#xD;
      verification, V MAT patients will undergo specific pretreatment quality assurance measures to&#xD;
      check ISO-center absolute dose (using ionization chamber and slap phantom) and dose (using&#xD;
      portal image and portal dosimeter module on the planning system).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Position verification will be done guided with implanted gold markers with daily portal&#xD;
      imaging (AP &amp; lateral) correction protocol in mediolateral, superior-inferior &amp;&#xD;
      inward-outward directions. The portal correction images will be verified daily to detect&#xD;
      average shifts in the three directions using 2D-2D match &amp; Marker Match. Random or&#xD;
      inter-fraction errors which are deviations between different fractions will be taken weekly&#xD;
      during a treatment series. Systematic errors Which are deviations between the planned patient&#xD;
      position and the average patient position of a course of fractional therapy will be taken in&#xD;
      the first three settings. The mean and standard deviation (SD) of the systematic error and SD&#xD;
      of random errors will be analyzed. To represent true magnitude of errors, the absolute value&#xD;
      of the deviations will be also considered. These means will be used in calculations of the&#xD;
      off-line treated Dose-Volume Histogram versus Planned Dose-Volume Histogram and in&#xD;
      measurement of systemic &amp; random error to define reasonable planning target volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up of the patients will be done with mean of 12 months to detect biochemical control &amp;&#xD;
      disease free survival. PSA &amp; pelvic ultrasound will be done every 3 months for first 2 years&#xD;
      then every 6 months for 3-5 years. Genito-urinary, gastro-intestinal &amp; hematological toxicity&#xD;
      will be assessed using Radiation Therapy Oncology Group toxicity score &amp; patient reported out&#xD;
      coming will be assessed using questionnaire (validated Arabic translation) every 3 months.&#xD;
