    <textblock>
      This pilot study is an investigation of feasibility of moderate dose omega-3 fatty acid&#xD;
      supplementation in pre-menopausal women at high risk for breast cancer who are considering&#xD;
      future pregnancy. The goal of this pilot study is to determine feasibility of the study,&#xD;
      document compliance with omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in this population and identify&#xD;
      novel biomarkers modulated by moderate dose omega-3 fatty acids in this population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy and breast feeding are protective when they occur at an early age, typically at an&#xD;
      age less than 30. The influence of pregnancy on breast cancer risk is not fully understood,&#xD;
      and little is known about modulation of the breast microenvironment during pregnancy and its&#xD;
      influence on risk. Hormones, including rising estrogen levels, play a role in fatty acid&#xD;
      synthesis. In pre-clinical models, a rise in omega-3:omega-6 ratio occurs naturally in the&#xD;
      breast of pregnant mice. This may be able to be accentuated in human breast tissue with&#xD;
      omega-3 fatty acid supplementation. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation has been shown to&#xD;
      favorably modulate breast cancer risk and risk biomarkers in pre-menopausal women at high&#xD;
      risk for breast. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation during pregnancy has also been found to&#xD;
      have positive outcomes for the offspring, making it an ideal intervention to study in this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study of omega-3 supplementation in pre-menopausal women at high risk for breast&#xD;
      cancer who are still considering pregnancy is addressing a potential prevention strategy in a&#xD;
      population otherwise excluded from breast cancer prevention trials and not eligible for&#xD;
      standard of care chemoprevention. With this pilot, the intent is to establish feasibility,&#xD;
      document tolerability, determine number of women needed to enroll based on pregnancy rate and&#xD;
      identify biomarkers for future investigation. This information will provide necessary data to&#xD;
      apply for future extramural funding for a larger randomized trial. In a larger randomized&#xD;
      trial with longer follow up, we will be able to assess post-pregnancy breast tissue and&#xD;
      biomarkers to examine efficacy of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in breast cancer risk&#xD;
      reduction.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women age 21 - 40 must be pre-menopausal as defined as having intact ovaries with&#xD;
