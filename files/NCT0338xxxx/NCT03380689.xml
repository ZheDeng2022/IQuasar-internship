      Phase I Study of biweekly combination therapy with S-1, Irinotecan, and Bevacizumab as 1-line&#xD;
      Chemotherapy in Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In several clinical studies from Japan and South Korea, the combination regimen of S-1 and&#xD;
      irinotecan has shown efficacy in the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer, and a Phase III&#xD;
      study（TRICOLORE） showed that the combination therapy with S-1/irinotecan/bevacizumab (a&#xD;
      3-week regimen [SIRB] or 4-week regimen [IRIS/bevacizumab]) is not inferior to the&#xD;
      oxaliplatin-based standard treatment (mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab or CapeOX/bevacizumab) in patients&#xD;
      with metastatic colorectal cancer who had not previously received chemotherapy. Here, we&#xD;
      design this phase I study to explore the Chinese population's tolerability and efficacy of&#xD;
      Biweekly SIRB Regimen(S-1/irinotecan/bevacizumab) and to explore the recommended dose of&#xD;
      irinotecan in this regimen.&#xD;

Five escalating dose levels of CPT-11 were prepared, at an initial dose of 75mg/m2/day (level 1), stepping up to 100 (level 2), 125 (level 3), 150 (level 4) or 175 (level 5) mg/m2/day.</description>
