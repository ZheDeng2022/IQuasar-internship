  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical research is to compare new methods of identifying the locations&#xD;
      of tumours to standard CT imaging. Analysis of the tissue removed during surgery (pathology)&#xD;
      will be used to determine which method is more accurate. Accurately identifying the locations&#xD;
      of tumours is especially important for radiation therapy, where the radiation needs to cover&#xD;
      the entire tumour while minimizing the amount normal tissue that is exposed to radiation. The&#xD;
      new method uses optical imaging (endoscopy) that can be mapped to the CT imaging using device&#xD;
      tracking technologies. CT imaging is used to create the radiation treatment plans and so&#xD;
      tumour locations are normally provided by CT images. The advantage of the new technology that&#xD;
      is being tested is that it may be able to locate regions of a tumour that are at the surface&#xD;
      of the tissue. These tumours are difficult to see using CT imaging but easy to see using&#xD;
      optical imaging. Currently, there is no accurate way of mapping the optical imaging to the CT&#xD;
      images used in radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enable the investigators to test the new optical imaging by comparing the&#xD;
      tumour that the investigators identify using CT imaging alone against using CT imaging plus&#xD;
      the optical imaging technology. The results from this imaging will be compared to pathology&#xD;
      findings.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      a CT image that includes a contrast agent that helps to identify the location of the tumour.&#xD;
      Small markers will be placed on the participants head prior to the scan so that the&#xD;
      investigators can align this CT image with the tracking technology used during the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be moved to the surgical table, where the surgery will proceed as it&#xD;
      would for standard of care procedures. The tracking technology and optical imaging will be&#xD;
      used to identify where the tumour is located at the tissue surface&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumour tissue and extra tissue surrounding the tumour will be removed, as would occur&#xD;
           normally in surgery. Some markers may be placed on the tissue where it is cut. These&#xD;
           will be helpful in matching the tissue that is removed with its location in the images.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A second CT image will be taken immediately following the tissue removal. This will be&#xD;
           made using an imaging device called a cone beam CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In collaboration with the pathology department, whole mount tissue samples will be&#xD;
           assessed to determine the location of tumour tissue. Using the markings on the tissue&#xD;
           and images taken of the tissue sample after it has been removed, the location of the&#xD;
           tumour in the tissue sample will be compared to the location of the tumour in the CT&#xD;
           image and the location of the surface tumour determined by the optical imaging&#xD;
           technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The CT images may be analyzed by radiation oncologists, surgeons and physicists.&#xD;
