    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this study is to evoke functional movement in the hand of both healthy&#xD;
      individuals and individuals diagnosed with a stable cervical spinal cord injury with&#xD;
      non-functional movement of the fingers. The primary purpose of this study is to determine the&#xD;
      feasibility of achieving refined hand movements through electrical stimulation of the muscles&#xD;
      within the forearm. It is believed that this study will be able to identify specific&#xD;
      stimulation parameters and electrode spatial configurations responsible for various refined&#xD;
      hand movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After an eligible individual agrees to participate in this study, s/he will receive&#xD;
      transcutaneous electrical stimulation on the forearm in order to evoke different hand and&#xD;
      finger movements. The precision, specificity, and extent of these movements will be visually&#xD;
      assessed. In order to better evaluate these movements, participants may also be asked to&#xD;
      perform various functional tasks with their hand. The grip strength and evoked forces at the&#xD;
      fingertips will also be measured using sensors. There will be up to 4 study sessions each&#xD;
      week for up to 8 weeks, with each session lasting up to 4 hours. Upon completion of these&#xD;
      study sessions, the individual's participation in the study is considered complete.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to evaluate whether electrical stimulation applied to the muscles within the forearm&#xD;
      can evoke functional movement in the hand, participants will receive transcutaneous&#xD;
      electrical stimulation via an investigational (not FDA approved) neuromuscular stimulator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to attend up to 4 study sessions a week for up to 8 weeks, with&#xD;
      each session lasting up to 4 hours. At these sessions, electrical pulses will be sent to the&#xD;
      forearm muscles through electrodes placed on the skin. These electrodes may also be&#xD;
      accompanied with a gel or lotion to allow for a better connection of the electrodes to the&#xD;
      skin. The precision, specificity, and extent of hand and finger movements will be visually&#xD;
      assessed in real time and later reassessed on video recordings of the session. The study will&#xD;
      also involve the placement of sensors on the hand and finger to measure the amount of grip&#xD;
      strength and evoked forces. In order to monitor the health of participants, the study will&#xD;
      assess blood pressure and heart rate before, during, and after the electrical stimulation.&#xD;
      Upon completion of these study sessions, the individual's participation in the study is&#xD;
      considered complete.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study will involve 3-10 eligible healthy volunteers and 2-5 eligible individuals with a stable cervical spinal cord injury. The study will first enroll healthy volunteers into the study in order to determine the feasibility of evoking refined hand movements through electrical stimulation, and determine the electrical stimulation parameters and electrode spatial configurations responsible for various hand movements. After this is done, the study will proceed with the enrollment of individuals with spinal cord injuries. This enrollment process is being done to reduce the participation time required for participants with a spinal cord injury, and thus lower the likelihood of risks that are more prevalent among individuals with a spinal cord injury.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>This outcome measure will be assessed at each study session throughout the 8-week duration of the study.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure will be achievable wrist and finger movements that will be visually assessed for the type and extent of motion in relation to the stimulation parameters and electrode spatial configurations. The extent of wrist, forearm, and individual finger movements will be categorized as either flexion, extension, adduction, abduction, pronation, or supination and graded as no movement, slight movement, moderate movement, or substantial movement.</description>
