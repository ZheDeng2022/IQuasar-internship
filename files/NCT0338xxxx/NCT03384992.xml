  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The FoRtitude trial aims to evaluate an eHealth intervention designed to teach breast cancer&#xD;
      survivors strategies to manage anxiety about cancer recurrence. The eHealth intervention&#xD;
      includes educational content and interactive tools, designed to teach coping strategies&#xD;
      and/or inert content, depending on the study participant's randomization assignment. The&#xD;
      FoRtitude study will examine whether three coping strategies (relaxation training, cognitive&#xD;
      restructuring, worry practice) are more effective than general health-related content in&#xD;
      reducing fear of cancer recurrence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the FoRtitude trial is to develop and evaluate a targeted eHealth intervention&#xD;
      designed to teach breast cancer survivors (BCS) coping strategies to manage fear about cancer&#xD;
      recurrence (FoR). FoRtitude, a web-based program with interactive text messaging&#xD;
      capabilities, was created to deliver a targeted intervention for BCS with moderate to severe&#xD;
      FoR. FoRtitude consists of didactic content presented in written and video-based formats and&#xD;
      interactive tools, designed to teach coping strategies. Commonly used cognitive behavior&#xD;
      therapy (CBT) techniques were tailored to the management of FoR and included diaphragmatic&#xD;
      breathing and relaxation, cognitive restructuring, and scheduled worry practice. Participants&#xD;
      are encouraged to use the FoRtitude site several times per week over a period of 4 weeks. The&#xD;
      investigators employed principles of user-centered design to create the FoRtitude website and&#xD;
      incorporated feedback from 17 BCS to refine site content and improve FoRtitude usability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After refining the FoRtitude site, the investigators will conduct a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial using the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) to individually evaluate three coping&#xD;
      strategies; each coping strategy will be compared to health management content. Inert content&#xD;
      includes general health information and managing comorbid illnesses, information on general&#xD;
      nutrition, and information on nutritional topics of interest to BCS. Half of the participants&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive telecoaching, which included 3-4 telephone-based brief sessions&#xD;
      with a motivational interviewer, aimed at improving adherence to use of the FoRtitude site.&#xD;
      Participants will complete questionnaires at baseline, 4 weeks (immediately after completing&#xD;
      the FoRtitude site) and at 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. BCS randomized to Relaxation training will report a greater reduction in fear of cancer&#xD;
           recurrence from pre-post intervention than BCS randomized to inert (health management)&#xD;
           content&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. BCS randomized to Cognitive restructuring will report a greater reduction in fear of&#xD;
           cancer recurrence from pre-post intervention than BCS randomized to inert (health&#xD;
           management) content&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. BCS randomized to Scheduled Worry practice will report a greater reduction in fear of&#xD;
           cancer recurrence from pre-post intervention than BCS randomized to inert (health&#xD;
           management) content&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. BCS randomized to receive Telecoaching will demonstrate higher adherence to using the&#xD;
           FoRtitude site and will report a greater reduction in fear of cancer recurrence from&#xD;
           pre-post intervention compared to BCS randomized to no Telecoaching&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. BCS randomized to a higher number of coping strategies will report a greater reduction&#xD;
           in fear of cancer recurrence from pre-post intervention than BCS randomized to receive&#xD;
           all inert content or fewer coping strategies (dose-response effect)&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>FoRtitude includes three CSMs: (1) diaphragmatic breathing and relaxation, (2) cognitive restructuring, and (3) scheduled worry practice. The fourth intervention component is (4) telephone coaching. We assigned two levels (yes, no) to each component. Evaluating individual and combined intervention components, each with two levels, results in a classic full factorial design with 16 (2 x 2 x 2 x 2) experimental conditions</intervention_model_description>
