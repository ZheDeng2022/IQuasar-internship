      Early detection of cardiomyopathy in patients receiving Anthracycline chemotherapy and&#xD;
      determine if speckle tracking echo and Troponin gene will add benefit for early detection of&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improve economic impact of oncologic patients from whom high sensitive troponin negative and&#xD;
      normal speckle tracking patients can be safely excluded from long-term cardiac monitoring&#xD;
      programs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Anthracycline chemotherapy has saved the lives of many cancer victims during the 50 years&#xD;
      after their discovery.These patients are prone to higher risk of cardiovascular death than&#xD;
      the risk of tumor recurrence, particularly in childhood cancer survivors in whom the cardiac&#xD;
      mortality rate is seven fold higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac toxicity remains an important side effect of anticancer therapies, leading to&#xD;
      increased mortality due to mainly heart failure, but also arrhythmias, hypertension,&#xD;
      thromboembolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time from early development of cardiac dysfunction to the modification or end of&#xD;
      chemotherapy and beginning of heart failure therapy, is an important determinant of the&#xD;
      extent of recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines may be acute, early or late. A recent study involving&#xD;
      2625 patients (mean follow-up 5 years); showed a 9% overall incidence of Cardiotoxicity after&#xD;
      anthracycline treatment, 98% of cases occurred within the first year and were asymptomatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiotoxicity has been defined using various classifications. Recent guidelines suggest that&#xD;
      Cancer therapeutics-related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD) is defined as a decrease in the LVEF&#xD;
      (by echocardiography) of &gt;10 percentage points to a value below the lower limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiography should be repeated before every next administration of anthracycline, after&#xD;
      3, 6, and 12 months from the end of therapy with anthracycline but...Not all patients treated&#xD;
      with chemotherapy require such frequently repeated LVEF monitoring as suggested by the&#xD;
      guidelines because of the negative impact on patient management and cost-effectiveness ratio&#xD;
      for the national health system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Speckle-tracking echocardiography is a noninvasive ultrasound imaging technique that allows&#xD;
      for early an objective and quantitative evaluation of global and regional myocardial&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New elevation of serum troponin detected with high sensitivity Troponin assays in patients&#xD;
      receiving anthracyclines also predicts subsequent LV dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are a class of intracellular calcium channels in various forms of&#xD;
      excitable tissues like muscles and neurons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In heart failure the RyR2 channels become abnormally active or &quot;leaky&quot; and are unable to&#xD;
      remain closed during diastole. This leads to an increase in spontaneous Ca+2 spark frequency&#xD;
      and dysregulated Ca+2 handling within the cardiomyocyte, resulting in decreased systolic&#xD;
      contraction and irregular contractile activity.&#xD;
