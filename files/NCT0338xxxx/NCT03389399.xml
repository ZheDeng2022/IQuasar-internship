      This is a single-arm study of patients who plan on starting brigatinib 90 mg QD or brigatinib&#xD;
      90 mg QD x 7 days to brigatinib 180 mg QD. Participants who enroll on this study protocol&#xD;
      will either be taking brigatinib in the context of an ongoing clinical trial, or as part of&#xD;
      standard of care treatment as licensed by FDA.&#xD;

    <description>This is a single-arm study of patients who plan on starting brigatinib 90 mg QD or brigatinib 90 mg QD x 7 days to brigatinib 180 mg QD. Study procedures include PFTs, 6minute walk test, Modified Borg dyspnea scale (mBDS), and phlebotomy before participants commence brigatinib and on days 2 and 8 of brigatinib treatment. Participants that develop a peak reduction in DLCO of 20% or more from baseline whose DLCO does not return to their baseline level on day 8 may, at the discretion of the investigator, undergo repeated testing on a subsequent time point (e.g., day 15) for serial observation to ensure resolution of EOPE if that is the suspected cause of DLCO reduction.</description>

        This is a prospective observational study. Brigatinib is not administered by this study.&#xD;
        Instead, participants will receive brigatinib as part of an ongoing thereapeutic clinical&#xD;
        trial or will be prescribed brigatinib, which is now an FDA-approved drug. Entry criteria&#xD;
        for this study will focus on those suitable for this observational study. Any&#xD;
        brigatinib-related safety procedure or follow-up will also be set forth by the FDA label or&#xD;
        the relevant clinical trial that is administering brigatinib to the participant in this&#xD;
        study.&#xD;

             procedures, and be available for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Be a male or female aged ≥ 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Must plan on receiving brigatinib at a starting dose of 90 mg QD, regardless of&#xD;
             whether they are receiving brigatinib as a part of clinical trial (if they meet&#xD;
             eligibility criteria for given clinical trial) or outside of clinical trial as part of&#xD;
             standard of care cancer treatment per the FDA license.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Suitable for treatment with brigatinib per either FDA labels, an acceptable clinical&#xD;

             This means that participants cannot be receiving other targeted therapies,&#xD;
             chemotherapies, or immunotherapies while on brigatinib (Exceptions:&#xD;
             nonimmunosuppressive supportive cancer therapies such as bone targeting agents [e.g.,&#xD;
             denosumab], and anti-emetics are allowed).&#xD;

             must have been given BEFORE Monday, April 24, 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have received cytotoxic chemotherapy, investigational agents, or cytotoxic doses of&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Have received immunotherapy within 28 days of first dose of brigatinib.&#xD;

          8. Be on corticosteroid within 48 hours prior to first dose of brigatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Have uncontrolled, or active cardiac, pulmonary or hematologic disease that can affect&#xD;
             interpretation of DLCO, specifically including, but not restricted to:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. Symptomatic or poorly controlled congestive heart failure (CHF) within 6 months&#xD;
