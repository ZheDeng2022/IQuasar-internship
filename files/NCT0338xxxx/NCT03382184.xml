      This study is being done to evaluate the effects of fractional photothermolysis (known as&#xD;
      laser resurfacing) using fractional laser for the induction of hair follicles via skin&#xD;
      rejuvenation in subjects with scalp alopecia (specifically, alopecia on the superior forehead&#xD;
      at the frontal hairline). Fractional photothermolysis has been shown to be effective in&#xD;
      promoting hair growth. The investigators will study 50 subjects who will be treated 6-10&#xD;
      times at 2-4 week intervals. Each participant will have half of their head treated with a&#xD;
      laser, either Fraxel DUAL 1550 or Halo by Sciton, and the other half of their head will be&#xD;
      left untreated as a control. Half of the individuals will randomly be assigned to the group&#xD;
      to be treated with Fraxel DUAL 1550, and the other half will be treated with Halo by Sciton.&#xD;
      Visual observation and digital, photographic, non-invasive imaging will be used to compare&#xD;
      the treated and untreated area to assess for differences in hair follicle stimulation rates,&#xD;
      number and density of hairs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As noted above, the types of lasers we plan to use include the non-ablative fractional laser&#xD;
      settings for the Fraxel DUAL 1550 and Halo by Sciton. A fractional laser is a laser that&#xD;
      directs an intense burst of laser energy on the skin. The treatment deposits heat deep into&#xD;
      the dermis to tighten skin and stimulate collagen remodeling. The necrotic (death of cells or&#xD;
      tissue) injury heals rapidly and adverse effects are few. Laser resurfacing is commonly used&#xD;
      for rejuvenation of the skin to improve quality, tone, and texture.&#xD;

      Introduction Alopecia is also known as hair loss, and it occurs due to aging, nutritional or&#xD;
      hormonal imbalance, or immune system etiology. It affects both males and females of different&#xD;
      ages and races. Hair may fall out in clumps, break off leaving short stubs, or become thinner&#xD;
      over time. The alopecia can be of a scarring or non-scarring nature. The most common form of&#xD;
      hair loss is non-scarring, or noncicatricial, alopecia. In this case, the damage is not&#xD;
      permanent, and although hair loss cannot be cured, it can be treated. Hair loss is usually&#xD;
      not a sign of an underlying medical disorder. However, hair loss may affect self-esteem and&#xD;
      cause anxiety affecting the quality of life. Scarring, or cicatricial, alopecia is a rare&#xD;
      disorder that destroys the hair follicle and replaces it with scar tissue, resulting in&#xD;
      permanent hair loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Causes&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many genes that contribute to hair loss, so it can be hereditary. There are also&#xD;
      other causes, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thyroid disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Autoimmune diseases like polycystic ovarian syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin conditions like Psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Options Topical Minoxidil (Rogaine) and anti-inflammatory medications, such as&#xD;
      topical and intra-lesional steroids, are used for alopecia. It is a solution that is applied&#xD;
      directly to the scalp to stimulate the hair follicle. It slows hair loss, and some people&#xD;
      grow new hair. Hair loss returns when the medication is stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finasteride is a prescription medicine that interferes with the production of a highly active&#xD;
      form of testosterone that is linked to baldness. It slows hair loss. It works slightly better&#xD;
      than minoxidil. Hair loss returns when you stop using the medicine. This prescription&#xD;
      medication is also sometimes given to women who have been through menopause. Its role in&#xD;
      female pattern hair loss is controversial, with both success and failure reported to occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dutasteride is similar to finasteride, but may be more effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hair transplants are also an option, though they are invasive and expensive. It consists of&#xD;
      removing tiny plugs of hair from areas where the hair is continuing to grow and placing them&#xD;
      in areas that are balding. This can cause minor scarring and possibly infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New Therapy Fractional photothermolysis was originally designed as a form of laser therapy to&#xD;
      treat wrinkles and scars. Although the link between laser treatment and hair growth is not&#xD;
      clear and the exact mechanism still unknown, there is evidence to support that laser&#xD;
      irradiation holds potential for the induction of hair follicles in subjects with alopecia.&#xD;
      Laser therapy has been reported to increase hair growth and activate hair follicles. The&#xD;
      lasers rejuvenate skin, and hair follicles are a part of skin, along with nails, so through&#xD;
      the rejuvenation of skin, these things also get rejuvenated. Clinical examples of&#xD;
      photo-induced hair growth include the paradoxical hair growth after laser hair removal, and&#xD;
      hair growth after some level of wound healing by lasers has been performed. Several studies&#xD;
      have been performed, analyzing the effectiveness of laser treatment of different settings,&#xD;
      and researchers have observed an increase in hair numbers and density on the treatment side&#xD;
      of the head. Improvements were most notable when the laser settings followed a low energy and&#xD;
      high density protocol. A review of the literature demonstrates that more research needs to be&#xD;
      done on this topic, but fractional photothermolysis may be a new, effective way to treat&#xD;
      different types of hair loss. The types of lasers the investigators plan to use include&#xD;
      Fraxel restore and Sciton Halo, a fractional hybrid laser that combines fractional erbium&#xD;
      ablative lasers with a fractional non-ablative laser. The use of the fractional&#xD;
      photothermolysis Fraxel laser and Sciton Halo laser have been approved by the FDA for&#xD;
      treatment of the hands, face, and body. Fraxel received aesthetic clearance in November 2003.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These lasers do not meet the definition of a significant risk device because the&#xD;
      investigators do not believe that they present a potential for serious risk to the health,&#xD;
      safety, or welfare of a subject. Side effects that have been reported from use with these&#xD;
      lasers include redness and tenderness in the area that it was applied, and these side effects&#xD;
      don't last more than a couple days. These lasers do not impair human health.&#xD;
