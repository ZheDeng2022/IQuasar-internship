  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multi-site, multi-level, and multi-component cluster randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      (RCT) to address poor dental utilization (attendance) and untreated caries among 3-6 year old&#xD;
      Medicaid-enrolled children attending well-child visits (WCV) in primary care settings. The&#xD;
      focus is on addressing factors (determinants) at the socio-ecological levels of the child's&#xD;
      environment: provider (pediatrician and nurse practitioner), practice/organization level, and&#xD;
      parent/caregiver level. Eighteen practices will be randomized to 2 arms: A) bundled&#xD;
      multi-level intervention consisting of: 1. training medical providers in the Common-Sense&#xD;
      Model of Self-Regulation theory-based education so that the provider delivers to the&#xD;
      parent/caregiver the following: i) Core oral health facts about dental caries, and ii)&#xD;
      prescription to visit the dentist and a list of dentists accepting Medicaid; 2. Integration&#xD;
      of oral health assessments into EMR for the provider to document in the child's medical&#xD;
      record; versus B) Control arm of medical providers receiving the American Academy of&#xD;
      Pediatrics (AAP) based oral health education and providing usual AAP-based care for oral&#xD;
      health. Each arm will consist of 9 practices. Children will be followed for 24 months to&#xD;
      determine dental utilization and changes in oral health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim is to examine the effectiveness of theory-based behavioral (provider-level)&#xD;
      and implementation (practice-level) bundled interventions versus enhanced usual care (AAP&#xD;
      based oral health education) delivered by providers at WCVs in increasing dental attendance&#xD;
      among 3-6 year old Medicaid-enrolled children. The secondary aims are to 1) assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of interventions on secondary outcomes (e.g. development of new caries, changes&#xD;
      in oral hygiene, oral health quality of life, frequency of sweet snacks and beverages, cost),&#xD;
      2) assess potential mediators and moderators to investigate the pathways through which the&#xD;
      multi-level interventions affect child primary and secondary outcomes, and 3) assess the&#xD;
      adoption, reach, fidelity, and maintenance of providers and practices that affect child&#xD;
      primary and secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that theory-based behavioral (provider-level) and implementation&#xD;
      (practice-level) bundled interventions delivered by providers at WCVs will increase dental&#xD;
      attendance among 3-6 year old Medicaid-enrolled children versus enhanced usual care (AAP&#xD;
      based oral health education) delivered by providers at WCVs.&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will utilize a cluster randomized clinical trial design (Phase III) in primary&#xD;
      care settings. Eighteen practices will be randomized to 2 arms: A) provider-level CSM&#xD;
      theory-based didactic and skills training to deliver oral health facts to parents, a&#xD;
      prescription and a list of dentists accepting Medicaid + practice-level EMR changes for&#xD;
      documenting oral health; B) AAP based didactic training with no provision of resources or&#xD;
      changes to the practice EMR. Arm A parents/caregivers will receive oral health facts and&#xD;
      prescription to take their child to the dentist and improve oral health behaviors in the&#xD;
      home, while Arm B parent/caregivers will receive usual AAP-based care for oral health. Each&#xD;
      arm will consist of 9 practices (n= 18), 33 to 34 providers (n= 67), and 512 parent/caregiver&#xD;
      and child dyads (n= 1024). Each parent/caregiver and child dyads will be recruited at the&#xD;
      first WCV and then followed for two consecutive WCVs (for a 24 month duration). Each provider&#xD;
      will complete training prior to enrolling any parent/caregiver and will participate in the&#xD;
      study for a total of 24 months duration. Immediately after randomization of practices,&#xD;
      recruitment will be rolled-out, i.e. parent/caregivers will be recruited during a 3-month&#xD;
      period in 6 practices at a time, with recruitment at all 18 practices expected to be&#xD;
      completed in 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is receipt of dental care assessed through data abstracted from Medicaid&#xD;
      claims files, clinical dental screenings and parent/caregiver Dental Attendance Questionnaire&#xD;
      responses. The secondary outcomes are development of new caries, changes in oral health&#xD;
      behaviors and oral health quality of life, dental care costs, and implementation of the&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be pediatric providers (Pediatricians/Nurse Practitioners) and&#xD;
      parent/caregivers and their 3-6 year old Medicaid-enrolled children from 18 primary care&#xD;
      practices located in 6 counties in NE Ohio. The study is offered to all pediatricians/nurse&#xD;
      practitioners in the recruited practices and will be offered to all eligible caregivers and&#xD;
      their children excluding those with serious medical or behavioral conditions which would&#xD;
      preclude them from participating in the dental screening. All provider and parent&#xD;
      participants meeting the eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the study upon signing the&#xD;
      consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      WCV #1 (Baseline): Before WCV #1, Providers (pediatrician/nurse practitioners) will receive&#xD;
      oral health didactic education and skills training (based on study arm) to communicate core&#xD;
      OH facts to parents/caregivers. They will complete pre- and post-tests before and after the&#xD;
      OH didactic education session. During the well-child visit, caregivers will complete the&#xD;
      following self-administered Baseline questionnaires: Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised&#xD;
      for Dental (IPQ-RD) and Parent Questionnaire. A dental hygienist will perform the child&#xD;
      dental screening examination and study staff will record results on the ICDAS Form. During&#xD;
      the WCV, the provider will deliver oral health facts, give a prescription to take the child&#xD;
      to the dentist + list of local Medicaid-accepting dentists, and document oral health in EMR,&#xD;
      based on study arm. Following the provider encounter, caregivers will provide feedback about&#xD;
      the OH information given to them during the visit with a short self-administered Exit&#xD;
      Questionnaire. At the end of the WCV, caregivers will be given the Follow-up IPQ-RD to be&#xD;
      completed and returned within 2 weeks (in postage paid envelope). At six months, caregivers&#xD;
      will report whether the child visited the dentist and also complete an annotated cost&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WCV #2 (12 month follow-up): Before WCV #2 Providers will receive an OH didactic education&#xD;
      booster session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During and after the well child visit, providers and parent/child dyads will complete the&#xD;
      same assessments and procedures done in WCV #1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WCV #3 (24 month follow-up): There is no provider education booster session before WCV #3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the well child visit, providers and parent/child dyads will complete the same&#xD;
      assessments and procedures done in WCV #1 and #2, except the IPQ-RD follow-up questionnaire.&#xD;
      The 6 month assessments will not be completed during the third well child visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Statistical Analysis: For the primary outcome, the investigators will use as an&#xD;
      overall dental attendance score the number of years (over the 24 months of follow-up) in&#xD;
      which the child visited the dentist. This will be an ordinal outcome with possible scores of&#xD;
      0, 1 or 2. To assess the intervention effect, the investigators will use a generalized&#xD;
      estimating equations (GEE) approach, with practices as clusters, based on a proportional odds&#xD;
      marginal model. The model covariates will include an intervention indicator variable (equal&#xD;
      to 1 for bundled intervention, 0 for enhanced usual care) and a set of baseline variables&#xD;
      representing potential confounders. A standard error correction (for example, the method by&#xD;
      Morel et al. 2003) will be used to adjust for a small number of clusters and 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals will be computed. This will be an intent-to treat analysis as all randomized&#xD;
      participants providing the necessary measurements - regardless of any lack of compliance -&#xD;
      will be included in the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event of missing data (for either year) for dental attendance, the investigators will&#xD;
      conduct sensitivity analyses by imputing responses under conservative assumptions (favoring&#xD;
      the null hypothesis) and re-running the analysis described above on the completed data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of Secondary Outcomes: Summary statistics (including means and standard errors) for&#xD;
      secondary outcomes will be calculated by intervention group. The same approach as above will&#xD;
      be used for binary or ordinal secondary outcomes (oral hygiene, frequency of sweet snacks and&#xD;
      beverages). Namely, ordinal outcomes for each variable will be defined that summarize&#xD;
      outcomes over time. For continuous outcomes (e.g., OH quality of life, cost), the above&#xD;
      method will be modified by using a linear model (identify link) for GEE, modeling the mean&#xD;
      response over time as a summary measure. These outcomes will each be tested for normality&#xD;
      using the Shapiro-Wilk statistic; outcomes for which normality is violated will be&#xD;
      transformed where appropriate or an alternative model used. For count outcomes (e.g., dft&#xD;
      accumulated over time), the investigators will use a loglinear model (log link) assuming a&#xD;
      negative binomial or other appropriate (e.g., zero-inflated negative binomial) distribution.&#xD;
      For proportion outcomes (e.g., dt/dft), the investigators will use GEE with a logit link,&#xD;
      assuming the proportion follows a beta binomial or zero-inflated beta binomial distribution.&#xD;
      Similarly, the investigators will fit appropriate GEE models to test for the effect of each&#xD;
      implementation strategy on the corresponding outcome (e.g., % prescriptions given as a&#xD;
      measure of adoption). As in the dental attendance analysis, the intervention indicator as&#xD;
      well as pertinent baseline variables will be included in the model. In addition, interaction&#xD;
      terms (baseline variables by intervention) will be included to test for possible effect&#xD;
      modification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For secondary analyses, a GLIMMIX model approach will be considered as an alternative, which&#xD;
      may more easily allow for more than one cluster level if needed. Another alternative approach&#xD;
      is to model the repeated measurements (again using GEE or GLIMMIX) which will add an&#xD;
      additional cluster level - namely, for individuals). Goodness of fit of alternative models&#xD;
      will be compared using QIC for GEE (or AIC for GLIMMIX).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing Data: In the likely event of missing responses, the investigators will first assess&#xD;
      (In the context of repeated measures analyses) whether the data are missing completely at&#xD;
      random (MCAR), that is, whether missingness of the given outcome is dependent only on&#xD;
      participant baseline characteristics and not further on the observed outcome at an earlier&#xD;
      time. This will be done by modeling missing data indicators for the repeated measurements of&#xD;
      each outcome using a GEE (or GLIMMIX) approach with a logit link and including appropriate&#xD;
      baseline (control) variables and the outcome at the previous time if available. The MCAR null&#xD;
      hypothesis will be rejected if the previous outcome has a statistically significant effect on&#xD;
      the probability of missing. A nonsignificant effect would support the use of GEE (which&#xD;
      assumes MCAR). In addition to assessing the overall effects of the interventions, the&#xD;
      investigators will investigate the mechanisms (or paths) through which interventions impact&#xD;
      dental attendance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study staff will collaborate and interact with the NIH-appointed Coordinating Center (CC)&#xD;
      to perform data management and quality control activities. Study data will be collected and&#xD;
      stored using the REDCap platform hosted by University of California-San Francisco, the home&#xD;
      institution of the CC. REDCap is a secure, web-based application designed to support remote&#xD;
      data capture for research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study forms will be completed by participants on paper, and subsequently entered into REDCap&#xD;
      by study staff, or on a tablet directly into REDCap. Paper forms will be securely stored in a&#xD;
      locked file cabinet. Recorded audio will be deleted from the digital recording device&#xD;
      immediately after being stored on a secure CWRU School of Dental Medicine network drive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data for this study will include: (1) dental screening data, (2) study questionnaires, (3)&#xD;
      abstracted medical data, (4) abstracted Medicaid dental claims data, (5) cost data (6) data&#xD;
      from observation/audiotaping of providers, and (7) EMR audit data. Additionally, audio&#xD;
      recordings will be used for fidelity monitoring. Form revisions should be minimal; however,&#xD;
      should they occur, changes will be submitted to the CC for updating and dissemination to&#xD;
      study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality control is primarily conducted at the study team level through internal processes of&#xD;
      data review/data monitoring using periodic custom reports generated by the CC. The CC will&#xD;
      assist with the design of project-specific custom reports. The CC will run regular validation&#xD;
      reports to detect data anomalies and will work with the local project staff to resolve any&#xD;
      data anomalies that arise during data entry. REDCap's native data resolution workflow will be&#xD;
      used to document and fix any data anomalies. The Data Manager will also respond to data&#xD;
      queries generated by the PI, Study Coordinator, or other study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CC will generate regular reports showing enrollment and potential data anomalies, which&#xD;
      will be sent to PIs, Project Coordinators, and other relevant study staff.&#xD;
