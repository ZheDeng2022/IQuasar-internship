  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of BKR-013 on average daily glucose (ADG)&#xD;
      levels in type 2 diabetes (T2D) subjects during 28 days of either placebo or active test&#xD;
      product administration. Subjects will serve as their own controls in this crossover design,&#xD;
      and ADG will be compared while a subject is on active test product versus while they received&#xD;
      placebo test product.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of a screening period followed by a 28-day treatment period, a 3 to 5 week&#xD;
      washout period, and a second treatment period. All subjects receive both active test product&#xD;
      and placebo, but the order in which they receive them (Part 1 or Part 2 of the study) is&#xD;
      randomized in this single crossover study. Fourteen subjects will be randomized to ensure&#xD;
      that 10 subjects complete both Part 1 and Part 2 of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a total of 7 study visits including screening. In Part 1, Visits 2, 3 and 4 occur 2&#xD;
      weeks apart; in Part 2, Visits 5, 6 and 7 also occur 2 weeks apart. Visits 4 and 7 are&#xD;
      overnight visits during which time hunger and satiety will be assessed and a Mixed Meal&#xD;
      Tolerance Test (MMTT) will be performed after an overnight fast. The MMTT requires use of an&#xD;
      indwelling IV catheter so that 11 blood draws can be more comfortably obtained over a period&#xD;
      of 4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be required to wear a glucose monitoring sensor during Part 1 and Part 2 of the&#xD;
      study in order to obtain ADG levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine chemistry and hematology tests are done at 4 timepoints during the study. An ECG and&#xD;
      physical exam is performed at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A rapid HbA1c will only be tested at screening; if the value is between 6.5% and 10.5%, all&#xD;
      other screening procedures will be performed; if the HbA1c value is not within the qualifying&#xD;
      range, the subject will be considered a screen failure and no other screening procedures will&#xD;
      be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are required to keep a daily diary to document dosing (twice daily), medication&#xD;
      changes and any adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety tests include chemistry/hematology, vital signs and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with type 2 diabetes must be under the care of a healthcare professional to take&#xD;
      part in this study. The test product BKR-013 is not designed to treat diabetes; it is being&#xD;
      evaluated as a non-prescription medical food for nutritional use in managing glucose levels.&#xD;
