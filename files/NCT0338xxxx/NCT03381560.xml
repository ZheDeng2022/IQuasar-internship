    <textblock>
      No previous studies have evaluated the frequency and severity of Chronic Obstructive&#xD;
      Pulmonary Disease (COPD) symptoms over a period of 24 hours (early morning, daytime and&#xD;
      nigth-time symptoms) in stable COPD patients seen in clinical practice in Brazil. COPD is a&#xD;
      common disease seen by primary care physicians and one of the most common diseases referred&#xD;
      and diagnosed by pulmonologists. According to previous studies, symptoms of COPD can have a&#xD;
      substantial impact on patients' quality of life and present a considerable degree of&#xD;
      variation for the same degree of airflow limitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to learn more about the burden of symptoms in the real-world&#xD;
      population of COPD patients in Brazil. With the real life data coming from this study, it&#xD;
      will be possible to describe 24-hour COPD symptoms in Brazil and their impact on patients'&#xD;
      quality of life and other PROs, the relationship with patients´ behaviour regarding adherence&#xD;
      to respiratory medication and burden of COPD symptoms in terms of the impact on health&#xD;
      economics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, the investigators will assess and characterize COPD symptoms over a&#xD;
      period of 24 hours, by collecting information about the respiratory symptoms experienced at&#xD;
      different times of the day and night in patients with stable COPD under real clinical&#xD;
      practice conditions. In addition, the investigators will evaluate the correlation between&#xD;
      each of these symptoms and the GOLD classification, adherence to respiratory treatment, level&#xD;
      of dyspnea, disease severity, comorbidities and physical activity. Finally, the investigators&#xD;
      will assess the relationship between 24h symptoms and direct cost related to treatment and&#xD;
      HRU in the previous year to assess the burden of COPD symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is based on a similar protocol applied in Latin-American patients, the&#xD;
      LASSYC Study. Extracted data will be used for a Brazilian analysis of these outcomes and may&#xD;
      be used in future analyses combined with the results of LASSYC Study for a global view of&#xD;
      Latin America.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a preventable and treatable disease with some&#xD;
      significant extrapulmonary effects that may contribute to the severity in individual&#xD;
      patients. Its pulmonary component is characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully&#xD;
      reversible. The airflow limitation is usually progressive and associated with an abnormal&#xD;
      inflammatory response of the lung to noxious particles or gases (i). Although smoking is one&#xD;
      of the major and most frequent causes of COPD, other factors may be associated with its&#xD;
      development. The narrowing of the airways, which is one of the main features of COPD, results&#xD;
      from a combination of small airway disease and parenchymal destruction, as well as structural&#xD;
      changes from the chronic inflammatory process. For this reason bronchoconstriction is one of&#xD;
      the key targets of pharmacological interventions in the management of COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This disease affects globally around 15% of all adults older than 40 years, resulting in&#xD;
      pulmonary and extrapulmonary comorbidities and significant mortality (1,ii). The worldwide&#xD;
      prevalence in people aged over 40 years is 10.1% overall, 11.8% for men, and 8.5% for women,&#xD;
      according to the BOLD Study (iii). It is the fourth leading cause of death in the world and&#xD;
      its prevalence is projected to increase in the coming years due to continued exposure to COPD&#xD;
      risk factors (1). Two Latin-American epidemiological studies, the PLATINO Project iv and&#xD;
      PREPOCOL v, have provided information on the prevalence of COPD in this region. PLATINO is a&#xD;
      study on prevalence of COPD in individuals ≥40 years, carried out in five Latin American&#xD;
      cities: Mexico City (Mexico), São Paulo (Brazil), Montevideo (Uruguay), Santiago de Chile&#xD;
      (Chile), and Caracas (Venezuela). Using as diagnostic criteria post-BD FEV1/FVC ratio&#xD;
      &amp;lt;0.70, the overall prevalence of COPD in PLATINO is 14.3% (ranging from 7.8% in Mexico&#xD;
      City to 19.7% in Montevideo) and in the city of São Paulo is 15.8 % (4,vi). Using the lower&#xD;
      limit of normal criteria (LLN) of the post- BD FEV1/FVC ratio, the global COPD prevalence in&#xD;
      PLATINO is 11.7%. This is even lower (9.5%) when using the post-BD FEV1/VEF6 &amp;lt; LLN ratio&#xD;
      (vii). PREPOCOL (5) assessed the prevalence in five cities in Colombia and reported an&#xD;
      overall prevalence of 8.9% (from 6.2% in Barranquilla to 13,5% in Medellin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptoms of COPD - including progressive dyspnea, chronic cough, excessive sputum production&#xD;
      and decreased exercise tolerance - may considerably affect the patients' daily activities and&#xD;
      quality of life (1,viii,ix). COPD symptoms have been reported to be worse at night and in the&#xD;
      early morning (x,xi), which may be reflected in disturbed sleep and limitations on morning&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is being recognized as an important&#xD;
      outcome when evaluating patients with COPD and several studies have demonstrated that those&#xD;
      patients in more severe disease stages presented worse HRQoL and it varied greatly within&#xD;
      each stage of disease severity (xii).&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the patient´s point of view, dyspnea is one of the major symptoms that affect their&#xD;
      quality of life (xiii). However, dyspnea varies considerably for the same degree of airflow&#xD;
      limitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is reported that poor patient's adherence to inhaled medication is shared by COPD and&#xD;
      asthma patients (xiv). Non-adherence to inhaled therapy is associated with inadequate symptom&#xD;
      control, higher healthcare utilization and costs, as well as decreases in health-related&#xD;
      quality of life (12- 14). In practice guidelines of the Global Initiative for Asthma&#xD;
      Management [GINA) (xv) and Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) (1)]&#xD;
      is now specifically recommended evaluation and follow-up of the patient's adherence to&#xD;
      inhaler devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies (xvi, xvii, xviii, xix) have shown that physical activity in COPD is&#xD;
      associated with a better quality of life and less morbidity and mortality. In addition,&#xD;
      comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular disease, anxiety and depressive disorders, lung&#xD;
      cancer and osteoporosis are frequently observed in COPD patients and may affect COPD outcomes&#xD;
      (xx). Sleep disorder is also common in COPD patients. In epidemiologic studies, more than 50%&#xD;
      of patients with COPD complained of difficulty to maintain and initiate sleep, and 25%&#xD;
      complained of excessive daytime sleepiness (xxi). The COTE Index establishes the relationship&#xD;
      between these main comorbidities and the risk of death over a median of 51 months. This is a&#xD;
      simple, disease-specific comorbidity index that helps assess the risk of mortality in&#xD;
      patients with COPD (xxii).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been recently published the ASSESS Study (xxiii) regarding a cohort of 727 European&#xD;
      patients. This observational study assessed the prevalence, severity and relationship between&#xD;
      nighttime, early morning and daytime COPD symptoms and explored the relationship between&#xD;
      24-hour symptoms and other results reported by DPOC patients. It was shown that more than&#xD;
      half of patients experienced COPD symptoms throughout the whole 24-hour period, and there was&#xD;
      a significant relationship between them and the worse patient-reported outcome, suggesting&#xD;
      that improving 24- hour symptoms should be an important consideration in the management of&#xD;
      COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COPD is associated with a substantial economic burden due to direct healthcare costs e.g.&#xD;
      unplanned medical visits and hospitalization due to exacerbations (1,xxiv). More frequent&#xD;
      exacerbations are associated with: more frequent/longer hospital stays; increased mortality&#xD;
      risk; reduced quality of life (xxv); as well as indirect/societal costs due to loss of&#xD;
      productivity and premature death in patients with COPD further increasing the economic burden&#xD;
      of this disease (1,24-xxvi).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      No previous studies have evaluated the frequency and severity of COPD symptoms over a period&#xD;
      of 24 hours (nighttime, early morning and daytime symptoms) in stable COPD patients seen in&#xD;
      clinical practice in Brazil. COPD is a common disorder seen by primary care physicians and&#xD;
      one of the most common diseases referred and diagnosed by pulmonologists. According to&#xD;
      studies, COPD symptoms can have a substantial impact on patients' quality of daily life and&#xD;
      present a considerable degree of variation for the same degree of airflow limitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to learn more about the burden of symptoms in the real-world population of&#xD;
      COPD patients in Brazil. With the real life data from this study, it will be possible to&#xD;
      describe 24-hour COPD symptoms and their impact on patients' quality of life and other PRO,&#xD;
      the relationship with patients' behaviour regarding adherence to respiratory medication and&#xD;
      the burden of COPD symptoms in terms of the impact on health economics in Brazil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, the investigators will assess and characterize COPD symptoms over a&#xD;
      period of 24 hours, by collecting information about the respiratory symptoms experienced at&#xD;
      different times of the day and night-time in patients with stable COPD under real clinical&#xD;
      practice conditions. In addition, the investigators will evaluate the correlation between&#xD;
      each of these symptoms and the 2013 GOLD classification, adherence to respiratory treatment,&#xD;
      level of dyspnea, disease severity, comorbidities and physical activity. Finally, the&#xD;
      investigators will assess the relationship between 24h symptoms and direct cost related to&#xD;
      treatment and HRU in the previous year to assess the burden of COPD symptoms.&#xD;
