  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and cancer often have complicated courses while&#xD;
      hospitalized and often deal with pain, anxiety and depression. Advances in the field of&#xD;
      technology provide potential avenues for innovative and improved care models for our&#xD;
      patients. Virtual reality (VR) has been recently utilized to improve anxiety and pain in a&#xD;
      variety of patient populations including children undergoing elective surgery and children&#xD;
      experiencing intravenous cannulation in the Emergency Department. Patients with SCD and&#xD;
      cancer, both adults and children, are a group of patients that can benefit from VR as part of&#xD;
      their care. Over the past four years, our team has successfully implemented several&#xD;
      self-developed mobile applications (&quot;apps&quot;) for our patients, in addition to integrating&#xD;
      objective data (heart rate, activity, stress) from wearable activity trackers. The&#xD;
      investigators now propose implementing a feasibility study followed by a pilot study and&#xD;
      randomized-controlled trial of the use of VR in patients with SCD and cancer. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to assess pain and anxiety prior to the session as well as following the&#xD;
      session in hospitalized patients and outpatients with SCD and cancer. The sessions will&#xD;
      include a ten-minute relaxation response introductory narrative segment (deep breathing and&#xD;
      mindfulness) followed by a ten-minute narrated and immersive VR. Heart rate will be tracked&#xD;
      using an Apple iWatch for 30 minutes prior to the session, during the session, and following&#xD;
      the session. We anticipate VR will not only be a feasible method to provide non-pharmacologic&#xD;
      treatment, but will also significantly reduce pain and anxiety.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The investigators will perform a feasibility and pilot study evaluating relaxation response&#xD;
      (narration leading through deep-breathing, mindfulness, and other relaxation techniques)&#xD;
      followed by VR in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and caner. The VR headset (NeuTab&#xD;
      VR Virtual Reality Headset, Dynamic Virtual Viewer, or similar device) used will be&#xD;
      compatible with an iPhone purchased by the PI. The VR session will be narrated by Jon&#xD;
      Seskevich, RN. Patients will be provided with a second iPhone to play the recording while the&#xD;
      other iPhone is used to display the VR session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will first be provided a consent form and consented. They will have the&#xD;
      opportunity to ask questions prior to and following consent. They will subsequently give a&#xD;
      pain score and fill out a GAD-7 (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) and PHQ-9 (Patient Health&#xD;
      Questionnaire) form. They will be taught how to use the VR headset. Patients will listen to a&#xD;
      recording by Jon Seskevich, RN of a ten-minute relaxation response. An iPhone will then be&#xD;
      placed in the VR headset, the recording started, and the headset placed on the patient. The&#xD;
      VR scene is available through Provata VR app and has been previously chosen prior to the&#xD;
      start of the study. Following this, patients will again give a pain score as well as complete&#xD;
      another GAD-7, PHQ-9, Presence Questionnaire, and Patient's Global Impression of Change&#xD;
      (PGIC) form. Patients will be asked to fill out pain score and general health questions via&#xD;
      the TRU-Pain app. Patients will then be able to ask questions/provide further feedback.&#xD;

A negative score change indicates a decrease in anxiety symptoms and a positive score change indicates an increase in anxiety symptoms.</description>
