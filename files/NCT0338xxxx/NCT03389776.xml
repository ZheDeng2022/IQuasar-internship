  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endotracheal tubes (ETT) and laryngeal mask airways (LMA) are devices used to help breathing&#xD;
      whilst patients are asleep for surgery. Children may have a more satisfying experience if the&#xD;
      rate of of post operative sore throat (POST) and hoarseness (PH) could be reduced. The&#xD;
      incidence of POST and PH may be as high as 42% in children undergoing anesthesia. ETTs and&#xD;
      LMAs require inflation of a cuff after insertion to obtain a seal to a patient's airway for&#xD;
      them to be effective. It is recommended that cuff pressures are checked after insertion and&#xD;
      inflation with a pressure checking device but this does not occur in all routine anesthetic&#xD;
      practice. Overinflation of these cuffs may cause damage to the airway by exerting pressure on&#xD;
      surrounding structures. Studies have shown both children and adults to have increased risk of&#xD;
      POST with higher LMA pressure. The number of times it takes to successfully insert a LMA has&#xD;
      also been associated with POST as has female gender and older age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly to LMAs, multiple insertion attempts of ETT insertion, female gender and a larger&#xD;
      size are more likely to cause POST and PH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although patients with uncuffed have a higher incidence of POST than those with a cuffed ETT,&#xD;
      when using cuffed tubes ETT, POST occurs more often as cuff pressure increases and should&#xD;
      therefore be routinely measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The location of a patient's sore throat may vary. It may be intermittent or constant, or&#xD;
      described as difficulty in swallowing, painful swallowing or hoarse voice and may there may&#xD;
      be difference locations within the throat. In the current literature there is no one&#xD;
      definition of what constitutes a sore throat or how or when it should be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that occurrence and severity of POST could be determined by various factors&#xD;
      other than the pressure of the cuff alone. In particular, the pressure of cuff, the duration&#xD;
      of anesthesia, the airway manipulations, could all be factors determining the occurrence of&#xD;
      postoperative sore throat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above hypothesis, Investigators planed to perform a prospective cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: to determine the occurrence and severity of post-anaesthesia sore throat in children&#xD;
      undergoing surgical procedures with LMA or ETT placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If clear factors are demonstrated for POST and PH in pediatric population then measures can&#xD;
      be taken to reduce them and thereby improve outcome and patient satisfaction.&#xD;

      The study is a prospective, descriptive study, involving patient interview and objective data&#xD;
      collected as part of routine anesthetic care. No intervention will take place. Once&#xD;
      identified from a theatre list, patients/parents will be approached preoperatively and&#xD;
      consent taken to participate. If inclusion criteria are met and consent gained the&#xD;
      preoperative questionnaire will be completed to obtain information regarding pain, nausea,&#xD;
      sore throat, itching, thirst and hunger. Each symptom will be graded none, mild, moderate,&#xD;
      severe. Intraoperative data will be collected after surgery whilst the child is in the&#xD;
      recovery room. This is objective data obtained from the anesthetic chart. Prior to discharge&#xD;
      to the ward the child will undergo a second interview answering the same questions as he/she&#xD;
      did preoperatively (a further 1-2 minutes). Any child who has a sore throat in the recovery&#xD;
      room will then be followed up 2 hours later on the ward with a further questionnaire. This&#xD;
      will include questions about the location of the sore throat, severity and voice changes&#xD;
      (5-10 mins). This will be the end of the participants input.&#xD;
