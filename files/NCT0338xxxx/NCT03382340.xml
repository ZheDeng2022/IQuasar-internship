    <textblock>
      Phase 1 is an open-label, multi-center dose escalation/dose expansion study designed to&#xD;
      assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) for the recommended phase 2 dose&#xD;
      (RP2D) of IMX-110. The RP2D will be evaluated in a further dose expansion Phase 2a study&#xD;
      submitted.&#xD;
