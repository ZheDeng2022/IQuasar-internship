  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The sum of medical interventions can do more harm than good. Supporting patients' resources&#xD;
      instead of combating disease might effectively help reducing &quot;too much medicine&quot;. A first&#xD;
      step to approach this goal would be to have a classification tool that captures the essential&#xD;
      features of a meaningful human life, namely body functions, activities, and participation.&#xD;
      The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) is the perfect&#xD;
      framework to distinguish between necessary and unnecessary medical interventions by offering&#xD;
      descriptions of outcomes of medical and non-medical interventions. However, though adequate&#xD;
      and comprehensive in theory, it is impracticable in a primary care setting. Therefore, a core&#xD;
      set of the ICF for the old and very old in primary care is needed. Four preparatory studies&#xD;
      according to the international development guideline will be carried out: a systematic&#xD;
      literature review to capture the research perspective, a qualitative study to assess the&#xD;
      patients' perspective, an experts' survey and an empirical multicenter study to detect the&#xD;
      clinical perspective.&#xD;

      The systematic literature review captures the perspective of researchers on functioning of&#xD;
      community dwelling people aged 75 years and older. Different literature databases will be&#xD;
      searched combining search terms referring to community dwelling elderly and to functioning.&#xD;
      Two investigators will independently screen the abstracts and titles for eligibility. In&#xD;
      reviewing the full articles, the underlying concepts that are contained in the measures and&#xD;
      in the article text will be identified, and then linked to the ICF categories using&#xD;
      established linking rules. A frequency analysis will be conducted on the linked categories.&#xD;
      The ICF categories that are identified in at least 5% of all publications will be included in&#xD;
      the list of candidate categories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The qualitative study aims to identify which aspects of functioning, environmental and&#xD;
      personal factors are most important to community dwelling people aged 75 years and older.&#xD;
      Participants will be provided with a camera for one week to take pictures of activities they&#xD;
      are no longer able to perform or activities they still perform well. On the basis of these&#xD;
      pictures, individual interviews and focus groups will be conducted. Meaningful concepts will&#xD;
      be identified and linked to the ICF categories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expert survey aims to gather opinions of experts on aspects of functioning and&#xD;
      environmental factors that are relevant for community dwelling people aged 75 years and&#xD;
      older. Meaningful concepts will be identified and linked to the ICF categories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The empirical multicenter study aims to identify the most common problems experienced by&#xD;
      community-dwelling people aged 75 and older using clinical assessments. A health professional&#xD;
      will conduct semi-structured interviews based on the extended ICF checklist. This is a&#xD;
      selection of 125 categories that are considered to be most important for clinical practice.&#xD;
      This list is extended by other categories thought to be sensitive to functioning in old age.&#xD;
