  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, randomized, Phase 2 study designed to compare the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of pegilodecakin in combination with nivolumab versus nivolumab alone in&#xD;
      participants with stage IV / metastatic wild type non-small cell lung cancer and tumors with&#xD;
      low tumor expression of PD-L1 (0-49%).&#xD;

    The CYPRESS-2 trial was closed early after the planned final analysis because the risk benefit&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Best Overall Response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) [Objective Response Rate (ORR)]</measure>
    <time_frame>From Date of Randomization to Progressive Disease, Death from Any cause (Up to 6 months after the last participant randomized)</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response rate is the best overall tumor response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as classified by the independent central review according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1). CR is a disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. PR is an at least 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum diameter) without progression of non-target lesions or appearance of new lesions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Date of Randomization to Death Due to Any Cause (Up to 6 months after the last participant randomized)</time_frame>
    <description>OS is defined as the time from first day of therapy to the date of death from any cause. Participants who were alive at the end of the follow-up period or were lost to follow-up, OS was censored on the last date the participant was known to be alive.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Date of Randomization to Progressive Disease or Death Due to Any Cause (Up to 6 months after the last participant randomized)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from the day of randomization to the first evidence of progression as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.0 (RECIST v1.0) criteria or death from any cause. Progressive Disease (PD) is a 20% increase over the smallest sum of target lesions or new lesions. Participants who died without a reported prior disease progression were considered to have progressed on the day of their death. Participants who did not progress and were subsequently lost to follow-up had their data censored at the day of last tumor assessment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Control Rate (DCR): Percentage of Participants With a Best Overall Response of Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR) or Stable Disease (SD)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Date of Randomization to Objective Progressive Disease or Start of New Anti-Cancer Therapy (Up to 6 Months after the last participant randomization)</time_frame>
    <description>Disease control rate (DCR) is the percentage of participants with a best overall response of CR, PR or SD as defined by RECIST v1.1. CR is defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no appearance of new lesions. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum LD), no progression of non-target lesions, and no appearance of new lesions. SD is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD) for target lesions, no progression of non-target lesions, and no appearance of new lesions. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, with reference being the smallest sum on study and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or 1 or more new lesions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>From Date of Randomization to Death Due to Any Cause (Up to 6 months after the last participant randomized)</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response is defined as the time from the date measurement criteria for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) are first met until the first date that disease is recurrent or objective progression is observed, per RECIST 1.1, or the date of death from any cause in the absence of objectively determined disease progression or recurrence. Participants known to be alive and without disease progression will be censored at the time of the last adequate tumor assessment.</description>

        <description>Objective response rate is the best overall tumor response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as classified by the independent central review according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1). CR is a disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. PR is an at least 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum diameter) without progression of non-target lesions or appearance of new lesions.</description>

SD is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD) for target lesions, no progression of non-target lesions, and no appearance of new lesions. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, with reference being the smallest sum on study and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or 1 or more new lesions.</description>
