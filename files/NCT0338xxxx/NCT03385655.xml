      The purpose of the pre-study screening is to test for DNA abnormalities or biomarkers.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This testing will be done on a samples of blood to see whether or not patients are eligible&#xD;
      to take part in one of the sub-studies. Each study will be looking at what effects a new drug&#xD;
      or drugs has on prostate cancer and will also be looking at the side effects of treatment.&#xD;
      The purpose of the main studies is to see if the biomarkers that were identified screening&#xD;
      samples can help predict which patients are most likely to be helped by that drug or drugs&#xD;
      and to see how the cancer cells respond to treatment.&#xD;

             on this trial must be treated and followed at the participating centre. This implies&#xD;
             there must be reasonable geographical limits (for example: 1 ½ hour's driving&#xD;
             distance) placed on patients being considered for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Investigators must assure themselves the patients enrolled on this trial will be&#xD;
             available for complete documentation of the treatment, adverse events, response&#xD;
             assessment and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must agree to return to their primary care facility for any adverse events,&#xD;
             which may occur through the course of the trial.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  In addition to routine contraceptive methods, &quot;effective contraception&quot; also includes&#xD;

             of pregnancy prevention) defined as a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or&#xD;
             bilateral tubal ligation, or vasectomy / vasectomized partner. However, if at any&#xD;
             point a previously celibate patient chooses to become heterosexually active during the&#xD;
             time period for use of contraceptive measures outlined in the protocol, he is&#xD;
