  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain (LBP) is a severe epidemic in the world. Despite its high prevalence, 90% of&#xD;
      the cases have no identifiable cause. Approximately 44% of them experience recurrent LBP&#xD;
      within one year and 10% of them develop chronic LBP that lasts for three months or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanically, the lumbar spine is unstable and requires spinal muscle to maintain spinal&#xD;
      stability and to prevent injuries. Lumbar multifidus (LM) muscle is thought to be the major&#xD;
      spinal stabilizer responsible for spinal stability and spinal proprioception. Prior studies&#xD;
      have revealed that increased fat infiltration, atrophy or activation deficits of LM in&#xD;
      patients with LBP as compared to asymptomatic individuals. Unfortunately, inconsistent&#xD;
      findings have also been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although prior research attempted to determine if abnormal LM characteristics can inform&#xD;
      clinical decision-making, their results are limited because they only investigated a single&#xD;
      LM characteristic at a time, which might not reflect the actual LM condition. Further, many&#xD;
      studies adopted cross-sectional design that could not reveal the casual relations between&#xD;
      abnormal LM characteristics and LBP. As such, the current study aims to identify specific LM&#xD;
      characteristics that can predict new episode of LBP in asymptomatic individuals, and&#xD;
      recurrent/chronic LBP in individuals with LBP at baseline.&#xD;

      Low back pain (LBP) is a severe epidemic in the world. Despite its high prevalence, 90% of&#xD;
      the cases have no identifiable cause. While most people with LBP recover shortly after onset,&#xD;
      approximately 44% of them experience recurrent LBP within one year and 10% of them develop&#xD;
      chronic LBP that lasts for three months or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanically, the lumbar spine is unstable and requires spinal muscle to maintain spinal&#xD;
      stability and to prevent injuries. Lumbar multifidus (LM) muscle is thought to be the major&#xD;
      spinal stabilizer responsible for spinal stability and spinal proprioception. Different&#xD;
      cross-sectional studies have revealed that increased fat infiltration, atrophy or activation&#xD;
      deficits of LM in patients with LBP as compared to asymptomatic individuals. Research has&#xD;
      shown that abnormal morphology or activation of LM is associated with LBP intensity/location,&#xD;
      or LBP-related disability. Unfortunately, inconsistent findings have also been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although prior research attempted to determine if abnormal LM characteristics can inform&#xD;
      clinical decision-making, their results are limited because they only investigated a single&#xD;
      LM characteristic at a time, which might not reflect the actual LM condition. Further, many&#xD;
      studies adopted cross-sectional design that could not reveal the casual relations between&#xD;
      abnormal LM characteristics and LBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the above, the current study aims to identify specific LM characteristics that can&#xD;
      predict new episode of LBP in asymptomatic individuals, and recurrent/chronic LBP in&#xD;
      individuals with LBP at baseline.&#xD;
