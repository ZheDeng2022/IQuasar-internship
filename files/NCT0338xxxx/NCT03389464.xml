      The aim of the present study is to investigate whether confronting depressive patients with&#xD;
      their dysfunctional core beliefs via a computer program results in a reduction of the&#xD;
      patients' dysfunctional beliefs. Patients will be presented with a virtual agent confronting&#xD;
      them with their dysfunctional core beliefs (e.g. &quot;You are worthless&quot;). Participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to contradict these virtual agents (e.g. &quot;That's not true, I'm a wonderful&#xD;
      person&quot;).&#xD;

      The aim of the present study is to investigate whether confronting depressive patients with&#xD;
      their dysfunctional core beliefs via a computer program results in a reduction of the&#xD;
      patients' dysfunctional beliefs. Participants will randomly be assigned to the experimental&#xD;
      or control group. In the course of the study, experimental participants will be presented&#xD;
      with a virtual agent confronting them with their dysfunctional core beliefs (e.g. &quot;You are&#xD;
      worthless&quot;). Experimental participants will be instructed to contradict these virtual agents&#xD;
      (e.g. &quot;That's not true, I'm a wonderful person&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group of inpatients (male/female) suffering from depression will participate in the study.&#xD;
      The patients will be recruited at the &quot;Klinik und Poliklinik für Psychiatrie und&#xD;
      Psychotherapie der Universität Regensburg am Bezirksklinikum Regensburg&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be divided into five sessions taking place on consecutive days. Furthermore,&#xD;
      there will be a follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the course of this session participants will be informed about the experimental procedure&#xD;
      and sign an informed consent. Exclusion criteria will be assessed via self-report and by&#xD;
      consulting the responsible therapist. Participants will be asked to fill in the German&#xD;
      version of the Beck Depression Inventory-II and German version of the Dysfunctional Attitude&#xD;
      Scale. The experimenter will explain the concept of dysfunctional &quot;core beliefs&quot; to the&#xD;
      participants and give examples. Participants will be asked to write down three individual&#xD;
      core beliefs (e.g. &quot;I'm worthless&quot;) and to rate how much they believe in each of these three&#xD;
      core beliefs (on a scale ranging from 0% to 100%). Furthermore, participants will be asked to&#xD;
      write down alternative beliefs for each of the three core beliefs and to rate (on a scale&#xD;
      ranging from 0% to 100%) how much they believe in these alternative beliefs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sessions 2 to 4 (intervention):&#xD;
&#xD;
      During these sessions, the experimental participants will be seated in front of a computer.&#xD;
      The experimenter will read aloud the participants' core beliefs with the virtual agent on the&#xD;
      computer screen moving his lips accordingly. Thus, participants will get the impression of&#xD;
      the agent speaking to them. Participants will be instructed to contradict the agent. There&#xD;
      will be 10 trials per core belief (30 trials per session, 90 trials in total). At the end of&#xD;
      each session, participants will be asked to rate how much they believe in each of their core&#xD;
      beliefs as well as in each of their alternative beliefs. Furthermore, they will be asked to&#xD;
      rate (on a scale ranging from 0% to 100%) how hard it was for them to contradict the virtual&#xD;
      agent. Control subjects will not undergo sessions 2 to 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 5:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will fill in the German version of the Beck Depression Inventory-II and the&#xD;
      German version of Dysfunctional Attitude Scale and give a conviction rating for each of their&#xD;
      three core beliefs and each of their alternative beliefs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up (after two weeks):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will fill in the German version of the Beck Depression Inventory-II and the&#xD;
      German version of the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale and give a conviction rating for each of&#xD;
      their three core beliefs and each of their alternative beliefs.&#xD;
