  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caused by Toxoplasma gondii, toxoplasmosis is mostly asymptomatic except in immunocompromised&#xD;
      individuals and infants infected in utero. Congenital toxoplasmosis (CT) results from the&#xD;
      transplacental passage of the parasite, which occurs in 30% of cases of primary infection&#xD;
      during pregnancy. Neonatal biological diagnosis of toxoplasmosis is essential in the case of&#xD;
      (i) suggestive clinical signs in the newborn with no information on the serological status of&#xD;
      the mother, (ii) seroconversion diagnosed during pregnancy, (iii) not or poorly followed&#xD;
      pregnancy, and (iiii) for enhanced effectiveness of treatments administered as soon as&#xD;
      possible to the newborn. Given the limitations of current diagnostic tests, the&#xD;
      characterization of specific immunoglobulin (Ig)G neo-synthesized by the newborn would be of&#xD;
      great help for an early diagnosis of CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the TOXODIAG project is to validate and evaluate the ELISPOT&#xD;
      (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent SPOT assay) method for detecting, in the newborn, B lymphocytes&#xD;
      (LyB) sensitized in utero to produce T. gondii specific immunoglobulins (Ig) following a&#xD;
      primary infection of the mother during the pregnancy. More precisely, the detection and&#xD;
      quantification of LyB secreting IgG and IgM specific for T. gondii using the ELISPOT method&#xD;
      will be applied i) to mononuclear cells of women in seroconversion following a toxoplasmic&#xD;
      primo-infection during pregnancy and ii) to cord blood mononuclear cells of newborns&#xD;
      suspected of CT, in comparison to positive and negative infection controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To reach this goal, TOXODIAG is a diagnostic, multicentric, prospective, non-randomized,&#xD;
      comparative and controlled study. It will be performed in 3 parallel groups of pregnant women&#xD;
      performing prenatal follow-up and giving birth in the maternity wards of 3 hospitals of the&#xD;
      AP-HP (Louis MOURIER, Bichat-Claude Bernard and Cochin) which ensure mother/child follow-up&#xD;
      and biological sampling, with great gynecology and obstetrics expertise. Sixty women will be&#xD;
      selected and included into 3 groups according to toxoplasmic seroconversion during pregnancy&#xD;
      (n=30), positive (n=15) or negative (n=15) toxoplasma serology. The necessary biological&#xD;
      material will consist in additional blood tubes which will be taken at the same time as those&#xD;
      performed for the usual pregnancy follow-up examinations and will correspond to maternal&#xD;
      peripheral blood at inclusion, seroconversion and delivery as well as cord blood.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Toxoplasmosis is a cosmopolitan parasitosis that affects one third of the world's population.&#xD;
      This infection, caused by Toxoplasma gondii, is mostly asymptomatic except in&#xD;
      immunocompromised individuals and infants infected in utero. Congenital toxoplasmosis (CT)&#xD;
      results from the transplacental passage of the parasite, which occurs in 30% of cases of&#xD;
      primary infection during pregnancy. The clinical consequences are all the more serious when&#xD;
      fetal contamination is early (death in utero, premature delivery or term childbirth with&#xD;
      perivisceral involvement) and result in mainly neuro-ocular attacks in case of later&#xD;
      contamination. Pregnant women or women of childbearing age therefore constitute a group at&#xD;
      risk and are exposed differently according to their geographical situation and food&#xD;
      consumption. Neonatal biological diagnosis of toxoplasmosis is essential in the case of (i)&#xD;
      suggestive clinical signs in the newborn with no information on the serological status of the&#xD;
      mother, (ii) seroconversion diagnosed during pregnancy, (iii) not or poorly followed&#xD;
      pregnancy, and (iiii) for enhanced effectiveness of treatments administered as soon as&#xD;
      possible to the newborn. This diagnosis is based mainly on parasite research in the neonatal&#xD;
      amniotic fluid or placenta by PCR and / or inoculation in mice, as well as on serological&#xD;
      tests. Immunoglobulins (Ig) A and IgM do not cross the placental barrier and represent good&#xD;
      markers of congenital infection in the newborn. Nevertheless, they are not specific to an&#xD;
      acute infection and are no longer detectable at birth in cases of infections contracted by&#xD;
      the mother before the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. The detection of IgG synthesized by the&#xD;
      child has a diagnostic value only after 6 months of life, once the materno-transmitted IgG&#xD;
      have been eliminated, and the techniques comparing the IgG response profiles of the mother&#xD;
      and the child to a plurality of toxoplasmic antigens remain difficult to interpret (western&#xD;
      blot, ELIFA). It is nevertheless a combination of these different tests that makes up the&#xD;
      decision tree for a neonatal biological diagnosis of CT. The characterization of specific IgG&#xD;
      neo-synthesized by the newborn would be of great help for an early diagnosis of congenital&#xD;
      infection by T. gondii. The present project consists in determining the presence in the&#xD;
      neonate of B lymphocytes (LyB) sensitized in utero to produce specific IgG in case of CT.&#xD;
      This approach can be envisaged because of the maturity acquired by the fetal LyB from the end&#xD;
      of the first trimester of pregnancy, demonstrated by their ability to produce high affinity&#xD;
      Ig in the case of maternal infection or neonatal immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is diagnostic, multicentric, prospective, non-randomized, comparative and&#xD;
      controlled. It will be performed in 3 parallel groups of pregnant women performing prenatal&#xD;
      follow-up and giving birth in the maternity wards of 3 hospitals of the AP-HP which ensure&#xD;
      mother/child follow-up and biological sampling, with great gynecology and obstetrics&#xD;
      expertise. Sixty patients will be selected and included according to the following&#xD;
      distribution:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Positive control group (women with positive toxoplasma serology): 15 patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Negative control group (women with negative toxoplasma serology): 15 patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group of women diagnosed with toxoplasmic seroconversion during pregnancy: 30 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-recruiting centers will be HUPC and HUPNVS biology laboratories for the realization of&#xD;
      serological tests and expertise in biological diagnosis and IRD UMR 216 for coordination,&#xD;
      laboratory experiments and expertise in immunology.&#xD;
