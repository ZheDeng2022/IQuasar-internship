  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of transfusion of TBX-3400 in patients with stage III and IV melanoma&#xD;
      resistant or refractory to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's own blood cells are exposed to a protein that has been shown in the laboratory&#xD;
      to result in anti-tumor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that TBX-3400 cells will enhance anti-tumor activity and improve the&#xD;
      body's immune response.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study will consist of a Dose Escalation Phase and a Dose Expansion Phase. TBX-3400 will be administered on Day 1 of each treatment cycle and can be repeated.&#xD;
In the Dose Escalation Phase, a &quot;3+3&quot; design will be employed. Each dose cohort will initially enroll 3 patients. Enrollment and treatment of the first 3 patients in the first cohort will be staggered to allow for evaluation of safety. After each cohort has been enrolled and all patients in the cohort have completed Cycle 1, a Data Safety Monitoring Committee will review cumulative safety data to determine whether to proceed with further dose escalation.&#xD;
Each cohort may be expanded in groups of 3 patients to a maximum of 12 patients. Up to six TBX 3400 dose levels will be evaluated during the Dose Escalation Phase of the study.</intervention_model_description>
