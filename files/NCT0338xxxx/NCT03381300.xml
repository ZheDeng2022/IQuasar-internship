      Rationale: Infertility due is a major concern for girls with Turner syndrome (TS) and their&#xD;
      parents. Physicians are often asked about possible options to preserve their fertility.&#xD;
      However, despite some experimental case reports, clear evidence for fertility preservation in&#xD;
      these girls is lacking and many questions remain. Without evidence on the effectiveness of&#xD;
      fertility preservation it cannot routinely be offered to girls with TS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To investigate the occurrence of live birth in women with TS after ovarian tissue&#xD;
      cryopreservation in childhood followed by auto transplantation in adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A national multicentre exploratory intervention study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Girls diagnosed with Turner Syndrome, aged 2-18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Ovarian tissue cryopreservation in childhood followed by auto transplantation&#xD;
      in adulthood. In order to obtain the ovarian tissue for cryopreservation, all girls must&#xD;
      undergo a laparoscopy under general anaesthesia which will be performed in&#xD;
      academic/university clinics with paediatric surgery. During the laparoscopic intervention, a&#xD;
      unilateral oophorectomy will be performed, thereby leaving the other ovary intact for hormone&#xD;
      production, ovulation, spontaneous pregnancies and as an auto transplantation site for&#xD;
      cryopreserved-thawed ovarian cortical tissue later on. Furthermore, a small sample of the&#xD;
      ovarian cortex will be used to assess the oocyte quality and genetics (e.g. the presence of&#xD;
      germ line mosaicism). Oocytes will be karyotyped by using Fluorescence in situ hybridization&#xD;
      (FISH). Karyotypic and hormonal data will be collected once at the yearly clinical visit at&#xD;
      the paediatric-endocrinologist. Therefore, a buccal swab and one extra blood sample will be&#xD;
      taken and evaluated during the routine laboratory evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the future, auto transplantation of frozen-thawed ovarian cortex strips will be performed.&#xD;

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective remains to preserve the fertility of the respective (minor) patient,&#xD;
      facing a very high risk of premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) of 95-98%. Disadvantages of&#xD;
      participating in this study are the potential risk of complications related to the&#xD;
      laparoscopic unilateral oophorectomy and/or the unknown effect on future fertility of these&#xD;
      girls. Moreover, the procedure might raise false hope in patients (and/or parents) about the&#xD;
      chance of getting pregnant after auto transplantation of cryopreserved-thawed ovarian tissue&#xD;
      in the future. However, we attempt to overcome this by extensive and objective information&#xD;
      provision by both written materials and face to face counselling.&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        In order to be eligible to participate in this study, a subject must meet all of the&#xD;
        following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Girls and young females with classic Turner (i.e. 45X monosomy) or Turner variants&#xD;
             (e.g. 45X / 46XX mosaicism, ring X mosaicism, isochromosome X),&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aged 2 through 18 years,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  who completed the diagnostic work up phase of TS including routine cardiac screening*,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  whose agreement to participate in this study has been signed by the parents (girls&#xD;
             2-11 years old),&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  whose agreement to participate in this study has been signed by the patient and her&#xD;
             parents (girls 12-17 years old),&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  whose agreement to participate in this study has been signed by the patient&#xD;
             (adolescents of 18 years old).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A potential subject who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from&#xD;
        participation in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contra-indications for laparoscopic unilateral oophorectomy under general anaesthesia&#xD;
             (e.g. severe cardiovascular comorbidity and/or BMI &gt;40 kg/m2)*,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contra-indications for cryopreservation (i.e. active HIV, hepatitis-B or hepatitis-C&#xD;
             infection)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Based on the international Cincinnati Turner Guideline consensus Meeting, July&#xD;
                  2016 and consultation of Dutch cardiologists, paediatric-cardiologists and&#xD;
                  anaesthesists between 2016-2017 there are no absolute cardiovascular&#xD;
                  contra-indications for surgical intervention and/or pregnancy. Advice against&#xD;
                  surgical intervention and/or pregnancy should be based on the patient-specific&#xD;
                  cardiovascular risk profile. The 2% mortality risk due to acute aortic dissection&#xD;
                  is based on one survey and literature review study that reported the outcomes of&#xD;
                  101 pregnancies in patients with TS after oocyte donation. Only 50% of the&#xD;
                  patients were screened by a cardiologist before entering the oocyte donation&#xD;
                  programme. Therefore, all girls who want to participate in this study should have&#xD;
                  completed the diagnostic work up phase of TS including routine cardiac screening&#xD;
                  and will be screened by a paediatric anaesthesist. Exclusion will be based on the&#xD;
                  patient specific risk profile. See: References.&#xD;
