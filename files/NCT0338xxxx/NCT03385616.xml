      Feasibility trial (FIH) to assess the safety and clinical utility in patients with chronic&#xD;
      bronchitis in Canada.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Gala Airway Treatment system is a device-based, energy delivery system that delivers high&#xD;
      frequency short duration energy to the airway epithelium and sub-mucosal tissue layers. The&#xD;
      energy is delivered via a proprietary catheter through the bronchoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two sessions of treatment will be delivered one month apart. The right lung is treated at the&#xD;
      first treatment session and the left lung is treated at the second treatment session&#xD;
      (approximately one month after the right side is treated). Treatment will be delivered by a&#xD;
      respiratory physician (interventional pulmonologist) in a tertiary teaching hospital during a&#xD;
      bronchoscopic procedure. The bronchoscopy will be delivered during general anaesthesia. It is&#xD;
      anticipated that the bronchoscopic procedure will last less than 60 minutes in total.&#xD;
      Treatment will be deemed to have been delivered following the successful treatment during the&#xD;
      two bronchoscopies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A third bronchoscopy will be performed three months following the second treatment session&#xD;
      where treatment is not delivered but a cryo-biopsy will be taken from the airway sites that&#xD;
      have been treated during the two previous bronchoscopic treatment session to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of the treatment on the airways producing excessive mucous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be required to submit to several tests during the study including two CT scans&#xD;
      (lung), respiratory function tests, exercise testing.&#xD;
