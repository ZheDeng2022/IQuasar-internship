  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      APG-1252 is a highly potent Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor, a promising drug candidate which&#xD;
      shown high binding affinities to Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Bcl-w. The preclinical studies have shown&#xD;
      that APG-1252 alone achieves complete and persistent tumor regression in multiple tumor&#xD;
      xenograft models with a twice weekly or weekly dose-schedule, including SCLC, colon, breast&#xD;
      and ALL cancer xenografts; achieves strong synergy with the chemotherapeutic agents,&#xD;
      indicating that APG-1252 may have a broad therapeutic potential for the treatment of human&#xD;
      cancer as a single agent and in combination with other classes of anticancer drugs. APG-1252&#xD;
      is intended for the treatment of patients with SCLC or other solid tumors. Upon completion of&#xD;
      the Phase 1 dose escalation study to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD),&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), several phase Ib/II&#xD;
      studies will be implemented accordingly.&#xD;
