  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to assess whether the intracranial pressure (ICP) can be&#xD;
      detected by using a non-invasive retinal fundus scanner, recording the vessels of the eye&#xD;
      entering from the optic disc. The artery's diameter (A) is measured and compared to the&#xD;
      vein's diameter (V) thereby a ratio A/V can be calculated. This ratio is compared to the&#xD;
      values obtained from conventional fiberoptic intraparenchymal, intraventricular ICP&#xD;
      monitoring using external ventricular drain (EVD) or lumbar pressure monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Valid non-invasive techniques for objective measurements of the intracranial pressure do not&#xD;
      exist at the given time now and this study could prove to help the development of monitoring&#xD;
      patients ICP without surgical intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intracranial pressure (ICP) is based on the simple principle of Monroe-Kellie Doctrine. Since&#xD;
      the volume of the cranial cavity is constant and the brain, CSF and blood can only compensate&#xD;
      for a certain change in volume, pressure will increase at a critical increase in volume. An&#xD;
      increase in pressure caused by an increase in intracranial volume is distributed throughout&#xD;
      the entire brain and spinal canal equally. The normal range of ICP varies with age. Normal&#xD;
      values are less than 10-15 mmHg for adults and adolescents, 3-7 mmHg for younger children and&#xD;
      1.5-6 mmHg for newborns even sub-atmospheric ICP has been shown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The threshold for intracranial hypertension varies in the literature, which is reflected in&#xD;
      the clinical use. Generally, ICP above 20 mmHg is defined intracranial hypertension. ICP&#xD;
      higher than 20-25 may require treatment, and continuous ICP above 40 mmHg indicates severe,&#xD;
      lethal intracranial hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some forms of measurements, e.g. 1. Intraparenchymal strain gauge or fiber optics or 2.&#xD;
      Intraventricular ICP monitoring via external ventricular drain (EVD). EVD is considered&#xD;
      golden standard, but in the daily clinic there is often no or limited difference between 1.&#xD;
      and 2. The issue regarding invasive methods are the same as for any surgical procedure, e.g.&#xD;
      bleeding and infection. Risk of bleeding is 2-10% for EVD and 2.5% for intraparenchymal&#xD;
      monitors. The consequences of such a bleed can be severe and result in disability. EVD has a&#xD;
      higher risk of infection (5-20%) compared to intraparenchymal monitors (0-0.1%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-invasive methods such as transcranial doppler ultrasound pulsation index and optic nerve&#xD;
      sheath diameter has been used in studies, which seemed promising, but has not yet been&#xD;
      validated for routine clinical use. Also, in non-invasive methods there are significant inter&#xD;
      observational variation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies of the eye's fundus have shown a correlation between ICP and ratio between artery and&#xD;
      vein diameter (A/V ratio, unpublished data) Currently, there are no published work that has&#xD;
      considered the correlation between A/V ratio and ICP, however there is a study with a&#xD;
      theoretical prediction of such a correlation (Babbs CF 2016. Weldon School of Biomedical&#xD;
      Engineering Faculty Working Papers. Paper 1 http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/bmewp/1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study investigates the correlation between non-invasive fundus ICP estimation and&#xD;
      intracranial pressure monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In practice, all conscious and able adults admitted to Odense University Hospital for&#xD;
      intracranial pressure monitoring/measurements by either an EVD, intraparenchymal ICP monitor&#xD;
      or lumbar spinal fluid pressure assessment are enrolled.&#xD;
