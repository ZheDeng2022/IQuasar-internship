      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of intrathecal&#xD;
      administration of onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi in infants and children with Spinal Muscular&#xD;
      Atrophy with 3 copies of SMN2 and deletion of SMN1.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, single-dose administration study of infants and children with a genetic&#xD;
      diagnosis consistent with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), bi-allelic deletion of survival&#xD;
      motor neuron 1 gene (SMN1) and 3 copies of survival motor neuron 2 gene (SMN2) without the&#xD;
      genetic modifier who are able to sit but cannot stand or walk at the time of study entry.&#xD;
      Patients will receive onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi in a dose comparison safety study of two&#xD;
      (or three) potential therapeutic doses. Patients will be stratified in two groups, those ≥6&#xD;
      months and &lt; 24 months of age at time of dosing and those ≥ 24 months and &lt; 60 months of age&#xD;
      at time of dosing. At least 15 patients ≥ 6 months and &lt; 24 months, and at least 12 patients&#xD;
      ≥ 24 &lt; 60 months will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first cohort will enroll three patients (Cohort 1) ≥ 6 months and &lt; 24 months of age who&#xD;
      will receive administration of 6.0 × 1013 vg of onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi (Dose A). There&#xD;
      will be at least a four week interval between the dosing of each patient within the cohort.&#xD;
      Novartis Gene Therapies, Inc. will confer with the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) on all&#xD;
      Grade III or higher AEs within approximately 48 hours of awareness that are possibly,&#xD;
      probably or definitely related to the study agent before continuing enrollment. Safety data&#xD;
      will be reviewed by the DSMB during quarterly meetings; following enrollment of the three&#xD;
      patients and based upon the available safety data a decision will be made whether to: a) stop&#xD;
      due to toxicity, or b) proceed to Cohort 2 using Dose B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should the determination be made to advance to Dose B, three patients &lt; 60 months of age will&#xD;
      be enrolled (Cohort 2) and will receive administration of 1.2 × 1014 vg of onasemnogene&#xD;
      abeparvovec-xioi (Dose B). Again, there will be at least a four-week interval between dosing&#xD;
      of the three patients within the cohort. Based on the available safety data from the three&#xD;
      Cohort 2 patients and all of the Cohort 1 patients, the DSMB will decide and document during&#xD;
      quarterly meetings whether further four-week intervals between patients dosing is necessary.&#xD;
      Novartis Gene Therapies, Inc. will take this recommendation into consideration and will make&#xD;
      the final determination whether to persist with four-week intervals between patients dosing&#xD;
      going forward; the decision will be communicated to sites and Institutional Review Boards&#xD;
      (IRBs) in a formal sponsor letter. Novartis Gene Therapies, Inc. will confer with the DSMB on&#xD;
      all Grade III or higher AEs within approximately 48 hours of awareness that are possibly,&#xD;
      probably or definitely related to the study agent before continuing enrollment. Safety data&#xD;
      will be reviewed by the DSMB during quarterly meetings; following enrollment of the first six&#xD;
      patients and based upon available safety data, a decision will be made whether to: a) stop&#xD;
      due to toxicity, or b) continue to enroll an additional 21 patients until there are a total&#xD;
      of 12 patients &gt; 6 months and &lt; 24 months and 12 patients ≥ 24 and &lt; 60 months that have all&#xD;
      received Dose B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based upon an ongoing assessment of safety and efficacy data from patients treated with the&#xD;
      1.2 × 1014 vg dose, an option for testing of a third dose (Dose C), will be considered. If,&#xD;
      based on all available data, this is judged to be safe and necessary, three patients &lt; 60&#xD;
      months of age will receive Dose C, 2.4 × 1014 vg administered IT. A meeting of the DSMB will&#xD;
      be called to obtain a recommendation on the safety of escalating to a higher dose prior to&#xD;
      proceeding. If a decision is made to proceed to testing a higher dose, there will again be a&#xD;
      four-week interval between dosing of the first three patients receiving Dose C, as in Cohorts&#xD;
      1 and 2. Safety data will be reviewed by the DSMB during quarterly meetings. Following&#xD;
      enrollment of the first three Dose C patients and based upon available safety data, the DSMB&#xD;
      will be consulted and a decision will be made whether to: a) stop dosing Dose C due to safety&#xD;
      concerns, or b) continue to enroll an additional 21 patients until there are a total of 12&#xD;
      patients &gt; 6 months and &lt; 24 months and 12 patients ≥ 24 and &lt; 60 months that have received&#xD;
      Dose C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients from Cohort 3 will be followed for a total of 15 months post-dose. The primary&#xD;
      analyses for efficacy will be assessed when all patients reach 12 months post-dose and the&#xD;
      primary analyses for safety will be assessed when the last patient of Cohort 3 reaches 15&#xD;
      months post-dose (and database lock will be performed after the last patient reaches 15&#xD;
      months post-dose).&#xD;
