  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prolonged grief disorder (PGD) is a novel diagnostic entity proposed to describe a&#xD;
      psychiatric disorder that occurs after the loss of a loved one. The disorder is to be&#xD;
      implemented in The International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11), scheduled&#xD;
      for release in 2018. Failure to recognize and treat PGD may have negative effects on health,&#xD;
      functional capacity and quality of life. However, very little is known about the&#xD;
      characteristics and treatment of PGD in adult Danish populations although such knowledge is&#xD;
      much needed before introducing the disorder in Danish health services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aims to develop, test and disseminate a group-based treatment manual for&#xD;
      PGD in bereaved partners and their adult children. People with high levels of symptoms will&#xD;
      be recruited from a large-scale survey study examining frequency, predictors and prognosis of&#xD;
      PGD symptoms (NCT03049007). Participants will be randomized to group-based compassion-focused&#xD;
      therapy (CFT) for grief or a waitlist control group. Treatment effects will be estimated with&#xD;
      prolonged grief symptoms as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include depressive&#xD;
      symptoms, posttraumatic stress symptoms, symptoms of anxiety, and quality-of-life. The&#xD;
      investigators expect that CFT will yield statistically significant effects on prolonged grief&#xD;
      symptom compared with the waitlist control group. If CFT is shown to be efficacious in&#xD;
      reducing prolonged grief symptoms, the investigators will conduct moderation and mediation&#xD;
      analyses with the aim of identifying what works, for whom. Finally, the investigators will&#xD;
      perform cost-effectiveness analyses by linking the data with healthcare utilization data from&#xD;
      the Danish National registries.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • CFT will have a statistically significant and long-term effect on PGD symptoms compared&#xD;
      with the waitlist control group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-compassion self-criticism, rumination, and exposure to the loss will mediate the&#xD;
           effects of CFT on PGD symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline PGD symptom level will moderate the intervention effects of CFT, with higher&#xD;
           symptom level predicting larger symptom improvement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gender, age, type of loss, attachment style, neuroticism, positive affect and social&#xD;
           support will predict who will benefit most from treatment (moderator analyses)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CFT will reduce levels of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress symptoms and&#xD;
           increase quality-of-life (QoL) compared with the wait-list control group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time spent on homework practice will moderate the intervention effects of CFT, with more&#xD;
           time spent on homework predicting larger symptom improvement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CFT is a cost-effective psychological treatment compared with the waitlist-control group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present project will be conducted as a randomized waitlist-controlled trial, with a 1:1&#xD;
      allocation ratio and using block randomization conducted by an external biostatistician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present randomized controlled trial (RCT) recruits patients from a large survey that&#xD;
      invites all bereaved partners in the Central Denmark Region and their adult children (age &gt;&#xD;
      18 years) to participate in a survey regarding trajectories of grief. This means that the&#xD;
      present study recruits patients from an existing survey (NCT03049007). All bereaved partners&#xD;
      and their adult children from the existing survey study with clinically relevant levels of&#xD;
      PGD 11 months after their loss (min.score &gt;= 25 on PG-13) will be invited to participate in&#xD;
      the present RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment points&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of all three intervention groups will be provided at five points: (1) before the&#xD;
      intervention (baseline), (2) after each session (the CFT group only), (3) after the last&#xD;
      intervention session (post-intervention), (4) 3 months post-intervention, and (5) 6 months&#xD;
      post-intervention. In addition, data on healthcare utilization will be retrieved from the&#xD;
      Danish registries concerning health care services (e.g., visit to the general practitioner,&#xD;
      use of medication, number of hospitalizations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have generally found large effects of psychological interventions for PGD&#xD;
      that included cognitive techniques with effect-sizes (Cohens' d) ranging from 0.80-2.41.&#xD;
      Although previous studies testing the efficacy of psychological treatments for prolonged&#xD;
      grief have reported large effects, we undertake a more conservative estimate as CFT, so far,&#xD;
      has not been tested in a bereaved population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, no values for minimal clinically important difference (MCID) have been established&#xD;
      for the PG-13. When such indicators are missing, the general literature on interpretation of&#xD;
      clinical change suggests that a change corresponding to one half standard deviation could be&#xD;
      a suitable substitute (Copay et al., 2007; Norman et al. 2003). We therefore aim to be able&#xD;
      to detect a clinically relevant effect of Cohen's d 0.50. A final sample of 156 participants&#xD;
      (2 x 78, 1:1 allocation) will enable us, in a pre-post repeated-measures design, to detect a&#xD;
      difference between CFT and the control group, with a two-sided alpha of 0.05, a pre-post&#xD;
      correlation (Rho) of 0.5, a statistical power of 0.80, and an estimated dropout rate of 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses will be conducted using the statistical software IBM SPSS statistics, v.21 (IMB,&#xD;
      Chicago, IL) and Stata v.13 (StataCorp, College Stadium, TX). Baseline group differences will&#xD;
      be explored with t tests and χ²-tests. All main effects will be analyzed using Mixed Linear&#xD;
      Models (MLMs) based on the intent-to-treat sample, comparing groups over time on all outcome&#xD;
      variables. Each hypothesis will be tested in separate models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention effects will be indicated by a statistically significant 2-way group x time&#xD;
      interaction, and results will be interpreted in terms of their effect sizes. As we randomize&#xD;
      the participants, we do not expect that any differences in use of alternative treatments&#xD;
      prior to or during the study period will exist between study groups. However, in case of an&#xD;
      imbalance on this variable, we will include it as a covariate in a second set of analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible mediating and moderating effects will be explored for statistically significant&#xD;
      outcomes in the main analyses, using MLMs. Cost-effectiveness analyses will be investigated&#xD;
      by aggregating healthcare utilization costs and by investigating the effect of CFT on&#xD;
      Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALY).The probability of CFT being cost-effective are&#xD;
      investigated by calculating Cost-Effectiveness Acceptability Curves (CEACs).&#xD;

    <description>CFT for PGD symptoms in the present project is inspired by two well-established CFT treatment manuals. The first is used for treatment of PTSD (Lee &amp; James, 2011) and the other for treatment of anger (Kolt, 2011). The manual for CFT for PGD adopts both structure and techniques from these into an 8-week, group-based program with weekly 2 1/4-hour sessions. Each session contains elements of psychoeducation on uncomplicated and prolonged grief reactions, identifying unhelpful strategies for self-protection and facilitating use of more helpful strategies, and training an open and compassionate management of grief-related distress through CFT exercises. Between the sessions the participant will train the exercises introduced at the previous session.</description>
