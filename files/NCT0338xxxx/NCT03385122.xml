      Environmental factors constitute an important but underappreciated risk factor towards the&#xD;
      development and progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Environmental exposure in&#xD;
      variable pollutants is implicated in the derangement or propagation of adverse&#xD;
      pathophysiological processes linked with atherosclerosis, including genetic, hemodynamic,&#xD;
      metabolic, oxidative and inflammation parameters. However no data exists concerning&#xD;
      environmental pollution in rural or semi-rural areas. Therefore the purpose of the&#xD;
      &quot;Corinthia&quot; study is to examine the impact of environmental pollution in indices of&#xD;
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in a cross-sectional and longitudinal design.&#xD;
      Corinthia study began in October 2015 and is planned to recruit 2400 individuals from&#xD;
      different regions of Corinthia country with different environmental exposure to pollutants&#xD;
      and different patterns of soil-ground and/or air pollution until September 2018. Baseline&#xD;
      measurements will include lifestyle measurements, anthropometric characteristics and a&#xD;
      comprehensive cardiovascular examination. The follow-up is planned to extent, prospectively,&#xD;
      up to 10 years and this study is anticipated to provide valuable data on the distinct impact&#xD;
      of soil and air pollution in early markers of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease and&#xD;
      in the overall impact of environment pollution to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite major advances in cardiovascular (CV) medicine during the last decades, deaths and&#xD;
      morbidity from cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are increasing globally [1, 2]. It seems that&#xD;
      population aging and population growth balances out the decline in age-specific death rates&#xD;
      from CVD that could be attributed to more effective prevention and treatment strategies [2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, the progress in confronting CVD is evident around the world but notably&#xD;
      heterogeneous. Regions with the fastest growing population dynamics experienced relative&#xD;
      increase in CV deaths in line with global trends. In contrast, developed regions reported no&#xD;
      detectable change or little decrease in CV mortality as rapid aging of the population offsets&#xD;
      the declines in age-specific death rates [3]. Residual CV risk beyond traditional risk&#xD;
      factors should be reassessed and further explored in the quest of new underlying mechanisms&#xD;
      that could provide the substrate for innovative preventive interventions and therapeutic&#xD;
      goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under this prism, environmental factors constitute an important but underappreciated risk&#xD;
      factor towards the development and progression of CVD [4]. Environmental exposure in variable&#xD;
      pollutants is implicated in the derangement or propagation of adverse pathophysiological&#xD;
      processes linked with atherosclerosis, including genetic, hemodynamic, metabolic, oxidative&#xD;
      and inflammation parameters [4]. Recent studies suggest that chronic environmental stress is&#xD;
      an important determinant of CVD risk, even below current regulatory standards for exposure&#xD;
      levels [4, 5].&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most important studies in the field of environmental cardiology, the Multi-Ethnic&#xD;
      Study of Atherosclerosis and Air Pollution (MESA Air) investigated the association between&#xD;
      long-term air pollution exposure and the progression of subclinical atherosclerosis and the&#xD;
      incidence of CVD at an urban dwelling population [6]. However no data exists concerning&#xD;
      environmental pollution in rural or semi-rural areas. Therefore the purpose of the&#xD;
      &quot;Corinthia&quot; study is to examine the impact of environmental pollution in indices of CV&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality in a cross-sectional and longitudinal design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rational of the study National-based data for Greece concerning environment pollution and CVD&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality are markedly scarce. Research activity has focused on soil and&#xD;
      groundwater anthropogenic contamination in river basin of heavy polluted industrialized areas&#xD;
      but without reporting associations with CVD [7]. Moreover, certain prospective or&#xD;
      retrospective studies have examined the association of long-term exposure to air pollution&#xD;
      with CVD morbidity in urban population [8, 9]. The region of Corinth has rural or semi-rural&#xD;
      areas with high exposure to soil and air contamination in distinct territories-patterns. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesized that long term exposure to environmental pollutants mediates&#xD;
      detrimental epigenetic, oxidative, inflammatory and pro-atherogenic effects that could&#xD;
      accelerate the progress and the severity of CVD as well as the quality of life and the&#xD;
      overall morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the investigators sought to investigate in a&#xD;
      cross sectional and longitudinal design the impact of different type of environmental&#xD;
      pollution in indices of subclinical atherosclerosis, on rates of CV morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      and on CVD risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis of the study I. The primary hypothesis of the study is that individual exposed to&#xD;
      different environmental pollutants have increased rate of all-cause mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. The secondary hypothesis of the study is that individuals exposed to different&#xD;
      environmental pollutants have increased rate of CV mortality and increased incidence of&#xD;
      non-fatal CVD (i.e. acute coronary syndromes, peripheral aortic disease, cerebrovascular&#xD;
      disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Additional hypothesis of the study is that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Individuals exposed to different environmental pollutants present an adverse&#xD;
           cardiometabolic profile in terms of surrogate markers of early atherosclerosis and&#xD;
           oxidative stress&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Environmental pollution affects adversely the quality of life in exposed subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Environmental pollution confers epigenetic alterations (telomere shortening, microRNAs&#xD;
           mobilization and circulation) in subjects exposed to different pollutants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental details and design of the Corinthia study The present study began at October&#xD;
      2015 and is planned to recruit 1500 individuals from different regions of Corinth with&#xD;
      different environmental exposure to pollutants and different patterns of soil-ground and/or&#xD;
      air pollution until December 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to recruit individuals living in three different areas according to&#xD;
      environmental pollution (Figure 1):&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Subjects living in areas with no evidence of soil/ground or air pollution ii. Subjects&#xD;
      living in areas with air pollution iii. Subjects living in areas with soil/ground pollution&#xD;
      Residents of the selected regions who are not planning to move within the next 10 years will&#xD;
      be approached. An acceptance rate of participation of approximately 80% of those eligible&#xD;
      subjects is anticipated. Exclusion criteria for the study would be&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Inability and unwillingness to obtain informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Individuals less than 40 years of age The recruitment into Corinthia study will be&#xD;
           community-based, with an emphasis on balancing recruitment across the three areas,&#xD;
           census blocks, age categories (per decades) and gender. The sampling frame will&#xD;
           implement information from the latest national Census and will proceed along geographic&#xD;
           boundaries. As sampling unit we will use each household, with a goal of including no&#xD;
           more than 2 eligible participants from different households per census block. Initial&#xD;
           contact will be performed by telephone or door-to-door. Telephone recruitment will be&#xD;
           based on a list built from the specified geographic boundaries. Initial contact included&#xD;
           a screening questionnaire and household enumeration of all eligible persons. The&#xD;
           recruitment goal is 500 participants from each of the three areas of interest. During&#xD;
           this period the research team will communicate with the local authorities and with&#xD;
           health services in the areas of research in order to organize the volunteering selection&#xD;
           of the participants in each area. Responsibility of the research team is also the&#xD;
           organization of the places where field research will take place. Pilot measurements will&#xD;
           take place and accordingly the research team will estimate the validity of the tests,&#xD;
           and will calculate variability coefficients of the tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 24 months will be devoted to recruitment (October 2015- September 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality Control and repeatability of measures The research fellow recruited for the study&#xD;
      will perform all vascular and anthropometric measurements. The research fellow will undergo a&#xD;
      2 month training and accreditation for these measurements. Echocardiographic measurements&#xD;
      will be performed by the same trained cardiac physiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Measurements Baseline measurements for participants in the &quot;Corinthia&quot; Study will&#xD;
      include parameters affecting the everyday lifestyle such as smoking habits, physical activity&#xD;
      and diet. Anthropometric (height, weight, waist circumference) socio-economic and lifestyle&#xD;
      characteristics (marital status, educational level, economic and professional status), as&#xD;
      well as, family history and history of cardiovascular risk factors and diseases will be&#xD;
      recorded. The investigators also planning to identify the psychological state of individuals&#xD;
      (using a valid Depression Scale ZUNG) and participants mental status (MMSE-Mini Mental State&#xD;
      Examination). We will record the presence and the treatment in use, if any, of hypertension,&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia. Subjects will be submitted to a full cardiac&#xD;
      examination, including physical examination, electrocardiography, echocardiography&#xD;
      (Evaluation of left ventricle ejection fraction, of left ventricle dimensions, evaluation of&#xD;
      valvular function, of transmittal flow pattern, of right ventricle systolic pressure, of&#xD;
      aortic distensibility etc.), blood pressure measurements, arterial wall properties&#xD;
      measurement with non-invasive estimation of pulse wave velocity and estimation of&#xD;
      atherosclerotic burden with evaluation of carotid intima media thickens and of&#xD;
      atherosclerotic plaques in carotid arteries. Peripheral blood samples will be gathered for&#xD;
      DNA analysis, routine biochemical tests and measurement of inflammatory markers and markers&#xD;
      of oxidative stress. Subsequent examinations, which will include repetitions of certain&#xD;
      baseline measurements as well as new measures, will be scheduled at approximately adjacent&#xD;
      2-year intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of regions-Environmental measurements Data on soil/ground contamination with&#xD;
      pollutants (pesticides, fertilizers etc) and of air pollution from industrial gasses and&#xD;
      exposures will be provided from records and measurements of the Faculty of Geology and&#xD;
      Geoenvironment and the faculty of Environmental Physics of the National and Kapodistrian&#xD;
      University of Athens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up The study investigators will prospectively perform the 5 and 10-year follow-up&#xD;
      about participants': (a) Vital status (death from any cause or due to CVD), (b) development&#xD;
      of coronary heart disease (CHD) (i.e., myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, other&#xD;
      identified forms of ischemia, heart failure of different types, and chronic arrhythmias) and&#xD;
      (c) development of cerebrovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With an anticipated loss to follow-up of approximately~15% [10] the ten year follow up data&#xD;
      are expected to decipher the effect of long term exposure to pollution on overall and&#xD;
      cardiovascular mortality and morbidity as well as on interim endpoints of surrogate markers&#xD;
      of subclinical atherosclerosis. Respectively, with a type I error predefined to 0.05 and all&#xD;
      considered to be 2-tailed, a sample size of 1500 subjects would yield adequate power (&gt;80%)&#xD;
      to detect a 1.5- fold change in Hazzard ratio per area-group change in the aforementioned&#xD;
      index variable towards the secondary endpoint (all-cause mortality) taking into account an&#xD;
      event rate of 6%, a follow up period of minimum 60 months and an anticipated loss to follow&#xD;
      up of less than 15%. Type I error was predefined at 0.05 and all tests were considered to be&#xD;
      2-tailed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion The Corinthia study is an epidemiological study of Environmental importance with a&#xD;
      cross-sectional and prospective longitudinal design planning to provide data on the distinct&#xD;
      impact of soil and air pollution in indices of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and in&#xD;
      the overall health status of a rural or semi-rural population of the Greek country.&#xD;
