      Trial Subjects (patients), will receive single infusions of pembrolizumab every 3 weeks until&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity develops. They will receive radiotherapy at week&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Trial Subjects (patients) who are deemed eligible for the trial will be administered a single&#xD;
      infusion of pembrolizumab (200mg) every 3 weeks. At week 12, patients will be planned to&#xD;
      start radiotherapy at a dose of 12 Gray (Gy) in 3 fractions which will be given concomitantly&#xD;
      with pembrolizumab. Patients who progress on pembrolizumab before week 12 will start&#xD;
      radiotherapy as soon as possible after progression. Following completion of radiotherapy,&#xD;
      patients will continue receiving pembrolizumab at 3 weekly intervals for a maximum of 2 years&#xD;
      until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity develops. Patients on pembrolizumab will&#xD;
      be seen every 3 weeks until 2 years after study entry, while Patients who progressed/ stopped&#xD;
      pembrolizumab will be seen annually for survival/disease status only. Patients completing 2&#xD;
      years of treatment will then be followed up annually for survival and disease status until&#xD;
      the end of trial is declared (2 years after the last patient is registered).&#xD;
