    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test the effects of intradural, spinal cord stimulation using&#xD;
      a device placed in the same manner as a lumbar drain performed during a standard epidural&#xD;
      spinal cord stimulation (SCS) trial routinely performed prior permanent lead and stimulation&#xD;
      device implantation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot study the investigators will test an ability of intradural electrical&#xD;
      stimulation in humans to elicit physiological responses (paresthesia or tingling sensation)&#xD;
      and decrease pain when placed in the region of the thoracic spinal cord in a controlled&#xD;
      manner. This subject population is comprised of patients that had previously failed various&#xD;
      conservative pain management treatment plans and are deemed candidates for treatment of pain&#xD;
      by spinal cord stimulation. The investigators will use commercially available device to&#xD;
      deliver an intradural electrical stimulation to the spinal cord. This device is FDA approved&#xD;
      for intracranial electrophysiological monitoring and delivery of electrical stimulation of&#xD;
      the subsurface level of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a part of the study, the subject will be offered to complete the following questionnaires&#xD;
      to assess quality of life and global function. These questionnaires will be completed prior&#xD;
      the procedure and at specified time periods following the research intervention. The&#xD;
      experimental portion of the procedure will follow the standard epidural spinal cord&#xD;
      stimulator testing. Under fluoroscopic guidance, using a paramedian approach and shallow&#xD;
      entry angle, the device will be placed percutaneously at the lumbar spine at L2-3 or L3-4&#xD;
      level into the intrathecal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) space and advanced to the T8-10 disc&#xD;
      space. The stimulation catheter will run through a standardized experimental algorithm&#xD;
      further described in greater details. The initial stimulation will last approximately 30&#xD;
      minutes and involve testing for paresthesias (tingling) and measurement of the threshold&#xD;
      signal strength for onset of this sensation at 60 hertz (Hz) and 10000 Hz frequences. During&#xD;
      this portion the subject will be asked to describe the sensations and rate his or her pain on&#xD;
      a 0 to 10 scale. Following this initial stimulation, the frequency will be changed to 10&#xD;
      kilohertz (KHz) to run over the period of 4 hours. The investigators will continue evaluating&#xD;
      the effects of stimulation using visual analogue scores during this period of time.&#xD;
