  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SAFIR PI3K is an open-label multicenter phase II randomized trial, comparing alpelisib plus&#xD;
      fulvestrant to maintenance chemotherapy in patient PIK3CA mutated with HR+/Her2- metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer who do not present progressive disease after 6-8 cycles of 1st or second line&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine whether treatment with alpelisib plus fulvestrant&#xD;
      prolongs progression-free survival (PFS) compared to maintenance chemotherapy in patients&#xD;
      PIK3CA mutated with hormone receptor positive (HR+), HER2-negative advanced breast cancer,&#xD;
      who do not present a progressive disease after 6-8 cycles of chemotherapy.&#xD;

Premenopausal women will receive luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) analogs in addition every 28 days ± 3 days.&#xD;
OR&#xD;
• Control arm (Arm B3): maintenance chemotherapy, meaning the same chemotherapy regimen used during the first 6-8 cycles (investigator's choice) or no antineoplastic treatment in case of toxicity after 4 full cycles.&#xD;
