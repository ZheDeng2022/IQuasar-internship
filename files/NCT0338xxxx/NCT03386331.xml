  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a six months intervention study in non-diabetic overweight and obese subjects.&#xD;
      Subjects will be counseled for weight loss through diet and exercise. Diet and exercise will&#xD;
      be recommended as per the regular norms for weight loss (weight loss ≥10% from baseline&#xD;
      weight will be considered as a significant loss of weight) for overweight and obese subjects.&#xD;
      A sample size of 90 subjects was calculated but assuming a drop out rate of 20%, 110 subjects&#xD;
      will be enrolled. Enrolled subjects will be measured at every visit (monthly) for weight,&#xD;
      body composition measures of abdominal obesity and skin folds. They would be assessed for&#xD;
      compliance with diet and exercise. Detailed analysis of body composition including DXA,&#xD;
      biochemical analysis will be performed at enrollment and after six months intervention.&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed to find association between measures of body&#xD;
      composition for weight loss and genotypes of the VDR polymorphisms.&#xD;

      VDR Polymorphisms&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polymorphisms in the VDR gene have been identified through out the complete VDR gene region&#xD;
      and associated with cancer and autoimmune diseases. The FokI polymorphism is present in the&#xD;
      translation site and results in the VDR protein being shortened by three amino acids and is&#xD;
      not linked with any other VDR polymorphisms. This polymorphism predisposes to bone-disease,&#xD;
      risk of cancer, immune mediated diseases 147-149,150, 151.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The common VDR gene polymorphisms are BsmI, TaqI, ApaI and FokI. These polymorphisms have&#xD;
      shown varying results with insulin sensitivity and secretion.&#xD;
