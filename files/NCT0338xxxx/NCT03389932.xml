  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today, there are 25 million Americans with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 660,000 patients&#xD;
      in full kidney failure, the final CKD stage, known as end stage renal disease (ESRD). Over&#xD;
      half of ESRD patients are Black, Hispanic, or Asian. ESRD patients must either receive&#xD;
      regular dialysis treatments, by which waste is filtered from the blood by a machine, or a&#xD;
      kidney transplant from a deceased or living donor. Five-year survival on dialysis is only&#xD;
      40%, compared to 74% with a deceased donor kidney transplant (DDKT) and 87% with a living&#xD;
      donor kidney transplant (LDKT). Despite the known health benefits of DDKT and LDKT, 70% of&#xD;
      ESRD patients remain on dialysis, especially ethnic/racial minorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An American Society of Transplantation (AST) Consensus Conference recently recommended that&#xD;
      patients in all CKD stages should have the opportunity to learn about and decide which&#xD;
      treatment option is right for them, particularly about LDKT. However, early education about&#xD;
      LDKT and DDKT is inconsistent and often poor, with early stage CKD patients and ethnic/racial&#xD;
      minorities even less likely to receive it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through previous HRSA grants, Dr. Waterman designed the Explore Transplant@Home (ET@Home)&#xD;
      video-guided education program, and found that it significantly increased LDKT knowledge and&#xD;
      informed decision-making for Black and White dialysis patients in Missouri when delivered by&#xD;
      mail and supported through bimonthly postcards and texting. Now based at the University of&#xD;
      California, Los Angeles (UCLA), she has partnered with Kaiser Permanente Southern California&#xD;
      (KPSC), an integrated learning healthcare system providing insurance coverage and&#xD;
      comprehensive care to 65,000 patients in CKD Stages 3, 4 and 5 (ESRD) (24% Hispanic, 52%&#xD;
      White, 15% Black, and 9% Asian; 10% Spanish-speaking).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Today, there are 25 million Americans with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are at risk for&#xD;
      kidney failure and 660,000 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). To sustain life,&#xD;
      ESRD patients, among whom 31% are Black, 15% are Hispanic, and 5% are Asian, must either&#xD;
      receive daily or weekly dialysis treatments, by which waste is filtered from the blood by a&#xD;
      machine, or receive a kidney transplant from a deceased or living donor. Five-year survival&#xD;
      for patients on dialysis is only 40%, compared to 74% for patients who receive a deceased&#xD;
      donor kidney transplant (DDKT) and 87% for patients who receive a living donor kidney&#xD;
      transplant (LDKT)1. Patients who receive kidney transplants live 5-15 years longer than if&#xD;
      they remained on dialysis, and have a better health-related quality of life (HRQOL),&#xD;
      including a greater likelihood of being in the workforce during their critical earning&#xD;
      years2. While LDKT is the medically optimal and most cost effective renal replacement therapy&#xD;
      (RRT) for patients with ESRD, LDKT rates have declined by 17% from 2004-2014. In 2014, in the&#xD;
      U.S., 17,106 patients received a transplant (5,536 LDKTs) while 8,021 patients also died or&#xD;
      became too ill to remain on the list, 70% of whom were racial/ethnic minorities. Of the 2,039&#xD;
      transplants performed in California in 2014, only 595 were from living donors (OPTN data as&#xD;
      of 12/11/2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since kidneys often fail slowly over months or years, a patient's level of kidney function is&#xD;
      monitored over time as it decreases in nephrologists' offices nationwide. As recommended by a&#xD;
      recent American Society of Transplantation (AST) Consensus Conference, all patients in Stage&#xD;
      3 (Moderate CKD), Stage 4 (Severe CKD), or Stage 5 (End Stage CKD) should receive&#xD;
      comprehensive education about DDKT and LDKT, especially racial/ethnic minorities. Once&#xD;
      patients reach ESRD and begin dialysis, established CKD and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid&#xD;
      Services (CMS) guidelines recommend that dialysis patients be educated about their RRT&#xD;
      options, the medical risks involved, and the advantages to transplant so that they can make&#xD;
      informed RRT decisions4. Since transplants received within the first 6 months of beginning&#xD;
      dialysis result in the best health outcomes,5 one Healthy People 2020 goal is to, &quot;Increase&#xD;
      the proportion of dialysis patients wait-listed and/or receiving a deceased donor kidney&#xD;
      transplant within one year of ESRD start (among patients under 70 years of age).&quot;&#xD;
      Unfortunately, research has shown that many patients in CKD clinics are inconsistently&#xD;
      educated about LDKT, particularly patients who are socioeconomically disadvantaged or members&#xD;
      of racial/ethnic minority groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Without a nationally-coordinated healthcare system, it is extremely difficult to ensure that&#xD;
      kidney patients in Stages 3-5 who are served by different health practitioners and&#xD;
      organizations all learn about DDKT and LDKT and make informed treatment decisions. Providers&#xD;
      also report having limited time to educate about transplant outside of transplant centers and&#xD;
      inadequate educational materials. Thus, disseminating transplant education within a large&#xD;
      health care system, with its fully integrated care management program, diverse membership,&#xD;
      and ability to track a large patient population across the entire course of their kidney&#xD;
      disease, may be an opportune way to educate large numbers of diverse patients about the&#xD;
      opportunities for and risks and benefits of living kidney donation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) is a large, integrated healthcare system&#xD;
      providing coverage and care to over 4 million members throughout Los Angeles, San Diego,Kern,&#xD;
      San Bernardino, Riverside, and Ventura Counties. KPSC provides coverage to nearly 65,000&#xD;
      patients with CKD stages 3-5. About 24% of these patients are Hispanic, 52% White, 15% Black,&#xD;
      and 9% Asian, similar to the broader CKD population in California.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, this team will conduct extensive qualitative and quantitative formative research to&#xD;
      understand and compare the knowledge, informed decisionmaking and educational needs of these&#xD;
      diverse patient groups prior to intervention. Second, they will design a Spanish-language&#xD;
      version of ET@Home. Third, they will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 1,200&#xD;
      Black, Hispanic, Asian, and White patients in CKD Stages 3-5 where patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive: (1) no additional education other than what is provided within KPSC&#xD;
      (standard-of-care); or (2) a video-guided, four-part ET@Home program delivered by mail and&#xD;
      supported through bimonthly postcards and texting over six months. The study aims and&#xD;
      hypotheses are as follows: Aim 1: Using qualitative methodology, to assess the LDKT&#xD;
      educational needs of CKD Stage 3-5 patients and their support networks by race/ethnicity and&#xD;
      primary language spoken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: CKD Stage 3-5 patients and their support networks will have varying needs for&#xD;
      educational content about LDKT based on their race/ethnicity and primary language spoken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Providers will identify important patient needs for LDKT educational content&#xD;
      and opportunities for improvement within the KPSC transplant educational system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Before intervention, to assess differences in knowledge and decision-making about the&#xD;
      opportunities for and risks and benefits of living kidney donation for 1200 CKD Stage 3-5&#xD;
      patients by race/ethnicity and primary language spoken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Patients earlier in the CKD continuum, patients who speak Spanish, and non- White&#xD;
      patients will have less knowledge about the opportunities for and risks and benefits of&#xD;
      living kidney donation and will be making less informed LDKT decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Compared to KPSC education, to conduct a randomized controlled trial in English and&#xD;
      Spanish of ET@Home for CKD Stage 3-5 patients to assess its effectiveness to increase LDKT&#xD;
      knowledge and decision-making by race/ethnicity and primary language spoken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: At the conclusion of the trial, CKD patients who receive ET@Home will have&#xD;
      greater transplant knowledge and be more likely to make an informed treatment decision than&#xD;
      patients receiving KPSC education alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: ET@Home will be more or equally effective for patients earlier in the CKD&#xD;
      continuum, patients who speak Spanish, and non-White patients than patients in these&#xD;
      subgroups receiving KPSC education alone.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Deceased Donor Kidney Transplant (DDKT) and Living Donor Kidney Transplant (DDKT) Knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be asked true/false and multiple choice questions to determine their level of knowledge regarding basic facts, advantages, risks and outcomes of DDKT and LDKT (e.g., &quot;Patients older than 75 years can receive transplants&quot;; &quot;Compared to transplants from donors who have died, how long do transplants from living donors last?&quot;). Scores for this scale are created by summing the number of correct answers given by the patient, creating a theoretical range of 0-25 with higher scores indicating more knowledge.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decisional Balance</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Decisional Balance will be measured for DDKT (DB-DDKT) and for LDKT (DB-LDKT). DB-DDKT, a measure of a patient's perception of the benefits and disadvantages of deceased donor kidney transplant. This measure has been validated in a sample of dialysis patients84. Both measures contain two subscales, Pros and Cons of 6 items, wherein patients rate the importance of a specific Pro or Con to their DDKT or LDKT decision-making (e.g., &quot;I would not have to be on dialysis&quot;) on a Likert-type scale from (1) &quot;Not important&quot; to (5) &quot;Extremely important&quot;. Scores for the subscales will be obtained by summing the patients' responses to the items, implying a theoretical range of 6-30, with higher scores indicating more Pros or Cons, depending on the subscale. The DB-LDKT was also recently validated in a sample of dialysis patients.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Informed Decision-Making</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Informed Decision-Making will be assessed in two ways. First, patients will be asked the following three questions: &quot;I have all the facts I need to make an informed decision about whether to pursue DDKT/LKDT/remain on dialysis&quot; (agree/disagree). Each of these questions will be treated as individual items and analyzed separately as outcomes.&#xD;
We will also use a validated measure of decisional conflict, the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS). This scale assesses factors contributing to patients' uncertainty in making health-related decisions, and patients' assessment of their perceived effective decision-making. Each of these dimensions of decisional conflict will be considered as subscales, and together they will be considered as a total decisional conflict measure. The entire scale has 16 items (3 for decision uncertainty, 9 for factors contributing to uncertainty, and 4 for effective decision-making), each measured on a scale of (1) strongly agree to (5) strongly disagree.</description>
