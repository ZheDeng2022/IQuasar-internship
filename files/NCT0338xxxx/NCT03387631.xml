  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following the development of drug resistance to antimalarial first line treatment of&#xD;
      uncomplicated malaria with SP by P.falciparum in mainland Tanzania, the Ministry of Health -&#xD;
      Tanzania, introduced ACTs with AL as first line treatment for uncomplicated falciparum&#xD;
      malaria in 2006. In the advent of wide scale deployment of ACT together with strengthened&#xD;
      vector control with LLIN in mainland Tanzania, there is a trend of shrinking the burden of&#xD;
      malaria. The decline of outpatient malaria cases in recent years and declining entomological&#xD;
      inoculation rates (EIR) that are currently being recorded in most areas that were before&#xD;
      considered to be holo/hyper-endemic to malaria transmission is another indicator of the shift&#xD;
      in the epidemiology of malaria transmission in Tanzania. This current shift provides a new&#xD;
      and yet critical challenge with regards to assessment and monitoring of the efficacy of the&#xD;
      first-line treatment specifically considering that artemisinin resistance has been confirmed&#xD;
      in the Greater Mekong sub-region. The aim of the study was to set up a system for country&#xD;
      wide representative surveillance to obtain data of the safety and efficacy of AL following&#xD;
      countrywide use of ACTs for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Tanzania. The study was&#xD;
      conducted in the framework of the existing NMCP sentinel sites that are ecological&#xD;
      representative for malaria endemicity in Tanzania Objective: To assess the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of artemether-lumefantrine, artesunate-amodiaquine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine&#xD;
      for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Tanzania.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The study was conducted in eight sentinel sites of NMCP (Kyela, Mkuzi, Kibaha,&#xD;
      Ujiji, Nagaga, Chamwino, Igombe and Mlimba) in mainland Tanzania. Four sentinel sites&#xD;
      (Mlimba, Mkuzi, Kibaha, and Ujiji) were covered in 2016 and the rest will be involved in the&#xD;
      second round to be undertaken in 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were treated with AL for 3 days and the study was conducted from April to Sept 2016.&#xD;
      The results of this study will assist the Ministry of Health to monitor the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of the ACTs in Tanzania, provide baseline data on parasite clearance time and for&#xD;
      assessing the current national treatment guidelines for uncomplicated falciparum malaria.&#xD;

      The study was on safety and efficacy of artemether lumefantrine for the treatment of&#xD;
      uncomplicated malaria, to be done in 8 National Malaria Control Programme sentinel sites The&#xD;
      study was proposed to be done in 2 phases; the first phase in Mkuzi, Ujiji, Kibaha and Mlimba&#xD;
      fro April 2016-Sept 2016 The second phase to be done in the other 4 sites of Igombe,&#xD;
      Chwamwino, Kyela and Nagaga from February - October 2017&#xD;
