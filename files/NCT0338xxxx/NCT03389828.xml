      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep that does not last long and is low-quality is tied to a range of serious health issues.&#xD;
      These range from obesity to early death. Research has shown that black people who are&#xD;
      professionals or managers are more likely to have this kind of sleep than their white&#xD;
      counterparts. Black people are also at higher risk than whites for health problems caused by&#xD;
      insufficient sleep. Researchers want to learn more about why these differences exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study reasons for racial differences in the work-sleep relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults at least 25 years old who:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are non-Hispanic black or non-Hispanic white&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are employed and work 38 or more hours a week&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Live around Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill, NC, or Washington, DC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with questions. They will give sociodemographic data like job&#xD;
      title, annual income level, and gender. They will give their contact information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 1 study visit. They will be in a closed, private conference room. They&#xD;
      will join a focus group. The focus groups will be organized by to race, gender, and&#xD;
      occupational class.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give informed consent before the focus group begins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the focus group, participants will be asked about their perceptions of health in&#xD;
      general, and their typical work day. They will be asked about sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also fill out a short questionnaire about their job and sleep habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus groups will be audio recorded. The entire session will last 90 to 120 minutes.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior research has documented racial differences in sleep health by occupational class. While&#xD;
      increasing professional responsibility has been associated with shorter sleep duration among&#xD;
      non-Hispanic Blacks, increasing professional responsibility appears to be associated with a&#xD;
      lower prevalence of short sleep duration among non-Hispanic Whites. The objective of the&#xD;
      present study is to investigate reasons for these racial differences in the work-sleep&#xD;
      relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will consist of approximately 340 focus groups participants. All&#xD;
      non-Hispanic black and white adults 25 years of age or older who are currently working at&#xD;
      least 38 hours a week will be eligible for inclusion in the study. To mitigate the influence&#xD;
      of known cultural differences in sleep behaviors, participation will be limited to English&#xD;
      speakers born in the continental United Sates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct 34 demographically homogenous focus groups consisting of 7-12 participants&#xD;
      each. Focus groups will be stratified based race, gender, and occupational class, and will be&#xD;
      conducted in both North Carolina and the metropolitan DC area. Focus groups will take place&#xD;
      in-person and be conducted by a trained facilitator according to a scripted, semi-structured&#xD;
      focus group guide. Audio recordings of the focus groups will be transcribed verbatim by a&#xD;
      professional transcription service. De-identified transcripts will be reviewed by the study&#xD;
      team to identify qualitative themes in the data, which will be coded in an appropriate&#xD;
      software program using a double-coding process. Qualitative data analysis will be conducted&#xD;
      to identify potential reasons for racial differences in sleep health by occupational class.&#xD;
      We will additionally assess variation by other sociodemographic determinants, including&#xD;
      gender, education, income, and geographic region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOMES MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures include the themes/patterns regarding potential system-level influences,&#xD;
      beliefs, and behaviors that may explain racial differences in the association between&#xD;
      occupational class and sleep health.&#xD;
