    <description>Six patients will be enrolled at Dose Level 1 with IRX-2 230 units/day in combination with cyclophosphamide and durvalumab and treated sequentially at least 1 week apart. If less than 2 out of 6 patients have DLTs in Dose Level 1, the dose will be escalated to administration of IRX-2 460 Units/day in combination with cyclophosphamide and durvalumab as Dose Level 2. If 2 of 6 patients have DLTs, stop accrual and re-evaluate. In the next safety phase, six patients at IRX-2 460 Units/day in combination with cyclophosphamide and durvalumab will be enrolled and treated sequentially (at least 1 week apart). If DLT occurs in less than 2 of 6 patients during the first 6 weeks of treatment, enrollment can continue in the dose expansion phase at Dose Level 2. If DLT is observed in 2 of 6 patients, accrual will be stopped and Dose Level 1 will resume in the dose expansion phase.</description>
