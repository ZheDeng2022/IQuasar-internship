  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This large scale multi-center cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) is designed to assess&#xD;
      the comparative effectiveness of three interventions in diverse ambulatory care settings and&#xD;
      patient populations. Findings will help healthcare systems decide which approach to adopt to&#xD;
      empower patients and enable providers to engage in patient centered communication. The&#xD;
      specific aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Engage with patients and healthcare providers who have used the tools in the pilot study&#xD;
           (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT02522286) at the Sutter Health Palo Alto Medical&#xD;
           Foundation (PAMF), as well as new stakeholders at University of California San Diego&#xD;
           Health System and Meyers Primary Care Institute at University of Massachusetts and&#xD;
           Reliant Medical Group, to further refine and adapt these patient-centered interventions&#xD;
           to be integrated into real world primary care clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Conduct a large scale cluster RCT with three arms, to evaluate the comparative&#xD;
           effectiveness of three interventions: OPEN with in-person SPI training (High Touch),&#xD;
           OPEN with online SPI training (High Tech), and ASK. Primary outcomes will include&#xD;
           patient perceptions of how well their PCPs have engaged them in patient centered&#xD;
           communication. The investigators will also measure patients' confidence in managing&#xD;
           their health, intention to follow through with care plans, and downstream behaviors in&#xD;
           following through with care plans, use of services such as phone calls, secure&#xD;
           messaging, and additional visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Identify the strategy that has the most potential for sustained impact and replication&#xD;
           within and across healthcare systems. The investigators will analyze the fidelity to the&#xD;
           intervention protocols, including consistency of delivery as intended and the&#xD;
           time/effort involved in implementing the interventions. The investigators will also&#xD;
           assess the extent to which the programs become institutionalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate that this multi-level healthcare system intervention will result&#xD;
      in significant improvement in: patient satisfaction with how PCP has engaged them in the&#xD;
      visit, confidence in selfcare; patients' intention to adhere to care plan, and clinical&#xD;
      indicators. Furthermore, more effective communication would lower health service utilization&#xD;
      after the visit. The investigators further expect that the intervention will affect&#xD;
      physicians', medical assistants' and nurses' experience as well as healthcare system leaders'&#xD;
      intention to implement in routine practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a three-arm, multi-site, cluster-randomized controlled trial, comparing three&#xD;
      approaches to improve communication between patients and their doctors. Three health systems&#xD;
      will participate in the study: UCSD Health, Reliant Medical Group, and Sutter Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out in 2 phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Phase 1 includes intervention and survey development work to take place prior to the&#xD;
      RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OPEN High Touch intervention - The High Touch intervention will be modeled after the Open&#xD;
      Communication intervention developed in the pilot (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT02522286)&#xD;
      which contained three components: (a) a one question pre-visit survey delivered through the&#xD;
      patient portal of the EHR, asking patients what they most want to discuss with their&#xD;
      physician in the upcoming visit; (b) an animated video for patients providing coaching on how&#xD;
      to best prepare for their upcoming visits and get the most from the visits; and (c)&#xD;
      Standardized Patient Instructor (SPI) providing communication coaching for physicians on how&#xD;
      to incorporate what matter most to patients in the visit, with empathy, and clarity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OPEN High Tech intervention - For the High Tech arm, the patient components of the&#xD;
      intervention will be identical to the patient components of the High Touch arm (i.e., the&#xD;
      pre-visit survey and patient coaching video). The difference will be in the PCP training: we&#xD;
      will replace the in-person SPI with a mobile app with embedded audio and video vignettes&#xD;
      demonstrating the communication challenges (e.g., patient with a big list of issues, patients&#xD;
      who resist physician recommendations, and patients who disagree with physician) and&#xD;
      recommended strategies. A mobile app offers several advantages, including being accessible at&#xD;
      a convenient time for busy providers, being easily disseminated, and easily updated. The app&#xD;
      will be interactive, posing questions to learners in association with video vignettes and&#xD;
      asking learners to answer how they would handle the situation. We will start with the idea of&#xD;
      building a set of short mobile modules that mirror the High Touch approach, honing skills on&#xD;
      acknowledging patient's agenda, negotiate a joint agenda, invite patient to teachback and&#xD;
      incorporate it in the After Visit Summary in the EHR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASK intervention - The ASK intervention is intended to activate patients by encouraging them&#xD;
      to ask three questions during their primary care visit: (1) What are my options? (2) What are&#xD;
      the possible benefits and risks of each option? (3) How likely are each of the benefits and&#xD;
      risks to happen to me? These questions will be printed on posters and placed in exam rooms&#xD;
      used by providers in clinics randomized to the ASK arm of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Phase 2 covers the trial recruitment, and three waves of data collection. Prior to&#xD;
      the start of the RCT we will collect baseline (T0) data to allow measurement of primary care&#xD;
      provider (PCP) performance prior to the trial. Patients participating in the T0 phase will&#xD;
      provide only post-visit ratings of their encounters; we will not collect other outcome data&#xD;
      or clinical indicators for these patients. For all patients in the intervention phase, we&#xD;
      will be collecting information at two time points: 1) immediately post-encounter (T1); and 2)&#xD;
      three months post-encounter (T2). We will further sample the top 5% high users of services&#xD;
      after the intervention and review their medical records including the indexed visit and&#xD;
      subsequent services that had occurred within four weeks after the indexed visit. The chart&#xD;
      review will enable us to decipher the reasons for high volume of services after the indexed&#xD;
      visit. We will also use existing patient survey data (Press-Ganey and/or NRC) to supplement&#xD;
      our data sources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytical approach: We will apply intention to treat analysis, providing descriptive&#xD;
      statistics on relevant outcome measures across patients, PCPs, and clinics according to their&#xD;
      randomized assignments in the RCT. We will then use generalized estimating equations logistic&#xD;
      regression analysis to examine the impact of the assignment into the intervention arms and&#xD;
      the outcomes, while controlling for patient and physician covariates.&#xD;
