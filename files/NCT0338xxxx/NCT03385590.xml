  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this intervention study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of&#xD;
      soy-fiber-maize versus soy-maize complementary foods on bowel movement frequency, transit&#xD;
      time, growth, gastrointestinal symptoms, microbiota composition and activity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 6-month randomized study to assess the feasibility and acceptability of&#xD;
      soy-fiber-maize complementary food. Participants (caregiver/mother - child pairs) will&#xD;
      complete a 2-week baseline period during which stool frequency, and stool consistency will be&#xD;
      collected by paper questionnaire, and participants will collect a single stool. Dietary data&#xD;
      will be obtained at baseline, 3 months and at 6 months during the study period. Participants&#xD;
      will receive soy-fiber-maize or maize complementary foods twice a day for 6 months.&#xD;
      Participants will attend a study visit every week for study food collection. During the study&#xD;
      visit at baseline, 3 and 6 months, participants will complete a 24-hour dietary recall and&#xD;
      height, weight and Mid Upper Arm Circumference will be measured on the children. At these&#xD;
      same times, participants will provide stool samples. Participants will complete weekly&#xD;
      questionnaires to assess gastrointestinal health, stool frequency and stool form.&#xD;
      Furthermore, participants will participate in a focus group discussion at the end of the 6&#xD;
      months' study period to assess the feasibility and acceptability of soy-fiber-maize&#xD;
      complementary foods for their children. Stool samples will be analyzed for differences in the&#xD;
      microbiota.&#xD;
