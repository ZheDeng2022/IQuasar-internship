  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) is among the costliest and deadliest substance use&#xD;
      disorders (SUDs) world-wide and is frequently comorbid with other mental health conditions.&#xD;
      There is no empirically validated medical treatment for MUD. Drug craving is the signature&#xD;
      aspect of MUD and other substance use disorders and has been associated with continued drug&#xD;
      use and relapse. The investigators and others have shown that transcranial direct current&#xD;
      stimulation (tDCS) over dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) can modulate drug craving in&#xD;
      different SUDs. tDCS is a method of non-invasive brain stimulation and is a low-cost scalable&#xD;
      technology without any serious side effects that delivers low levels of direct current (0.1-2&#xD;
      mAmp) transcranially. However, there are significant inter-individual differences in response&#xD;
      to tDCS, which is not well understood but can have profound impact on efficacy. Meanwhile,&#xD;
      there are no studies with neuroimaging to show how tDCS affects drug craving. Investigators&#xD;
      propose the first combined tDCS/functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) study to examine&#xD;
      the acute effects of tDCS on neural substrates underlying drug induced craving.&#xD;

      Methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) is among the costliest and deadliest substance use&#xD;

      investigators propose the first combined tDCS/functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)&#xD;
      study to examine the acute effects of tDCS on neural substrates underlying drug induced&#xD;
      craving. The investigators hypothesize that tDCS amplifies DLPFC's top-down modulatory role&#xD;
      via its connectivity to other cortical-subcortical areas. In this double blind randomized&#xD;
      experimental design, the investigators will recruit 60 people with MUD during their early&#xD;
      abstinence phases into parallel arms with active and sham DLPFC tDCS. Each subject will&#xD;
      undergo resting state and task based (drug cue exposure paradigm) functional MRI pre and post&#xD;
      tDCS. The investigators will conduct individual difference analyses to explore the potential&#xD;
      predictors for tDCS response, including pre-tDCS top-down connectivity measures of DLPFC and&#xD;
      other subjective, clinical, behavioral, structural, and functional variables. The results of&#xD;
      this study will provide neuroscience-based evidence for the efficacy of tDCS and will advance&#xD;
      the field towards precision addiction medicine.&#xD;
