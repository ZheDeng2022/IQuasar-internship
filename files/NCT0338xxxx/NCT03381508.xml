  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The software embedded in recent continuous positive pressure devices enables the analysis of&#xD;
      the level of leakage that occurs during treatment around the mask or from the mouth. However,&#xD;
      there is no clear threshold defining when it would be appropriate to implement means for&#xD;
      correcting these leaks. In addition, the calculation methods used to detect/measure leaks and&#xD;
      the terminology used vary according to the manufacturers of continuous pressure devices,&#xD;
      which also complicates the clinical interpretation of the leakage reports provided by the&#xD;
      various devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In daily practice, when a patient complains of unintentional leakage, technicians adjust the&#xD;
      mask, replace the nasal-mask by an oro-nasal mask or install a chinstrap. Nevertheless, those&#xD;
      strategies are not always effective in reducing leakage or patient's complaints. A better&#xD;
      understanding of the mechanisms beyond leak appearance for a given patient could lead to&#xD;
      individualised leak-treatment solutions. Pressure level, mandibular behaviour, respiratory&#xD;
      effort, sleep position or sleep stages may contribute to leak emergence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent exploratory study has proposed a genuine analysis method of determining factors of&#xD;
      unintentional-leaks using polysomnographic recordings in OSA patients treated with automatic&#xD;
      Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (auto-CPAP). Based on the same methodology, the NOMICS&#xD;
      company (Liège, Belgium) has developed a polygraphic device (Brizzy®) recording unintentional&#xD;
      leakage during auto-CPAP treatment and providing an etiological analysis of&#xD;
      unintentional-leaks via a software named APIOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the innovative nature of the analysis, it appears necessary to validate it onto a&#xD;
      population of OSA patients treated with auto-CPAP. Also, to our knowledge, there is no&#xD;
      descriptive data of the distribution of the determinants of unintentional leaks in such a&#xD;
      population. From this perspective, the investigators aim to retrospectively analyse some&#xD;
      polygraphic recordings that have been performed with the Brizzy® on OSA patients treated with&#xD;
      auto-CPAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to identify and describe the determinants of&#xD;
      unintentional leaks for a population of patients with OSA and treated with an auto-CPAP&#xD;
      device&#xD;

      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to evaluate the concordance of the determinants of leaks according to different leak&#xD;
           thresholds (0 l/min ; 5l/min ; 10l/min : 20l/min).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to describe any technical problems that arise in relation to the analysis of leaks in&#xD;
           the study population.&#xD;
