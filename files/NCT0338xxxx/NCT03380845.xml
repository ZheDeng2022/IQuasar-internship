  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this randomized, split-face, controlled study is to compare the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of a erbium-doped 1,550-nm non-ablative fractional laser and a bipolar&#xD;
      fractional radiofrequency microneedle device for the treatment of atrophic facial acne scars&#xD;
      in ethnic skin (Fitzpatrick Skin Phototypes III-VI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that both erbium-doped 1,550-nm non-ablative fractional laser&#xD;
      and the bipolar fractional radiofrequency microneedle device are equally effective for the&#xD;
      treatment of atrophic acne scars in ethnic skin (SPT III-VI). However, the bipolar fractional&#xD;
      radiofrequency microneedle device has less adverse effects than erbium-doped 1,550-nm&#xD;
      non-ablative fractional laser due to the absence of scattering and the absence of&#xD;
      chromophore-specific targets - predominantly melanin - traditionally needed with laser&#xD;
      treatments; hence the fractional radiofrequency microneedle device will have a higher safety&#xD;
      profile in darker skin types .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acne is a highly prevalent disease and post-acne scaring has shown to have detrimental&#xD;
      effects on a person's physical, mental, and social well-being. Acne scars can be divided in&#xD;
      general categories of hypertrophic or keloid scars, atrophic scars (icepick, rolling,&#xD;
      boxcar), and pigmentation alterations (redness, hypo and hyper-pigmentation). This study will&#xD;
      focus on treatment of moderate to severe grades of atrophic acne scarring. Our aim is to&#xD;
      compare the efficacy and safety of a erbium-doped 1,550-nm non-ablative fractional laser and&#xD;
      a bipolar fractional radiofrequency microneedle device for the treatment of atrophic acne&#xD;
      scars in ethnic skin (Fitzpatrick Skin Phototypes III-VI) by performing a split-face&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both devices in this study are already FDA approved treatment modalities for acne scarring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      History of erbium-doped 1,550-nm non-ablative fractional laser (Fraxel® Restore Laser System,&#xD;
      Solta Medical, Inc., Hayward, CA):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-ablative fractional lasers work via the theory of fractional photothermolysis, which&#xD;
      creates hundreds to thousands of microscopic thermal zones (MTZs), or columns of thermally&#xD;
      injured skin, while sparing the surrounding tissue. The pixilated nature of treatment and the&#xD;
      functionally unimpaired stratum corneum allow for rapid tissue healing and allows for safer&#xD;
      treatments of our patients. Mechanistically, fractional photothermolysis allows controlled&#xD;
      amounts of high energy to be delivered deep within the dermis resulting in collagenolysis and&#xD;
      neocollagenesis, which smoothes the textural abnormalities of acne scarring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple published studies have demonstrated that erbium-doped 1,550-nm non-ablative&#xD;
      fractional laser (&quot;NAFL&quot;) can be successfully utilized in the treatment of all forms of&#xD;
      atrophic acne scarring - ice-pick, boxcar, and rolling scars - with a very favorable safety&#xD;
      profile in all skin types, and thus, has been cleared by Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#xD;
      for that particular indication. According to the manufacture manual (reference attached in&#xD;
      the &quot;Attachments&quot; section), NAFL is indicated for &quot;use in skin resurfacing procedures as well&#xD;
      as treatment of acne scars, surgical scars, lentigos (age spots), solar lentigos (sun spots),&#xD;
      actinic keratosis, and melasma.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      History of the fractional radiofrequency microneedle device (Fractora; Invasix Ltd./InMode MD&#xD;
      Ltd., Israel):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fractional radiofrequency is not a laser. Instead, these devices use an array of electrodes&#xD;
      that allows for zones of thermal wounds to be created between areas of unaffected zones, thus&#xD;
      stimulating dermal remodeling and allowing for a supply of reservoir cells to promote&#xD;
      healing. Variations of fractional radiofrequency exist that employ microneedles to deliver&#xD;
      electrical current to a particular depth within the dermis that decreases damage to the&#xD;
      epidermis. These fractional radiofrequency microneedle devices provide an alternative to&#xD;
      conventional methods of acne-scar treatment (such as NAFL). Great interest has been&#xD;
      culminating over the recent years for the use of such devices in acne scars due to the&#xD;
      absence of light scattering and the absence of chromophore-specific targets traditionally&#xD;
      needed with laser treatments. As melanin is not a target, it is felt to have a higher safety&#xD;
      profile in darker skin phototypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study investigated the safety and efficacy of a specific bipolar fractional&#xD;
      radiofrequency microneedle device (Fractora; Invasix Ltd./InMode MD Ltd., Israel) for acne&#xD;
      and acne scarring. In this study, 8 patients with acne scars were reported and it was noted&#xD;
      that all patients (regardless of their skin phototypes) had improvement in their active acne&#xD;
      and acne scars after 4 treatments and a 1 month, on average follow-up period. The treatment&#xD;
      was well tolerated without any side-effects. Skin biopsies from this study showed reduction&#xD;
      in scar depth and new collagen formation with an increase in elastic fibers and adnexal&#xD;
      structures noted. A follow-up report showed that 4 out of 8 patients who were in the original&#xD;
      study returned for a long term follow-up from 1 to 2 years, that showed ongoing clinical&#xD;
      improvements in these patients. This specific bipolar fractional radiofrequency microneedle&#xD;
      (&quot;FRM&quot;) device has been FDA-approved for acne scars and skin rejuvenation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this date the efficacy and safety of 1,550-nm fractionated photothermolysis system has not&#xD;
      been compared to a fractional radiofrequency microneedle device for atrophic acne scars in&#xD;
      ethnic skin in a randomized split-face controlled trial. A major advantage of a split-face&#xD;
      self-controlled design would be to minimize any confounding factors. Laser resurfacing has&#xD;
      been well studied and is widely used in individuals with fair skin - Fitzpatrick skin&#xD;
      phototypes (SPT) I to II. However, there is a paucity of published studies involving&#xD;
      individuals with darker skin types (SPT III-VI)-a population that has a higher risk of&#xD;
      laser-associated dyspigmentation.&#xD;
