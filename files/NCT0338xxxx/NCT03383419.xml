    <textblock>
      This phase II, multi-center, open-label study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      utilizing HCV-positive donors for heart transplant in HCV-negative recipients treated with&#xD;
      sofosbuvir 400 mg / velpatasvir 100 mg (Epclusa®).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      utilizing HCV-positive donors (defined as HCV-NAT positive) for heart transplantation in&#xD;
      HCV-negative recipients treated with Epclusa®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be identified from the heart transplantation waitlist. Subjects who, according&#xD;
      to the judgement of the Investigator, would have a net mortality benefit from cardiac&#xD;
      transplantation irrespective of donor HCV status will be asked if they agree to receive a&#xD;
      heart transplant from an HCV-positive donor. Subjects who sign consent and receive a heart&#xD;
      transplant from an HCV-positive donor will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consented subjects who do not demonstrate immunity to hepatitis B (manifest as negative&#xD;
      qualitative or quantitative Hepatitis B surface Ab) will be encouraged to immediately begin a&#xD;
      non-infectious recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen vaccination series, combined with, or&#xD;
      in parallel to, an inactive hepatitis A vaccination at the treating clinician's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled recipients will be closely surveilled with serial HCV polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
      (PCR) as inpatients during the immediate post-OHT hospitalization and subsequently as&#xD;
      specified in the post-transplant period assessements. Donor serum will be collected at&#xD;
      transplant harvest and will be sent by the transplant center for HCV NAT and genotyping. If&#xD;
      and when these recipients develop confirmed viremia by HCV PCR, Epclusa® therapy will be&#xD;
      administered for a 12-week course. The study drug, Epclusa®, will be provided by Gilead&#xD;
      Sciences, Inc. Study drug, Epclusa®, comes in bottles that contain 28 tablets each. Serologic&#xD;
      data will also be collected. If an enrolled subject does not develop quantifiable viremia by&#xD;
      week 12, they will be followed by standard of care surveillance, with additional standard of&#xD;
      care surveillance per UNOS mandate for CDC-increased-risk donors and discontinued from study;&#xD;
      additional subjects may be enrolled at the Principal Consortium Investigator's discretion to&#xD;
      complete 20 Epclusa®-treated subjects according to the protocol.&#xD;
