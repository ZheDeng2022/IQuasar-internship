      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and serum concentrations of a human&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody, VRC-HIVMAB075-00-AB (VRC07-523LS), administered in multiple doses and&#xD;
      routes to healthy, HIV-uninfected adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of six groups. Participants in Group 1 will&#xD;
      receive 2.5 mg/kg of VRC07-523LS by intravenous (IV) infusion at Weeks 0, 16, 32, 48, and 64.&#xD;
      Participants in Group 2 will receive 5 mg/kg of VRC07-523LS by IV infusion at Weeks 0, 16,&#xD;
      32, 48, and 64. Participants in Group 3 will receive 20 mg/kg of VRC07-523LS by IV infusion&#xD;
      at Weeks 0, 16, 32, 48, and 64. Participants in Group 4 will receive 2.5 mg/kg of VRC07-523LS&#xD;
      by subcutaneous (SC) injection at Weeks 0, 16, 32, 48, and 64. Participants in Group 5 will&#xD;
      receive 5 mg/kg of VRC07-523LS by SC injection at Weeks 0, 16, 32, 48, and 64. Participants&#xD;
      in Group 6 will receive 2.5 mg/kg of VRC07-523LS or placebo by intramuscular (IM) injection&#xD;
      at Weeks 0, 16, 32, 48, and 64.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend numerous study visits throughout the course of the study, beginning&#xD;
      at Week 0 through Week 112. Visits may include physical examinations, blood and urine&#xD;
      collection, HIV testing, risk reduction counseling, and questionnaires.&#xD;
