  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess feasibility of the application of an adapted&#xD;
      version, with permission, of Dr. Cenk Tek's Simplified Intervention to Modify Physical&#xD;
      activity, Lifestyle, and Eating behavior (SIMPLE Program), at Pathways to Housing in Calgary,&#xD;
      Alberta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. Tek and his colleagues reviewed the literature and eloquently summarized how individuals&#xD;
      with severe mental illness, particularly schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder are&#xD;
      disproportionately affected by obesity and its cardio-metabolic sequelae leading to markedly&#xD;
      reduced longevity and increased healthcare costs. Most new antipsychotic medications, which&#xD;
      are credited for significant advances in patients' quality of life, appear to induce further&#xD;
      weight gain, compounding the problem of obesity and related medical morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      In addition to the weight gain associated with psychiatric medications, sedentary life style,&#xD;
      lack of availability of healthy food options, poverty, low level of physical activity,&#xD;
      cigarette smoking, and inadequate knowledge or understanding of health maintenance, appear to&#xD;
      contribute to the increased obesity rates and poor health in the severely mentally ill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. Tek and colleagues reviewed the available literature on weight loss interventions in&#xD;
      individuals with severe mental illness. Despite the overwhelming problems related to obesity,&#xD;
      Dr. Tek's team found that research on obesity interventions for persons with schizophrenia is&#xD;
      relatively neglected and that there were no treatments that were convincingly shown to be&#xD;
      effective for weight reduction in this population with unique needs. Sensing a major societal&#xD;
      gap, they decided to create their own weight loss intervention specifically for individuals&#xD;
      with severe mental illness. Toward this aim, they collaborated with Dr. Kelly Brownell who&#xD;
      created the Lifestyle, Exercise, Attitudes, Relationships, and Nutrition or LEARN Program.&#xD;
      This multi-faceted program is designed to promote positive changes in motivation, attitude&#xD;
      and deeply ingrained habits that will lead to long lasting weight loss. Brownell's LEARN&#xD;
      program is a self-directed weight loss program that empowers the user to make lifestyle&#xD;
      changes. Dr. Tek and his colleagues modified and built upon the program by creating the&#xD;
      Simplified Intervention to Modify Physical activity, Lifestyle, and Eating behavior or SIMPLE&#xD;
      program specifically for individuals with severe mental illness&#xD;
      (http://www.simpleprogram.org/).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SIMPLE program is a group weight loss intervention designed for obese patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Dr. Tek and his team piloted their modified weight&#xD;
      loss program and published their findings in 2007. Their preliminary study yielded greater&#xD;
      weight loss than any of the published randomized controlled trials for a chronic and stable&#xD;
      schizophrenia sample, and was the only study to show continued weight loss after the&#xD;
      intervention ended. These early results prompted a new larger randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      with the largest sample studied to date, an extended period of follow-up, and more detailed&#xD;
      testing of the effects of weight loss on schizophrenia symptoms, quality of life, and&#xD;
      laboratory markers of obesity related illness risk over a period of up to 16 months.&#xD;
      Preliminary results of this trial show significant, sustained weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study presented for ethics review, is to apply Dr. Tek's 16-week&#xD;
      intervention to a small group of patients at the Pathways to Housing program in Calgary,&#xD;
      Alberta. The study coordinator will use Dr. Tek's published manuals, giving full&#xD;
      acknowledgment to the authors, to create weekly supportive educational sessions for the group&#xD;
      of patients. Three Pathways to Housing staff members, who regularly create education groups&#xD;
      for Pathways to Housing patients during a weekly &quot;lifestyle group&quot;, will sit in on each&#xD;
      session. Weight (to calculate BMI) and waist circumference will be measured weekly. There&#xD;
      will be no control group. The proposed feasibility study is designed to fit seamlessly within&#xD;
      existing frameworks at Pathways to Housing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the study, we will convene a debriefing session with both the participants&#xD;
      and the three Pathways to Housing staff to learn whether patients found the intervention&#xD;
      valuable, and whether staff members feel capable of implementing the program on their own&#xD;
      going forward. If the program is found to be feasible, the materials created will be&#xD;
      available for future use by the multidisciplinary team at Pathways to Housing.&#xD;
