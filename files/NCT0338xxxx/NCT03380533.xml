  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair is associated with poor post-operative pain management. The&#xD;
      multimodal analgesic scheme (oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs associated with oral&#xD;
      opioids) currently used according to the pain management guidelines is insufficient for most&#xD;
      of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are few reports on the use of buprenorphine in post-operative pain with encouraging&#xD;
      results. There is no evidence of its use in the management of post-operative pain of&#xD;
      arthroscopic rotator cuff repair&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traditionally, oral opioids have been used to manage the postoperative pain of arthroscopic&#xD;
      rotator cuff repair (ARCR) . Due to the intensity of pain, it often requires high doses of&#xD;
      opioids, frequently associated with side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, constipation,&#xD;
      disorientation, among others, which, in the context of an outpatient, interfere with the&#xD;
      postoperative period, sometimes resulting in hospital readmissions. due to both the poor&#xD;
      management of pain and the adverse effects of opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there are invasive strategies of analgesia, such as the placement of continuous&#xD;
      infusion catheters of analgesics in the sub-acromial space, these are methods that demand the&#xD;
      management of the devices, in some cases requiring prolongation of hospitalization for the&#xD;
      patient. management of the same, without being exempt from complications as any analgesic&#xD;
      method added to those related to the method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the post-operative analgesia strategy widely accepted globally and that used in&#xD;
      our center, is multimodal analgesia, in which NSAIDs (Anti-Inflammatory Non-Steroids) and&#xD;
      oral opioids are associated. A combination of both analgesic mechanisms of action is used as&#xD;
      a basic scheme, and rescues with opioids are carried out orally. Although the literature&#xD;
      supports its cost-benefit, this approach is often insufficient, not achieving adequate&#xD;
      control of postoperative pain in ARCR, with 64% of our patients reporting poor pain&#xD;
      management in the first week of post-operative and 10% that require re-entry to day hospital&#xD;
      for pain management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The application of transdermal opioid release patches is a method of non-invasive analgesia,&#xD;
      which has previously been used with good results for the management of postoperative pain. In&#xD;
      ARCR there is no evidence of its use in the management of post-operative pain The main&#xD;
      advantages could be related to the plasma stability of the drug (buprenorphine), which&#xD;
      implies fewer peaks and valleys of analgesia, a better compliance by the patient since it is&#xD;
      of weekly duration and lower incidence of cognitive deterioration related to other opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared with other opioids, buprenorphine is associated with a lower risk of abuse, overdose&#xD;
      and poisoning due to the ceiling effect. Despite this favorable pharmacological profile, the&#xD;
      use of buprenorphine in patches has a lower abuse rate than other forms of administering the&#xD;
      same drug. On the one hand, the release rate of the patch may be insufficient to satisfy the&#xD;
      compulsive desire and, to that end, the patch may be less desirable. On the other hand, the&#xD;
      availability in the market and the way to use the patches could be other conditioning&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
