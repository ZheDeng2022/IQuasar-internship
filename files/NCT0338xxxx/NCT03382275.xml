    <textblock>
      By describing the characteristics of iron deficiency (ID) patients treated with various oral&#xD;
      or intravenous iron formulations and their outcomes, this registry will provide the medical&#xD;
      community with important information to support treatment decisions for their patients&#xD;
      regarding data on effectiveness, safety, tolerability, treatment persistence, quality of&#xD;
      life, and therapeutic costs. This will ultimately support improvements to patient care,&#xD;
      including the long-term outcomes of patients with ID.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency (ID) anaemia is a prevalent condition in Germany and other Western countries.&#xD;
      It is a common complication in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      including chronic heart failure, cancer, chronic kidney disease (CKD), gynaecological&#xD;
      conditions, and others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaemia has a strong impact on patient's quality of life and ability to work, and removing&#xD;
      the condition by increasing the haemoglobin may improve QoL and other patient-related&#xD;
      outcomes. While in certain patient groups, such as CKD, anaemia is addressed on a routine&#xD;
      basis, in others it remains widely undertreated. For example, in IBD patients across various&#xD;
      European countries, iron supplementation was administered in only up to 28% of individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For iron supplementation aimed to replenish to body' iron stores, there are numerous oral,&#xD;
      and intravenous preparations available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most convenient approach is oral administration, where Fe2+ salts are mostly used.&#xD;
      Usually low doses between 50 - 100 mg daily are recommended, as the duodenum can only absorb&#xD;
      10 - 20 mg daily, and higher doses are associated with gastrointestinal side effects&#xD;
      including diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence and gastric erosions. To reduce these common side&#xD;
      effects, Fe3+ formulations like ferric maltol (Feraccru) have been newly introduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous preparations are all Fe3+ oxyhydroxides with a carbohydrate coat (iron dextran,&#xD;
      gluconate, sucrose, carboxymaltose, or ferumexytol). These preparations are typically used&#xD;
      second-line in patients with ID who had unsatisfactory treatment results under oral&#xD;
      treatment. IV iron infusions have been associated with hypophosphataemia and hypersensitivity&#xD;
      reactions. However these events depend on the preparation and are infrequent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLAIN-IRON has been set up as the first interdisciplinary registry to add further&#xD;
      information on the situation and management of patients who receive iron substitution in&#xD;
      various indications: IBD, chronic kidney disease, cancer- or therapy-induced ID,&#xD;
      gynaecological conditions (hypermenorrhoea, post-partum, fatigue), cardiological indications&#xD;
      (congenital heart disease; chronic heart failure) and other causes of ID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registry will allow for documentation of all approved oral and IV preparations. As the&#xD;
      registry also serves the specific purpose to collect data on the newly introduced preparation&#xD;
      Feraccru (oral ferric maltol), about half of the patient population will be treated with that&#xD;
      agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registry will be of interest to assess to which extent the various guidelines on iron&#xD;
      substitution have been adopted in clinical practice. Overall, EXPLAIN-IRON is expected to&#xD;
      provide a comprehensive picture on the use and the outcomes of iron substitution in Germany.&#xD;
      By describing the characteristics of ID patients treated with various iron formulations and&#xD;
      their outcomes, this registry will provide the medical community with important information&#xD;
      to support treatment decisions for their patients regarding data on effectiveness, safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, treatment persistence, quality of life, and therapeutic costs. This will&#xD;
      ultimately support improvements to patient care, including the long-term outcomes of patients&#xD;
      with ID.&#xD;
