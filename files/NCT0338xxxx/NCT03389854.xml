  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is designed to assess the safety, dosing, and preliminary efficacy of a&#xD;
      novel penile traction device on correcting deformities relating to Peyronie's disease, a&#xD;
      condition which results in penile curvature and length loss. The trial is designed as a&#xD;
      randomized, placebo-controlled study with men randomized to receiving no therapy or penile&#xD;
      traction therapy 30 minutes once, twice, or three times daily. The study will occur over a 3&#xD;
      month period, after which an open label phase for 3 months will be conducted. Final&#xD;
      assessments for adverse effects will also be assessed at 9 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peyronie's disease (PD) is a fibrotic condition of the penis, affecting 1-13% of the US male&#xD;
      population. The disease results in penile curvature and significant psychosocial bother.&#xD;
      Current preferred therapies for PD include repeated penile injections with bacterial enzymes&#xD;
      and surgery. However, these therapies are expensive and in some cases result in permanent&#xD;
      reductions in penile length and sensation. Penile traction therapy (PTT) is a relatively&#xD;
      newer treatment which has been proposed as a treatment for PD with preliminary data&#xD;
      suggesting a potential role. However, currently available PTT devices are primarily designed&#xD;
      for penile lengthening and have many significant limitations including a requirement of use&#xD;
      for 9 hours daily and significant difficulties in personal application. Given these&#xD;
      limitations, a new penile traction device (RestoreX® ) was created and funded through Mayo&#xD;
      Ventures and was specifically designed to treat men with PD. The primary objective of the&#xD;
      current study is to evaluate safety of the device using various dosing schedules, with&#xD;
      secondary endpoints designed to assess efficacy and subjective outcomes. To accomplish the&#xD;
      study, a population of men from Mayo Clinic with PD will be enrolled and will be randomized&#xD;
      to utilize the device for varying amounts of time. Outcomes will be assessed at 3, 6, and 9&#xD;
      months, and results are to be used with the intent to publish in a scientific journal.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Men will be randomized into one of four groups: no traction therapy, penile traction 30 minutes once daily, penile traction 30 minutes twice daily, and penile traction 30 minutes three times daily. This treatment will continue for 3 months, after which men will enter an open label phase for 3 months. Primary and secondary outcomes will be evaluated at the completion of the 3 month and 6 month time points. Additional AEs will be assessed at 9 months after study initiation.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Double (Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Objective outcomes including penile length and curvature will be masked for the investigator and outcome assessor by obtaining photographs of the penis in the lateral and dorsal planes. Curvatures will also be assessed by a clinician in the case where photographs are not able to be obtained or if the participant refuses photographs. These will be assessed without any knowledge as to which grouping the patient is located by two independent reviewers. If there are differences &gt;5 degrees (curvature), or 0.5 cm (length), a 3rd individual will mediate the difference.</masking_description>
