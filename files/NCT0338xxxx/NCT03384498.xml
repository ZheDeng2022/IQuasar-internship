    <textblock>
      This study is to determine the prevalence and geographical distribution of antimalarial drug&#xD;
      resistance-linked genetic mutations in clinical P. falciparum and/or P.Vivax infection in the&#xD;
      Greater Mekong Subregion&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational study of patients with clinical Plasmodium falciparum&#xD;
      and/or Plasmodium Viviax infection using parasite DNA from point-of-care fingerprick dried&#xD;
      blood spot samples as well as a short survey on patient demographics, employment, travel, and&#xD;
      mobile phone use to study P. falciparum parasite genotypes, population characteristics, and&#xD;
      gene flow patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On inclusion in the study and before standard treatment is administered, dried blood spots&#xD;
      (DBS) will be obtained through fingerprick blood sampling from patients, with two or three&#xD;
      blood spots on one piece of filter paper being obtained from each patient. Each blood spot&#xD;
      will contain ~20Âµl of blood, for a total of ~ 40-60 uL of blood being collected from each&#xD;
      patient for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to have a greater understanding of the possible sites of malaria transmission and to&#xD;
      relate genetic diversity to geographic location, patients or their parents/guardians will&#xD;
      also be asked a short set of questions on demographics, their places of residence and work,&#xD;
      recent mobile phone use, and their history of travel. The basic questions on phone&#xD;
      utilisation will provide information on the use of mobile phones in the study population,&#xD;
      including which mobile phone companies are used, and how many SIM cards and handsets each&#xD;
      person carries. It will be employed to derive information on population movement from&#xD;
      anonymised, aggregated data on mobile phone telephone use, i.e. call detail records (CDR),&#xD;
      obtained from mobile phone companies in each country. This will be used for the modelling of&#xD;
      population movement, its impact on the distribution of malaria and antimalarial drug&#xD;
      resistance, and subsequent prediction of potential routes of spread of malaria and&#xD;
      antimalarial drug resistance. As some of this information can be sensitive, during the&#xD;
      consent process the patient will be given the option of not providing some or all of this&#xD;
      information without needing to provide a reason. For those who do not wish to provide&#xD;
      information, this will be documented in the survey form. A duplicate of the sample barcode&#xD;
      will be placed on this same form, so the information therein can be matched with the relevant&#xD;
      blood spot and its related genetic data, while retaining sample anonymity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients in the study will receive standard care for falciparum malaria including drug&#xD;
      therapy according to the national treatment guidelines of their country.&#xD;
