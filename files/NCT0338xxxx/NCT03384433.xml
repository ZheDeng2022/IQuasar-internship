      Administration of cell-free exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs) can be&#xD;
      sufficient to exert therapeutic effects of intact MSCs after brain injury. In this study we&#xD;
      aim to assay the administration of MSC derived exosome on improvement of disability of&#xD;
      patients with acute ischemic stroke&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exosomes derived from multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) promote neurovascular&#xD;
      remodeling and functional recovery after stroke. Animal study has shown that Exosome&#xD;
      treatment markedly increased the number of newly formed doublecortin (a marker of&#xD;
      neuroblasts) and von Willebrand factor (a marker of endothelial cells) cells. Based on&#xD;
      previous literature, intravenous administration of MSC-generated exosomes post stroke&#xD;
      improves functional recovery and enhances neurite remodeling, neurogenesis, and angiogenesis&#xD;
      and represents a novel treatment for stroke. Also some studies have presented which&#xD;
      miR-124-Loaded Exosomes ameliorate the brain Injury by promoting neurogenesis. So in present&#xD;
      study we aim to assess improving patients with acute ischemic stroke who received MSC derived&#xD;
      exosome&#xD;
