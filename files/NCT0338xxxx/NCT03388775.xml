    <textblock>
      Background: Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is a common and important vascular disease due to&#xD;
      its morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Its incidence remains high throughout the world and constitutes serious problems for national&#xD;
      and international public health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several inherited and/or acquired risk factors may be responsible for thrombus formation. Few&#xD;
      epidemiological data regarding real world panorama of this disease in South America and&#xD;
      Brazil is available in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Evaluate demographic data, diagnostic methods and treatment of deep vein&#xD;
      thrombosis in the real world in public university hospitals in Brazil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Five-year prospective records of deep venous thrombosis have been collected by the&#xD;
      RHEUNI group of five public schools in the State of São Paulo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data of patients will be evaluated along with the main risk factors, clinical&#xD;
      picture, diagnostic methods, use of different drugs to treat the disease and its&#xD;
      complications. Digital platform has been used in data collection. Is a multicenter study and&#xD;
      analysis will be performed using Microsoft Excel and Epi-Info.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key words: deep vein thrombosis, assessment, risk factors, demographic data.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Introduction DVT is a multidisciplinary disease, mainly as consequence of surgical or&#xD;
      clinical conditions, and the acute pulmonary embolism and the post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS)&#xD;
      are the most serious complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of deep venous thrombosis of the lower limbs in the population is from 0.2 to&#xD;
      0.7 cases per 1,000 inhabitants/year and in Brazil an estimated incidence of 0.6 cases/1000&#xD;
      inhabitants/year has been estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk factors for DVT include: advanced age, history of immobilization or prolonged bed rest&#xD;
      during hospitalization, obesity, smoking, recent surgery, previous VTE episodes, cancer,&#xD;
      major or lower limb trauma, cancer therapy, acute infectious disease, heart failure,&#xD;
      respiratory insufficiency, contraceptive use or hormone replacement therapy, pregnancy or&#xD;
      postpartum, stroke with motor deficit, family history of VTE (thrombophilia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical diagnosis of DVT, based on physical examination only, is imprecise and&#xD;
      insensitive and only one-third or less of the clinical suspicions are confirmed by imaging&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goals of DVT treatment are to prevent and / or treat their complications.&#xD;
      Anticoagulant therapy is efficacious but associated to some risk of bleeding. Mechanical&#xD;
      prophylactic measures (ambulation and use of elastic stockings with gradual compression) are&#xD;
      important in high risk patients and in cases with contraindication of anticoagulants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although well known, epidemiological data on this disease may have some particularities&#xD;
      related to geographic regions. Data from registries in USA and Europe has shown some&#xD;
      differences in demographic profile, risk factors and treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few epidemiological data regarding real world panorama of this disease in South America and&#xD;
      Brazil is available in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, the objective of this was to evaluate demographic data, diagnostic methods and and&#xD;
      treatment of deep vein thrombosis in the real world in public university hospitals in Brazil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Population of patients The Registries of the Universities Hospitals (RHEUNI) in Brazil&#xD;
           have been registry consecutive patients with deep venous thrombosis that was started on&#xD;
           July 2013, with a prospective collection of epidemiological data of patients referred to&#xD;
           five public university hospitals in the state of São Paulo (Base Hospital of São José do&#xD;
           Rio Preto Medical School , Clinics Hospital Ribeirão Preto Medical School of São Paulo&#xD;
           University, Clinics Hospital of Campinas University, Clinics Hospital of Botucatu&#xD;
           Medical School of the Paulista State University, Clinics Hospital of Marília Medical&#xD;
           School). This study was approved in the ethics committees of all institutions. An&#xD;
           informed consent form was signed by the patient after explaining the purpose of the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Inclusion criteria are as follows: patients with venous thrombosis in any site, male or&#xD;
           female, regardless of age, with first episode or recurrent episodes and with or without&#xD;
           pulmonary embolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
           There are no exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients registration Patients has been performed in planned digital spreadsheets and&#xD;
           loaded in a computer program for statistical analysis (Epi-Info). Every single completed&#xD;
           worksheets will be exported to Excel worksheet for statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The main outcomes to be reviewed are: demographic characteristics (age, sex and color),&#xD;
           main risk factors for DVT and time of clinical history collected from consecutive&#xD;
           patients referred for those Hospitals. The main symptoms and signs reported by patients,&#xD;
           the sectors affected by thrombosis, as well as the diagnostic tools employed were&#xD;
           registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Worksheet form The recorded characteristics and backgrounds of patients with venous&#xD;
           thrombosis include: age, gender, and main clinics or surgical risk factors. In addition,&#xD;
           the main signs and symptoms and the sectors affected by thrombosis will be reported, and&#xD;
           the diagnostic tools employed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The use of various anticoagulants for the treatment of venous thrombosis and&#xD;
           complications related mainly to bleeding will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Responsibilities of researchers and institutions The principal investigators and&#xD;
           co-participants are committed to maintain the project along time with accurate&#xD;
           information and to participate in quarterly meetings of the RHEUNI group to analyze the&#xD;
           progress of the project and to publish the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The project has no external financial support and there is no conflicts of interest of&#xD;
           any researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Statistical analysis The analyzes will include the sociodemographic characteristics of&#xD;
           patients with deep venous thrombosis. The projected number of cases during the study&#xD;
           period is approximately 800 patients. All analyzes will be conducted using Microsoft&#xD;
           Excel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the demographic data and the most common clinical&#xD;
      characteristics of patients with deep venous thrombosis in public hospitals, their main&#xD;
      predisposing factors, the most commonly used diagnostic tests and the treatments performed.&#xD;
      The participating hospitals have common characteristics: they are large public university&#xD;
      hospitals with a significant number of patients hospitalized and trained by new angiologists&#xD;
      and vascular surgeons in the Sao Paulo State. This study will represent a significant sample&#xD;
      of deep venous thrombosis and its main risk factors and treatments performed so that this&#xD;
      disease can be prevented in some hospital and post-discharge situations in an attempt to&#xD;
      reduce its incidence. Treatment in our real world in most cases is not possible to be&#xD;
      performed outpatient initially due to socio-economic conditions of patients and difficulty in&#xD;
      acquiring the new oral anticoagulants.&#xD;

Description:&#xD;
Anticoagulation.&#xD;
Unfractionated heparin, which is given into a vein (intravenously) - This may be the preferred choice in certain circumstances, such as if the patient has severe kidney failure or unstable blood pressure.&#xD;
Direct oral anticoagulants - These are available in pill form; they include rivaroxaban (brand name: Xarelto) and apixaban (brand name: Eliquis).&#xD;
The choice of anticoagulant depends upon multiple factors, including the preference of the patient and the healthcare provider, the patient's medical history and other conditions, and cost considerations.</description>
