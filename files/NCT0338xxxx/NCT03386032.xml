  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to investigate the clinical effectiveness of the Sponsor's experimental cream&#xD;
      treatment on eczema as measured by visual grading of SCORAD (scoring of atopic dermatitis).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a 9-week, randomized, double blind, parallel comparison study consisting of a&#xD;
      1-week washout phase followed by an 8-week treatment phase. This study will be executed by&#xD;
      one clinical research company utilizing two test sites and up to 62 subjects with moderate or&#xD;
      severe atopic dermatitis, ages 12-65, will be enrolled. Subjects that are enrolled will be&#xD;
      placed on one of three products (e.g. Sponsor's Experimental Cream Treatment, a basic&#xD;
      moisturizer, or a positive control - Desonide) and will be required to use the assigned&#xD;
      product twice a day for the duration of the 8-week treatment phase.&#xD;

    <description>SCORAD (Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis) Change from Baseline to Week 8 of atopic dermatitis lesion as measured by the Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD). SCORAD is a composite severity index comprising a) the amount/extent of body area affected; b)b) 2 subjective symptom of pruritus (10 pts VAS) and sleep disturbance measured (10 pts VAS); and c) 6 disease intensity assessments [Dryness/Scaling, Erythema, Excoriation, Induration/Papulation, Lichenification and Oozing/ Weeping/Crusting, each graded in 3pts TIS from 0 (None) to 3 (Severe). A SCORAD score ranges from 0 (No AD present) to 103&#xD;

          <title>SCORAD</title>
          <description>SCORAD (Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis) is a composite severity index comprising:&#xD;
Extent (a) of body area affected [graded 0-100];&#xD;
Objective (b) assessments on the intensity of symptoms of Dryness/Scaling, Erythema, Excoriation, Induration/Papulation, Lichenification and Oozing/Weeping/Crusting, [each graded from 0 (None) to 3 (Severe)]&#xD;
Subjective (c) assessment of Itch and Sleep Disturbance, graded via 10 pt visual analog assessments&#xD;
SCORAD is calculated as a/5 + 3.5*b + c, with totals ranging from 0 (No Atopic Dermatitis) to 103 (Severe). A Lower SCORAD # is Better.</description>
