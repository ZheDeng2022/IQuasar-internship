  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging is often associated with pathological pathway such as in Mild Cognitive Impairment&#xD;
      (MCI), and that pathway may be associated to a high risk of dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tools for early identification of functional and cognitive decline and effectiveness of&#xD;
      treatments in counteracting the loss of functionality to preserve MCI subjects autonomy, have&#xD;
      been widely debated in recent years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In literature, the importance of combined cognitive and physical training is also recognized&#xD;
      (Karssemeijer E, 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moving from the above mentioned findings and considerations, the aim of GOAL project is to&#xD;
      test a newly developed tele-rehabilitation platform to monitor and preserve functional and&#xD;
      cognitive abilities in individuals affected by Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled and randomly assigned to the tele-rehabilitation (GOAL group)&#xD;
      or usual care program (control group). A dedicated application will be developed for the GOAL&#xD;
      group. Thanks to the application, the participant will access different contents, such as&#xD;
      serious games to train cognitive abilities (Anguera et al,2013) and physical training video&#xD;
      lessons to endorse daily activity. Each participant of GOAL group will be provided with a&#xD;
      tablet, with the application installed on it, and an internet connection (if needed).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      30 patients will be allocated in the treatment arm (Telerehabilitation program, GOAL group)&#xD;
      by randomization. Randomization will be applied with a ratio of 1:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Telerehabilitation program is conceived as a combined protocol to train both cognitive&#xD;
      and physical domains. Participants will be requested to perform the cognitive training three&#xD;
      times weekly and physical training two times weekly, on alternate days. The subject will&#xD;
      access the Telerehabilitation contents by using a web application configured on a touchscreen&#xD;
      notebook, that will be provided to each participant by the research institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exercises are going to be chosen according to adaptive physical activity model, and&#xD;
      each session will be made up of eleven exercises, divided in three categories: warm-up,&#xD;
      strengthening and stretching/relaxation. The participants will perform the exercises&#xD;
      according to instructions received in a sequence of videos. Every session will last 30&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive training will be based on BrainHQ exercises (BrainHQ, Posit Science,USA) which are&#xD;
      characterized by adaptive control of the difficulty levels. The chosen exercises aim to train&#xD;
      different cognitive domains including: attention, executive function, memory, processing&#xD;
      speed, reasoning, and visuospatial memory. Each session will last 20 minutes, and will&#xD;
      include four different types of exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While enrolled in the 8 weeks program, participants will also be requested to wear an&#xD;
      actigraph. The actigraph will be placed on the non-dominant arm and will be used to monitor&#xD;
      daily activity and sleep quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the tele-rehabilitation program, participants will undergo a final assessment.&#xD;
