  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The congestive heart failure (HF) is a condition associated with substantial morbidity,&#xD;
      mortality, and high healthcare expenditures. From the pathophysiological standpoint, several&#xD;
      mechanisms contribute to the progression and dysfunction of the failing heart such as an&#xD;
      increased hemodynamic overload, impaired myocyte calcium cycling, upregulated apoptotic&#xD;
      activity, deficient or increased production of extracellular matrix, genetic predilections&#xD;
      and, finally, excessive neurohumoral stimulation. The vasoactive neurohumoral systems such as&#xD;
      sympathetic nervous system, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and arginine&#xD;
      vasopressin (AVP) system all play a role in maintaining volume and circulatory homeostasis in&#xD;
      the situation of impaired cardiac output.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Catestatin (CST), on another hand, is a novel endogenous peptide cleaved from chromogranin A&#xD;
      (CgA) that is involved in the regulation of cardiac function and arterial blood pressure. The&#xD;
      role of this peptide is to elicit potent catecholamine release-inhibitory activity by acting&#xD;
      at the level of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Therefore, the main hypothesis of this&#xD;
      study is that the observed serum CST levels will reflect the degree of neurohormonal&#xD;
      activation in HF, showing a significant relationship with the degree of disease severity as&#xD;
      measured by relevant functional classifications (such as NYHA class and/or similar).&#xD;
      Secondly, investigators expect to detect correlation of catestatin serum levels with the&#xD;
      established risk stratification scores in HF and with the echocardiographic parameters of the&#xD;
      ventricular function, both in terms of systolic and diastolic cardiac function. Parameters of&#xD;
      inflammation, NT-proBNP, hs-cTnI, renal function parameters, and basic&#xD;
      hematologic/biochemistry indices from peripheral blood will also be obtained and analyzed for&#xD;
      all study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, according to the latest European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic HF, participants with established congestive HF&#xD;
      and the whole spectrum of left ventricular ejection fractions ranging from &lt;40% to ≥50% will&#xD;
      be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, all echocardiographic and laboratory parameters obtained from peripheral blood will&#xD;
      be recorded and compared with respective healthy and matched control participants while&#xD;
      participants diagnosed with HF will additionally be analyzed for potential differences&#xD;
      between subgroups of interest.&#xD;

    <description>The goal is to determine and compare serum catestatin levels in patients with congestive heart failure, stratified by the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in three groups: reduced, mid-range, and preserved ejection fraction (HFrEF, HFmrEF, HFpEF). Furthermore, catestatin plasma levels will be compared between patients with congestive heart failure and healthy volunteers.</description>
