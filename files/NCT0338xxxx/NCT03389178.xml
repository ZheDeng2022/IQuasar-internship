  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators´ main hypothesis is that prenatal stress (PS)- induced programming during&#xD;
      fetal and postnatal development is reflected in epigenetic and autonomic nervous system (ANS)&#xD;
      biomarkers which can be harnessed for early detection and follow-up of affected children. By&#xD;
      integrating multiple non-invasively obtainable sources of information using novel epigenetic,&#xD;
      electrophysiologic and statistical approaches, the trial could yield progress in&#xD;
      maternal-fetal medicine, offering a more precise and truly personalized prediction and new&#xD;
      possibilities for designing interventions to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes of pregnancy&#xD;
      affected by PS.&#xD;

      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cohort of the population of women attending the center of perinatology at the Department of&#xD;
      Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Klinikum rechts der Isar of the Technische Universität&#xD;
      München (TUM) for having birth will fall in the group of persons with higher perceived stress&#xD;
      levels that might concomitantly carry fetuses that show altered sympathetic and vagal&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Klinikum&#xD;
      rechts der Isar of the Technische Universität München (TUM) a tertiary center of Perinatology&#xD;
      of high complexity located in Munich, Germany and that serves about 2000 mothers/newborns per&#xD;
      year. TUM obstetricians will identify prospective subjects according with the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria of the study, consistent on singleton pregnant women between 18 to 45 years of age&#xD;
      in their third trimester (at least 28 weeks gestation) and without a) serious placental&#xD;
      alterations; b) fetal malformations; c) maternal severe illness during pregnancy (i.e.&#xD;
      preclampsia), d) maternal drug or alcohol abuse, e) preterm birth (less than 37 weeks) and f)&#xD;
      Cord blood pH&lt;7,10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective participants will be referred to attend an informational session, when procedures&#xD;
      will be explained, formal enrollment will be completed and the consent forms from the&#xD;
      participants themselves and parental consent for their infants will be obtained. These&#xD;
      protocols are in strict accordance with the Committee of Ethical Principles for Medical&#xD;
      Research from TUM and has the approval of the Ethics Committee of the Hospital &quot; Klinikum&#xD;
      rechts der Isar&quot;. Upon acceptance participants will enter to Phase I-IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this initial stage, the investigators will collect demographic information from consented&#xD;
      women and participants will be categorized as stressed or controls after scoring the Cohen&#xD;
      Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10). This questionnaire measures the degree to which&#xD;
      situations in one's life are appraised as stressful and is a widely used psychological&#xD;
      instrument to measure nonspecific perceived stress. The PSS predicts objective biological&#xD;
      markers of stress and increased risk for disease among persons with higher perceived stress&#xD;
      levels. In particular, PSS scores were used to relate prenatal stress, anxiety, and&#xD;
      depressive symptoms as predictors of intention to breastfeed and to examine correlates of&#xD;
      perceived stress in pregnant women. Increased maternal prenatal stress, measured as PSS and&#xD;
      anxiety, was associated with temperamental variation of young infants and may represent a&#xD;
      risk factor for psychopathology later in life. The PSS-10 has been validated in German&#xD;
      speaking populations and will be a quick tool for screening stress among prospective&#xD;
      subjects. For the purposes of the current study, a participant with a PSS-10 score ≥19 will&#xD;
      be categorized as stressed and entered into Phase II. For every consented subject categorized&#xD;
      as stressed, the next screened participant matching for maternal and gestational age with a&#xD;
      PSS-10 score &lt; 19 will be entered into Phase II as control. Recruitment will continue until&#xD;
      reaching the aimed cohort of n=75 subjects/group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: Maternal psychological evaluation and fetal prenatal recordings:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Questionnaires: In the context enrolled participants entering this phase will be asked&#xD;
           to complete a widely used and validated self-rating questionnaire in order to assess&#xD;
           concerns related to pregnancy. The participants will have to complete the Prenatal&#xD;
           Distress Questionnaire (PDQ-12) designed to assess specific worries and concerns&#xD;
           pertaining to pregnancy and includes items on concerns regarding medical problems,&#xD;
           physical symptoms, parenting, relationships, bodily changes, labour and delivery, and&#xD;
           the health of the baby. This instrument has been previously applied in numerous studies&#xD;
           involving pregnant women from diverse cultural and socio-economic backgrounds and is an&#xD;
           effective instrument to assess pregnancy related stress. PDQ-12 has been translated into&#xD;
           German and was validated. Additionally participants will fill in a questionnaire about&#xD;
           their education level, socio-economic situation, ethnicity and clinical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ANS assessment: During the same visit the fetal heart rate (FHR) will be measured by a&#xD;
           routine cardiotocography (CTG) and simultaneously by transabdominal electrocardiography&#xD;
           (transabdominal-fetal ECG). The electrophysiological signal contains the maternal ECG&#xD;
           (mECG), fetal ECG (fECG) and noise, it will be recorded using 5 disposable electrodes.&#xD;
           The five disposable electrodes will be placed on the maternal abdomen in a standardized&#xD;
           manner. Before placing the electrodes, skin impedance will be reduced by using abrading&#xD;
           paper at the electrode placement site. Data will be analyzed off line after computer&#xD;
           download. For the case that signal loss is high with fECG method, which is a known&#xD;
           problem (more frequent between 28 to 32 gestational weeks, but also might occur after&#xD;
           that period), conventional external CTG will be performed simultaneous using an&#xD;
           ultrasound transducer placed on the maternal Abdomen. The investigators will analyze the&#xD;
           impact of PS on ANS activity by deploying advanced methods of FHR monitoring:&#xD;
           phase-rectified signal averaging (PRSA), multidimensional FHR variability analysis and&#xD;
           assessment of maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization FECG registrations as well as&#xD;
           CTG registrations will be performed once during pregnancy for at least 40 minutes to get&#xD;
           fetal activity status. During labour conventional CTG and if possible fECG and mECG will&#xD;
           be performed simultaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase III: Delivery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Maternal cortisol assessment: Cortisol, the hormonal product of activation of the&#xD;
           hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis has been suggested as a potential mechanism&#xD;
           linking maternal stress and perinatal outcome. Single blood and /or saliva samples&#xD;
           provides a measure at a single point in time and considering its major physiological&#xD;
           daily fluctuations, may not be the most informative measure to evaluate overall or long&#xD;
           term HPA activity during the prenatal period. Recently, the use of hair cortisol&#xD;
           measurements demonstrated that it provides a retrospective index of integrated cortisol&#xD;
           secretion over periods of several months . It is postulated that cortisol is&#xD;
           incorporated into the emerging hair and slowly grow with it. Therefore the amount of&#xD;
           cortisol in a particular hair segment is assumed to reflect the integrated systemic&#xD;
           steroid hormone concentration over a growth period of a specific hair segment. Hair and&#xD;
           salivary cortisol are highly correlated in non-human primates and it has been&#xD;
           demonstrated increased hair cortisol concentrations in pregnant women. Therefore, hair&#xD;
           cortisol has the potential to serve as an integrated measure of HPA activity over an&#xD;
           extended period of time of up to 3-6 months. On the day of parturition, hair strands (~3&#xD;
           mm diameter) will be collected from the posterior vertex region on the head as close to&#xD;
           the scalp as possible as recommended by the Society of Hair Testing (Soc of Hair&#xD;
           testing, 1997). Based on an approximate hair growth rate of 1 cm per month, the proximal&#xD;
           3 cm long hair segment is assumed to reflect the integrated hormone secretion over the&#xD;
           three-month-period prior to sampling. The 3 cm hair sample will be wrapped in aluminum&#xD;
           foil for protection and stored at room temperature. Hair samples will be sent for&#xD;
           cortisol determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Maternal blood collection (not part of this study- blood will be stored at the biobank):&#xD;
           A maximum of 20 ml will be collected to provide serum and plasma specimens. The blood&#xD;
           specimens will be stored in 2-4 x 1.8 ml labelled Cryotube vials after one&#xD;
           centrifugation cycle for serum specimens (2750 rpm x 10 min at RT) and stored at -80 °C&#xD;
           and after 10 gentle invertions for plasma specimens and stored at -20 °C. The blood&#xD;
           samples will be processed and frozen within 2-4 h. The time interval between collection&#xD;
           and freezing will be recorded for all specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cord Blood samples: Once the baby is delivered and before placental separation, the cord&#xD;
           is clamped and cord blood samples will be drawn and distributed in two tubes for serum&#xD;
           and plasma specimens following the same procedure as detailed above. A third sample will&#xD;
           be collected in a PAXgene tube, carefully inverted 10 times and left at RT for 5 hs in&#xD;
           an upright position. The tubes will then be stored at -80 °C after 10-16 hs at -20 °C.&#xD;
           (the PAXgene sample is not part of this study- blood will be stored at the biobank)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Placenta samples (not part of this study- samples will be stored at the biobank): Once&#xD;
           the placenta is delivered the maternal side will be dissected. Two biopsies will be&#xD;
           taken (approximately 1 cm³) avoiding decidua contamination. The samples are placed in&#xD;
           Cryotube vials and stored immediately at -20 °C.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Newborn recordings: Soon after birth, a neonatal specialized midwife will collect a&#xD;
           saliva/buccal samples from the newborns by gentle rubbing the gums on both sides with&#xD;
           the sponge of the Oracollect-DNA kit (DNA Genotek, Canada) and stored at RT. Clinical&#xD;
           data including body metrics pH and APGAR score, will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase IV: Postnatal recordings:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following up on the cohort recruited at phase I and mirroring the neurodevelopmental animal&#xD;
      study, we will perform a longitudinal study to explore the feasibility of measuring&#xD;
      biomarkers of PS-induced epigenetic reprogramming.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Infant developmental assessment: In the final stage of the study, the mother will be&#xD;
           asked to complete a final questionnaire to assess postpartum depression and breast&#xD;
           feeding that she will receive by mail post. While the current study is focused on&#xD;
           antenatal events, early postnatal care is heavily impacted by maternal depression and&#xD;
           can alter the epigenetic reprogramming of the infant brain. Therefore, the level of&#xD;
           maternal involvement in childcare during the first months could directly affect the&#xD;
           methylation status and will be recorded. Mothers will be asked about feeding and care&#xD;
           routines to complete the postnatal-care assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Infants' cognitive development will be assessed by Bayley Scale III of Infant&#xD;
           development (BSID) at 18 months of age. The BSID is composed by a series of tests aimed&#xD;
           at evaluating cognitive, motor and behavioral development on infants from age 0-3 years.&#xD;
           The Mental Development Index and the Psychomotor Development Index components have a&#xD;
           mean score of 100 and a standard deviation of 15 (range of 55 to 145). Scores between&#xD;
           70-84 indicate mildly delayed performance, and scores ≤ 69 indicate significantly&#xD;
           delayed performance. Approximately 13.5 % of tested infants are expected to fall in&#xD;
           those categories. Maternal psychological distress during pregnancy was associated in a&#xD;
           dose-response manner with BSID scores in 2 years-old children. A specialized&#xD;
           Psychologist, who will be blind regarding maternal stress categorization, will&#xD;
           administer the tests, which will last about 40 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A new saliva sample will be collected from the infants at this final visit. The&#xD;
           biomarkers will be quantified from salivary DNA obtained from the young infants. ECG&#xD;
           will be measured for ANS assessment. Methylation levels will be correlated with maternal&#xD;
           stress, depression and anxiety, with infant's cognitive development and ANS capacity to&#xD;
           assess the efficacy of these novel biomarkers.&#xD;
