  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of propranolol hydrochloride&#xD;
      when given together with pembrolizumab and how well they work in treating patients with stage&#xD;
      IIIC-IV melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery. Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      that &quot;takes the brakes off the immune system&quot; and thus allows for anti-tumor immune&#xD;
      responses. Propranolol hydrochloride is a beta adrenergic blocking agent that can enhance&#xD;
      immune cell responses when under stress. Giving propranolol hydrochloride and pembrolizumab&#xD;
      may work better in treating patients with melanoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of propranolol hydrochloride (propranolol) in&#xD;
      combination with fixed dose pembrolizumab in the treatment of melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the efficacy of pembrolizumab in combination with propranolol in patients&#xD;
      with melanoma, as determined by overall response rate (ORR) per immune-modified Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the efficacy of pembrolizumab in combination with propranolol in patients with&#xD;
      melanoma, as determined by secondary measures of efficacy, including: progression free&#xD;
      survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To correlate baseline or changes in the levels of biomarkers, like, peripheral T-cell&#xD;
      subsets/myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC)/cytokines/urinary catecholamine and perceived&#xD;
      stress scale (PSS) with efficacy (ORR, PFS, OS) in melanoma patients treated with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab and propranolol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation study of propranolol hydrochloride followed by a&#xD;
      phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive propranolol hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and pembrolizumab&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes of day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks for up to 2 years&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for&#xD;
      6 months, and then every 6 months thereafter.&#xD;
