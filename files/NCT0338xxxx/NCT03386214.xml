  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the investigators' preclinical data, the combination of pevonedistat and ruxolitinib&#xD;
      may provide greater clinical responses in patients with myelofibrosis compared to ruxolitinib&#xD;
      monotherapy via inhibition of NFκB in addition to JAK-STAT signaling.&#xD;
