  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, observer-blinded, multicenter, dose-escalation Phase 1 clinical study&#xD;
      investigating three dose levels of VLA1553 after a single immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      120 study participants will be enrolled into the study to receive three different doses (30&#xD;
      subjects in the low and medium and 60 subjects in the high dose group). Vaccination will be&#xD;
      given intramuscularly on Day 0. As safety precaution, the study will begin with enrolment of&#xD;
      20 sentinel subjects in an open-label fashion. Thereafter, subjects will be enrolled in a&#xD;
      blinded, randomized manner in the three study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A re-vaccination will be given at Month 6 or Month 12 to confirm that a single vaccination&#xD;
      will be sufficient to induce high titer neutralizing antibodies and protect subjects from&#xD;
      CHIKV viremia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be followed up until 13 months after initial vaccination.&#xD;
