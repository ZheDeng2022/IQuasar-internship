    <textblock>
      Accelerated AC regimen-Doxorubicin 60 mg/m2,Cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 on day 1 &amp; day 14 of&#xD;
      each cycle along with G-CSF support for up to 4 cycles, followed by Paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 in&#xD;
      the next 4 cycles is the standard clinical practice in Vietnam for breast cancer, this&#xD;
      regimen is to facilitate the dose-dense schedule, patients receive every-2-week therapy along&#xD;
      with G-CSF support. the accelerated dose-dense schedule improve disease-free and overall&#xD;
      survival among women with breast cancer .Primary objective of this study is to compare the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of Nanogen's Pegcyte and Roche's Neulastim for prevention of chemotherapy&#xD;
      (Accelerated AC regimen)-induced neutropenia on breast cancer patients. Breast cancer&#xD;
      patients scheduled to receive myelosuppressive chemotherapy (AC regimen) will be recruited in&#xD;
      this trial. All eligible patients receive single subcutaneous injection of study drugs 24&#xD;
      hours after chemotherapy administration in each cycle for 3 consecutive cycles. Efficacy and&#xD;
      safety assessments will be assessed based on the incidence of severe neutropenia in&#xD;
      combination of temperature &gt; 38.3℃ or sepsis or life threatening infection and incidence of&#xD;
      serious adverse events.&#xD;
