  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to describe the baseline rate of safe firearm storage device use in the homes&#xD;
      of pediatric patients with mental health complaints treated in the Emergency Department (ED)&#xD;
      and/or inpatient psychiatric unit of an urban tertiary pediatric hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up data will be collected to ascertain any change(s) in the rate of safe firearm&#xD;
      storage device use after patients have been treated for a mental health complaint, which&#xD;
      includes standardized recommendations for safe firearm storage practices. This study also&#xD;
      involves an intervention to distribute safe firearm storage devices to families of pediatric&#xD;
      mental health patients during their hospital visit, and assesses whether safe storage device&#xD;
      distribution impacts reported future rate of firearm safety device use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Firearm injuries are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality for children and teens.&#xD;
      Access to firearms has been associated with suicide completion in the pediatric mental health&#xD;
      population. Current practice in our pediatric Emergency Department (ED) and inpatient&#xD;
      psychiatric unit is to screen all mental health patients for firearm access, and to recommend&#xD;
      safe firearm storage practices. However, there is no data on the baseline rate of safe&#xD;
      firearm storage device use in the homes of these patients, or on the effectiveness of&#xD;
      providing these recommendations during hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has two phases, a baseline and an intervention. During the baseline phase, the&#xD;
      research team will study whether there is an improvement in safe firearm storage device use&#xD;
      in the homes of participants 7 or 30 days after safe storage practices are recommended during&#xD;
      an ED or inpatient psychiatric visit. During the intervention phase, in addition to the&#xD;
      standard recommendation of safe storage practices during the visit, the research team will&#xD;
      distribute firearm safety storage devices such as a lock box, trigger lock, and and/or cable&#xD;
      lock to families at the time of study enrollment. The investigators will study whether there&#xD;
      is an improvement in safe firearm storage device use in the homes of intervention&#xD;
      participants after 7 or 30 days compared to the usual care group.&#xD;
