  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies whether using high throughput drug sensitivity and genomics&#xD;
      data is feasible in developing individualized treatment in patients with multiple myeloma or&#xD;
      plasma cell leukemia that has come back or does not respond to treatment. High throughput&#xD;
      screen tests many different drugs that kill multiple myeloma cells in individual chambers at&#xD;
      the same time. Matching a drug or drug combination to a patient using high throughput screen&#xD;
      and genetic information may improve the ability to help patients by choosing drugs that work&#xD;
      well for their disease.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the frequency of obtaining an actionable result from the assay and to estimate&#xD;
      feasibility as defined as a frequency of at least 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To test patient cells in a high-throughput assay against individual drugs and drug&#xD;
      combinations within 21 days, to enable optimal choice of drug combinations for therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the response rate among patients treated after physicians are presented with the&#xD;
      testing results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo collection of bone marrow aspirate and blood for high-throughput drug&#xD;
      sensitivity assay and mutational analysis using next generation sequencing. Patients and&#xD;
      their treating physicians receive the results of the tests. Treatment decisions are then made&#xD;
      by the patients and their treating physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.&#xD;
