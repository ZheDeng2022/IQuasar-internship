  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autologous cellular immunotherapy is to collect patient's own immune cells and infuse back&#xD;
      into the patient's body after culture in vitro that can activate the anti-tumor immune&#xD;
      response and achieve the purpose of cancer treatment. Central memory T (Tcm) cells are&#xD;
      effective anti-tumor immune cells with long-term in vivo survival and self-renewal capacity.&#xD;
      Combination of autologous Tcm cells immunotherapy with other therapies, such as surgery and&#xD;
      chemotherapy, can effectively prolong the patient's life, prevent the recurrence and&#xD;
      metastasis of cancers, and improve the quality of life of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will recruit patients with pathologically and radiographically confirmed&#xD;
      metastatic bladder urothelial carcinoma that the efficacy is evaluated as partial response&#xD;
      (PR) or complete response (CR) after 4 cycles of the standard first-line gemcitabine plus&#xD;
      cisplatin chemotherapy. Patients must have adequate hematologic and end-organ function,&#xD;
      performance status and no contraindications to receive autologous Tcm cells immunotherapy.&#xD;
      All participants will be treated with standard first-line gemcitabine plus cisplatin&#xD;
      chemotherapy before enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial was designed with a single-center randomized controlled trial. The study&#xD;
      will recruit 56 patients that will be divided into treatment group and control group as 1:1&#xD;
      according to the randomization. Patients of treatment group will be treated with twice&#xD;
      autologous Tcm cells immunotherapy after chemotherapy. These patients will be infused in&#xD;
      2-4×10^9 cells/100 ml after chemotherapy for 1 month, then cells will be infused as the same&#xD;
      dose after another month. All patients will be followed up with hospital visits and telephone&#xD;
      interviews to second-line treatment for disease progression. The observation period of&#xD;
      patients is 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of autologous Tcm&#xD;
      cells immunotherapy in patients with metastatic bladder epithelial carcinoma treated with&#xD;
      first-line gemcitabine plus cisplatin according to the progression-free survival (PFS) and&#xD;
      overall survival (OS) of these patients.&#xD;
