      The pilot study has two objectives: 1) to assess the post-infusion viability of INTERCEPT RBC&#xD;
      by measuring the 24 hour post-infusion recovery (&quot;PTR24&quot;) and lifespan of autologous RBCs&#xD;
      prepared with the INTERCEPT System for RBC after storage for 35 days under standard blood&#xD;
      banking conditions using two different RBC labels; 51-chromium and biotin. The control will&#xD;
      be conventional untreated RBCs stored for 35 days; and 2) comparison and contrast of PTR24&#xD;
      and lifespan results of the 51-chromium and biotin labeling methods of RBC stored for 35 days&#xD;
      under standard blood banking conditions. The purpose of gathering these data is to obtain&#xD;
      more meaningful survival data for stored conventional and INTERCEPT RBCs over the entire 120&#xD;
      d RBC lifespan (51-Cr labeled RBC permits a maximum 28 d assessment as a result of 51-Cr's&#xD;
      variable, progressive elution from RBC and radioactive half-life).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Each subject will receive one infusion of autologous, radiolabeled and BioRBC labeled&#xD;
      INTERCEPT RBCs (Test RBCs) and one infusion of autologous BioRBC labeled untreated RBCs&#xD;
      (Control RBCs) concomitantly. Each infusion will be approximately 20 mL, i.e., 10 mL of&#xD;
      51-chromium labeled RBC, and 10 mL of either BioRBC-6 or BioRBC-18 which will be stratified&#xD;
      as indicated above based on the Test or Control designation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Compliance Healthy subjects who understand the study commitments and sign the&#xD;
      informed consent will be enrolled in the study. Treatment compliance and follow-up testing&#xD;
      will be tracked by the Investigator, recorded on the case report form (CRF), and monitored by&#xD;
      the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy Parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy endpoints include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Efficacy Endpoint(24)&#xD;
&#xD;
      - 24 hour post-infusion recovery of autologous RBC stored in AS-5 for 35 days and then&#xD;
      labeled with either 51Cr or biotin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Efficacy Endpoints(25)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mean lifespan of autologous RBC stored for 35 days and then labeled with either 51Cr or&#xD;
           biotin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Median lifespan (T50) of autologous RBC stored for 35 days and then labeled with either&#xD;
           51Cr or biotin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Area under the curve (AUC) determined using data points collected forRBC lifespan of&#xD;
           autologous, radiolabeled or BioRBCs&#xD;
&#xD;
           e) Dose determination and duration&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Timing of Efficacy Parameters This study consists of a single treatment period&#xD;
      where Control biotinylated (using a RBC surface density of 6 or 18 mcg of sulfo-NHS-biotin&#xD;
      per mL RBC) are administered, i.e., co-infused at a single point in time with Test&#xD;
      INTERCEPT-treated biotinylated RBC (using a concentration of 18 or 6 mcg of sulfo-NHS-biotin&#xD;
      per mL RBC) and INTERCEPT-treated, radiolabeled (51Cr) RBC. All 6 subjects will receive both&#xD;
      control and S-303-treated (test) RBCs concomitantly and the only difference between the two&#xD;
      sets of 3 subjects will be the level of biotinylation of the control or test RBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is stratified and control or test RBC will be labeled alternatively with either 6&#xD;
      or 18 mcg of sulfo-NHS-biotin per mL RBC. RBC from three individuals (subjects 1, 3 and 5)&#xD;
      will be labeled with 6 and 18 mcg of sulfo-NHS-biotin per mL RBC for control and test RBC,&#xD;
      respectively. Other three individuals (subjects 2, 4 and 6) will be labeled with 6 and 18 mcg&#xD;
      of sulfo-NHS-biotin per mL RBC for Control and Test RBC, respectively. The objective of this&#xD;
      stratification is to ensure that no bias is introduced by the biotin label density into one&#xD;
      of the arms of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      f) Description of observations and measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 0 of each treatment period the subject will donate two units of packed RBC (double RBC&#xD;
      automatized donation, Trima - Terumo BCT apheresis system); the units will be leukocyte&#xD;
      reduced by in-line filtration and the RBC concentrates will be prepared in additive solution&#xD;
      (AS-5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the two units will be stored immediately at 1-6ÂºC for 35 days (Control unit). This&#xD;
      conventional RBC component represents the Control RBCs in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Test RBC unit will be prepared by processing using the INTERCEPT Blood System for Red&#xD;
      Blood Cells. In vitro biochemical and morphological parameters of the study RBC components&#xD;
      (Table 1) will be measured on Day 0 after preparation of RBC concentrates in AS-5 (prior to&#xD;
      study treatment), post processing and prior to storage (Test only), and again on Day 35&#xD;
      (prior to infusion back in to study subjects) to evaluate the RBC quality of the&#xD;
      processed/stored RBC units. The data collected for the in vitro characteristics will be&#xD;
      summarized using descriptive statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 1. Biochemical parameters analyzed on day 0 and day 35 of storage of control- and&#xD;
      treated RBC units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parameter Hb content/unit Hemolysis pH pO2 pCO2 Glucose (extracellular) Lactate&#xD;
      (extracellular) Bicarbonate (extracellular) Sodium (extracellular) Potassium (extracellular)&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 35 of RBC storage each treatment period, an aliquot of Control RBCs will be&#xD;
      biotinylated (6 or 18 mcg/mL). From the Test unit, two aliquots will be drawn; the first&#xD;
      aliquot will be radiolabeled with 51Cr and the second aliquot will be biotinylated at 6 or 18&#xD;
      mcg/mL. Re-infusion of the two biotinylated autologous RBC (Control and Test) specimens along&#xD;
      with the 51Cr labeled autologous RBC (Test) will measure recovery and survival (approximately&#xD;
      total: 20 mcCi). Also on Day 35, a 20 mL sample of fresh blood will be drawn from the subject&#xD;
      and the RBCs labeled with 99mTc and Bio-54. Re-infusion of the fresh 99mTc RBC and fresh&#xD;
      Bio-54 will allow determination of subject blood volume or number of circulating RBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five types of RBC will be mixed and infused: a) fresh RBC labeled with 99mTc and BioRBC-54;&#xD;
      b) fresh Bio-54 labeled RBC; c) Stored, Control or Test RBC biotinylated at density 6 mcg/mL;&#xD;
      d) Stored, Test or Control RBC biotinylated at density 18 mcg/mL; and, e) Stored, Test, RBC&#xD;
      labeled with 51Cr. All aliquots will be labeled separately and mixed for a volume of ~50 mL.&#xD;
      The 50 mL of autologous RBCs will be infused through a peripheral vein using an 18-19 gauge&#xD;
      butterfly needle (at an approximate rate of 5 mL/min).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples, from the subject's contralateral arm, will be collected immediately&#xD;
      pre-infusion and at 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15, 20, 30 minutes and 24 hours after completion of the&#xD;
      infusion to permit extrapolation to T=0 for 51Cr determination of blood volume as previously&#xD;
      published by our group (16, 17, 26-30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional blood samples will be collected at 48 and 72 hours and 7 days post-infusion, and&#xD;
      then weekly through 28 days (days 37, 38, 42, 49, 56 and 63 post-infusion) and bi-weekly from&#xD;
      then on (days 77, 91, 105, 119, 133, 147). After collection of the final blood sample in&#xD;
      Treatment Period 2, subjects will be discharged from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the study, each of the 6 subjects will have provided 2 units of whole&#xD;
      blood and receive 1 infusion of autologous radiolabeled Test or Control RBCs and 1 infusion&#xD;
      of autologous radiolabeled Control or Test RBCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study assessments used to evaluate both efficacy and safety are presented below (Section&#xD;
      1).&#xD;

&#xD;
           ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY The timing of study safety assessments is presented in the Table.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Safety Parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
           Safety endpoints include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary Safety Endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Incidence of antibody specific to INTERCEPT treated RBCs&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Incidence of antibody specific to biotinylated RBCs Secondary Safety Endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Incidence of adverse and severe adverse events as described below in the section&#xD;
                titled, &quot;Recording and Reporting Adverse Events.&quot; The INTERCEPT Treatment System&#xD;
                medical device will be monitored for device deficiencies, including malfunctions&#xD;
                and adverse device effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Methods and Timing of Safety Parameters In this study, the Sponsor/Investigator, J.A.&#xD;
           Cancelas, will collect and record adverse events (AEs) for 24 hours following collection&#xD;
           of each whole blood unit and for 24 hours following each infusion of study RBCs. Serious&#xD;
           adverse events (SAE) will be collected and recorded from the time the first unit of&#xD;
           whole blood is collected until the completion of the study (Table).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects will be actively monitored for AEs during blood collection and during the study&#xD;
           RBC infusions, and until they are discharged. After discharge, all AEs reported to the&#xD;
           qualified study staff will be recorded. AE and SAE data may be collected by phone or in&#xD;
           person by study staff. Vital signs are collected prior to and following each study&#xD;
           infusion. In the event that a subject develops within 24 hours after a study RBC&#xD;
           transfusion post-infusion fever, defined as a temperature &gt;39Â°C or a temperature &gt;38Â°C&#xD;
           with shaking chills (rigors) or signs and symptoms consistent with bacterial sepsis, the&#xD;
           subject's blood will be cultured and the Blood Center will be notified to culture the&#xD;
           RBCs remaining in a segment or the residual Test or Control RBC components.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Our group will test subject serum or plasma for antibody specific to INTERCEPT RBCs and&#xD;
           BioRBC; these samples will be obtained from each subject pre-infusion, 14 days after&#xD;
           infusion, and 28 days after infusion and monthly thereafter to study day 147 (see&#xD;
           Table). If an antibody specific to INTERCEPT treated RBCs is identified, samples will be&#xD;
           sent to an independent laboratory for confirmation (the UCLA/American Red Cross,&#xD;
           Pomona). Blood samples for hematology and chemistry panels will be obtained from each&#xD;
           subject Study Days: pre-infusion (day 35), 24 hours after the infusion (day 36), 56 days&#xD;
           after infusion (day 91) and 112 days after infusion (day 147, at the end of the study).&#xD;
           Clinically significant laboratory findings will be recorded as adverse events. The&#xD;
           laboratory assessments are identified in the Table 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Transfusion Reactions Although transfusion reactions are unlikely due to the small&#xD;
           infusion volume, clinically significant transfusion reactions will be recorded as&#xD;
           adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Suspected Transfusion Related Sepsis Subjects will be monitored for infusion-related&#xD;
           adverse events including infusion-related sepsis following the study infusion. To&#xD;
           provide an unaltered sample of the blood infusate aliquot transfused into a subject, the&#xD;
           remainder of this aliquot will be sent for bacterial culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the event that a subject develops post-infusion fever, defined as a temperature &gt;39Â°C&#xD;
           or a temperature &gt;38Â°C with shaking chills (rigors) or signs and symptoms consistent&#xD;
           with bacterial sepsis within 24 hours after a study RBC infusion, the subject's blood&#xD;
           will be cultured and the remaining stored component will be cultured.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cultures will be performed by investigators at the Hoxworth Blood Center according to&#xD;
           standard operating procedures at the Hoxworth Blood Center. If bacteria are recovered&#xD;
           from both the patient's blood and the RBC component, samples of the isolates will be&#xD;
           sent to the University of Cincinnati Hospital laboratory to determine if the recovered&#xD;
           organisms are identical. Infusion-induced sepsis will not be established unless the same&#xD;
           organism(s) is recovered from both the RBC component and from the study subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Detection and Confirmation of Antibody Specific to INTERCEPT RBCs Although not&#xD;
           anticipated to occur in this study due to the limited exposure to Test RBC, all subjects&#xD;
           will be tested for the presence of antibody specific to INTERCEPT treated RBC at study&#xD;
           entry (naturally occurring antibody) and at specified times during the study (Table 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The presence of antibody will be evaluated using a formally validated gel card IAT that&#xD;
           is routinely used in many blood centers for transfusion compatibility testing in&#xD;
           conjunction with a panel of frozen reagent INTERCEPT RBCs. The frozen RBC screening&#xD;
           panel is composed of reagent RBCs from 3 specifically phenotyped blood group O donors,&#xD;
           and is analogous to routine antibody screening panels used in regular blood banking&#xD;
           practice. Each cell in the panel of 3 consists of untreated RBCs, cells carrying a&#xD;
           &quot;high&quot; level of acridine adducts and cells carrying a &quot;low&quot; level of acridine adducts.&#xD;
           The screening panel was designed as a sensitive screening test for the presence of&#xD;
           INTERCEPT RBC antibodies in the presence of most common alloantibodies. Gel card&#xD;
           agglutination will be scored 1+ to 4+ based on manufacturer's recommendation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For result interpretation, if the RBC screening panel score is positive with 3/3 of the&#xD;
           INTERCEPT RBCs carrying either 'high&quot; and/or &quot;low&quot; levels of acridine adducts AND with&#xD;
           0/3 with the corresponding Control untreated RBCs the sample is classified as &quot;reactive&#xD;
           for INTERCEPT RBC antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Antibody confirmation and characterization will be performed at the ARC Immunohematology&#xD;
           Reference Laboratory, Pomona and will include acridine specificity by agglutination&#xD;
           inhibition (neutralization) using a soluble acridine analog of amustaline, antibody&#xD;
           titer, antibody isotype and thermal amplitude.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If the presence of antibody specific to INTERCEPT RBC is established, this does not&#xD;
           determine whether that antibody is physiologically active or clinically significant,&#xD;
           this can only be determined by any one of the following criteria indicative of&#xD;
           accelerated RBC clearance in the absence of active bleeding, organ-mediated RBC&#xD;
           sequestration, severe erythroid hypoplasia or other concurrent medical cause for acute&#xD;
           anemia not associated with transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Detection and Confirmation of Antibody Specific to BioRBC As with INTERCEPT RBCs,&#xD;
           subjects will be screened prior to transfusion for the presence of naturally occurring&#xD;
           or pre-existing antibody to BioRBC (18). This will be done using the same gel card&#xD;
           agglutination as for the INTERCEPT RBCs but using BioRBCs incubated with subject serum&#xD;
           or plasma. Briefly, 50 ÂµL of 0.8% hematocrit target BioRBC-N or unlabeled RBC will be&#xD;
           prepared from a blood GpO donor and added to the gel column. Subject plasma (25 ÂµL) is&#xD;
           added to the target RBCs and incubated at 37ËC for 30 min. Gel cards are subsequently&#xD;
           centrifuged for 10 min. The presence of BioRBC agglutination is quantified using the&#xD;
           manufacturer's gradation-specific definitions of reactivity. Reactivity scores will be&#xD;
           based on manufacturers recommendation 0-4+ but, in addition, a score of 1+ (i.e.,&#xD;
           agglutination in lower half of matrix) will be further sub-classified into three&#xD;
           increasingly reactive 1+ designations: 1) Â± indicates a slanted pellet with a few&#xD;
           agglutinated RBC; 2) 1w indicates a slanted pellet with more agglutinated RBC; and 3) 1+&#xD;
           indicates a disrupted RBC pellet with more agglutinated cells. As with the detection of&#xD;
           INTERCEPT-specific antibodies, the detection of specific antibodies to BioRBC does not&#xD;
           determine whether that these antibodies are physiologically active or clinically&#xD;
           significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Confirmatory testing of the induction of BioRBC-induced antibodies will be performed by&#xD;
           agglutination inhibition (neutralization) with biotin compounds, e.g., biocytin,&#xD;
           biotinylated gelatin or biotinylated albumin is able, are able to neutralize anti-BioRBC&#xD;
           antibodies. So far, all identified preexisting, naturally occurring anti-BioRBC&#xD;
           antibodies are neutralized by biotin compounds, while the induced anti-BioRBC antibodies&#xD;
           are expected to be inhibited by BioRBC and not by free biotin as previously published by&#xD;
           our group (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recording and Reporting Adverse Events Adverse Event Definition An AE is defined as any&#xD;
           untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered&#xD;
           a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with&#xD;
           this treatment. An adverse event can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including&#xD;
           an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the&#xD;
           medicinal product (in this study BioRBC and INTERCEPT RBC) whether or not related to the&#xD;
           medicinal product (International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements&#xD;
           for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH-E2A, section 2.1)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Serious Adverse Event Definition&#xD;
&#xD;
           Some AEs are considered &quot;serious&quot; when the outcome of the event poses a threat to a&#xD;
           patient's life or functional status. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE that results&#xD;
           in the following outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Results in death&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Life-threatening&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or&#xD;
                require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate&#xD;
                medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and/or may require intervention&#xD;
                to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition (ICH E2A section II/B).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Adverse Device Effect Definition An Adverse Device Effect (ADE) is defined as an adverse&#xD;
           event related to the use of an investigation medical device.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Unanticipated Adverse Effect Definition An unanticipated adverse effect (UAE) is defined&#xD;
           as any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or&#xD;
           death caused by, or associated with, the process, if that effect, problem, or death was&#xD;
           not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the&#xD;
           investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or&#xD;
           any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the&#xD;
           rights, safety, or welfare of subjects (21 CFR 812.3).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Reporting Adverse Events AEs will be documented on the appropriate case report form&#xD;
           (CRF), regardless of whether or not they are classified as associated with the study&#xD;
           product.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If an AE meets the criteria of a serious adverse event (SAE) or unanticipated adverse&#xD;
           device effect (UAE) as described above, the Sponsor/PI will halt the study and notify&#xD;
           the FDA within 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Investigators will comply with the applicable regulatory requirement(s) related to&#xD;
           the reporting of serious adverse events to the IRB. An Investigator shall submit to the&#xD;
           Sponsor and to the reviewing IRB a report of any unanticipated adverse device effect&#xD;
           occurring during an investigation as soon as possible, but in no event later than 10&#xD;
           working days after the Investigator first learns of the effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Sponsor will report suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions and/or&#xD;
           unanticipated adverse device effects to comply with the applicable regulatory&#xD;
           requirement(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Assessing Seriousness and Severity of an Adverse Event The Investigator is required to&#xD;
           assess if the adverse event is non-serious or serious, the latter is defined as an event&#xD;
           that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening event (results&#xD;
           in an immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred), inpatient&#xD;
           hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant&#xD;
           disability/incapacity, a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or another important medical&#xD;
           event.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The term &quot;severe&quot; is used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as&#xD;
           in mild, moderate, or severe); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor&#xD;
           medical significance (such as severe headache). Severity is not the same as &quot;serious&quot;,&#xD;
           which is based on patient/event outcome or treatment criteria associated with events&#xD;
           that pose a threat to a patient's life or functional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting&#xD;
           obligations. The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse&#xD;
           Events (CTCAE, version 4.03) is used to assess and classify the intensity/severity of an&#xD;
           event.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Assessing Causal Relationship of an Adverse Events The Investigator will assess whether&#xD;
           there is a reasonable possibility that the study blood collection or RBC infusion caused&#xD;
           or contributed to an adverse event.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Determination of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the study RBC component&#xD;
           caused or contributed to an adverse event includes assessing temporal relationships,&#xD;
           biologic plausibility, dechallenge/rechallenge information (if available), association&#xD;
           (or lack of association) with underlying disease, and presence (or absence) of a more&#xD;
           likely cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The scale for assessing the causal relationship of an adverse event to the study RBC&#xD;
           component (imputability levels) follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Causality Assessment Scale Imputability Level Explanation Excluded When there is&#xD;
           conclusive evidence beyond reasonable doubt for attributing the adverse event to&#xD;
           alternative causes. Unlikely When the evidence is clearly in favor of attributing the&#xD;
           adverse event to causes other than the study RBC component.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Possible: When the evidence is indeterminate for attributing adverse event either&#xD;
                to the RBC component or to alternative causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Likely: Probable When the evidence is clearly in favor of attributing the adverse&#xD;
                event to the RBC component.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Certain: When there is conclusive evidence beyond reasonable doubt for attributing&#xD;
                the adverse event to the RBC component.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Assessing Intensity of an Adverse Events The Investigator is required to assess the&#xD;
           intensity (severity) of each adverse event using the National Cancer Institute Common&#xD;
           Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Adverse Event Follow up All SAEs will be followed until resolution, or the Investigator&#xD;
           judges the event to be chronic or stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Stopping Rules&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following SR will be applied to all study subjects throughout the trial whenever&#xD;
           this study's sponsor/PI (JosÃ© Cancelas, M.D., Ph.D.,) and/or Clinical Monitor (Patricia&#xD;
           Carey MD, Professor of Pathology, Medical Director, Hoxworth Blood Center)) agree that&#xD;
           any of the following have occurred:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. An SAE that is determined to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to the&#xD;
                infusion of autologous BioRBC;&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. An AE related to the infusion of autologous BioRBC jeopardizes the subject's health&#xD;
                or safety;&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. An AE requiring medical or surgical intervention related to the infusion of&#xD;
                autologous BioRBC is required to prevent occurrence of an SAE;&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. A post-infusion of hemolysis event as assessed by anti-BioRBC antibody detection&#xD;
                using the IgG gel card assay developed by our group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If any of the above conditions occur, the study will be paused and reported to FDA and&#xD;
           IRB as required by current regulations to assess continuation of the study. Infused&#xD;
           subjects will remain being followed as long as needed to identify the consequences of&#xD;
           the AEs identified. Since there are no additional experimental BioRBC transfusions&#xD;
           administered as part of this study, &quot;continuation of the study&quot; is understood to mean a&#xD;
           continuation of the monitoring of biologic samples as already outlined in this study,&#xD;
           but possibly including other testing as deemed appropriate by the study's sponsor/PI,&#xD;
           Clinical Monitor, FDA and/or IRB.&#xD;
