    <measure>Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)-Related Costs</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months. (At baseline visit (T0), at 6 months visit (T6) and at 12 month visit (T12)).</time_frame>
    <description>The total annual IPF-related costs were obtained as the sum of direct health costs, direct non-health costs and indirect costs. IPF-related costs were quantified for each patient over the follow-up period of 12 months. The direct health and direct non-health costs were calculated as the sum of the costs of medical visits, emergency room visits, hospital admissions, outpatient tests, non-pharmacological treatments and pharmacological treatments and the sum of transport costs, paid caregivers costs, orthopedic material costs, financial aid, and structural changes cost. The indirect costs included number of IPF related days off work and time dedicated to patient care with IPF (informal caregiver). The opportunity cost method was used to calculate informal care costs. The indirect costs were estimated by applying salary costs based on the latest data published by the Spanish Instituto Nacional de Estadística from the salary structure survey, adjusted to age.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life (QoL) of Patients With Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) Through Saint George´s Respiratory Questionaire (SGRQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months. (At baseline visit (T0), at 6 month visit (T6) and at 12 month visit (T12)).</time_frame>
    <description>The Quality of Life of patients with IPF according to Forced Vital Capacity (FVC)% predicted value, is assessed through SGRQ. The SGRQ is a 50-item questionaire developed to quantify the impact of the disease on the health and QoL perceived by patients with respiratory diseases. It consisted of 50 items divided into 3 scales: symptoms (frequency and severity of respiratory symptoms), activity (limitations due to dyspnoea) and impact (psychological and social functioning disorders caused by the disease). The final scores ranged from 0 (best health-related quality of life) to 100 (worse health-related quality of life). The number of participants analysed displays the number of participants with available data at the timepoint of interests.</description>

    <description>The Quality of Life of patients with IPF according to Forced Vital Capacity (FVC)% predicted value is assessed through the Barthel Index.&#xD;
Barthel Index were used to score the ability of a participant to care for himself. It consists of 10 items, the values assigned to each item are based on time and amount of actual physical assistance required if a participant is unable to perform the activity. The final score ranges from 0 and 100. Participant scoring 100 is continent, feeds himself, dresses himself, gets up out of bed and chairs, bathes himself, walks at least a block, and can ascend and descend stairs.&#xD;

    <time_frame>12 months. (At baseline visit (T0), at 6 months visit (T6) at 12 month visit (T12)).</time_frame>
    <description>The total annual acute exacerbation-related costs were obtained as the sum of direct and indirect costs for each patient over the follow-up period of 12 months.&#xD;
For estimation of costs the following variables were used: Acute exacerbation related resource use for direct cost estimation: primary and secondary care visits, emergency visits (primary care and hospital), hospitalizations, ICU with and without intubation (qualitative analysis), outpatient tests and other examinations, use of transport, use of formal caregiver, pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments (except treatments administered in hospitalization), orthopedic material, formal social services, economic aid and structural adaptations. Acute exacerbation related resource use for indirect cost estimation: patients' days off work and informal caregiver.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Non-interventional multicenter study in Spain, based on newly collected data of patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) aims to estimate the economic and social Impact of IPF according to the Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) value.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All patients who are diagnosed with IPF and attended to a routine visit during the inclusion period and met all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria and provided informed consent to participate were included in the study. IPF-Patients were reported by subgroup (predicted FVC% at baseline) for baseline characteristics and outcome measures, to make comparisons between groups. Data on caregiver burden was collected from routine clinical care using medical records and patient´s diary.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)-Related Costs</title>
        <description>The total annual IPF-related costs were obtained as the sum of direct health costs, direct non-health costs and indirect costs. IPF-related costs were quantified for each patient over the follow-up period of 12 months. The direct health and direct non-health costs were calculated as the sum of the costs of medical visits, emergency room visits, hospital admissions, outpatient tests, non-pharmacological treatments and pharmacological treatments and the sum of transport costs, paid caregivers costs, orthopedic material costs, financial aid, and structural changes cost. The indirect costs included number of IPF related days off work and time dedicated to patient care with IPF (informal caregiver). The opportunity cost method was used to calculate informal care costs. The indirect costs were estimated by applying salary costs based on the latest data published by the Spanish Instituto Nacional de Estadística from the salary structure survey, adjusted to age.</description>

        <description>The Quality of Life of patients with IPF according to Forced Vital Capacity (FVC)% predicted value, is assessed through SGRQ. The SGRQ is a 50-item questionaire developed to quantify the impact of the disease on the health and QoL perceived by patients with respiratory diseases. It consisted of 50 items divided into 3 scales: symptoms (frequency and severity of respiratory symptoms), activity (limitations due to dyspnoea) and impact (psychological and social functioning disorders caused by the disease). The final scores ranged from 0 (best health-related quality of life) to 100 (worse health-related quality of life). The number of participants analysed displays the number of participants with available data at the timepoint of interests.</description>

Barthel Index were used to score the ability of a participant to care for himself. It consists of 10 items, the values assigned to each item are based on time and amount of actual physical assistance required if a participant is unable to perform the activity. The final score ranges from 0 and 100. Participant scoring 100 is continent, feeds himself, dresses himself, gets up out of bed and chairs, bathes himself, walks at least a block, and can ascend and descend stairs.&#xD;

        <description>Economic Impact of IPF in adult patients through the estimation annual direct and indirect costs associated with the disease (€/year) from a social perspective by FVC decline according to predicted FVC%.&#xD;
FVC decline is calculated: FVC% (T12)- FVC%(T0)).&#xD;
In order to estimate the direct and indirect costs according to FVC decline the following variable were described:&#xD;
FVC predicted along the study. Men: FVC % predicted (%) = 100 FVC / (0.0678 T - 0.0147 E - 6.0548) Women: FVC % predicted (%) = 100 FVC / (0.0454 T - 0.0211 E - 2.8253)&#xD;
(FVC is FVC in liters, T is height in cm and E is age in years)&#xD;

        <title>Absolute Change in Saint George´s Respiratory Questionaire (SGRQ) Score From Baseline Visit (T0) to 12 Month Visit (T12) by Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) Decline - Overall FVC Patient Group</title>
        <description>Absolute Change in SGRQ score by FVC decline according to predicted FVC% from baseline visit (T0) to 12 month visit (T12).&#xD;
The SGRQ is a 50-item questionaire developed to quantify the impact of the disease on the health and QoL perceived by patients with respiratory diseases. It consisted of 50 items divided into 3 scales: symptoms, activity and impact. The final scores ranged from 0 (best health-related quality of life) to 100 (worse health-related quality of life).&#xD;
FVC decline: FVC% (T12)- FVC%(T0)&#xD;
In order to estimate the Quality of Life according to FVC decline the following variable were described:&#xD;
FVC % predicted along the study:. Men: FVC % predicted (%) = 100 FVC / (0.0678 T - 0.0147 E - 6.0548) Women: FVC % predicted (%) = 100 FVC / (0.0454 T - 0.0211 E - 2.8253)&#xD;
(FVC is FVC in liters, T is height in cm and E is age in years).&#xD;

          <title>Absolute Change in Saint George´s Respiratory Questionaire (SGRQ) Score From Baseline Visit (T0) to 12 Month Visit (T12) by Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) Decline - Subgroup: Predicted FVC&lt;50% at T0</title>
          <description>Absolute Change in SGRQ score by FVC decline according to predicted FVC% from baseline visit (T0) to 12 month visit (T12).&#xD;
The SGRQ is a 50-item questionaire developed to quantify the impact of the disease on the health and QoL perceived by patients with respiratory diseases. It consisted of 50 items divided into 3 scales: symptoms, activity and impact. The final scores ranged from 0 (best health-related quality of life) to 100 (worse health-related quality of life).&#xD;
FVC decline: FVC% (T12)- FVC%(T0)&#xD;
In order to estimate SGRQ according to FVC decline the following variable were described:&#xD;
Men: FVC % predicted (%) = 100 FVC / (0.0678 T - 0.0147 E - 6.0548) Women: FVC % predicted (%) = 100 FVC / (0.0454 T - 0.0211 E - 2.8253)&#xD;
(FVC is FVC in liters, T is height in cm and E is age in years).&#xD;
The calculated variable was stratified into the following subgroups between T0 and T12:&#xD;
≤-10%; from -10% to -5%; &gt;-5%&#xD;

      <desc>For all-cause mortality and serious adverse events the safety population (All screened patients with informed consent prior to participation) was used. Other Adverse events were reported only for patients with at least one dose of OFEV® (OFEV® Population), as defined in the study report. Please note that the number of deaths reported in all-cause mortality is higher than reported in the participant flow due to a number of participants dying after discontinuing the study.</desc>
