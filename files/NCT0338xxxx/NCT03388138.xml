    <time_frame>Baseline (Visit 1) and 1-week follow up (Visit 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Monocular contact lens-corrected distance visual acuity was assessed using a logMAR visual acuity scale. This was evaluated for each eye, under high luminance and high contrast conditions at 4 meters from ETDRS charts. Distance visual acuity was reported by lens type and visit.</description>

    <measure>The Number of Eyes With Clinically Significant Slit Lamp Findings</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1-Week Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Slit lamp findings were assessed using a biomicroscope for each subject eye at all scheduled and unscheduled visits. Clinical significant slit lamp findings are defined as Grade 3 or Grade 4. (Grade 0=None, Grade 1=Trace, Grade 2=Mild, Grade 3=Moderate and Grade 4= Severe). The data was dichotomized as 1=Grade 3 or Grade 4 and 0, otherwise. The number of eyes with clinically significant slit lamp findings for each lens type was reported.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Number of Eyes With Unacceptable Lens Fitting</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1-Week Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Lens fit was assessed for each subject and eye using a biomicroscope. Unacceptable lens fit was assessed at all scheduled and unscheduled visits. A subject was deemed to have an unacceptable lens fitting if they met any of the following criteria: (1) Limbal exposure at primary gaze with extreme eye movement, (2) edge lift, (3) excessive movement in primary up gaze, (4) insufficient movement in all three of the following conditions: primary gaze, up gaze and push up test. The number of eyes with unacceptable lens fitting was reported for each lens type.</description>

&#xD;
               5. The subject's contact lens correction must be in the range of -1.00 D to -6.00 D&#xD;
                  (inclusive) in each eye.&#xD;
&#xD;

               7. Have a spherocylindrical best corrected visual acuity of 20/30 or better in each&#xD;
                  eye (Snellen Visual Acuity).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Potential subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from&#xD;

                  neovascularization, corneal staining, tarsal abnormalities, conjunctival&#xD;
                  injection) on the FDA Biomicroscopy Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
               9. Any previous history or signs of a contact lens-related corneal inflammatory&#xD;
                  event (e.g., past peripheral ulcer or round peripheral scar), or any other ocular&#xD;
                  abnormality that would contraindicate contact lens wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
              10. Any known hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to ketotifen.&#xD;
&#xD;
              11. Participation in any eye drop, contact lens or lens care product clinical trial&#xD;
