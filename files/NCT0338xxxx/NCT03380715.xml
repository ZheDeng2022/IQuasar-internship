  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Co-phenylcaine is a widely available nasal spray commonly used by otorhinolaryngologists for&#xD;
      the purpose of decongestion and local anesthetic prior to a nasoendoscopic or&#xD;
      nasopharyngolaryngoscopy. It is often used in the outpatient setting and is also useful for&#xD;
      minor procedures. It is unique in its properties because it provides both local anesthetic&#xD;
      and decongestive effects on the nasal mucosa hence leading to better visualization of the&#xD;
      nasal cavity and better comfort for the patient during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacologically, Co-phenylcaine Forte comprises of a combination of Lignocaine 5% (50mg/ml)&#xD;
      and phenylephrine 0.5% (5mg/ml) and is commonly marketed in a 50ml bottle attached to a&#xD;
      disposable positive displacement atomizer which avoids contamination by preventing&#xD;
      contamination of the nozzle tip by secretions from other patients which are commonly seen in&#xD;
      older venturi devices.Its decongestive agent (phenylephrine) acts by influencing the&#xD;
      sympathetic vasculature tone via alpha adrenoceptors since its properties are sympathomimetic&#xD;
      and oppose vasodilation.As for the local anesthethic component (Lignocaine) , it is an amide&#xD;
      local anesthetic which blocks fast voltage gated sodium channels in the cell membrane thus&#xD;
      leading to a decrease in sensation when performing a nasoendoscopy. Despite of its&#xD;
      advantages, there are also disadvantages in the usage of such a device such as the need for&#xD;
      regular change of the nozzle head due to the risk of infection and the high cost of using&#xD;
      this device in the long run.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies has demonstrated promising results for the efficacy of nebulized medication&#xD;
      and its distribution of medication into the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses in both&#xD;
      healthy individuals and cadaver models.Its advantages over the classical nasal spray include&#xD;
      better distribution of medication throughout the nasal cavity and better hygiene due to the&#xD;
      ability to change and sterilize the nasal nozzle tip before re-usage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very little information is available about the delivery of topical decongestants via nasal&#xD;
      nebulization on the pre-endoscopic examination of the nasal cavity. This study aims to&#xD;
      compare the efficacy of topical decongestants delivered into the nasal cavity using nasal&#xD;
      nebulization against the delivery of topical decongestants using conventional nasal sprays.&#xD;

      Objectives General objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ To compare the efficacy of co-phenylcaine (Lignocaine + phenylephrine) in the decongestion&#xD;
      and anesthesia of the nasal cavity prior to endoscopic examination using nasal nebulization&#xD;
      as the delivery device in comparison to conventional nasal spray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To objectively assess the degree of nasal patency and nasal inspiratory flow by&#xD;
           performing anterior rhinomanometry at pre-procedure and post-procedure at 5, 10, 15, and&#xD;
           30 minutes' interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To objectively assess the blood pressure (BP) and pulse rate (PR) changes throughout the&#xD;
           post procedural intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To subjectively assess the pain scores using the Visual analogue scale (VAS) at&#xD;
           pre-procedure and post procedure at 5, 10, 15 and 30 minutes' intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To subjectively assess the after-taste commonly felt by the patient after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To subjectively assess the patient's NOSE (Nasal Obstruction symptom evaluation) score&#xD;
           prior to the commencement of the medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology This will be a multicenter, non blinded, prospective, randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      on the comparison of delivery of nasal decongestive agent (Co-phenylcaine) into the nasal&#xD;
      cavity using nasal sprays and nasal nebulization techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients matching the inclusion criteria, when visiting the Otorhinolaryngology clinic of&#xD;
      Hospital Tengku Ampuan Rahimah Klang and University Malaya Medical centre (UMMC) who require&#xD;
      nasoendoscopy, will be invited to take part in this prospective study over 6 months. An&#xD;
      informed consent will be taken detailing the procedure, study conducted and risks involved&#xD;
      while participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon agreeing to participate, the participant's baseline parameters will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline parameters will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline BP ,Age, Gender, Race&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Baseline BMI/Weight/Height&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pre procedure anterior Rhinomanometry reading for NIF (Nasal inspiratory flow), Flow&#xD;
           Sum, Flow INC&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Anterior rhinomanometer (ATMOS Rhino 31 model, ATMOS Medzintecknik GmbH &amp; Co.KG) is&#xD;
                used to document serial changes in nasal air flow throughout the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Procedure is done with the patient seated,secretions from the nose is cleared prior&#xD;
                to the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Nose adapter and hose for pressure measurement is placed in the opposite nostril.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Mask is pressed on to the face to measure the flow while ensuring good fitting.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. The patient is asked to breathe in and out while keeping the mouth closed. The&#xD;
                average of 3 readings are documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Procedure is repeated in the opposite nostril.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Baseline NOSE (Nasal obstruction symptom evaluation) score prior to procedure. [Figure 1]&#xD;
      3. VAS (Visual analogue scale) for pain. [Figure2].&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Painful sensation was induced in the right nasal cavity by probing the mucosa overlying&#xD;
           the inferior turbinate 1cm from the anterior end with the ring ended Jobson-Horne Probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pressure is maintained for about 1 second and the subject is asked to rate the pain&#xD;
           based on the visual analogue scale (VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 0 represents &quot;no pain &quot;and 10 represents the &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Cut off points for pain VAS recommended are: no pain (0-4mm),mild pain (5-44mm),moderate&#xD;
           pain (45-74mm), 75-100mm(severe pain).14&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient is given a randomized labelled card and is grouped according to the procedure.&#xD;
      Group A - Nasal spray, Group B - Nasal nebulizer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A - 4 sprays (400mcl) (20mg lidocaine + 2mg phenylephrine)) of co-phenylcaine are given&#xD;
      into the right nostril while keeping the left nostril as a control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B - 400mcl of co-phenylcaine (20mg of lidocaine + 2mg of phenylephrine) is added into&#xD;
      the nasal nebulizer device (Rinowash Nebula, Air liquid medical systems) and the solution is&#xD;
      diluted with 4.5cc of isotonic normal saline. This Mixture is then nebulized into the right&#xD;
      nasal cavity for approximately 3 minutes.The seated patient's head is kept flexed and&#xD;
      nebulizer device is kept sealed within the nasal cavity while the nebulization is done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post procedure, parameters are recorded 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes and 30 minutes post&#xD;
      procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Rhinomanometry readings of both nostrils (Right -tested , Left - Control)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pain VAS score 30 minutes' post procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. BP and PR repeated at 5,10,15 and 30 minutes' post procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Rigid Endoscopic examination and VAS based on degree of decongestion and ease of&#xD;
           endoscopic passage&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations The researchers will seek approval from the National Medical Research&#xD;
      and Ethics committee (MREC) of the Ministry of health(MOH), Malaysia via the National Medical&#xD;
      Research Registry (NMRR). All responses are confidential; all respondents are allowed to&#xD;
      refuse participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since both medical devices delivers the same drug,the side effects which the participant may&#xD;
      experience include tremors, palpitations, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, numbness and most&#xD;
      commonly a transient bitter taste in the mouth for a few minutes. Rarely, the participant may&#xD;
      develop a hypersensitive reaction towards the offending medication.The risks will be managed&#xD;
      accordingly and symptomatically and the medication will be stopped immediately if the&#xD;
      participant develops symptoms during the delivery of the medication. The participant maybe&#xD;
      admitted to the ward for further monitoring if symptoms become severe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of the study product on an unborn child is not known. The participants is advised&#xD;
      to inform the study doctor immediately if she thinks that she is pregnant during the study.&#xD;
      If she is pregnant, the study therapy will be discontinued immediately and she will be&#xD;
      removed from the study. The participant is advised to ask the doctor if he/she needs more&#xD;
      information on the risks and side effects. The trial staff will inform him/her in a timely&#xD;
      manner about any new findings or changes about the study product which may affect his/her&#xD;
      health or willingness to continue in this study. Where necessary, the participant may be&#xD;
      asked to re-consent to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the participant's information obtained in this study will be kept and handled in a&#xD;
      confidential manner, in accordance with applicable laws and/or regulations. When publishing&#xD;
      or presenting the study results, the participant's identity will not be revealed without&#xD;
      his/her expressed consent. Individuals involved in this study, qualified monitors and&#xD;
      auditors, the sponsor or its affiliates and governmental or regulatory authorities may&#xD;
      inspect and copy his/her medical records, where appropriate and necessary. Data is kept in&#xD;
      both hard and digital copies. Hard copies are kept in lockable cabinets with controlled&#xD;
      access when not under direct supervision of a member of the research team. The study data is&#xD;
      kept for at least 5 years and henceforth may be destroyed after the duration has expired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study doctor or the sponsor may due to concerns for the participant's safety, stop the&#xD;
      study at any time. If the study is stopped early for any reason the participant will be&#xD;
      informed and arrangements made for the participants future care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for data analysis and interpretation The raw data will be processed and entered for data&#xD;
      analysis starting as soon as the patient is recruited till the end of the study.Data will be&#xD;
      sorted out and processed on a weekly basis. Data entry, utilizing codes was done using SPSS&#xD;
      software version 23. Computer assisted analysis will be carried out at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the proposed study, sample size was determined by using power study. This power study was&#xD;
      performed using web based sample size calculator&#xD;
      (http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~rollin/stats/ssize/n2a.html) which is a very useful tool in medical&#xD;
      and biological research to determine the sample size. Considering 90% power and 5% marginal&#xD;
      error (type one error for Î± value=0.05), this study gives a minimum sample size of 55 per&#xD;
      group (based on the mean and SD obtained from a recent study [13]). Finally, the&#xD;
      investigators take 60 sample sizes per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization was done by using a web based randomizer&#xD;
      http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/randomize1@ 18th March 2016@1500H where the total number&#xD;
      is separated in 2 groups and each group containing 60 samples. The numbers are randomized and&#xD;
      printed according to the web based randomizer at the aforementioned date and time. Generated&#xD;
      numbers are then saved for further reference. The numbers are then placed in envelopes and&#xD;
      given to the patient. The numbers which are received by the patient will determine the group&#xD;
      by which the patient is selected into.&#xD;
