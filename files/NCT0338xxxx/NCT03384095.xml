  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized Phase II trial to&#xD;
      determine whether oral hyaluronic acid will prevent aromatase inhibitor (AI)-associated&#xD;
      arthralgias. Subjects must have ER/PR-positive breast cancer tumor with history of aromatase&#xD;
      inhibitor-associated musculoskeletal symptoms (AIMSS) which resolved after cessation of their&#xD;
      AI (anastrazole or letrozole) within 90 days of enrollment. Subjects will be stratified by&#xD;
      initial AI, thus within each initial AI, subjects will be randomized to receive either the&#xD;
      experimental treatment (hyaluronic acid) or placebo. Subjects will begin the assigned&#xD;
      treatment for 2 weeks prior to transitioning to the second AI. Evaluations will be taken at&#xD;
      baseline, 6 weeks (1 month on study drug and AI), 14 weeks (3 months on study drug and AI),&#xD;
      and at 26 weeks (6 months on study drug and AI). Treatment with hyaluronic acid and placebo&#xD;
      will last for 26 weeks total.&#xD;

      Primary Objective To determine whether oral HA will prevent AI-induced arthralgias and&#xD;
      preserve physical function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To explore whether oral HA will have an acceptable safety and tolerability profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether oral HA will prevent other AI associated symptoms as assessed by&#xD;
           patient reported outcomes (PRO's).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess how many of the subjects are 90% compliant with taking the HA as directed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objective To determine if mi486, (a microRNA enriched in skeletal muscle) and&#xD;
      other biomarkers associated with AIMSS (TNF, IL-6, IL-17) vary with the administration of HA.&#xD;

    <time_frame>14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>As measured by the Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form (BPI-SF) questions #3-#6, #9A-G. This 14-item questionnaire was developed for use in patients with cancer that uses a scale from 0 to 10 to assess worst pain, pain severity, and pain interference over the past week. The first 8 items have to do with the severity of the pain, and the remaining 7 items ask about how the pain has affected function.</description>
