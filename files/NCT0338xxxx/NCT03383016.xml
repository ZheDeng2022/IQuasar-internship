  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The risk of prostate cancer is associated with lifestyle habits, such as diet and physical&#xD;
      activity. Indeed, results of numerous studies suggest links between obesity, diabetes,&#xD;
      inflammation and androgen and estrogen metabolism in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of BIOCaPPE study (Biomarkers and Prostate Cancer/ Prevention and Environment) is to&#xD;
      identify biomarkers of prostate cancer risk that are potentially modifiable by environmental&#xD;
      exposures (e.g. diet and physical activity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A selection of few of the most promising biological markers will be evaluated in a cohort of&#xD;
      more than 2000 men at high-risk of prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such biomarkers would provide a practical approach to identify men at high risk of prostate&#xD;
      cancer who could benefit from interventions aiming at reducing their risk. The biomarkers&#xD;
      would also be useful to monitor the efficacy of the interventions on patient's lifestyle.&#xD;

      The main objective of the proposed research project is to assess the association between five&#xD;
      candidate biological markers potentially modifiable by environmental exposures (diet and&#xD;
      physical activity) and the two-year risk of prostate cancer in a newly recruited cohort of&#xD;
      men at high-risk of prostate cancer showing no evidence of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four hospitals in the province of Quebec (Canada) participate to the recruitment of 2,055 men&#xD;
      at high-risk for prostate cancer, i.e. men who had a first negative prostate biopsy or whose&#xD;
      Prostatic Specific Antigen (PSA) level is between 2.5 and 10 ng/mL without previous prostate&#xD;
      biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The candidate biomarkers that will be tested are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The ratio of ω-3/ ω-6 fatty acid content of red blood cell membranes,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Oxidized low density lipoprotein cholesterol&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Adiponectin&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Insulin growth factor-1&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The ratio of dihydrotestosterone glucuronide derivatives over estradiol&#xD;
&#xD;
      A biobank, composed of biological material (whole blood, plasma, serum, lymphocyte layer and&#xD;
      excess tissue collected from prostate biopsy or prostate surgery) and clinical data is being&#xD;
      created. Questionnaires are used to compile information on socio-demographic aspects, family&#xD;
      and personal medical history, quality of life, lifestyle like food and sexual habits.&#xD;
