  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This examines in-vivo microwave sensing to measure a radio- frequency signal propagating&#xD;
      through the wrist and, based on this information, establish a correlation of measured&#xD;
      parameters with the integral bone density. This radio- frequency device is designed to obtain&#xD;
      an integral estimate of bone density (osteoporotic vs normal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurements can be done in three ways. The first method (Method 1) utilizes Received&#xD;
      Signal Strength (RSS) of an RFID tag array at 915 megahertz located on the top of the wrist.&#xD;
      The transmitting antenna located on the bottom of the wrist is connected to an RFID reader.&#xD;
      In that way, the signal travels twice across the wrist: from the reader to the tag and vice&#xD;
      versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second method (Method 2) is to use only one transmitting antenna, connect the&#xD;
      transmitting antenna to a portable Network Analyzer and measure the reflection coefficient,&#xD;
      S11, of the antenna itself. This method does not imply that the entire signal will travel&#xD;
      back and forth through the wrist, although its significant portion will. This method is,&#xD;
      however, broadband and allows us to measure antenna resonances, which are very sensitive to&#xD;
      the wrist composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third method (Method 3) is to use both transmitting and receiving antennas, connect the&#xD;
      antennas to a portable KeySight Network Analyzer and measure the transmission coefficient,&#xD;
      S21, of the antenna pair. This method implies that the entire signal will travel through the&#xD;
      wrist once. This method is also broadband and allows us to measure decay of the radio-signal&#xD;
      in the wrist over a band of frequencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two last methods could be combined together.&#xD;
