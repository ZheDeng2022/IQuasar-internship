  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of PROGRO is to determine which combinations of milk and plant proteins are&#xD;
      optimal to promote growth factors in children&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to assess how different protein blends affect growth factors in&#xD;
      children. There is evidence to support that milk protein increases growth in children in both&#xD;
      high and low-income countries. Therefore milk protein is often used in food aid for&#xD;
      undernourished children in low-income countries. The study investigates if plant protein can&#xD;
      partially replace milk protein without affecting growth promotion negatively. Plant protein&#xD;
      could potentially reduce food aid costs and at the same time be a more sustainable protein&#xD;
      source.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PROGRO study is a 3-arm randomized, controlled trial. The effect of consuming 35 g pure&#xD;
      milk protein/day is compared to intake of 35 g milk and rapeseed protein/day (ratio 30:70 and&#xD;
      54:46, respectively) in 7-8 year old healthy Danish children. The intervention period is 4&#xD;
      weeks and measurements and blood sampling are performed at baseline, week 1 and week 4. A&#xD;
      3-day weighed dietary intake is recorded before each visit. The primary outcome is&#xD;
      Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1).&#xD;
