  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have had a previous allograft failure represent a major problem for transplant&#xD;
      centers as they are highly-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) sensitized and unlikely to receive&#xD;
      another transplant without significant desensitization. This single center, phase I/II, open&#xD;
      label single-arm exploratory study focuses on enrolling twenty patients (ages 15-75) who will&#xD;
      begin desensitization therapy to achieve HLA incompatible (HLAi) renal transplantation.&#xD;
      Patients who qualify will receive up to 6 doses of clazakizumab 25 mg monthly&#xD;
      pre-transplantation. If patients receive an HLAi transplant during the study, the&#xD;
      participants will continue to receive another 6 monthly doses of clazakizumab 25 mg, followed&#xD;
      by a 6 month protocol biopsy. Patients will continue another 6 doses over 6 months if&#xD;
      improvements are seen after the 6th dose of clazakizumab. Patients who develop evidence of&#xD;
      persistent allograft dysfunction may have non-protocol biopsies for cause. Patients who&#xD;
      receive 12 doses of clazakizumab post-transplant will receive a 12M protocol biopsy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, Phase I/II, open label single-arm exploratory study. The trial will&#xD;
      primarily examine the safety and tolerability of clazakizumab given after consented and&#xD;
      eligible patients begin desensitization therapy to achieve HLAi renal transplantation at&#xD;
      Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. 20 subjects (ages 15 to 75) who are highly-HLA sensitized (HS)&#xD;
      as determined by the cPRA â‰¥50% and are eligible for desensitization will be evaluated. All&#xD;
      patients will be accrued from the renal transplant program at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.&#xD;
      Once desensitization begins, anti-HLA antibodies will be assessed which are associated with&#xD;
      ABMR and/or graft loss. HLA antibodies will be detected using solid phase assay systems&#xD;
      currently utilized at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center HLA Laboratory. These anti-HLA&#xD;
      antibodies may result naturally or from previous pregnancy, transfusions, or prior&#xD;
      transplants. Patients treated with clazakizumab x 6 doses for desensitization will have blood&#xD;
      sampling for HLA antibodies, and other monitoring blood samples as well as immunologic&#xD;
      studies as outlined. If patients receive an HLAi transplant during the study, participants&#xD;
      will receive the standard post-transplant immunosuppressive protocol, and clazakizumab 25 mg&#xD;
      SC Q4W X 6 doses with immune monitoring as indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immune monitoring in blood samples for Treg, Tfh, Th17 and B-cell subsets as well as IL-6 and&#xD;
      CRP monitoring will be carried out at the Cedars-Sinai Transplant Immunology Laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients identified as study participants will be HS and listed for HLAi renal&#xD;
      transplantation at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Cedars-Sinai is a major U.S. desensitization&#xD;
      center and performs ~80 HLAi renal transplants per-year. ~ 100 new HS patients are referred&#xD;
      to Cedars-Sinai each year as potential candidates for desensitization. Eligible patients&#xD;
      entering the study will initially receive PLEX (5-7 sessions) + IVIG and receive clazakizumab&#xD;
      25 mg SC one week post-IVIG. If no safety/tolerability/efficacy issues are observed after the&#xD;
      initial dose, patients will receive 5 additional injections Q4W. If patients receive an HLAi&#xD;
      transplant, clazakizumab will be continued for 6M post- transplant at 25mg SC Q4W for 6 doses&#xD;
      (starting at Day 5 post-transplant). A protocol biopsy will be performed at 6M&#xD;
      post-transplant to assess the allograft for evidence of ABMR, including C4d staining and TG&#xD;
      using Banff 2015 criteria. Patients will continue another 6 doses over 6 months if&#xD;
      improvements are seen after the 6th dose of clazakizumab. Patients who develop evidence of&#xD;
      persistent allograft dysfunction may have non-protocol biopsies for cause. Patients who&#xD;
      receive 12 doses of clazakizumab post-transplant will receive a 12M protocol biopsy. In the&#xD;
      event a patient does not show improvement after receiving 6 doses of clazakizumab, no further&#xD;
      treatment will be given and the patient will return at Day 365 for a final study visit. All&#xD;
      subjects will be evaluated on an intent-to-treat basis. The subject accrual rate will be&#xD;
      limited to no more than 1-2 subjects per month in the initial three months to assure safety&#xD;
      to all subjects. Repeat laboratories will be performed at the completion of clazakizumab&#xD;
      therapy to determine effect on levels and correlation with any potential events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be followed to determine if the use of clazakizumab for desensitization in&#xD;
      this high risk transplant population is safe and without infectious risks. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators will determine the effects of clazakizumab treatment on HLA antibodies in&#xD;
      efforts to improve access to HLAi transplants for these individuals. The investigators have&#xD;
      previously reported acceptance criteria for HLAi kidney transplants. Renal biopsy assessments&#xD;
      will be performed at 6M (per protocol) and 12M (for those who received 12 doses of therapy).&#xD;
      The investigators will assess the transplanted patients to determine the number who sustain a&#xD;
      viable and functioning kidney allograft as well. All subjects will be evaluated on an&#xD;
      intent-to-treat basis. The subject accrual rate will be limited to no more than 1-2 subjects&#xD;
      per month in the initial three months to assure safety to all subjects.&#xD;

    <description>All twenty patients will receive clazakizumab monthly. Patients will receive up to 6 doses pre-transplantation. If patients are transplanted during the study, they will then receive 6 doses of clazakizumab (monthly) and a 6 month protocol biopsy will be performed. Based on the biopsy results and clinical labs PI will determine if patients should continue monthly doses for up to another 6 doses and day 330 post-transplantation. Patients who received 12 post-transplant doses of clazakizumab will then undergo a 12 month protocol biopsy.</description>
