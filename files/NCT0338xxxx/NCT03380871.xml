      The purpose of this study is to find out if treatment with NEO-PV-01 in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab and chemotherapy (pembrolizumab/chemotherapy) is safe and useful for patients&#xD;
      with lung cancer. The study also will assess if the NEO-PV-01 vaccine, when given together&#xD;
      with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy, can improve your response compared with pembrolizumab&#xD;
      and chemotherapy treatment alone. All eligible patients will receive NEO-PV-01 + Adjuvant,&#xD;
      pembrolizumab and chemotherapy while on this trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will enroll patients with advanced or metastatic nonsquamous non-small&#xD;
      cell lung carcinoma not having received treatment for metastatic disease. The five agents&#xD;
      being used in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A new, investigational, personalized cancer vaccine called &quot;NEO-PV-01&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Poly-ICLC (Hiltonol), an investigational adjuvant that is used to help stimulate the&#xD;
           immune system&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A cancer drug called pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A chemotherapy called pemetrexed (ALIMPTA®)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A chemotherapy called carboplatin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both NEO-PV-01 and pembrolizumab are considered immunotherapies and work using the immune&#xD;
      system to fight cancer. NEO-PV-01 is a custom made vaccine for you that is based on the&#xD;
      specific targets on your cancer. Poly-ICLC is an adjuvant that helps stimulate the immune&#xD;
      system and make the vaccine, NEO-PV-01, more effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab helps T-cells, a certain type of immune cell, that recognize these targets to&#xD;
      reach and attack your cancer. Pembrolizumab, which is approved in the USA and some other&#xD;
      countries, is available by prescription to treat several different cancers, including the&#xD;
      type of cancer that you have. Recently, the FDA also approved the combination of&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab with chemotherapy for the treatment of your type of lung cancer. This&#xD;
      combination works better than each of the drugs on their own.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find out if treatment with NEO-PV-01 in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab and chemotherapy is safe and useful for patients with lung cancer. The study&#xD;
      also will assess if the NEO-PV-01 vaccine, when given together with pembrolizumab and&#xD;
      chemotherapy, can improve your immune response compared with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy&#xD;
      treatment alone. The side effects of NEO-PV-01, pembrolizumab, and chemotherapy will be&#xD;
      monitored and additional research tests will be done to assess your immune response to your&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
