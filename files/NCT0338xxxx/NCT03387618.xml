      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of investigational Positron Emission&#xD;
      Tomography (PET) imaging using the new generation digital detector PET technology for new&#xD;
      procedures beyond the current standard of care.&#xD;

      The objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To enable innovative PET imaging in association with a clinical trial to add potential&#xD;
           future biomarker readouts for disease characterization and therapy management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To generate preliminary and comparative imaging data for potential confirmatory clinical&#xD;
           trials using innovative imaging timepoints, acquisition, dose, and timing approaches,&#xD;
           and/or postprocessing procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To explore digital PET imaging for new indications where PET is not currently considered&#xD;
           a standard of care diagnostic procedure in order to be able to design future clinical&#xD;
           trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET imaging is increasingly being used as a diagnostic modality in cancer detection and&#xD;
      staging, neuro-molecular assessment, cardiovascular-molecular imaging,&#xD;
      physiological/musculoskeletal imaging, and response assessment. Additionally, PET imaging is&#xD;
      utilized in the detection and assessment of inflammatory processes. Constant advances in&#xD;
      detector technology, image acquisition, and post-processing approaches could lead to the&#xD;
      increased utility of PET in many currently unmet clinical scenarios.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have already performed an intra-individual comparison trial demonstrating&#xD;
      advanced capabilities of digital PET technology in regard to lesion detection, lesion&#xD;
      characterization, quantification, duration of scan time, and reduction of radiation dose. The&#xD;
      digital PET is now fully FDA approved, and in this trial the investigators need to generate&#xD;
      preliminary data in order to design prospective clinical trials that allow the validation of&#xD;
      a hypothesis. The investigators have demonstrated the safety of the system [now FDA approved]&#xD;
      and the overall efficacy in relation to current clinical care practice standards; however,&#xD;
      the technology enables the change of those standards for which the investigators need to&#xD;
      demonstrate the clinical feasibility that they have either shown in pre-clinical PET imaging&#xD;
      or via simulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research focuses on evaluating the new capabilities of PET imaging which may be improved&#xD;
      or enabled by a new generation of fully digital PET systems. In order to change clinical&#xD;
      practice, the investigators need to first generate data on the potential capabilities of this&#xD;
      major technology improvement. The investigators will be performing and evaluating&#xD;
      investigational PET/CT imaging beyond the current standard of care practice. Prior studies by&#xD;
      the study team have already performed comparisons between the new and current PET imaging;&#xD;
      however, the digital PET studies were constrained by being performed as a comparison to&#xD;
      standard of care. In this clinical trial, the investigators can conduct research studies at&#xD;
      innovative time points or using innovative procedures currently not covered by insurance,&#xD;
      such as repeat imaging prior to treatment or midway through treatment for replanning purposes&#xD;
      or to find better quantitative readouts to improve diagnosis and disease management. The&#xD;
      investigators intend to conduct PET imaging also for indications not typically covered by&#xD;
      insurance, such as cardiac, neuro-related, or orthopedic/sports medicine indications. The&#xD;
      investigators may also perform imaging with FDA approved radiotracers beyond their normal use&#xD;
      (off-label) to explore the synergistic capabilities of the new generation of PET imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective study will utilize investigational PET acquisitions on the newly available&#xD;
      digital photon counting detector platform to develop and optimize PET acquisition and&#xD;
      postprocessing techniques as well as to generate preliminary and comparative data for&#xD;
      potential confirmatory clinical trials. The investigators will assess these innovations in&#xD;
      regard but not limited to visual inspection of lesions, normal tissue, sentinel nodes and&#xD;
      imaging artifacts, semi-quantitative and blinded reader analysis. The PET methodologies that&#xD;
      are planned to be used as part of this study will allow the investigators to obtain&#xD;
      morphological, functional and molecular information in ways beyond any current standard of&#xD;
      care imaging procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are anticipated to be recruited from 3 general populations. 1 - Patients enrolled in&#xD;
      a clinical trial where innovative PET imaging may be beneficial to the trial, although not&#xD;
      necessarily the individual patient. This would include patients enrolled in a clinical trial&#xD;
      exploring a new treatment approach for whom imaging at other timepoints in treatment would&#xD;
      not be covered by insurance and therefore not considered standard of care (SOC). 2 - Any&#xD;
      patient with a concern for a medical condition / question not yet fully resolved by SOC&#xD;
      practice for whom a treating physician believes that a research PET may have a potential to&#xD;
      address the medical question and help for future patients with similar questions. For&#xD;
      example, this could include a patient presenting with heel pain for whom standard x-ray shows&#xD;
      no confirmation of injury, but the physician feels an innovative PET bone scan could help&#xD;
      identify the cause of the pain. 3 - Any patient having a SOC PET scan who would be interested&#xD;
      in receiving an investigational scan, either as part of or in addition to the SOC scan. This&#xD;
      would include patients already scheduled for a SOC scan who would be willing to have an&#xD;
      investigational PET acquisition immediately following the standard acquisition for example&#xD;
      acquired with a shorter scan time. This would also include patients who have already had a&#xD;
      SOC PET examination, but would be willing to have a second, investigational PET exam, with a&#xD;
      significantly reduced radiotracer dose for example.Thus the radiation dose and exposure&#xD;
      associated with the investigational imaging would be in addition to any standard of care&#xD;
      imaging, although the two will be combined whenever appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to provide study personnel with authorization to access their medical&#xD;
      records for follow-up on future related procedures as well as the current outcome of their&#xD;
      standard of care imaging. Additionally, participants will be asked if their imaging data from&#xD;
      this study can be used in a de-identified manner in the future for comparison with other&#xD;
      imaging data or as preliminary data for the protocol development of clinical trials.&#xD;
