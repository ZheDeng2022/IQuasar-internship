    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical and virologic benefit of pimodivir in&#xD;
      combination with Standard-of-Care (SOC) treatment compared to placebo in combination with SOC&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This double-blind (neither researchers nor participants know what treatment participant is&#xD;
      receiving) study will evaluate efficacy/safety of pimodivir in combination with SOC treatment&#xD;
      versus placebo in combination with SOC treatment in adolescent (13 to 17 years), adult (18 to&#xD;
      65 years), and elderly (greater than [&gt;] 65 but less than or equal to [&lt;=] 85 years)&#xD;
      non-hospitalized participants with influenza A infection who are at risk of developing&#xD;
      complications. The study will be conducted in 3 phases: screening phase, double-blind&#xD;
      treatment period (5 days), a post treatment follow-up period (23 days). Study evaluations&#xD;
      include efficacy, clinical and virological outcomes, pharmacokinetics (PK),&#xD;
      PK/pharmacodynamics, biomarkers, safety and tolerability. The duration of participation in&#xD;
      the study for each participant is 28 days.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The Flu-iiQ is a PRO that measures influenza symptom intensity (none, mild, moderate, or severe) on a 4 point Likert response rating scale ranging from 0 to 3, where &quot;0&quot; represents the absence of symptom and &quot;3&quot; represents the severe symptom. The resolution of influenza-related symptoms is defined as the beginning of the 24-hour period that 7 influenza symptoms (cough, sore throat, headache, nasal congestion, feeling feverish, body aches and pains, fatigue) are at most mild or at least back to previous level of symptom severity in case the participant reported the symptom as pre-existing.</description>

        <title>Time to Resolution of 7 Primary Influenza-related Symptoms as Assessed by the Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) Measure Flu-Intensity and Impact Questionnaire (Flu-iiQ)</title>
        <description>The Flu-iiQ is a PRO that measures influenza symptom intensity (none, mild, moderate, or severe) on a 4 point Likert response rating scale ranging from 0 to 3, where &quot;0&quot; represents the absence of symptom and &quot;3&quot; represents the severe symptom. The resolution of influenza-related symptoms is defined as the beginning of the 24-hour period that 7 influenza symptoms (cough, sore throat, headache, nasal congestion, feeling feverish, body aches and pains, fatigue) are at most mild or at least back to previous level of symptom severity in case the participant reported the symptom as pre-existing.</description>
        <time_frame>Up to Day 28</time_frame>
        <population>The Intent-To-Treat infected (ITT-i) Set included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug and who had confirmed infection with influenza A and analyzed by planned treatment.</population>

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>If an investigator wishes to publish information from the study, a copy of the manuscript must be provided to the sponsor for review at least 60 days before submission for publication or presentation. If requested by the sponsor in writing, the investigator will withhold such publication for up to an additional 60 days.</restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>As the study was terminated early after a pre-planned interim analysis which showed futility, the Sponsor decided not to perform the complete analysis planned per protocol. Hence, data was collected and analyzed for safety and selected efficacy parameters.</limitations_and_caveats>
