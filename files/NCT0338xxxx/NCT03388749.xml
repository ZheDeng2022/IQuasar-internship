  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, dose escalation study that will determine the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of liposomal annamycin as a single&#xD;
      agent for the treatment of subjects with AML that is refractory to or relapsed after&#xD;
      induction therapy&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enrollment will occur in cohorts of 3 subjects in a conventional 3+3 escalating dose design,&#xD;
      starting at a dose level of 120 mg/m2/day administered for 3 days. Dose escalation will take&#xD;
      place on the basis of safety assessments in sequential cohorts of 3 subjects each. The&#xD;
      initial cohort will receive 120 mg/m2/day for 3 days. For Cohorts 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, dose&#xD;
      escalation will occur in 30-mg/m2/day increments until subjects are enrolled at a&#xD;
      240-mg/m2/day dose. For Cohorts 6, 7, and 8, dose escalation will occur in 60-mg/m2/day&#xD;
      increments until subjects are enrolled at a maximum dose of 420 mg/m2/day. Thus subsequent&#xD;
      cohorts will receive 150, 180, 210, 240, 300, 360, and up to a maximum of 420 mg/m2/day for 3&#xD;
      days in the absence of safety concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each cohort during the dose escalation phase, if 1 of the 3 subjects experiences a DLT,&#xD;
      the cohort of subjects at that dose level will be expanded to 6 subjects. If at least 2 of&#xD;
      the 6 subjects experience a DLT, this will be considered a toxic dose and the next 3 subjects&#xD;
      will be treated at a lower dose. The dose will be de-escalated in 30-mg/m2/day increments. As&#xD;
      such, if at least 2 out of 6 subjects receiving 300, 360, or 420 mg/m2/day experience a DLT,&#xD;
      the next 3 subjects will receive 270, 330, or 390 mg/m2/day, respectively. The MTD is defined&#xD;
      as the highest dose of L-Annamycin at which fewer than 2 (of a cohort of up to 6) subjects&#xD;
      experience a DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the MTD/RP2D is identified, up to 21 additional subjects will be enrolled at the&#xD;
      MTD/RP2D to better define toxicity and evaluate efficacy at this dose.&#xD;

          2. Subjects have AML that is refractory to or relapsed after induction therapy (i.e.,&#xD;
             subjects relapsed after experiencing a CR with their prior therapy). To be defined as&#xD;
             relapse, there must be &gt;5% blasts in the bone marrow.&#xD;
