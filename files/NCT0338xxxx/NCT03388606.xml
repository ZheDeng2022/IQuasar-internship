      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Almost 20% of Americans have depression. It is a leading cause of disability because it is&#xD;
      chronic and it starts early. The highest incidence is among adolescents and young adults. But&#xD;
      researchers don t know much about why some people become depressed whilst others don t. One&#xD;
      possibility is that the way people process rewarding stimuli could be related to their risk&#xD;
      for depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To characterize and treat depression in youth by focusing on reward processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 11 17 with major depressive disorder or subthreshold depression&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers ages 11 17&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with interviews and questionnaires. They will have memory,&#xD;
      thinking, and concentration tests. They may have a urine pregnancy test or have photos or&#xD;
      videos taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the initial visit, participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perform tasks and be interviewed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. For this, participants will lie in a&#xD;
      metal cylinder in a magnetic field. They will do study tasks while looking at a screen in the&#xD;
      scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Look at pictures of stimuli that signal win (rewards) or loss and get money for making&#xD;
      certain choices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have brain and eye activity monitored&#xD;
&#xD;
      Do tasks in a virtual reality environment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wear an activity monitor&#xD;
&#xD;
      Choose to have blood taken for research studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perform tasks while in magneto-encephalography a machine that uses sensitive magnetic sensors&#xD;
      to measure the brain s electric activity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get phone prompts at home to ask about their mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have several follow-up visits the first year, then 1-2 each year until they&#xD;
      are 25. They will repeat some tasks above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants with depression can elect to receive outpatient treatment at NIH and can&#xD;
      receive inpatient treatment at NIH, if they wish. None of the treatments are experimental,&#xD;
      that is, all treatments are standard and have an evidence base. Patients will have more&#xD;
      visits before and after they have treatment. They will do some of the tests above plus drug&#xD;
      testing. Participants who are in treatment and their parents will talk with a Senior&#xD;
      Attending physician, a nurse, social worker, or psychologist. Those in outpatient treatment&#xD;
      will have practice work between visits. Those who are inpatients will have practice work&#xD;
      during their inpatient treatment and adjustments to medication can be made.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression has a prevalence of 19% in the US population and close to 350 million people&#xD;
      suffer from the disorder worldwide. The chronic course of depression and its early onset a&#xD;
      maximal incidence in adolescence and young adulthood contribute to it being a leading cause&#xD;
      of disability worldwide. Yet, compared to many other medical conditions, we know little about&#xD;
      the mechanisms underlying depression. In recent years, reward processing has been proposed to&#xD;
      underlie several key behavioral and neural aberrations observed in depression. This has led&#xD;
      to the promise that targeting reward processing may lead to much needed breakthroughs in the&#xD;
      field. In this protocol we seek to characterize and treat depression in youth by integrating&#xD;
      methodological and conceptual approaches that specifically focus on reward processing.&#xD;
      Patients and their families can elect to participate in standard outpatient or inpatient&#xD;
      clinical care in this protocol. Our objective is to answer four key questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is the concordance of measures of reward processing in depression over time?&#xD;
           Measurement is fundamental to answering substantive questions in science. Our review of&#xD;
           the literature identified gaps in the reliability of reward measurement, the concordance&#xD;
           between measures, and a dearth of studies that employ repeated-measure designs. We&#xD;
           propose to tackle this using a multi-method approach in a longitudinal design.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Are reward processing aberrations in depression similar to those in other common&#xD;
           problems of childhood, such as anxiety and irritability? Specificity-in this case&#xD;
           establishing which reward aberrations are unique to a certain phenotype as opposed to a&#xD;
           generic finding related to psychopathology-is important for both nosology (disease&#xD;
           classification) and for designing rational treatments for psychiatric problems. Below,&#xD;
           we describe how we propose to answer this question by characterizing reward processing&#xD;
           in those with depression and comparing it to processing in those with other common&#xD;
           psychiatric problems in youth, such as anxiety and irritability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. How does reward processing interact with systems subserving sense of agency? As&#xD;
           described above, decision-making is an intricate part of reward processing. It is&#xD;
           assumed that higher-order cognitive processes, such as the sense of ownership of one s&#xD;
           actions-referred to as sense of agency-influence reward processing. Establishing the&#xD;
           role of such higher-order processes in depression could lead to developing treatments&#xD;
           that boost cognition and restore reward processing in depression. Below, we propose to&#xD;
           answer this question by testing whether inter-individual differences in sense of agency&#xD;
           explain variation in depression via reward processing (a mediation model).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. How is reward processing affected by changes in metabolic, inflammatory, and&#xD;
           neuroendocrinological markers?&#xD;
&#xD;
           There is mounting evidence for differences in metabolic, inflammatory, and&#xD;
           neuroendocrine markers when comparing those with and without MDD; however, the&#xD;
           relationship of such differences to reward processing-the focus of this protocol-remain&#xD;
           poorly examined. We wish to explore the direction of effect between inflammatory&#xD;
           responses and metabolic changes with depression and reward processes. We wish to do this&#xD;
           informed by knowledge of an individual s genetic background. The aim is to establish&#xD;
           trajectories of stability/change in metabolic and inflammatory markers and relate them&#xD;
           to mood changes and reward changes over time. We also wish to align our protocol with Dr&#xD;
           Zarate s Protocol 17-M-0060, Neuropharmacologic Imaging and Biomarker Assessments of&#xD;
           Response to Acute and Repeated-Dosed Ketamine Infusions in Major Depressive Disorder&#xD;
           that focuses on depression in adults. Collecting these data on adolescents will allow us&#xD;
           to identify differences and overlaps between adolescents (from this protocol) and the&#xD;
           adults in Dr. Zarate s protocol 17-M-0060.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. How is reward processing affected by environmentally-generated stress?&#xD;
&#xD;
           Studies from our own group demonstrate that stress in early life has an impact on how&#xD;
           rewards and punishers are processed in the brain several years later. Similarly, there&#xD;
           is good evidence for the acute effects of stress on reward processing, as indicated in&#xD;
           our recent metanalysis. And, of course, there is ample evidence for the role on how&#xD;
           stressful events worsen symptoms of depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic presents an unprecedented challenge for the world&#xD;
           s physical health, but is also expected to have a profound impact on people s&#xD;
           psychological wellbeing. The COVID-19 pandemic is a huge medical challenge to be sure,&#xD;
           and, by virtue of being a naturally occurring stress, presents an opportunity for us,&#xD;
           using longitudinal methods, to learn more about how humans respond to such environmental&#xD;
           influences. Moreover, it offers an opportunity for us to understand more about human&#xD;
           behaviour and potentially use such knowledge to inform future interventions. The aim,&#xD;
           using remote on-line methods, is to learn about how such environmental stress is&#xD;
           experienced by healthy volunteer teens and those with depression, the relationship&#xD;
           between stress and self-rated measures of depression, and the association of measures of&#xD;
           stress and depression on reward processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
           We will study four populations: (1) Healthy volunteer children and adults (HVs; n=600);&#xD;
           (2) Participants with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD; n=500); (3) Participants with&#xD;
           subthreshold depression (s-MDD; n=200); (4) parents (biological or legal guardians) of&#xD;
           children with MDD, s-MDD, or HVs who are enrolled in this protocol (N=800 total as&#xD;
           400/200/200 respectively). Study participants will be aged 11-17 years; at the time of&#xD;
           screening and initial enrollment in Characterization; this is a longitudinal study and&#xD;
           participants who turn 18 may continue in it until they are 25.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Design&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is a Characterization study that includes longitudinal observation of three&#xD;
           adolescent cohorts.. HV, s-MDD and MDD subjects will take part in a longitudinal,&#xD;
           observational study that involves clinical assessment, computer tasks, blood for&#xD;
           inflammatory and neuroendocrinological markers, fMRI and MEG scanning and continue to&#xD;
           return until they reach 25 years of age. A sample of young adult HVs (18-30 years old)&#xD;
           will also be enrolled as a comparison cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Adolescent patients who still suffer from MDD will be offered outpatient clinical care&#xD;
           in the form of open-label Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT; up to 26 weeks). During and&#xD;
           following outpatient clinical care, participants with MDD will continue in&#xD;
           Characterization. Upon completion of clinical care patients will return to care in the&#xD;
           community.&#xD;
&#xD;
           MDD patients who are clinically unstable and are eligible for standard clinical&#xD;
           treatment as inpatients or day-patients may enter treatment at NIH. They may do this&#xD;
           after starting in Characterization or at their initial enrollment.&#xD;
