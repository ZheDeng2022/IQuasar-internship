    <textblock>
      Despite major progress in molecular and phenotypic characterization of primary electrical&#xD;
      disorders, many (aborted) sudden cardiac deaths (SCD) occur in young victims without&#xD;
      identifiable abnormalities. Investigator recently identified, in 4 families presenting&#xD;
      unexplained SCD, a new arrhythmia entity (catecholamine-induced QT prolongation; CIQTP)&#xD;
      characterized by normal QT duration at rest but major QT lengthening during mental stress&#xD;
      test (MST).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators aim to determine the prevalence of this new phenotype in unexplained SCD and&#xD;
      identify its underlying pathophysiological mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More specifically, investigators aim to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  determine the prevalence of CIQTP in unexplained SCD and identify new affected families;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  identify the role of mental stress in QT prolongation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  identify the genetics basis underlying this life threatening disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  perform transcriptomic and electrophysiological profiling of induced pluripotent stem&#xD;
           cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CM) from CIQTP patients to identify putative&#xD;
           biomarkers and pathophysiological mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MST will be performed, additionally to the conventional screening, in families affected by&#xD;
      unexplained SCD or long QT syndrome (LQTS) referred to university hospitals of Nantes,&#xD;
      Rennes, Tours and Brest. Relevance of the MST on the different type of LQTS will be evaluated&#xD;
      and compared to conventional provocative tests (epinephrine, exercise).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole-genome sequencing will first be performed in 3 distantly affected relatives within each&#xD;
      of the 4 largest families identified. As previously performed in Nantes, analysis of the&#xD;
      shared rare variants will allow identifying gene(s) associated with the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcriptomic (high-throughput 3' Digital Gene Expression mRNA sequencing) and&#xD;
      electrophysiological (96-well automated optical recordings of action potentials and&#xD;
      patch-clamp recordings of ionic currents, using specific ion channel activators and&#xD;
      inhibitors) profiling will be performed on iPSC-CMs from 2 affected and one unaffected&#xD;
      first-degree relatives of these 4 large families.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a major cause of death in developed countries. An estimated&#xD;
      40,000 to 50,000 individuals die suddenly each year in France. Most of these deaths involve&#xD;
      elderly people and are related to coronary artery disease. However, an estimated 4000 to 5000&#xD;
      individuals between 1 and 45 years of age die suddenly each year in France. SCD often occurs&#xD;
      in young victims without identifiable ECG abnormalities and without structural defects. In&#xD;
      consequence, most SCD events in the young adult remain unexplained and are classified in an&#xD;
      elusive group known as idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigator recently identified a new arrhythmic entity (catecholamine-induced QT&#xD;
      prolongation; CIQTP) responsible for SCD and characterized by normal QT duration at rest but&#xD;
      major QT lengthening during mental stress test. The aim of this translational project is to&#xD;
      determine the prevalence of this new phenotype of rare disease in unexplained SCD and&#xD;
      identify its underlying pathophysiological mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of mental stress test could be extended to other inherited arrhythmic disease such as&#xD;
      long QT syndrome. Given the potential of identification of new affected relatives it may lead&#xD;
      to a significant reduction of the risk of sudden cardiac death recurrence in a family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main issue of this project is to describe the clinical implication and the&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanism of this new syndrome leading to SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on our recent description of this cathecholamine induced QT prolongation, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This syndrome is partly involved in the 60% of undiagnosed familial IVF after complete&#xD;
           familial screening7. Indeed, as the baseline ECG is normal without MST, identification&#xD;
           of such clinical features may be performed by mental stress test in proband and&#xD;
           relatives previously considered as unaffected by inherited arrhythmic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mental stress test will help to identify borderline cases of other inherited arrhythmia&#xD;
           such as long QT syndrome. Indeed, this inherited arrhythmia is characterised by a&#xD;
           genetic-based prolongation of the QT interval observed on the baseline ECG, however more&#xD;
           than a third of the patients present with only a slight QT prolongation at baseline.&#xD;
           Consequently, they require the use of provocation tests (e.g. exercise test and&#xD;
           adrenaline test) to unmask pathological QT prolongation18. The Investigator hypothesize&#xD;
           that MST may help to unmask this QT prolongation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Based on the autosomal inheritance mode investigator recently described for this&#xD;
           disease, investigator hypothesize that this syndrome belongs to the mendelian disorders.&#xD;
           Therefore, the investigators propose to apply a familial-based approach to identify the&#xD;
           major genes associated with the CIQTP syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scope of this project is to describe the clinical implication and the pathophysiological&#xD;
      mechanism of this new syndrome leading to sudden cardiac death. More specifically, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  determine the prevalence of CIQTP in unexplained SCD and identify new large affected&#xD;
           families&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  identify the role of mental stress in QT prolongation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  identify associated genes with the disease combining whole genome sequencing and&#xD;
           Identity By Descent analysis in large families&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  perform transcriptomic and electrophysiological profiling of induced pluripotent stem&#xD;
           cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CM) from CIQTP patients to identify putative&#xD;
           biomarkers and pathophysiological mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this translational approach, the investigators aim to describe pathophysiology and&#xD;
      clinical implication of CIQTP in sudden cardiac death. The description of this new syndrome&#xD;
      using innovative approach such as whole genome sequencing and iPSC-CM profiling may provide a&#xD;
      comprehensive and major progress in the field of unexplained SCD. Beyond the identification&#xD;
      and the care of newly affected relatives, it may help defining a genetic/pathophysiology&#xD;
      based therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators already proved that MST is a highly efficient diagnostic tool to detect&#xD;
      this new syndrome, and the investigators believe that it may also help to unmask QT&#xD;
      prolongation in silent LQTS mutation carriers. MST has the advantage of being rapid and&#xD;
      simple to apply. It could thus be of great interest to uncover familial segregation for&#xD;
      unexplained cardiac electrical defects showing autosomal dominant transmission. It could&#xD;
      additionally decrease the apparent non-penetrance encountered in LQTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tasks of the project&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task 1: determine the prevalence of CIQTP in unexplained SCD and identify new affected&#xD;
      families&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most cases of SCD before the age of 45 remain unexplained and are likely to be due to&#xD;
      inherited arrhythmic disease6. After unexplained SCD, all consecutive families referred to&#xD;
      Nantes, Rennes, Tours or Brest University Hospitals will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All available clinical proband data will be collected from the referring physicians and&#xD;
      relatives. When autopsy is performed, the probands whose diagnosis will be achievable will be&#xD;
      excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Familial screening After unexplained SCD before the age of 45, familial screening will be&#xD;
      performed in first-degree relatives and then extended to other relatives if positive. When&#xD;
      first-degree relatives are not available for screening, it will be performed in more distant&#xD;
      relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical screening will include a review of past medical history, clinical examination and&#xD;
      baseline ECG. In the absence of diagnosis after this first set of exams, stress test,&#xD;
      transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), sodium channel blocker challenge (SCBC) either with&#xD;
      ajmaline (1 mg/kg) or flecainide (2 mg/kg) and an epinephrine test23,24 will be performed.&#xD;
      Mental stress test will be additionally performed to unmask QT prolongation with normal&#xD;
      baseline ECG 25.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mental stress test protocol (appendix 2) MST will be performed as follows. Patients will be&#xD;
      placed in supine position with no explanation on the course of the test. ECG will be recorded&#xD;
      at baseline and permanently during the test. MST will be then performed abruptly according to&#xD;
      the patient's level of education (mental arithmetic, geography or names of Disney characters&#xD;
      for children) with a requirement for correct and rapid answers. MST will be considered as&#xD;
      relevant in the presence of at least a 20 beats-per-minute increase in heart rate. In case of&#xD;
      absence of a 20 beats-per-minute increase in heart rate, the test will be considered as&#xD;
      non-interpretable unless a significant prolongation of the QTc is identified. MST usually&#xD;
      lasts less than 2 minutes. A new ECG will be recorded 30 minutes after the end of the test in&#xD;
      an attempt to obtain an ECG trace with the lowest heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECG performed at baseline, during the stress test and during the pharmacological test will be&#xD;
      reviewed by two physicians blinded to the clinical and genetic status. All the data will be&#xD;
      collected in a core database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis criteria adhered to the guidelines of the latest consensus conference24,26. The&#xD;
      investigators will additionally consider a delta QTm &gt; 30 ms during epinephrine or the mental&#xD;
      stress test and a delta QTc &gt; 30 ms at 3 min after the stress test, as sufficient for&#xD;
      diagnosis of LQTS 27,28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum interval of 30 minutes between each test will be observed to enable catecholamine&#xD;
      clearance. All tests will be performed at least 5 days after interrupting each treatment that&#xD;
      could interfere with the tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is conducted according to European guidelines for clinical and genetic research.&#xD;
      Protocol approval will be obtained from institutional ethical committees. Informed written&#xD;
      consent will be obtained from each patient who agreed to participate to the clinical and&#xD;
      genetic study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Statistical analyses will be performed with Social Science® software&#xD;
      (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York). Categorical variables will be presented with their numbers and&#xD;
      percentages. The chi-square or Fisher exact test (based on expected frequency) will be used&#xD;
      to compare categorical variables between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative variables will be presented as mean ± standard deviation or median (25th; 75th).&#xD;
      Analysis of continuous variables will be performed using a t-test or Mann Whitney test based&#xD;
      on distribution. Comparisons among families will be performed using intra-familial mean value&#xD;
      or median of continuous variable in order to limit the bias toward family size. A two-sided&#xD;
      P-value of less than 0.05 will be considered to indicate statistical significance in all&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task 2: identify the role of mental stress in QT prolongation&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify the role of mental stress in QT prolongation the investigators will additionally&#xD;
      enroll positive and negative control groups in Nantes, Rennes, Tours or Brest University&#xD;
      Hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will consist in the enrolment of consecutive relatives of families affected by long QT&#xD;
      syndrome without QT prolongation at baseline. The result of this test will be compared to&#xD;
      conventional screening using exercise test and epinephrine test. Thereby, the investigators&#xD;
      aim to enroll patient further defined as carriers of the main genetic-based forms of long QT&#xD;
      syndrome (LQT1, LQT2 and LQT3, positive control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will additionally enrol a negative control group of healthy patients with&#xD;
      normal baseline ECG, no cardiac structural abnormalities and without any medication that&#xD;
      could interfere with the MST. This population will consist in relatives of families negative&#xD;
      for unexplained SCD screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis criteria and test protocol will be identical to those defined in task 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three consecutive beats will be used for each measurement and the average value obtained by&#xD;
      the two investigators will be taken into account. QT interval will be measured in DII or V5,&#xD;
      from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T-wave (defined as the intersection&#xD;
      of the tangent of the T-wave and the isoelectric line). U-wave will be excluded from the&#xD;
      measurement of the QT interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is conducted according to European guidelines for clinical and genetic research.&#xD;
      Protocol approval will be obtained from institutional ethical committees. Informed written&#xD;
      consent will be obtained from each patient who agreed to participate in the clinical and&#xD;
      genetic study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be performed with Social Science® software (IBM Corp., Armonk, New&#xD;
      York). Comparisons between groups will be performed for each clinical and ECG parameter at&#xD;
      baseline and during both tests (mental stress test, exercise test, epinephrine test).&#xD;
      Categorical variables will be presented with their numbers and percentages. The chi-square or&#xD;
      Fisher exact test (based on expected frequency) will be used to compare categorical variables&#xD;
      between groups. Quantitative variables will be presented as mean ± standard deviation or&#xD;
      median (25th; 75th). Analysis of continuous variables will be performed using a t-test or&#xD;
      Mann Whitney test based on distribution. A two-sided P-value of less than 0.05 will be&#xD;
      considered to indicate statistical significance in all tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigator have already enrolled in Nantes hospital a population of 30 healthy controls and&#xD;
      25 subjects affected with LQTS (LQT1=9 or LQT2=16) but with a resting QTc&lt;480 ms. First&#xD;
      results have identified a sensitivity of exercise test, epinephrine test and MST respectively&#xD;
      of 60%, 95% and 94% within the families, and 76%, 93% and 92% within the positive controls,&#xD;
      for a specificity of 100% reached for every test. This confirms that MST test may be of&#xD;
      interest in long QT patients with an absence of clear QT prolongation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task 3: identify specific genes associated with the disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To identify rare variants in new genes contributing strongly the risk of VF within&#xD;
      pedigrees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four large IVF families presenting 6 SCD (with 2 resuscitated) and 7 unexplained syncope&#xD;
      episodes occurring at young age have been characterized in Nantes. Among them, respectively&#xD;
      9, 10, 11, and 4 family members show a prolonged QT interval after MST and/or another&#xD;
      provocative test while all LQTS-associated genes were negative. The description of this new&#xD;
      clinical entity has been recently accepted for publication in the Journal of the American&#xD;
      College of Cardiology17. The occurrence of VF/SCD or ECG abnormalities in genetically distant&#xD;
      individuals within families makes pedigrees highly powerful for genetic studies, since the&#xD;
      greater the genetic distance, the less variants the patients will share. Of note additional&#xD;
      relatives will be clinically investigated (individual with question mark symbols on pedigrees&#xD;
      below) and may increase the power of the genetics study. Previous works of J. Barc and Nantes&#xD;
      group demonstrated our capability to lead such ambitious projects and specifically on gene&#xD;
      discovery based on familial approach coupled to next generation sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      task3.1: Whole genome genotyping and analysis of the affected family members Aim: Identify a&#xD;
      genomic region shared by the affected members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genome-wide genotyping on all affected family members will be performed using Axiom&#xD;
      Genome-Wide Human Precision Medicine Research Array (PMRA) Plate on Affymetrix GeneTitan®&#xD;
      Multi-Channel, instrument available through the genomic core facility of Nantes of our lab.&#xD;
      Genomic regions shared by affected family members will be assessed by Identity By Descent&#xD;
      (IBD) analysis as previously described. This step is crucial to refine the genome region&#xD;
      where the causal variant is located. According the large size of the families the&#xD;
      investigators can expect that a relatively small genomic region will come up from this&#xD;
      analysis. Attention will be dedicated to potential shared region among families that would&#xD;
      indicate a potential common gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      task3.2: Whole genome sequencing and analysis Aim: identify rare variants among the genomic&#xD;
      regions shared by affected family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here the investigators shall carry out genome sequencing in 3 distantly related individuals&#xD;
      affected by CIQTP syndrome from each of the 4 pedigrees. Advantages with genome sequencing&#xD;
      reside on the absence of capturing and PCR steps, limiting strongly the capture artefacts,&#xD;
      the non-covered regions and offering the possibility of uncovering a mutation within an&#xD;
      essential regulatory element belonging to the non-coding region. Sequencing will be performed&#xD;
      in collaboration with the National Genotyping Center (CEA-CNG). The NGS pipeline follows the&#xD;
      recommendations of the Broad Institute GATK &quot;Best Practices&quot;&#xD;
      broadinstitute.org/gatk/guide/best-practices.php. Basically, reads are mapped using bwa-mem,&#xD;
      Duplicates are removed using picard, GATK is used to realign and recalibrate the reads. The&#xD;
      variants are called with HaplotypeCaller and are recalibrated with GATK. The generated VCFs&#xD;
      are then annotated with Ensembl Variant Effect predictor. From VCF files and within each&#xD;
      pedigree, the investigators shall prioritize variants shared by the 3 affected individuals&#xD;
      and contained within shared genomic regions (IBD). From the shared variants the investigators&#xD;
      shall focus on rare variants and then filter out variants that are common in the general&#xD;
      population (minor allele frequency &gt;0.1%). For this the investigators will use public and&#xD;
      in-house exome/genome databases gathering in total about 130 000 exomes and 20 000 genomes&#xD;
      such as The gnomAD consortium, 1000Genomes, the Genome of the Netherlands and demographic&#xD;
      matched controls specifically from Nantes area (PREGO study-www.vacarme-project.org). This is&#xD;
      expected to result in a short-list of few &quot;candidate&quot; variants/genes per family. A&#xD;
      bioinformatics prediction of their functional effect will be assessed by the programs SIFT&#xD;
      and Polyphen2 to highlight putative malignant variants among those. The investigators will&#xD;
      validate all variants identified in such way by Sanger sequencing and investigate their&#xD;
      co-segregation with other affected family members in the respective pedigrees. Experience of&#xD;
      the genomics and bioinformatics core facility of Nantes of our lab, which are recognized as&#xD;
      French national infrastructures in genomics (IBiSA) and bioinformatics (Institut Français de&#xD;
      Bioinformatique) coupled to our experience in NGS data managing will assure the feasibility&#xD;
      of this Task. Furthermore a large genome sequencing project gathering more than 1000 whole&#xD;
      genome (including cardiac patients and individuals from the general population) is on going&#xD;
      in our group. Experience from this project will reinforce the efficiency of the task#3&#xD;
      analysis and chance of success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task 4: perform transcriptomic and electrophysiological profiling of induced pluripotent stem&#xD;
      cell-derived cardiomyocytes from CIQTP patients to identify putative biomarkers and&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanisms&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators make the hypothesis that induced pluripotent stem cell-derived&#xD;
      cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) generated from CIQPT patients will allow us to identify the global&#xD;
      gene expression changes and electrophysiological alterations associated with the disease. For&#xD;
      that, the investigators aim at comparing iPSC-CMs generated from members of the 4 families&#xD;
      described in task 3. Within each pedigree the investigators will select one &quot;control&quot; healthy&#xD;
      subject (not presenting the familial QT prolongation), and 2 CIPQT patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positive LQT control and negative healthy control iPS cell lines have already been generated&#xD;
      and studied in Nantes in a context of a previous study on LQT2 demonstrating the feasibility&#xD;
      of this task. This will also offer the opportunity to compare CIPQT transcriptomic and&#xD;
      electrophysiological signature to LTQ2 ones. For each line, 3 iPS cell clones have been&#xD;
      validated: all lines have normal karyotype and meet the current standards for pluripotency.&#xD;
      The investigators successfully differentiated the iPS cells into the cardiac lineage, using a&#xD;
      recently described method based on temporal modulation of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling using small&#xD;
      molecules. Preliminary data suggest that the investigators can generate high purity and&#xD;
      efficiency of cardiac differentiation. Regarding the iPS cells from the LQT2 patient, the&#xD;
      investigators showed that hERG A561P mutation leads to a trafficking defect that results in&#xD;
      reduced IKr current, and consequently e to action potential prolongation and cellular&#xD;
      arrhythmias(early afterdepolarizations) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon obtainment and validation of all iPS cell lines, the first step of the project will&#xD;
      consist in the identification of the cardiac gene expression profile associated with CIQTP.&#xD;
      For that, the investigators will use cardiomyocytes differentiated from control and&#xD;
      patient-derived iPS cells (day 28) to perform RNA seq analyses, in collaboration with the&#xD;
      Genomics core facility of our lab. The investigators will also perform high-throughput action&#xD;
      potential and ionic current analyses using automated patch clamp and optical based&#xD;
      (CellOptiq®) techniques under baseline conditions and after drug-induced adrenergic&#xD;
      stimulation. All combined, these analyses will provide us with the first identification of&#xD;
      the electrophysiological profile associated with CIQTP in human cardiomyocytes. With this&#xD;
      analysis, the investigators will be able to link CIQTP-associated altered gene expression&#xD;
      program to defective cardiac physiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iPSC cardiac differentiation protocols: cells will be cultured on a Matrigel-coated plate and&#xD;
      exposed to cardiogenic cytokines: CHIR and IWR-1. Beating colonies appear after about 10&#xD;
      days. After 20 days, cells will be dissociated and reseeded for electrophysiological&#xD;
      analyses, 10 days later. Finally, after 28 days of differentiation, beating cells will be&#xD;
      collected for RNA seq analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq): beating iPSC-CMs at 28 days of 3 differentiation&#xD;
      from 2 clones of each iPS cell line will be collected and RNA will be extracted using&#xD;
      Macherey-Nagel kit. Presence and quantity of each RNA of the samples will then be assessed&#xD;
      using next generation sequencing (Illumina HiSeq technology). Bioinformatics analysis will be&#xD;
      performed by the BIRD core facility of our lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ionic current recordings by automated patch clamp: CIQTP's repolarization defects likely&#xD;
      reflect dysfunction of specific ionic currents that will be recorded using whole cell&#xD;
      patch-clamp: sodium current, INa, calcium current, ICa,L, and potassium currents, IKs and&#xD;
      IKr.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Action potential recording: This recording will be performed using 2 techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Isolated beating cells will be analyzed using perforated patch-clamp technique with&#xD;
           amphotericin B at 37oC. Patch pipettes will be filled with a solution that has an ionic&#xD;
           composition similar to the intracellular fluid.&#xD;

        2. Action potential optical recordings will be performed on cardiomyocytes after 28 days of&#xD;
           differentiation, with 5 µmol/L di-8-ANEPPS as the voltage-sensitive dye using the&#xD;
           CellOptiq® technology (Clyde Biosciences). Cells will be incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 and&#xD;
           20% O2 during the 2 h-incubation of the dye and during the recording.&#xD;

        Patients will be recruited by the Hereditary or rare heart rhythm disorders reference&#xD;
        centre of the Nantes University Hospital, which specialises in the management of patients&#xD;
        with sudden death risk pathologies and family screening. The reference centre works in&#xD;
        network with the regional competence centres, including the Brest, Rennes and Tours&#xD;
        University Hospital Centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be included in a cardiological consultation or day hospitalization as part of&#xD;
        the family screening for sudden death. Family screening is carried out within the usual&#xD;
        framework of patient care and in accordance with international recommendations.&#xD;
