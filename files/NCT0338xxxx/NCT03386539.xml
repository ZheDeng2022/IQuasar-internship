    <textblock>
      The TEAMMATE Trial will enroll 210 pediatric heart transplant patients from 25 centers at 6&#xD;
      months post-transplant and follow each patient for 2.5 years. Half of the participants will&#xD;
      receive everolimus and low-dose tacrolimus and the other half will receive tacrolimus and&#xD;
      mycophenolate mofetil. The trial will determine which treatment is better at reducing the&#xD;
      cumulative risk of coronary artery vasculopathy, chronic kidney disease and biopsy&#xD;
      proven-acute cellular rejection without an increase in graft loss due to all causes (e.g.&#xD;
      infection, PTLD, antibody mediated rejection).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Median survival after pediatric heart transplantation (HT) is 15 years in the current era.&#xD;
      This means that a substantial fraction of patients transplanted during childhood fail to&#xD;
      survive to adulthood, or require heart re-transplantation, because of complications related&#xD;
      to heart transplant. These complications include heart transplant rejection, infection,&#xD;
      coronary artery disease, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD; a form of&#xD;
      lymphoma seen in transplant recipients), and kidney failure. Most complications stem not from&#xD;
      the heart transplant itself, but from the drugs commonly used to suppress the immune system&#xD;
      in order to prevent rejection. In the US, tacrolimus (TAC) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF),&#xD;
      have emerged over the past decade as the standard of care for pediatric heart transplant&#xD;
      immunosuppression. While pediatric survival has improved significantly in the era of TAC and&#xD;
      MMF, post-HT complications remain a major problem that limits median survival to 15 years.&#xD;
      Recently, everolimus (EVL) has emerged as a potential alternative immunosuppressant that may&#xD;
      prevent rejection, coronary artery disease and kidney failure more effectively than TAC/MMF&#xD;
      when administered in combination with low-dose tacrolimus (LDTAC). Preliminary studies&#xD;
      suggest that EVL, and its first-generation analog sirolimus, are well tolerated in children&#xD;
      after HT, regardless of whether it is started in response to coronary artery disease, in&#xD;
      response to chronic kidney disease, or empirically 4-6 months after transplant in an effort&#xD;
      to prevent the development of these complications1. However, studies are generally limited to&#xD;
      single-center experiences using historical controls and have inadequate statistical power to&#xD;
      demonstrate treatment differences. This will be the first multicenter randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial of maintenance immunosuppression in pediatric heart transplantation to systematically&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of EVL with LDTAC vs. TAC/MMF to prevent long-term&#xD;
      complications which lead to death/graft loss. The major adverse transplant event (MATE) score&#xD;
      will serve as the primary endpoint to power the trial. Because no Food &amp; Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA)-approved immunosuppressants currently exist for children after heart transplant (all&#xD;
      prescriptions are off-label) and market incentives to support a trial are limited, the&#xD;
      investigators have funded the trial through a Fiscal Year 2016 Peer Reviewed Medical Research&#xD;
      Program Clinical Trial Award sponsored by the Department of Defense office of the&#xD;
      Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs. It is worth noting that in contrast to&#xD;
      adults, children have a substantially longer potential life expectancy if post-transplant&#xD;
      complications can be minimized, making the prevention of late complications an urgent&#xD;
      priority for the pediatric heart transplant community.&#xD;
