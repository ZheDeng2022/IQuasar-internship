      To compare the effects and safety of Anlotinib Plus Irinotecan versus Irinotecan in patients&#xD;
      with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma(ESCC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, anti-angiogenic therapy has made some progress in the treatment of advanced&#xD;
      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.In clinical use, the efficacy of antiangiogenic&#xD;
      monotherapy was low, with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of only 3 to 4 months.We&#xD;
      conducted a randomized, open clinical Trial to evaluate efficacy and safety of anlotinib&#xD;
      hydrochloride combined with irinotecan versus irinotecan monotherapy in patients with&#xD;
      advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.&#xD;

    <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also have demonstrated an absolute increase of ≥5 mm.</description>
