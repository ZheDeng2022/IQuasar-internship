  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a common complication in the stem cell transplant&#xD;
      population. Certain populations within the hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)&#xD;
      population are at a higher risk than others. Defibrotide is an endothelial stabilizing agent&#xD;
      which may prevent the endothelial damage that triggers TMA in HSCT patients. The feasibility,&#xD;
      safety, and efficacy of defibrotide prophylaxis in a pediatric transplant population is&#xD;
      unknown. Twenty five patients age 0 to 30 years receiving autologous or allogeneic&#xD;
      hematopoeitic stem cell transplant who meet TMA high risk criteria will be enrolled. Patients&#xD;
      will receive Defibrotide for 28-35 days starting before conditioning, and will be closely&#xD;
      monitored for any adverse events up through 6 months post-transplant. The feasibility of&#xD;
      administering defibrotide will be evaluated as well as incidence of TMA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm pilot study of defibrotide given as prophylaxis to patients&#xD;
      receiving a conditioned stem cell transplant for the purpose of preventing post-transplant&#xD;
      microangiopathy. The University of California San Francisco Blood and Marrow Transplant&#xD;
      program reviewed all cases of non-relapse related death from 2012 through 2015 and identified&#xD;
      a complication of endothelial injury known as transplant associated thrombotic&#xD;
      microangiopathy (TMA) as the most common cause of transplant related mortality in its patient&#xD;
      population. TMA is a multi-system disease in which widespread endothelial injury leads to&#xD;
      microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, intravascular platelet activation and formation of thrombi&#xD;
      within the microcirculation. Diagnosis of TMA can be difficult as systemic signs and symptoms&#xD;
      of TMA are often similar to other common transplant complications, such as medication induced&#xD;
      hypertension and cytopenias. The reported prevalence of TMA is varied likely due to&#xD;
      diagnostic uncertainty and transplant center expertise, but large retrospective studies have&#xD;
      reported it as 10-39%, with the majority of cases occurring in the first 100 days after&#xD;
      transplant. Of the patients who develop TMA, approximately half of them will develop severe&#xD;
      disease. Outcomes are poor with a reported 30-50% mortality rate and as high as 80% in&#xD;
      patients with severe disease. Furthermore, survivors of TMA may have significant morbidity&#xD;
      (e.g. renal failure and need for long-term dialysis, heart failure, and significantly&#xD;
      prolonged hospital admission). There is no gold standard of treatment for TMA. Supportive&#xD;
      care includes renal support, discontinuation of calcineurin inhibitors, and treatment of&#xD;
      infections. Treatment options include plasma exchange, complement cascade blockade, and&#xD;
      defibrotide. Early treatment is crucial to decrease morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the early recognition and treatment of TMA, poor outcomes occur when patients are&#xD;
      treated with complement blockade alone. This suggests that complement activation may trigger&#xD;
      a complex cascade of parallel inflammatory mediators that lead to end organ damage&#xD;
      independent of the complement pathway. The goal is to prevent TMA whenever possible via&#xD;
      augmentation of endothelial repair. Defibrotide is an anticoagulant and fibrinolytic agent&#xD;
      that has been shown to be an effective treatment in other endothelial disorders such as&#xD;
      hepatic veno-occlusive disease. It is a polydeoxyribonucleotide salt that blocks plasminogen&#xD;
      activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and attenuates the effect of tumor necrosis factor. It also&#xD;
      increases prostaglandin E2 and prostacyclin levels which alters the platelet activity&#xD;
      adhesion and aggregation and relaxes the smooth muscle of blood vessel walls. All of this&#xD;
      likely protects the endothelium from damage. It has been shown that patients with TMA who&#xD;
      were treated with defibrotide had a 77% response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of defibrotide in the context of veno occlusive disease (VOD) treatment and&#xD;
      prevention has been studied extensively, including a landmark report showing that defibrotide&#xD;
      given to children during stem cell transplant conditioning is safe and effective in the&#xD;
      prevention of veno-occlusive disease. Also, defibrotide showed a 67-77% response rate when&#xD;
      used as treatment in patients who developed TMA. However, there has not been a prospective&#xD;
      study to show that such prophylaxis is effective in the prevention of TMA in pediatric&#xD;
      patients undergoing hematopoetic stem cell transplant (HCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive Defibrotide 6.25mg/kg via two hour intravenous infusions given every 6&#xD;
      hours. Defibrotide will start the day before conditioning is initiated, and will last for 28&#xD;
      to 35 days. During defibrotide administration, participants will have assessments of&#xD;
      administration feasibility, hypersensitivity reaction, and bleeding. All hematopoietic stem&#xD;
      cell transplant standard of care evaluations will be conducted, including routine clinical&#xD;
      evaluations and laboratory assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for 6 months post-HSCT, or until death, whichever occurs first. All&#xD;
      patients will be evaluated for toxicity from the time of their first treatment with the study&#xD;
      drug. The study will use the CTCAE v4.03 for reporting of non-hematologic adverse events and&#xD;
      modified criteria for hematologic adverse events. Patients removed from study for&#xD;
      unacceptable treatment related adverse event(s) will be followed until resolution or&#xD;
      stabilization of all treatment-related adverse events to Grade 2 or lower.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarkers indicative of endothelial damage and TMA activity will be drawn to assess&#xD;
      subclinical TMA activity as well as risk for subsequent development of TMA while on&#xD;
      defibrotide. These include plasma free hemoglobin, suppression of tumorigenicity,&#xD;
      angiopoietin 2, and plasminogen activator inhibitor - 1. Study labs will be assessed at 4&#xD;
      time points prior to Day +21, and at diagnosis of TMA.&#xD;

    <limitations_and_caveats>Limitations include:&#xD;
Small single institution non-randomized trial. Combination of two separate patient populations at high-risk for TA-TMA allowed for a more robust study, but smaller numbers of patients in each of the groups limits sub-analysis.&#xD;
Some interesting preliminary findings with study biomarkers but the study is too small to draw definitive conclusions regarding utility.&#xD;
No current CLIA-approved lab measuring ANG-2, limiting applicability of this test to the clinical setting.</limitations_and_caveats>
