  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced/metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with no documented&#xD;
      targetable alterations (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation, Anaplastic Lymphoma&#xD;
      Kinase (ALK) translocation, ROS1 mutation if available or MET exon 14 skipping mutation if&#xD;
      available) will receive a tri-therapy associating avelumab, axitinib and palbociclib.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the Phase 1 (approximately 30 patients), the tri-therapy will be tested at different&#xD;
      doses following a specific dose-escalation scheme (3 + 3 model) in order to establish the&#xD;
      safety and identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and recommended dose (RP2D) for the&#xD;
      Phase 2. The phase 2 will confirm the safety and will assess the clinical utility of the&#xD;
      tri-therapy approach in the treatment of advanced/metastatic NSCLC (100 patients). The study&#xD;
      will also explore the clinical utility of the Simplified Interventional Mapping System&#xD;
      (SIMS), a new tool/algorithm enabling matching of NSCLC patients with combination therapy.&#xD;
      For this purpose tumor/metastasis and matched normal tissue biopsies will be requested in&#xD;
      order to obtain sequencing and expression profiles.&#xD;
