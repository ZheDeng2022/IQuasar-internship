  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the MOIST study it will be assessed whether the adapted Sternberg short-term working&#xD;
      memory task (STMST) is an effective method to induce malodor formation by emotional stress,&#xD;
      as assessed by expert assessments of stress-induced malodor formation in the armpits of 30&#xD;
      healthy male volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before, during and after being exposed to the adapted version of the STMST, saliva will be&#xD;
      collected to determine cortisol levels, subjects have to rate their momentary feelings of&#xD;
      anxiety and embarrassment and heart rate variability will be monitored continuously with a&#xD;
      wireless signal transmission device. Before and after exposure to the adapted STMST, malodor&#xD;
      levels will be assessed by two expert judges, axillary volatiles will be collected by cup&#xD;
      scrubbing and microbiota samples will be taken to determine microbial species.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stress is a primary physiological response to physical and/or social threats resulting from a&#xD;
      complex interplay of neurophysiological and psychological factors. Cognitive interpretations&#xD;
      of social-evaluative threats have been found to be very potent emotional stressors. Apocrine&#xD;
      sweat glands are stimulated by emotional stress, fear or mental tension. Upon secretion,&#xD;
      apocrine sweat is odorless. By enzymatic action of the bacterial microbiome on apocrine sweat&#xD;
      in particular, body malodor is formed. This is perceived as offensive by most societies. As a&#xD;
      result, self-confidence and social relationships can be influenced by undesired body odor. A&#xD;
      good understanding of the complex sweat-microbiome interactions leading to malodor formation&#xD;
      is required for the development of effective malodor remedies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the MOIST study it will be assessed whether the adapted Sternberg short-term working&#xD;
      memory task (STMST) is an effective method to induce malodor formation by emotional stress,&#xD;
      as assessed by expert assessments of stress-induced malodor formation in the armpits of 30&#xD;
      healthy male volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
