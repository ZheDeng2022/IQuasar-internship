  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to utilize quantitative and qualitative methodology to better&#xD;
      understand the impact of multiple drug use (polypharmacy) on medication adherence as well as&#xD;
      the driving forces behind differential adherence in people living with HIV (PLWH) with&#xD;
      comorbidities. Since the clinical relevance of differential adherence to antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy (ART) medication has already been demonstrated and associated with virologic failure&#xD;
      and a more rapid progression to AIDS and death, it is imperative to understand the driving&#xD;
      forces behind differential adherence (selective drug taking) and its impact on treatment&#xD;
      outcomes in PLWH with comorbidities. To this end, the investigators propose utilizing&#xD;
      self-report adherence data and abstracted medical record data including pharmacy refills to&#xD;
      assess medication adherence among PLWH with comorbidities. The information gained regarding&#xD;
      patients' clinical outcomes as well as patients' reported treatment adherence, quality of&#xD;
      life, beliefs about medications, and treatment satisfaction will provide the investigators&#xD;
      with a comprehensive picture of what constitutes successful HIV treatment among those PLWH&#xD;
      managing multiple medications. This is particularly important as non-successful treatment may&#xD;
      result in low patient satisfaction, breach of patient-provider trust and reduced medication&#xD;
      adherence.&#xD;

      Primary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication adherence: The investigators will assess medication adherence at baseline and at&#xD;
      six months using the following measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Self-reported adherence to ART using the AIDS-ACTG questionnaire will be assessed at&#xD;
           baseline and six months. To measure medication adherence to ART the investigators will&#xD;
           use the validated AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) Adherence Questionnaire. This&#xD;
           assessment is considered one of the &quot;gold-standard&quot; ART self-reported adherence&#xD;
           questionnaires. The questionnaire assesses the number of doses missed per medication per&#xD;
           day over a recall period of the previous four days. Mean number of doses missed is&#xD;
           calculated for all ART medications over the four days. In addition, the ACTG&#xD;
           questionnaire includes secondary assessments of adherence including a general time-frame&#xD;
           question regarding the last time the participant missed taking any medications and an&#xD;
           assessment of reasons as to why medications were skipped if they were skipped.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Medication adherence using pharmacy refills will be assessed at baseline (using the&#xD;
           prior 6 months of pharmacy refill data) and at six months post-intervention (to assess&#xD;
           the study period pharmacy refill data). Since self-report measures can be biased by&#xD;
           inaccurate patient recall or by social desirability, the investigators will also measure&#xD;
           medication adherence using pharmacy refill data. Adherence using pharmacy refills has&#xD;
           been correlated with a wide range of outcomes for patients with cardiovascular as well&#xD;
           as other diseases. To measure medication adherence using pharmacy refills the&#xD;
           investigators will use the proportion of days covered (PDC) which is used when multiple&#xD;
           medications are used concomitantly. PDC = number of days covered by prescription&#xD;
           fills/number of days between the first prescription fills during the measurement period&#xD;
           and the end of the measurement period (180 days). The patients' will have two&#xD;
           measurement periods: 1) 6 months prior to enrollment and 2) the study period beginning&#xD;
           on the date of enrollment (index date) and extending through the last day of the study&#xD;
           period (six months) or until the last day of follow-up due to death or disenrollment. It&#xD;
           is important to note that PDC calculates the days when the patient is covered for all&#xD;
           medications in a regimen for the particular study period. The investigators will assess&#xD;
           not only the overall medication adherence, but also adherence to each medication. The&#xD;
           research team has access to all Northwell-Vivo pharmacies' refill data as that&#xD;
           information is linked to patients' electronic medical records. In addition,&#xD;
           Investigators will be able to access other local pharmacy data (including Specialty&#xD;
           Pharmacies) as well as mail-order pharmacy data. Moreover, if a patient is admitted to&#xD;
           the hospital at any point during the study period and receives medications from hospital&#xD;
           supply, the additional medications will be added.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will measure treatment adherence (compliance) according to International&#xD;
      Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research. Medication adherence will be calculated&#xD;
      as a compliance rate over the entire study period. Compliance rate (CR) = number of doses&#xD;
      taken/number of doses prescribed over the 180 day study period. This can be calculated&#xD;
      overall and per medication prescribed. On the basis of self-report and pharmacy refills&#xD;
      patients with non- ART medication adherence of 80% and ART medication adherence of &gt;95% will&#xD;
      be categorized as adherent. The investigators have chosen a cut-off percentage of &gt;95% for&#xD;
      ART medications because it has been shown that drug resistance is most common among patients&#xD;
      with a medication adherence rate of &lt;95%. Therefore, PLWH must adhere to their ART regimen at&#xD;
      a rate of &gt;95% to avert physiological deterioration due to HIV rebound. Moreover, the 80%&#xD;
      cut-off percentage have been used widely in observational and randomized controlled studies&#xD;
      on non-ART medication adherence (diabetes and cardiovascular drugs) and these definitions of&#xD;
      sub-optimal adherence have been associated with moderate to severe adverse outcomes.&#xD;
      Combination tablets will be counted as one medication. Only prescribed medication will be&#xD;
      included in the medication adherence calculations. Vitamins and OTC will not be included, but&#xD;
      they will be analyzed in secondary analyses (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life (QoL) will be assessed at baseline and six months: The investigators will use&#xD;
      the World Health Organization HIV QoL Brief Scale (WHOQOL-HIV BREF) which is a widely used,&#xD;
      validated scale to assess QoL indicators that are most relevant to PLWH. It has sound&#xD;
      psychometric properties in use with similar populations. The scale consists of 26 items that&#xD;
      measure HIV-specific aspects of QoL. It generates four dimensions on 5-point Likert scales&#xD;
      including physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environment.This&#xD;
      instrument usually takes less than five minutes to complete. The raw scores on the subscales&#xD;
      are converted into transformed scores ranging from 4-20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' illness-specific symptoms and medication-specific side effects will be assessed at&#xD;
      baseline and at six months: The investigators will assess illness-specific symptoms and&#xD;
      medication-specific side effects (MSSE using the HIV Symptom Index Questionnaire (HIV-SIQ).&#xD;
      HIV-SIQ is a validated instrument that assesses a total of 20 symptoms on a 5-point Likert&#xD;
      scale which also assesses symptom severity. Patients will be asked if the symptom is&#xD;
      associated with HIV or the other comorbidity or both. If the symptom is attributed to one&#xD;
      illness, then the patient will be asked if it is a consequence of the illness or felt to be&#xD;
      due to a medication side- effect. The sum of the symptoms attributed to the illness will&#xD;
      constitute the ISS, whereas the number or the sum of the symptoms attributed to medication&#xD;
      will constitute the MSSE. This information will be collected and analyzed at the end of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' beliefs about medication s will be assessed at baseline only: The investigators&#xD;
      will use the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire[(BMQ) to assess patients' reasoning behind&#xD;
      adherence or non-adherence (e.g., level of fear about not taking medication). The BMQ in the&#xD;
      appendix is specific for HIV but it will be adapted to the specific patient' chronic&#xD;
      condition(s). Data on patients' beliefs about HIV and comorbidity medications will be&#xD;
      collected through a questionnaire consisting of 18 questions with a 5-point Likert response&#xD;
      scale, ranging from 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree). Items are altered for other&#xD;
      comorbidities and HIV specifically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' illness perceptions will be assessed at baseline and at six months: The&#xD;
      investigators will use the revised version of the Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ) to&#xD;
      assess patients' own personal beliefs about their illnesses and their treatments, and their&#xD;
      emotional responses towards the treatments. The IPQ was originally developed for cancer&#xD;
      patients, but it has been revised to accommodate PLWH and other chronic conditions. Patients&#xD;
      will complete the questionnaire in response to each of their chronic conditions (including&#xD;
      HIV). The IPQ is a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire ranging from 1 (strongly agree) to 5&#xD;
      (strongly disagree).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' pill burden perceptions will be assessed at baseline only: The investigators will&#xD;
      query patients regarding their perceptions of pill burden using the Pill Burden Questionnaire&#xD;
      (PBQ). The PBQ, developed by Zhou et al.,19 consists of five questions with answers ranging&#xD;
      from: 1) strongly agree; 2) disagree; 3) neither agree nor disagree.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health care utilization (hospitalization rates, urgent care center and ER visits) will be&#xD;
      assessed prospectively at baseline and at six months and retrospectively 6 months prior&#xD;
      patients' enrollment: The investigators will use the electronic medical record (EMR) system,&#xD;
      information from Healthix (the Regional Health Information Organization) and self-report to&#xD;
      record hospital utilization (i.e., hospitalization rates, urgent care center and ER visits).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus groups: Two focus groups will be conducted to understand the driving forces behind&#xD;
      differential adherence and to understand the impact of number of chronic medications on&#xD;
      differential adherence. One focus group will consist of 10 randomly selected patients taking&#xD;
      between two and four medications and the other will consist of 10 patients taking at &gt;5&#xD;
      (methodology described below), in order to better understand patient-related as well as&#xD;
      non-patient-related factors that could be potentially associated with non-adherence including&#xD;
      number of chronic medications. Patient-related factors may include forgetfulness, adherence&#xD;
      fatigue, lack of routinization, poor understanding of the relationship between non-adherence&#xD;
      and disease progression, depression, anxiety, drug misuse and patient-physician relationship,&#xD;
      whereas non-patient-related factors may include environmental factors such as, inconvenience&#xD;
      of treatment, insurance-related issues/limitations, poor access to healthcare and medications&#xD;
      or medication factors such as complexity of regimen and side effects. The investigators will&#xD;
      query as to whether adherence patterns vary by medication and what factors, if any, drive&#xD;
      differential adherence such as, fear of consequences of non-adherence, symptom burden,&#xD;
      medication side effects, and prioritization of one illness over another. The investigators&#xD;
      also will discuss patients' perceptions of pill burden, which may impact medication&#xD;
      adherence. The term &quot;pill burden&quot; refers not only to the number of pills that a patient is&#xD;
      taking daily, but it is also a function of the difficulty [i.e., pill size, pill form&#xD;
      (capsule vs tablet), and method of ingestion (swallow vs chew)] patients have with taking the&#xD;
      prescribed doses.&#xD;
