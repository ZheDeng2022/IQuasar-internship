    <textblock>
      In the present study, the investigators aim to investigate postprandial physiology in&#xD;
      patients who have had the Aspire AssistÂ® inserted. This will involve a standardised mixed&#xD;
      meal test (MMT) with subsequent aspiration of gastric content compared to MMT without&#xD;
      aspiration. Furthermore, a comparison will be made between the aspiration group and a control&#xD;
      group in order to evaluate whether continuous treatment with aspiration therapy affect the&#xD;
      postprandial physiology. The primary outcomes of the trial are differences in postprandial&#xD;
      plasma/serum glucose, insulin and gut hormone excursions during MMT with and without&#xD;
      aspiration. Secondary outcomes encompass evaluation of satiety, gastric emptying and&#xD;
      gallbladder motility following MMT with and without aspiration. Also, food intake during a&#xD;
      subsequent ad libitum meal will be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is generally agreed that the increasing incidence of obesity mainly is caused by the&#xD;
      adoption of a sedentary lifestyle combined with excessive caloric intake. So far, preventive&#xD;
      measures and interventions based on lifestyle modifications have not been able to affect the&#xD;
      western lifestyle to a degree that remedies the increasing prevalence of obesity. Likewise,&#xD;
      no medical interventions have yet been able to induce and maintain significant major weight&#xD;
      loss in obese populations. In contrast, bariatric surgery prompts a significant and often&#xD;
      sustained weight loss, which frequently triggers remission of obesity-related comorbidities.&#xD;
      However, bariatric surgery is invasive, irreversible and costly. Aspiration therapy was&#xD;
      introduced as a less invasive and cheaper treatment for obesity. According to some studies,&#xD;
      aspiration therapy is nearly as effective as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in terms of excess&#xD;
      weight loss after one year. Thus, aspiration therapy may aspire as an alternative treatment&#xD;
      option for obesity with lower risk of complications than bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of developing impaired glucose tolerance and overt type 2 diabetes rises along with&#xD;
      increasing obesity. The estimated risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases 3-fold with a&#xD;
      body mass index (BMI) of 25-29.9 kg/m2 (overweight) and ~20-fold with a BMI &gt;35 kg/m2&#xD;
      (severely obese) compared to a normal BMI (&lt;25 kg/m2) (6). Type 2 diabetes is a complex,&#xD;
      multi-organ metabolic disorder and is associated with serious complications, reduced quality&#xD;
      of life and early death. The disease is characterized by hyperglycaemia and, thus, elevated&#xD;
      haemoglobinA1c (HbA1c) (&gt;6.5% or &gt;48mmol/mol), which is a blood parameter used clinically as&#xD;
      a measure of mean blood glucose over time (~3 months). Studies have shown that up to 70% of&#xD;
      the mean plasma glucose levels is caused by postprandial plasma glucose excursions. Moreover,&#xD;
      postprandial hyperglycaemia in itself seems to be associated with an elevated risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease due to unfavourable effect on both small and large blood vessels.&#xD;
      Accordingly, postprandial hyperglycaemia has been suggested to constitute a better predictor&#xD;
      of mortality risk than fasting plasma glucose concentrations in both patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes and individuals with normal glucose tolerance. Since the prevalence of impaired&#xD;
      glucose tolerance is ~2-fold higher in obese compared to lean individuals, postprandial&#xD;
      hyperglycaemia poses a great risk of developing severe comorbidities such as cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease and type 2 diabetes for obese individuals and may increase mortality in this group.&#xD;
      It is yet unknown whether aspiration therapy can attenuate the plasma glucose response to a&#xD;
      meal. Due to the reduced amount of food reaching the intestine after aspiration, it seems&#xD;
      likely that aspiration therapy reduces postprandial plasma glucose excursions and thereby&#xD;
      prevents potential postprandial hyperglycaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well known that an orally administered glucose load elicits a greater insulin secretion&#xD;
      response compared to an intravenous infusion of glucose resulting in identical plasma glucose&#xD;
      elevations. This phenomenon is called the incretin effect. The incretin effect is primarily&#xD;
      driven by the insulinotropic gut hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and&#xD;
      glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). These so-called incretin hormones play&#xD;
      crucial roles in regulation of glucose homeostasis and appetite. GLP-1 is produced in the&#xD;
      intestinal mucosa by the so-called enteroendocrine L cells, which are predominantly localised&#xD;
      in the distal part of the small intestine and the colon. GIP originates from enteroendocrine&#xD;
      K 5 cells in the gut mucosa. K cells are assumed to be predominant in the proximal part of&#xD;
      the small intestine. Both GLP-1 and GIP are secreted in response to ingestion of nutrients&#xD;
      and have strong glucose-dependent insulinotropic effects on pancreatic beta cells. The&#xD;
      incretin hormones are of interest in the present study, because impaired incretin effect is&#xD;
      an early sign of dysmetabolism in obese individuals and a distinctive feature of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes, suggesting that the impaired glucose tolerance of these patients is, at least in&#xD;
      part, due to a defective incretin system. Whether aspiration of gastric content after a meal&#xD;
      affects postprandial incretin hormone response has not been elucidated. The investigators&#xD;
      plan to investigate meal-induced incretin hormone excursions in plasma with and without&#xD;
      aspiration therapy and compare the results to a matched control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to GLP-1 and GIP, several other gut-related hormones are known to regulate&#xD;
      glucose homeostasis and appetite. Glucagon is a peptide hormone secreted from the pancreatic&#xD;
      alpha cells. Glucagon acts opposite to insulin by promoting hepatic gluconeogenesis and&#xD;
      glycogenolysis causing increased plasma glucose concentrations. Oxyntomodulin and pancreatic&#xD;
      peptide YY3-36 (PYY) are peptide hormones secreted by the enteroendocrine L cells in response&#xD;
      to feeding and both suppress appetite. Gastrin is a hormone secreted by G cells localised in&#xD;
      the pyloric antrum, duodenum and pancreas. Gastrin stimulates acid (HCl) secretion and&#xD;
      gastric emptying by increasing gastric motility. Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a peptide hormone&#xD;
      secreted by the enteroendocrine I cells in the duodenum. CCK promotes bile release from the&#xD;
      gallbladder and also acts as an appetite suppressant. To this point, it is unknown how&#xD;
      aspiration therapy affects these appetite- and glucose-regulating hormones during a meal. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to investigate this during standardised mixed meal tests with and without&#xD;
      aspiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, it is relevant to examine the effect of aspiration therapy on satiety. Thus, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to evaluate the effect of aspiration therapy on satiety before, during and&#xD;
      after a mixed meal as well as food intake after the MMT with and without aspiration evaluated&#xD;
      through an ad libitum meal provided at the end of the experimental days.&#xD;
