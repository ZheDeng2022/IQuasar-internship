      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of APX005M in treating younger&#xD;
      patients with primary malignant central nervous system tumor that is growing, spreading, or&#xD;
      getting worse (progressive), or newly diagnosed diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. APX005M can&#xD;
      trigger activation of B cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells and stimulat cytokine release&#xD;
      from lymphocytes and monocytes. APX005M can mediate a direct cytotoxic effect on CD40+ tumor&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter phase I trial of APX005M in patients with recurrent or refractory&#xD;
      primary malignant central nervous system tumor, or newly diagnosed diffuse intrinsic pontine&#xD;
      glioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      APX005M is a humanized IgG1κ mAb that binds to CD40. APX005M binds to both human and&#xD;
      cynomolgus monkey CD40 with high affinity, triggering activation of B cells, monocytes, and&#xD;
      dendritic cells and stimulating cytokine release from both human and monkey lymphocytes and&#xD;
      monocytes. APX005M does not bind to mouse or rat CD40. CD40 is also expressed on many human&#xD;
      tumor cells, and APX005M can mediate a direct cytotoxic effect on CD40+ tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activation of CD40 on tumor cells results in tumor cell apoptosis and inhibition of tumor&#xD;
      growth. CD40 agonistic antibodies have demonstrated potent antitumor immune response&#xD;
      stimulation in both animal models and cancer patients. Due to its action on both immune and&#xD;
      tumor cells, CD40 has been studied as a target for novel cancer immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apexigen has declared the adult recommended phase 2 dose to be 0.3 mg/kg because no dose&#xD;
      limiting toxicities were encountered at that dose and the pharmacodynamic profile was similar&#xD;
      to the 1 mg/kg maximally tolerated dose. This phase 1 clinical trial is to study APX005M in&#xD;
      children with central nervous system tumors.&#xD;
