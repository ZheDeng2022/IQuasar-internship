      The FinnValve investigators planned a nationwide registry to investigate the early and late&#xD;
      outcome of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) compared to surgical aortic valve&#xD;
      replacement (SAVR) in patients with aortic valve stenosis performed from 2008 to 2017 at five&#xD;
      Finnish University Hospitals. Data will be collected in a dedicated electronic case report&#xD;
      form.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale of the study Uncertainty regarding the potential benefits of transcatheter aortic&#xD;
      valve implantation (TAVI) compared to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in patients&#xD;
      with aortic valve stenosis (AS) requires well-designed studies with long-term data on the&#xD;
      outcome of these patients. A Finnish nationwide registry would allow complementing of the&#xD;
      knowledge gained from randomized trials by providing data on the outcome of a more inclusive&#xD;
      patient population, within a Health Care System that reflects the actual clinical practice in&#xD;
      Scandinavia. In fact, the internal validity attained in randomized trials is often achieved&#xD;
      at the expense of uncertainty about generalizability, especially since the populations&#xD;
      enrolled in such studies may differ in significant ways from those seen in practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The choice among different surgical aortic valve prostheses is based on solid data with&#xD;
      20-year follow-up, which have shown significant risk of structural valve deterioration of&#xD;
      bioprosthesis on the second decade after implantation. However, much less is known about the&#xD;
      structural durability of TAVI prostheses beyond 3 years of follow-up. This nationwide&#xD;
      registry would provide data on the durability of surgical bioprostheses as well as second and&#xD;
      third generation TAVI prostheses at 7 years . Continuous follow-up of these patients will&#xD;
      allow monitoring of the durability of these prostheses on the long run.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the introduction of TAVI prompted a rapid development of minimally invasive&#xD;
      surgical techniques and rapid deployment surgical bioprostheses in order to reduce the risk&#xD;
      of early adverse events after SAVR. However, it is unclear whether these advances have a real&#xD;
      clinical benefit on the early and late outcome of patients undergoing SAVR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients operated on for AS at each Finnish University Hospitals from January 2008 to&#xD;
      September 2017 will included in to this registry. The following inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be considered:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients aged &gt;18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary aortic valve procedure with a bioprosthesis for AS with or without associated&#xD;
           regurgitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TAVI and SAVR with or without associated coronary revascularization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TAVI and SAVR for AS after any prior major cardiac surgery with exception of any maze&#xD;
           procedure and/or closure of the left atrial appendage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who underwent any prior SAVR or TAVI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients undergoing concomitant procedures on the mitral valve, tricuspid valve or the&#xD;
           ascending aorta.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients operated on for aortic valve endocarditis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients operated for isolated aortic valve regurgitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition criteria for baseline and operative variables as well as early and late outcomes&#xD;
      will be according to the Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC) 2 guidelines (Kappetein et&#xD;
      al. Eur J Cardiothorac Surg 2012;42:S45-60). Prosthetic valve structural deterioration and&#xD;
      failure will be reported according to the last specific guidelines on this topic (Capodanno&#xD;
      et al. Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 2017;52:408-417). However, because of the lack of complete&#xD;
      echocardiographic follow-up in these patients, valve structural valve deterioration will be&#xD;
      classified only according to the definition criteria of severe hemodynamic structural valve&#xD;
      deterioration of these guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The late events of interest are all-cause mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction,&#xD;
      myocardial revascularization, structural deterioration, non-structural valve dysfunction,&#xD;
      repeated procedures on the aortic valve and implantation of permanent pace-maker. Data on&#xD;
      these late events will be collected at each participating center. These will be further&#xD;
      checked and implemented for patients residing outside the catchment areas by interrogation of&#xD;
      the Finnish National Health Institute for Health and Welfare database as well as Statistics&#xD;
      Finland database.&#xD;
&#xD;
