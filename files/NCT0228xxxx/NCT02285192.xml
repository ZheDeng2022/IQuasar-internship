  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if a radioactive substance called 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose&#xD;
      (18F- FDG), injected into the cervix during a PET/CT scan done before surgery can show us&#xD;
      more clearly which lymph nodes in the pelvis (the area near your uterus and cervix) contain&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

    <description>Accuracy of Positron Lymphography will be defined in terms of sensitivity and will consist of pathology review of labelled, excised specimens compared with lymph node imaging data acquired preoperatively.</description>

    <description>will assess the ability of SUV to predict malignant disease. The continuous variable of SUV assigned to a given lymph node during Positron Lymphography will be compared with the pathologic assessment (benign vs malignant) of each labelled lymph node. The SUV assigned to a given lymph node is done using the the imaging software and not up to the discretion of the radiologist.</description>

    <description>The first 20 eligible patients will be consented to undergo intracervical 18F-FDG injection during a dynamic PET/CT scan. Study enrollment will occur in the clinic during the visit in which they are consented for surgery. Recruited patients will undergo 18F-FDG-guided PET imaging on the day of their scheduled staging surgery. The experimental PET/CT is anticipated to take 2 hours. The second stage of accrual will replace PET/CT with PET/MRI imaging. In every other aspect, patients will receive standard peri- and postoperative care.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The study population will include women with stage IB1 cervical cancer (any histologic&#xD;
             subtype) deemed eligible for surgery, and women with a clinical stage I high-grade&#xD;
             endometrial cancer planning to undergo surgical staging. High grade is defined by the&#xD;
             following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Uterine serous carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Clear cell endometrial carcinoma&#xD;

               -  Grade 3 endometrioid carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Endometrial carcinosarcoma&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Clinical stage I grade 1-2 endometrial cancer also eligible with deep myoinvasion&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  GOG performance status ≤2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Plasma glucose ≤200 mg/dL&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Well-controlled hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical clearance for surgery and considered an appropriate surgical candidate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative serum pregnancy test, if of child-bearing potential&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If, based on surgeon's assessment, the patient is recommended to undergo surgical&#xD;
             staging for histologically confirmed endometrial cancer or if IB1 cervical cancer is&#xD;
             deemed eligible for surgical treatment of disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in other research protocols does not exclude a patient from&#xD;
             participation in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin &lt;10 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Plasma albumin &lt;3 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  GOG performance status &gt;2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Plasma glucose &gt;200 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Renal insufficiency with plasma creatinine &gt;1.6&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient does not meet medical clearance for surgery and is not considered an&#xD;
             appropriate surgical candidate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        For Stage 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient who are unwilling or unable to undergo MRI including patients with&#xD;
             contraindications to MRI such as the presence of cardiac pacemakers of non-compatible&#xD;
             intracranial vascular clips, claustrophobia, inability to lie flat for the duration of&#xD;
             the study etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a metallic hip implant or any other metallic implant or device in the&#xD;
             pelvis that might distort local magnetic field and compromise quality of MRI&#xD;
