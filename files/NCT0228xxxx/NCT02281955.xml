  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn about the effectiveness of using&#xD;
      lower-intensity radiation and chemotherapy to treat human papillomavirus (HPV) associated&#xD;
      low-risk oropharyngeal and/or unknown primary squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck.&#xD;
      The cure rate for this type of cancer is estimated to be high, &gt; 90%. The standard treatment&#xD;
      for this cancer is 7 weeks of radiation with 3 high doses of cisplatin. Sometimes surgery is&#xD;
      performed afterwards. This standard regimen causes a lot of side effects and long term&#xD;
      complications. This study is evaluating whether a lower dose of radiation and chemotherapy&#xD;
      may provide a similar cure rate as the longer, more intensive standard regimen. Patients in&#xD;
      this study will receive 1 less week of radiation and a lower weekly dose of chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a follow-up study to NCT01530997. In NCT01530997, patients with HPV&#xD;
      positive and/or p16 positive low-risk oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) received&#xD;
      de-intensified chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by a limited surgical evaluation. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint of NCT01530997 was the rate of pathological complete response (pCR) after CRT. Power&#xD;
      computations were performed for N=40 and were based on the null hypothesis (H0) that the pCR&#xD;
      for de-intensified chemoradiotherapy is at least 87%, the historical rate. The type 1 error&#xD;
      for this calculation was 14.2%. 43 patients enrolled and 38 were evaluable for the primary&#xD;
      endpoint. The observed pCR rate was 89% (34/38). Since the observed pCR rate was excellent in&#xD;
      NCT01530997 and was in concordance with the expected rate, in the proposed study we will not&#xD;
      mandate a post-CRT surgical evaluation. Instead a PET/CT 10 to 16 weeks post-CRT will be used&#xD;
      to determine whether a surgical evaluation is needed.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will receive Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy Treatments (IMRT), 60 Gy at 2 Gy/fx. The acceptable weekly chemotherapy regimens are Cisplatin 30 to 40 mg/m2 (first choice), Cetuximab 250mg/m2 (second choice), Carboplatin AUC 1.5 and paclitaxel 45 mg/m2 (third choice), Carboplatin AUC 3 (fourth choice). Chemotherapy will be given intravenously weekly during IMRT, 6 total doses. Chemotherapy will not be given to patients with T0-2 N0-1 disease, â‰¤ 10 pack years smoking history. Decision for surgical evaluation will be based on the results of the PET/CT and clinical exam 10-16 weeks after CRT. Patients with a positive PET/CT scan will undergo surgical evaluation at the discretion of the surgeon. Patients with a negative PET/CT scan will be observed.</description>

    <description>All patients will receive Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy Treatments (IMRT). Dose painting IMRT will be used and all doses will be specified to the planning target volume (PTV). The high risk planning target volume (PTV-HR) and standard risk planning target volume (PTV-SR) will be treated to the following respective total doses: 60 Gy and 54 Gy. The dose per fraction to the PTV-HR and PTV-SR will be 2 Gy per day and 1.8 Gy per day respectively. The PTV-HR will include the gross tumor and the PTV-SR will include areas at risk for harboring subclinical microscopic disease.</description>

    <description>Cisplatin is the preferred mandated first choice chemotherapy, however alternative weekly regimens are permissible. Justification for not using cisplatin must be documented. Chemotherapy will be given intravenously weekly during IMRT. 6 total doses will be given. It is preferred that the doses be administered on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36; however, this is not mandatory. Chemotherapy will not be given to patients with T0-2 N0-1 disease, â‰¤ 10 pack years smoking history.</description>

    <description>Decisions for surgical evaluation will be based on the results of the PET/CT 10 to 16 weeks after CRT and clinical exam (including fiberoptic laryngoscopy) at that time. Other optional imaging studies may be performed. Patients with a positive PET/CT scan will undergo surgical evaluation at the discretion of the surgeon, with the goal being to remove any suspected residual tumor with a negative resection margin while maintaining organ preservation. This may include biopsies and/or oncological resections of the primary tumor and lymph node metastases. Patients with a negative PET/CT scan will be observed.</description>

            <description>All patients were treated with Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT). The total dose to the high-risk regions was 60 Gy at 2 Gy per fraction, 30 fractions, 5 days a week, for 6 weeks. Fifty-four gray was delivered to anatomic regions at risk of subclinical disease as indicated. Unilateral radiotherapy was permitted in patients with well-lateralized tonsil primaries. Cisplatin 30 mg/m2 once per week was the mandated first-choice chemotherapy; however, alternative regimens once per week were permissible. Chemotherapy was given intravenously once per week, preferably on Mondays. Six weekly doses were given concurrently with radiation. Dose modifications were allowed as needed per the treating medical oncologist's discretion. If a patient could not tolerate cisplatin for more than 1 week, he or she was switched to an alternative regimen. Chemotherapy was not given to patients with T0-2 N0-1 disease (AJCC 7th edition).</description>
