  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eligible participants with locoregional inoperable recurrence or second primary squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma of the head and neck will be treated with reirradiation combined with anti-PD-1 mAb&#xD;
      MK-3475 (generic name: pembrolizumab, trade name Keytruda®).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each participant will undergo screening and then be treated with reirradiation with 1.2 Gy&#xD;
      BID, 5 days a week (weeks 1-5). MK-3475 (generic name: pembrolizumab, trade name Keytruda®)&#xD;
      will be given at 200mg intravenous every 3 weeks starting day one of reirradiation and will&#xD;
      be continued in all participants until 3 months post completion of reirradiation, at which&#xD;
      time a PET/CT will be done to evaluate response. Participants with progressive disease (PD)&#xD;
      will be taken off MK-3475 and followed for survival. Participants that have a complete&#xD;
      response (CR) will be followed clinically and radiographically, and if disease recurs may be&#xD;
      eligible to be retreated with MK-3475 for up to one year. Participants with partial response&#xD;
      (PR) or stable disease (SD) will continue treatment with MK-3475 for up to two years unless&#xD;
      one of the following occurs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  documented disease progression&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  unacceptable adverse event(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  investigator decision to withdraw the subject&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  withdrawal of consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  noncompliance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  administrative reasons (i.e. trial is closed prematurely).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who have not progressed at completion of 24 months of therapy will be observed,&#xD;
      but may be eligible for 1 year of retreatment with MK-3475 if they develop&#xD;
      recurrence/progression and qualify for retreatment as detailed in the protocol,and if the&#xD;
      trial is still ongoing.&#xD;

    <description>Patient reported outcomes will be measured using EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-H&amp;N35 questionnaires. This tool contains 30 items. It measures 5 functional dimensions (physical, role, cognitive, social, emotional), 6 single items (appetite loss, constipation, dyspnea, financial impact, sleep disturbance, diarrhea), 3 symptom items (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting) and a global health and quality of life scale. Scales range in score from 0 to 100. A high score for a functional scale represents a high/healthy level of functioning whereas a high score for a symptom scale or item represents a high level of symptomatology or problems.</description>
