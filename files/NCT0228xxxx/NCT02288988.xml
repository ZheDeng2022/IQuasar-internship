    <textblock>
      True short esophagus (TSE) is present when the distance between the esophago-gastric (E-G)&#xD;
      junction and the apex of the hiatus is shorter than 2.5 cm, without the application of any&#xD;
      downward pressure on the stomach, after maximal mobilization of the distal thoracic&#xD;
      esophagus. It has been demonstrated that TSE is present in 20% of patients undergoing routine&#xD;
      surgery for gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD), and in more than 50% of cases of type&#xD;
      III-IV hiatal hernia (HH) that are treated surgically. Recent reports have confirmed the&#xD;
      importance of diagnosing and electively treating TSE to reduce the risk of anatomic&#xD;
      recurrence after surgery. The surgical techniques currently used for the elective treatment&#xD;
      of TSE are based on the association of the Collis gastroplasty with an anti-reflux&#xD;
      funduplication and the hiatoplasty, performed using minimally invasive techniques; the&#xD;
      mortality, morbidity, and outcomes of these procedures remain subjects of debate. In light of&#xD;
      the doubtful validity of the surgical results for TSE, some researchers have proposed that&#xD;
      this condition should not be treated with surgical therapy. In the absence of randomized,&#xD;
      multicenter studies designed to compare the surgical techniques used to treat TSE, the&#xD;
      investigators believe that data obtained from a single-center study may be useful to the&#xD;
      surgical community, provided that such data are based on an objective intra-operative&#xD;
      diagnosis of TSE and a rigorous follow-up period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pre-operative evaluation included a clinical interview, a barium swallow study, an upper&#xD;
      gastro-intestinal (GI) endoscopy, and standard manometry. The type and severity of symptoms&#xD;
      and the grade of reflux esophagitis were determined using a questionnaire with&#xD;
      semi-quantitative scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The barium swallow study was performed to define the position of the E-G junction with&#xD;
      respect to the diaphragm with the patient in the upright position, as well as the morphology&#xD;
      and the type of HH. The migration of the E-G junction was radiologically diagnosed in three&#xD;
      steps using the following differential diagnoses: hiatal insufficiency, concentric HH, and&#xD;
      acquired short esophagus. Reflux esophagitis was classified according to the Los Angeles&#xD;
      classification. In the absence of grade A esophagitis or a more severe type of esophagitis,&#xD;
      patients underwent 24-h pH recording or intraluminal impedance/pH monitoring. The need for&#xD;
      surgical therapy was determined according to defined parameters and to the current guidelines&#xD;
      for GERD therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient is placed in the lithotomic position; the pelvis and left chest are lifted 45° to&#xD;
      the right to facilitate access for a left thoracostomy along the posterior axillary line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery begins via five laparoscopic ports: the camera port is placed 5 to 10 cm above the&#xD;
      umbilicus, depending on the patient's body size, to enable access to the upper portion of the&#xD;
      mediastinum. After the opening of the phreno-esophageal membrane, the E-G junction is&#xD;
      isolated and the sac and fat pad (with the exception of the fat near the lesser curvature to&#xD;
      preserve the integrity of the vagus nerves) are resected. A fiber endoscope is inserted&#xD;
      trans-orally to determine the position of the upper margins of the gastric folds, which&#xD;
      correspond to the E-G junction. The tip of the endoscope is placed at this level, which the&#xD;
      surgeon marks with two clips. The intra-thoracic esophagus is mobilized by 9-12 centimeters&#xD;
      to the level at which the left vagus nerve travels along the anterior aspect of the&#xD;
      esophagus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The distance between the E-G junction and the apex of the hiatus is measured after completely&#xD;
      releasing the stomach, using an L-shaped instrument, which prevents errors associated with&#xD;
      the two-dimensional video image. The upper arm of the L (90° based on the axis of the&#xD;
      measurer) is placed at the apex of the diaphragm, and the distance between the base of the&#xD;
      arm and the clip is measured in centimeters; the measurement is positive if the junction is&#xD;
      above and negative if the junction is below the diaphragm. The length of the intra-abdominal&#xD;
      portion of the esophagus that is suitable for the performance of a tension-free&#xD;
      fundoplication is approximately 2.5 cm. If the E-G junction, with the stomach completely&#xD;
      released, is still fixed above or astride the hiatus, the Collis technique is adopted. If the&#xD;
      E-G junction is positioned below the hiatus by only 1-1.5 cm, a scenario in which even the&#xD;
      application of slight downward traction on the stomach makes it possible to obtain the 2-3 cm&#xD;
      of esophagus necessary to perform the fundoplication, its position creates a condition in&#xD;
      which the decision of whether to perform a Collis gastroplasty becomes subjective. In such&#xD;
      cases, the investigators generally perform the lengthening procedure if reflux symptoms have&#xD;
      been present for many years, if the patient is obese, or if the patient is younger than 60&#xD;
      years. To perform the esophagus lengthening procedure, it is necessary to divide at least two&#xD;
      short vessels. By turning the operating table toward the right side of the patient, the&#xD;
      surgeon may simultaneously operate through the aforementioned 5 standard laparoscopic ports,&#xD;
      as well as a left thoracoscopic port through which the instrument used to lengthen the&#xD;
      esophagus is inserted. A thoracostomy is performed at the posterior axillary line at the&#xD;
      V-VI-VII intercostal spaces, depending on the patient's body shape and size. A 12-mm valvular&#xD;
      trocar may be used to prevent loss of pneumoperitoneum and to control intra-thoracic&#xD;
      pressures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anesthesiologist passes a Maloney bougie 46 ch. into the esophagus and into the proximal&#xD;
      stomach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A no. 45 Endo GIA is inserted through the thoracic port; the tip of the instrument is&#xD;
      delicately pressed against the left diaphragm to visually control the progression of the&#xD;
      stapler from the port to the mediastinum. The stapler is fully visible through the hiatus as&#xD;
      it penetrates the left mediastinal pleura. When it enters the abdominal cavity, the jaws are&#xD;
      rotated toward the patient's left side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stapler is opened and positioned at the angle of His with its arms parallel but not too&#xD;
      close to the Maloney bougie. To facilitate this maneuver and prevent the formation of a pouch&#xD;
      between the suture lines and the angle of His, it may be necessary to pull the gastric fundus&#xD;
      to the left when using the stapler.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neo-esophagus is approximately 3 cm long. The mechanical suture line is covered with a&#xD;
      sero- muscular running suture. A hiatoplasty is routinely performed; in the event of a type&#xD;
      II-IV HH, the sutures applied to the diaphragmatic crura are reinforced with&#xD;
      polytetrafluoroethylene-pledgeted sutures (two for each stitch, placed laterally at the edges&#xD;
      of the crura and over the peritoneum). A floppy Nissen fundoplication (one 1.5-cm U stitch&#xD;
      reinforced with pledgets) is performed. The superior edges of the fundoplication are placed&#xD;
      above the clips, which mark the native E-G junction, to fully wrap the neo-esophagus. Two&#xD;
      vertical U stitches intended to grab the inner, circular, muscular layer are applied&#xD;
      laterally between the fundus and the esophagus to prevent slippage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operatively, each of the patients participated in a free-of-charge outpatient follow-up&#xD;
      program that entailed visits at 6 months, 12 months, and 2, 3, 4, and 5 years following&#xD;
      surgery. At 1, 3, and 5 years, patients participated in a clinical interview and underwent&#xD;
      both an upper GI endoscopy and a barium swallow study. The methodologies of these tests were&#xD;
      the same as those used for the pre-operative work-up. Following the initial five-year&#xD;
      follow-up period, patients were offered the opportunity to attend an outpatient clinical&#xD;
      consultation every 3 years, as well as to undergo an endoscopy and a radiological examination&#xD;
      of the esophagus and stomach. The follow-up procedures were established according to the&#xD;
      &quot;good practice criteria&quot; accepted by the Italian Health Service. Patients voluntarily agreed&#xD;
      to participate in the program. The length of the follow-up was calculated based on the amount&#xD;
      of time that elapsed between the date of each patient's surgery and the day on which each&#xD;
      patient appeared for the final follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An evaluation scale for the surgical results, from &quot;excellent&quot; to &quot;poor&quot; was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of cases in which a recurring HH was diagnosed by barium swallow, even an HH&#xD;
      smaller than two centimeters, as well as those of cases in which medical therapy (H2 blockers&#xD;
      or proton pump inhibitors) was necessary to control reflux symptoms or esophagitis, were&#xD;
      classified as &quot;poor&quot;.&#xD;
