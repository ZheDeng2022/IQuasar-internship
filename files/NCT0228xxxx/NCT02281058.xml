  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitiligo is a chronic autoimmune disease with evidence of CTLA-4 involvement. We are&#xD;
      performing a pilot study for the treatment of new onset or actively progressing vitiligo with&#xD;
      abatacept to determine if weekly self-injections of medication lead to clinical improvement&#xD;
      in vitiligo lesions.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Abatacept has been shown to decrease T cell activity and reduce symptoms associated with&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis. Similar pathways have been shown to be involved in vitiligo. Therefore,&#xD;
      we are recruiting 10 adult patients with active vitiligo who meet specific inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria to receive self-administered injections of abatacept weekly starting at&#xD;
      week 0 and continuing until week 24. A 32 week follow-up visit will be performed to evaluate&#xD;
      secondary endpoints as well. We will be monitoring patients to see if skin lesions of&#xD;
      vitiligo stop spreading and start to repigment with continued treatment.&#xD;
