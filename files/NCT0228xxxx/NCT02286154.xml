    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this prospective study of hydroxyurea for children with sickle cell&#xD;
      anemia are 1) Develop and prospectively evaluate a population&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics model to predict the maximum tolerated dose (MTD); 2)&#xD;
      Identify urine biomarkers of hydroxyurea adherence using a novel metabolomics approach; 3)&#xD;
      Identify pharmacogenomics modifiers of hydroxyurea MTD; and 4) Longitudinal monitoring of the&#xD;
      effect of hydroxyurea upon organ function and quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is now ample clinical evidence that hydroxyurea is a safe and effective medication for&#xD;
      adults and children with sickle cell anemia (SCA), and most hematologists agree the&#xD;
      short-term safety and efficacy of hydroxyurea has been proven. The National Heart, Lung, and&#xD;
      Blood Institute have recently released evidence-based guidelines for SCA, recommending that&#xD;
      hydroxyurea be offered to all affected children as young as nine months of age, regardless of&#xD;
      clinical severity. Despite the overwhelming evidence demonstrating safety and efficacy,&#xD;
      hydroxyurea remains underutilized for a variety of reasons. In this prospective study, the&#xD;
      investigators will utilize innovative strategies designed to address and overcome some of the&#xD;
      barriers that currently limit the use of hydroxyurea for children with SCA. The investigators&#xD;
      will utilize novel laboratory techniques and pharmacometric modeling in order to accurately&#xD;
      predict the most effective hydroxyurea dose referred to as the maximum tolerated dose. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to develop a screening urine test to objectively and accurately determine&#xD;
      adherence to hydroxyurea therapy. In addition, the study will document critical laboratory&#xD;
      and clinical characteristics of this unique population of patients with SCA who begin&#xD;
      hydroxyurea at a young age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will follow two groups of patients. The first group, referred to as the New&#xD;
      Cohort, will include mostly young infants who are not receiving hydroxyurea therapy upon&#xD;
      entering the study. The starting dose of hydroxyurea for each of the participants in the New&#xD;
      Cohort will be individually determined using the novel population PK/PD dose-prediction&#xD;
      model. The second group of study participants, referred to as the Old Cohort, will include&#xD;
      patients who are already receiving hydroxyurea therapy upon study entry. Both the Old and New&#xD;
      Cohort (New Cohort) will be included in the development of a urine biomarker of adherence and&#xD;
      will be followed throughout the study to document the effect hydroxyurea has upon organ&#xD;
      function and quality of life. It is important to note that this is not a therapeutic drug&#xD;
      trial. Prior to enrollment in the study, participants, along with their families and clinical&#xD;
      providers, have decided to initiate hydroxyurea therapy for clinical indications. Except for&#xD;
      the dose prediction model for the New Cohort, participants will be treated and monitored&#xD;
      according to the routine clinical practice guidelines of the Cincinnati Children's Hospital&#xD;
      Comprehensive Sickle Cell Center.&#xD;
