    <textblock>
      The objective of this randomized placebo-controlled Phase 2 study is to evaluate prophylactic&#xD;
      effects of dexamethasone for fatigue and malaise (weakness, lethargy, malaise) resulting from&#xD;
      regorafenib treatment, as well as to assess treatment continuation of regorafenib.&#xD;

      1. Patient registration procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
           If it is confirmed that the subject meets the inclusion criteria and correspondent none&#xD;
           of the exclusion criteria, the subject is registered by using Clinical Research Support&#xD;
           Center (CReS) Kyushu registration/allocation system. The registration with the&#xD;
           registration/allocation system is available for 24 hr (URL:&#xD;
           https://reg.cres-kyushu.or.jp/qmin/login/) and needs for individual identifier (ID) and&#xD;
           password.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Quality management&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Preparation and management of the test drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test drugs are an active drug, which is a capsule filled with dexamethasone powder and&#xD;
      lactose, and a placebo, which is a capsule filled with only lactose. The test drugs will be&#xD;
      prepared by the Department of Pharmacy (manager: Professor Masuda), Kyushu University&#xD;
      Hospital in accordance with the procedures for preparation of the test drugs. Dexamethasone&#xD;
      powder and lactose will be purchased by Department of Surgery and Science, Graduate School of&#xD;
      Medical Sciences, Kyushu University from Tomita Pharmaceutical and delivered to the pharmacy&#xD;
      department. Research funds will be used for the purchase. The capsule will be purchased from&#xD;
      Tomita Pharmaceutical. The test drugs will be delivered to CReS-Kyushu (enrollment/data&#xD;
      center) and managed using a double-blind method in accordance with the procedures. The&#xD;
      double-blind code will be kept by the person responsible for management of the test drugs&#xD;
      Shoji Tokunaga, Medical Information Center, Kyushu University, and a backup of the code will&#xD;
      be kept by Hidekazu Aratani of CReS-Kyushu.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test drugs will be managed according to the investigational drug number and stored at the&#xD;
      warehouse of the Fukuoka branch of Yamato Logistics Co., Ltd. The warehouse is certified to&#xD;
      store drugs for humans for more than 2 years under the supervision of pharmacists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the participating medical institution, manager and vice manager for the management of the&#xD;
      test drugs will be appointed. It is preferable that the manager and vice managers are&#xD;
      selected from among personnel who are experienced in drug management including personnel from&#xD;
      the Department of Pharmacy or clinical trial management office. The manager is not allowed to&#xD;
      become the investigator or sub-investigator. A physician who may treat subjects is not&#xD;
      allowed to become the manager.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The electronic data capture (EDC) system will be used for communications between the&#xD;
      enrollment/data center, Yamato Logistics and participating medical institution. Information&#xD;
      on subjects will be reported by e-mail to the data center, and the data center will ensure&#xD;
      the information by telephone to Yamato Logistics and the investigational drug management&#xD;
      division of the medical institution. The test drugs will be delivered by Yamato Logistics to&#xD;
      the medical institution. The test drugs for only a subject will be delivered once (allocation&#xD;
      adjustment factor). Considering that a number of days are necessary for delivery, there&#xD;
      should be at least 3 working days between enrollment and start of treatment. The interval&#xD;
      between enrollment and start of treatments should be up to 14 days. Physicians treating&#xD;
      subjects are not allowed to manage the test drugs. The vice manager will manage the test&#xD;
      drugs according to subjects under the supervision of the manager. Orders for the test drugs&#xD;
      will be made by letter or e-mail in accordance with the medical institution's procedures. A&#xD;
      sufficient number of capsules of the test drugs until the next hospital visit will be&#xD;
      ordered/prescribed once. If the test drugs are used properly in accordance with the protocol,&#xD;
      an order/prescription for the test drugs will be made every 7 days. Subjects (patients) will&#xD;
      be advised to keep records of the use of regorafenib and test drugs in the medication diary.&#xD;
      The remaining number of capsules of the test drugs will be checked in consideration of the&#xD;
      use of the test drugs. The remaining test drugs will be returned to the study office. In&#xD;
      accordance with the protocol, the test drugs should be prescribed for 28-day treatment, but&#xD;
      will be prescribed for 30-day treatment considering loss and damage. The test drug for 2-day&#xD;
      treatment should be left unused when treatment is completed. The remaining test drugs will be&#xD;
      returned to the enrollment/data center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the test drugs are delivered, the enrollment number, investigational drug number,&#xD;
      reception date, the number of capsules of the test drugs delivered will be entered in the EDC&#xD;
      system. Also, the number of capsules prescribed, date of prescription, remaining number of&#xD;
      capsules (total number of capsules stored including the number of capsules returned),&#xD;
      confirmation date of completion/discontinuation of the protocol treatment, total remaining&#xD;
      number of capsules including the number of capsules returned will be entered in the EDC&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of capsules lost and reasons for the loss will be entered in the EDC system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      A central monitoring or in-site monitoring are carried out based on the data from case report&#xD;
      form (CRF) collecting at data coordinating center. In principle, an on-site monitoring is not&#xD;
      carried out, but it may be carried out when the on-site monitoring is determined to need by&#xD;
      Kyushu Study group of Clinical Cancer (KSCC) steering committee from the results of the&#xD;
      central monitoring so on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Monitoring Committee A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) has been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data entry&#xD;
&#xD;
      all data will be entered by the double entry method. Referential data rules, valid values,&#xD;
      range checks, and consistency checks against data already stored in the database will be&#xD;
      supported. Checks will be applied at the time of data entry into a specific field. Additional&#xD;
      errors will be detected by programs designed to detect missing data or specific errors in the&#xD;
      data. The investigator who receives the inquiry will respond by checking the original forms&#xD;
      for inconsistency, checking other sources to determine the correction, modifying the original&#xD;
      paper form entering a response to the query.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regular monitoring report&#xD;
&#xD;
      A regular monitoring report generated by data coordinating center is submitted to KSCC&#xD;
      Steering Committee, principal investigator, the DMC etc and it is reviewed according to &quot;KSCC&#xD;
      regulation on the monitoring&quot;. The information on the status of site ethics committee (EC)&#xD;
      approval and the achievement of enrollment: number of enrollment- total/per periodical,&#xD;
      total/per site, is reported monthly using e-mail.&#xD;

&#xD;
      A site audit is carried out by the audit members of KSCC Coordinating Center, data&#xD;
      coordinating center, medical staff of other site under the approval of the site director&#xD;
      according to &quot;KSCC regulation for site audit&quot;. The results of the audit are reported to the&#xD;
      site director, KSCC Steering Committee, principal investigator etc. (if required, to DMC).&#xD;
