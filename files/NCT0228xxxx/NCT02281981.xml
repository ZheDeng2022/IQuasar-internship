      Arterial Stiffness: As a recognized independent indicator of cardiovascular risk, maintaining&#xD;
      low levels of arterial stiffening is important to cardiovascular health. Increases in&#xD;
      arterial stiffening results in elevated systolic and mean pressure and it is correlated with&#xD;
      various cardiovascular conditions such as left ventricular hypertrophy, ischaemic heart&#xD;
      disease, and myocardial infarction. In contrast, decreased arterial stiffness improves&#xD;
      ventricular-vascular coupling, ejection fraction, and cardiac output. Arterial stiffness is&#xD;
      linked to inflammation and oxidative stress. Both inflammation and oxidative stress are&#xD;
      elevated during DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness), a state brought on by muscle damage&#xD;
      often incurred during strenuous exercise. Recent studies have shown that a single bout of&#xD;
      eccentric exercise can produce acute arterial stiffness during recovery. However,&#xD;
      anti-oxidants/anti-inflammatories may be effective in reducing the extent of damage by&#xD;
      decreasing oxidation and inflammation. Curcumin is a powerful antioxidant that could act as&#xD;
      an anti-inflammatory and diminish the effects of the downhill run. In addition, eccentric&#xD;
      damage generates a prophylactic protection lasting up to six weeks. The nature of the&#xD;
      downhill run is primarily eccentric in nature. Therefore, repeated bouts may have diminished&#xD;
      DOMS development. Any reduction in stress by either the prophylactic repeated bout effect or&#xD;
      the Curcumin supplement, should attenuate the increase in arterial stiffness due to the&#xD;
      reduction in inflammation.&#xD;

      Baseline Participants will report to the lab on day one to have basic anthropometry and&#xD;
      clinical measures performed. Following measures of height, weight, blood pressure, blood&#xD;
      lipids (fasting glucose), creatine kinase, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (HS-CRP) and&#xD;
      interleukin-6 (IL-6) participants will be allowed to eat a small standardized snack.&#xD;
      Participants will then have measures of baseline muscle soreness and leg strength measured&#xD;
      prior to a VO2max test on a cycle ergometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle Soreness will be measured using a standard 10cm analogue scale and girth of the thigh&#xD;
      will be recorded to account for possible alterations owing to local inflammation/oedema./&#xD;
      Creatine Kinase (CK) will be tracked as a measure of damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test termination criteria for the VO2max will include: volitional fatigue, a participant&#xD;
      rating of perceived exertion of 19-20 (on a scale from 0-20), a plateau in O2 uptake with&#xD;
      increasing workload, or and RER of &gt;1.15. The VT of each participant will be noted to compare&#xD;
      with values post- training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing Day 2 - This day will occur at least 1 full day (48h) following VO2max testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will arrive at the lab having consumed a standardized breakfast. Prior to the&#xD;
      downhill run, measures of pulse wave velocity (PWV), heart rate variability (HRV), flow&#xD;
      mediated dilatation (FMD) will be collected according to the protocols to follow.&#xD;
      Participants will then perform a 40 minute downhill run at a grade of -12 percent using a&#xD;
      speed that elicits a VO2 of approximately 60% of the maximum value achieved during the max&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial stiffness will be determined using a Sphygmocor CPVH pulse wave applanation&#xD;
      tonomoter (Atcor Medical). This device measures arterial pulse waves non-invasively through&#xD;
      the skin. By matching pulse wave arrival with heart beats (through a standard ECG tracing)&#xD;
      and measuring the distance between points we can calculate travel time (or velocity). We will&#xD;
      also use this same device to analyze the shape of the pulse wave, which will give us&#xD;
      information about reflected pulse waves (and thus the stiffness of the arterial tree).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: At 24h, 48h, and 72h post exercise, participants will return to the lab to have&#xD;
      all of the non-exercise measures repeated (see figure 1). This will allow temporal tracking&#xD;
      over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) The anti-inflammatory potential of Curcumin supplementation should improve post-exercise&#xD;
      recovery. 2) Repeated bouts of eccentrically biased downhill running should produce a&#xD;
      prophylactic effect and reduce arterial stiffness and recovery time&#xD;
