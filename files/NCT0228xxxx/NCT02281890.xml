      Neonatal sepsis is an important determinant of adverse neurodevelopmental outcome. The&#xD;
      investigators seek to investigate whether neurodevelopmental outcome following neonatal&#xD;
      sepsis differs according to whether or not the diagnosis is confirmed by culture. In a&#xD;
      secondary analysis of all 3493 infants included in the International Neonatal Immunotherapy&#xD;
      Study (INIS) randomized controlled trial of intravenous immunoglobulin for neonatal sepsis,&#xD;
      the investigators will evaluate neurodevelopmental outcomes according to whether or not the&#xD;
      sepsis was culture-proven. The primary outcome is death or major disability at two years. In&#xD;
      secondary analyses the investigators will determine neurodevelopmental outcomes according to&#xD;
      the causative organism identified. Greater understanding of the impact of culture-positivity&#xD;
      on long-term outcomes in the setting of clinical neonatal sepsis is essential to better&#xD;
      inform parents about the future prospects of their child and to guide patient follow-up.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rationale Neonatal sepsis is an important determinant of adverse neurodevelopmental outcome&#xD;
      [Adams-Chapman 2006, Stoll 2004]. A recent meta-analysis estimated that neonatal sepsis more&#xD;
      than doubled the risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcome in very-low-birth-weight (VLBW)&#xD;
      infants (OR 2.09 [95%CI 1.65-2.65]), including cerebral palsy (OR 2.09 [95%CI&#xD;
      1.78-2.45]).[Alshaikh 2013] When a baby with signs suggestive of sepsis, it is common&#xD;
      practice to commence intravenous antibiotic treatment as soon as possible after cultures from&#xD;
      blood and relevant additional sites have been obtained. However, cultures remain negative in&#xD;
      an important subgroup of babies treated for sepsis, despite convincing clinical and/or&#xD;
      laboratory signs of sepsis being present. Although there is some evidence to suggest that&#xD;
      long-term outcomes following neonatal sepsis may differ according to whether or not the&#xD;
      diagnosis was confirmed by culture,[Stoll 2004, Schlapbach 2011] to the best of the&#xD;
      investigators' knowledge a direct comparison between these groups has never been made.&#xD;
      Greater understanding of the impact of culture-positivity on long-term outcomes in the&#xD;
      setting of clinical neonatal sepsis is essential to better inform parents about the future&#xD;
      prospects of their child and to guide patient follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective Investigate differences in neurodevelopmental outcome at two years after neonatal&#xD;
      sepsis according to whether or not the diagnosis was confirmed by culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions Primary Are neurodevelopmental outcomes at two years different between&#xD;
      babies with suspected versus culture-proven sepsis? Secondary Are neurodevelopmental outcomes&#xD;
      at two years different between babies with suspected versus culture-proven sepsis when&#xD;
      considered according to the underlying pathogen?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Secondary cohort analysis of all babies included in the International Neonatal&#xD;
      Immunotherapy Study (INIS) randomized controlled trial (RCT).[INIS Study Collaborative Group&#xD;
      2008]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population The study population consists of all babies included in the INIS trial. The&#xD;
      INIS trial was an RCT of intravenous immunoglobulin (two infusions of 500 mg/kg body weight&#xD;
      polyvalent IgG) versus placebo in the treatment of suspected or proven neonatal sepsis.[INIS&#xD;
      Study Collaborative Group 2008] 3493 infants were included from 113 hospitals in nine&#xD;
      countries.[INIS Collaborative Group 2011] There was no difference between the treatment&#xD;
      groups in the primary outcome of death or major disability at the age of two years (RR 1.00&#xD;
      [95%CI 0.92-1.08]), or in any of the secondary outcomes. Neither was an effect of&#xD;
      immunoglobulin demonstrated in any of the pre-specified subgroup analyses. As the&#xD;
      intervention under study did not have an impact on any of the outcomes, secondary&#xD;
      observational analyses within the dataset are feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure For the primary analyses two groups of babies with neonatal sepsis will be&#xD;
      considered: those with proven sepsis and those with suspected sepsis. Sepsis will be&#xD;
      considered proven when pathogenic organisms (i.e. bacteria or fungi) were cultured from blood&#xD;
      and/or cerebrospinal fluid. All babies with clinical neonatal sepsis in whom cultures&#xD;
      remained negative are considered to have suspected sepsis. In a secondary analysis,&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental outcomes of babies with proven sepsis will be compared to those with&#xD;
      suspected sepsis according to causative organism grouped as follows: coagulase-negative&#xD;
      staphylococci (CONS); other Gram-positive bacteria; Gram-negative bacteria; fungi. Babies&#xD;
      will be classified according to the sepsis episode at the time of inclusion in the INIS&#xD;
      trail. The impact of any additional episodes of sepsis will be investigated in sensitivity&#xD;
      analyses (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes The primary outcome of interest is death or major disability at two years of age.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes (all at two years of age) include: death; disability; and components of&#xD;
      disability: neuromotor disability; disability due to seizures; hearing disability; visual&#xD;
      disability; communicative disability; cognitive disability. All types of disability are&#xD;
      categorised into major/non-major/no disability. The investigators used two questionnaires;&#xD;
      the Health Status Questionnaire (HSQ) was completed by a pediatrician and the Parent&#xD;
      Questionnaire (PQ) was completed by a parent or carer. A third questionnaire, the Short&#xD;
      Health Status Questionnaire (SHSQ), was developed by the Project Management Group in order to&#xD;
      capture the primary outcome for difficult to find children. These questionnaires were sent to&#xD;
      general practitioners or health visitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The disability classification for each domain (with the exception of the cognitive domain)&#xD;
      was calculated from the answers to questions on the HSQ or the PQ [see INIS Collaborative&#xD;
      Group 2011 (online supplement) for more detail]. If one questionnaire was missing, the&#xD;
      calculation used only the answer on the other questionnaire. If the domain classification was&#xD;
      unknown and a SHSQ had been received, the classification from that questionnaire was used for&#xD;
      that domain only. Cognitive function was assessed in INIS by parents using the revised Parent&#xD;
      Report of Children's Abilities questionnaire (PARCA-R1 [Saudino 1998]), as described&#xD;
      previously [INIS Collaborative Group 2011 (online supplement)].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses The following characteristics will be compared between babies with proven and&#xD;
      suspected sepsis in tabular form: baseline characteristics, clinical characteristics at&#xD;
      presentation with sepsis, neonatal outcome at discharge; outcome at two years. Primary and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes at two years will be compared between the two groups in univariable&#xD;
      analyses using Chi square test. Multivariable adjustment for potential confounders around&#xD;
      birth and at presentation with sepsis (including country and INIS study drug) will be&#xD;
      performed using separate logistic regression models for each outcome. The logistic regression&#xD;
      models will be considered the primary analyses. Separate models will be constructed for major&#xD;
      disability and for any disability (major+non-major).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroup analyses Two sets of subgroup analyses will be undertaken. First, given the&#xD;
      difference in aetiology between early onset (&lt;72 hours after birth) sepsis and late onset&#xD;
      (&gt;=72 hours after birth) sepsis, the data will be re-analysed according to whether the sepsis&#xD;
      episode was early or late onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, as gestational age is a key determinant of adverse neurodevelopmental outcome, the&#xD;
      investigators will undertake a subgroup analysis to investigate the impact of proven versus&#xD;
      suspected sepsis on neurodevelopmental outcomes according to whether gestational age at birth&#xD;
      was &lt; or ≥ 30 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity analyses Missing values are present for a number of covariates to be included in&#xD;
      the multivariable adjustment. By default, logistic regression analysis will be based on&#xD;
      babies with complete data only on all variables in the model. The investigators will thus&#xD;
      undertake a sensitivity analysis after multiple imputation of missing data on all covariates&#xD;
      included in the primary model, creating and analysing five unique datasets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the primary analysis of this study, only the neonatal sepsis episode at presentation&#xD;
      (i.e. at inclusion in the INIS trial) will be considered to classify babies as having&#xD;
      suspected or proven sepsis. An important subgroup of babies however, experienced one or more&#xD;
      additional episodes of sepsis following inclusion in the study, which may affect the findings&#xD;
      depending on whether or not these were culture-proven. The investigators will therefore&#xD;
      undertake two additional sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of subsequent episodes of&#xD;
      sepsis on the difference in neurodevelopmental outcome according to whether or not proven&#xD;
      sepsis was present. In a first sensitivity analysis the investigators will exclude from the&#xD;
      cohort all babies in whom additional episodes of neonatal sepsis were present following the&#xD;
      initial presentation with sepsis. This will facilitate a fair comparison of babies with&#xD;
      single episodes of proven versus suspected sepsis. In a second sensitivity analysis of the&#xD;
      full cohort, the investigators will re-classify as proven sepsis all babies labeled as&#xD;
      suspected sepsis based on the initial presentation, in whom subsequent episodes of proven&#xD;
      sepsis were present. The investigators will then compare neurodevelopmental outcomes&#xD;
      according to whether or not proven sepsis was present at any time point during initial&#xD;
      hospital admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size The sample size of the cohort is based on the original RCT design.[INIS Study&#xD;
      Collaborative Group 2008, INIS Collaborative Group 2011] For the purpose of this secondary&#xD;
      analysis the cohort may thus be considered a convenience sample. To the best of the&#xD;
      investigators' knowledge this cohort is the second largest to evaluate neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      outcomes following neonatal sepsis.[Alshaikh 2013] In multivariate analyses of 6093&#xD;
      extremely-low-birth-weight (ELBW) infants from the National Institute of Child Health and&#xD;
      Human Development (NICHD) cohort followed up at two years of age, Stoll and colleagues were&#xD;
      able to demonstrate clinically relevant differences (OR ≥1.3) in key neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      outcomes between uninfected babies and different categories of babies with neonatal sepsis&#xD;
      with statistical significance.[Stoll 2004] The same accounted for their subgroup analyses&#xD;
      according to causative organism.[Stoll 2004] In much smaller studies, others have also&#xD;
      demonstrated statistically significant impact of neonatal sepsis on neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      outcome, as reviewed elsewhere.[Alshaikh 2013] The investigators therefore expect the INIS&#xD;
      cohort to have sufficient power to detect clinically relevant differences (OR ≥1.3) in&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental outcomes between VLBW infants with suspected versus proven neonatal&#xD;
      sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations The original RCT was approved by the national and local ethical&#xD;
      committees of each participating hospital. Anonymised data were used for the purpose of this&#xD;
      secondary analysis. According to UK and Dutch regulations, no formal ethical assessment is&#xD;
      required for secondary analyses of anonymised data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination Findings will be reported in a manuscript to be submitted for publication with&#xD;
      a leading medical journal in an appropriate field (i.e. paediatrics, infection/immunology,&#xD;
      neurology), and may be presented at international clinical and research meetings.&#xD;
