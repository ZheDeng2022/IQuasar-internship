  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical evidence about the effects of cannabis in a perioperative setting or for the&#xD;
      management of acute pain is rather scarce, mostly consisting of case report-based opinions on&#xD;
      adverse events during or after general anesthesia after smoking cannabis, experimental pain&#xD;
      trials in healthy volunteers, and a few clinical trials using different drugs, dosages and&#xD;
      routes of administration. It is difficult to draw strong conclusions from the available&#xD;
      evidence, that may seem sometimes even contradictory, mainly due -the investigators believe-&#xD;
      to the many sources of variability in the study designs (e.g.: heterogeneity of the study&#xD;
      samples, underpowered, unblinding, lack of randomization, timing of the therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention, different experimental pain models, inclusion of different kind of surgical&#xD;
      pain, etc.). Nevertheless, expert's opinion after a critical review of the literature is that&#xD;
      cannabis and cannabinoids may have a beneficial role in the management of acute&#xD;
      post-operative pain and nausea, at least for a selected group of patients and through an&#xD;
      appropriate therapeutic intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it seems to us pertinent to carry out an investigation in order to re-evaluate the&#xD;
      issue of perioperative cannabis use through a sufficiently powered and controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial. Some of cannabis effects such as sedation, bronchodilation, dryness of respiratory&#xD;
      secretions, vein dilation, and increase of heart rater without producing hypertension, make&#xD;
      of it an attractive option for pre-medication; while its antiemetic properties and its&#xD;
      analgesic potential without causing respiratory depression may be profitable for the&#xD;
      post-operative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cannabis oil seem to be most suitable to our investigation. The co-administration of&#xD;
      tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) with cannabidiol (CBD) may translate into additional therapeutic&#xD;
      benefits with an attenuation of adverse effects. The investigators expect to obtain less&#xD;
      sedation, milder &quot;high&quot;, lower incidence of anxiety, tachycardia, and hyperalgesia, as&#xD;
      compared with THC-only acute pain trials.&#xD;

      The selection of patients will be done during the pre-anesthetic assessment the day before&#xD;
      surgery. After obtaining informed consent, eligible patients will be randomly allocated to&#xD;
      one of the following regimes: Cannabis oil high dose (21.6 mg THC + 20 mg CBD), Cannabis oil&#xD;
      low dose (10.8 mg THC + 10 mg CBD), placebo control (no premedication drugs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments will be administered in a double-dummy manner. Identical bottles of Cannabis oil&#xD;
      and placebo should be obtained from the manufacturer (Bazelet group). Identical prefilled&#xD;
      vials containing sodium Olive oil should be prepared by the hospital pharmacist. To the best&#xD;
      of our knowledge, no clinical studies evaluating the effects of Cannabis oil on acute pain or&#xD;
      in a perioperative setting have been done to date. Therefore, the investigators estimate a&#xD;
      Cannabis oil dose range that seems reasonable to obtain relevant clinical and a manageable&#xD;
      occurrence of adverse events, mainly based on the recommendations from the manufacturer, on&#xD;
      the available pharmacological data presented in the previous section and on the results of&#xD;
      other clinical trials with a similar design using comparable doses of oral THC. Nevertheless,&#xD;
      the first 10 patients will be randomly assigned either to the Cannabis oil low dose group or&#xD;
      to the placebo control group only. The investigators will proceed with the full four-group&#xD;
      randomization only if no serious adverse events are registered among the 10 first recruited&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the arrival to the operating room, blood samples for baseline levels of cannabinoids will&#xD;
      be drawn at the moment of placing the intravenous line, and the first anxiety assessment&#xD;
      should be done by the examiner/anesthetist. The study drugs will be administered at the&#xD;
      entrance to the O.R. or at the induction room 15 minutes before the induction of anesthesia&#xD;
      (i.e.:). Premedication dose should be calculated to be the equivalent of 10 mg and 20 mg oral&#xD;
      THC for the low and high dose groups, respectively (4, 8 puffs). At the same time, the&#xD;
      prefilled drops containing Olive oil will be administered as intravenous bolus. The patients&#xD;
      will be immediately connected to the standard O.R. monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction of general anaesthesia will be done in a standardized fashion with fentanyl 2&#xD;
      µg/Kg, propofol 1-4 mg/Kg (and vecuronium 0.1 mg/Kg if intubation is required). For&#xD;
      anaesthetic maintenance, isoflurane 0.7-2% on 1:2 oxygen : nitrous oxide gas mixture, and&#xD;
      fentanyl boluses 1 µg/Kg to keep a bispectral index (BIS) between 40 to 60, and a heart rate&#xD;
      and mean arterial pressure between 70-130% from pre-induction baselines. Preemptive&#xD;
      antiemetics (e.g.: granisetron, ondansetron, metoclopramide, dexamethasone, etc.) should not&#xD;
      be given. No additional analgesics should be administered (e.g.: ketorolac or other NSAID's,&#xD;
      dipyrone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A loading dose of morphine 0.2 mg/Kg will be given before the end of surgery provided that&#xD;
      the patient can maintain spontaneous breathing or pressure support ventilation. Intravenous&#xD;
      morphine patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) will be initiated on the arrival to the recovery&#xD;
      room with boluses of 1 mg and a lockout time of 6 minutes, without background.&#xD;
