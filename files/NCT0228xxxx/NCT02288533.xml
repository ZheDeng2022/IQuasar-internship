    <textblock>
      Consciousness disorders have high impact on society and national health system. One of these&#xD;
      disorders is vegetative condition in which, as in coma, there isn't any self or environmental&#xD;
      consciousness but there is alertness, whereas in minimal state of consciousness at least part&#xD;
      of awareness is conserved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Emilia Romagna region about 80 people per million of inhabitants are hospitalized after&#xD;
      cerebral damage, and after discharge about 1/5 of patients are stabilized in a consciousness&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of these disorders is based on neurobehavioural tests, for example JFK Coma&#xD;
      Recovery Scale Revised (CRS-R).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In these patients recovery of state of consciousness is one of the main challenges. There are&#xD;
      very little evidences about treatment, it has been proposed the use of therapies that could&#xD;
      modulate central nervous system activity, like specific drugs, neuroimaging and&#xD;
      neuromodulation techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and repetitive&#xD;
      transcranial current stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A non invasive neuromodulation technique is transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)&#xD;
      which can modulate cortical excitability: cathodic current reduces excitability whereas&#xD;
      anodic current increases it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, tDCS is an easy technique to use, it's not invasive and it's an efficient tool&#xD;
      for the modulation of cortical excitability that demonstrated reliable results in healthy&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the tDCS can modulate cortical excitability it is likely that the combination of this&#xD;
      stimulation tool with transcranial magnetic stimulation for the registration of cortical&#xD;
      excitability could give important information about cerebral damage in patients with&#xD;
      consciousness disorders and to test new treatments. It is also likely that the modification&#xD;
      of cortical excitability could induce neurobehavioural changes.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will receive tDCS over the primary motor cortex bilaterally (M1). The excitability-enhancing anode electrode (saline-soaked sponge electrode - 16cm2) will be placed over the primary motor cortex, C3 and C4 (10/20 international EEG system). The excitability-diminishing cathode electrode will be placed over the supraorbital area. We will use the following stimulation parameters: intensity of 2 milliampere and for 40 minutes (10 consecutive sessions).</description>
