  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a research study on nutrition in mitochondrial disease. The&#xD;
      investigators are interested in the kind of carbohydrates that people eat. Carbohydrates are&#xD;
      an important source of energy. Certain kinds of carbohydrates tend to raise blood sugar more&#xD;
      in healthy people, and others tend to raise blood sugar less in healthy people. The&#xD;
      investigators would like to know if by eating the &quot;right&quot; type of carbohydrate, people with&#xD;
      mitochondrial disease can avoid high lactate levels, high blood sugar levels, and, later, low&#xD;
      blood sugars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, this question will be answered by finding out how people with mitochondrial&#xD;
      disease respond to two different test meals containing different kinds of carbohydrates.&#xD;
      Neither participants nor the investigators will know which kind of test meal participants are&#xD;
      eating.&#xD;

      This research study involves two study visits at CHOP, each around 6 to 8 hours long. The&#xD;
      time the visit takes can depend on how long it takes to complete the study procedures listed.&#xD;
      This can be different from person to person. The length of time between Visit #1 and Visit #2&#xD;
      will be between 2 weeks and 3 months. Overall study participation will not exceed 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves the following tests and procedures. These happen at each of the two&#xD;
      visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interviews: A team member will take the participant's medical history, along with a&#xD;
           listing of any medications s/he is taking. Throughout the study the participant will be&#xD;
           asked to report if s/he thinks that anything bad has happened as a result of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3-day diet record: The investigator will collect the record the participant made of&#xD;
           everything s/he ate for the 3 days before the study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical Examination: The investigators will measure the participant's weight, height,&#xD;
           blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate, and waist circumference. If the&#xD;
           participant is under age 21 years, a pediatric endocrinologist will check how far s/he&#xD;
           is along in puberty. For both boys and girls, pubic hair growth will be checked. For&#xD;
           girls, breast development will be checked. For boys, testicular development will be&#xD;
           checked. This examination will take approximately 2 minutes and will be done in a&#xD;
           private room.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy Test (female subjects): If a female participant is eleven years old or older&#xD;
           and/or has already started having periods, she will be asked to take a pregnancy test&#xD;
           before starting this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires: Investigators will ask the participant to fill out questionnaires on&#xD;
           his/her physical function and well-being. These are designed for people with&#xD;
           mitochondrial disease (or for parents of children with mitochondrial disease). They&#xD;
           should take around 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-Test Fast: The participant will not be able to eat or drink anything except plain,&#xD;
           unflavored water (i.e., you will &quot;fast&quot;) for at least 4 hours before the mixed-meal&#xD;
           tolerance test starts. S/he will get the test meal at that time. S/he will receive a&#xD;
           recommendation when the visit is scheduled when to begin fasting. This recommendation is&#xD;
           designed for no more than 10 hours of fasting, or the participant's longest usual&#xD;
           overnight fast, whichever is shorter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mixed Meal Tolerance Test (MMTT): The test includes placement of an intravenous (IV)&#xD;
           line in the participant's arm/hand to make taking the blood samples easier. With the IV&#xD;
           in place, the participant will not need to be stuck again for any further blood draws,&#xD;
           unless the IV stops working. If s/he prefers, a numbing cream can be placed on your skin&#xD;
           for about 45 minutes before this test to numb the area. Once the IV is in place, the&#xD;
           participant will receive a test &quot;shake&quot;. S/he will have about 30 minutes to finish the&#xD;
           shake. Over the next 4 hours, blood will be drawn every 30 minutes from the IV line. The&#xD;
           total amount of blood drawn for the MMTT will be a little less than 2 tablespoons.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cognitive Testing: Two times during the MMTT participants will be asked to perform some&#xD;
           testing on a computer (for example, pressing a button as soon as you see a symbol&#xD;
           appear). Each test will take around 14 minutes and tests things like attention and&#xD;
           reaction time. We will show you how these tests work before the MMTT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) Scan: A special x-ray of the body called a DXA&#xD;
           scan will be done to measure the amount of fat and lean (non-fat) tissue in the&#xD;
           participant's body. During the DXA scan, the participant will be asked to lie flat on&#xD;
           your back on a table as the scanning machine moves above the participant's body. The DXA&#xD;
           scan is like an X-ray, and takes about 5-10 minutes. This test is painless and does not&#xD;
           involve any needles.&#xD;
