  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Benzodiazepines (BZD) are widely used to treat anxiety, insomnia, and depression. These drugs&#xD;
      can have very serious side effects if they are taken over a long period of time. In addition&#xD;
      to stability, memory, concentration, vigilance, and attention impairments, long-term use of&#xD;
      BZD is also associated with an increased in hypertension incidence, urinary incontinence,&#xD;
      coronary artery disease, and renal complications. There are growing evidences that long-term&#xD;
      BZD use causes physical and psychological dependence as evidenced by the withdrawal syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recommended strategy by physicians to facilitate the withdrawal of BZD is to gradually&#xD;
      reduce the medication, either by replacing the BZD by another with a longer half-life, or by&#xD;
      the gradual dose reduction. Unfortunately, the success of such a procedure is low as up to&#xD;
      80% of people who try to quit, relapse due to the intolerance of withdrawal symptoms.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is important to find new strategies to overcome the withdrawal difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to test the effectiveness of a novel psychosocial intervention&#xD;
      called PASSE-65+ to facilitate the benzodiazepine withdrawal in the older users, thus&#xD;
      providing a new therapeutic tool to physician.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Benzodiazepines (BZD) represent the most frequently consumed drugs by the elderly persons in&#xD;
      Canada. Indeed, there is 7.5 times more BZD users in older people (65 years and over) than in&#xD;
      adults (18-64 years). Importantly, more than 50% of seniors who received a prescription of&#xD;
      BZD do not display any severe psychiatric symptoms and are physically in good health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from a survey including 2811 community-dwelling older adults (65 years and over)&#xD;
      showed that 32% of the respondents consumed BZD for an average of 205 days and 60% of them&#xD;
      had at least received one potentially inappropriate prescription during this period (e.g. a&#xD;
      prescription of a BZD with a long half-life or a prescription of 2 BZD for more than 6&#xD;
      consecutive weeks, etc.). Another study showed that 45% of new BZD users take these drugs for&#xD;
      more than 30 days. It should be noted that the definition of a long-term BZD use varies from&#xD;
      three to four months of consumption, which corresponds to the average period used by almost&#xD;
      all seniors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term use of BZD by older people is a complex phenomenon that can be explained by several&#xD;
      personal, psychological, and social factors interacting with each other. Systemic model of&#xD;
      BZD consumption in late-life implies the following five elements which contribute to initiate&#xD;
      and maintain BZD taking: 1) history (i.e. autonomy loss, stress, disease apparition, etc.);&#xD;
      2) the prescription process; 3) personal dispositions (i.e. sexe, age, education, loneliness,&#xD;
      etc.); 4) sociocultural factors (i.e. positive attitude of their family or their physician&#xD;
      toward BZD use); and 5) cognitive strategies (e.g. trivialization of concerns about the&#xD;
      drugs, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the researcher's knowledge, very few randomized controlled clinical trials have tested the&#xD;
      effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions in patients with a mean age of 60 years&#xD;
      and older. Data from these studies showed that brief intervention (e.g. receiving either an&#xD;
      informative leaflet on BZD withdrawal during a meeting with the doctor or an informative&#xD;
      letter by post mail) or psychological interventions (including cognitive behavioral therapy&#xD;
      or CBT) are most likely more effective than the standard care and in some cases, to the&#xD;
      gradual dose reduction (GDR) supervised by a physician. However, only 10% (brief&#xD;
      intervention) to 85% (cognitive behavioral therapy designed to treat insomnia) of&#xD;
      participants completely stopped BZD use at the end of treatment. Furthermore, Parr and&#xD;
      colleagues indicate that the complete stop of BZD consumption remains difficult and still a&#xD;
      big challenge to patients, clinicians and researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, one of the limitations of these studies is the large variation of age of their&#xD;
      participants (ranging from 18 to 85 years, despite a mean age of over 60 years), thus&#xD;
      restricting the generalization of the findings to older patients. Moreover, these results&#xD;
      derive from efficacy studies (vs effectiveness studies) designed to improve internal validity&#xD;
      at the expense of external validity. Although these results demonstrate the potential&#xD;
      efficacy (vs effectiveness) of non-pharmacological treatments to facilitate BZD withdrawal,&#xD;
      very few elderly users receive such interventions due to lack of resources, expertise and&#xD;
      time or simply due to their expensive implementation cost. Finally, to the investigator's&#xD;
      knowledge, no psychosocial intervention based on cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and&#xD;
      including other specific personal, psychological, and social components associated to aging,&#xD;
      and targeting older people with different psychological problems (i.e. not only insomnia but&#xD;
      also anxiety or depression) has been tested. Therefore, the researcher hypothesized that the&#xD;
      &quot;Programme d'Aide au Succès du SEvrage (PASSE-65+)&quot; could be more suitable and effective to&#xD;
      help older people in their BZD withdrawal management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to answer the investigator's hypothesis, long-term older users of BZD will first&#xD;
      receive a clinical assessment to determine whether they meet the research criteria. The&#xD;
      participants (n=75) will then be randomly allocated to one of the following three groups: one&#xD;
      group will receive an informative document (describing the steps for a gradual self-weaning),&#xD;
      a second will receive the same informative document and will have a 30 minutes meeting with a&#xD;
      physician once a week, and the third group will receive the informative document, will meet a&#xD;
      physician once a week and will receive a psychosocial intervention (PASSE-65+).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is noteworthy that the psychosocial intervention will also be offered to the first 2&#xD;
      groups at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study will be conducted during a 12 week-period for the first 2 groups. For the&#xD;
      third group, the intervention will be offered on 12 sessions during a 16 week-period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All groups will undergo three additional assessments (2 to 14 days, 3 months and 12 months)&#xD;
      following end of interventions. These last assessments aim to measure the rate of relapse,&#xD;
      withdrawal symptoms, intensity of anxious and depressive symptoms, and the sleep quality of&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, 15 participants will be randomly chosen and divided into 3 groups (n=5): One group&#xD;
      will be constituted by BZD users who completely stopped taking their drug, the second one&#xD;
      with BZD users who diminished their consumption and the third one with participants who&#xD;
      relapsed or dropped out. All participants from these groups will be interviewed at home to&#xD;
      collect their opinion about the PASSE-65+ program.&#xD;
