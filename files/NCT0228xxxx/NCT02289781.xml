    <textblock>
      A randomized, controlled clinical trial is designed to analyze the wear of enamel by opposing&#xD;
      polished monolithic zirconia crowns and by the polished veneer surfaces of metal-ceramic&#xD;
      crowns. This single-blind pilot study will involve a total of 30 teeth that require full&#xD;
      coverage crowns that oppose natural antagonist teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this research are to test the following hypotheses: (1) differences between&#xD;
      mean wear of antagonist enamel by polished monolithic zirconia crowns and by the polished&#xD;
      veneer surface of metal-ceramic crowns are statistically significant; (2) differences between&#xD;
      mean wear of antagonist enamel by opposing polished monolithic zirconia crowns and enamel by&#xD;
      opposing enamel are statistically significant; and (3) differences between mean antagonist&#xD;
      wear of enamel by opposing polished veneer surfaces of metal-ceramic crowns and enamel by&#xD;
      opposing enamel are statistically significant.&#xD;

      To participate in this study a crown will need to be place on one of the back teeth. This&#xD;
      generally occurs when the back tooth has a big filling and there is a risk for fracture of&#xD;
      the tooth or a root canal has been performed on the tooth. An initial x-ray of the tooth and&#xD;
      the surrounding teeth will be done to make sure that there is enough bone supporting the&#xD;
      tooth that will be crowned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A receive local anesthesia will be used in the area where the crown will be made. The tooth&#xD;
      area may need to be build-up with a filling material if there is not enough tooth structure&#xD;
      remaining. Once this happens, then a high-speed drill will be used to a grind down of the&#xD;
      tooth material using to a make smaller size of the original tooth. A small thread will be&#xD;
      used to make space between the gums and tooth so an accurate replica of the tooth can be&#xD;
      made. A temporary crown will be made to go over the prepared tooth and will cement until the&#xD;
      final crown is ready to be cemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The extra procedures will be done to measure bite force to see how much force is exerted with&#xD;
      the teeth. Other extra procedures include the six month and yearly impressions as well as&#xD;
      scanning of your teeth to aid in the measurement of wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned (much like the flip of a coin) to receive either a&#xD;
      crown that has metal in it or a crown that is all-ceramic. Both of these materials are&#xD;
      considered standard of care in dental practice.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be over 21 years of age and in good overall health. No contraindications&#xD;
             to dental treatment are present&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be in good overall good dental health and are at a low caries risk, with&#xD;
             no active tooth decay (caries), and no periodontal disease. Periodontal pocket depths&#xD;
             on all remaining teeth are not greater than 4 mm&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have no existing temporomandibular disorder, (e.g. clicking, popping,&#xD;
             pain on opening) or parafunctional habits (e.g. bruxism, clenching)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must need a crown on either a first or second premolar or first or second&#xD;
             molar in any arch. Abutment teeth must be restorable and have a crown:root ratio of at&#xD;
             least 1:1. Abutment teeth must have a full complement of opposing non-restored or&#xD;
             minimally restored natural teeth. Minimally restored means the teeth contain no&#xD;
             restoration greater than a Class II amalgam restoration. The opposing arch must not&#xD;
             have a full coverage restoration or a partial denture. The contralateral tooth and its&#xD;
             antagonist are present&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must exhibit good oral hygiene and compliance with oral hygiene instructions&#xD;
             as determined by the amount of plaque present on tooth surfaces&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must exhibit a normal flow of saliva. Subjects with any medical pathologies&#xD;
             that limit salivary flow volume or who require a chronic intake of medications that&#xD;
             minimize flow of saliva will be excluded from the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be willing to pay $500 for the clinic incidentals and they must be&#xD;
