      This is a non-randomized, open-label, single-dose study to compare the PK of 21 desacetyl-DFZ&#xD;
      and, if data permits, deflazacort in 8 subjects with ESRD to that of 8 healthy matched&#xD;
      control subjects (age, body mass index [BMI], and gender).&#xD;

      This is a non-randomized, open-label, single-dose study to compare the PK of 21 desacetyl-DFZ&#xD;
      and, if data permits, deflazacort in 8 subjects with ESRD to that of 8 healthy matched&#xD;
      control subjects (age, body mass index [BMI], and gender).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects with ESRD will be on hemodialysis (HD). Dosing of deflazacort followed by PK&#xD;
      evaluation of 21 desacetyl DFZ and, if data permits, deflazacort, will only be performed on a&#xD;
      non-HD day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1, that will be scheduled on a non-HD day for subjects with ESRD, a single oral dose&#xD;
      of deflazacort will be administered followed by serial blood sampling for 24 hours to assess&#xD;
      the PK of 21 desacetyl-DFZ, and, if data permits, deflazacort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be monitored throughout the study by repeated clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will return to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) 3 days (± 1 day) following study&#xD;
      drug administration to determine if any adverse events (AEs) have occurred since the last&#xD;
      study visit. Subjects who terminate the study early will be contacted if the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator (PI) deems necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of sixteen (16) adult male and female subjects will be enrolled. Renal Impaired&#xD;
      Cohort: Eight (8) subjects with ESRD on HD. Healthy Match Control Cohort: Eight (8) healthy&#xD;
      subjects with estimated creatinine clearance (CLcr) ≥ 90 mL/min. Subjects will be matched for&#xD;
      age [± 15 years], BMI [± 15 %], and gender [1:1] to the subjects in the ESRD cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will receive a single oral dose of 18 mg (3 X 6 mg tablets) deflazacort,&#xD;
      following an overnight fast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drug will be administered orally with approximately 240 mL of water.&#xD;

    <description>Deflazacort, a glucocorticoid with anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects, is used in treating a variety of diseases. Pharmacologically it is an inactive pro-drug which is metabolized immediately to the active metabolite 21-desacetyl-DFZ. The elimination of this metabolite is primarily via the urine in humans. Its potency is approximately 70 to 90% of prednisone and 6 mg of deflazacort has approximately the same anti-inflammatory potency as 5 mg of prednisolone or prednisone</description>
