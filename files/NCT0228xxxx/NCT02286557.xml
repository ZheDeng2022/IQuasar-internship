  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 95% of individuals with Multiple Sclerosis report experiencing cognitive fatigue,&#xD;
      characterized by a lack of energy, feelings of exhaustion, an the perception that one is&#xD;
      unable to partake in daily activities. The goal of this project is to test whether&#xD;
      methylphenidate (MP), a well-known psychostimulant, can effective treat fatigue experienced&#xD;
      by individuals with MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will test the effect of MP on MS fatigue through a clinical trial. Every&#xD;
      participant in the study will be exposed to both the drug and the placebo for a period of&#xD;
      time. Both the investigators and participants will be unaware whether participants are&#xD;
      receiving the drug or the placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon successful completion of the study, physicians will be able to evaluate the potential&#xD;
      prescription of MP to treat fatigue in persons with MS based on solid research evidence.&#xD;
      Importantly, MP is already an FDA approved widely used medication in multiple clinical&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;

      As highlighted by the National Clinical Advisory Board of the National Multiple Sclerosis&#xD;
      Society (NMSS), &quot;fatigue is the most common MS (multiple sclerosis) symptom&quot;, affecting up to&#xD;
      95% of individuals. Higher levels of cognitive fatigue have been associated with poorer&#xD;
      quality of life (Amato &amp; Portaccio, 2012) and increased disability (Lapierre &amp; Hum, 2007),&#xD;
      negatively affecting wellness. Several medications are currently prescribed to individuals&#xD;
      with MS who suffer from fatigue, such as amantadine and modafinil. However, the effect of&#xD;
      these medications on decreasing fatigue levels in individuals with MS is suboptimal (e.g.&#xD;
      Stankoff et al., 2005). At the same time, there is overwhelming evidence showing that&#xD;
      methylphenidate is effective at relieving fatigue in individuals with cancer (Minton et al.,&#xD;
      2013), human immunodeficiency virus (Breitbart, Rosenfeld, Kaim, &amp; Funesti-Esch, 2001),&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease (Devos et al., 2013) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) (Blockmans et&#xD;
      al., 2006). For example, individuals with CFS reported decreased fatigue levels (as measured&#xD;
      with a visual analogue scale) when taking MP (Blockmans et al., 2006). Although MP has been&#xD;
      demonstrated to be an effective fatigue-relieving drug in multiple clinical populations&#xD;
      discussed above, the effect of MP on MS-related fatigue has not been objectively tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MP is a psychostimulant that acts by inhibiting presynaptic dopamine transporters leading to&#xD;
      suppression of dopamine reuptake (Prommer, 2012). That is, due to reuptake suppression, more&#xD;
      dopamine remains in the synapses. MP primarily affects the striatum (which receives dopamine&#xD;
      neuron projections from the substantia nigra pars compacta) and subsequently the prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex (PFC), which receives dopaminergic projections from the striatum (Volkow et al.,&#xD;
      2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, the only randomized clinical trial using MP in persons with MS assessed the&#xD;
      effect of this medication on attention, reporting significant improvements in cognitive task&#xD;
      performance (PASAT) in the MP treatment group (Harel, Appleboim, Lavie, &amp; Achiron, 2009) as&#xD;
      compared to a placebo control group. While an expert opinion paper sponsored by the NMSS&#xD;
      recommends the use of MP to treat fatigue (Expert Opinion Paper, 2006), to our knowledge, no&#xD;
      clinical trials have been conduced to objectively test the effect of MP administration on&#xD;
      fatigue in individuals with MS and support this recommendation. The current study will fill&#xD;
      this void in the literature. Aim 1: We propose to test the efficacy of MP on decreasing&#xD;
      self-reported fatigue in individuals with MS in a double blind placebo controlled randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial (DBRCT). Aim 2: We will also examine the effects of MP on cognitive&#xD;
      functioning. Based on the existing literature on MP (Bales, Wagner, Kline, &amp; Dixon, 2009;&#xD;
      Harel et al., 2009), we expect that MP will enhance processing speed and attention, with&#xD;
      little impact on other cognitive functions such as memory or executive control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: Our DBRCT will be the first to empirically assess the efficacy of MP as a&#xD;
      treatment of MS-related fatigue. The application of the stringent RCT methodology will result&#xD;
      in Class I evidence supporting or refuting the efficacy MP as a fatigue-relieving drug. The&#xD;
      amelioration of fatigue in MS will have a significant positive impact on the MS population,&#xD;
      given the prevalence and negative effects of fatigue.&#xD;
