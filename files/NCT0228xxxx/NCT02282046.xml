  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to understand the impact of glycemic control in patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes on dental implants under long-term function. It is hypothesized that poor glycemic&#xD;
      control will not have significant effects on implant-related outcomes over longer periods of&#xD;
      time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This single-center prospective observational cohort study seeks to clarify the role of&#xD;
      glycemic control as a risk determinant for survival of dental implants and biologic&#xD;
      complications of dental implant therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes. Long-term implant&#xD;
      stability and implant-related complications will be assessed in relation to glycated&#xD;
      hemoglobin levels over time in poorly-controlled and well-controlled diabetics and in&#xD;
      non-diabetic participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: To determine the impact of glycemic control in type 2 diabetes patients on&#xD;
      implant-related biologic complications, integration and survival for dental implants under&#xD;
      long-term functional loading (&gt;1 year).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: To examine these associations relative to long-term effects of sub-optimal&#xD;
      glycemic control on two different anatomic/restorative schemes (fixed partial or removable&#xD;
      complete) Outcomes: Assessments include implant survival, implant-related biologic&#xD;
      complications and resonance frequency analysis as a measure of implant stabilization.&#xD;
      Outcomes will be analyzed relative to glycated hemoglobin levels (HbA1c) taken at 6-month&#xD;
      intervals over the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total study population will consist of 163 participants who will be followed for at least&#xD;
      2 years. This will include enrolling from a group of 141 patients who have previously&#xD;
      received implant therapy as part of short-term assessments regarding diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the study plans to enroll 42 participants who would benefit from implant&#xD;
      supported denture therapy as done in the prior studies. These participants will be classified&#xD;
      into 3 separate groups depending on the A1C reading at time of implant placement. The&#xD;
      criteria being followed for the groups are HbA1c&lt; 6.0% (non-diabetic), 6.0%&lt;HbA1c&lt;8.0% (well&#xD;
      controlled diabetic) and 8.0%&lt;HbA1c&lt;12.0% (poorly controlled diabetic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A review of the potential participant's health is completed at the time of screening. The&#xD;
      implant surgeon will determine if a patient is healthy for surgery with no anticipated health&#xD;
      complications. If a health concern is evident that precludes implant placement, the patient&#xD;
      will be excluded from study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The age requirement for the study is 25 years of age or older. It is expected that most&#xD;
      participants will be 50 years and over due to the specific clinical requirements for the&#xD;
      treatment being followed. Individuals of any gender, race, and ethnicity may participate in&#xD;
      this study. Most patients live locally in San Antonio, TX and some are from the surrounding&#xD;
      cities.&#xD;

        Patients will include those edentulous patients benefiting from mandibular implant&#xD;
        overdenture support. It may include those already being followed in a similar study or&#xD;
        patients newly receiving dental implants. It will also include type 2 diabetes patients who&#xD;
        received dental implant therapy as part of a previous study on the impact of glycemic&#xD;
