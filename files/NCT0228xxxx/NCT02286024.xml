    <textblock>
      Depression is a debilitating illness with a risk of developing a treatment resistant form.&#xD;
      Currently, diagnosis is purely clinical with little features available to identify&#xD;
      potentially adverse developments. Clinical features such as early onset age, prolonged&#xD;
      episodes, anxiety, somatic symptoms and apathy are all arguments raising fears the onset of&#xD;
      resistance to conventional treatments. According to neuroimaging knowledge about the&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanisms, involving front-limbic functional networks supporting the&#xD;
      functions of emotional regulation and reward system, recent work has focused on the&#xD;
      identification of neuroimaging biomarkers predicting therapeutic response. Among the regions&#xD;
      of interest identified, the anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and regions&#xD;
      participating in the Default Mode Network Training (Medial prefrontal cortex, posterior&#xD;
      cingulate cortex, inferior parietal lobe) are most frequently areas associated with the&#xD;
      prediction of therapeutic response. Limitations most reported in these studies are the&#xD;
      heterogeneity of experimental paradigms (resting state, cognitive or emotional functional&#xD;
      tasks), imaging (PET scan, MRI) the heterogeneity of clinical resistance criteria forms&#xD;
      studied, different techniques (as that we consider remission (threshold score) or response&#xD;
      (50% decrease from baseline score), and the sample size. Knowing that MRI into daily clinical&#xD;
      practice in the SHU of Adult Psychiatry, as the balance sheet of the disease, monitoring its&#xD;
      evolution, as in assumption rTMS (repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) (pretreatment&#xD;
      assessment and neuro), the identification of neuroimaging biomarkers in a population of&#xD;
      patients with clinical criteria of Mood Depressive Episode, with an acquisition of identical&#xD;
      and reproducible image daily routine methodology appears to be a reliable way to correct the&#xD;
      heterogeneity of conventionally published studies on the topic. This study aim to identify,&#xD;
      in routine care, predictive clinical and neuroimaging markers of poor outcome in major&#xD;
      depressive disorder.&#xD;

      The main objective is to assess neuroimaging biomarkers like cortical thickness predictive of&#xD;
      poor outcome in major depressive disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identifying neuroimaging biomarker like Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) predictive of poor&#xD;
           outcome in major depressive disorder;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identifying morphological biomarker like volumetric abnormalities (Voxel Based&#xD;
           Morphometry - VBM), other than the cortical thickness, predictive of poor outcome in&#xD;
           major depressive disorder;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identifying clinical features (sociodemographic, clinical dimensions such as apathy or&#xD;
           anxiety) predictive of poor outcome of depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study expect to assess on a large population of patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical and neuroimaging markers (morphological and perfusion) predictive of poor&#xD;
           outcome in major depressive disorder, allowing early identification of patients at risk&#xD;
           of poor therapeutic response. These markers should allow a better stratification of&#xD;
           patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A better characterization of pathophysiological processes involved in major depressive&#xD;
           disorder at different stages of the illness;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Development of innovative technologies such as treatment with repetitive transcranial&#xD;
           magnetic stimulation, or neurofeedback using real time fMRI, on both aspects of&#xD;
           evaluation of the effectiveness and optimization of procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such a study would open up on thinking in terms of therapeutic management. Indeed, recurrent&#xD;
      and potentially resistant forms and screened using such predictive neuroimaging biomarkers&#xD;
      could serve more specific therapeutic approaches in a preventive approach.&#xD;
