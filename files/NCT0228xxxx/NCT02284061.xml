      Context: Sport and physical activity during and after cancer treatment can improve fitness&#xD;
      and social inclusion in adults. In children, although early studies show interesting results,&#xD;
      conclusive data are lacking. A preliminary evaluation conducted in a dozen children following&#xD;
      a physical training program showed a significant improvement in endurance, muscle tone,&#xD;
      overall self-esteem, sports skills and self-perceived strength. The investigators then want&#xD;
      to evaluate the health of a group of children during treat cancer that physical activities&#xD;
      adapted compared to children who did not practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Measuring the impact of physical activity program on health of children and&#xD;
      adolescents with cancer with improved physical, psychological health, social reintegration&#xD;
      and reduced time hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method and Design: The study plans to include 90 children from the pediatric hematology -&#xD;
      oncology department of the La Timone CHU, aged 5-19 years with cancer, over a period of 18&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized controlled open trial open with a stratified distribution. Children will&#xD;
      be randomized between two arms - Arm A (Experimental - Immediate Program): the child follows&#xD;
      the physical activity program for a period of 18 months, as soon as his medical condition&#xD;
      permits. - Arm B (Control - Delayed Program): the child does not participate to the program&#xD;
      during the first 6 months, and he joins the delayed program late after 6 months. Each child&#xD;
      integrates the physical program for a period of one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless of the randomization arm, the child performs the initial tests, the intermediate&#xD;
      tests at 6 and 12 months and final tests at 18 months. Follow-up physical testing will be&#xD;
      performed at 3 and 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physical activity program includes a minimum of 30 days of activities per 6 months&#xD;
      (4days/month and a long stay). The child practice between 2 to 4 hours of activity per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim at demonstrating a difference of 50 meters on the total walked distance&#xD;
      during the endurance test in the experimental group as compared to the control group after 6&#xD;
      months of program.&#xD;
