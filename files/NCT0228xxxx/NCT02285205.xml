  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lobeglitazone is highly selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonist&#xD;
      that decreases insulin resistance in the periphery and liver resulting in increased&#xD;
      insulin-dependent glucose disposal and decreased hepatic glucose output. In vivo, It&#xD;
      demonstrates that Lobeglitazone improves even more glycemic and lipid control in comparison&#xD;
      to rosiglitazone and pioglitazone. Currently, thiazolidinediones such as pioglitazone is the&#xD;
      only drug which is considered as an effective therapeutic agent for improving non-alcoholic&#xD;
      fatty liver disease (NALFD) in type 2 diabetes (T2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this multicenter, prospective, open-labeled, single-arm, exploratory phase 4 study&#xD;
      is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Lobeglitazone once daily for 24 weeks on&#xD;
      intrahepatic fat contents assessed by transient elastography (fibroscan) in T2D with NAFLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifty subjects with T2D and NAFLD will take Lobeglitazone (0.5mg/tablet, orally, 1 tablet&#xD;
      once daily) for 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint is changes from baseline in controlled attenuation parameters (CAP) measured&#xD;
      by transient elastography (fibroscan) after treatment with Lobeglitazone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints are changes from baseline in glycemic profiles (HbA1c, Glycated albumin),&#xD;
      Lipid parameters (Total Cholesterol, Triglycerides, HDL-C, LDL-C), Liver function parameters&#xD;
      (AST, ALT, r-GT), and adverse events during the trial.&#xD;
