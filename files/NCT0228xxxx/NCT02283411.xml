    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Abbott Sensor&#xD;
      Based Glucose Monitoring System Personal (System-P) and Abbott Sensor Based Glucose&#xD;
      Monitoring System Professional (System-Pro) when used as an adjunct to blood glucose testing&#xD;
      over a 14-day wear period in adult subjects. The Abbott Sensor Based Glucose Monitoring&#xD;
      System - Professional Sensors will be worn by adult subjects over a 14-day wear period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to characterize the Systems performance with respect to Yellow&#xD;
      Spring Instrument (YSI) reference venous sample measurements. The device performance will be&#xD;
      primarily evaluated in terms of point and rate accuracy of the Abbott Sensor Based Glucose&#xD;
      Monitoring Systems in reference to YSI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety of the Abbott Sensor Based Glucose Monitoring Systems will be characterized by Adverse&#xD;
      Device Effects and Serious Adverse Device Effects experienced by study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      240 subjects will be enrolled and additional healthy subjects may also be enrolled in the&#xD;
      study as training subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sensors are inserted into the back of the subject's upper arm for up to fourteen (14) days.&#xD;
      The subjects are expected to perform capillary BG tests during the 14-day sensor wear. Three&#xD;
      in clinic visits are scheduled during the 14-day sensor wear period. During each in-clinic&#xD;
      visit, study staff performed IV blood draws to obtain venous blood for YSI reference glucose&#xD;
      measurements.&#xD;

    <description>Point accuracy of the system was evaluated as the proportion of System readings that are within ±20% of the YSI reference value for glucose levels ≥ 80 mg/dL and within ±20 mg/dL for YSI glucose levels &lt;80 mg/dL. All 125 subjects wore both System-P and System-Pro Sensors and were included in the outcome measure. System P, the Personal System which is intended for single patient use and System Pro is intended for use by healthcare professionals (HCP).
