      This is an exploratory study and the primary objective is the immunogenicity and feasibility&#xD;
      of combined chemotherapy-DC vaccination. The secondary objectives are the toxicity and&#xD;
      clinical efficacy. This study will provide important data on the immunological efficacy of DC&#xD;
      immunochemotherapy.&#xD;

      1. Rationale Investigators have explored immunotherapy and have now vaccinated well over&#xD;
           200 stage III and IV melanoma patients in the Netherlands with monocyte-derived&#xD;
           dendritic cell (DC) vaccines and proved that DC therapy is safe with minimal side&#xD;
           effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy have long been viewed as strategies that&#xD;
           directly impact the viability of the tumor cell, and that the immune system contributed&#xD;
           little to their efficacy. The commonly held opinion was that chemotherapy and&#xD;
           immunotherapy could not be combined because of the myelo-suppressive effect of most&#xD;
           chemotherapeutic agents. However, it becomes increasingly obvious that chemotherapy also&#xD;
           possess the capacity to trigger tumor antigen release and danger signals in a manner&#xD;
           that provokes engagement of innate and adaptive immunity that may be capitalized upon.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Small proof-of-concept clinical trials in cancer patients indicate that the efficacy of&#xD;
           anti-cancer vaccines may indeed be enhanced by chemotherapy [2]. Also preliminary&#xD;
           observations indicate that chemotherapeutic agents, in particular platinum compounds&#xD;
           (cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin) are immunogenic and may contribute to reverse&#xD;
           tumor cell induced immunosuppression/immune deviation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Investigators hypothesize that DC vaccination, when combined with other more&#xD;
           conventional anti-tumor treatments such as chemotherapy, that eradicate large numbers of&#xD;
           cancer cells, may allow the T cells to clear the remaining cancer cells and to provide&#xD;
           immunological memory to prevent relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objectives This is an exploratory study and the primary objective is the immunogenicity&#xD;
           and feasibility of combined chemotherapy-DC vaccination. The secondary objectives are&#xD;
           the toxicity and clinical efficacy. This study will provide important data on the&#xD;
           immunological efficacy of DC immunochemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study design This study is an open label randomized phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study population Our study population consists of melanoma patients, with expression of&#xD;
           melanoma associated tumor antigens gp100 and tyrosinase. Melanoma patients with regional&#xD;
           lymph node metastasis in whom a radical lymph node dissection is performed within 2&#xD;
           months of inclusion in this study (further referred to as stage III) and melanoma&#xD;
           patients with measurable distant metastases (further referred to as stage IV) will be&#xD;
           included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Main study endpoints The primary objective of the study is to investigate the&#xD;
           immunogenicity and feasibility of combined chemotherapy-DC vaccination. The secondary&#xD;
           objective is to investigate the toxicity and clinical responses (only in stage IV) upon&#xD;
           DC immunochemotherapy.&#xD;
