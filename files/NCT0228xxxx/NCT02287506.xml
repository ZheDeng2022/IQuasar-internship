      This study aims to achieve more accurate early classification of diabetes and identification&#xD;
      of which patients will rapidly require insulin treatment. The investigators will recruit 1000&#xD;
      participants who have been diagnosed with diabetes in the last year and were aged between 18&#xD;
      and 50 years at the time of diagnosis. The investigators will recruit an additional cohort of&#xD;
      400 participants diagnosed after age 50 treated with insulin at recruitment. The&#xD;
      investigators will record clinical features and biomarkers that may help us to determine&#xD;
      diabetes type at diagnosis and follow participants for 3 years to assess the development of&#xD;
      severe insulin deficiency (measured using C-peptide) and insulin requirement. The&#xD;
      investigators will assess utility of clinical features and additional biomarkers in&#xD;
      identifying patients with rapid progression to insulin requirement. Findings will be&#xD;
      integrated into a freely available clinical prediction model.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is stratified into recognised subtypes with major implications for patients'&#xD;
      treatment. The treatment of Type 1 diabetes (T1D), Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and Maturity-onset&#xD;
      diabetes of the young (MODY) is markedly different and based on clear differences in&#xD;
      underlying pathophysiology. The difficult part of this stratification is correctly diagnosing&#xD;
      the subtype especially in young adults. The clear differentiation of T1D as slim and young,&#xD;
      and T2D as obese and old, no longer holds with the rapid increase in obesity in the&#xD;
      population: T1D patients may be obese and T2D patients may be diagnosed young. 90% of MODY&#xD;
      patients are misdiagnosed with T1D or T2D as the diagnosis of MODY is rarely considered. This&#xD;
      results in 7-15% of young adults with diabetes being wrongly classified and incorrectly&#xD;
      treated. Initial clinical diagnosis is not systematic and once made is rarely changed.&#xD;
      Misdiagnosis of T2D or MODY as T1D results in unnecessary initial insulin treatment leading&#xD;
      to higher drug/monitoring costs, more side effects (weight gain, hypos), and patient&#xD;
      inconvenience/dissatisfaction. Misdiagnosis of T1D as T2D, or MODY (initial treatment&#xD;
      diet/tablets), results in poor glycaemic control, frequent contact for increased treatment,&#xD;
      inappropriate insulin regimes and the risk of life threatening ketoacidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have developed an optimized diagnostic strategy (ODS) based on integrating&#xD;
      Clinical information (a validated clinical probability model), Biomarkers (GAD, Islet&#xD;
      antigen-2 (IA2) and ZnT8 autoantibodies) and Genetic testing for MODY. This has the potential&#xD;
      to determine the subtype of diabetes in young adults leading to improved treatment and care.&#xD;
      Prior to undertaking a comprehensive RCT to test our ODS against standard care, the&#xD;
      investigators must first undertake this pilot study to assess the feasibility of such a&#xD;
      project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To assess the feasibility of recruitment and retention for a proposed large scale&#xD;
      RCT, optimize recruitment and retention strategies, develop and assess the protocols and&#xD;
      procedures, test delivery of the ODS, assess the impact of the ODS and obtain pilot data to&#xD;
      inform sample size calculations for the proposed RCT Potential participants will be&#xD;
      identified from routine clinical care, with clinicians informing patients of the project in&#xD;
      general terms and seeking permission for their contact details to be passed to the research&#xD;
      team. A range of referral strategies will be assessed and all potential participants who&#xD;
      appear to meet the entry criteria will be invited to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Referral strategies to be assessed will include: referral to research team by GP/ Practice&#xD;
      Nurse/diabetes specialist nurse, regular GP practice database searches, via pathology lab&#xD;
      following raised Hba1c Initial visit (I hour): Participants will meet with a member of the&#xD;
      research team who will obtain consent and collect baseline blood samples, demographic and QoL&#xD;
      data. Participants will be randomised to either the intervention or control arm using a&#xD;
      computer generated randomisation schedule. For participants in the intervention arm the blood&#xD;
      samples will be analysed at the Royal Devon &amp;Exeter National Health Service Foundation Trust&#xD;
      (RD&amp;E NHS FT) Biochemistry Department for HbA1c, C-peptide and islet autoantibodies (GAD, IA2&#xD;
      and ZnT8) with DNA extracted and stored for genetic testing if appropriate. These blood&#xD;
      results will then be immediately incorporated into the ODS for feedback to Clinicians and&#xD;
      participants with recommendations that appropriate national guidelines for the ODS diagnosis&#xD;
      (e.g. NICE guidelines for Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes) are followed. For participants in the&#xD;
      control arm their current clinical features will be recorded and their blood samples will be&#xD;
      stored for future analysis. At the end of their involvement in the study, both recorded&#xD;
      clinical features and results from stored blood samples will then be and incorporated into&#xD;
      the ODS for feedback to both clinicians and participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up (6 monthly intervals over 3 years): Participants will then be followed up at 6&#xD;
      monthly intervals over a 3 year period (choice given of text, phone, or email) to maintain&#xD;
      participant engagement and enable collection of details of current treatment, treatment&#xD;
      changes and frequency of hypoglycaemia. Results from routinely collected HbA1cs will be&#xD;
      obtained from clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 3 years, participants will be seen again by the research team for collection of a further&#xD;
      blood sample, details of final treatment and quality of life measures. This will end their&#xD;
      participation. At the end of the study individual results from the ODS for those in the&#xD;
      control (standard care) arm will be generated and fed back to clinicians and participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be assigned a unique study ID. All data collected will be recorded and&#xD;
      stored under this ID number. Data will be initially recorded onto a study specific data&#xD;
      collection form (DCF). Data will then be recorded onto a study specific database.&#xD;
      Hard/scanned copies will be stored in the study specific site file. Data will be screening&#xD;
      for discrepancies and missing data prior to analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data will include: personal identifiers, anthropometry, diabetes and medication&#xD;
      history and blood biochemistry. Permission will be obtained to access medical notes should&#xD;
      this be required for diabetes data relevant to taking part in the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participant data will be held in a link-anonymised format, Participants' research and&#xD;
      sample data will be identified by unique study ID numbers and all data will be held on&#xD;
      password-protected computers. Only the CI or designated research team member will have access&#xD;
      to personal identifiable data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Storage and Archiving: All consent and paper data collection forms will be scanned onto&#xD;
      discs and stored in locked filing cabinets within the controlled access ECRF for the duration&#xD;
      of the project. Paper copies will be shredded. Should a full RCT be developed from this&#xD;
      project participant data and samples will be transferred and used for analysis in the larger&#xD;
      study. If at the end of this study the RCT has not yet been commenced, remaining samples and&#xD;
      data will be transferred for safe keeping to the Peninsula Research Bank (PRB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample analysis: Blood samples will be analysed for HbA1c, C-peptide and islet autoantibodies&#xD;
      (GAD, IA2 and ZnT8) on site at the RD&amp;E NHS FT blood sciences department. DNA will be&#xD;
      extracted and stored for genetic testing if appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome measures:Time to optimum treatment following diagnosis. Optimum treatment&#xD;
      will be determined at 3 year follow up on the basis of whether insulin is required or not&#xD;
      (using C peptide testing if on insulin and HbA1c testing if not on insulin). If insulin is&#xD;
      not required then the optimum treatment will be determined using the treatment guidelines for&#xD;
      T2D or the subtype of MODY diagnosed. Treatment will be recorded 6-monthly up to 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures: Mean glycaemic control over the first 3y after diagnosis, patient&#xD;
      satisfaction, number of hypos, weight change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics and Power Calculations The aim of this study is to determine feasibility for a&#xD;
      future RCT, not to determine clinical differences. The investigators have therefore taken a&#xD;
      pragmatic approach based on the number of potential recruits available over a one year&#xD;
      period. The investigators estimate 220 people are diagnosed per year in Exeter and&#xD;
      surrounding area. The investigators will invite all patients who fulfil the entry criteria to&#xD;
      participate. This will enable us to determine a realistic recruitment rate and obtain&#xD;
      estimates of rates of misclassification to inform the full RCT. Therefore, analysis will be&#xD;
      restricted to descriptive statistics only&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations: The investigators have discussed the potential ethical considerations&#xD;
      with members of our PRB steering committee and addressed them as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling: a routine part diabetes care, may result in slight pain and bruising, risks&#xD;
      minimized by sampling undertaken by staff experienced in venepuncture procedures. Patient&#xD;
      burden: participation involves 2 blood samples (3 years apart) and 5 follow up contacts over&#xD;
      the 3 year period (via participant choice of phone/e-mail/text). This was not considered&#xD;
      unduly burdensome. Immediate/delayed ODS feedback: following considerable discussion around&#xD;
      the acceptability of immediate or delayed feedback of results from the ODS, our lay members&#xD;
      felt that considering all participants would receive treatment based on current clinical and&#xD;
      NICE guidelines the delay in feedback of ODS results would be acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Withdrawal: Subjects will be informed that they are free to withdraw from the study&#xD;
      at any time up until the samples and data are coded but not anonymised. When samples are&#xD;
      fully anonymised, the participants will still be able to withdraw but their samples and&#xD;
      associated data will be retained for use in analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Management:The study will be managed by the National Institute of Health s Research&#xD;
      (NIHR) Exeter Clinical Research Facility providing infrastructure support and facilitate&#xD;
      recruitment and sample collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timescale: 4 years. This is a relatively long time for a pilot study and is necessary to&#xD;
      enable data collection from each participant, over a 3 year period, to provide a clinically&#xD;
      relevant definition of optimal treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All costs will be met by existing research funding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample analysis costs (HbA1c/Serum c-peptide, islet autoantibodies (GAD, IA2 and ZnT8) and&#xD;
      Genotyping where appropriate) will be covered by the CI's existing Welcome Trust senior&#xD;
      Investigator award. Service support costs will be provided by the NIHR Exeter Clinical&#xD;
      Research Facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project development and user involvement: The study team will have access to the user&#xD;
      representative group of the NIHR Exeter Clinical Research Facility (ECRF). In keeping with&#xD;
      the NHS Patient Carer and Public Involvement (PCPI) strategy the ECRF invites user&#xD;
      representatives to contribute to the development of various projects within its portfolio.&#xD;
      These individuals have agreed to maintain contact and regular meetings have been established&#xD;
      at which researchers discuss the development of current projects within the ECRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reporting adverse effects: This is a low risk study and it is not anticipated that&#xD;
      participants involved in this project will be subject to adverse effects, other than slight&#xD;
      bruising from blood sample collection. The CI will be informed of any adverse effects within&#xD;
      24 hours and they will be reported following local NHS R&amp;D SOPs with a copy of any adverse&#xD;
      event form stored in the project site file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Feedback: Depending on the randomization arm feedback from the ODS will be fed&#xD;
      back to participants and their GP immediately or at the end of the study. Should any&#xD;
      biochemistry immunological or genetic result potentially impact on clinical care, the results&#xD;
      will be initially discussed with the ECRF Clinical Director and a decision may be made to&#xD;
      contact that individual participants GP or healthcare team. A statement to this effect is&#xD;
      included in the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination/implementation of research: Results will be written up and submitted for&#xD;
      publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Abstracts will be submitted to national and&#xD;
      international conferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential impact and benefit of the research: short term- the investigators hope to obtain&#xD;
      the necessary information to conduct a definitive RCT. Longer term-evidence that the ODS can&#xD;
      improve diagnosis and treatment for patients diagnosed with diabetes will lead to improved&#xD;
      treatment and quality of life for patients and a reduction in the NHS costs associated with&#xD;
      inappropriate treatment and monitoring and complication rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Study: the study will finish when all initial and follow up data has been collected&#xD;
      and analysed on all participants.&#xD;
