      Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an 'N-of-one' observational study focusing on individuals with a hereditary&#xD;
      predisposition to cancer due to a genetic mutation in the TP53 gene. An individual with this&#xD;
      mutation has a &gt;90% chance of developing many different forms of cancer in their lifetime.&#xD;
      Since germline TP53 gene mutation carriers are highly susceptible to cancer, cancer&#xD;
      prevention strategies and early cancer detection strategies are crucial. Unfortunately, the&#xD;
      current standard of care for monitoring germline TP53 gene mutation carriers for early signs&#xD;
      of cancer is yearly MRI scans and intermittent blood draws. Villani et al. showed that&#xD;
      standard monitoring is inadequate and introduced a more sophisticated protocol for early&#xD;
      cancer detection. We extended the Villani et al. protocol to include a number of markers for&#xD;
      early detection and are currently vetting their utility, in terms of their inherent&#xD;
      variability, patient tolerability of frequent interrogation, and ability to show changes that&#xD;
      might indicate a need for further examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the markers being collected, important covariate information, such as diet,&#xD;
      sleep, and activities are being collected (via, e.g., wearable wireless devices) in order to&#xD;
      take them into account in assessing the levels of the markers at a single data collection&#xD;
      time or over time. One important aspect of the protocol is to identify changes, rather than&#xD;
      specific levels, in marker status over time for an individual that might be indicative of&#xD;
      tumor formation, essentially exploiting the concept of 'personalized thresholds' discussed by&#xD;
      Drescher et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If any indication of the presence of a cancer, tumorigenic process, or general sign of&#xD;
      ill-health is observed, the protocol calls for a discussion of the findings among the&#xD;
      research team, followed by a discussion between the clinical lead on the research team and&#xD;
      the primary care provider and/or specialists overseeing a participating patient's care,&#xD;
      possible validation of the assay(s) motivating the discussions, and a decision on how to&#xD;
      intervene on the part of the primary care provider and/or specialists.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Individuals who carry certain germline TP53 gene mutations are highly susceptible to cancer&#xD;
      and are likely to develop any one, or many, cancer types during their lifetimes. Prevention&#xD;
      strategies and early tumor detection strategies are crucial for such individuals. It has been&#xD;
      shown by Villani et al. that aggressive monitoring of markers of cancer can lead to much&#xD;
      better outcomes (e.g., earlier detection of cancer) than standard monitoring protocols.&#xD;
      However, the choice of markers for use in early detection that can indicate the presence of&#xD;
      cancer and surveillance and monitoring strategies of patients or individuals with specific&#xD;
      cancer predispositions, such as inherited cancer syndromes, is complex. This choice is often&#xD;
      guided by the observed utility of a set of markers among a broader list of potential markers&#xD;
      in large-scale population-level clinical studies. However, the utility of an early detection&#xD;
      or surveillance strategy based on a set of markers in the population at large does not&#xD;
      necessarily translate to the utility of those markers for a particular individual. This&#xD;
      phenomenon is even more problematic for individuals with rare hereditary cancer syndromes and&#xD;
      conditions, such as individuals with germline TP53 gene mutations, as these individuals are&#xD;
      highly susceptible to different types of cancer over their lifetimes. Even among individuals&#xD;
      with TP53 mutations there is variation in the age-of-onset of cancers due to other factors,&#xD;
      such as exposures to carcinogenic substances and the presences of other susceptibility&#xD;
      mutations (Arrifin et al. 2015). In addition, given that individuals with inherited TP53&#xD;
      mutations are indeed rare, there are no large-scale studies that have been pursued to&#xD;
      identify sets of markers that might be useful for monitoring TP53 mutation carriers going&#xD;
      forward for signs of cancer and or disease generally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, individuals who inherit DNA sequence variants in the TP53 gene have a greater&#xD;
      than 90% chance of developing cancers in their lifetimes and often develop multiple&#xD;
      sequential cancers during their lives. Women who carry a TP53 mutation have an 82% chance of&#xD;
      developing cancer before age 45 (Chompret A et al. 2000) and, in general, the average age of&#xD;
      onset of cancer for individuals carrying TP53 mutations is 28 years old, but these statistics&#xD;
      do not take into account other factors, such as the type of mutation present and the genetic&#xD;
      background and settings in which the carriers live. (Ruijs et al. 2010; Sagne et al. 2014;&#xD;
      Petitjean et al. 2007) Individuals who ultimately develop cancer and harbor inherited TP53&#xD;
      gene mutations are described in the medical literature as having 'Li-Fraumeni Syndrome'.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, TP53 mutation-carrying relatives of individuals with either frank Li-Fraumeni&#xD;
      syndrome or who carry mutations in the TP53 gene (that have not yet developed cancer) have an&#xD;
      even more elevated risk of developing cancer.(Hwang et al. 2003; Nichols et al. 2001) In&#xD;
      addition, it has been shown that 'anticipation' occurs in families with Li-Fraumeni syndrome,&#xD;
      such that the age of onset of cancer formation is earlier from generation to generation,&#xD;
      putting those TP53 mutation carriers with older relatives who developed early onset cancer at&#xD;
      even greater risk of developing cancer early in life. (Trkova et al. 2002; Arrifini et al.&#xD;
      2015)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In light of these findings, individual carriers of TP53 mutations with siblings who have&#xD;
      developed Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and who are in families in which individuals in older&#xD;
      generations have had early onset cancer, are much more likely to develop very early onset&#xD;
      cancers and should be monitored closely for signs of cancer. In fact, the documented&#xD;
      age-of-onset of specific cancers has been described in the literature. Table 1 shows the&#xD;
      ranges of the average age-of-onset of different cancers depending on the measured activation&#xD;
      levels of the mutant TP53 protein, based on the data described in the study by Petitjean et&#xD;
      al. (2007) Note first that most TP53 mutation carriers develop multiple cancers over their&#xD;
      lifetimes, such that the age-of-onsets of the cancers in Table 1 may be associated with a&#xD;
      second or third cancer developed by a carrier. Second, note that categories such as 'soft&#xD;
      tissue sarcoma' refer to a number of types of cancer and not a single cancer. These facts&#xD;
      suggest that monitoring such individuals for early signs of cancer, even before adulthood,&#xD;
      should be of benefit, especially for soft tissue, brain, and bone sarcomas. Importantly, it&#xD;
      has been shown that early detection of cancers in carriers of TP53 mutations, or those with&#xD;
      frank Li-Fraumeni syndrome, can dramatically enhance survival and the effectiveness of&#xD;
      therapeutic interventions, as described by Villani et al. (2011) among others. However,&#xD;
      sophisticated and comprehensive patient monitoring schemes that can facilitate the detection&#xD;
      of early signs of cancer in individuals carrying TP53 mutations are lacking, although the few&#xD;
      markers used in the study by Villani et al. (2011) were shown to have promise. In addition,&#xD;
      the currently accepted and insurance-reimbursable monitoring practices for TP53 mutation&#xD;
      carriers is one whole body image per year, which is simply inadequate and has in fact been&#xD;
      shown to be inadequate in the clinical study by Villani et al. (2011)&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result of these facts, the current project was designed to develop a prototype&#xD;
      longitudinal 'biomarker' (e.g., blood based proteins) and 'biometric' (e.g., imaging or&#xD;
      wearable wireless device) monitoring strategy for carriers of the TP53 mutation with an even&#xD;
      more pronounced predisposition to cancer due to familial aggregation of cancer. This&#xD;
      monitoring strategy could be useful in identifying changes in those biomarkers that might&#xD;
      either reflect cancer formation or health-related phenomena that may exacerbate&#xD;
      susceptibility to cancer. The project will leverage different markers, assays and devices, as&#xD;
      well the development of an analysis and prototype visualization method for drawing inferences&#xD;
      from the marker and device data. Ultimately, the protocol will be focused on the objective,&#xD;
      statistical evidence-based assessment of the utility of biomarker-based surveillance methods&#xD;
      for an individual subject carrying a TP53 mutation in a high-cancer susceptibility setting&#xD;
      (e.g., a sibling with Li-Fraumeni syndrome and familial cancers in older generations). The&#xD;
      protocol will include the vetted markers described by Villani et al.(1) as well as a more&#xD;
      comprehensive set of markers, biometrics and procedures in order to increase the likelihood&#xD;
      of detecting values or changes in the status of these markers of likely biomedical&#xD;
      importance. Since over 50% (4/7) of the cancer survivors successfully monitored in the&#xD;
      Villani et al. (2011) study were under age 20, the fact that the age-of-onset of cancer among&#xD;
      TP53 mutation carriers is lowest for those with a family history of Li-Fraumeni and early&#xD;
      onset cancers, and the published reports state age-of-onset of cancer among TP53 mutation&#xD;
      carriers is so low (e.g., Table 1), we believe that deploying this protocol in minors and&#xD;
      children is justified. Since many of the biomarkers to be studied are likely to have a&#xD;
      genetic basis, it makes sense to collect phenotypes and biosamples from family members of the&#xD;
      target patient so that their values can act as control values for the target patient's&#xD;
      values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The markers and frequency with which they are being collected via the protocol for the&#xD;
      currently enrolled patient include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whole body Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) analyses every 4-6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Focused bilateral breast MRI every 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abdominal ultrasound imaging every 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stool microbiome via shotgun sequencing every two weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Extensive blood metabolite profiling once a month&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Circulating cell-free DNA once a month&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DNA repair assay results from blood cells once a month&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Literature-backed early cancer detection blood-based markers once every two months&#xD;
           (17-OH-pregnenolone, testosterone, progesterone, 11 deoxycortisol, deoxycorticosterone&#xD;
           (DOC), beta-2-microglobulin, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), Cancer Antigen 125&#xD;
           (CA-125), β-human chorionic gonadotropin(β-HCG), alpha-fetoprotein, 17-OH-progesterone,&#xD;
           androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), lactate dehydrogenase).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete blood count information once every two months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum electrolyte and liver function tests once every two months (sodium, potassium,&#xD;
           chloride, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, calcium, albumin, total&#xD;
           protein, bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline&#xD;
           phosphatase)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed, single-subject, or 'N-of-1' study design will involve longitudinal data&#xD;
      collections (i.e., repeated samplings) on the TP53 carrier to detect likely&#xD;
      health-informative changes over time. We emphasize that many of the biomarkers and biometrics&#xD;
      to be studied have the potential to detect cancer, but may also simply provide indications of&#xD;
      health status changes generally and as such we envision the proposed study as one focusing on&#xD;
      the prototyping and implementation of a system for monitoring biomarkers that may detect&#xD;
      tumor formation or indicate health status changes that could warrant further scrutiny.&#xD;
