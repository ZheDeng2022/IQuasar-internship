    <textblock>
      This pilot study will test Nilotinib's ability to alter the abnormal protein build up in&#xD;
      Parkinson disease and Diffuse Lewey Body Disease patients . Patients will receive Nilotinib&#xD;
      at different doses for 6 months. Patients will then be tested to see if there is change in&#xD;
      three areas: 1) has the disease symptoms changed. 2) has levels of a specific misfolded&#xD;
      protein changed in the fluid around their brain and spine. 3) Have inflammatory markers&#xD;
      changed in the patient's blood and fluid around their brain and spine. If successful, this&#xD;
      drug could be used to slow down or stop the progression of disorders that involve abnormal&#xD;
      collection of misfolded proteins. However, the main purpose of this pilot study is to check&#xD;
      for the safety of using this medication at this level.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in α-synuclein and Tau concentrations in the CSF and serum of patients</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Working Hypothesis: PD patients have been shown to have elevated levels of α-synuclein in their CSF. Nilotinib has been shown to reduce α-synuclein and Tau in the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system in animal models, and similarly, we propose will show changes in CSF and serum α-synuclein concentrations in nilotinib treated PD patients.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine nilotinib's efficacy by improvement in motor and non-motor symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Working Hypothesis: By following strict safety guidelines, monitoring patients through physical examinations, self-examinations, laboratory and neurological examinations, nilotinib will be a safe drug to use in patients with PD and PD related patients.&#xD;
Determine if any clinical benefit is observed in this small, short, limited clinical trial.&#xD;
Working Hypothesis: In cell culture and animal models of PD, dopaminergic neurons have shown increased cell death with accumulating α-synuclein. Therefore, PD patients treated with nilotinib, which lowers α-synuclein and Tau in vivo and in vitro studies, will have improvement or stabilization of their motor UPDRS and cognition.</description>
