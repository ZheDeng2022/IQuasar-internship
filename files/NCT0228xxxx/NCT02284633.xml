    <textblock>
      In non-small celled lung cancer (NSCLC) 10-15% of the patients harbor a mutation in the&#xD;
      tumor's epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR M+). This receptor is the target for treatment&#xD;
      with erlotinib. Identification of EGFR M+ is done on a biopsy, which can be difficult to&#xD;
      retrieve. A new blood based test identifies EGFR M+ in plasma, which makes it possible to&#xD;
      monitor the level of EGFR M+ in the patient's blood during treatment. This enables both a&#xD;
      closer monitoring of the treatment with erlotinib and a closer study of the resistance&#xD;
      mechanisms that almost inevitably develop during treatment. A pilot study demonstrated that&#xD;
      the quantity of EGFR M+ in plasma correlates to the response to treatment and might be used&#xD;
      to predict disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with EGFR M+ NSCLC referred to a participating oncology department may be enrolled&#xD;
      in the project. The investigators expect to include 250 patients over a four-year period.&#xD;
      Patients will receive standard treatment and follow up. Standard 1st line treatment for&#xD;
      patients with metastatic disease is tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) eg. erlotinib. A biopsy&#xD;
      and blood sample will be retrieved before treatment with is initiated. The patient will be&#xD;
      monitored prospectively with blood samples every 3rd-6th week both during erlotinib&#xD;
      treatment, subsequent lines of treatment and treatment intermissions. The blood samples are&#xD;
      analyzed for subtypes of EGFR M+ both sensitizing mutations and mutations known to drive&#xD;
      resistance to erlotinib treatment. In the event of occurring resistance mutations or&#xD;
      unexpected increase in quantity of sensitizing mutations clinical action will be taken;&#xD;
      initially in the form of additional scans searching for signs of disease progression.&#xD;
      Clinical data will be retrieved from the patient's medical journal. Patients are followed&#xD;
      until death or at least 24 months after inclusion. Any excess biological material will be&#xD;
      stored for up to 15 years in a bio bank for future research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect our results to validate the use of EGFR M+ detection and quantification via blood&#xD;
      samples in a clinically relevant setting. The investigators expect earlier identification of&#xD;
      disease progression to allow more cases of local treatment thus - hopefully - increasing the&#xD;
      progression free survival. Continued blood monitoring in subsequent lines of treatment and&#xD;
      treatment intermissions will add to our knowledge of the nature of EGFR M+ NSCLC. The&#xD;
      sampling of biological material allows us to further investigate the biology of resistance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Background Non-small celled lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the most common cancers in the&#xD;
      world, and Denmark has one of the highest incidences of approximately 3800 new patients each&#xD;
      year who are diagnosed with NSCLC, and the overall prognosis is very poor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EGF (epidermal growth factor) system with its known receptors and related proteins are&#xD;
      known to play an active role in the development of cancer. In non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC) especially EGFR has been studied. Inhibition of EGFR is associated with prolonged&#xD;
      survival especially in patients with mutations in the EGFR (EGFR M+) 10-15% of the patients&#xD;
      with NSCLC harbor a mutation in the tumor's EGFR. This receptor is the target for treatment&#xD;
      with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) erlotinib. The response rate for erlotinib treatment&#xD;
      in EGFR M+ NSCLC is around 75% as opposed to response rates around 30% for treatment with&#xD;
      traditional chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, resistance mechanisms that cause progression on TKI treatment has been elucidated.&#xD;
      The most common is the T790M mutation in EGFR, but other mechanisms such as increased MET and&#xD;
      HER3 expression is also described. It is estimated that T790M mutations in EGFR accounts for&#xD;
      50% of the cases with TKI resistance development. With the exception of HER3 and MET, which&#xD;
      is estimated to represent less than 5% of the cases with the development of resistance, are&#xD;
      the mutations which cause the remaining 50% of cases, resistance remains unknown. The&#xD;
      revelation of further resistance mutations hampered by the problems of obtaining biopsies&#xD;
      when progression occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of EGFR M+ is done on a tumor biopsy, which can be difficult to retrieve.&#xD;
      Furthermore a biopsy only provides information about a certain part of the one tumor site,&#xD;
      that is tested. The investigators know that tumors especially in NSCLC is a very heterogenous&#xD;
      group. A blood test provides us with e more overall information about the tumor mass of each&#xD;
      specific patient. However tumor DNA is also present in blood of cancer patients in the form&#xD;
      of circulating free DNA. A new blood based test identifies EGFR M+ in plasma, which makes it&#xD;
      possible to monitor the level of EGFR M+ in the patient's blood during treatment. This&#xD;
      enables both a closer monitoring of the treatment with erlotinib and a closer study of the&#xD;
      resistance mechanisms that almost inevitably develop during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot study with 23 EGFR M+ NSCLC patients demonstrated that the quantity of EGFR M+ in&#xD;
      plasma correlates to the response to treatment and might be used to predict disease&#xD;
      progression. In this study resistance mutations were detected between 20-300 days prior to&#xD;
      clinical evidence of disease progression via CT scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective studies suggest that local treatment of oligoprogressive disease markedly&#xD;
      increases progression free survival thus prolonging the time until a change to subsequent&#xD;
      lines of systemic treatment is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Patients with EGFR M+ NSCLC referred to one of the participating oncology departments&#xD;
      may be offered enrollment in the project. A multicenter collaboration allows us to identify&#xD;
      250 EGFR M+ patients in a two-year period (200 patients with metastatic disease and 50&#xD;
      patients with localized disease). The EGFR mutation must be diagnosed via a diagnostic tissue&#xD;
      sample. Patients must be over 18 years and give a written consent before entering the study.&#xD;
      Patients can at any time withdraw their consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will receive standard treatment and follow up. Standard 1st line treatment for&#xD;
      patients with disseminated EGFR M+ disease is erlotinib. Standard follow up during this&#xD;
      treatment is blood testing and clinical evaluation every 6th week and a CT scan evaluated by&#xD;
      the RECIST criteria every 12th week. Additional tests are ordered on clinical indication. A&#xD;
      biopsy and blood sample will be retrieved before treatment with is initiated. The patient&#xD;
      will be monitored prospectively with blood samples (2x10 ml EDTA tubes) every 3rd-6th week&#xD;
      both during erlotinib treatment, subsequent lines of treatment and treatment intermissions.&#xD;
      The blood samples will be transported to the Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Aarhus&#xD;
      University Hospital where it will be analyzed for subtypes of EGFR M+ both sensitizing&#xD;
      mutations and mutations known to drive resistance to erlotinib treatment. Analyses are&#xD;
      performed using the COBAS 4800 light cycler. In the event of occurring resistance mutations&#xD;
      or unexpected increase in quantity of sensitizing mutations clinical action will be taken;&#xD;
      initially in the form of additional scans searching for signs of disease progression.&#xD;
      Clinical data will be retrieved from the patient's medical journal. These data include TNM&#xD;
      status, histology, treatment modality and patient characteristics (gender, age, smoking&#xD;
      status and performance status) Patients are followed until death or at least 24 months after&#xD;
      inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue samples will be examined retrospectively using exom sequencing. Any excess biological&#xD;
      material will with the patients' consent be stored for up to 15 years in a bio bank at -80&#xD;
      degrees celsius. This allows optimal use of the material, because it will make it possible to&#xD;
      conduct future research in the cancer field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and perspectives The overall purpose of this study is to increase our knowledge&#xD;
      concerning molecular mechanisms - especially the development of resistance - in EGFR M+&#xD;
      NSCLC. Increased molecular knowledge is crucial in the development towards a more&#xD;
      personalized cancer care. It provides us with better methods in selecting which treatment is&#xD;
      the optimal choice for each individual patient. The investigators expect our results to&#xD;
      validate the use of EGFR M+ detection and quantification via blood samples in a clinically&#xD;
      relevant setting complementing CT scans in treatment evaluation. The investigators expect to&#xD;
      be able to identify disease progression earlier than it would be possible using CT scans&#xD;
      alone and thereby discovering more cases of oligoprogressive disease eligible for local&#xD;
      treatment thus - hopefully - increasing the progression free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The continuation of blood monitoring in subsequent lines of treatment and treatment&#xD;
      intermissions will add to our knowledge of the nature of EGFR M+ NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally the sampling of biological material makes it possible for us to further&#xD;
      investigate the biology of resistance.&#xD;
