  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Azathioprine (AZA) and its metabolite 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) were developed over 50 years&#xD;
      ago by Gertrude Elion and George Hitchings and were initially used clinically in the&#xD;
      management of childhood leukemia and organ transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first case report of 6-MP use in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was from 1962 , and&#xD;
      since then the use of thiopurines has been well established in the management of moderate to&#xD;
      severe IBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thiopurines offer an inexpensive and effective treatment option for maintenance of remission&#xD;
      of IBD in comparison to biological agents which may be 30 times more expensive .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although 50-60% of IBD patients respond to thiopurines, a significant proportion of patients&#xD;
      will not tolerate them due to various adverse effects . The adverse effects of thiopurines&#xD;
      may be dose related, patient related or idiosyncratic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immunosuppressive effects of thiopurines also increase the rates of opportunistic&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thiopurines are also associated with a higher rate of malignancies, particularly a malignant&#xD;
      Burkitt-like lymphoma, related to Epstein-Barr virus infection . Other adverse effects of&#xD;
      thiopurine relate to allergic phenomenon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An idiosyncratic adverse effect of thiopurine use is acute pancreatitis (AP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute inflammation of the pancreas defined by INSPPIRE criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      requiring 2 of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Abdominal pain compatible with AP&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Serum amylase and/or lipase ≥ 3 times upper limits of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Imaging findings of AP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug induced AP is the assumed diagnosis when no other cause of AP can be found, the patient&#xD;
      is taking a drug known to be associated with AP, and symptoms resolve after drug&#xD;
      discontinuation. If pancreatitis re-occurs on re-exposure, the drug is definitely considered&#xD;
      the cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While drugs are considered a rare cause of AP and most cases are mild and self limited ,&#xD;
      there is an 8 fold higher risk of AP in IBD patients treated with AZA . Thiopurine induced AP&#xD;
      is usually detected within 4 weeks of starting treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However in the case of thiopurine induced AP, there has been no clear understanding of the&#xD;
      mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thiopurine induced AP is generally considered an indication to cease thiopurine therapy, due&#xD;
      to the assumed risk of recurrence of AP on reintroduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There exists several case reports and anecdotal evidence that reintroducing thiopurines&#xD;
      following an assumed thiopurine associated AP can be well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that AZA and/or 6-MP can be safely reintroduced in the&#xD;
      management of IBD patients following thiopurine-induced pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If in the past the patients were treated with AZA, they will now be commenced on 6-MP, and if&#xD;
      in the past they were treated with 6-MP, they will be commenced on AZA.&#xD;

      The research protocol extends for up to 3.5 months, during which the participant will attend&#xD;
      5 clinic visits at Shaare Zedek Medical Centre: screening visit, week 0, week 4, week 8 and&#xD;
      week 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the screening visit, all patients identified who meet the exclusion and inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and who agree to participate in the study, will have their medical records reviewed&#xD;
      for previous clinical or biochemical evidence of pancreatitis, both related, and unrelated to&#xD;
      thiopurine use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo a physical examination, baseline blood tests including measurement of&#xD;
      lipase and/or amylase, liver biochemistry and fasting lipid profile. If not already tested,&#xD;
      the patients TPMT activity will be tested. Participants will also have a baseline abdominal&#xD;
      ultrasound to confirm normal anatomy and absence of cholelithiasis At week 0, if there are no&#xD;
      clinical, biochemicals or ultrasound suggestions of pancreatitis, the participant will be&#xD;
      commenced on an alternative thiopurine from what was used in the past. That is, if in the&#xD;
      past they were treated with AZA, they will now be commenced on 6-MP, and if in the past they&#xD;
      were treated with 6MP, they will be commenced on AZA. The medications will be commenced at&#xD;
      standard dose (ie AZA 2.5mg/kg/day, 6MP 1.5mg/kg/day). Depending on the specific situation,&#xD;
      and assuming all relevant information is available, the screening visit may be merged with&#xD;
      the week 0 visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In weeks 1, 2, 3 and 6 will have blood tests (full blood count and liver biochemistry)&#xD;
      performed at a local clinic, and the investigator will be in telephone contact with the&#xD;
      participant to discuss the results and to discuss if there are any adverse effects of the&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In weeks 4, 8 and 12 the participant will attend clinic with the investigator for a medical&#xD;
      history, clinical examination and review of blood tests (blood count and liver enzymes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event of any new onset upper abdominal pain or emesis, patients will be instructed to&#xD;
      present to their nearest medical facility for blood tests (including serum amylase and/or&#xD;
      lipase) and an ultrasound, if clinically indicated, to contact the investigator and to&#xD;
      consider cessation of the thiopurine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the 3 month period, if patients show no sign of pancreatitis, they will revert&#xD;
      to regular monitoring of thiopurine therapy as per their treating gastroenterologist.&#xD;
