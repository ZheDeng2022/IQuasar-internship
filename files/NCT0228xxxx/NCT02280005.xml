  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, interventional study designed to provide preliminary data on the human&#xD;
      use of the WAK. Up to 10 subjects currently receiving intermittent hemodialysis (HD)&#xD;
      treatment three times per week for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) via an indwelling tunneled&#xD;
      catheter will be studied.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will undergo 24 hours in-hospital treatment with the Wearable Artificial Kidney&#xD;
      (WAK). Up to 10 subjects with ESRD will complete the protocol in its entirety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this protocol is to provide additional preliminary data supporting the&#xD;
      hypothesis that the WAK safely and effectively delivers dialysis therapy that is at least&#xD;
      equal to the current standard of care for treatment of ESRD using conventional machines for&#xD;
      thrice weekly hemodialysis treatments. These objectives would be accomplished by absence of&#xD;
      adverse events during treatment with the WAK, along with effective removal of fluid and&#xD;
      solutes at least equal to those delivered with conventional currently used dialysis machines.&#xD;
      The WAK will be the only investigational device used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reason for this trial is to advance the eventual approval of this device to be legally&#xD;
      commercialized as it potentially may respond to the unmet public health needs to improve&#xD;
      outcomes and reduce costs in the treatment of ESRD patients.&#xD;
