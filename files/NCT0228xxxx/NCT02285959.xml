  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The high-grade malignant brain tumor glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) comprise the majority of&#xD;
      all primary brain tumors in adults. This group of tumors also exhibits the most aggressive&#xD;
      behavior, resulting in median overall survival durations of only 9-12 months for GBM. Initial&#xD;
      therapy consists of surgical resection, external beam radiation or both. Currently, all&#xD;
      patients experience a recurrence after this first-line therapy, so improvements in both&#xD;
      first-line and salvage therapy are critical to enhancing quality-of-life and prolonging&#xD;
      survival. Superselective Intraarterial Cerebral Infusion (SIACI) is a technique that can&#xD;
      effectively increase the concentration of drug delivered to the brain while sparing the body&#xD;
      of systemic side effects. This technique threads a tiny catheter through the patient's&#xD;
      femoral artery in the leg, up through the body and neck and into the brain. Once the catheter&#xD;
      reaches the brain, chemotherapy is released to the blood vessels that feed the tumor.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of GBM&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Grade IV GBM tumors that have recurred after total resection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least four weeks following any recent surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status ≥60% and an expected survival of ≥&#xD;
             three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No IV chemotherapy for three weeks prior to treatment under this research protocol and&#xD;
             no external beam radiation for four weeks prior to treatment under this research&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate hematologic reserve&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-enrollment coagulation parameters (PT and PTT) must be adequate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must agree to use a medically effective method of contraception during and&#xD;
             for a period of three months after the treatment period. A pregnancy test will be&#xD;
             performed on each premenopausal female of childbearing potential immediately prior to&#xD;
             entry into the research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to understand and give written informed consent. Informed&#xD;
             consent must be obtained at the time of patient screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential and fertile men will be informed as to the potential&#xD;
             risk of procreation while participating in this research trial and will be advised&#xD;
             that they must use effective contraception during and for a period of three months&#xD;
             after the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with significant intercurrent medical or psychiatric conditions that would&#xD;
             place them at increased risk or affect their ability to receive or comply with&#xD;
             treatment or post-treatment clinical monitoring.&#xD;
