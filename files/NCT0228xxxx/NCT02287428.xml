    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a new type of vaccine as a possible treatment for patients&#xD;
      with glioblastoma. This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of&#xD;
      an investigational intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the&#xD;
      intervention to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is&#xD;
      being studied and that research doctors are trying to find more about it. It also means that&#xD;
      the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the Personalized NeoAntigen&#xD;
      Cancer Vaccine for any use in patients, including people with glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the initial study cohort (Cohort 1) is to determine if it is possible to make&#xD;
      and administer safely a vaccine against glioblastoma by using information gained from&#xD;
      specific characteristics of the participants tumor. It is known that glioblastomas have&#xD;
      mutations (changes in genetic material) that are specific to an individual patient's tumor.&#xD;
      These mutations can cause the tumor cells to produce proteins that appear very different from&#xD;
      the body's own cells. It is possible that these proteins used in a vaccine may induce strong&#xD;
      immune responses, which may help the body fight any tumor cells that could cause the&#xD;
      glioblastoma to come back in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three additional cohorts (1a, 1b, &amp; 1c) were added to the study following completion of&#xD;
      accrual to the original study cohort (cohort 1). Each new cohort receives NeoVax and&#xD;
      radiation therapy as administered to cohort 1 and will also receive pembrolizumab: cohort 1a&#xD;
      patients will start pembrolizumab w/in 2 weeks after start of RT, and continue every 3 weeks&#xD;
      for up to 2 years; cohort 1b patients will start pembrolizumab 2-4 weeks after completion of&#xD;
      NeoVax priming, and continue every 3 weeks for up to 2 years; cohort 1c patients will receive&#xD;
      a single dose of pembrolizumab administered within 2 weeks after start of RT, re-start 2-4&#xD;
      weeks after completion of NeoVax priming, and continue every 3 weeks for up to 2 years. The&#xD;
      rationale for adding these new cohorts is: 1) to assess the safety and feasibility of NeoVax&#xD;
      when administered with pembrolizumab; and 2) to determine if the timing of anti-PD-1&#xD;
      administration impacts the immunogenicity of NeoVax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional sub-study cohort (1d) is being added for patients whose tumor is&#xD;
      MGMT-methylated. Cohort 1d will enroll patients with tumors for which the MGMT status is&#xD;
      methylated or partially methylated; patients on cohort 1d will receive standard daily&#xD;
      temozolomide during radiation and as adjuvant therapy for up to six cycles following&#xD;
      completion of radiation therapy. The rationale for adding cohort 1d is to determine the&#xD;
      safety and feasibility of NeoVax when administered with pembrolizumab and temozolomide.&#xD;

      It is known that glioblastomas have mutations that are specific to an individual patient's&#xD;
      tumor. These mutations can cause the tumor cells to produce proteins that appear very&#xD;
      different from the body's own cells. It is possible that these proteins used in a vaccine may&#xD;
      induce strong immune responses, which may help the body fight any tumor cells that could&#xD;
      cause glioblastoma to recur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) is a DNA repair protein which can be increased in some&#xD;
      cancers, including glioblastoma. MGMT works to repair the DNA of cancer cells that are&#xD;
      damaged by treatment. If a tumor is found to be &quot;unmethylated&quot;, it means there is more MGMT&#xD;
      present in the tumor than one that is &quot;methylated&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methylation of MGMT is believed to make tumor cells more responsive to drugs like&#xD;
      temozolomide. Studies have shown that temozolomide provides a very small improvement in&#xD;
      outcome for many patients whose glioblastoma is MGMT-unmethylated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with glioblastoma usually receive six weeks of radiation with a daily chemotherapy&#xD;
      called temozolomide after their surgery, followed by six to twelve months of additional&#xD;
      temozolomide. In this study, only participants whose tumors are MGMT-methylated will receive&#xD;
      temozolomide; those participants whose tumors are MGMT-unmethylated will not receive&#xD;
      temozolomide, as studies have shown that temozolomide provides a very small improvement in&#xD;
      outcome for many patients whose glioblastoma is MGMT-unmethylated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On this trial, an initial cohort of participants (Cohort 1) will receive the Personalized&#xD;
      NeoAntigen Vaccine (5 priming doses and 2 booster doses over ~ 20 weeks) after having&#xD;
      completed six weeks of standard radiation. The study will examine the safety of the vaccine&#xD;
      when given at several different time points and will examine the participant blood cells for&#xD;
      signs that the vaccine induced an immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three additional cohorts (1a, 1b, &amp; 1c) were added to the study following completion of&#xD;
      accrual to the original study cohort (cohort 1). Each new cohort receives NeoVax and&#xD;
      radiation therapy as administered to cohort 1 and will also receive pembrolizumab: cohort 1a&#xD;
      patients will start pembrolizumab w/in 2 weeks after start of RT, and continue every 3 weeks&#xD;
      for up to 2 years; cohort 1b patients will start pembrolizumab 2-4 weeks after completion of&#xD;
      NeoVax priming, and continue every 3 weeks for up to 2 years; cohort 1c patients will receive&#xD;
      a single dose of pembrolizumab administered within 2 weeks after start of RT, re-start 2-4&#xD;
      weeks after completion of NeoVax priming, and continue every 3 weeks for up to 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for adding cohorts 1a, 1b and 1c is: 1) to assess the safety and feasibility of&#xD;
      NeoVax when administered with pembrolizumab; and 2) to determine if the timing of anti-PD-1&#xD;
      administration impacts the immunogenicity of NeoVax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional sub-study cohort (1d) is being added for patients whose tumor is&#xD;
      MGMT-methylated. Cohort 1d will enroll patients with tumors for which the MGMT status is&#xD;
      methylated or partially methylated; patients on cohort 1d will receive standard daily&#xD;
      temozolomide during radiation and as adjuvant therapy for up to six cycles following&#xD;
      completion of radiation therapy. The rationale for adding cohort 1d is to determine the&#xD;
      safety and feasibility of NeoVax when administered with pembrolizumab and temozolomide.&#xD;

             sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent of HCG) before entry onto the trial, because the&#xD;

             vitiligo, type 1 diabetes, residual autoimmune-related hypothyroidism requiring&#xD;
             hormone replacement, or psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment. Replacement&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Planned major surgery;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because personalized neoantigen peptides&#xD;
             and poly-ICLC are agents with unknown risks to the developing fetus. Because there is&#xD;
             an unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with personalized neoantigen peptides and poly-ICLC, nursing&#xD;
             women are excluded from this study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with a history of an invasive malignancy are ineligible except for the&#xD;
             following circumstances; a) individuals with a history of invasive malignancy are&#xD;

             trial evaluating interventions for purposes other than GBM therapy is not a basis for&#xD;
             exclusion, and may be permitted pending prospective approval of Principal Investigator&#xD;
             or designee.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to study&#xD;
