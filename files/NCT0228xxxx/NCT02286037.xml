      Assessments of mechanical skin sensitivity include psychophysical responses to stimulation&#xD;
      with calibrated polyamide monofilaments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the applications of polyamide monofilaments are the assessments of magnitude of&#xD;
      secondary hyperalgesia areas (SHAs), i.e. areas in normal skin near an injury with increased&#xD;
      mechanical sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to investigate the hypothesis, based on previous studies, that&#xD;
      a light tactile stimulus delineates a larger SHA than stimulation with a more rigid&#xD;
      monofilament.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-three healthy participants were included in this randomized, two-observer, test-retest&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A highly significant positive correlation between the bending force of the polyamide&#xD;
      filaments and the magnitude of SHA was demonstrated. The &quot;weighted-pin&quot; instrument showed&#xD;
      significantly and consistently larger areas than the polyamide monofilaments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis was rejected: a light tactile stimulus did not delineate a larger secondary&#xD;
      hyperalgesia area than stimulation with a more rigid monofilament. The &quot;weighted-pin&quot;&#xD;
      instrument seems an alternative to the conventional polyamide monofilaments.&#xD;

      Introduction Assessments of mechanical skin sensitivity include psychophysical responses to&#xD;
      stimulation with calibrated polyamide monofilaments. Although the theoretical background and&#xD;
      the application of monofilaments are straightforward, inconsistencies of the method have been&#xD;
      reported in the literature. One of the applications of polyamide monofilaments are the&#xD;
      assessments of magnitude of secondary hyperalgesia areas (SHAs), i.e. areas in normal skin&#xD;
      near an injury with increased mechanical sensitivity. Secondary hyperalgesia is a measure of&#xD;
      central sensitization and reflects the effect of an injury on the central nervous system. The&#xD;
      objective of the study is to investigate the hypothesis, based on previous studies, that a&#xD;
      light tactile stimulus delineates a larger SHA than stimulation with a more rigid&#xD;
      monofilament.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method Twenty-three healthy participants were included in this randomized, two-observer,&#xD;
      test-retest study. The volunteers were blinded to the test-results. The design was adjusted&#xD;
      to examine intra-/inter-observer and intra-/inter-day variability in SHAs after a first&#xD;
      degree burn injury was induced by a contact thermode (47ºC, 7 minutes, thermode area 12.5&#xD;
      cm2) on the lower leg. The SHAs were assessed 45 to 75 min (15 min for each observer) after&#xD;
      the burn injury and delineated by 3 different polyamide monofilaments (50, 299, 986 mN) and a&#xD;
      &quot;weighted-pin&quot; instrument (512 mN). The testing order of the monofilaments was randomized,&#xD;
      and the observers were blinded to the study results of each other. The examination order of&#xD;
      the observers on Day 1 was reversed on Day 2 (&gt; 6 weeks later).&#xD;
