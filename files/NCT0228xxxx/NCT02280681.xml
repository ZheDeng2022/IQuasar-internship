    <textblock>
      Introduction 3-17% of heterosexual couples trying to conceive will be faced with fertility&#xD;
      problems (Boivin et al, 2007). Of these couples 50% will be confronted with a female factor,&#xD;
      which includes amongst others ovarian failure (WHO, 2000). Ovarian failure can occur&#xD;
      pre-maturely (i.e. before the age of 40 years old, in 1% of women; Coulam, 1982; Coulam et&#xD;
      al., 1986) or at a physiologically natural age of after 40 years but before reaching the&#xD;
      limit of 44 years old at which modern women that still want children can rely on reimbursed&#xD;
      medical assisted reproduction (MAR) in European countries, such as Belgium and the&#xD;
      Netherlands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although some couples with ovarian failure will have attempted MAR without success, they will&#xD;
      be left with IVF with donor ooyctes or embryo reception as only treatment option. These&#xD;
      treatment options will not result in genetic parenthood for one or both of the partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers are currently developing new forms of MAR that do not require patients to have&#xD;
      functional gametes but rely on artificial gametes (AGs) developed by means of different&#xD;
      techniques (Hendriks et al, submitted).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reproductive medicine experts are starting to reflect on the need for minimal thresholds of&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety to introduce these and other new forms of MAR into clinical practice&#xD;
      (Harper et al, 2012; Schatten, 2002; Winston &amp; Hardy, 2002). Research, however, showed that&#xD;
      specific subgroups of infertile patients value other treatment characteristics besides safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness, such as, for example, naturalness (Hendriks et al, 2014; De Groot et al,&#xD;
      submitted; Lankreijer et al, in preparation). The perspectives of couples with ovarian&#xD;
      failure on MAR with AGs has yet to be explored. Clinicians' perspectives on MAR with AGs -&#xD;
      valuable because of their expertise and their direct involvement in possible future&#xD;
      decision-making - has not been studied. A previous study showed that clinicians differ from&#xD;
      patients in their evaluation of the importance of characteristics of fertility clinics (van&#xD;
      Empel et al, 2011) and would be interesting to compare the perspective of patients and&#xD;
      clinicians on MAR with AGs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective The aim is to gain insight into characteristics of MAR with AGs valued by couples&#xD;
      confronted with ovarian failure and their physicians and the trade-offs they make between&#xD;
      these treatment characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology The treatment characteristics valued by patients are identified by literature&#xD;
      review. Treatment characteristics valued by clinicians will be identified by preparatory&#xD;
      qualitative research. The (relative) importance of these treatment characteristics will be&#xD;
      examined with a discrete choice experiments analysed with multinomial logistic regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will be heterosexual couples confronted with infertility due to ovarian&#xD;
      failure between the age of 18 and 44 years old treated in the K.U.Leuven and clinicians who&#xD;
      indicated an interest in reproductive medicine in their membership of the Belgian Society for&#xD;
      Reproductive Medicine (BSRM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the preparatory qualitative study and discrete choice experiment questionnaire will be&#xD;
      preceded by giving written information supported by figures on MAR with AGs (i.e. referred to&#xD;
      in the rest of the protocol as 'preceding information on MAR with AGs') which will be pilot&#xD;
      tested. This preceding information on MAR with AGs will define MAR with AG and will be&#xD;
      exemplified by explaining the possible techniques to create AG and conceive a child (appendix&#xD;
      3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preparatory qualitative study Physicians treating heterosexual couples confronted with&#xD;
      infertility due to ovarian failure will be selected from the professional network of the&#xD;
      authors, resulting in a convenience sample. Clinicians will be interviewed at their clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All interviews will be conducted by a female interviewer (SH) who is familiar with all&#xD;
      aspects of the treatment options but not involved in patient care. The interview will start&#xD;
      with the preceding information on MAR with AGs'. The in-depth interviews will take 30-60 min&#xD;
      and will be guided by a semi-structured interview guide and a topic list developed based on&#xD;
      the literature on the biology of AG (Hendriks et al, submitted), on the consequences of the&#xD;
      clinical application of AGs (Hendriks et al, submitted), and previous qualitative and&#xD;
      quantitative research on the importance of treatment characteristics for patients (Hendriks&#xD;
      et al., 2013; Lankrijker et al, in preperation; Hendriks et al, in preperation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews will be recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed with content analysis by two&#xD;
      researchers independently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As appropriate for qualitative research, the number of interviews per group (i.e. couples and&#xD;
      physicians) will be deÔ¨Åned by the achievement of data saturation per group (i.e. when a sense&#xD;
      of closure is achieved because no new themes answering the research question emerged in three&#xD;
      successive interviews; Francis et al., 2010; Pope et al., 2000; Tong et al., 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Discrete choice experiment (DCE) A discrete choice experiment questionnaire (DCE-Q)&#xD;
      will be designed based on the results of the preparatory qualitative study, incorporating all&#xD;
      identified valued treatment characteristics. A DCE aims to identify attributes (in this case&#xD;
      treatment characteristics) significantly affecting choice and trade-offs of all attributes&#xD;
      with one attribute generally considered the most important (in this case, either pregnancy&#xD;
      rate or safety (Dancet et al., 2013), depending on the insights gathered by the qualitative&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A discrete choice experiment (DCE) is the best available method to investigate the relative&#xD;
      importance of characteristics of multi-dimensional concepts (e.g. quality of care,&#xD;
      characteristics of fertility treatments) and allows the calculation of respondents trade-offs&#xD;
      between characteristics (Ryan and Farrar, 2000; Bryan and Parry, 2001; Sculpher et al., 2004;&#xD;
      Telser and Zweifel, 2007; Albada and Triemstra, 2009). In a DCE, respondents have to choose&#xD;
      repeatedly between choice sets, each described by characteristics with varying levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this DCE-Q respondents will be asked to choose between choice sets developed to represent&#xD;
      the hypothetical but realistic fertility treatments based on AGs. The fertility treatments&#xD;
      will be described by a number attributes that can each vary across a number of levels (e.g.&#xD;
      pregnancy rate varying between 20% and 35%). The attributes will be the valued treatment&#xD;
      characteristics identified by the preparatory qualitative study in couples and physicians.&#xD;
      The levels over which the attributes can vary in the description of the hypothetical&#xD;
      fertility treatments will reflect a range realistic for current MAR and future MAR with AGs&#xD;
      (Hendriks et al, submitted).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mathematical model (i.e. a fractional factorial design, which is both orthogonal and&#xD;
      balanced, created according to published principles; Street and Burgess, 2007) will define&#xD;
      how many of all combinations of attributes and levels will be questioned. To realize 'choice&#xD;
      sets' (i.e. define to which hypothetical fertility treatment to compare each selected&#xD;
      combination) with maximum differentiation between the compared hypothetical fertility&#xD;
      treatments, a fold-over technique will be applied to result in 'mirror' scenarios. We will&#xD;
      make sure that the efficiency of the final design, calculated according to Street and Burgess&#xD;
      (2010b), will ensure 100% informative value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will make sure that maximal 17 choice sets (Sculpher et al., 2004; Christofides et al.,&#xD;
      2006; Bech et al., 2010) are presented in each questionnaire, if necessary choice sets will&#xD;
      be divided over different questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four DCE-Q questionnaire addenda will be developed in addition to the preceding information&#xD;
      on MAR with AGs. First, to clarify the DCE method, the DCE-Q will be preceded by detailed&#xD;
      instructions. Couples and physicians will be explained that from each choice set they need to&#xD;
      select the hypothetical fertility treatment which they prefer. An example choice set, where&#xD;
      respondents have to select their preferred airline ticket for a holiday will be exemplifying.&#xD;
      Second, a form to collect demographic characteristics and professional characteristics or&#xD;
      medical characteristics, for physicians or couples, respectively will be developed. Third, to&#xD;
      test the face-validity of the modelled treatment characteristics, respondents will be asked&#xD;
      for any additional treatment characteristics on which they would have liked to be informed to&#xD;
      choose between fertility treatments. Fourth and only applicable to couples, not to&#xD;
      physicians, couples' actual past choice behaviour will be examined by asking them which&#xD;
      fertility treatments they have opted for, and for which reasons they decided for or against&#xD;
      the offered treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DCE-Q and its addenda will be distributed by post. With regards to couples, all couples&#xD;
      of which the woman was diagnosed with ovarian failure between October 2009 and October 2014&#xD;
      at the K.U.Leuven will be addressed. With regards to physicians, all physicians who indicated&#xD;
      an interest in reproductive medicine in their membership of the Belgian Society for&#xD;
      Reproductive Medicine (BSRM) will be addressed. Couples will be requested to fill out the&#xD;
      questionnaire addenda together and to each fill out the DCE-Q separately. Physicians will be&#xD;
      requested to fill out the questionnaire individually. The questionnaire will be coded, so&#xD;
      that respondents who do not reply either by filling out the questionnaire or the statement of&#xD;
      non-participation, can be send a maximum of two reminders. Prior to filling out the&#xD;
      questionnaire respondents will be informed on the purpose of the study and provided with&#xD;
      contact information. This way participation results in giving informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data of incoming questionnaires will be entered in the Statistical Package for the Social&#xD;
      Sciences (SPSS; version 21.0 for Mac, Chicago, IL, USA). For analysis of the DCE-Q the data&#xD;
      will be exported to the STATA Software (version 11.1.). Data from couples and physicians will&#xD;
      be analysed separately. P-values of &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data gathered from the DCE-Q addenda will be described with descriptive analyses (e.g.&#xD;
      demographic characteristics) or content analysis (e.g. question on missed treatment&#xD;
      characteristics).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data gathered with the DCE-Q will be analyzed with multinomial logistic regression. For&#xD;
      each treatment characteristic, analyses will examine whether it contributes significantly to&#xD;
      respondents preference. Trade-offs that respondents are willing to make between pregnancy&#xD;
      rate and any other attribute (i.e. the willingness to trade-off pregnancy rate; WTpreg) will&#xD;
      be calculated as pregnancy rate is considered the 'gold standard' to benchmark the other&#xD;
      fertility treatment characteristics (van Empel et al, 2011). Confidence intervals (95%) for&#xD;
      the WTpreg were computed using a non-parametric bootstrap approach (2000 replications).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate heterogeneity in preferences between subgroups of couples or physicians, we&#xD;
      will included interaction terms in the model (i.e. confounders' tests). Furthermore, the&#xD;
      results of the analysis of the data of the couples will be compared with the results of the&#xD;
      analysis of the data of the physicians.&#xD;
