      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of an amino acid moisturizing cream and&#xD;
      desonide cream in reducing skin symptoms associated with AD/eczema in subjects with mild to&#xD;
      moderate atopic dermatitis/eczema.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized study comparing the effects of an amino acid moisturizing&#xD;
      cream and desonide cream in reducing skin symptoms associated with AD/eczema in subjects with&#xD;
      mild to moderate atopic dermatitis/eczema. Atopic dermatitis (AD), also known as Eczema, is a&#xD;
      chronic inflammatory skin disease that most commonly affects infants and children with a&#xD;
      prevalence of 10-20% in children as compared to 1-3% in adults. Patients with AD have dry,&#xD;
      irritated skin and often experience severe pruritus. Treatment of AD involves avoidance of&#xD;
      triggers and infectious agents, cutaneous hydration, control of pruritus, and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory agents. Topical calcineurin inhibitors and steroids are commonly used&#xD;
      prescription anti-inflammatory treatments. Unfortunately, there are potential side effects of&#xD;
      long-term topical glucocorticoid use including skin atrophy, development of striae, perioral&#xD;
      dermatitis, acne, and even hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression. However, many&#xD;
      moisturizers are available without a prescription to soothe skin and reduce symptoms&#xD;
      associated with AD/eczema via increased hydration, improved barrier function and&#xD;
      anti-irritancy effects. The study cream being compared to desonide is a cosmetic moisturizing&#xD;
      formulation that contains a cosmetic amino acid dipeptide (e.g., contains 2 amino acids).&#xD;
      This study is being conducted to understand the benefits of the amino acid dipeptide&#xD;
      moisturizing cream versus dermatologist-prescribed desonide cream in reducing the symptoms&#xD;
      associated with AD/eczema in order to evaluate its potential use in the eczema care market.&#xD;
      For this study, approximately 60 males and females, 18 years of age and older, who are in&#xD;
      general good health, but diagnosed with mild to moderate AD/eczema, will be recruited,&#xD;
      screened, and fully consented, with the goal of enrolling up to 42 evaluable subjects. The 42&#xD;
      Subjects (21 subjects per group) will be randomly and equally assigned to either one of 2&#xD;
      treatment groups of amino acid moisturizing cream or desonide cream. Neither study subjects&#xD;
      nor study staff will be aware of the treatment assigned. The subjects will be asked to&#xD;
      participate for approximately 5 weeks, over 5 study visits: Screening/Baseline, Weeks 1-3&#xD;
      (Treatment Period), Regression weeks 4 &amp; 5. Each subject will receive one, 15 gram, blinded&#xD;
      study cream at each treatment visit to apply twice daily at home for 3 weeks; a 2-week&#xD;
      regression phase of no study cream will follow the treatment phase. A predetermined target&#xD;
      lesion will be assessed at each time point via established clinical grading scales including:&#xD;
      Target lesion Atopic Dermatitis Severity Index (TADSI), Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI),&#xD;
      Static IGA of targeted lesion, Total IGA (PGA) and Body Surface Area involvement. All grading&#xD;
      will be completed by the principal or sub-investigators. Photographs will also be taken at&#xD;
      each time point to assess changes during the treatment and regression phases. Other&#xD;
      established scales will be utilized to collect patient perception of skin effects such as:&#xD;
      Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM), subjects' assessment of pruritus (VAS); a&#xD;
      self-assessment questionnaire will be utilized to collect information on perceived benefits&#xD;
      and product aesthetics. This study has been IRB approved and is scheduled to begin November&#xD;
      of 2014 at Massachusetts General Hospital, specifically at the Clinical Unit for Research&#xD;
      Trials in Skin (CURTIS) under principal investigator, Alexandra B. Kimball, MD. The study is&#xD;
      being sponsored by NeoStrata Company, Inc, Princeton, NJ.&#xD;
