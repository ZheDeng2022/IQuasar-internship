  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project aims to develop novel electrochemotherapeutic treatment of glioblastoma&#xD;
      multiforme (GBM). Standard treatment has limited effect on survival and quality of life.&#xD;
      Electrochemotherapy is a novel and promising treatment, which has demonstrated convincing&#xD;
      results in the treatment of various types of carcinoma. The treatment is based on a&#xD;
      combination of electrical current stimulation of tumor cells and simultaneous administration&#xD;
      of chemotherapeutic drugs. Electrochemotherapy works by inducing an electrical current&#xD;
      between implanted electrodes in the tumor tissue, causing electroporation of the cancer cell&#xD;
      membranes, and thereby increasing the cellular permeability and drug uptake.&#xD;
      Electrochemotherapy has proven to be an efficient way of considerably increasing the potency&#xD;
      of the chemotherapeutic drug bleomycin in malignant cells in skin tumors and carcinoma&#xD;
      metastases, and thereby increasing cytotoxicity of the drug locally in the tumor tissue. This&#xD;
      allows for treatment with lower doses of chemotherapeutic drugs and more defined, local area&#xD;
      of effect, thus decreasing systemic effects. The investigators propose to use a novel&#xD;
      non-invasive and safe technique called focused transcranial magnetic stimulation (focused&#xD;
      TMS) to induce electrical current in the tumor tissue. TMS is a safe and widely implemented&#xD;
      technology used to treat multiple neurological diseases such as pain, depression and stroke.&#xD;
      Studies have shown that effective electroporation of cell membranes can be obtained using&#xD;
      induction of electromagnetic fields in a cell suspension, and new focused TMS further enables&#xD;
      focused treatment of selected brain regions without surgical intervention and, thereby&#xD;
      focusing chemotherapeutic treatment to pathological tissue and avoiding surgery related brain&#xD;
      tissue damage. Additionally, TMS transiently increases blood-brain barrier permeability,&#xD;
      theoretically allowing increased uptake of chemotherapeutic drugs in the target area. This&#xD;
      addresses a significant challenge in the treatment of brain cancer, as most cytotoxic drugs&#xD;
      have fairly limited ability to pass the blood brain barrier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intention of this research project is to investigate the therapeutic potential of focused&#xD;
      TMS as an alternative non-invasive source of current induction and thereby means to treat&#xD;
      several types of brain cancer with electrochemotherapy.&#xD;
