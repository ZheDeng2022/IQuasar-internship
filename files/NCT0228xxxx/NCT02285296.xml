      Elderly cancer patients need more help from their relatives and for longer than young adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis of research is that the needs and resources to help the couple &quot; elderly&#xD;
      patient/caregiver &quot;, are at least in part socially determined and that the implementation of&#xD;
      a personalized support plan to help the caregiver (PSP) taking into account needs, resources&#xD;
      and expectations of the primary caregiver in addition to those of elderly patients with&#xD;
      cancer may partly correct inequalities. The PSP should allow a better management of cancer, a&#xD;
      lesser burden for the caregiver and a better quality of life for both the caregiver and the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;

      Scientific context Elderly cancer patients need more help from their relatives and for longer&#xD;
      than young adults. The person who takes primary responsibility for someone who cannot care&#xD;
      fully for themselves is called the primary caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent personal study concerning elderly cancer patients caregivers show that most&#xD;
      caregivers reported high or moderate levels of psychological distress, with an impact on&#xD;
      their own health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, family caregivers often report deficits in information about the disease, in&#xD;
      training and skills related to their patients' care, and a lack of assistance from healthcare&#xD;
      professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability of the primary caregiver to meet the medical, material and emotional needs of the&#xD;
      patient depends on their own resources (psychological, physical, intellectual, physical,&#xD;
      financial) and on the diversity of their social network, but it also depends on the quality&#xD;
      of the personalized support program (including information and training) that has been&#xD;
      established for them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis of research is that the needs and resources to help the couple &quot; elderly&#xD;
      patient/caregiver &quot;, are at least in part socially determined and that the implementation of&#xD;
      a personalized support plan to help the caregiver (PSP) taking into account needs, resources&#xD;
      and expectations of the primary caregiver in addition to those of elderly patients with&#xD;
      cancer may partly correct inequalities. The PSP should allow a better management of cancer, a&#xD;
      lesser burden for the caregiver and a better quality of life for both the caregiver and the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention description&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, interventional, randomized trial, with 118 patients in each group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an experimental interventional arm including an interview of the primary caregivers to&#xD;
           identify their needs and expectations, the implementation of a &quot;personalized support&#xD;
           program&quot;, including telephone follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A control arm corresponding to the standard care. Caregiver aid is usually proposed when&#xD;
           accompanying a sick relative in consultation or hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the &quot;couples patient / caregiver' will benefit initially from:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a comprehensive geriatric assessment (elderly patients with cancer)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. an assessment of caregiver burden by the Zarit burden interview (ZBI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. an assessment of subjective well-being&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. an individual assessment of the precariousness and health inequalities based on the&#xD;
           score EPICES (Evaluation of precariousness and health inequalities in the health&#xD;
           Centers)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified according to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  living in the same household or not&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  score of initial Zarit Burden Interview&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Stage 1: A semi-structured interview centered on the caregiver's needs (COAT&#xD;
      tool) Stage 2: guided questionnaires to assess the psychosocial situation of caregivers Stage&#xD;
      3: implementation of a multi-component PSP (information, counseling, listening time, training&#xD;
      to help overcome their difficulties as a caregiver, planning for future care) Stage 4: at&#xD;
      least one monthly phone interview Stage 5: 6 months follow up on the psychosocial&#xD;
      characteristics of caregivers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results in public health Our study will help to better define the way to take better&#xD;
      account of the needs of the helper / helped couple, and reinforce the role of the&#xD;
      coordinating nurse in the care pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If our hypotheses can confirmed that there is a link between the caregivers needs and the&#xD;
      social determinants of health and that the intervention has a positive impact on the&#xD;
      caregivers burden and stress, it will suggest that this intervention not only acts favorably&#xD;
      on social inequalities in health, but it can help reduce health care costs, as the caregiver&#xD;
      exhaustion increases the risk of health expenditure (drug consumption, hospitalization of the&#xD;
      patient and of the caregiver).&#xD;
