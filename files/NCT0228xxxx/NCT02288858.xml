    <textblock>
      The purpose of this multi-site, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study, conducted&#xD;
      for Lifes2Good, is to evaluate certain physiological effects of Viviscal Oral Supplement&#xD;
      compared to a placebo in female subjects with self-perceived thinning hair associated with&#xD;
      poor diet, stress, hormonal influences, or abnormal menstrual cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Viviscal is an oral food supplement specifically designed to promote the quality of existing&#xD;
      hair growth and/or to promote new hair re-growth for women suffering from temporary thinning&#xD;
      hair. It does not contain hormones, drugs, or industry by-products. Viviscal has been&#xD;
      marketed in Europe for over 15 years. The key ingredient is AminoMar C - a protein rich&#xD;
      compound of marine extracts blended with soluble silica and fortified with Vitamin C.&#xD;
      Viviscal provides essential nutrients to nourish hair naturally from within. Viviscal works&#xD;
      over several months of use to improve the appearance of thinning hair.&#xD;

      The purpose of this multi-site, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study, conducted&#xD;
      for Lifes2Good, is to evaluate certain physiological effects of Viviscal Oral Supplement&#xD;
      compared to a placebo in female subjects with self-perceived thinning hair associated with&#xD;
      poor diet, stress, hormonal influences, or abnormal menstrual cycles. A total of 72 female&#xD;
      subjects (36 subjects at the Dallas Research Center and 36 subjects at the Colorado Research&#xD;
      Center) completed the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At day 0, prior to clinical procedures, subjects were assigned to 1 of the 2 treatment&#xD;
      groups, Viviscal Oral Supplement or Placebo Tablets, based on the completely randomized study&#xD;
      design that was generated with no input of subject information and conditions. During the&#xD;
      course of the study, subjects consumed 1 tablet (512 mg) 3 times per day of the assigned test&#xD;
      material, Viviscal Oral Supplement or Placebo Tablets, with water after food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical evaluations were conducted at visit 1 (day 0), visit 2 (day 2), visit 3 (3 months ±&#xD;
      2 weeks), visit 4 (2 days after visit 3), visit 5 (6 months ± 2 weeks), and visit 6 (2 days&#xD;
      after visit 5). Subjects participated in the following procedures at the indicated time&#xD;
      points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scalp Examination At day 0, each subject's scalp was examined by the Sub-Investigator to&#xD;
           rule out any confounding scalp conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical Examination A qualified nurse/nurse practitioner performed a basic physical&#xD;
           examination of each subject at day 0, 3 months±2 weeks, and 6 months±2 weeks. The&#xD;
           physical examination included a basic body systems overview, vital signs (blood pressure&#xD;
           and pulse), respiration rate, temperature, weight, and height. Additionally, at the&#xD;
           Colorado Research Center, the Sub-Investigator and qualified nurse practitioner examined&#xD;
           each subject's scalp.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test Site Selection and Preparation At day 0, the examining Sub-Investigator selected a&#xD;
           target area on each subject's scalp. To prepare the target areas for digital&#xD;
           photography, subjects underwent shaving of the target areas at day 0, 3 months±2 weeks,&#xD;
           and 6 months±2 weeks. Hair dyeing of the target areas was performed at day 0 and (if&#xD;
           fading had occurred) at day 2, 3 months±2 weeks, 2 days after visit 3, 6 months±2 weeks,&#xD;
           and 2 days after visit 5. Subjects underwent demarcation of the target areas with a&#xD;
           small black dot tattoo at day 0 and (if fading had occurred) at 3 months±2 weeks and 6&#xD;
           months±2 weeks. For post-day 0 time points, tattooing procedures (if needed) were&#xD;
           performed after the photography procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Digital Photography Macro photographs were captured of each subject's target area&#xD;
           selected by the Sub-Investigator at all study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Shed Hair Collection Procedures At day 2, 2 days after visit 3, 2 days after visit 5, a&#xD;
           clinician shampooed each subject's hair in a normal washing manner over a sink with&#xD;
           securely fastened cheesecloth positioned to catch any hairs that were shed from the&#xD;
           scalp. A clinician gently combed through the hair and rinsed any shed hairs from the&#xD;
           comb onto the cheesecloth. Shed hairs found in the cheesecloth were counted and&#xD;
           recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire Each subject completed a quality of life questionnaire at baseline (day&#xD;
           0), 2 days after visit 3 and 2 days after visit 5 and a consumer questionnaire at 2 days&#xD;
           after visit 3 and 2 days after visit 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily Diary During the course of the study, subjects completed a daily diary to record&#xD;
           product application times, any comments, and responses to a weekly question regarding&#xD;
           their hair loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interviews At day 0, a portion of the subjects (at the Dallas Research Center) was&#xD;
           selected to be interviewed and filmed. Film interviews were conducted for the&#xD;
           pre-selected subjects at day 2 and 2 days after visit 5.&#xD;
