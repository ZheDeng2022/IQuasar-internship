  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a Phase 1 study in adolescents with ADHD and genetic disruptions impacting&#xD;
      genes in the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) network. The objectives of the study are&#xD;
      to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics following single-dose, oral&#xD;
      administration of NFC-1 and to evaluate safety and tolerability and to obtain evidence for&#xD;
      the effect of NFC-1 on ADHD severity and global functioning during and following four weeks&#xD;
      of continuous treatment. Exploratory analyses will be performed to assess effect size of&#xD;
      specific mGluR-network genes on ADHD based on responsiveness of patients to NFC-1. This study&#xD;
      will be conducted at a single clinical site, the Jefferson University Hospital PKU&#xD;
      (Philadelphia, PA).&#xD;
