  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A phase I study to evaluate safety of gemcitabine with nab-paclitaxel and concurrent IMRT for&#xD;
      locally advanced and borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. The goal of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate if a chemotherapy regimen that provides superior systemic efficacy may be safely&#xD;
      delivered and enhance efficacy of tumor directed radiation therapy.&#xD;

In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.

    <description>Prior to initiation of chemoradiation, patients will undergo 1 full cycle of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle.&#xD;
Both gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel will be given intravenously on an outpatient basis during the one-month lead-in period and during Weeks 1 and 2 (and, if enrolled to Dose Level or 2, Weeks 4 and 5) of radiotherapy. There may be up to 21 days between the last dose of lead-in chemotherapy (given on Day 15) and initiation of chemoradiation (inclusive of the week following Day 15, the fourth week of the lead-in cycle (an off-week), and an additional week following that).&#xD;
Intensity modulated radiation (IMRT) - the prescribed dose will range from 40-67.5 Gy over 15 to 25 fractions.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the&#xD;
             pancreas that is considered unresectable or borderline resectable based on&#xD;
             institutional standardized criteria of unresectability or medical inoperability.&#xD;
             Patients with and without regional adenopathy are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior systemic chemotherapy allowed. It is anticipated and suggested that most&#xD;
             patients enrolled on study will have received a minimum of approximately 2 months of&#xD;
             systemic therapy according to routine institutional practices. The patient must also&#xD;
             be felt by the treating medical oncologist and radiation oncologist to be a candidate&#xD;
             for treatment with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 18 years of age.&#xD;

             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Distant metastatic disease, including known brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of prior malignancy is acceptable, but prior radiotherapy to the region of the&#xD;
             study cancer that would result in overlap of radiation therapy fields is not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to first study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or&#xD;
             biologic composition to gemcitabine or nab-paclitaxel or other agents used in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Patient must have a negative pregnancy test within 14&#xD;
             days of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known HIV-positivity on combination antiretroviral therapy because of the potential&#xD;
             for pharmacokinetic interactions with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. In addition,&#xD;
             these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients&#xD;
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
