  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The vast majority of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients present with elevated blood&#xD;
      pressure(BP). Management of BP is controversial with two competing rationales. There is some&#xD;
      evidence that hyperacute treatment may improve outcomes by reducing the rate of hematoma&#xD;
      expansion. Physicians have been reluctant to reduce BP early after ICH onset, fearing reduced&#xD;
      cerebral blood flow (CBF) will increase ischemia and increase the risk of further damage.&#xD;
      Other confounding mediators to further ischemic injury following ICH include increased&#xD;
      platelet activity, withdrawal of antithrombotic therapy, endothelial dysfunction,&#xD;
      inflammation and hypercoagulability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is phase II of the ICH-ADAPT study. The investigators hypothesize that aggressive&#xD;
      antihypertensive therapy will alter the natural history of heamatoma growth, improving&#xD;
      outcomes after Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH). The previous phase I ICH-ADAPT study has&#xD;
      established the safety of early BP treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have designed a phase II study in which ICH patients are randomized to&#xD;
      aggressive versus conservative BP treatment using a deferred consent procedure. An adaptive&#xD;
      randomization will be used to treat BP to &lt; 140 mmHg SBP or &lt; 180 mmHg SBP. Treatment must be&#xD;
      implemented as soon as possible after radiological confirmation of diagnosis.&#xD;
      Antihypertensive therapy must begin within 6 hours of symptom onset. The patient will be&#xD;
      re-imaged 24 hours later. The patient will have continuous non-invasive BP and heart rate(HR)&#xD;
      monitoring for a minimum of 24 hours. Antihypertensive drug use and dosage will be recorded&#xD;
      with BP and HR. Patients will be monitored regularly until study completion. MRI's will be&#xD;
      done at 48 hours, day 7 and day 30. This imaging will help to detect ischemic changes that&#xD;
      may occur. Blood will be collected at the same time as the MRI. Blood analysis will be done&#xD;
      to possibly identify biomarkers that may be putative mediators of ischemic injury in ICH&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      Study Design: multi-centre randomized open-label, blinded-endpoint trial of two different BP&#xD;
      management strategies. This study is being conducted in the Emergency Departments and Stroke&#xD;
      Units of Canadian academic and non-academic centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall Aim and Hypothesis: The primary study aim is to assess the rate of ischemic lesion&#xD;
      development in patients randomized to two different BP treatment strategies. The overall a&#xD;
      priori hypothesis is that aggressive BP reduction will not be associated with ischemic injury&#xD;
      after ICH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: Male and female patients will be recruited from Emergency Departments of&#xD;
      participating hospitals. A total of 270 patients will be included over 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Data and Randomization: Demographics, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and National&#xD;
      Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores (both of which are part of routine stroke&#xD;
      patient assessment), time of symptom onset and diagnostic CT scan will all be recorded. If&#xD;
      the CT scan is completed within 6 hours of onset and confirms evidence of a primary ICH,&#xD;
      patients will be randomized. Where patients are incompetent and surrogate decision makers are&#xD;
      not immediately available, randomization will occur using a deferred consent procedure.&#xD;
      Stroke risk factors, past medical history and medications, with emphasis on&#xD;
      antihypertensives, as well as standard clinical blood work (complete blood count and&#xD;
      coagulation profile) will be recorded after randomization in order to avoid delays to BP&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention - Blood Pressure Management Protocols:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Aggressive&quot; BP Target (&lt;140 mmHg) Treatment Group: Patients randomized to the &lt;140 mmHg&#xD;
      group (n=135) will immediately receive a 10 mg IV bolus of labetalol, administered over 1&#xD;
      minute. A protocol designed to achieve and maintain systolic BP &lt;140 mmHg within 60 minutes&#xD;
      of randomization has been designed (Appendix 5). A key feature of this protocol is the&#xD;
      utilization of IV enalapril, which can be given regularly (Q. 6 hourly), avoiding BP&#xD;
      fluctuations, a problem which has been noted previously when using bolus-based protocols.109&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the &lt;140 mmHg group will be treated with 1.25 mg of IV enalapril&#xD;
      immediately after labetalol administration. A lower limit of 120 mmHg has been stipulated,&#xD;
      although given the investigators experience in ICH ADAPT I, this is unlikely to be achieved.&#xD;
      In the event of systolic BP falling below 120 mmHg, antihypertensive therapy will be held and&#xD;
      patients will be fluid resuscitated with isotonic saline. Pressor agents will not be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Conservative&quot; BP Target (&lt;180 mmHg) Treatment Group: Patients randomized to the &lt;180 mmHg&#xD;
      group (n=135) will be administered parenteral antihypertensive therapy only if systolic BP is&#xD;
      ≥180 mmHg, consistent with current guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have continuous non-invasive BP and heart rate (HR) monitoring for a&#xD;
      minimum of 24h. BP and HR will be recorded most intensively during the hyperacute phase, as&#xD;
      per the NINDS r-tPA protocol for vital signs monitoring. Antihypertensive drug use and&#xD;
      dosages will be recorded concomitantly with BP and HR. Patients will be monitored regularly&#xD;
      until study completion. Door-to-needle times will be documented with respect to the&#xD;
      initiation of antihypertensive medication and the proportion of patients achieving BP targets&#xD;
      within 1 hour of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At completion of the 24h active treatment period, all patients will continue to receive&#xD;
      standard stroke care and rehabilitation, and treating physicians will manage BP in the manner&#xD;
      they feel is appropriate. Physicians will be encouraged to start oral antihypertensive&#xD;
      therapy, administered via nasogastric feeding tube if necessary, on day 2. BP, HR and&#xD;
      antihypertensive medication doses will continue to be monitored and recorded every 4 h for&#xD;
      the first 48 h and then twice daily until discharge. Long-term goals for both patient groups&#xD;
      after the active treatment period are a systolic BP of &lt;140 mmHg, or &lt;130 mmHg in those with&#xD;
      diabetes, as per current stroke prevention and hypertension guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline - Immediately prior to randomization and BP reduction, patients will undergo a&#xD;
      standard non-contrast CT diagnostic brain scan. In the event of early neurological&#xD;
      deterioration at any point, a repeat CT scan will be obtained immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      24 hour CT - All patients will have a repeat CT brain scan at 24±3 h, in order to assess for&#xD;
      hematoma expansion and peri-hematoma edema volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      48 hour MRI - At 48±12 h, patients will undergo MRI scanning, including a T1-weighted&#xD;
      sagittal localizer, DWI, Gradient Recalled Echo (GRE)/Susceptibility Weighted Imaging (SWI),&#xD;
      diffusion-weighted (DWI) and perfusion-weighted images (PWI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 7 MRI Scan (Secondary Endpoint) - A repeat MRI will be obtained at 7±2 days to assess for&#xD;
      new DWI lesion development and evolution of those identified at 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 30 MRI Scan (Secondary Endpoint) - A repeat MRI will be obtained at 30±5 days to assess&#xD;
      for new DWI lesion development and evolution of those identified at 24 hours and 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Hospital - In addition to BP data, GCS and NIHSS scores will be collected in the event of&#xD;
      early neurological deterioration. Both of these scores will also be recorded at the time of&#xD;
      each MRI scan and at hospital discharge or transfer to alternate level of care, i.e.&#xD;
      rehabilitation or long-term care facility. Discharge modified Rankin Scores (mRS) will also&#xD;
      be recorded. Cognitive changes will be assessed with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)&#xD;
      at the time of each MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up (Day 30) - A standardized interview aimed at determining mortality and current&#xD;
      residence of the patient (home/hospital/rehabilitation hospital/long-term care facility) will&#xD;
      be administered at the time of the day 30 MRI. The NIHSS and MoCA scores will also be&#xD;
      recorded, as will modified Rankin scale (mRS) scores. Quality of life will be assessed with&#xD;
      the EQ-5D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Day 90) - This is the standard time point for measuring functional outcomes in stroke&#xD;
      trials, as the bulk of neurological recovery occurs within that time frame. All neurological,&#xD;
      functional and cognitive disability tests will be repeated at this time.&#xD;
