  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of phase I studies in general is to determine the best dose (&quot;maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose&quot;) of a drug, and to find out the most common side effects. The main purpose of&#xD;
      the phase I component of this study specifically is to determine the best dose of the&#xD;
      experimental drug MEK162 and to find out whether the drug is safe in children and adolescents&#xD;
      with tumors that have grown or come back despite standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another purpose of this study is to measure the concentration of drug in the blood to help&#xD;
      understand how much drug gets into the body and how quickly the drug is removed from the&#xD;
      body. Another purpose of this study is to determine whether MEK162 turns off the Ras/Raf/MAP&#xD;
      pathway as expected by measuring this pathway in blood cells. Finally, in this study, the&#xD;
      investigators hope to start finding out whether or not MEK162 causes different types of&#xD;
      tumors in children to shrink or stop growing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of the phase II component of the study is to determine whether MEK162 causes&#xD;
      specific types of tumors in children and adolescents to shrink or stop growing. These&#xD;
      specific types of tumors include low-grade gliomas, tumors in patients with a genetic&#xD;
      condition called neurofibromatosis type 1, and other tumors thought to be caused by abnormal&#xD;
      activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK molecular pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another purpose of this study is for researchers to learn whether specific abnormalities in&#xD;
      the DNA of tumors can help predict whether tumors will respond to MEK162.&#xD;

      PROTOCOL SUMMARY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Patients with non-hematologic malignancies that are recurrent, progressive, or&#xD;
      refractory after standard up-front therapy receiving MEK162 will define the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), and toxicity profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Patients with recurrent or progressive tumors signaling through the ras/raf pathway&#xD;
      after standard up-front therapy will be treated in three strata to define the activity of&#xD;
      MEK162.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratum 1: Pediatric patients with recurrent or progressive low-grade glioma (LGG)&#xD;
      characterized by a BRAF truncated fusion (KIAA1549 and similar translocations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratum 2: Pediatric patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and recurrent or&#xD;
      progressive LGG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratum 3: Pediatric patients with recurrent or progressive tumors thought to involve the&#xD;
      ras/raf/MAP pathway but not included in strata 1 or 2. This includes any LGG not included in&#xD;
      strata 1 or 2 (i.e., any LGG without a BRAF truncated fusion in a patient without NF1), any&#xD;
      tumor other than LGG in a patient with NF1, and any other tumor with a known activating BRAF,&#xD;
      NRAS or KRAS mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target validation phase: Patient enrolled on the phase 2 component (any stratum) for whom&#xD;
      tumor biopsy or resection is clinically indicated. Patients will receive MEK162 for 7 to 21&#xD;
      days prior to their surgery. Samples will be analyzed for concentration of drug and target&#xD;
      inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol treatment will last approximately 48 weeks from the start of MEK162 in the absence&#xD;
      of significant toxicity. Treatment will be administered based on the dose escalation schema&#xD;
      for phase 1. Patients in the phase 2 component of the trial will also receive a planned 48&#xD;
      weeks of therapy. Those undergoing planned tumor resection based on clinical criteria will be&#xD;
      eligible to receive 7-21 days of treatment with MEK162 prior to the surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging to assess response will be obtained at the end of cycle 1 (+/- 1 week), at the end of&#xD;
      cycle 3 (+/- 2 weeks) and after every three cycles thereafter (+/- 2 weeks). A cycle will&#xD;
      consist of 28 days (+/- 3 days) and MEK162 will be given continuously. Patients deriving&#xD;
      benefit may continue therapy beyond study completion but all protocol specific evaluations&#xD;
      (other than survival or progression) will conclude after one year. All patients will be&#xD;
      followed with progression as the end point.&#xD;
