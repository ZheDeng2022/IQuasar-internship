    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes (T1D) emerge when the auto-immune destruction exceeds the beta cell's&#xD;
      regenerative capacity. The patients' beta-cell capacity increases shortly after onset when&#xD;
      glucotoxicity decreases after the start of insulin therapy. Children have fewer beta cells&#xD;
      and therefore shorter remission; but the expansion potential is larger the younger the child&#xD;
      is. The problem with the majority of intervention studies is the many and serious side&#xD;
      effects, or a quite marginal effect on the residual beta-cell function. However, in animals&#xD;
      that had received gluten-free diet, the T1D incidence fell from 61% to only 6%. Gluten-free&#xD;
      diet increases the number of regulatory T cells in Peyer's patches, affect the composition of&#xD;
      intestinal microflora and modify the balance between pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines in T&#xD;
      cells. Therefore, the aim of our study is to prolong the remission phase by introducing a&#xD;
      gluten-free diet intervention to children at T1D onset.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterised by a progressive loss and destruction of&#xD;
      beta cells. The optimal timing of intervention is during remission when the beta cells&#xD;
      regenerative power is still present, because we are treating only already diseased children,&#xD;
      and there are enough beta cells to improve outcome if the cells survive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the overall aim of this study is to prolong the remission phase by introducing&#xD;
      glutenfree diet intervention to children with T1D and in addition, investigate the role of&#xD;
      physical activity/fitness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gluten-free diet leads to a shift in balance between the destruction and the&#xD;
           regenerative capacity as well as increases insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The diet have an impact on the gut microbiome composition and projected function,&#xD;
           metabolic, immune and inflammatory biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first study with a non-pharmacological intervention in children combining both&#xD;
      factors with a potential effect on the immune system as well as on insulin sensitivity and&#xD;
      the first to include dietary factors, measures of physical fitness and measures of&#xD;
      inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives: If glutenfree prolong remission other research areas could be interesting such&#xD;
      as change in microRNA following diet change, the influence of diet on fat and carbohydrate&#xD;
      metabolism in children, diet habits in children with diabetes, who makes the healthy choices&#xD;
      or more research of the influence of glucose transporters (GLUT4) in children and insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity. Finally, patients will benefit from a prolonged remission with a decreased&#xD;
      burden of the disease by fewer severe hypoglycemic events, fewer long-term complications and&#xD;
      it will lead to a substantial reduction in the costs for the society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      T1D is a chronic disease with high morbidity and mortality but with preserved beta-cells&#xD;
      there are less hypoglycemic events and less progression in late complications (1), therefore&#xD;
      the preservation and expansion of beta-cells is a goal. Intervention studies in type 1&#xD;
      patients have primarily focused on immune suppressing or immune modulation (2). Most of those&#xD;
      studies have several and serious side effects or no effect on preserving or expanding the&#xD;
      number of beta cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why is gluten a key factor? Animal models have proven that hydrolyzed diet and gluten-free&#xD;
      diet reduces the incidence of diabetes substantially (3-5). Gluten consists of glutenin and&#xD;
      gliadin. Incomplete degradation of gluten irritates the intestinal mucosa, resulting in an&#xD;
      unspecific subclinical inflammation. Compared with conventional foods, a gluten-free diet&#xD;
      increases the number of regulatory T cells in Peyer's patches in the gut (6). Gluten is also&#xD;
      known to affect the composition of the intestinal microflora (7). A gluten-rich diet has been&#xD;
      shown to modify the balance between pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines in T cells (8) Rats&#xD;
      have gut dysfunction and increased gut-permeability, the same is found in pre-T1D humans (9),&#xD;
      and the probable mechanism is that gliadin increases the gut hormone zonulin, which again&#xD;
      increases the gut permeability (10). Enterovirus also increases the gut permeability (11).&#xD;
      The consequences of this can be an increased uptake of bacterial toxins such as&#xD;
      lipopolysaccharides, and incompletely degraded gliadin passing through the gut barrier.&#xD;
      Gliadin has been found in maternal breast milk in healthy mothers. The gliadin must be&#xD;
      transported by the blood, which means that organs with a relatively high blood flow, such as&#xD;
      the islets of Langerhans, could also be exposed to gliadin and may actually accumulate&#xD;
      gliadin. Gluten affect the micro flora in the gut (12). It has been demonstrated that human&#xD;
      microbiota can be transplanted into germ-free mice and transfer host phenotypes&#xD;
      ('personalized gnotobiotics'). Human studies have indicated that the introduction of wheat in&#xD;
      the diet before the age of four months increases the risk of beta-cell auto-immunity by up to&#xD;
      four times (13;14).Two human intervention studies of individuals with a high risk of&#xD;
      developing diabetes who were treated with a gluten-free diet over six or 12 months showed no&#xD;
      impact on diabetes auto-immunity (15) or diabetes incidence (16), but they did show increased&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity during the period with gluten-free diet. The intervention may have been&#xD;
      too short to affect autoimmunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for focusing on the composition of the diet and physical fitness in addition to&#xD;
      gluten During remission phase the insulin can be reduced from a need for up to 2 units/kg to&#xD;
      less than 0.2 units/kg within days/weeks after onset of insulin treatment proving the&#xD;
      influence of glucotoxicity on beta cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dietary requirements of fewer carbohydrates and low glycaemic index have been relaxed&#xD;
      with the introduction of faster-acting types of insulin and pump treatment. But several&#xD;
      studies have shown that intensive treatment can contribute to preserving more beta cells&#xD;
      (17,18), perhaps because the beta cells are quiescent to a higher degree, rather than active,&#xD;
      as active beta cells are more sensitive to toxic stimuli (19). In addition, the composition&#xD;
      of the diet is important for the glycaemic control (20) and potentially affects the immune&#xD;
      system indirectly by affecting the intestinal microflora (21). The quantity and quality of&#xD;
      carbohydrates can also be important for the insulin requirement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity and sedentary lifestyle is known to be associated with insulin resistance&#xD;
      (IR). The association between sedentary lifestyle and IR measured in the fasting state is&#xD;
      partly explained by adipositas, whereas the associations between IR and insulin secretion&#xD;
      based on Oral Glucose Tolerance Test is independent of adipositas (22). Studies also show&#xD;
      higher insulin sensitivity if patients are physical active just before a meal (23) and&#xD;
      increased fitness associates to increased level of glucose transporters (GLUT4) and thereby&#xD;
      the exploit of insulin (24).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research group has been involved in studies of the immune system, risk factors for T1D&#xD;
      and the remission phase for several years. We have already proven that families are&#xD;
      interested in changing diet if there is a chance it prolong remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and material Design: A prospective study including all newly diagnosed children with&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes will be instructed and supervised by a trained dietician to eat a&#xD;
      gluten-free- and low-glycaemic diet within 2 month after diagnosis and followed by a&#xD;
      dedicated team of a medical doctor, a nurse and a dietician at entry in the protocol and at 6&#xD;
      and 12 month after diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diet: Families will be instructed by a dietician in either&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  eating gluten-free&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  normal guidelines concerning carbohydrate in diabetic children The diet will be&#xD;
           estimated based on validated food frequency questionnaire - filled online before study&#xD;
           entry and after 6, 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: Insulin adjusted HbA1c (IDAA1c) (25); Stimulated C-peptide; Insulin dose per&#xD;
      kg Secondary outcome: The alterations in gut microbiome composition and function and&#xD;
      metabolic, immune and inflammatory biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Boost- test (meal-stimulation test) The meal test is done after 8 hours fasting in the&#xD;
      morning. Boost (Med. Johnson, Evansville, Indiana, USA; 237 ml = 8 ounce (OZ); 33 g&#xD;
      carbohydrate, 15 g protein and 6 g fat, 240 kcal): 6 ml/kg (max.: 360 ml). Blood samples and&#xD;
      blood glucose are taken at 0 minutes and again 90 minutes after intake of Boost. The&#xD;
      Boost-test is performed at inclusion plus 6 and 12 month post diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fear of hypoglycemia and Quality of life: We will use validated questionnaire for fear of&#xD;
      hypoglycemia and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gut microbiota: Three stool samples are taken following standard operation procedures (SOP)s)&#xD;
      at the indicated time points (inclusion and 6 month). Stool samples are sent for quantitative&#xD;
      metagenomics and analysis of microbial DNA at Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic&#xD;
      Metabolic Research, Copenhagen University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The level of master transcription factors are responsible for the shift of Cluster&#xD;
      Differentiation (CD) 4+ T cells into different phenotypes: T-bet for Th1 cells, Trans-acting&#xD;
      T-cell-specific transcription factor GATA-3 for Th2, Foxp3 for T-regs, RORγt (retinoic acid&#xD;
      receptor-related orphan nuclear receptor gamma) for Th17, and DX5 as a marker of Natural&#xD;
      Killer cells. Isolated lymphocytes are saved and resuspended in 500 µL Trizol (Invitrogen)&#xD;
      reagent for RNA extraction and stored in -80 ˚C until use. The Bartholin Institute,&#xD;
      Rigshospitalet will be responsible for the study of diet induced proportional changes in the&#xD;
      above mentioned T cell populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics and power calculations Statistics: Multiple linear regression will be used to find&#xD;
      other measures of insulin sensitivity and test factors associated with c-peptide decline and&#xD;
      IdaA1c. Relevant confounders such as age, c-peptide at onset, diabetes duration and gender&#xD;
      will be adjusted for in the models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power: We need 100 individuals, where 50% complete the glutenfree diet, to find a different&#xD;
      in IdaA1c of 1 with a power of 80% and significance of 0.05. The mean in previous cohorts was&#xD;
      10,7 after 12 months and Standard Deviation = 2,0. 27. To find a difference in c-peptide we&#xD;
      need 128 individuals in each group with an 80% power and significance level of 0.05. If we&#xD;
      can use previous cohorts as controls we only need 58 patients in the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility Paediatric Department at Herlev Hospital has at least 60 new children with T1D&#xD;
      each year, and approximately 50% now agrees to participate in the pilot study with glutenfree&#xD;
      diet. We have access to two cohorts of 270 and 129 children respectively both followed for at&#xD;
      least 12 month with boost test at 1,6 and 12 month. Paediatric Department is the largest&#xD;
      center for childhood diabetes in Denmark, we have previously been responsible for follow-up&#xD;
      studies in newly diagnosed children during remission and describe genes and biomarkers (Zink&#xD;
      autoantibodies, Interleukin-1ra, adiponectin, glucagon) associated with remission.&#xD;
      Furthermore we have investigated cytokines and immuno globulins associated with risk of T1D.&#xD;
      We have also found increasing chemokines and unchanged vitamin D in newly diagnosed children.&#xD;
