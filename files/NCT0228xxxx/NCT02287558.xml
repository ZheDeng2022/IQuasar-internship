      This study will evaluate patients &gt; 18 years of age with transfusion-dependent&#xD;
      gastrointestinal bleeding due to documented gastrointestinal vascular ectasia with or without&#xD;
      concurrent hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). This study will focus on documented&#xD;
      bleeding sites in the small bowel, including the duodenum, jejunum and ileum. Eligible&#xD;
      patients will have endoscopically-documented sites of vascular ectasia and will have required&#xD;
      at least 4 units of blood transfusion or episodes of intravenous iron administration over the&#xD;
      preceding four months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label study that will investigate the efficacy and safety profile&#xD;
      of pomalidomide in patients with genetically-documented Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia&#xD;
      (defined by characteristic mutations in Eng, Alk-1 or Smad-4) or idiopathic vascular ectasia&#xD;
      with no documented mutations, leading to refractory bleeding of the small bowel. This study&#xD;
      will be limited to patients with documented bleeding from the small bowel, including the&#xD;
      duodenum, jejunum or ileum. Eligible patients will be dependent on transfusion or intravenous&#xD;
      iron therapy (requiring at least 4 units of blood transfusion or 4 iron infusions over the&#xD;
      preceding 4 months) and will have endoscopically-confirmed areas of vascular ecstasia.&#xD;
      Therapy for all eligible patients will be initiated with a 1 mg daily dose of pomalidomide.&#xD;
      The principal investigator will determine whether intrapatient dose escalation is indicated&#xD;
      based on the response of the patient's bleeding during the first 30 days of therapy. If dose&#xD;
      escalation is indicated, pomalidomide will be increased at the investigator's discretion to a&#xD;
      maximal dose of 5 mg/day. Cessation of GI bleeding will be defined as maintenance of stable&#xD;
      hemoglobin without blood transfusion or intravenous iron therapy over a 4 week period. Once&#xD;
      GI bleeding has ceased, patients will be maintained at a stable pomalidomide dose for an&#xD;
      additional 4 months, and the dose then tapered by 1 mg per month, or until bleeding recurs.&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for a total of six months post-therapy to determine whether the&#xD;
      response is maintained.&#xD;
