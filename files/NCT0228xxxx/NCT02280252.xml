  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The need to understand LABC is especially compelling in populations and countries with&#xD;
      limited resources, where breast cancer incidence is relatively low, but mortality is&#xD;
      comparably high. In these settings access to appropriate cancer care is characteristically&#xD;
      limited or often plainly nonexistent. In contrast to economically developed nations, where on&#xD;
      average fewer than 20% of women present with breast cancer at advanced stages, LABC and&#xD;
      metastatic disease are the most common stages at presentation in 50% or more women in Latin&#xD;
      America, Asia and Africa.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The term -locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) commonly includes tumors whose maximum&#xD;
      diameter is 5 cm (T3) or larger, or which present with involvement of the chest wall or skin.&#xD;
      Surprisingly, the simultaneous presence of clinically detectable distant metastases is&#xD;
      relatively infrequent (~8%), a peculiar finding since in 73% of these large tumors it is&#xD;
      possible to document shedding of tumor cells into the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While LABC has become a rare clinical presentation of breast cancer in the general population&#xD;
      as a result of improved early detection by mammographic screening, it remains relatively&#xD;
      common among minority women of low socioeconomic status. For instance, in a consecutive&#xD;
      series of 363 African-American women presenting in a large urban hospital, one out of three&#xD;
      women newly diagnosed with breast cancer had LABC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well documented that although the incidence of breast cancer among African-Americans is&#xD;
      lower than among white women, breast cancer mortality in African-Americans is significantly&#xD;
      higher. In 1998, the American Cancer Society, the National Cancer Institute and the Centers&#xD;
      for Disease Control and Prevention reported an overall downward trend in cancer incidence and&#xD;
      mortality between 1990 and 1995 for all cancers combined. Many minority and medically&#xD;
      underserved populations, however, did not share equally in these improvements. These patients&#xD;
      have continued to encounter multifactorial barriers to early detection and care, warranting&#xD;
      interventions to improve access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time, it is equally important to offer the best chance for survival to those&#xD;
      underserved women who have already availed themselves of medical care. Paradoxically, while&#xD;
      the medical community is aware of the inadequate accrual of minority patients to clinical&#xD;
      trials, only few trials exist for LABC.&#xD;
