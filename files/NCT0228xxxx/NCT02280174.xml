  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overproduction of intestinally derived triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) (chylomicrons)&#xD;
      has recently been described in type 2 diabetes (T2DM), as is known for hepaticTRL&#xD;
      (very-low-density lipoprotein) production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an interest in identifying therapies that would favourably influence postprandial&#xD;
      concentrations of lipids in T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      linagliptin is a potent and selective inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV), and has&#xD;
      been shown to reduce fasting and postprandial glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mainly through incretin hormone-mediated improvements in islet function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although clinical studies to date indicate that fasting lipid levels are minimally affected&#xD;
      by DPP-IV inhibitor treatment, animal studies suggested that DPP-IV inhibition reduce&#xD;
      intestinal triglycerides (TG) absorption and apolipoprotein (apo) production and increased&#xD;
      chylomicron catabolism. Interestingly, a recent study supporting this hypothesis showed that&#xD;
      vildagliptin therapy was able to reduce postprandial intestinal TRL particles in patients&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes. Recently, it had reported that sitagliptin treatment significantly&#xD;
      reduced plasma apoB-48 and TG concentrations in the postprandial state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The action of DPP-IV inhibitors may be explained by insulin secretion or action of&#xD;
      glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) on metabolism of TRL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the present study was designed to examine the effects of linagliptin treatment&#xD;
      (LT) vs standard treatment (ST) on the metabolism of TRL apoB-48 in patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes over a 12 weeks-period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will study the patients in three different moments defined as: Time 0 (2&#xD;
      weeks before LT or ST, Time 1 (4 weeks after LT or ST), Time 2 (12 weeks after LT or ST).&#xD;
      With areas under the curve (AUCs) of apoB48 in postprandial conditions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Uncontrolled type 2 Diabetes patients with HbA1c between 7 and 10% Patients must have&#xD;
      received the maximum tolerated dose of metformin for at least 3 months before randomization.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised to receive linagliptin or standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of seven study visits will be scheduled: at screening, at weeks -4, -2, 0, 4, 6, 12&#xD;
      and 24 week follow-up. During each visit, an endocrinologist will make the physical and&#xD;
      metabolic assessment. Safety and tolerability data will be collected at screening and&#xD;
      throughout the study, and includes incidence of serious and non serious adverse events (AEs)&#xD;
      in linagliptin arms and standard arms. Clinical laboratory data, vital signs, and 12-lead&#xD;
      electrocardiogram parameters at each visit, will be collected. The causal relationships&#xD;
      between study drugs and AEs will be evaluated by the investigators at site. All drug-related&#xD;
      AEs occurring during the study will be followed up until relieved or judged to be no longer&#xD;
      clinically significant. Changes in body weight from baseline until week 12 will also be&#xD;
      assessed. Hypoglycaemic event intensity will be defined as symptoms of hypoglycemia&#xD;
      accompanied by a fingerstick glucose value of ≤ 50 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will study the patients in three different moments defined as: Time 0 (2&#xD;
      weeks before LT or ST), Time 1 (4 weeks after LT or ST), Time 2 (12 weeks after LT or ST). T1&#xD;
      show the direct effect (independent of metabolic changes) and T2 show indirect effect (depend&#xD;
      of metabolic changes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each phase, following an overnight fast, an intravenous catheter will be inserted into a&#xD;
      superficial vein in each forearm for blood sampling. After an overnight fast, subjects were&#xD;
      admitted in the research unit for a 24-h period and received un isocaloric (900 kcal), mixed&#xD;
      meals (75 g carbohydrates, 50 g fat (60% saturated), 35 g protein), at time points 7.00 a.m.&#xD;
      (breakfast). Blood samples will drawn before and 2, 4, 6, 8, after the meal. The area under&#xD;
      curve (AUC) and incremental AUC (IAUC) for postprandial variables will calculate in each&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the morning after each phase study: basal (T0) and incretin conditions (T1 and T2),&#xD;
      subjects will undergo hyperglycaemic clamp and hyperinsulinaemic clamp, successively. The&#xD;
      insulin secretion rate and insulin sensitivity index will be measured during the last 30&#xD;
      minutes of the clamp, respectively in two arms of the study.&#xD;
