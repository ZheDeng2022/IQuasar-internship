  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study 4975-MN-202 is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, single-injection&#xD;
      study in which subjects will be randomized to receive three doses of CNTX-4975 or placebo&#xD;
      injected into the intermetatarsal space around a Morton's neuroma. The injection of study&#xD;
      medication will be administered by ultrasound-guided needle placement following ankle block&#xD;
      anesthesia. The study staff will telephone subjects at Week 1 postinjection and subjects will&#xD;
      return to the clinic postinjection at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 for study assessments.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence from sexual intercourse since the last menses before IP&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. The subject has more than one painful intermetatarsal neuroma in the affected foot&#xD;
             which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with evaluation of the&#xD;
             symptoms and functional limitations that arise from the intermetatarsal neuroma in the&#xD;
             affected foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Radiography within 6 months of the Treatment Visit (Day 1) to exclude musculoskeletal&#xD;
             pathology must be performed, to include any osseous abnormality such as stress&#xD;
             fracture, osteophyte, tumor, or cyst in the bones or toes adjacent to the third&#xD;
             inter-metatarsal space or any significant evidence of arthritis in the joints of the&#xD;
             3rd and 4th metatarsal-phalangeal joints or inter-phalangeal joints of the 3rd and 4th&#xD;
             toes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Previous neurectomy in the same nerve.&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Other painful foot pathology (e.g., bunion, hammertoe, plantar fasciitis etc.) or&#xD;
             evidence of clinically meaningful ischemia which, in the judgment of the investigator&#xD;
             and the medical monitor, would interfere with evaluation of the symptoms and&#xD;
             functional limitations that arise from the intermetatarsal neuroma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Other chronic pain anywhere in the body that is greater than or equal to the intensity&#xD;
             of foot pain from intermetatarsal neuroma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Signs of arterial insufficiency in the feet, including clinically meaningful edema.&#xD;

             affected foot for Morton's neuroma.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Presence of any medical condition or unstable health status that, in the judgment of&#xD;
             the investigator, might adversely impact the conduct of the study or resulting data,&#xD;
             including chronic conditions that are likely to alter the rate of healing or are&#xD;
             likely to result in safety complications unrelated to the study medication, such as&#xD;
             uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or vascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Regular use of anticoagulant blood thinners (except low-dose aspirin or Plavix which&#xD;
             are allowed).&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Active cutaneous disease at the anticipated site of study drug injection that would&#xD;
             prevent the safe administration of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Ulcer or open wound anywhere on the affected foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory result at the Screening Visit (in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Has diabetic neuropathy or other peripheral neuropathy in the affected foot.&#xD;

             Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Health Disorders, fifth edition, has&#xD;
             current evidence for a substance use disorder, is receiving medicinal treatment for&#xD;
             drug abuse, or tests positive upon urine drug screen for a substance of abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Has a positive pregnancy test at the Screening or Treatment Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Has any condition or is taking any medication that would be contraindicated for study&#xD;
