  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regardless of their treatment, cancer patients endure a variety of difficult symptoms during&#xD;
      their disease with averages ranging from 7 to 14 symptoms each. Cancer-related symptoms,&#xD;
      especially when symptoms are very intense, distressing, frequent, or interfere with daily&#xD;
      activities, can lead to depression, anxiety, and diminished quality of life. Improving their&#xD;
      ability to self-manage difficult symptoms has the potential to diminish suffering, improve&#xD;
      quality of life and decrease emergency room visits and associated costs. The investigators&#xD;
      propose to test a brief, effective intervention with outpatients in a cancer center, with the&#xD;
      goal of teaching patients symptom management skills for self-identified symptoms of highest&#xD;
      priority to patients. Objective: The proposed randomized clinical trial will test the&#xD;
      efficacy of the COPE intervention with patients with symptoms of moderate to high intensity,&#xD;
      distress, frequency or interference with their lives as a result of their cancer. Method: The&#xD;
      investigators will seek 300 completed subjects, outpatients with breast, colorectal, lung,&#xD;
      and prostate cancers. Patients will be randomized into three groups. Group III, the&#xD;
      experimental group, will receive usual care plus the COPE intervention. This group will&#xD;
      receive 3 individual intervention sessions. During the first intervention visit at the cancer&#xD;
      center, the COPE group will be taught the COPE intervention in a session focusing on the&#xD;
      patient's self-identified most bothersome symptom. Role modeling and additional instruction&#xD;
      will be provided via video, and patients will receive the Home Care Guide for Cancer and a&#xD;
      copy of the video to take home. Three subsequent visits with the patient during regularly&#xD;
      scheduled clinic visits will reinforce the principles of COPE and the use of the Home Care&#xD;
      Guide, and will help patients apply this approach to managing other symptoms. In addition&#xD;
      they will get 2 phone calls encouraging them to apply COPE. Group II, the attention control&#xD;
      group, will receive supportive visits from the research team at the cancer center and&#xD;
      subsequent meetings during clinic visits plus 2 subsequent supportive telephone calls,&#xD;
      matched for time with COPE participants. Group I, the control group receiving usual care,&#xD;
      will receive no additional attention from our interventionists. Data will be collected weekly&#xD;
      for 9 weeks about symptoms (intensity, frequency, interference, appraisal of distress),&#xD;
      self-efficacy, and barriers to self-management. Patient Outcomes: Quality of life, anxiety&#xD;
      and depression will be assessed at baseline and weeks 4, 8, and 12. The investigators predict&#xD;
      that the COPE group will show significant improvement in depression, anxiety, quality of&#xD;
      life, symptom intensity, distress, frequency and interference, self-efficacy, and perceived&#xD;
      barriers to care, as well as decreased utilization of health care resources compared with the&#xD;
      two control groups. Data will be analyzed using repeated measures multivariate analysis of&#xD;
      variance using a mixed model approach.&#xD;
