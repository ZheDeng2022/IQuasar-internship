  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well regorafenib works in reducing the return of disease in&#xD;
      patients with rectal cancer that has not spread to another place in the body who have&#xD;
      completed curative-intent treatment. Regorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Regorafenib may also help keep cancer&#xD;
      from coming back after it has disappeared following the initial therapy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the 3-year disease free survival in patients with T3, T4 or node-positive&#xD;
      rectal adenocarcinoma who received regorafenib maintenance therapy following the completion&#xD;
      of curative-intent standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the cumulative incidence of local recurrence, distant recurrence and overall&#xD;
      survival at 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore for biomarkers associated with anti-cancer effects of regorafenib maintenance&#xD;
      therapy in curatively treated rectal cancer patients by analyzing tumor and blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive regorafenib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 28 days for up to 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 4&#xD;
      months for up to 5 years.&#xD;
