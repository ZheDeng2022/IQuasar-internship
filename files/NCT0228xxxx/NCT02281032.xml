      BACKGROUND Nursing homes are important locations for palliative care. Through comprehensive&#xD;
      geriatric assessments (CGAs), evaluations can be made of the palliative care needs of nursing&#xD;
      home residents. The interRAI Palliative Care instrument (interRAI PC) is a CGA that evaluates&#xD;
      diverse palliative care needs of adults in all healthcare settings. The evaluation results in&#xD;
      Client Assessment Protocols (CAPs: indications of problems that need addressing) and Scales&#xD;
      (e.g. Palliative Index for Mortality (PIM)) which can be used to design, evaluate and adjust&#xD;
      care plans. This study aims to examine the effect of using the interRAI PC on the quality of&#xD;
      palliative care in nursing homes. Additionally, it aims to evaluate the feasibility and&#xD;
      validity of the interRAI PC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS This study covers phases 0, I and II of the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework&#xD;
      for designing and evaluating complex interventions, with a longitudinal, quasi-experimental&#xD;
      pretest-posttest design and with mixed methods of evaluation. In phase 0, a systematic&#xD;
      literature search is conducted. In phase I, the interRAI PC instrument is adapted for use in&#xD;
      Belgium and implemented on the BelRAI-website and a practical training is developed. In phase&#xD;
      II, the intervention is tested in fifteen nursing homes. Participating nursing homes fill out&#xD;
      the interRAI PC during one year for all residents receiving palliative care. Using a&#xD;
      pretest-posttest design with quasi-random assignment to the intervention or control group,&#xD;
      the effect of the interRAI PC on the quality of palliative care is evaluated with the&#xD;
      Palliative care Outcome Scale (POS). Psychometric analysis is conducted to evaluate the&#xD;
      predictive validity of the PIM and the convergent validity of the CAP 'Mood' of the interRAI&#xD;
      PC. Qualitative data regarding the usability and face validity of the instrument are&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DISCUSSION This is the first study to evaluate the validity and effect of the interRAI PC in&#xD;
      nursing homes, following a methodology based on the MRC framework. This approach improves the&#xD;
      study design and implementation and will contribute to a higher generalizability of results.&#xD;
      The final result will be a psychometrically evaluated CGA for nursing home residents&#xD;
      receiving palliative care.&#xD;

    <description>15 experimental nursing homes:&#xD;
Caregivers of 15 participating nursing homes receive a training about the interRAI PC and the BelRAI webapplication&#xD;
Caregivers of 15 experimental nursing homes fill out the interRAI PC multidisciplinary every three months during one year for all nursing home residents with palliative care needs. Based on the results (Client Assessment Protocols and Scales) of the interRAI PC instrument, care plans are being evaluated, adapted and designed.</description>
