  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia and bipolar disorders are major public health problems. The second generation&#xD;
      anti-psychotic drugs have efficacy for both positive and negative symptoms and a favorable&#xD;
      risk profile as far as movement disorders. However, these drugs are associated with&#xD;
      clinically significant weight gain and metabolic effects. The underlying mechanisms of these&#xD;
      side effects are unclear, however in our preliminary studies with schizophrenic patients on&#xD;
      atypical anti-psychotic drugs, we found that weight gain and vitamin D deficiency was present&#xD;
      in about 50% of this population. Given the considerable heterogeneity among the patients on&#xD;
      atypical anti-psychotics and potential for weight gain in vitamin D-deficient states, we&#xD;
      propose that patients with schizophrenia who gain weight on atypical antipsychotic&#xD;
      medications are vitamin D-deficient. This hypothesis will be tested in patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia receiving second-generation anti-psychotic drugs for a minimum duration of 4&#xD;
      months. Specific Aim: We predict that the patients with schizophrenia, who gain weight with&#xD;
      antipsychotic treatment, are vitamin D-deficient compared to the patients who do not gain&#xD;
      weight. We will examine circulating levels of serum 25(OH)D, mRNA transcripts and protein&#xD;
      expression of vitamin D receptor (VDR) and the enzymes, CYP24A and CYP27B, in the white blood&#xD;
      cells of the subjects and correlate with BMI and the blood levels of leptin and adiponectin.&#xD;

      Specific Aim: We predict that the patients with schizophrenia, who gain weight with&#xD;
      antipsychotic treatment, are vitamin D-deficient compared to the patients who do not gain&#xD;
      weight. We will examine circulating levels of serum 25(OH)D, mRNA transcripts and protein&#xD;
      expression of vitamin D receptor (VDR) and the enzymes, CYP24A and CYP27B, in the white blood&#xD;
      cells of the subjects and correlate with BMI and the blood levels of leptin and adiponectin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Approach:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of Patients: Subjects will be recruited from the psychiatry clinics of&#xD;
      Alegent-Creighton Clinics where the PI is working on a full-time basis. Dr. Selvaraj, the PI&#xD;
      of this project, provides psychiatric care annually to an average of 300 patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. In addition, other psychiatrists in the same clinic also&#xD;
      see patients with schizophrenia. Thus, there is an ample population available for this study.&#xD;
      The patients will be recruited based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, as shown in&#xD;
      Figure 1. Patients with schizophrenia who are on the atypical antipsychotic, quetiapine, will&#xD;
      be recruited. The underlying major mechanism of action of this anti-psychotic medication is&#xD;
      to block both dopamine (D2 and D4) and serotonin (5-HT2A and 5-HT2c) receptors (24). Also,&#xD;
      this antipsychotic medication has been shown to increase weight in the patients. According to&#xD;
      the data, mean increase in weight after 8-10 weeks on anti-psychotics is about 12.2 lbs with&#xD;
      quetiapine (24). In most cases, increase in weight reaches to a plateau within 8-10 weeks&#xD;
      (24). Therefore, we will recruit age-matched patients who have been taking quetiapine 100mg&#xD;
      or more for at least 12 weeks. There is no relationship in weight gain and the severity of&#xD;
      psychosis or the dose of the anti-psychotic drug. During the first episode, most of these&#xD;
      patients are in their 20s and 30s. The patients will be divided into two experimental groups:&#xD;
      (i) &quot;Weight gain&quot; and (ii) &quot;No weight gain&quot;. In the weight gain group, we will recruit those&#xD;
      patients who have gained 10% increase from the baseline weight. In the no weight group, we&#xD;
      will recruit patients who have lost weight, did not gain weight or have gained weight &lt;5%&#xD;
      over the baseline weight. The baseline weight data and other information will be obtained&#xD;
      from the electronic health record through the EPICS system, upon recruitment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The human research protocol with the Informed Consent and HIPPA forms has been approved by&#xD;
      the Institutional Review Board of Creighton University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: The association between weight gain and vitamin D deficiency will be&#xD;
      analyzed using 2x2 contingency tables and tests for independence. The three most common tests&#xD;
      for independence are the likelihood ratio test (LRT), the Pearson's chi-square statistic, and&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test. Both Pearson's chi-square and Fisher's exact test will be used to&#xD;
      analyze the data. If the expected number of counts in any one cell is less than five (5),&#xD;
      only Fisher's exact test will be reported. The purpose of this pilot is to estimate/confirm a&#xD;
      reasonable confidence interval for the true odds ratio and reference proportion to design a&#xD;
      larger scale study. We believe we can reasonably recruit between 30 and 40 patients. Should&#xD;
      we recruit a total of 40 patients, we believe we can achieve a minimum detectable odds ratio&#xD;
      of 9 (with desired power of 0.80 and significance level of 0.05) with reference proportion of&#xD;
      0.35. This initial analysis was based on a preliminary study where 35% of schizophrenic&#xD;
      patients gained weight on atypical antipsychotic drugs. Since there is no follow up of these&#xD;
      patients, but the collection of the blood and clinical data only at one time point, the&#xD;
      question of potential drop-outs or the follow-ups does not arise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age-matched subjects of both sex and all ethnicities will participate in this study.&#xD;
      Potential subjects will be approached by treating clinicians (inpatient or outpatient) for&#xD;
      possible participation; or potential study participants may respond to advertisements in the&#xD;
      form of IRB approved flyers that will be distributed at area hospitals and medical clinics.&#xD;
      Patients who indicate interest in the study will be asked to sign an informed consent to&#xD;
      allow research personnel to review clinical records and speak with the PI or other treating&#xD;
      physician about appropriateness for protocol participation. In the Alegent-Creighton clinics&#xD;
      we have sufficient number of minority patients, including African-Americans, Hispanics and&#xD;
      women. No children will be recruited in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Protocol: Upon the recruitment of the subjects in this study, the following&#xD;
      information will be collected for each of the 40 patients: (i) Demographic data, including&#xD;
      age, sex, ethnicity, duration of the illness and the medication regimen and (ii)&#xD;
      Anthropometry data, including height, weight, BMI, blood pressure, pulse rate. The following&#xD;
      psychiatric rating scale will be used as a diagnostic measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.), a well known psychiatric&#xD;
      diagnostic interview protocol, will be administered at baseline before collecting the blood&#xD;
      sample. The M.I.N.I. includes items that assess the hallmark symptoms of the exclusionary&#xD;
      psychotic depression, other psychotic disorders, bipolar disorder, eating disorder and&#xD;
      substance dependence. We will use these modules only to help exclude patients with the&#xD;
      prescribed diagnoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the MINI protocol, 40 ml venous blood, in a fasting state, will be collected in&#xD;
      three separate vacutainer EDTA tubes. One tube of 10 ml will be sent to the Clinical&#xD;
      Pathology Laboratories for the measurement of complete blood count, complete metabolic panel,&#xD;
      fasting lipid profile for the measurement of triglycerides, high density lipoproteins, low&#xD;
      density lipoproteins, very low-density lipoproteins. The complete blood count and complete&#xD;
      metabolic panel will be done to rule out infection or any other co-morbidity. Another 10 ml&#xD;
      tube will be sent to Clinical Pathology lab for the measurement of serum 25-hydroxy D levels.&#xD;
      The third tube with 20 ml blood will be used for isolating buffy coat to measure protein and&#xD;
      mRNA expression of vitamin D receptor (VDR), CYP24A1 and CYP27B1, and for separating serum to&#xD;
      measure leptin and adiponectin levels. This latter part will be done in the research&#xD;
      laboratory of the PI using the following procedures.&#xD;
