    <textblock>
      MicroPort Orthopedics (MPO) is conducting this PMCF study to evaluate the safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of its THA and resurfacing components marketed in the EU. These types of studies are required&#xD;
      by regulatory authorities for all THA and resurfacing devices that do not have medium to&#xD;
      long-term clinical evidence available at the time of gaining approval to market in the EU.&#xD;
      This study has been designed in accordance with MEDDEV 2.12/2 rev 2.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      MicroPort Orthopedics Inc. (MPO) currently markets several total hip arthroplasty (THA) and&#xD;
      resurfacing components throughout the world, including the European Union (EU). As part of&#xD;
      the process for gaining approval to market in the EU, MPO is conducting this post market&#xD;
      clinical follow-up (PMCF) study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these components. The&#xD;
      objectives of this study are to evaluate component survivorship, total functional outcome&#xD;
      scores, and radiographic outcomes of implanted subjects at out to 10 years follow-up.&#xD;
