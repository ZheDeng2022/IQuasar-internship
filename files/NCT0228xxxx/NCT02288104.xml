      This study is a prospective study in order to demonstrate the technical feasibility and&#xD;
      safety of doing endomicroscopic imaging during interventional radiology procedure in two main&#xD;
      indications: Kidneys and liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This innovative study will involve the use of probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy. The&#xD;
      proposed study is a feasibility study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interventional radiology is a medical sub-specialty of radiology which utilizes&#xD;
      minimally-invasive image-guided procedures to diagnose and treat diseases in nearly every&#xD;
      organ. The concept behind interventional radiology is to diagnose and treat patients using&#xD;
      less invasive techniques currently available in order to minimize risk to the patient and&#xD;
      improve health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For many years, surgery was the only treatment available for many conditions. Today,&#xD;
      interventional radiology treatments are frst-line care for a wide variety of conditions.&#xD;
      Patients should be offered the least invasive option frst. It is important to get a second&#xD;
      opinion and know all of your treatment options before consenting to any procedure or surgery.&#xD;
      Interventional radiologists are specialists in minimally invasive treatments, have a unique&#xD;
      breadth of training and provide consults to every type of specialist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical removal of liver tumors offers the best chance for a cure. Unfortunately, liver&#xD;
      tumors are often inoperable because the tumor may be too large, or has grown into major blood&#xD;
      vessels or other vital structures. Sometimes, many small tumors are spread throughout the&#xD;
      liver, making surgery too risky or impractical. Surgical removal is not possible for more&#xD;
      than two-thirds of primary liver cancer patients and 90 percent of patients with secondary&#xD;
      liver cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are to demonstrate the technical feasibility and safety of doing&#xD;
      endomicroscopic imaging during interventional radiology procedure in two main indications:&#xD;
      liver and kidneys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary objective is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study and demonstrate the technical feasibility and safety of doing endomicroscopic&#xD;
      imaging during interventional radiology procedure in two main indications: liver and kidney.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the safety of the use of Endomicroscopic imaging during interventional radiology&#xD;
           procedure in two main indications: liver and kidney.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the quality of biopsies performed with the help of Cellvizio.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Build a database of images as an atlas and define image interpretation criteria in&#xD;
           collaboration with pathologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate whether and how Cellvizio can improve guidance for biopsies or ablations: for&#xD;
      instance, in the critical structures such as nerves or vessels in the vicinity of the&#xD;
      cryoablation area, is it possible to visualize ice crystals and therefore decide to stop the&#xD;
      cryoablation at the right time/location?&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both applications, technical feedback from the physicians is expected on how they think&#xD;
      the combined use of the devices could change the care path. E.g. a certain step in the&#xD;
      workflow might become obsolete or the workflow could lead to fewer patient visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the safety of this protocol, the use of endomicroscopy will not change in any way the&#xD;
      patient management and standard procedure, including the diagnosis nor treatment decisions.&#xD;
      All the adverse events / serious adverse events will be noted during the procedure and one&#xD;
      week after the procedure.&#xD;
