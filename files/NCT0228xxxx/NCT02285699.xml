    <textblock>
      This study will examine the gut microbiota and serum inflammatory markers in patients with&#xD;
      Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder vs. healthy controls. Phase II of the study will examine the&#xD;
      gut microbiota and cytokine levels following 12-weeks of treatment with Selective Serotonin&#xD;
      Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase I of the study will involve 25 healthy controls (no anxiety or mood disorders) and 25&#xD;
      outpatients with primary DSM 5 OCD. Participants ages 18-65 will be assessed using the Mini&#xD;
      International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) to determine whether criteria for a primary&#xD;
      OCD diagnosis is met alongside any additional comorbid disorders. Healthy controls will also&#xD;
      be assessed using the MINI to confirm the absence of any psychiatric disorders. Participants&#xD;
      will complete a number of clinician and self-rated symptom severity scales as listed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Yale Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) - Clinician-rated b. Montgomery Asberg&#xD;
      Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) - Clinician-rated c. Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory - Revised&#xD;
      (OCI-R) - Self-rated d. Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) - Self-rated e. Dutch&#xD;
      Dimensional Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (DDOCS) - Self-rated&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. They will also complete additional questionnaires pertaining to their diet and bowel&#xD;
      functioning:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Short-form Leeds Dyspepsia Questionnaire (SF-LDQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Rome III criteria for Irritable Bowel Syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assessment of diet using the Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria Food Frequency&#xD;
           Questionnaire (ACCVFFQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
           3. Subjects will also be asked to provide background information regarding travel in the&#xD;
           past 4 months and current place (and duration) of residence as these factors may&#xD;
           potentially affect the microbiome profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4. Patients will be weighed and their height measured to determine body mass index&#xD;
           (BMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
           5. Those who meet study criteria will be provided with a collection kit and instructed&#xD;
           on appropriate fecal sample collection. The sample should be the first bowel movement of&#xD;
           the day. Participants will have a blood sample drawn to examine serum levels of IL-6,&#xD;
           TNF- α and CRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fecal Sample Collection Patients and healthy controls will collect fecal samples at home&#xD;
      using the investigators well-established protocol. Stool samples will be collected and&#xD;
      transferred to a sterile screw capped sample jar and placed in a standard household freezer.&#xD;
      The samples will be transported on the cooling pad to study personnel at the MacAnxiety&#xD;
      Research Centre where they will be stored in a study freezer before transport to McMaster&#xD;
      University. In the laboratory, part of the stool sample will be transferred into four 2-ml&#xD;
      cryovials and snap frozen using liquid nitrogen for molecular analysis of microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants interested in pharmacological treatment for their OCD symptoms after completing&#xD;
      phase 1, will have the option to continue into phase 2 of the study. Here participants will&#xD;
      receive 12-weeks of standard open-label treatment with an SSRI. During this 12 week period,&#xD;
      subjects will attend 5 additional visits. The first 3 visits will occur once every 2 weeks&#xD;
      while visits 4 and 5 will occur at weeks 8 and 12 of treatment. As per the APA guidelines&#xD;
      (APA 2007) participants will receive 4-6 weeks of treatment at the optimal dosage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The visits will be organized as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline Visit: This visit will correspond with the procedures outlined in Part One of&#xD;
           the study. Participants will also begin open-label SSRI treatment at this visit, once&#xD;
           blood and stool samples have been collected. In this Phase the clinician will also&#xD;
           complete the following scales at each visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) - Clinician-rated ii. Clinical&#xD;
           Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) - Clinician-rated&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. During each visit (visits 2-5) participants will be assessed by the treating physician&#xD;
           to determine whether modifications to SSRI dosage are warranted. Dosage increases will&#xD;
           be based on response to present dose and experienced side effects. The clinician-rated&#xD;
           Y-BOCS and MADRS will also be completed at each visit. Patients will complete the&#xD;
           ACCVFFQ at visit 3 (week 4). The medication dosage will not be increased after visit 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Visit 6 (week 12): Participants will undergo usual assessment, treatment response will&#xD;
           also be determined at this visit (CGI-I score ≤ 2 as well as a 30% drop in YBOCS score).&#xD;
           Participants will be provided with a collection kit and instructed on appropriate fecal&#xD;
           sample collection (as outlined above). The sample collected will be the first bowel&#xD;
           movement of the day. Blood samples will be drawn at a local Gamma-Dynacare lab to&#xD;
           examine serum levels of IL-6, TNF α and CRP. Patient diet will also be assessed using&#xD;
           the ACCVFFQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. After returning the fecal sample and completing the bloodwork, participants will begin a&#xD;
           2-week taper period where the subject will be instructed to gradually reduce the dosage&#xD;
           of the prescribed SSRI. Participants will have the option to continue treatment in the&#xD;
           situation where they wish to do so.&#xD;
