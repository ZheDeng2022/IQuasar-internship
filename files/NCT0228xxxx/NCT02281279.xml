    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of romidepsin and lenalidomide&#xD;
      when combined with rituximab and to see how well this combination works in treating patients&#xD;
      with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has returned (recurrent) or did not respond to&#xD;
      treatment (refractory). Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, may block cancer growth in&#xD;
      different ways by targeting certain cells. Romidepsin and lenalidomide may stop the growth of&#xD;
      cancer cells by blocking enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving rituximab together with&#xD;
      romidepsin and lenalidomide may be a better treatment for B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of romidepsin, rituximab&#xD;
      and lenalidomide in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).&#xD;
      (Phase I) II. To assess the overall response rate (ORR) of this combination in patients with&#xD;
      transformed follicular lymphoma (FL). (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the toxicity and safety of romidepsin in combination with lenalidomide and&#xD;
      rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess complete response rate (CR), progression free survival (PFS), and overall&#xD;
      survival (OS) of this combination in patients with transformed FL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the impact of B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) mutations on ORR among patients&#xD;
      treated with this combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the impact of BCL2 mutations on PFS among patients treated with this&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of romidepsin and lenalidomide followed by&#xD;
      a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on day 1; romidepsin IV over 4&#xD;
      hours on either day 1, days 1 and 8, or days 1, 8, and 15; and lenalidomide orally (PO) on&#xD;
      days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and&#xD;
      then every 6 months for 3 years.&#xD;
