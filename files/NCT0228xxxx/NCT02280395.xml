  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, controlled, multi-center study to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of RUT058-60 (Group A) as an intra-cavity lavage compared to&#xD;
      sterile saline (Group B) in adult subjects undergoing abdominal surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-surgical site infections account for approximately 20% of total healthcare-associated&#xD;
      infections (HAI), making surgical site infections the most common HAI in US hospitals.&#xD;
      Despite the routine use of prophylactic systemic antibiotics and improvements in surgical&#xD;
      techniques, surgical site infections continue to be associated with significant morbidity,&#xD;
      reduction in quality of life and overall cost following abdominal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ruthigen is conducting this Phase I/II clinical study to evaluate the safety and potential&#xD;
      efficacy of RUT058-60 in preventing surgical deep incisional and organ space infection in&#xD;
      subjects undergoing abdominal surgery as an adjunctive therapy to prophylactic systemic&#xD;
      antibiotics.&#xD;
