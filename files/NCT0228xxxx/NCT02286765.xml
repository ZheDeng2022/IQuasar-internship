    <textblock>
      Up to 20 enrolled subjects will be treated. Subjects will receive two Ulthera® treatments on&#xD;
      the axillas provided 30 days apart. Follow-up visits will occur at 7, 30, 90 and 180 days&#xD;
      following the last treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol amendment: The study was expanded to enroll an additional 20 subjects into Group A.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, single-center, randomized clinical trial. Up to 20 subjects who&#xD;
      are naïve to Ultherapy for treatment of hyperhidrosis will be enrolled and treated at a 2.0mm&#xD;
      depth at two different treatment densities (Group A and Group B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A will include up to 10 treated subjects. Subjects receiving treatment in a 3 x 4 grid,&#xD;
      12 treatment squares, 60 lines of treatment per square, at one treatment depth (2.0mm), at&#xD;
      0.30 J of energy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B will include up to 10 treated subjects. Subjects receiving treatment in a 3 x 4 grid,&#xD;
      12 treatment squares, 40 lines of treatment per square, at one treatment depth (2.0mm), at&#xD;
      0.30 J of energy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gravimetric sweat production measures and starch iodine tests will be completed at baseline,&#xD;
      treatment visit #2, and at all follow-ups for all study groups. Digital images of the starch&#xD;
      iodine test will be obtained. Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) scores will be&#xD;
      obtained at baseline, each treatment visit, and at all follow-ups for all study groups.&#xD;
