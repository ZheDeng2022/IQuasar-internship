      The current study aimed to explore the pharmacokinetics of temocillin in patients treated&#xD;
      with haemodialysis and to demonstrated whether or not the pharmacodynamics target of a time&#xD;
      above a MIC of 16 mg/L of more than 40 and 60 % of the dosing interval could be obtained with&#xD;
      a dosing schedule of 1 gram/24 hours, 2 gram/48 hours and 3 gram/72 hours, all of these doses&#xD;
      given after haemodialysis sessions only.&#xD;

      Background: Temocillin is a renally cleared penicillin with long serum half-live and potent&#xD;
      activity against most gram-negative bacteria, making it an ideal candidate for treatment&#xD;
      given on dialysis days only of severe gram-negative infections in patients with ESRD treated&#xD;
      with haemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: The current study aimed to demonstrated by measurement of AUC whether or not the&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics target of a time above a MIC of 8 and 16 mg/L of more than 40 and 60 % of&#xD;
      the dosing interval could be obtained with a dosing schedule of 1 gram/24 hours, 2 gram/48&#xD;
      hours and 3 gram/72 hours, all of these doses given after haemodialysis sessions only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: Key pharmacokinetic and dialytic parameters were determined as previously&#xD;
      described16. The following parameters were recorded: the volume of distribution Vd&#xD;
      (determined as Vd = dose / (Tempeak - Temtrough) in liter); the Vd/Wt (in liter/kg body&#xD;
      weight); the non-dialysis clearance of temocillin (Ke(non-dialysis) = [ln(Tempeak) -&#xD;
      ln(Tempre)] / time between peak level and start of next dialysis); the non-dialysis half-life&#xD;
      (T1/2(non-dialysis) = 0.693 / Ke(non-dialysis) in hours); the dialysis clearance of&#xD;
      temocillin (Ke(dialysis) = [ln(Tempre) - ln(Tempost)] / dialysis duration); the dialysis&#xD;
      half-life (T1/2(dialysis) = 0.693 / Ke(dialysis) in hours); the Urea Reduction Ratio (URR =&#xD;
      (BUNpre - BUNpost) / BUNpre); the Temocillin Reduction Ratio TRR = (Tempre - Tempost) /&#xD;
      Tempre); the Temocillin Removal Ratio (the total amount of temocillin recovered in the&#xD;
      dialysate, based on the area under the curve of the temocillin removal rate and the treatment&#xD;
      time); and the AUC of temocillin. For all PK/PD analysis, the non-compartmental method using&#xD;
      RStudio 0.98.501 with R 3.0.2 software was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Pharmacokinetic study measuring total and free temocillin concentrations in patients&#xD;
      treated with intermittent haemodialysis and temocillin. Blood samples were drawn just before,&#xD;
      and at 0.5, 3, 6, 12, 20 (before dialysis) and 24 (at the end of dialysis) hours after start&#xD;
      of the infusion when patients were dialysed with a 1-day interval; just before and at 0.5, 3,&#xD;
      6, 12, 24, 36, 44 (before dialysis) and 48 (at the end of dialysis) hours after start of the&#xD;
      infusion when patients were dialysed with a 2-day interval, and just before and at 0.5, 3, 6,&#xD;
      12, 24, 36, 48, 68 (before dialysis) and 72 (at the end of dialysis) hours after start of the&#xD;
      infusion if patients were dialysed with a 3-day interval. Patients were followed for 1 to 6&#xD;
      subsequent AUC. Dialysate samples were taken 1, 2, 3 and 4 h after the start of dialysis. All&#xD;
      samples were taken from an arterial or venous catheter, after thorough rinsing. Serum&#xD;
      (obtained by centrifugation after blood clotting) and dialysate was frozen (-80 C)&#xD;
      immediately after sampling until analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temocillin total and free concentrations were determined with high performance liquid&#xD;
      chromotography(HPLC) with a LiChrospher 100 RP-18 5 Î¼m column (Merck AG), using an elution&#xD;
      buffer 100 mM Na acetate buffer pH 7/acetonitrile (95:5, v/v), a flow rate 1 mL/min and a&#xD;
      Waters 2690 Alliance System (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA), with quantification at 235 nm&#xD;
      as previously described.&#xD;
