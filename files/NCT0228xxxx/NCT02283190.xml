  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erwinaze will be administered intravenously at a dose of 25,000 IU/m2 (dose cohort 0) for 6&#xD;
      doses MWF over a period of 2 weeks to 9 patients (as described below and in the following&#xD;
      schema). Blood counts, chemistries including bilirubin, amylase and lipase, and coagulation&#xD;
      studies including fibrinogen will be measured and reviewed before each asparaginase dose.&#xD;
      Fibrinogen (&lt;100 mg/dL) can be replaced with cryoprecipitate before each dose at the&#xD;
      discretion of treating physician. Treatment will be stopped for elevation of amylase, lipase&#xD;
      or direct bilirubin above normal range.&#xD;

      For safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Erwinaze has been already used in clinical practice for treatment of patients with acute&#xD;
      leukemia with known side effect profile. For this reason, in this protocol, we use the&#xD;
      &quot;3+3+3&quot; design for evaluation of safety based on pre-determined dose-limiting toxicities&#xD;
      (DLT). In the &quot;3+3+3&quot; design, the dose escalation rules proceed by adjusting the dose in&#xD;
      cohorts of 3 to 9 patients per three dose levels:20,000 IU/m2 (dose cohort -1), 25,000 IU/m2&#xD;
      (dose cohort 0), 30,000 IU/m2 (dose cohort +1). The goal is to determine the Recommended&#xD;
      Phase 2 Dose (RP2D)&#xD;
&#xD;
      For anti-leukemic activity:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the activity of Erwinaze to reduce the serum glutamine to the desired level, the&#xD;
      dose will be adjusted according to a pre-defined algorithm based on 48-hour trough serum&#xD;
      glutamine level (biochemical response) prior to dose 6 of each patient. If the safety profile&#xD;
      is acceptable, we will enroll up to a total of 15 patients at that dose level to better study&#xD;
      and analyze the glutamine-reducing effect of Erwinaze at the defined dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, if 9 patients are treated at a certain dose and at least 7 out of 9 individuals&#xD;
      respond to treatment (per serum glutamine levels) and &lt; 3 develop DLT, this dose level will&#xD;
      be declared the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D). Six additional patients (total of 15 to 18&#xD;
      patients) will be enrolled at the RP2D level to better assess toxicity and to document&#xD;
      responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no intra-patient dose escalation or reduction.&#xD;
