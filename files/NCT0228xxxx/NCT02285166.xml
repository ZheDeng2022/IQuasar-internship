  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this survey is to determine the incidence rate of cardiovascular (CV) events&#xD;
      associated with long-term treatment with and without omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters (Lotriga&#xD;
      Granular Capsules) in high-risk hyperlipidemic patients treated by statin in daily medical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This survey is planned to determine the incidence rate of cardiovascular (CV) events&#xD;
      associated with long-term treatment with omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters (Lotriga Granular&#xD;
      Capsules) in high-risk hyperlipidemic patients treated by statin in daily medical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence rate of CV events in the patients who are treated by the standard&#xD;
      anti-hyperlipidemic therapies other than Lotriga is investigated in this survey so as to&#xD;
      compare the events rates between two patients groups just for information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For adults, 2 g of omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters is usually administered orally once daily&#xD;
      immediately after meals. However, the dose can be increased up to twice daily (to a dose of 2&#xD;
      g) depending on patient's triglyceride (TG) level.&#xD;
