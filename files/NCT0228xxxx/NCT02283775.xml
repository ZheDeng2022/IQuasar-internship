      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: To evaluate the safety and determine the recommended dose of SAR650984 in combination&#xD;
      with pomalidomide (P) and dexamethasone (d), in patients with Relapsed/Refractory Multiple&#xD;
      Myeloma (RRMM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: To evaluate the feasibility of isatuximab administered from a fixed infusion volume&#xD;
      in combination with Pd as assessed by occurrence of grade ≥3 infusion associated reactions&#xD;
      (IAR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the infusion duration (Part B).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety profile of the combination with isatuximab administration from&#xD;
           fixed volume (Part B).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate immunogenicity of SAR650984 in combination with Pd (Part A and B).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of SAR650984 and its effect on the PK of&#xD;
           pomalidomide when administered in combination (Part A).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the efficacy of the combination of SAR650984 with Pd in terms of overall&#xD;
           response rate and clinical benefit rate based on International Myeloma Working Group&#xD;
           (IMWG) defined response criteria and the duration of response (Part A and B).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the relationship between clinical effects (adverse event [AE] and/or tumor&#xD;
           response) and CD38 receptor density at baseline (Part A).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study duration for an individual patient will include a screening period for inclusion of&#xD;
      up to 21 days. The treatment period may continue until disease progression, unacceptable&#xD;
      adverse reaction, or other reason for discontinuation. After study treatment discontinuation&#xD;
      an end of treatment (EOT) visit will be done at approximately 30 days after last study&#xD;
      treatment component administration to assess safety. If the last ADA sample is positive or&#xD;
      inconclusive, additional ADA will be sampled 3 months later. No further ADA will be sampled,&#xD;
      even if this 3-month sample is positive. Patients who discontinue treatment for reasons other&#xD;
      than progression of disease will be followed every month until progression or initiation of&#xD;
      subsequent therapy, for a maximum of one year, whichever comes first.&#xD;
