      This is an open label comparative study of tenofovir gel and film in 10 healthy sexually&#xD;
      active women without active female genital tract disorders. The women will receive a single&#xD;
      dose of each formulation - tenofovir gel (1%;equivalent to 40 mg in 4ml's of gel) and&#xD;
      tenofovir film (1.3%;40 mg) - in a crossover study design to determine the pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      of tenofovir in the blood, cervical tissue, and cervicovaginal fluid (primary objective).&#xD;

      This is an open label comparative study of tenofovir gel and film in 10 healthy sexually&#xD;
      active women without active female genital tract disorders. The women will receive a single&#xD;
      dose of each formulation - tenofovir gel (1%;equivalent to 40 mg in 4ml's of gel) and&#xD;
      tenofovir film (1.3%;40 mg) - in a crossover study design to determine the pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      of tenofovir in the blood, cervical tissue, and cervicovaginal fluid (primary objective).&#xD;
      Further, pharmacodynamics will be assessed using cervical tissue in an ex vivo HIV biopsy&#xD;
      challenge, and safety will be determined by assessment of adverse events following a single&#xD;
      dose of each formulation (secondary objective). The primary endpoint will be to determine&#xD;
      concentrations of tenofovir (TFV) and its metabolite, tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP), in&#xD;
      plasma, tissue homogenates, and cervicovaginal fluid. Secondary endpoints will be determined&#xD;
      by assessing concentrations of HIV p24 protein from explant aliquot samples up to 21 days&#xD;
      post-infection ex vivo, and by determination of Grade 2 or higher adverse events deemed&#xD;
      related to study product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research participants will receive the first tenofovir dose formulation prior to the&#xD;
      following sampling:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood PK plasma collection will be obtained at pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8 and 12 hours&#xD;
           (Day 0), 24 hours (Day 1); 48 hours (Day 2); 72 hours (Day 3); and 168 hours (Day 7)&#xD;
           following tenofovir formulation dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cervicovaginal fluid sampling, rectal fluid sampling, and cervicovaginal biopsy will be&#xD;
           performed (in the sequence listed) 5 and 72 hours after dosing in all subjects.&#xD;
           Cervicovaginal fluid and rectal fluid sampling will also be obtained at 168 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be counseled to abstain from sexual intercourse and all other insertive vaginal&#xD;
      practices for 10 days following each administered dose (or 7 days after the last&#xD;
      cervicovaginal sampling at 72 hours). Following a safety evaluation visit, the research&#xD;
      participant will return to the research unit and receive a second tenofovir dose formulation&#xD;
      followed by the same schedule of sample collection and a final safety visit. PK parameters of&#xD;
      TFV and TFV-DP will be estimated and compared between the gel and film formulations. PK&#xD;
      parameters will include peak concentration (Cmax), area under the concentration-time curve&#xD;
      (AUC), time to peak concentration (Tmax), elimination half-life (t1/2). Tenofovir gel and&#xD;
      film ex vivo pharmacodynamics will also be assessed and analyzed for correspondence to&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics.&#xD;

      These studies will be carried out at The Johns Hopkins Hospital under the direction of Craig&#xD;
      Hendrix, MD, as the Project PI.&#xD;
