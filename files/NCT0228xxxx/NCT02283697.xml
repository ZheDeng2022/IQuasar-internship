  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High salt diet increases risk of development of hypertension. In hypertensive patients, low&#xD;
      salt diet decreases blood pressure. Not surprisingly public health authorities endorse low&#xD;
      salt diet in hypertensive patients. But, surprisingly, average salt intake among adults in&#xD;
      Canada remains stubbornly high. Low effectiveness of &quot;fast counselling&quot; by physicians and&#xD;
      nurses on dietary salt is partly the culprit. Methods used in successful clinical trials (eg.&#xD;
      provision of meals, community cooking sessions, many hours of counselling by dieticians)&#xD;
      cannot be used in routine clinical practice. Hence the investigators propose a study on a&#xD;
      pragmatic dietary counselling method suitable for clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertensive patients will be randomized to receive standard care (which includes counselling&#xD;
      by the usual healthcare team, including doctors and nurses) or to receive additional&#xD;
      counselling from a registered dietician. This counselling will include two components: a one&#xD;
      hour counselling session, and 4, once-weekly telephone calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effectiveness of this counselling will be measured by checking sodium in the urine from a 24&#xD;
      hour collection (which is a measure of dietary salt intake) at baseline and at 4 weeks. In&#xD;
      addition, the investigators will also measure urinary sodium at 1 year, to assess if this&#xD;
      effect of counselling persists over a longer time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a pragmatic clinical trial, to test if additional counseling provided by a&#xD;
      dietician results in a reduction in dietary sodium intake as compared to usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that additional individualized and focused counseling provided by a&#xD;
      dietician will result in true change in dietary habits which will result in reduction of&#xD;
      dietary salt intake at 4 weeks. Usual care has been shown in the past to be ineffective in&#xD;
      actual reduction in dietary salt intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current model of treatment of hypertension, no funding is available for this&#xD;
      additional counseling. Also, usual care has been shown to be ineffective in reducing salt&#xD;
      intake. If positive, this study will help make the case for provision of dietary counseling,&#xD;
      which can be made to funding bodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective, open-label with blinded endpoints, randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention: One focused dietary counseling session, one hour long, with a registered&#xD;
      dietician. In addition, this will be followed by four, once-weekly phone calls to provide&#xD;
      reinforcement, and provide advice and support. This will be additional to usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will receive usual care, which is advice provided during their clinic visit&#xD;
      by the hypertension specialists clinic registered nurses and hypertension specialist&#xD;
      physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will have additional measurements as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline, 4 week and 12 month measurement of 24 hour urinary sodium and potassium&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline, 4 week and 12 month measurement of 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure&#xD;
           monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization process will consist of a computer generated random listing of the&#xD;
      treatment allocations in variable permuted blocks of 4 and 6 with concealment of allocation.&#xD;
      Though blinding of the patients is not possible for a behavioral intervention such as this,&#xD;
      the assessment of the outcome, which is an objective measurement, will be done in a blinded&#xD;
      fashion. All the study personnel collating and analyzing this data will be blinded to the&#xD;
      treatment assignment. In addition, the lab personnel who will be measuring the urinary sodium&#xD;
      (which is the primary outcome) will be blinded to treatment assignment.&#xD;
