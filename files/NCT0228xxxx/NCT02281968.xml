    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate if it is possible to decrease opioid consumption&#xD;
      in patients undergoing ankle fracture surgery by providing scheduled doses of nonsteroidal&#xD;
      inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo&#xD;
      controlled study with two groups of patients: one getting NSAIDs to take at regularly&#xD;
      scheduled times plus a traditional prescription for opioid medication and one receiving the&#xD;
      traditional prescription for opioid medication and a placebo. Patients will be assigned to a&#xD;
      group from a computer-generated program. Neither the patients nor their doctors or nurses&#xD;
      will know what group they are in, only the pharmacist will have that information. Patients in&#xD;
      both groups will have the opportunity to take opioid medications if the pain becomes&#xD;
      unmanageable.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Opioid abuse is rampant, can have bad consequences, and is a source of many&#xD;
      individual and societal problems. Although its use fulfills a role in pain control, this&#xD;
      investigation seeks to find a pain control alternative with the potential for fewer adverse&#xD;
      consequences for patient undergoing surgery for ankle fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: A structured regimen of NSAIDs (drugs such as ibuprofen or naproxen) during and&#xD;
      after ankle fracture surgery will provide adequate pain relief and cause patients to take&#xD;
      fewer doses of opioid drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This will be a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled study of&#xD;
      patients with ankle fractures who require surgical treatment by several NSLIJ orthopaedic&#xD;
      surgeons at North Shore University Hospital and Long Island Jewish Medical Center. There will&#xD;
      be two groups of patients: one getting NSAIDs to take at regularly scheduled times plus a&#xD;
      traditional prescription for opioid medication and one receiving the traditional prescription&#xD;
      for opioid medication and a placebo. Patients will be assigned to a group from a&#xD;
      computer-generated program. Neither the patients nor their doctors or nurses will know what&#xD;
      group they are in, only the pharmacist will have that information. Patients in both groups&#xD;
      will have the opportunity to take opioid medications if the pain becomes unmanageable. We are&#xD;
      evaluating whether patients in the NSAIDs group will a) have no more pain than patients who&#xD;
      are prescribed opioid pain killers for the same surgery and b) if the amount of opioid pain&#xD;
      killers can be reduced by having patients take scheduled doses of NSAIDs. We will also&#xD;
      describe how well or poorly patients heal, looking at several timepoints after surgery, using&#xD;
      Xrays to evaluate formation of new bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test (experimental) group will be given a dose of IV (intravenous) ketorolac, which is an&#xD;
      NSAID, during surgery, and will be given naproxen 500mg orally two times per day to take on a&#xD;
      regular basis after surgery for four weeks. This group will be given percocet 5/325 (an&#xD;
      opioid medication) 1-2 pills orally every 4 hours to take as pain medication if the naproxen&#xD;
      is not providing adequate pain relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will be administered a saline dose during surgery as an equivalent to the&#xD;
      IV ketorolac. These patients will take placebo pain pills on a regular basis two times per&#xD;
      day for four weeks, and will take percocet for pain relief. This is equivalent to the common&#xD;
      pain protocol that is given to patients after ankle fracture surgery, where they are given&#xD;
      percocet to be taken on an as-needed basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The placebo and naproxen medication will be in unidentifiable capsule form in unmarked&#xD;
      bottles. The maximum daily dose of percocet will be 8 pills, so as not to exceed 2.6g&#xD;
      acetaminophen daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will take aspirin (ASA) 325mg orally daily for two weeks to prevent blood clots.&#xD;
      All patients will take pantoprazole 40mg orally once daily. Pantoprazole is a proton pump&#xD;
      inhibitor (PPI) that suppresses the production of stomach acid, to prevent the development of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will collect demographic data about the patients. We will also collect data about the&#xD;
      surgery: surgery time, treating surgeon, type of surgery, location and complexity of&#xD;
      fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      W are studying the following outcomes: pain relief, opioid use and bone healing. To measure&#xD;
      these outcomes, we will use a pain scale called the VAS to look for differences between the&#xD;
      group. A change of 10 millimeters on a scale of 100 millimeters will considered to be the&#xD;
      important pain difference. We will also ask patients to fill out journals of their medication&#xD;
      use, we will perform pill counts, examine Xrays and ask patients to respond to the FFI, a&#xD;
      questionnaire to evaluate how well they are functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be seen for followup at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 2 months, 6 months, and 1 year after&#xD;
      surgery, all but the last visit are the usual and standard visits scheduled after ankle&#xD;
      fracture surgery. At each visit, Xrays will be taken of the ankle to evaluate ankle position,&#xD;
      and to determine whether bone healing has occurred. Patients will not incur any extra expense&#xD;
      as a result of participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since patients will not know which group they have been assigned to -- test (experimental) or&#xD;
      control -- the investigators will carefully explain how to determine the need for taking the&#xD;
      prescribed opioid pain medication such that patients are not subjected to unnecessary pain.&#xD;
      Since both groups will have access to opioid pain medications, the study is designed to&#xD;
      determine if those patients in the NSAIDs group already getting the relief from pain will&#xD;
      experience pain at lower levels, which we will only be able to determine after the study is&#xD;
      completed and the blind is broken.&#xD;
