    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to confirm the TAF dose and to evaluate the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of TAF, safety, and tolerability of F/TAF in HIV-1 infected children&#xD;
      and adolescents virologically suppressed (defined as having &lt; 50 copies/mL of HIV-1&#xD;
      ribonucleic acid [RNA] for a period of at least 6 months) while on a stable NRTI containing&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cohorts 2, 3, and 4 will be on a boosted protease inhibitor (PI) or any other 3rd&#xD;
      antiretroviral (ARV) agent and will switch their current 2-NRTI-containing regimen to&#xD;
      open-label F/TAF while continuing their boosted PI or 3rd agent through 48 weeks. A minimum&#xD;
      of 10 participants each in Groups 1 and 2 of Cohort 2, and Cohorts 3 and 4, who are on&#xD;
      boosted-atazanavir (ATV) as their 3rd ARV agent will be enrolled. Participants in Cohort 2,&#xD;
      Group 1 receive boosted PI agents only. Cohorts 2, 3, and 4 will be enrolled by cohort into a&#xD;
      two-part study (Parts A and B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of 48 weeks, all participants will be given the option to participate in an&#xD;
      extension phase of the study. Gilead will provide F/TAF until a) The participant turns 18&#xD;
      years old and F/TAF is commercially available for use in adults in the country in which the&#xD;
      participant is enrolled or b), F/TAF becomes commercially available for pediatric use in the&#xD;
      country in which the participant is enrolled or c), Gilead Sciences elects to terminate&#xD;
      development of F/TAF in the applicable country.&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants were enrolled at study sites in Panama, South Africa, and United States. The first participant was screened on 20 January 2015.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants will not be enrolled in Cohort 2 (Group 1 and 2 in Part B), Cohorts 3 and 4 (Parts A and B). The last Week 48 study visit for participants in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, Group 1 and Group 2 in Part A occurred on 13 December 2019.&#xD;
It was prespecified to analyze data from Cohort 1 together because both treatments (F/TAF 200/10 mg with boosted 3rd ARV and F/TAF 200/25 mg with unboosted 3rd ARV) were expected to have a similar effect on the efficacy and safety for the target population.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Experiencing Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) Through Week 24</title>
        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. The TEAEs were defined as any AEs with an onset date of on or after the study drug start date and no later than 30 days after permanent discontinuation of study drug or any AEs leading to premature discontinuation of study drug.</description>

        <population>The Safety Analysis Set included all participants who were enrolled in the study and had received at least one dose of study medication. It was prespecified to analyze data from Cohort 1 together because both treatments (F/TAF 200/10 mg with boosted 3rd ARV and F/TAF 200/25 mg with unboosted 3rd ARV) were expected to have a similar effect on the efficacy and safety for the target population.</population>

          <title>Percentage of Participants Experiencing Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) Through Week 24</title>
          <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. The TEAEs were defined as any AEs with an onset date of on or after the study drug start date and no later than 30 days after permanent discontinuation of study drug or any AEs leading to premature discontinuation of study drug.</description>
          <population>The Safety Analysis Set included all participants who were enrolled in the study and had received at least one dose of study medication. It was prespecified to analyze data from Cohort 1 together because both treatments (F/TAF 200/10 mg with boosted 3rd ARV and F/TAF 200/25 mg with unboosted 3rd ARV) were expected to have a similar effect on the efficacy and safety for the target population.</population>
