  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of immune&#xD;
      cells called natural killer (NK) cells that can be given with chemotherapy to patients with&#xD;
      CLL. Researchers want to learn if adding NK cells will be effective in treating the disease.&#xD;
      The safety of this will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NK cells may kill cancer cells that remain in your body after your last chemotherapy&#xD;
      treatment. The NK cells will be separated from umbilical cord blood. The device used in the&#xD;
      laboratory to separate the NK cells is called a CliniMACS. These separated NK cells will then&#xD;
      be grown in the lab to increase the number of NK cells that can be given to you by vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Rituximab, fludarabine, and cyclophosphamide are FDA&#xD;
      approved and commercially available for the treatment of CLL. Cytarabine, filgrastim, and&#xD;
      lenalidomide are FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of other types of&#xD;
      cancer. The use of cytarabine, filgrastim, and lenalidomide for the treatment of CLL is&#xD;
      investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of NK cells is investigational. The NK cell process is not FDA approved or&#xD;
      commercially available. It is currently being used for research purposes only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 44 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

      Central Venous Catheter:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chemotherapy, some of the other drugs in this study, and the NK cells will be given by&#xD;
      vein through your central venous catheter (CVC). A CVC is a sterile flexible tube and needle&#xD;
      that will be placed into a large vein while you are under local anesthesia. Blood samples&#xD;
      will also be drawn through your CVC. The CVC will remain in your body during treatment. Your&#xD;
      doctor will explain this procedure to you in more detail, and you will be required to sign a&#xD;
      separate consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NK Cell Dose Levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be assigned to a dose level of NK cells based on when you joined this study. Up to 5&#xD;
      dose levels of NK cells will be tested. The first group of participants will receive the&#xD;
      lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no&#xD;
      intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of NK&#xD;
      cells is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If not enough NK cells can be produced in the laboratory for your assigned dose level, you&#xD;
      will still receive the NK cells that were produced. If you are infused with a lower number of&#xD;
      NK cells than had been originally planned, the CLL may not respond. Researchers do not know&#xD;
      what number of NK cells is needed for a response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy and NK Cell infusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The days before you receive the NK cells are called minus days. The day you receive the NK&#xD;
      cells is called Day 0. The days after you receive the NK cells are called plus days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive 1 of 3 study drug plans. Your doctor will decide which plan you will receive&#xD;
      based on your age, prior treatment, diagnosis, and health status. You will receive 1 of the 3&#xD;
      options as explained below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Option #1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day -2 through Day +14, you will take lenalidomide by mouth once a day at about the same&#xD;
      time each day. If you are able to do so, you will take aspirin or another drug as instructed&#xD;
      by your doctor on these days to help prevent blood clots. You will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      study drug diary and bring it to each study visit. The study staff will tell you more about&#xD;
      this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day -5, you will receive fludarabine by vein over 1 hour and cyclophosphamide by vein over&#xD;
      3 hours. If you have a B-cell cancer, you will receive rituximab by vein over 3-6 hours.&#xD;
      Rituximab and fludarabine are given to treat the cancer and lower the immune system in order&#xD;
      to lower the risk of the body rejecting the NK cells. Cyclophosphamide is given to lower the&#xD;
      immune system in order to lower the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD -- when&#xD;
      transplanted immune tissue, such as cord blood NK cells, attacks the tissues of the&#xD;
      recipient's body).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day -4 and -3, you will receive fludarabine by vein over 1 hour and cyclophosphamide by&#xD;
      vein over 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days -2 and -1, you will rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 0, you will receive NK cells by vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Option #2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day -2 through Day +14, you will take lenalidomide by mouth once a day at about the same&#xD;
      time each day. If you are able to do so, you will take aspirin or another drug as instructed&#xD;
      by your doctor on these days to help prevent blood clots. You will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      study drug diary and bring it to each study visit. The study staff will tell you more about&#xD;
      this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day -6, you will receive fludarabine by vein over 1 hour. Fludarabine is given to treat&#xD;
      the cancer and lower the immune system in order to lower the risk of the body rejecting the&#xD;
      NK cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day -5, and -4, you will receive fludarabine by vein over 1 hour and cyclophosphamide by&#xD;
      vein over 3 hours. Cyclophosphamide is given to lower the immune system in order to lower the&#xD;
      risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD -- when transplanted immune tissue, such as cord&#xD;
      blood NK cells, attacks the tissues of the recipient's body).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day -3 and -2, you will receive fludarabine by vein over 1 hour. Fludarabine is given to&#xD;
      treat the cancer and lower the immune system in order to lower the risk of the body rejecting&#xD;
      the NK cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day -1, you will rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 0, you will receive NK cells by vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Option #3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day -7, you be given fluids by vein to hydrate you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days -6 through - 2, you will receive fludarabine by vein over 1 hour and cytarabine by&#xD;
      vein over 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day -2 through Day +14, you will take lenalidomide by mouth once a day at about the same&#xD;
      time each day. If you are able to do so, you will take aspirin or another drug as instructed&#xD;
      by your doctor on these days to help prevent blood clots. You will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      study drug diary and bring it to each study visit. The study staff will tell you more about&#xD;
      this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day -1, you will rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 0, you will receive NK cells by vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting on Day +5, you will receive filgrastim as an injection under the skin 1 time a day&#xD;
      until your blood cell levels return to normal. Filgrastim is designed to help with the growth&#xD;
      of white blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 7 days before starting chemotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 2 days and then about 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, and 4&#xD;
      months after the NK cell infusion, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Â°Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, tests to measure levels of&#xD;
      certain proteins, to learn how your body's immune system responds to the NK cell infusion,&#xD;
      and to check the level of the NK cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 1 week, 3 weeks, 1 month, and 4 months after the NK cell infusion, you will have a bone&#xD;
      marrow biopsy/aspiration to check the status of the disease. To collect a bone marrow&#xD;
      biopsy/aspirate, an area of the hip or chest bone is numbed with anesthetic, and a small&#xD;
      amount of bone and bone marrow is withdrawn through a large needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon each time) will be drawn for a pregnancy&#xD;
      test within 10-14 days and 24 hours before you are prescribed lenalidomide, at about Day +21,&#xD;
      at 2 months after NK cell infusion, and then again 4 weeks after therapy is stopped. To&#xD;
      continue on this study, you must not be pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If possible, the blood needed for pregnancy tests will be collected during the above blood&#xD;
      draws so that no additional needle sticks will be needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be on study for up to about 1 year. You may be taken off study early if the disease&#xD;
      gets worse, if you are unable to receive the NK cell infusion, if you have any intolerable&#xD;
      side effects, if you are unable to follow study directions, if your doctor thinks it is in&#xD;
      your best interest, if the study is stopped, or if you choose to leave the study early.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You should talk to the study doctor if you want to leave the study early. If you are taken&#xD;
      off study early, you still may need to return for routine post-transplant follow-up visits,&#xD;
      if your doctor decides it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are thinking about dropping out of this study, please tell the study doctor. The&#xD;
      doctor can tell you about the effects of stopping treatment. You and the doctor can talk&#xD;
      about what follow-up care and testing would help you the most.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you leave the study, your test results and information cannot be removed from the study&#xD;
      records.&#xD;
