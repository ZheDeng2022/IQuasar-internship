      This study aims to evaluate the effect of stimulation of prefrontal regions on language&#xD;
      performance (e.g. word translation and picture naming).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the language tests, cortical activity will be registered using electroencephalography&#xD;
      (EEG) which will provide supplementary information about the cerebral processus involved in&#xD;
      language production and management of two languages in bilingual subjects.&#xD;

      Effect of stimulation of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex on language production in healthy&#xD;
      bilinguals&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Language relies on two main neurocognitive components; a dedicated language network depending&#xD;
      on perisylvian structures, and a domain-general control-executive and working memory system&#xD;
      relying on prefrontal, particularly left cingulum and dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)&#xD;
      networks. The executive system is known to participate in language control in bilinguals, but&#xD;
      also plays a role in many intra-languages processing, for mother language (L1) and even more&#xD;
      in second language production (L2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anodal-tDCS appears to improve cognitive functions (e.g. working memory, complex verbal&#xD;
      problem-solving, inhibition) in adults. Despite the fact that the contribution of executive&#xD;
      function in language processing in monolingual and multilingual speakers is crucial, it has&#xD;
      not received considerable attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to demonstrate the impact of the modulation of executive functions,&#xD;
      particularly subserved by DLPFC, on language production in healthy bilingual. The&#xD;
      investigators propose that such impact will be particularly present in L2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental task will test the impact of prefrontal stimulation by tDCS (Anodal compared&#xD;
      to Sham) over left DLPFC of healthy adult bilingual subjects during two tasks relying on&#xD;
      lexical strategies: a picture naming task in L1 and L2 and a word translation task. The EEG&#xD;
      correlates of these tasks performed following tDCS will be analysed, which allows us to&#xD;
      investigate precisely the spatiotemporal brain dynamics underlying the behavioural&#xD;
      modifications induced by the modulation of left frontal areas. The hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A-tDCS-induced left DLPFC activation will increase performance particularly in L2 naming&#xD;
           and in the translation task versus baseline performances (sham tDCS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A-tDCS is expected to modify the cortical activity related to the language tasks. During&#xD;
           naming, EEG analyses will show a main effect of stimulation and an interaction between&#xD;
           the factors Language (L1 or L2) and Stimulation (sham, anodal) at the topographic level,&#xD;
           showing an effect of prefrontal areas larger in L2 than L1. The latency of the ERP&#xD;
           modulation by tDCS in L2 will allow us to target the dynamics and the language planning&#xD;
           processes underlying improved naming performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental task will include healthy L1-L2 unbalanced subjects. The investigators will&#xD;
      analyse the influence of the DLPFC stimulation on naming and translation ability using tDCS&#xD;
      as well as their EEG correlates in L1 and L2. The prediction is that left prefrontal&#xD;
      Anodal-stimulation will increase language performances particularly in L2. EEG analyses will&#xD;
      unravel the spatio-temporal dynamics of executive processes involved in the two tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG EEG is a direct non-invasive technique for recording of the electrical activity produced&#xD;
      by neurons over the scalp with a high temporal resolution. EEG recording is obtained by&#xD;
      placing electrodes on the scalp. The event-related potentials will be processed/analysed&#xD;
      offline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      tDCS TDCS is an affordable and safe method of brain stimulation which can be broadly used in&#xD;
      general population. In tDCS, the cerebral cortex is stimulated through a weak constant&#xD;
      electric current (1-2 mA) through two electrodes (35 cm2 and 70cm2, an &quot;active&quot; electrode&#xD;
      which targets a special region of brain and a &quot;return&quot; electrode). This weak current can&#xD;
      induce focal changes of cortical excitability that lasts beyond the period of stimulation. In&#xD;
      general, Anodal stimulation (A-tDCS) is supposed to depolarize neurons leading to an increase&#xD;
      in excitability, whereas Cathodal stimulation (C-tDCS) has the opposite effect compared to&#xD;
      sham. Sham tDCS (S-tDCS) refers to a control condition in which the subject will receive a&#xD;
      brief current but then the stimulator remains off for the rest of the stimulation time. In&#xD;
      this way, the individuals receiving the S-tDCS are not aware that they are not receiving&#xD;
      prolonged stimulation.The mechanisms of tDCS effect are classified into synaptic (changes by&#xD;
      altering the strength of synaptic transmission) and non-synaptic (shifts in resting membrane&#xD;
      potential of pre and post-synaptic neurons).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Language proficiency assessment To assess language immersion, participants will be asked for&#xD;
      the age of acquisition, how long they lived in a region where French and English language was&#xD;
      spoken, the language spoken in family, in childhood, in current daily life, and if the&#xD;
      language was acquired in or out of school. In the self-evaluation part, participants will&#xD;
      indicate in an analogue scale from 1 to 100% how they estimate their reading, speaking,&#xD;
      comprehension and writing skills. Moreover, a sub-test from the computer-based DIALANG&#xD;
      language diagnosis system will be used to evaluate reading performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure This study consists of two sessions, each one week apart, in a counterbalanced&#xD;
      order: 1. Anodal A-tDCS, 2. Sham-tDCS. In both sessions, the same evaluations/tasks will be&#xD;
      used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A-tDCS intervention: The active anodal electrode is placed over DLPFC and the return&#xD;
           electrode over contralateral supraorbital area. A 1.5mA direct current will flows&#xD;
           between the electrodes for 20 minutes. To decrease current-induced injuries, at the&#xD;
           beginning of stimulation, the current reaches from 0 to 1.5mA through 30 seconds&#xD;
           (fade-in), and at the end will decrease from 1.5mA to 0 in 15 seconds (fade-out).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sham-tDCS intervention: The parameters mimics the A-tDCS (i.e. electrode placement,&#xD;
           fade-in and current intensity), except the duration of the stimulation: the current will&#xD;
           reach to 1.5mA in 30 seconds (fade-in) and lasts only for 30 seconds (to give the&#xD;
           initial sensation of stimulation) then decreases to 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two language contexts will be presented within each of the two sessions in a&#xD;
      counterbalanced order across subjects. At the beginning of each language context session, a&#xD;
      short text written in the corresponding language will be showed to the subject in order to&#xD;
      activate the language of interest. Participants will be seated in an electrically shielded&#xD;
      and sound attenuated booth in front of a LCD screen. Stimulus delivery and response recording&#xD;
      are controlled using E-Prime 2.0. The stimuli will be presented in the center of the screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stimuli and tasks Verbal and non-verbal fluency tasks, without EEG recording At minute 15/20&#xD;
      of tDCS, a verbal fluency task in L1 will be done (the subject will be asked to name as many&#xD;
      words as he/she can which starts with a certain letter during 1 minute). At 16/20 minutes, a&#xD;
      non-verbal fluency task (5 points test, i.e. a sheet of paper with 40 squares of fixed&#xD;
      symmetrically arranged points (5 points) will be presented to the participant. The&#xD;
      participant will be asked to produce as many different figures as possible with connecting&#xD;
      the dots with at least one line connecting two dots during 2 minutes). And at minute 18/20, a&#xD;
      verbal fluency in L2 will be done during 1 minute (according to Nitsche and Paulus the effect&#xD;
      of tDCS reaches maximum at 4/20 minutes of stimulation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Naming task in L1 and L2 during EEG measures The naming task will be done based on a corpus&#xD;
      of 70 pictures, the corresponding words being matched in English and French on pertinent&#xD;
      psycholinguistic factors. The stimuli consist of black and white line drawings (of 8.5 x&#xD;
      8.5cm each) representing manufactured objects (tools, furniture, clothes, kitchen objects,&#xD;
      electric apparatus, vehicles etc.) or living objects, selected from the Snodgrass and&#xD;
      Vanderwart image bank according to lexical and pre-lexical norms and databases. The naming&#xD;
      task consists of 2 blocks, one in L1 and one in L2 (each block with 70 images) with a&#xD;
      2-minute pause between the two blocks. The order of blocks will be counterbalanced. In each&#xD;
      trial, an image will be presented centrally (1000 ms) after a fixation cross of 300 ms. The&#xD;
      subject then will have maximum 2000 ms to name the object.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Translation task to L1 and L2 during EEG measurement Then, they will performed an offline&#xD;
      task consisting in translating during 8 minutes 100 words (5 letters length) from L1 to their&#xD;
      second language (L2) or vice versa. Both senses of translation will be mixed randomly to&#xD;
      increase working memory load. Translation corpus consists of 50 words in each language,&#xD;
      matched across L1 and L2 on frequency, length in syllables and phonemes. Words will be&#xD;
      presented on the screen and the subject will be asked to translate each word in the other&#xD;
      language. The words will be presented 1500 ms on the screen after a fixation cross of 300ms.&#xD;
      The subject will have a maximum 2500ms to do the translation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioural and EEG analyses Behavioural analysis A first behavioural analysis will compare&#xD;
      naming and translation performances, as well as speech onset latencies in both languages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be conducted according to 2X2 experimental designs with Language&#xD;
      (L1; L2) and Stimulation (Anodal, Sham) as within-subject factors. The investigators main&#xD;
      interest will be the interaction term between Language and Stimulation. The investigators&#xD;
      expect the interaction to be driven by the left DLPFC stimulation with A-tDCS improving&#xD;
      performance in L2 but not L1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Event Related Potentials (ERP) analyses ERPs will be analyzed using a step-wise procedure&#xD;
      that permits the time-wise, multifactorial statistical assessment of (1) the dynamic changes&#xD;
      of scalp-recorded electric field configuration and their temporal segmentation into&#xD;
      quasi-stable functional micro-states indexing modulations of the configuration of&#xD;
      intracranial generators, (2) global electric field power indexing modulation of response&#xD;
      strength of the intracranial generators, (3) intracranial distributed linear electrical&#xD;
      source estimations. These analyses will be conducted for each time frame of the whole ERP&#xD;
      time-period; however, specific time windows are planned to be sensitive to the investigators&#xD;
      factors according to meta-analyses and the investigators previous results: lexical selection&#xD;
      is thought to occurs between 170 and 270 ms after picture presentation, so there will be a&#xD;
      first time window until 200 ms, a second time window between 200 and 300 ms, and a later time&#xD;
      window (300-450 ms) corresponding to lexical-phonological encoding in previous studies. The&#xD;
      main effect will be L1 and L2 patterns in term of amplitude, duration and sequences. Then, a&#xD;
      second main effect will be the anodal tDCS / sham tDCS effect in an early time window before&#xD;
      the vocalization will start. The investigators will expect an interaction between language&#xD;
      and stimulation, due to the fact that left DLPFC anodal-tDCS will modulate L2 more than&#xD;
