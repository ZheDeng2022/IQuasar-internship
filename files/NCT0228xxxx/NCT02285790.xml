  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common cancer diagnosed in white populations&#xD;
      worldwide. The rising incidence of BCCs is becoming a major worldwide public health problem&#xD;
      (1,11). Between 1973 and 2009, the European standardized rate quadrupled from 40 to 165 per&#xD;
      100,000 person-years for men and from 34 to 157 for women, most probably as a result of more&#xD;
      intensive UV exposure (12). This is supported by previous published epidemiological&#xD;
      literature indicating that ultraviolet radiation is an important risk factor for BCC with a&#xD;
      significant increase among outdoor workers (13,14). Despite the low mortality from BCC,&#xD;
      multiple and recurring tumors confer a high morbidity and considerable burden for health care&#xD;
      providers and health budgets. Although BCC does not seem to have a high effect on patients'&#xD;
      quality of life, patients suffering from BCC are definitely interested in efficacy, low&#xD;
      recurrence rates and cosmetic outcome of their therapies.(15). Meanwhile resources available&#xD;
      at hospitals have not increased proportionally and therefore optimizing effectiveness of&#xD;
      present treatment modalities in daily dermatologic practice is mandatory (16).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically, BCC are characterized by small, translucent, or pearly papules, with raised&#xD;
      teleangiectatic edges (17) . Most of the BCC occur in sun-exposed skin of the head and neck&#xD;
      area (18,19). Sensitivity and positive predictive value for the clinical diagnosing of BCC by&#xD;
      dermatologists has been reported to be 95.4% and 85.9%, respectively (20). However, dividing&#xD;
      between BCC subtypes is not always possible upon clinical assessment. To date, histological&#xD;
      analysis of punch biopsy remains the golden standard to confirm the clinical diagnosis of&#xD;
      BCCs and dividing between the following subtypes: nodular (nBCC), micronodular (mnBCC),&#xD;
      infiltrating (iBCC) and superficial (sBCC) (10). Of those, nBCC and sBCC have a less&#xD;
      aggressive growth pattern in comparison to mnBCC and iBCC. Additionally, mixed type BCC&#xD;
      (mtBCC) can be defined as a combination of subtypes and are frequently composed of aggressive&#xD;
      subtypes (21). Surgical excision remains the standard of treatment, with Mohs micrographic&#xD;
      surgery typically utilized for high-risk lesions (22). Based upon the histological growth&#xD;
      pattern, BCC are surgically removed with a margin of either 3mm (nBCC and sBCC) or 5mm&#xD;
      (mnBCC, iBCC) in accordance with current Dutch guidelines (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the rising incidence of BCC there is a need for more efficient, non-invasive methods&#xD;
      to diagnose BCCs. The use of real-time in vivo reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) to&#xD;
      diagnose BCCs has proven successful to address this need. Various studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      that RCM is safe and accurate (sensitivity and specificity) to diagnose BCCs(2-6). Reported&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity for RCM in diagnosing BCC range from 83%-100% and 79%-97%,&#xD;
      respectively (7). Furthermore, Peppelman et al. and Longo et al. recently reported on RCM&#xD;
      features that might divide between nodular, micronodular, superficial and infiltrative&#xD;
      subtypes of BCC (8,9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2012, van der Geer et al reported on the feasibility of a one-stop-shop (OSS) concept for&#xD;
      the treatment of skin cancer patients (23). One-stop-shop implies that at the day of the&#xD;
      initial outpatient clinic consultation, diagnosis and treatment plan both take place. In&#xD;
      their study, pre-operative frozen section histology was used to confirm BCC diagnosis and&#xD;
      subtype. The mean throughput time was 4 hours and 7 min, no complications were observed, and&#xD;
      patient satisfaction was high (23). Incorporating RCM as non-invasive diagnostic tool in a&#xD;
      BCC OSS concept for lesions suitable for conventional surgical excision might further reduce&#xD;
      time between clinical diagnosis and treatment, administrative workload and costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to assess the efficacy and safety of the one-stop-shop concept, using&#xD;
      real-time in vivo reflectance confocal microscopy (Vivascope 1500; Lucid Technologies,&#xD;
      Henrietta, NY, USA) as diagnostic tool, prior to surgical management of new primary BCCs, of&#xD;
      all subtypes, in the general population.&#xD;

    <description>The Vivascope 1500 will be used (CE certified, Lucid Technologies, Henrietta, NY, USA). Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging will be performed for intended use only and interpreted on the Vivascope workstation by two investigators independently at both study locations. The investigators will be blinded to the results of the reference standard. After RCM imaging subjects will receive OSS surgical excision according to subtype. Clinically suspected primary BCCs that are not confirmed by RCM will also receive surgical treatment with a margin of 3mm.</description>

    <description>Clinical suspected primary BCCs, of all subtypes, will be diagnosed by conventional 3mm punch biopsy of the most elevated part of the lesion. Punch biopsies will be performed under local anesthetics using 1% xylocaine/adrenaline. HE stained sections of the punch biopsies will be evaluated by an experienced board certified pathologist. Subjects will receive surgical excision according to subtype within 6 weeks after punch biopsy has been performed. Clinically suspected new primary BCCs that are not confirmed by punch biopsy will also receive surgical treatment with a margin of 3mm.</description>
