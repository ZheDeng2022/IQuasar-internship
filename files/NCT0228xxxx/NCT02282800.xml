  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was to intended to visualize the nuclear localization of vitamin D receptor in oral&#xD;
      tissues of aggressive periodontitis patients to better understand the potential for receptor&#xD;
      in disease activity or progression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aggressive periodontitis (AgP) is an infectious disease of the periodontium which affects&#xD;
      young adults, causing damage to the supporting apparatus of the teeth, leading to rapid bone&#xD;
      resorption and tooth loss. Its clinical features have been shown to result from several&#xD;
      genetic and environmental factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This has increased the interest to research those genetic host factors as they may provide&#xD;
      useful risk markers, reveal important information regarding the pathogenesis and also&#xD;
      identification of effective preventive agents that might help decrease the disease burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3,apart from these traditional calcium-related actions, this active&#xD;
      form is being increasingly recognized for its potent anti-proliferative, anti-differentiative&#xD;
      and immunomodulatory activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The calcitriol activity is largely mediated by the vitamin D receptor (VDR) whose expression&#xD;
      has been described in some tissues. VDR is localized in both the cytosol and nucleus and&#xD;
      accumulates in the nucleus in response to 1,25,dihydroxyvitamin D3 binding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expression and nuclear activation of the VDR are necessary for the effects of vitamin D.&#xD;
      Thus, alterations in the vitamin D pathway lead to disturbances in mineral metabolism. It may&#xD;
      be hypothesized that the rapid bone loss which occurs in aggressive periodontitis patients&#xD;
      may be due to decreased or absence of expression of Vitamin D receptor in the nucleus.&#xD;
