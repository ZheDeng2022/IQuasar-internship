  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many cancer patients experience their illness as substantial psychological burden. About half&#xD;
      of the cancer patients suffer from severe stress symptoms and around one third of the&#xD;
      patients fulfill the criteria for a clinically relevant psychological disorder (mainly&#xD;
      anxiety disorder and/or major depression). Studies show, that a high level of distress in&#xD;
      cancer patients is associated with more side effects of and a reduced compliance for&#xD;
      oncological treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, the efficacy of psycho-oncological interventions is well studied and proven. Besides&#xD;
      the reduction of levels of anxiety, distress and depression, psycho-oncological support&#xD;
      facilitates dealing with physical complaints and increases quality of life. Yet,&#xD;
      psycho-oncological support is rarely utilized by male patients and insufficiently accessible&#xD;
      for many patients (i.a. lack of supply in the respective area, cost issues).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The internet overcomes some of these barriers, as it can be used independently of time and&#xD;
      location. Internet-based therapies are therefore a growing field of interest in research and&#xD;
      there is evidence for treatment efficacy for several psychological disorders. Moreover effect&#xD;
      sizes of traditional face-to-face and interactive web-based interventions are comparable.&#xD;
      However, web-based interventions for cancer patients are still scarce. The present research&#xD;
      project therefore develops a comprehensive stress management program accessible for a vast&#xD;
      number of cancer patients. The study targets primarily to evaluate the feasibility of the&#xD;
      program (technical, organizational feasibility, accessibility). In addition, the preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of the program will be analyzed in order to adapt future programs for specific&#xD;
      patient groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study is designed as a randomized controlled wait-list intervention study. Within&#xD;
      12 weeks of the start of anti-cancer treatment, patients will be randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      web-based stress management intervention or a wait-list control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with any kind of newly diagnosed cancer undergoing first Treatment regardless of the&#xD;
      Setting. Patients undergoing first treatment for newly diagnosed relapse of cancer, who have&#xD;
      received prior curatively-intended Treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion is allowed immediately prior to or within 12 weeks of the start of treatment. If&#xD;
      surgery was performed initially and is followed by systemic treatment or radiotherapy, start&#xD;
      of systemic treatment or radiotherapy is counted as first treatment. Prior treatment&#xD;
      -including chemotherapy- for a different, prior malignant tumor is allowed. Concomitant&#xD;
      participation in an experimental therapeutic drug trial is allowed. Age &gt;18 years. Command of&#xD;
      the German language. Internet access and basic computer skills. Life expectancy of &gt;6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing second- or further line treatment. Patients treated with surgery only.&#xD;
      Patients participating in a concomitant psychological intervention trial&#xD;
