  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iodine deficiency remains widespread worldwide with children as among the vulnerable groups&#xD;
      considering their stage of growth and development. In the Philippines, current data shows an&#xD;
      optimal status among schoolchildren, however no data exists on iodine status nor intake of&#xD;
      preschool children. One recent approach to improvement of the vitamin and mineral status of&#xD;
      the population is home fortification using micronutrient powder or MNP. This contains 15&#xD;
      vitamins and minerals, including iodine and iron. Current guidelines exist for MNP use to&#xD;
      improve iron status and reduce anemia among infants and young children 6-23 months old, but&#xD;
      did not mention use among preschoolers such as those in day care centers. This study,&#xD;
      therefore, aims to compare the iodine status and growth of day care children given MNP for 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iodine is an essential trace element for normal growth and development in animals and man&#xD;
      (Hetzel, 1989). When iodine requirements are not met, thyroid hormone synthesis is impaired&#xD;
      resulting in hypothyroidism and a series of functional and development abnormalities called&#xD;
      iodine deficiency disorders or IDD develop (WHO, 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHO estimated that two billion people worldwide, including 1/3 of school-age children (de&#xD;
      Benoist et al. cited by Zimmerman, 2011) suffer from iodine deficiency. Evidence is lacking&#xD;
      as to whether schoolchildren are good proxy for other groups such as young children&#xD;
      (Sullivam, 2010). In the Philippines, no data exists on the iodine status of preschool&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One recent approach for improving the vitamin and mineral status of the population is the use&#xD;
      of micronutrient powder which contains 15 vitamins and minerals including iodine (HF-TAG&#xD;
      2011). While the MNP has been found effective to improve iron status, its effectiveness in&#xD;
      improving iodine status has yet to be studied. Further, the provision of iodine through MNPs&#xD;
      as well as the combined impact of salt iodization and use of MNPs, warrant investigation. It&#xD;
      would also be of interest to generate data on the knowledge, attitude and practices of their&#xD;
      parents or other caregiver who primarily take care of planning and provision of food for the&#xD;
      family on iodine, iodized salt and MNP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day care centers (DCC) are chosen as the site of the study considering their conduct of&#xD;
      120-days supplementary feeding yearly and the organized structure presents a better&#xD;
      compliance and easier monitoring of use. Further, the day care pupils, more or less,&#xD;
      represent the preschoolers in the barangay and there may be commonality (homogeneity) of the&#xD;
      children in age and other characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of guidelines for MNP use among children 24 months or older, the existing&#xD;
      guidelines such as 60 sachets in 6 months as stipulated in DOH AO 2011-0303 will be followed.&#xD;
