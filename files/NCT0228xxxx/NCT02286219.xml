      To evaluate the safety, tolerability, dose limiting toxicity (DLT), and maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD), of FS102(BMS-986186) when administered intravenously (IV) to subjects with&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory solid tumors that overexpress HER2 and who have no standard treatment&#xD;
      options.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, multiple dose escalation study in subjects with solid tumors&#xD;
      that over express HER2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with locally un-resectable and/or metastatic solid cancers that over express human&#xD;
      epidermal growth factor tyrosine kinase receptor 2 (HER2) by standard clinical pathology&#xD;
      criteria and who have no standard treatment options will be enrolled into a series of&#xD;
      escalating dose cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within each dose cohort, subjects will receive weekly (± 1 day) or less frequent IV (Q3W)&#xD;
      infusions of FS102 during an initial 28-day (4-week) DLT observation period. During the DLT&#xD;
      observation period, subjects will be assessed for safety, tolerability, dose limiting&#xD;
      toxicity, PK, immunogenicity, and clinical disease response. Following assessment by the&#xD;
      Investigator, subjects without clinical disease progression and without unacceptable toxicity&#xD;
      will be eligible to continue receiving FS102 for up to six 21 (Q3W) to 28-day (weekly)&#xD;
      cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuation Phase. Subjects who complete six 21-28-day cycles of treatment will be evaluated&#xD;
      for entry into an extended Continuation Phase of the study. Subjects will be eligible for&#xD;
      continuation if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They demonstrate no evidence of disease progression;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the opinion of the Investigator they are deemed reasonably likely to continue to&#xD;
           benefit from treatment; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They have not experienced any toxicity requiring discontinuation. During the&#xD;
           Continuation Phase, subjects will continue to receive FS102 at the same dose they were&#xD;
           originally assigned, unless modified downward for earlier toxicity. No dose escalation&#xD;
           within subjects will be permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment may continue until one of the following criteria applies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease progression;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervening illness that prevents further administration of treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unacceptable adverse events;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Significant subject non-compliance with protocol;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject decides to withdraw from study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General or specific changes in the subject's condition that render the subject&#xD;
           unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the Investigator; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sponsor decides to end the study.&#xD;

                  range, the Investigator may initiate appropriate measures to correct. However&#xD;
                  administration of FS102 may not proceed until the specified electrolytes have&#xD;
