  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to assess the feasibility and biologic activity of a&#xD;
      modified Atkins-based diet combined with short-term intermittent fasting, a GLioma&#xD;
      Atkins-based Diet (GLAD), in patients with central nervous system GBM.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malignant gliomas have a high glycolytic rate and are dependent on glucose for energy&#xD;
      metabolism. This so called &quot;Warburg effect&quot; or the reliance of central nervous system (CNS)&#xD;
      tumor cells on glucose utilization through glycolysis has been identified as a potential&#xD;
      therapeutic target in cancer metabolism. Preclinically, reduced cerebral glucose via calorie&#xD;
      restriction has been repeatedly associated with tumor reduction and improved survival in&#xD;
      glioma animal models. Such work has led to several early clinical studies evaluating the&#xD;
      ketogenic diet (KD) in patients with recurrent GBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The modified Atkins diet (MAD) is designed to provide a more palatable, less restrictive but&#xD;
      effective alternative to the strict KD, particularly for adults. The MAD does not require&#xD;
      inpatient admission for initial fast, weight of foods, or severe dietary restrictions and is&#xD;
      generally well tolerated, easier to administer, and more practical for adults. The MAD lacks&#xD;
      calorie restriction, an important component to dietary therapies in preclinical&#xD;
      investigations. Emerging evidence also suggests that short term fasting may provide superior&#xD;
      anti-cancer activity to long term calorie restriction and that these benefits have been&#xD;
      observed without substantial weight loss that can be observed with longer term calorie&#xD;
      restriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In glioma patients, a diet therapy that combines the broad clinical application of the MAD&#xD;
      with the caloric impact of short-term intermittent fasting is therefore optimal. Moreover,&#xD;
      initiation of this diet when the cancer has already undergone induction therapy and is&#xD;
      clinically and radiographically stable, may provide the optimal time for metabolic&#xD;
      intervention to prevent recurrence or progression.&#xD;
