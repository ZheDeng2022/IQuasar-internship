    <textblock>
      The hypofractionated external radiation (EBRT) is a technique that radiation dose delivery&#xD;
      using higher daily fractions than those used routinely. In this way can cause more damage&#xD;
      tumor, especially in tissues that have a slower proliferation rate, as in the case of&#xD;
      prostate cancer. Furthermore, achieves a reduction in total treatment time and probably a&#xD;
      lesser chance of development of collateral in tissues of high multiplication rate as the&#xD;
      lining of the rectum and bladder effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With brachytherapy boost for high dose rate is achieved by administering a more intense dose&#xD;
      on the tumor and lower the sound around the region to be treated tissues, improving the&#xD;
      therapeutic window.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with retracted and fully ambulatory time, has potential benefit as early patient&#xD;
      return to usual activities and optimizing the flow of patients who require treatment with&#xD;
      radiotherapy. This prospective study aims to assess the results and the toxicity profile of&#xD;
      this treatment regimen retracted.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE The primary objective is to analyze the toxicity profile, via a phase II study of&#xD;
      treatment of patients with low risk prostate cancer with the association of hypo fractionated&#xD;
      EBRT and HDR brachytherapy boost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will also analyze the biochemical control and expense to the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN Prospective phase II study and not randomized. Patients with localized low-risk&#xD;
      prostate cancer will be recruited to participate in protocol hypofractionated external beam&#xD;
      radiotherapy followed by brachytherapy high dose rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biopsy confirming adenocarcinoma of the prostate;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Low risk prostate cancer: less than or equal T2a, and less than or equal to 10 ng PSA /&#xD;
           ml stage and Gleason score less than or equal to 6&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prostate volume less than or equal to 60cc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients under 18 or over 90 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adjuvant Hormone (any duration);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior pelvic radiotherapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adjuvant Chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOMES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduction of rectal acute morbidity (within three months of treatment) and late (after three&#xD;
      months to twelve months from the last treatment recruited patient).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduction of acute urinary morbidity (within three months of treatment) and late (after three&#xD;
      months to twelve months from the last treatment recruited patient).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes (toxicity) will be evaluated in patients who receive more than 90% of&#xD;
      the intended dose protocol with crte and HDR brachytherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Scale used: CTCAE v4.03, Published online: May 28,2009 by the United States Department of&#xD;
      Health and Human Services - NIH - attached).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical control (serial PSA measurements at intervals of three months in the first year,&#xD;
      four months in the second year, six months of the third year onwards).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost-analysis procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAGING&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performing the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Physical examination - rectal (TR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. transrectal US (TRUS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. pelvic CT&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. serum prostatic specific antigen (PSA) dosage&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Bone Scan&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL ASPECTS The treatment regimen will be monitored for the possible emergence of&#xD;
      excessive toxicity, considering that the same appearance in more than 25% of cases will be&#xD;
      cause for termination of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will begin after approval by the Research Ethics Committee (CEP) of the AC Camargo&#xD;
      Cancer Center. Each patient will sign a term of informed consent (IC) prior to study entry.&#xD;
      The term was written in accessible layman's language the patient, following the ethical&#xD;
      recommendations. Patients may withdraw from the study at any time, without prejudice to the&#xD;
      proposed treatment. We declare the confidentiality of personally identifiable patient, it is&#xD;
      not possible to identify it during analysis and publication of data.&#xD;
