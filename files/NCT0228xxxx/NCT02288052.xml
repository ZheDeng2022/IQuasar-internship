  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The basal ganglia play an important role in motor learning, especially during the&#xD;
      consolidation phase of motor learning. This raises the question whether it is possible to&#xD;
      sustain learning increments in a neurodegenerative condition such as Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      (PD). The aim of this study is to gain knowledge on whether it is possible to relearn skills&#xD;
      which are actually affected by PD, such as writing, and determine whether neuroplasticity is&#xD;
      possible. In this randomized controlled study, PD patients will either follow intensive&#xD;
      writing training or a placebo treatment (stretch and relaxation training) during 6 weeks. The&#xD;
      writing training will focus on automatization (withstanding dual task interference), transfer&#xD;
      to an untrained task and retention. The placebo program is aimed to reduce stiffness in the&#xD;
      upper limbs and has been shown to be ineffective in PD. To date, it is unknown how neural&#xD;
      networks change as a result of consolidation after a prolonged period of motor learning in&#xD;
      PD. Therefore the second arm of this study will investigate, for the first time, changes in&#xD;
      neural connectivity using brain imaging data to elucidate which neuroanatomical regions are&#xD;
      involved in consolidation of learning in PD. Finally, DTI and resting state fMRI-analysis&#xD;
      will complement insights into the neural changes as a result of learning.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This translational study is a monocentric Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). The&#xD;
      investigators will recruit 40 PD patients from the early Hoehn &amp; Yahr stages. Patients will&#xD;
      be randomly allocated to an experimental group (writing training) and a control group&#xD;
      (stretch- and relaxation training). All patients will receive the same frequency and duration&#xD;
      of intervention. After the training period, patients will be followed up for another 6 weeks.&#xD;
      Patients will be tested in the ON-phase of the medication cycle at 3 occasions: before (T1)&#xD;
      and after training (T2) and after a 6-week retention period (T3). At T1 &amp; T2 participants&#xD;
      will be tested at the behavioral &amp; neural level. At T3 participants will only be tested at&#xD;
      the behavioral level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor performance will be measured using MRI-compatible touch sensitive tablets and pencils.&#xD;
      This system allows registration and translation of writing movements into online-cursor&#xD;
      movements on screen in and outside a scanner environment. Both patient groups will be&#xD;
      compared during a behavioral test battery consisting of (i) a trained sequence with and&#xD;
      without visual cues; (ii) an untrained sequence with and without visual cues to test&#xD;
      transfer; and (iii) a trained dual task to test automatization. Visual cues will consist of&#xD;
      differently colored target zones of different band widths, indicating the scale and accuracy&#xD;
      of writing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional MRI measurements will take place in a 3T MR Philips Intera scanner. Before&#xD;
      scanning, subjects will undergo a training session in a dummy scanner to familiarize them&#xD;
      with the scanner environment and task instructions. During the fMRI sessions, participants&#xD;
      will perform a trained and untrained sequence, both with and without visual cues. To control&#xD;
      for differences in movement speed, all participants will perform the tasks at the same&#xD;
      frequency, defined by an auditory pace. In addition to the fMRI measurements, resting state&#xD;
      fMRI and DTI will also be performed to reveal alterations of the structural and functional&#xD;
      connectivity between critical regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioral data will be recorded as xy-coordinates and pressure values at a sampling rate of&#xD;
      200Hz and with a spatial resolution of 32.5µm. Statistical analysis of the behavioral data&#xD;
      will have a between-subject factor of group (experimental and placebo group) and a&#xD;
      within-subject factor of time (before training, after training and after the retention&#xD;
      period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Image analysis will be performed with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) software. The&#xD;
      investigators will contrast for either decreased or increased activation, as different&#xD;
      regions may show divergent changes related to learning and transfer, with group as a&#xD;
      between-subject factor and time (before and after training) and task condition (trained with&#xD;
      cues, trained without cues, untrained with cues and untrained without cues) as within-subject&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
