      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of&#xD;
      CBP-307 following oral single and multiple escalating dose administration in healthy&#xD;
      subjects. The study will have two parts: Part 1 will assess 5 dose levels of the drug in&#xD;
      single dosing; and Part 2 will evaluate 3 dose levels in 28-day repeat dosing. The effect of&#xD;
      food will also be evaluated in a single dosing study.&#xD;
