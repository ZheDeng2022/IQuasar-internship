      The goal of the clinical investigation is to reduce phantom limb pain (PLP), a painful&#xD;
      condition affecting 70% of amputees, so as to improve these patients' quality of life.&#xD;
      Traditionally, mirror box therapy and other tools based on the same concept, have been used&#xD;
      to alleviate pain, but their efficacy varies greatly. This project targets amputees for whom&#xD;
      other PLP treatments have failed. Various virtual environments, including virtual/augmented&#xD;
      reality, are controlled by the patient's phantom limb using muscle (myoelectric) signals from&#xD;
      the stump. The patient learns to reactivates areas in the brain related to motor control of&#xD;
      the missing limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medical device is non-invasive and based on surface electromyography, a standard and&#xD;
      widely used clinical and research tool. The surface electrodes are a standard disposable&#xD;
      electrodes widely used in clinics and hospitals for EMG and/or ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Myoelectric amplifiers (battery operated and isolated from the power grid)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data acquisition electronics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Personal computer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard webcam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Myoelectric pattern recognition (MPR) software&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Virtual Reality (VR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Augmented Reality (AR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Computer game&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical investigation period consists of 12 sessions per patient including 3 short&#xD;
      follow-up assessments. Length of the session: 1.5 hours (the first sessions can take longer&#xD;
      time due to learning/familiarization). The centers participating in this study can choose&#xD;
      between the following treatment administrations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 times per week (advised)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 time per week&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily (5 times per week)&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Measuring the portion of patients that had a reduction of PLP according to the calculated weighted pain distribution (WPD)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 treatment sessions (up to 12 weeks) + follow up (6months). Time frame will be total of 9 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Each patient is asked to estimate the time spent in a given level of pain (as by VAS). The WPD is the sum of the portion of time multiplied with the pain level (0 to 5). This can also be explained as weighted mean calculation. The time with a given level of pain can be estimated in minutes/hours and extrapolated to its corresponding portion from the total time. Phantom Limb pain, which is a chronic pain, is difficult to describe can not be assesst in a single point in time. That is why patients are asked to fill in the amount of time they spend in each level of pain.</description>

    <measure>Descriptive analysis on the effect of the proposed treatment on quality of life, disability at the activity and participation levels.(DASH/COPM/EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 treatment sessions (up to 12 weeks) + follow up (6months). Time frame will be total of 9 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaires are answered before the first treatment and after the last treatment. Patients will also answer the questionnaires for a follow-up.</description>

    <measure>Measure the portion of patients that had a reduction of PLP with the use of visual analog scale and reduction on the &quot;pain rating index&quot;.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 treatment sessions (up to 12 weeks) + follow up (6months). Time frame will be total of 9 months.</time_frame>
    <description>For the Pain Rating Index (PRI), each selected word is scored from 0 (none) to 5 (Excruciating pain). The total Pain Rating Index score is obtained by summing the item scores and higher score indicates worse pain.</description>
