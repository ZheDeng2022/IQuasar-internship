      The purpose of the study is to establish wether a contrast medium applied to the middle ear&#xD;
      can be used to diagnose pathology in the auditory tube. We will examine patients with and&#xD;
      without middle ear disease with CT after the application of an iodine based contrast medium.&#xD;

      Introduction Dysfunction in the auditory tube / Eustachian tube (ET) is a frequent problem&#xD;
      that may cause a series of middle ear conditions. Middle ear atelectasis, retraction of the&#xD;
      tympanic membrane, in some cases &quot;retraction pocket type-cholesteatoma&quot; (5), chronic otitis,&#xD;
      perforation of the tympanic membrane and conductive hearing loss due to poor middle ear&#xD;
      ventilation are all associated with ET-dysfunction. The ET consists of two parts, the mobile&#xD;
      cartilaginous part medially, and the fixated bony part laterally. The bony part is demarcated&#xD;
      by thin bony walls and situated in the close proximity of vulnerable anatomical structures,&#xD;
      while the cartilaginous part is supported by parapharyngeal soft tissue. Recent years, a new&#xD;
      treatment procedure of ET balloon dilation has emerged. Restoration of ET function has&#xD;
      offered a new approach for this large group of patients with great reduction of symptoms and&#xD;
      secondary middle ear disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only the cartilaginous part of the ET is accessible for treatment procedures. We also know&#xD;
      that 20% of the patients dilated do not respond to dilation, and relapse of middle ear&#xD;
      disease occurs (2). At present, no diagnostic procedure can distinguish between later&#xD;
      responders and non-responders to dilation. Therefore, level diagnostics of obstruction and&#xD;
      possibly identification of other discriminating parameters are important. Computer tomography&#xD;
      (CT) is considered necessary before any type of tube intervention, mainly to exclude&#xD;
      obstruction in the bony part of the tube or identification of any other pathoanatomical&#xD;
      condition to contraindicate balloon dilatation. Visualisation of obstructions in the&#xD;
      cartilaginous part is not possible with today's methods. Nor does the method provide any&#xD;
      information on tube function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a need for better diagnostic imaging of the ET. In this project we plan to develop a&#xD;
      method for contrast medium application to the ET via the middle ear followed by CT imaging.&#xD;
      The purpose is to tell whether the ET is open or on which level it is obstructed. So far some&#xD;
      publications have showed that contrast media can pass through the ET (6,7,8), but no&#xD;
      systematic trials have been published, clarifying the potential of the method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have recently conducted studies on temporal bone specimens from human cadavers and on 8&#xD;
      living rabbits. Results from these studies are not yet published, but our hypotheses are&#xD;
      supported that the method for ET visualisation is feasible, safe, and that contrast media&#xD;
      passes unhindered through a normal ET after application in the middle ear (6,7,8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence the next step of the trial is to explore whether the method provides new information in&#xD;
      human subjects with and without tube dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses Contrast medium applied in the middle ear passes through the ET and is visualised&#xD;
      in the epipharynx in the following CT examination of the temporal bone in individuals with&#xD;
      healthy middle ears and ET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contrast media applied in the middle ear does not pass through the entire ET and is not&#xD;
      visualised in the epipharynx in the following CT examination of the temporal bone in&#xD;
      individuals in the patient group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible to identify a highest level of obstruction after contrast media application in&#xD;
      the middle ear based on visual identification of the lowest visible level of contrast medium&#xD;
      in the ET in the following CT examination of the temporal bone in the patient group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level of obstruction of the ET predicts outcome of ET balloon dilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material One fifth of chronic patients with otitis media with effusion (OME) have no&#xD;
      beneficial effect of balloon dilation (2). We hypothesize that contrast media will not pass&#xD;
      through the bony part of the ET in a majority of these patients, while it does in a majority&#xD;
      of the patients experiencing successful relief of disease after balloon dilation. Variation&#xD;
      is not known, but is presumed not to exceed 20%. Sample size calculation is not&#xD;
      straight-forward in this case, handling dichotomous variables. Power calculation indicates a&#xD;
      needed number of 80 individuals in the patient group to have a power of at least 80% for the&#xD;
      detection of difference between these 2 groups with an alpha level of 5% with two-sided&#xD;
      tests. Additionally, we include 15 controls with presumed healthy middle ears and ET to&#xD;
      verify significantly better contrast media passage to epipharynx in these individuals than in&#xD;
      the group of patients with chronic OME, based on similar power calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of this number to undergo a CT examination with contrast carefully administered&#xD;
      through the tympanostomy tube will be done during a clinically indicated and planned CT to&#xD;
      avoid excess radiation dose and additional visits to the hospital for the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mb Meniere patients are occasionally treated with tympanostomy tubes, although they do not&#xD;
      have middle ear pathology. This patient group also routinely undergoes CT-examination of the&#xD;
      temporal bone. Hence we plan to include 10 patients with mb Meniere and tympanostomy tubes to&#xD;
      be examined with a similar contrast medium CT protocol as described above as a healthy&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method Out patients referred to the Ear, nose and throat (ENT)-clinic for OME will be offered&#xD;
      to be part of the study, given that they qualify according to the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. All patients will be given written information and a consensus form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At their first visit, the ENT- surgeon will control the status of the eardrum and middle ear&#xD;
      by otomicroscopy. The extent of pneumatisation / atelectasis and fluid in the middle ear will&#xD;
      be evaluated in addition to the state and position of the tympanic membrane. With a nasal&#xD;
      endoscope the condition of Rosenmullers fossa and the function of torus tubarius will be&#xD;
      examined. The latter is controlled by asking the patient to equalize pressure while the scope&#xD;
      is in the nasopharynx, and the opening of the torus can be seen. The patients and controls&#xD;
      are interviewed structurally for symptoms related to middle ear and temporal bone disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included patients without a tympanostomy tube will be given one the same day as the clinical&#xD;
      examination. The patients who are not treated with nasal corticosteroids will be prescribed&#xD;
      them for use up until the first control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT will be performed after 3-4 weeks. At the CT-lab an ENT-surgeon will drip 2 ml iodixanol&#xD;
      contrast medium diluted with saline (NaCl) to 20% into the tympanostomy tube while the&#xD;
      patient lies on his / her back with the head slightly turned to the opposite side. After&#xD;
      turning the head to a neutral position and a delay of 10 minutes the CT examination will be&#xD;
      conducted using 200 milliampere (mA) and 120 kilo volt (kV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reconstructions will be made from the raw material. In addition to axial and coronal&#xD;
      reconstructions, images series will be reconstructed in an oblique coronal image plane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physicist will contribute to achieve the best possible protocol. As an example it is&#xD;
      possible to use different kV values while keeping the dose parameters (CTDIw) on the same&#xD;
      level as for the existing temporal bone protocol. By allowing the mAs value to change, we&#xD;
      will be able to decide on the optimal kV level for this study, without exposing some of the&#xD;
      patients to higher radiation dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physicist will also be involved in the optimisation of the reconstruction of the images&#xD;
      of ET. The images will be reconstructed with different filters and degrees of iterative&#xD;
      reconstruction. Using radiologists as observers, the optimal reconstruction settings for the&#xD;
      Eustachian tube will be selected. The physicist will also calculate organ doses and effective&#xD;
      dose for the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients included in the study will be treated with balloon dilation in general&#xD;
      anaesthesia, 3 - 4 weeks after the CT procedure. The ENT surgeon will be blinded to the&#xD;
      result from the contrast media part of the CT examination. In relation to the hospital stay&#xD;
      for balloon dilation patients will be repeatedly examined and interviewed similarly to the&#xD;
      examination at inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up is conducted 3 months and 6 months after balloon dilatation with renewed clinical&#xD;
      examination and interview, according to the presently established routine follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parameters to be noted from the different time points are CT findings including contrast&#xD;
      media passage, clinical and biochemical signs on inflammation and/or infection, symptoms&#xD;
      related to middle ear or temporal bone disease and/or general infection, and clinical result&#xD;
      from ET balloon dilation finally dividing the patient group into responders or non-responders&#xD;
      from dilation.&#xD;
