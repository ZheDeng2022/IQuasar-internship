      Part A: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple ascending doses of GWP42003-P&#xD;
      compared with placebo with respect to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence, type and severity of adverse events (AEs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Effect on vital signs, including weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Effect on 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) findings&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Effect on laboratory parameters Part B: To make an assessment of the anti-epileptic&#xD;
           efficacy of GWP42003-P compared with placebo with respect to the incidence in convulsive&#xD;
           seizures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the plasma concentration time curves for GWP42003-P and its major human&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center study will consist of two parts: Part A and Part B. Part A will investigate&#xD;
      the dose-ranging pharmacokinetics and tolerability of GWP42003-P.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B is a 1:1 randomized, placebo-controlled 60 day comparison of GWP42003-P against&#xD;
      placebo, at the dose which has been identified by Part A as the maximum tolerated dose. Part&#xD;
      B will investigate the efficacy and safety of GWP42003-P.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following completion of Part B, all patients will be invited to continue to receive&#xD;
      GWP42003-P in an open label extension study (which is separate to this protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A Following establishment of initial eligibility and baseline measurements, patients&#xD;
      will enter Part A at Visit 1 and will begin the two month baseline observation period.&#xD;
      Patients will record their number of convulsive seizures, and of other seizures, using an&#xD;
      IVRS telephone diary system (recorded twice each day). Each call will take approximately five&#xD;
      minutes to complete. Patients will return to the clinic at Visit 2 and the investigator will&#xD;
      assess the patient's daily number of convulsive seizures from the patient's IVRS data.&#xD;
      Patients who have experienced at least four convulsive seizures (tonic-clonic seizures and/or&#xD;
      drop attacks) per month for each of the previous two months) and who meet all of the other&#xD;
      inclusion/ exclusion criteria will be eligible to continue in the study. Patients will be&#xD;
      asked for information regarding AEs, concomitant medications and/or changes to their&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will enter into the pharmacokinetics part of the study at Visit 2 where&#xD;
      blood samples will be taken using a sparse sampling strategy to minimize the blood volumes&#xD;
      required for analysis of the plasma concentration/time curve for concomitant AEDs and routine&#xD;
      safety bloods. This is conducted prior to the administration of Study medication at Dose&#xD;
      Level 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each dose level, patients will be randomly assigned so that eight patients receive&#xD;
      GWP42003-P and two patients receive placebo in each group. Patients will receive their study&#xD;
      medication each day for the seven day exposure period. During this part of the study,&#xD;
      patients will continue to record their daily number of convulsive seizures and of other&#xD;
      seizures, using an IVRS telephone diary system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Day 7 (Visit 3), blood will be taken for analysis of both the plasma concentration/time&#xD;
      curve of GWP42003-P and its major metabolite, concomitant anti-epileptic medications and for&#xD;
      routine safety purposes. At the end of the dosing period in Part A of the study patients will&#xD;
      continue on placebo until they are ready to enter Part B of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Level 2 will follow the same set of procedures as Dose Level 1, but dosing will not&#xD;
      start until an evaluation of the clinical and pharmacokinetic results from Dose Group 1 has&#xD;
      been completed. Subsequently Dose Groups 3 and 4 will be subject to the same procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When Dose Group 4 has completed the seven day Dosing Period, and subject to assessment of&#xD;
      clinical safety and pharmacokinetics, patients will then be invited to continue into Part B,&#xD;
      which is the double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase to investigate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of GWP42003-P. There will be a washout period of at least two weeks between the&#xD;
      last dosing day in Part A and randomization in Part B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B Patients, from any of the dosing groups, who have completed will be invited to&#xD;
      participate into Part B which is a 1:1 randomized, placebo-controlled 60 day comparison of&#xD;
      GWP42003-P against placebo. They will receive the dose which was identified by Part A as the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose. Part B will investigate the efficacy and safety of GWP42003-P.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Part B, patients will continue to record their number of convulsive seizures and other&#xD;
      seizures, using an IVRS telephone diary system (recorded twice each day). Assessments will&#xD;
      also be made of cognitive function, nocturnal sleep quality and daytime sleepiness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: Eligible patients who have not previously participated in Part A, and who wish to&#xD;
      participate in Part B will begin the two month baseline observation period to establish a&#xD;
      baseline. Patients will follow the same procedures as outlined in Visit 1 (of Part A).&#xD;
      Patients will record their number of convulsive seizures (and of other seizures), using an&#xD;
      IVRS telephone diary system (recorded twice each day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: The primary endpoint is the safety and tolerability profile of single and multiple&#xD;
      ascending doses of GWP42003-P compared with placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The variables for analysis will be the difference in incidence, type and severity of AEs,&#xD;
      vital signs, ECG, laboratory, and physical examination parameters of GWP42003-P compared with&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: The primary endpoint is the number of patients experiencing at least a 50% reduction&#xD;
      in the number of convulsive seizures (from baseline) on active treatment compared with&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: Pharmacokinetic:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. GWP42003-P: The plasma concentration/time curve will be described following multiple&#xD;
           doses of GWP42003-P, with the aim being to define&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cmax&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  tmax&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  AUC0-∞, AUC0-t&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  t½ The analytes for the pharmacokinetic analysis will be CBD and its major human&#xD;
                metabolite 7-OH-CBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Concomitant AEDs: The plasma concentration/time curve for concomitant AEDs will be&#xD;
           described pre-treatment, and then after seven days of treatment with GWP42003-P, using a&#xD;
           sparse sampling strategy. As far as possible, the plasma concentration/time relationship&#xD;
           pre-treatment will be compared with the results following treatment with GWP42003-P.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: Efficacy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Number and type of non-convulsive seizures&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cognitive function&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sleep quality&#xD;
