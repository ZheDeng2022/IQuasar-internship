  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is recognized that inflammation can be modulated by cholinergic stimulation and that&#xD;
      galantamine, an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase enzyme with central nervous system action,&#xD;
      has showed an anti-inflammatory effect, reducing body weight, abdominal fat and improvement&#xD;
      in tissue insulin resistance in animal models. Galantamine is a safe drug that is used to&#xD;
      treat alzheimer disease.Galantamine treatments of patients with the metabolic syndrome may&#xD;
      represent a significant advance in management of this disease. This study aims to investigate&#xD;
      the effects of galantamine on inflammatory markers, as well as on abdominal visceral and&#xD;
      epicardial fat and oxidative stress in patients with metabolic syndrome. This is a pioneering&#xD;
      study that will include expert support. The enrolling of subjects will have continuous&#xD;
      monitoring throughout the period of treatment. The study is a double blind randomized&#xD;
      prospective study with 60 patients with metabolic syndrome, to be randomized at ratio of 1: 1&#xD;
      placebo and galantamine. The dose of galanthamine is the standard clinically approved (8 and&#xD;
      16 mg). The tracking method include metabolic analysis, inflammatory and oxidative stress&#xD;
      markers, hemodynamic evaluation with hear rate variability (sympatho vagal modulation)&#xD;
      before, during and after treatment. Computerized tomography assessment of visceral abdominal&#xD;
      and epicardial fat before and after treatment will be performed.&#xD;

      Population: patients with metabolic syndrome; Intervention: Galantamine; Comparation:&#xD;
      Placebo; Outcomes (primary): proinflammatory cytokines levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with criteria of Metabolic Syndrome (with the 2005 revised NCEP ATP III criteria)&#xD;
      will be randomized to 2 groups: use of galantamina (30 patients) or placebo (30 patients) in&#xD;
      the following sequency:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I) 4 weeks of treatment with 8 mg of galantamine or placedo (oral ingestion capsules);&#xD;
&#xD;
      II) 8 weeks of treatment with 16 mg of galantamine or placebo (oral ingestion capsules).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive a diary to record any symptoms that may present and will be&#xD;
      instructed to bring it at each study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before randomization all participants will go through the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical and neurological evaluation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sample analysis of cytokines, oxidative stress and biochemical parameters;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multidetector computed tomographic (MDCT) scan of abdomen (visceral - abdominal and&#xD;
           epicardial fat) and thorax (calcium score);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood pressure recording for hemodynamic evaluation and assessment of heart rate&#xD;
           variability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24h ambulatory blood pressure measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
      These procedures will be repeated at the end of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized controlled trial study. Blinding status: Patients, investigators, and&#xD;
      outcome assessors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants were outpatients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The invitation to participate in the study and all the details of the protocol will be&#xD;
      explained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the patients have the criteria for inclusion, they receive the cards with capsules&#xD;
      containing placebo or galantamine according to continuous numerical order provided by the&#xD;
      pharmacy that prepared and randomized such substances (numbered containers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug and placebo will be manipulated and encapsulated in identical packaging at the Central&#xD;
      Pharmacy of School of Medicine, University of São Paulo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use simple randomisation using a randomisation table created by computer software -&#xD;
      graphpad Software- quickcalcs.&#xD;
