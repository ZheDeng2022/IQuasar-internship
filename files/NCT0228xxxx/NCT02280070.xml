      1. Patient registration procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      If it is confirmed that the subject meets the inclusion criteria and correspondent none of&#xD;
      the exclusion criteria, the subject is registered by using CReS Kyushu&#xD;
      registration/allocation system (CK-RAS). The registration with CK-RAS is available for 24hr&#xD;
      (URL: https://reg.cres-kyushu.or.jp/qmin/login/) and needs for individual ID and password.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Quality management&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
           A central monitoring or in-site monitoring are carried out based on the data from case&#xD;
           report form (CRF) collecting at data coordinating center. In principle, an on-site&#xD;
           monitoring is not carried out, but it may be carried out when the on-site monitoring is&#xD;
           determined to need by Kyushu Study group of Clinical Cancer (KSCC) steering committee&#xD;
           from the results of the central monitoring so on.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data Monitoring Committee&#xD;
&#xD;
           A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) has been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Data entry&#xD;
&#xD;
           All data will be entered by the double entry method. Referential data rules, valid&#xD;
           values, range checks, and consistency checks against data already stored in the database&#xD;
           will be supported. Checks will be applied at the time of data entry into a specific&#xD;
           field. Additional errors will be detected by programs designed to detect missing data or&#xD;
           specific errors in the data. The investigator who receives the inquiry will respond by&#xD;
           checking the original forms for inconsistency, checking other sources to determine the&#xD;
           correction, modifying the original paper form entering a response to the query.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Regular monitoring report&#xD;
&#xD;
           A regular monitoring report generated by data coordinating center is submitted to KSCC&#xD;
           Steering Committee, principal investigator, the DMC etc and it is reviewed according to&#xD;
           &quot;KSCC regulation on the monitoring&quot;. The information on the status of site EC approval&#xD;
           and the achievement of enrollment: number of enrollment- total/per periodical, total/per&#xD;
           site, is reported monthly using e-mail.&#xD;

                     case determined as ineligible/number of eligible case/the case determined as&#xD;
                     non-treatment/total number of treatment case&#xD;
&#xD;
                  5. Review of a target population for analysis: the number of cases targeted for&#xD;
                     efficacy analysis/safety analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
                  6. Patient background&#xD;
&#xD;
                  7. Treatment time-course: summary of on-treatment and discontinuation/summary of&#xD;
                     reason for discontinuation/list of reason for discontinuation&#xD;
&#xD;
                  8. Protocol violation/deviation&#xD;
&#xD;
                  9. Safety evaluation: serious adverse reaction, event/the case which was notified&#xD;
                     to the study group among the adverse reactions, events with an ordinary&#xD;
                     report/general adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
                 10. Others&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Audit&#xD;
&#xD;
      A site audit is carried out by the audit members of KSCC Coordinating Center, data&#xD;
      coordinating center, medical staff of other site under the approval of the site director&#xD;
      according to &quot;KSCC regulation for site audit&quot;. The results of the audit are reported to the&#xD;
      site director, KSCC Steering Committee, principal investigator etc. (if required, to DMC).&#xD;
