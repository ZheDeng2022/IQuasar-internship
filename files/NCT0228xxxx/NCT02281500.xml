    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy, and&#xD;
      safety of human plasma-derived fibrinogen concentrate FIB Grifols after a single-dose 70&#xD;
      milligrams/kilogram (mg/kg) body weight administration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a phase I-II, multi-center, prospective, open-label, single-arm, clinical trial&#xD;
      to evaluate Pharmacokinetic (PK), efficacy, and safety of human plasma-derived fibrinogen&#xD;
      concentrate (FIB Grifols) in adult and pediatric participants with congenital&#xD;
      afibrinogenemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 10 adult participants (≥18 years) with congenital afibrinogenemia will be&#xD;
      administered a single dose of FIB Grifols at 70 mg/kg body weight and will be followed for&#xD;
      PK, efficacy, and safety assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the safety of fibrinogen concentrate FIB Grifols is assessed in at least 10 adult&#xD;
      participants and no safety issues are raised by the sponsor, the study will start to enroll&#xD;
      approximately 10 pediatric subjects (&lt;18 years) who will be dosed with study drug and&#xD;
      followed for PK, efficacy, and safety assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All enrolled participants (both adult and pediatric) will have documented congenital&#xD;
      fibrinogen deficiency manifested as afibrinogenemia but will not have received any&#xD;
      fibrinogen-containing product therapy within the preceding 21 days before the infusion of&#xD;
      study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants (both adult and pediatrics) will be infused with the investigational product&#xD;
      at 70 mg/kg body weight. PK parameters that will be calculated from plasma fibrinogen levels&#xD;
      measured at different time points include: incremental in vivo recovery [IVR], area under the&#xD;
      curve (AUC) calculated as AUC from zero to 14 days (AUC^0-14days) and AUC from zero to&#xD;
      infinity (AUC^0-∞), maximum plasma concentration (C^max), time to the observed maximum plasma&#xD;
      concentration (t^max), half-life (t^1/2), mean residence time (MRT), volume of distribution&#xD;
      (Vd), and clearance (Cl).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemostatic efficacy of the investigational product will be assessed by means of rotational&#xD;
      thromboelastometry (ROTEM) measure of maximum clot firmness (MCF) at baseline and 1 hour&#xD;
      post-infusion. Other thromboelastographic measures as well as standard coagulation tests will&#xD;
      be also determined pre- and post-infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical safety, viral safety, and immunogenicity will be assessed in this clinical trial.&#xD;
      Safety variables include adverse events (AEs), vital signs, physical assessments, laboratory&#xD;
      tests, viral markers, and antibodies against human fibrinogen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A monitoring plan will be implemented by the sponsor to carefully monitor and evaluate&#xD;
      allergic/hypersensitivity reactions and thrombotic events during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stopping criteria have been established for immunogenic and thrombogenic events. If a single&#xD;
      case of any these events is reported after a participants has been dosed with study drug, any&#xD;
      further enrollment and dosing of participants in the study will be suspended until the event&#xD;
      can be adequately assessed by the sponsor. The enrollment and dosing will only resume if the&#xD;
      sponsor deems it is safe to do so.&#xD;

        <title>AUC From Time Zero to Infinite Time (AUC0-infinity) of FIB Grifols Determined by Clauss Method, Dose Normalized to 70 mg/kg and Corrected for Baseline Concentration</title>
        <description>AUC0-infinity was calculated as AUC0-t + Ct/Kel, where (AUC0-t) was the area under the concentration versus (vs) time curve from time 0 to the time of last quantifiable concentration (Ct), and Kel was the apparent terminal first-order elimination rate constant, determined by linear regression analysis of the natural log-linear segment of the plasma concentration-time curve, expressed in time^-1 units (1/h). Plasma fibrinogen activity was determined by the Clauss method in the central laboratory of the study. PK parameters adjusted for baseline fibrinogen level calculated by deducting the pre-infusion fibrinogen concentration from the post-infusion concentrations before the calculation.</description>

          <description>Clearance of a drug was a measure of the rate at which a drug was metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. PK parameters adjusted for baseline fibrinogen level calculated by deducting the pre-infusion fibrinogen concentration from the post-infusion concentrations before the calculation.</description>
