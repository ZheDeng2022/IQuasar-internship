  <brief_summary>

      This is a pilot prospective single blind controlled trial comparing magnetically steerable&#xD;
      gastric capsule endoscopy to conventional oesophagogastroduodenoscopy in diagnosing upper&#xD;
      gastrointestinal pathology in patients with recurrent/refractory iron-deficient anaemia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastroscopy (OGD) is a useful test for investigating a variety of suspected upper GI&#xD;
      disorders. But it is uncomfortable for patients and incurs the risk of intubation and&#xD;
      sedation, plus a large proportion of procedures reveal insignificant or no pathology. Capsule&#xD;
      endoscopy (CE) is the investigation of choice for diseases of the small bowel. It is safe,&#xD;
      noninvasive and well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of CE is traditionally restricted to the small bowel, although newer capsules to&#xD;
      image the oesophagus and colon are currently in use. Previous capsules have failed to&#xD;
      adequately image the stomach due to its large volume and rugal folds. Recently a magnetic&#xD;
      capsule and handheld magnet has been developed (Microcam Navi, Intromedic Ltd, Seoul, Korea)&#xD;
      to enable an element of manoeuvrability of the capsule. This is unnecessary in the small&#xD;
      bowel where the capsule is propelled along its' tubular structure by peristalsis, but in the&#xD;
      capacious stomach this may allow the capsule to be steered to examine all areas of the&#xD;
      stomach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have already conducted two feasibility studies in porcine models with&#xD;
      promising results and a trial is currently underway using this equipment to steer the small&#xD;
      bowel capsule through the stomach into the duodenum. The next logical step is to compare this&#xD;
      technique to the conventional standard of upper GI investigationÍ¾ OGD. Patients with&#xD;
      recurrent or refractory iron deficiency anaemia require a combination of gastroscopy and&#xD;
      small bowel capsule endoscopy as part of their diagnostic investigations. The investigators&#xD;
      wish to undertake a pilot prospective single blind controlled trial comparing magnetically&#xD;
      steerable gastric capsule examination to conventional OGD in diagnosing upper&#xD;
      gastrointestinal pathology in patients with recurrent/refractory iron deficiency anaemia.&#xD;

    <description>Capsule endoscopy uses a swallowable pill camera which passes through the GI tract by the action of peristalsis. The procedure utilizes a battery powered wireless capsule to transmit images of the gastrointestinal tract as it passes through the small intestine. The images are later downloaded to a computer and reviewed by a trained physician. Magnetically steerable gastric capsule endoscopy uses a pill camera containing a small amount of magnetic material, that can be manoeuvred in the gut and intestine by the physician using a handheld magnet. This technique will be compared to conventional gastroscopy which uses a flexible endoscope. Both techniques will be used to diagnose upper gastrointestinal pathology in patients with recurrent/refractory iron deficient anemia.</description>
