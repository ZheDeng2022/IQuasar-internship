        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             for at least 12 continuous months)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In general good health as determined by medical history, physical examination, and&#xD;
             laboratory tests&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  LS spine BMD T-score between -1.0 and -2.4, inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least one analyzable BMD site at both the hip (left or right) and LS spine (at&#xD;
             least 3 measurable lumbar spine vertebrae, without fracture or sufficient degenerative&#xD;
             disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently receiving no medications for the treatment or prevention of osteoporosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Had been on continuous HRT for at least 1 year prior to enrollment. The HRT must have&#xD;
             ended within 18 months prior to the baseline visit, and the subject must have been off&#xD;
             HRT medication for at least 3 months at the time of baseline visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects rendered menopausal by surgical procedures between the ages of 55 and 65&#xD;
             years&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of cancer within 10 years prior to entry into the study, except for&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  A history of hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, osteomalacia, or other metabolic&#xD;
             bone disease within one year prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition or disease that may interfere with the evaluation of at least 3 lumbar&#xD;
             vertebrae (not necessarily contiguous), determined in a screening radiograph by a&#xD;
             radiologist at the central facility (e.g., confluent aortic calcifications, severe&#xD;
             osteoarthritis, spinal fusion, lumbar spine fractures)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of clinically significant organic or psychiatric disease on history or&#xD;
             physical examination, which in the opinion of the investigator would prevent the&#xD;
             patient from completing the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Markedly abnormal pretreatment laboratory finds that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, would prevent the patient from completing the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of using any of the following medications prior to starting study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any bisphosphonate therapy&#xD;

             within 1 year of study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine &gt;1.6 mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to sit or stand upright for 30 minutes after taking the morning dose of&#xD;
             risedronate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of deep vein thrombosis or other coagulation disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe hepatic insufficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of hypersensitivity to raloxifene, risedronate, or to drugs with similar&#xD;
             chemical structures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically relevant cardiovascular, hepatic, neurological, endocrine, or other major&#xD;
             systemic disease making implementation of the protocol or interpretation of the study&#xD;
             results difficult&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects found to have one or more vertebral fractures after completing thoracic and&#xD;

             years of baseline visit&#xD;
