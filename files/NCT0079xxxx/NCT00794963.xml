    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia patients treated with clozapine have a high prevalence of obesity-related&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome. The condition is often poorly treated and may lead to the emergence of&#xD;
      coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes. The study will investigate whether structured&#xD;
      treatment provided at the site of the outpatient psychiatric clinic of metabolic syndrome in&#xD;
      this population will decrease the severity of metabolic syndrome as compared with usual care&#xD;
      received by these patients in the community.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared with the general population, patients with schizophrenia have an increased risk of&#xD;
      death from atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD) that reflect coronary heart&#xD;
      disease, stroke and peripheral vascular disease (Newcomer, 2007). Among the factors&#xD;
      contributing to the increased prevalence of ASCVD in schizophrenia are a) unhealthy lifestyle&#xD;
      (cigarette smoking, lack of physical activity, increased consumption of calorie-dense foods&#xD;
      rich in saturated fats and carbohydrates), b) genetic vulnerability to glucose intolerance&#xD;
      and diabetes; c) metabolic side-effects of psychotropic drugs; and d) lack of access or&#xD;
      compliance with community-based medical care, particularly clozapine or olanzapine.&#xD;
      Biologically, the common pathway leading to increased risk of ASCVD in schizophrenia is the&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome, an entity defined as 3 or more of the following 5 characteristics:&#xD;
      abdominal obesity, increased blood pressure, increased fasting glucose, increased levels of&#xD;
      triglycerides and abnormally low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The&#xD;
      prevalence of metabolic syndrome in schizophrenia ranges form 29% to 63% and is significantly&#xD;
      greater than the frequency of 21% in the general population (Correll et al., 2006). As in the&#xD;
      general population, the metabolic syndrome of patients with schizophrenia is explained by&#xD;
      increased intraabdominal adiposity leading to insulin resistance and excess of circulating&#xD;
      free fatty acids which are converted into triglyceride-rich lipoproteins with atherogenic&#xD;
      potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of metabolic syndrome relies primarily on therapeutic lifestyle changes aiming&#xD;
      to reduce weight, decrease intake of saturated fats and carbohydrates with high glycemic&#xD;
      index, eliminate smoking, and increase physical activity. Drug therapy is required for the&#xD;
      patients who fail to respond to lifestyle changes and the American Heart Association (AHA)&#xD;
      has published detailed guidelines for the pharmacologic management of metabolic syndrome&#xD;
      (Grundy et al., 2005). These guidelines are based on research indicating substantial&#xD;
      improvement in the risk of ASCVD of patients with metabolic syndrome treated with metformin&#xD;
      and acarbose for impaired glucose tolerance; statins, fibrates and nicotinic acid for lipid&#xD;
      abnormalities; angiotensin receptor blockers for increased blood pressure; and sibutramine&#xD;
      and orlistat for weight management. Some of these interventions (e.g., metformin and&#xD;
      sibutramine for weight management) have been completed in research settings with small&#xD;
      samples of patients with schizophrenia (Henderson et al., 2005; Wu et al., 2008) and have&#xD;
      produced promising results. However, treatment trials using the comprehensive AHA guidelines&#xD;
      have not yet been conducted in schizophrenics with metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current Standard of Care at Zucker Hillside Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Aftercare Clinic at Zucker Hillside Hospital has the oldest Clozapine Clinic in the U.S.&#xD;
      Opened in 1987, the Clozapine Clinic has a current enrollment of 230 adult patients.&#xD;
      According to hospital policy, all Clozapine Clinic patients must have an annual physical&#xD;
      evaluation and laboratory tests for the detection of obesity, dyslipidemia, glucose&#xD;
      intolerance, hypertension and metabolic syndrome. The mandatory physical examinations are&#xD;
      performed by each patient's outside physician or by the Clinic's Nurse Practitioners.&#xD;
      Laboratory testing is performed at Long Island Jewish Medical Center's laboratories. The&#xD;
      physical examinations and laboratory findings are reviewed by each patient's psychiatrists.&#xD;
      Patients with physical or laboratory abnormalities are referred for care to internal medicine&#xD;
      specialists (i.e., general internal medicine, endocrinology, cardiology) in private practice&#xD;
      or to the appropriate outpatient clinics at Long Island Jewish Medical Center as deemed&#xD;
      necessary by their psychiatrists. At the present time, it is not known how many schizophrenia&#xD;
      patients with metabolic syndrome treated in the Aftercare Program (outpatient clinic) at ZHH&#xD;
      receive care according to the standard defined by the American Heart Association.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to evaluate the effect of application of AHA guidelines for the treatment of&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome in patients with schizophrenia who are receiving clozapine, an&#xD;
      antipsychotic known to produce weight gain and metabolic abnormalities in a majority of&#xD;
      patients (Newcomer, 2006). The study will include only outpatients receiving care in the&#xD;
      Clozapine Clinic. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study's primary aim is to compare the effectiveness of managing metabolic syndrome in&#xD;
      schizophrenia at the site of psychiatric outpatient services (integrated care) with treatment&#xD;
      obtained and coordinated by the patients Hillside psychiatrist (usual care). We propose that&#xD;
      Integrated care will remove access barriers, improve compliance, enhance communication&#xD;
      between psychiatry and internal medicine providers, and facilitate education for weight&#xD;
      management and smoking cessation. The management of metabolic syndrome for patients receiving&#xD;
      integrated care will adhere to the AHA guidelines (Grundy et al., 2005) which describe&#xD;
      dietary, exercise and pharmacologic interventions that have been extensively validated in the&#xD;
      general population. All of the medications suggested in the guidelines have been FDA-approved&#xD;
      for the individual components of metabolic syndrome. The 'usual care' group will receive the&#xD;
      current standard of care set by Hillside Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance of the Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first randomized trial of a &quot;no-barriers&quot; model of medical care for an&#xD;
      underserved and vulnerable mentally ill population. To increase homogeneity of the study&#xD;
      population and significance of the expected difference between integrated and usual care, the&#xD;
      study will assess only patients with the same psychiatric diagnosis (schizophrenia), treated&#xD;
      with the same psychotropic (clozapine) in a single, well-established outpatient setting. The&#xD;
      duration of the study is adequate to demonstrate whether the metabolic syndrome components&#xD;
      respond to life style modification and /or specific pharmacological intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Integrated, on-site, medical management of metabolic syndrome in patients with schizophrenia&#xD;
      is superior to usual care in the community, primarily because it will remove barriers related&#xD;
      to access to medical providers and increase compliance with drug therapy and laboratory&#xD;
      testing. The improvement will lead to decreased frequency of metabolic syndrome in the&#xD;
      sample, decreased risk of future ASCVD events (as predicted by AHA-recommended instruments),&#xD;
      decreased waist circumference, fasting glucose, blood pressure and triglyceride levels and&#xD;
      increased levels of HDL.&#xD;
