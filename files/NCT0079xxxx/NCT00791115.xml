      The purpose of this study is to compare the location of the cancer found in the prostate&#xD;
      gland after it is removed to the location that was predicted on the MRI scan during biopsy.&#xD;
      In this way, we can better determine if the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was accurate,&#xD;
      and if the MRI could be safely used to guide other types of treatments such as brachytherapy.&#xD;
      We also plan to carefully measure how frequently surgery is able to completely remove the&#xD;
      cancer, as well as the side effects and effectiveness of surgery after radiotherapy. The&#xD;
      study will be coordinated and closely integrated with a separate concurrent study of&#xD;
      MRI-guided prostate biopsy, which will be performed prior to accrual to this trial (UHN&#xD;
      05-0641-C).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two hundred and nineteen thousand new cases of prostate cancer have been projected in the&#xD;
      Unites States for 2007, with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) constituting the mainstay of&#xD;
      local therapy for an increasing proportion of newly diagnosed patients. Despite improvements&#xD;
      in the delivery and reduction in associated toxicity of external beam radiotherapy, local&#xD;
      persistence or recurrence of disease remains prevalent in 25-51% of patients. Local disease&#xD;
      after EBRT is a risk factor for subsequent metastatic progression and prostate&#xD;
      cancer-specific mortality, and is a cause of morbidity including hematuria, obstructive&#xD;
      uropathy, and chronic pain. Given its prevalence, and the lack of satisfactory local salvage&#xD;
      treatments, fear of prostate cancer recurrence has been shown to impose a substantial burden&#xD;
      of suffering in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stereotactic needle placement under MRI-guidance enables two critical steps in tumor-targeted&#xD;
      brachytherapy: 1) directly guiding brachytherapy catheters to sites of tumor recurrence, and&#xD;
      2) permitting treatment planning and delivery to be based on 3D MRI images. MRI-based HDR&#xD;
      brachytherapy will precisely identify the location of brachytherapy catheters relative to the&#xD;
      target volumes and adjacent normal structures at risk of radiation injury, obviating the need&#xD;
      for invasive saturation (24-100) mapping biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will build the evidence supporting the concept of tumor-targeted salvage HDR&#xD;
      brachytherapy, by providing further histopathological validation of the method.&#xD;
