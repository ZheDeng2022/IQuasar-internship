      The objective of this study is to compare the relative efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      SUBA™-Itraconazole Capsules (HalcyGen Ltd) to an already marketed oral formulation of&#xD;
      itraconazole SPORANOX® (itraconazole) capsules (Janssen Pharma) in the treatment of&#xD;
      onychomycosis of the toenail. Both the test and the reference formulations will also be&#xD;
      compared to a placebo formulation to test for superiority.&#xD;

      Randomized, Double-Blind, Multiple-Site, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel designed study&#xD;
      comparing a dosing regimen of 100 mg approximately 30 minutes prior to breakfast for 12 weeks&#xD;
      of SUBA™-Itraconazole 50 mg capsules (HalcyGen Ltd) to the approved dosing regimen of 200 mg&#xD;
      taken with breakfast of SPORANOX® (itraconazole) 100 mg capsules (Janssen Pharma). Patients&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned in a 3:3:1 ratio to the test product 100 mg once-a-day: reference&#xD;
      product 200 mg once-a-day: placebo once-a-day. respectively. The patients will complete 5&#xD;
      visits: baseline/screening (within 28 days of randomization), Day 1 (randomization), Week 6,&#xD;
      Week 12 and Week 24.&#xD;

    <description>All primary and secondary endpoints were tested for superiority against Placebo. The intent to treat (ITT) was used for all superiority testing. For the three primary endpoints and all four dichotomous secondary endpoints, if the difference between the proportion of patients considered a cure in the Test or Reference group was statistically greater (p &lt; 0.05) than the proportion of patients considered a cure in the Placebo group, then superiority of that treatment over placebo was considered to have been demonstrated. A one-sided continuity corrected Z-test was used for superiority testing.</description>

        <title>Superiority of Test Treatment Over Placebo for Mycological Cure</title>
        <description>All primary and secondary endpoints were tested for superiority against Placebo. The intent to treat (ITT) was used for all superiority testing. For the three primary endpoints and all four dichotomous secondary endpoints, if the difference between the proportion of patients considered a cure in the Test or Reference group was statistically greater (p &lt; 0.05) than the proportion of patients considered a cure in the Placebo group, then superiority of that treatment over placebo was considered to have been demonstrated. A one-sided continuity corrected Z-test was used for superiority testing.</description>
