  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the rate of chemotherapy: pemetrexed and cisplatin compared with the&#xD;
      combination of pemetrexed/cisplatin with MK-0646. The other purposes are to determine how&#xD;
      long we can control the cancer growth and toxicity and safety of the combination. Laboratory&#xD;
      research with the tumor tissue and blood obtained will be done to assess IGF-1R expression&#xD;
      and related markers and correlate with response and survival.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insulin-like Growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) is a tyrosine kinase receptor that regulates&#xD;
      cell growth, proliferation and apoptosis.(4) Increased IGF1 signaling results in upregulation&#xD;
      of proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis through RAF and PI3K pathways.(5) Several types&#xD;
      of cancer, including non-small cell lung cancer, express IGF-1R and its ligand. The&#xD;
      sequestration of IGF by IGF binding protein was associated with improved survival in patients&#xD;
      with resected stage I lung cancer.(6) High expression of IGF-1R is associated with poor&#xD;
      survival in surgically resected stage I lung cancer, specifically adenocarcinoma subtype.&#xD;
      Patients with adenocarcinoma and never smoker had higher expression of IGF-1R vs. squamous&#xD;
      cell carcinoma and smokers.(7). Low IGF-1R expression was associated with significant&#xD;
      improvement in survival in the adenocarcinoma lung cancer but there was a lack of correlation&#xD;
      between expression of IGF1R and survival in patients with squamous cell histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monoclonal antibodies target the extracellular domain of IGF-IR and small molecules inhibit&#xD;
      IGF-1R kinase. This is a potential new strategy in the treatment of lung cancer.&#xD;
