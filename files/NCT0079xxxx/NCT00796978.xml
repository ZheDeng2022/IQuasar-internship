    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, can block tumor growth in different&#xD;
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and&#xD;
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of trastuzumab and to see how well&#xD;
      it works in treating older women with early-stage breast cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the 3-year cumulative incidence of cardiac events in women 60 years and&#xD;
           older with HER2-positive breast cancer who receive single agent trastuzumab (Herceptin®)&#xD;
           in the adjuvant setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the 1-year cumulative incidence of asymptomatic cardiac left ventricular&#xD;
           dysfunction in women 60 years and older with Her2-positive breast cancer who receive&#xD;
           single agent trastuzumab in the adjuvant setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate long-term cardiac toxicity (5-year cumulative incidence of cardiac events)&#xD;
           in women 60 years and older with Her2-positive breast cancer who receive single agent&#xD;
           trastuzumab in the adjuvant setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the relation between physiologic markers of chronic heart failure and&#xD;
           trastuzumab-related cardiac dysfunction in women 60 years and older with Her2-positive&#xD;
           breast cancer who receive single agent trastuzumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the relation between pro-inflammatory cytokines and trastuzumab-related&#xD;
           cardiac dysfunction in women 60 years and older with Her2-positive breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effect of this drug on the health-related quality of life and&#xD;
           functional, cognitive, and mental status of women 60 years and older with Her2-positive&#xD;
           breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the 5-year disease-free survival and overall survival of women 60 years and&#xD;
           older with Her2-positive breast cancer who receive single agent trastuzumab in the&#xD;
           adjuvant setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive trastuzumab (Herceptin®) IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 3 weeks for up to 52 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood is collected every 6 weeks during treatment. Samples are assessed for plasma cardiac&#xD;
      markers (N-terminal brain natriuretic protein and troponin-I) and pro-inflammatory cytokines&#xD;
      (interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α). Patients complete Quality of Life and Quality of&#xD;
      Health and Comprehensive Geriatric assessments of functional, cognitive, and mental status&#xD;
      changes at baseline, weeks 26, and 52.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for 4 years.&#xD;
