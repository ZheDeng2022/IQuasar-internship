  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to to determine pharmacodynamic effects of a vaginal ring&#xD;
      delivering either 1,500 or 2,500 μg of CDB-2914 per day during 6 months of treatment on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. follicular function and inhibition of ovulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the endometrium&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. bleeding patterns; and also to assess safety including effects on the endometrium&#xD;
