  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bacterial vaginosis (BV), the world's most common vaginal infection, continues to cost&#xD;
      patients time, energy, comfort and money. BV is associated with increased incidence of&#xD;
      sexually transmitted infections (including HIV), spontaneous abortion, pre-term labour,&#xD;
      post-surgical infections, and endometritis. Current treatment for those women symptomatic for&#xD;
      BV includes both oral and intravaginal antibiotics, such as metronidazole, which have success&#xD;
      rates of 70-80 % at 1 month after treatment. These treatments also have high recurrence rates&#xD;
      (49-66 % at one year after treatment) and side effects (10-20 % of women) that include&#xD;
      secondary vaginal infection with candida. Intravaginal boric acid has been used for &gt;100&#xD;
      years for the treatment of vaginal infections and is quite commonly prescribed today as a&#xD;
      treatment for BV. It is cheap, easily accessible, easy to use, and is an effective treatment&#xD;
      of other vaginal infections, such as candida. To date, there are no clinical trials studying&#xD;
      the effectiveness of boric acid in the treatment of BV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study was to determine whether intravaginal BA is comparable to&#xD;
      standard treatment, metronidazole, for the cure of BV in symptomatic women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research question is: Among women 16-50 years old symptomatic with BV is intravaginal&#xD;
      treatment with BA non-inferior to metronidazole to achieve a Nugent score &lt;7 (cure) by day&#xD;
      17.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: H0: BA proportion of women cured &lt; metronidazole proportion of women cured - 10%.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A minimum of 240 volunteer women will be recruited through participating family practice&#xD;
      offices throughout British Columbia. Women with symptoms of BV, who also have a positive&#xD;
      whiff test/pH test or subsequent positive vaginal swab for BV, will be asked to participate.&#xD;
      Women will be included if they have both a positive test result for BV (whiff test/vaginal&#xD;
      swab) and if they have any symptoms of BV present. The following criteria must be met for&#xD;
      enrolment in the study: 1) ages 16-50 and pre-menopausal; 2) capable of giving written&#xD;
      informed consent; 3) fluent comprehension of spoken and written English; 4) negative&#xD;
      pregnancy test on enrolment day; 5) agree to follow study protocol; 6) documented BV&#xD;
      infection by positive vaginal swab (minimum Nugent score of 7/10) +/- positive whiff test/pH&#xD;
      &gt;4.5; 7) agree to no intercourse for the 10 days of treatment (or to use non-lubricated&#xD;
      condoms if unavoidable); 8) agree not to douche or use any intravaginal products during&#xD;
      treatment (including tampons, medications, devices); 9) abstain from alcohol during the 10&#xD;
      days of treatment (from 24 hours before through 72 hours after taking study medication); 10)&#xD;
      agree to no new medications or antibiotics during treatment; 11) no current sexually&#xD;
      transmitted infection as determined by history, physical exam and negative swabs for&#xD;
      chlamydia, gonorrhea, candidiasis, trichomonas; 12) patient is reliable for follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following women would be excluded from study participation: 1) less than 16 or&#xD;
      post-menopausal; 2) menstruating at diagnosis; 3) symptoms so severe as to make allocation to&#xD;
      placebo unacceptable to the patient; 4) currently pregnant or at high risk for pregnancy; 5)&#xD;
      current sexually transmitted infection (HIV, hepatitis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomonas,&#xD;
      HPV or HSV); 6) current yeast infection as determined by history, physical and swabs; 7)&#xD;
      history of PID; 8) allergy to latex or metronidazole; 9) presently breast feeding; 10) any&#xD;
      open wound, excoriation, vaginal irritation and including bartholin's cyst/abscess as&#xD;
      determined by physical exam; 11) presence of another vulvar, vaginal or medical condition,&#xD;
      including cervical neoplasia/treatment, that might confound treatment response; 12) using&#xD;
      lithium, anti-coagulants or disulfiram drugs; 13) any antifungal or antibiotic use 14 days&#xD;
      prior to enrolment 14) PAP smear done within one week of enrolment, 15) positive Whiff test,&#xD;
      but negative vaginal swab result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the initial visit, the physician will take a history and do a speculum and manual&#xD;
      pelvic exam for the woman. At the time of the pelvic exam the physician will ensure intact&#xD;
      mucous membranes and anatomy, take swabs for chlamydia and gonorrhea, bacterial vaginosis,&#xD;
      candidiasis, and trichomonas, and perform a whiff test using a provided, standardized 10% KOH&#xD;
      potassium hydroxide solution. Vaginal discharge will also have pH testing done. If the whiff&#xD;
      test is positive and the vaginal discharge pH is &gt;4.5, the woman will then take a urine&#xD;
      pregnancy test, will be informed about the study, and will be given a handout explaining the&#xD;
      study and the 3 possible treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the woman is interested in participating she will be given a &quot;Study Intake Survey&quot; to fill&#xD;
      out, a consent form to sign, and an assigned number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within a few days, the physician would confirm participation, eligibility and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria and collect the signed consent form. The patient will then be given a blinded,&#xD;
      controlled and randomized treatment pack containing 10 capsules compounded and organized by a&#xD;
      pharmacist. The patient will be given a package containing: 1) capsule applicators; 2) pads;&#xD;
      3) non-lubricated condoms; 4) a diary to record their daily use of the treatment, any&#xD;
      problems or side effects, any symptom changes, or any problems with maintaining the study&#xD;
      agreements; 5) information sheet outlining follow up instructions and emergency contact&#xD;
      numbers to reach the study members. If the woman does not want to join the study the&#xD;
      physician will prescribe a standard treatment of their choosing and would follow up as usual.&#xD;
      If the whiff test is negative but the vaginal swab is found to be positive for bacterial&#xD;
      vaginosis as per the Nugent score (score minimum of 7/10), the woman will be called back in&#xD;
      to the office. If her symptoms are found to be persistant at this juncture, then she will be&#xD;
      offered to enroll in the study or may elect to start a treatment of her physician's choosing.&#xD;
      If the woman prefers to take some time to decide about the study, she will be given the&#xD;
      information package, the survey form, and consent form to take home, as well as a&#xD;
      prescription for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. She can then return the next day with&#xD;
      the forms filled out should she decide she would like to enroll in the study and be assigned&#xD;
      a treatment arm. If she chooses not to enroll, she can fill the above-mentioned prescription&#xD;
      and start the treatment for BV provided by her physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The women who satisfy the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be blindly and randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of 3 treatments (minimum of 80 women per treatment arm): 1) placebo&#xD;
      (emollient cream); 2) boric acid (600 mg boric acid in emollient cream); 3) metronidazole 10&#xD;
      % intravaginal cream (Sanofi-Aventis Canada Inc Product DIN 01926861) (for a total of 37.5 mg&#xD;
      metronidazole) ). The treatments will be taken at night prior to sleep using the provided&#xD;
      applicators for 10 days. The patient will be instructed to use a provided pads during the day&#xD;
      and night for any discharge or fluid. The patient will record daily in a diary (provided)&#xD;
      about compliance, side effects and problems, and changes in symptoms over the 10 days. The&#xD;
      patient will be welcome to call the provided emergency numbers of the study members for any&#xD;
      questions or problems related to the treatment. On day 5 of the treatment, the patient will&#xD;
      receive a call or email from a study member to ask follow up questions about compliance, side&#xD;
      effects, BV symptoms, and satisfaction of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On both follow up visits: days 17-19 (one week after the treatment end) and 40-42 (one month&#xD;
      after the treatment end), the participant will return to the clinic that enrolled her for&#xD;
      reassessment, pregnancy test, and follow up examination including pelvic exam and repeat&#xD;
      swabs. It will be noted whether her BV symptoms are still present, and if she had any side&#xD;
      effects or problems during treatment. The participant returns her daily treatment diary on&#xD;
      day 17 visit as well.&#xD;
