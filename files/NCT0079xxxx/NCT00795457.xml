  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot vaccine study in adults with either WHO grade II astrocytoma,&#xD;
      oligoastrocytoma or oligodendroglioma. The purpose of this study is test the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of an experimental tumor vaccine made from peptides and Montanide ISA-51 in&#xD;
      combination with the study drug Poly-ICLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Poly-ICLC, manufactured by Oncovir, Inc., has already been received and generally well&#xD;
      tolerated by subjects in earlier studies and has been shown to decrease the size of brain&#xD;
      tumors in some cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immunological and safety data will be used to decide whether a larger study of clinical&#xD;
      efficacy is warranted in each of two patient cohorts.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients on the study will be followed for a minimum of 2 years, so that the actual&#xD;
      2-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates can be determined in&#xD;
      an exploratory manner.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have documented pathological diagnosis of a WHO grade II astrocytoma&#xD;
             or oligoastrocytoma or oligodendroglioma (see also the 4th bullet for&#xD;
             oligodendroglioma).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HLA-A2 positive based on flow cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There will be 2 cohorts of patients based on whether patients have received prior RT.&#xD;
             Cohort 1: patients must have undergone surgery or biopsy alone ≤16 weeks prior to&#xD;
             study entry (no postoperative radiation or chemotherapy). Cohort 2: Patients received&#xD;
             surgery or biopsy and radiation therapy (RT) (including fractionated external beam&#xD;
             radiation therapy and/or stereotactic radiosurgery), which was completed ≥6 months&#xD;
             prior to enrollment, and have a baseline MRI scan (within 4 weeks of the first&#xD;
             vaccine) that shows stable disease or regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For oligodendroglioma, at least one of the following three conditions has to be met:&#xD;
             1) age ≥ 40 with any extent resection; 2) age 18-39 with incomplete resection (post-op&#xD;
             MRI showing &gt; 1cm residual disease, based on the maximum dimension of residual T2 or&#xD;
             FLAIR abnormality from the edge of the surgical cavity either laterally,&#xD;
             antero-posteriorly, or supero-inferiorly) or 3) age 18-39 with neurosurgeon-defined&#xD;
             GTR but the tumor size is ≥ 4 cm (the maximum preoperative tumor diameter, based on&#xD;
             the axial and/or coronal T2 or FLAIR MR images). Participants must be ≥ 18 years old&#xD;
             because the safety of each therapeutic component has not been established in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All participants must sign an informed consent document indicating that they are aware&#xD;
             of the investigational nature of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have a Karnofsky performance status of &gt; 60 (Appendix I).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented negative serum beta HCG for female participants of child-bearing age. Males&#xD;
             and females must agree, in the consent form, to use effective birth control methods&#xD;
             during the course of vaccination. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for&#xD;
             adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with the&#xD;
             peptide based vaccine and poly-ICLC, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be free of systemic infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with adequate organ function as measured by white blood count ≥ 2500/mm3;&#xD;
             lymphocytes ≥ 800/mm3; platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3, hemoglobin ≥ 10.0 g/dL, AST, ALT, GGT,&#xD;
             LDH, alkaline phosphatase within 2.5 x upper normal limit, and total bilirubin greater&#xD;
             than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL, and serum creatinine within 1.5 X upper limit of normal&#xD;
             limit. Coagulation tests PT and PTT have to be within normal limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of cranial or spinal leptomeningeal metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior chemotherapy or anti-glioma therapy of any type other than radiation therapy&#xD;
             (see 3.1.3)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent treatment or medications including:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Radiation therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Interferon&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Allergy desensitization injections&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Growth factors&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Interleukins&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any investigational therapeutic medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must not have had prior autoimmune disorders requiring cytotoxic or&#xD;
             immunosuppressive therapy, or autoimmune disorders with visceral involvement.&#xD;
             Participants with an active autoimmune disorder requiring these therapies are also&#xD;
             excluded. Mild arthritis requiring NSAID medications will not be exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of immunosuppressives within 4 weeks prior to study entry or anticipated use of&#xD;
             immunosuppressive agents. Dexamethasone, or other corticosteroid medications, if used&#xD;
             perioperative period and/or during radiotherapy, must be tapered and discontinued at&#xD;
             least 4 weeks before administration of the first vaccine. Topical corticosteroids and&#xD;
             Inhaled steroids are acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have another cancer diagnosis, except that the following diagnoses&#xD;
             will be allowed:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  squamous cell cancer of the skin without known metastasis&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  basal cell cancer of the skin without known metastasis&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  carcinoma in situ of the breast (DCIS or LCIS)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  carcinoma in situ of the cervix&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  any cancer without distant metastasis that has been treated successfully, without&#xD;
                  evidence of recurrence or metastasis for over 5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known addiction to alcohol or any drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because patients with immune deficiency are not expected to respond to this therapy,&#xD;
             HIV positive patients are excluded from the study.&#xD;
