    <textblock>
      To investigate if topical amitriptyline 2%, ketamine 1%, and lidocaine 5% in pluronic&#xD;
      lecitine organogel (AKL in PLO gel) can improve management of neuropathic pain from radiation&#xD;
      skin reactions adjunctively or better than standard treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. Topical amitriptyline and ketamine and topical lidocaine alone have been shown to&#xD;
           improve management of neuropathic pain in nonmalignant subjects. Anecdotal experience&#xD;
           has shown improvement in use of all three topical drugs combined in radiation skin&#xD;
           reactions. There currently is no research evidence for the use of all three compounded&#xD;
           interventions. This study aims to target subjects with pain from radiation therapy who&#xD;
           are not receiving adequate relief with standard interventions and may be eligible to&#xD;
           receive this alternate intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypothesis:Topical AKL in PLO gel can effectively and safely reduce neuropathic pain&#xD;
           experienced by patients with radiotherapy induced skin reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Justification: Standard treatment of painful radiation skin reactions such as moist&#xD;
           desquamation consists of saline soaks, silver sulfadiazine and oral analgesics. However,&#xD;
           sometimes the pain exceeds this standard intervention, patients are sulfa allergic or&#xD;
           patients are intolerant to oral analgesics such as opioids. AKL in PLO gel is targeted&#xD;
           for neuropathic pain and may be used alternatively to standard interventions. The&#xD;
           participation rate will help to further estimate the feasibility of a larger sample size&#xD;
           study to look at efficacy.&#xD;
