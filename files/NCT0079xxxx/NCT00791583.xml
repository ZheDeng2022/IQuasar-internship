    <textblock>
      Central line associated bloodstream infection (CL-ABI) is an important and preventable cause&#xD;
      of nosocomial infections and is responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality. It is&#xD;
      estimated that 5 to 26% of patients experience an infectious complication from their central&#xD;
      venous catheter [1]. In the United States, it is estimated that nearly 50,000 patients&#xD;
      develop central line associated bloodstream infections in the ICUs annually, at a rate of&#xD;
      approximately 5 infections per 1000 catheter days [2] and as many as 15,000 deaths annually.&#xD;
      Central line associated bloodstream infections are also associated with increased hospital&#xD;
      and ICU lengths of stay in the ICU (2). Estimates of the cost of CL-ABI to hospitals range&#xD;
      from $25,000 to $65,000 per patient [3, 4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Centers for Disease Control have published guidelines for the prevention of CL-ABI that&#xD;
      represent a collaborative effort by a multidisciplinary coalition of professional&#xD;
      organizations that provide evidence based recommendations to prevent catheter related&#xD;
      infections [5]. The interventions emphasize five distinct practices, including: education and&#xD;
      training of healthcare providers who place and care for catheters, utilizing maximum sterile&#xD;
      barrier precautions during catheter placement, skin preparation using 2% chlorhexidine,&#xD;
      avoiding routine replacement of central lines as a strategy to reduce infection, and using&#xD;
      antiseptic or antibiotic coated lines in the event that infection rates remain high despite&#xD;
      adherence to the above measures [5].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have demonstrated impressive reductions in CL-ABI from the application of&#xD;
      these strategies, ranging from 18 to 100% reductions and realizing significant reductions in&#xD;
      mortality and cost [2]. The simple introduction of maximum sterile barrier precautions to&#xD;
      insert central lines has been observed to dramatically reduce infection rates for over a&#xD;
      decade [6]. However, the CDC's guidelines, despite their seeming simplicity, have been found&#xD;
      to be frequently insufficiently applied, whether by ignorance or omission [2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past 12 months there have been a total 24 documented central venous line (CVL)&#xD;
      infections at SLRHC with cumulative rate of infection of 3.8 per 1000 central line days.&#xD;
      These infection rate figures are above the benchmark experience. For SLRHC the cost incurred&#xD;
      over the past 12 months is estimated to be $1,080,000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training and education of healthcare personnel and the utilization of maximum sterile&#xD;
      precautions are two important areas. Residents still most frequently learn central line&#xD;
      placement techniques by the &quot;see one, do one, teach one&quot; method, which by its very definition&#xD;
      allows for a multitude of techniques in practice. While this teaching theoretically includes&#xD;
      the utilization of maximal sterile precautions for central line placement, the focus of&#xD;
      teaching, and of residents' anxieties, is most often focused on the proper placement of the&#xD;
      line, not the sterile technique used to place it. In emergency medicine, residents also&#xD;
      frequently learn procedures in an emergent environment- where attention to maximum sterile&#xD;
      precautions may be less than ideal. Guzzo et al found in particular that mentors of trainees&#xD;
      performing CVC placements in both emergent and non-emergent situations were significantly&#xD;
      less likely to consistently utilize maximum sterile precautions [8]. Furthermore, in a study&#xD;
      of a video-based training on sterile technique in CVC insertion in a trauma resuscitation&#xD;
      unit that evaluated only non-emergent CVC placements, a total of 5 cases of central-&#xD;
      catheter- related bacteremia were reported on just 68 patients, and even with video based&#xD;
      training, 26% of residents continued to have infractions in their compliance with sterile&#xD;
      precautions [9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical simulators allow residents to practice skills in a realistic and interactive&#xD;
      environment that minimizes risk to patients. Studies have found simulation to be an effective&#xD;
      means for teaching skills as diverse as ACLS and airway management to laparoscopic surgical&#xD;
      skills [10,11,12]. Additionally, the use of audio-visual equipment in a medical simulator to&#xD;
      record a resident's performance gives valuable firsthand feedback that is otherwise not&#xD;
      available, as it allows residents to visualize their own missteps [13]. This is hypothesized&#xD;
      to be of particular value in the proper acquisition of physical skills such as maximum&#xD;
      sterile precautions. Furthermore, the Society for Academic Medicine has recently published a&#xD;
      consensus paper outlining a research agenda for the use of simulation in Emergency Medicine&#xD;
      that identifies procedural training as a priority area and notes that it is &quot;an incompletely&#xD;
      tested assessment method for the range of procedural skills required of emergency physicians&#xD;
      [14].&quot; The paper goes on to state that:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Competency&quot; must be defined precisely for every procedure. Each step must be identified, and&#xD;
      the proper sequence of those steps must be established. Objective checklists and expert&#xD;
      scoring systems must be created, and training and assessment methodologies must be validated.&#xD;
      [14] With this in mind, the Department of Emergency Medicine has recently approved a training&#xD;
      policy in aseptic technique during central venous access placement (see attached copy). All&#xD;
      EM residents will be trained in MBP techniques in the Sim Lab. Training will include baseline&#xD;
      assessment of residents skills in maintaining maximum sterile precautions using a&#xD;
      standardized scoring tool, videotape training, short exam, and individual simulated&#xD;
      debriefing on performance of correct MBP with follow up assessment and training as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to collect data prospectively on all EM residents who will undergo evaluation and&#xD;
      training in maximum barrier precaution during CVC placement. Data will be reviewed and&#xD;
      analyzed for future research publication&#xD;
