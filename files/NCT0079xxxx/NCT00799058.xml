      A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase I/II trial to evaluate the safety of&#xD;
      dapivirine Gel 4759, 0.05% 2.5 g and dapivirine Gel 4789, 0.05% 2.5 g formulations as&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, to be conducted over 10 months&#xD;
      at five research centers in the USA among 180 healthy, sexually active women, to assess the&#xD;
      safety and acceptability of dapivirine Gel 4759, 0.05% 2.5 g, and dapivirine Gel 4789, 0.05%&#xD;
      2.5 g, both vaginal microbicides containing dapivirine, compared to the vaginal HEC-based&#xD;
      Universal placebo gel, 2.5 g, containing no active ingredient, used once daily for a period&#xD;
      of 12 weeks.&#xD;
