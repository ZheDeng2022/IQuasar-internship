  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a difference in the ocular signs and&#xD;
      symptoms of subjects' eyes using Xalatan® 0.005% versus Travatan Z® 0.004% based on the&#xD;
      outcome of subject assessment and clinical assessment in patients with Ocular Hypertension or&#xD;
      Glaucoma with mild to moderate dry eye at baseline in accordance with the Oxford Grading&#xD;
      Scale.&#xD;
