      OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study is to further assess safety and efficacy data&#xD;
      of the bortezomib/melphalan/prednisone (BMP) regimen in previously untreated and transplant&#xD;
      ineligible multiple myeloma patients. This is an international, multicentred, open-label,&#xD;
      single-arm, non-comparative study. After providing written informed consent, patients will be&#xD;
      evaluated for eligibility during a screening period of 14 days (Days -14 to Day -1). Baseline&#xD;
      efficacy and safety assessments will be performed on Day 1 (the first day of treatment) prior&#xD;
      to the study drug administration for patients with measurable monoclonal paraprotein&#xD;
      (M-protein) or within at least 14 days for patients with extramedullary plasmacytomas.&#xD;
      Patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not candidates for high dose&#xD;
      chemotherapy with stem cell transplant high dose therapy/stem cell transplant (HDT/SCT) will&#xD;
      be enrolled. Approximately 150 patients will be enrolled on study. Patients will receive BMP&#xD;
      treatment, consisting of Bortezomib (twice weekly [Days 1, 4, 8, 11, 22, 25, 29 and 32] for&#xD;
      four 6-week cycles [8 doses per cycle] followed by once weekly [Days 1, 8, 22, and 29] for&#xD;
      five 6-week cycles [4 doses per cycle]) in combination with melphalan and prednisone once&#xD;
      daily on Days 1 to 4 of each 6-week cycle. Treatment will continue for a maximum of 9 cycles&#xD;
      (54 weeks) and will be discontinued if disease progression or an unacceptable&#xD;
      treatment-related toxicity occurs, or if a patient withdraws consent. The Final Visit/Early&#xD;
      Termination Visit will occur 30-42 days after the last dose of Bortezomib. Investigators will&#xD;
      be asked to report on TTP every 6 months from Final Visit until disease progression for a&#xD;
      period of up to 2 years. Safety will be assessed by the monitoring of adverse events,&#xD;
      physical (including neurological/peripheral neurological) examinations, vital sign&#xD;
      measurements, hematology and clinical chemistry tests. Karnofsky performance status and&#xD;
      FACT/GOG-Ntx will also be assessed. Efficacy evaluations of serum and urine M-protein levels&#xD;
      together with extramedullary plasmacytoma evaluations will be done at the beginning of each&#xD;
      cycle. Investigator reported TTP and subsequent therapy will also be captured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to assess neurotoxicity using the FACT/GOG-Ntx questionnaire,&#xD;
      and to capture investigator reported time to progression (TTP) data. STUDY POPULATION: The&#xD;
      patient population comprises a maximum of 150 male and female patients, who have symptomatic&#xD;
      multiple myeloma or asymptomatic multiple myeloma with related organ or tissue damage,&#xD;
      presence of measurable disease, Karnofsky performance status score greater than or equal to&#xD;
      60 points, and clinical hematology and chemistry laboratory values that meet predefined&#xD;
      criteria. It is expected that approximately 150 patients will be enrolled. Potential patients&#xD;
      will be excluded who are candidates for HDT/SCT; have a diagnosis of smoldering multiple&#xD;
      myeloma, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), or Waldenstr√∂m's disease;&#xD;
      have had prior or current systemic therapy for multiple myeloma; have had radiation therapy,&#xD;
      plasmapheresis, or major surgery within 30 days before study entry; or have peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy or neuropathic pain Grade 2 or higher. EFFICACY EVALUTIONS: Measurements of&#xD;
      M-protein will be followed in serum and 24-hour urine at baseline (prior to treatment on Day&#xD;
      1 of Cycle 1), prior to treatment on Day 1 of Cycles 2-9, and at the Final Visit. The Final&#xD;
      Visit/Early Termination Visit will occur 30-42 days after the last dose of Bortezomib. It is&#xD;
      recommended that patients who have 100% disappearance of the original monoclonal protein from&#xD;
      serum and urine will have the result confirmed by immunofixation. Investigators will also be&#xD;
      asked to complete a CRF follow-up form every 6 months for up to 2 years after the Final/Early&#xD;
      Termination Visit to capture TTP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY EVALUATIONS: A physical examination (including neurological/peripheral neurological&#xD;
      examination, vital signs, blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and temperature),&#xD;
      karnofsky performance status, hematology, and clinical chemistry tests will be obtained at&#xD;
      screening; on Day 1 of each cycle prior to dosing with Bortezomib; and at the Final&#xD;
      Visit/Early Termination Visit to occur 30-42 days after the last dose of Bortezomib is&#xD;
      administered. Hematology tests will also be obtained prior to dosing during cycles 1 and 2&#xD;
      and every week thereafter. Safety will also be assessed by the reporting of adverse events&#xD;
      starting with the signing of the ICF, during treatment, and until the last study related&#xD;
      procedure at the Final Visit/Early Termination Visit. The intensity (severity) of the adverse&#xD;
      events will be assessed using National Cancer Institute (NCI) common toxicity criteria (CTC)&#xD;
      Version 3.0. All adverse events (excluding grade 1 and 2 lab abnormalities) starting with the&#xD;
      signing of the ICF, during and until the Final Visit/Early Termination Visit will be recorded&#xD;
      on the case report forms (CRFs). Clinically relevant changes in laboratory safety tests,&#xD;
      vital signs, and physical/neurological examinations will be recorded as adverse events.&#xD;
      Serious adverse events will be reported within 24 hours of knowledge of the event by any&#xD;
      member of the investigational site to the sponsor by facsimile (fax), using an SAE form,&#xD;
      which will be provided by the sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY ANALYSIS: Adverse events, serious adverse events, M-protein, extramedullary&#xD;
      plasmacytoma measurements, FACT/GOG-Ntx and Karnofsky performance status data will be&#xD;
      summarized. Response to study treatment based on M-protein and extramedullary plasmacytoma&#xD;
      reduction will also be assessed in the analysis. Patients will receive BMP treatment,&#xD;
      consisting of Bortezomib IV bolus infusion 1.3m^2 (twice weekly [Days 1, 4, 8, 11, 22, 25, 29&#xD;
      and 32] for four 6-week cycles [8 doses per cycle]) followed by once weekly [Days 1, 8, 22,&#xD;
      and 29] for five 6-week cycles [4 doses per cycle]) in combination with oral melphalan&#xD;
      9mg/m^2 and oral prednisone 60 mg/m^2 once daily on Days 1 to 4 of each 6-week cycle. The max&#xD;
      total treatment duration of the study is 54-weeks (9 six-week cycles).&#xD;
