      RATIONALE: Sunitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying sunitinib to see how well it works as second-line&#xD;
      therapy in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic transitional cell cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the objective tumor response rate according to RECIST criteria in patients&#xD;
           with locally advanced or metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium&#xD;
           treated with sunitinib malate who failed or progressed after first-line chemotherapy .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety of this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the time to response and duration of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the progression-free survival and overall survival of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the quality of life of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily for 4 weeks. Courses repeat every 6 weeks&#xD;
      for 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 2 months.&#xD;
