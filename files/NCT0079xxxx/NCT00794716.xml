    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the predictive value of NRL972 pharmacokinetics in the diagnosis of&#xD;
      steatohepatitis using fatty liver disease as the comparator group. In addition, the&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity of NRL972 pharmacokinetics as a diagnostic tool will be compared&#xD;
      to results from the standard laboratory tests, elastography, tests of metabolic markers and&#xD;
      serum fibrosis markers frequently used in the evaluation of clinically predicted NAFLD&#xD;
      patients. Patients will be included if they have clinical evidence of fatty liver disease and&#xD;
      have been referred to the clinic for a diagnostic work-up, including a liver biopsy, blood&#xD;
      tests and scans of the liver.&#xD;
