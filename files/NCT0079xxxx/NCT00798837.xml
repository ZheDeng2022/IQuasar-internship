    <textblock>
      This trial uses a type of radiotherapy called intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), which&#xD;
      is able to deliver the radiation to the prostate while delivering less dose to the&#xD;
      surrounding normal organs compared with standard 3D conformal radiotherapy presently used at&#xD;
      the BCCA. This trial will use RapidArc IMRT, which is a new way of delivering IMRT, where the&#xD;
      radiation dose is delivered in a single rotation of the radiotherapy machine around the&#xD;
      patient. This new method of delivering IMRT has been shown to be at least as good as&#xD;
      conventional IMRT at delivering the dose, and takes less time to do so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to deliver a higher radiation dose to the prostate gland than the&#xD;
      standard treatment while not increasing dose to the normal organs. In this way, it is hoped&#xD;
      that the likelihood of the cancer coming back will be reduced without causing an increase in&#xD;
      side-effects.&#xD;

    <description>There is only one arm in this study.&#xD;
Each patient will undergo a course of intensity modulated external beam radiation therapy (IMRT) using RapidArc for optimization and delivery.&#xD;
Doses of radiotherapy are as follows:&#xD;
The prescription dose will be 73.7 Gy in 28 fractions.&#xD;
A simultaneous intraprostatic maximal simultaneous boost will be given to as much of the CTV as possible without contravening OAR dose constraints.</description>

&#xD;
          2. Registration must occur within 26 weeks of biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History and physical examination (including digital rectal examination (DRE)) within 8&#xD;
             weeks prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have intermediate risk prostate cancer, as defined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  PSA ≤ 20 ng/ml,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Gleason ≤ 7,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Stage ≤ T2c, and&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Do not meet criteria for low-risk prostate cancer (Low-risk = All of: PSA ≤ 10 +&#xD;
                  Gleason ≤ 6 + stage ≤ T2b)&#xD;
&#xD;
