  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vaccination is the principal means of combating epidemic and pandemic influenza. As vaccines&#xD;
      induce relatively strain-specific and short-lived antibody responses, annual immunisation&#xD;
      with regularly updated vaccine is recommended for seasonal influenza, but would not be&#xD;
      expected to protect against a pandemic event. In clinical trials among young adults, at least&#xD;
      two doses of avian influenza H5 or H9 subunit vaccine are needed to induce moderate antibody&#xD;
      responses. However, studies including older subjects have unexpectedly found that some people&#xD;
      aged over 65 yrs have pre-vaccination neutralising antibody to influenza H5 and H9&#xD;
      respectively. These subjects mount a robust antibody response to single dose H5 or H9&#xD;
      pandemic vaccine, suggesting that they are effectively primed to at least some strains of&#xD;
      avian influenza.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This exploratory proposal focuses on those elderly subjects whose immune systems already&#xD;
      exhibit antibodies to H5 with a goal of investigating the humoral and cellular basis of the&#xD;
      immune response to seasonal and pandemic vaccination. We will examine neutralising antibody&#xD;
      responses to a range of human and non-human influenza viruses before and after seasonal and&#xD;
      pandemic vaccination and evaluate cellular B and T cell immune responses before and after&#xD;
      pandemic H5 vaccination&#xD;

      STUDY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunological objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate heterosubtypic neutralising antibody to influenza viruses in older people&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate heterosubtypic neutralising antibody responses to human and non-human&#xD;
           influenza viruses following seasonal influenza vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate homologous and heterosubtypic neutralising antibody responses to human and&#xD;
           non-human influenza viruses after MF59-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate cellular B and T cell responses to influenza H5 in non-exposed subjects who&#xD;
           exhibit anti-H5 neutralising antibodies before and after seasonal (TIV) or pandemic H5&#xD;
           vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify epitopes on the influenza haemagglutinin to which anti-H5 neutralising&#xD;
           antibodies in sera from non-exposed subjects are directed Safety Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate safety of one or two IM doses of MF59-adjuvanted A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1)&#xD;
           influenza vaccine, containing 7.5 μg of H5 antigen in adult subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate safety of one IM dose of seasonal influenza vaccine, containing 15 μg of H1,&#xD;
           H3 and B antigen in adult subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heterosubtypic cross reacting antibodies to influenza exist in some elderly subjects and&#xD;
           can be boosted by a single dose of (a) seasonal TIV or (b) pandemic influenza&#xD;
           vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heterosubtypic cross reacting antibodies to influenza do not exist in younger subjects&#xD;
           and cannot be induced by (a) seasonal TIV or (b) pandemic influenza vaccination&#xD;
