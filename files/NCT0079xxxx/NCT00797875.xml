      Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation（PNF） is defined as a treatment method that promotes&#xD;
      or hastens the response of the neuromuscular mechanism through stimulation of proprioceptors&#xD;
      within the related muscles or joints. PNF stretching technique is a therapeutic technique&#xD;
      using the PNF concept to the related muslces either to increase neuro-inhibition mechanism&#xD;
      for releasing muscle spasm and elongating muscle length, or to increase neuro-excitation&#xD;
      mechanism for enhancing muscle strength. Improvement in range of motion using PNF stretching&#xD;
      technique has been reported superior to other techniques in previous literature, but those&#xD;
      studies have only been done in healthy adults. Less is known in the effect of PNF stretching&#xD;
      on improvement in joint restriction. Range of motion limitation usually disturbed the&#xD;
      patients with total knee arthroplasty. PNF stretching techniques has been used frequently for&#xD;
      patients with total knee arthroplasty in clinical practice to increase range of motion&#xD;
      effectively and reduced knee pain during exercise. However there is no evidence-based&#xD;
      research in such a technique for patients with total knee arthroplasty. This research&#xD;
      project, therefore, will explore application of PNF stretch in changes of knee flexion, pain,&#xD;
      muscle strength, and function of the lower extremity following total knee arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purposes： To investigate immediate and short term effects on angle of knee flexion, intensity&#xD;
      of pain, strength of the knee extensor, and function of the lower extremity by using PNF&#xD;
      stretching technique in patients with total knee arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method： Sixty patients who received total knee arthroplasty in National Taiwan University&#xD;
      Hospital will be recruited in this study. They will be allocated randomly into either&#xD;
      experimental or control groups. Conventional physical therapy will be given to all&#xD;
      participants. Besides, the experimental group will assume PNF stretching technique from the&#xD;
      third post-operative day to the day of discharge. This technique will be executed by the same&#xD;
      physical therapist, including 5 trials of isometric knee extension for 6 s, followed by&#xD;
      active knee flexion to the maximum range immediately, and holding for 10s. The rest interval&#xD;
      will be 10 s. For the control group, passive stretch technique with the same treatment time&#xD;
      will be given, instead. All participants will be asked to do home exercises after discharged&#xD;
      from the hospital. The outcome measures will be given before and after the first session&#xD;
      treatment on the same day, on the day of discharge, and one month after the operation. The&#xD;
      variables measured will be (1) knee flexion angle measured with a universal goniometer, (2)&#xD;
      maximum voluntary isometric strength of the knee extensor measured with a hand-held&#xD;
      dynamometer, (3) pain score using pain visual analog scale, (4) function performance of the&#xD;
      lower extremity measured with timed up and go test, (5) Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis&#xD;
      Outcome Score (KOOS) to record 5 dimensions including the symptoms, stiffness, pain,&#xD;
      difficulties in knee functions and/or daily activities, limitations in sports or recreational&#xD;
      participation, and quality of life.&#xD;
