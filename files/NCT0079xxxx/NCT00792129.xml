    <textblock>
      This study is being undertaken to compare the clinical outcomes of patients that have&#xD;
      unilateral posterolateral lumbar interbody fusion using a traditional open approach versus&#xD;
      the MiLIF procedure based on the MiCOR Precision Bone Allograft, specialized Atavi&#xD;
      instrumentation, and minimally invasive visualization capabilities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized cohort design clinical study to evaluate&#xD;
      the clinical outcomes of patients that have a minimally invasive lumbar interbody fusion&#xD;
      (MiLIF) through the Atavi system compared to traditional unilateral open lumbar interbody&#xD;
      fusion through a midline incision. the study will involve up to approximately 12&#xD;
      investigational sites and enroll up to 126 patients.&#xD;

The Atavi System includes instruments used to access the spine by dilation of the overlying tissues, as well as a retracting device that is used to maintain the access. Once the retractor is in place, the visualization components of the system may be used.</description>

    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Patients with chronic low back and/or leg pain who are candiates for elective lumbar&#xD;
        interbody fusion through a postierior unilateral approach, that present to either group of&#xD;
        surgeons, will be screened for inclusion in the study. If the patient meets all of the&#xD;
        eligibility criteria, they wil be enrolled into the study and have either the MiLIF or open&#xD;
        procedure depending on the surgoen they present to (i.e., what group their surgeon agreed&#xD;
        to participate in).&#xD;
