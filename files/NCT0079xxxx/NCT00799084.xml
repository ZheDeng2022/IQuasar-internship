    <textblock>
      To improve the management of symptoms, patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy will be&#xD;
      monitored using an automated telephone system to record the severity of 15 prevalent symptoms&#xD;
      for up to 8 consecutive weeks. Outcomes include; significant reduction in symptom severity&#xD;
      and improvement in health states.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overview: Prevalent symptoms among patients undergoing chemotherapy include: pain, fatigue,&#xD;
      dry mouth, constipation, anorexia, nausea, sleep disturbance, shortness of breath or&#xD;
      difficulty breathing, as well as psychological symptoms such as depression and anxiety. A&#xD;
      survey of 1000 patients with cancer indicated that close to a quarter reported 10-12&#xD;
      symptoms. Given the impact of symptoms upon physical function, work, emotional distress, and&#xD;
      hospitalizations, it is critical that strategies be developed and tested to improve symptom&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial of a behavioural intervention for symptom management is significant because: 1) it&#xD;
      contrasts a proactive approach, individualized to patients' symptom management needs, with a&#xD;
      more conventional model that places responsibility on the patient for symptom management; 2)&#xD;
      it controls for the method of delivery and the use of printed material; 3) it targets&#xD;
      prevalent symptoms known to affect cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy; 4) it examines&#xD;
      the relative effects of each arm, in terms of symptom severity (primary outcome), impact on&#xD;
      patients' physical and social roles, and emotional distress; and 5) it explores these&#xD;
      outcomes in terms of their impact on the use of services and costs of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal: The goal of this randomized trial is to determine if a nurse delivered Patient Assisted&#xD;
      Management of Symptoms (PAMS) intervention individualized to patients' needs for symptom&#xD;
      management, delivered by telephone, when compared to Telephone Information and Monitoring of&#xD;
      Symptoms (TIMS) where symptoms are only monitored by telephone, with references to the&#xD;
      symptom management toolkit will reduce symptom severity, improve physical function, and other&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
