  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High blood pressure and high cholesterol are both causes of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and&#xD;
      it is important for people with these conditions to adhere to their medication regimens. This&#xD;
      study will evaluate the effectiveness of a computerized program that provides individualized&#xD;
      feedback to participants and their doctors for increasing medication adherence among people&#xD;
      at risk of developing CVD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CVD is a disorder that affects the heart's ability to function normally. The most common&#xD;
      cause of CVD is narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the&#xD;
      heart. There are many risk factors for CVD, including inflammation, high blood pressure, high&#xD;
      cholesterol, and obesity. For people who take blood pressure and cholesterol lowering&#xD;
      medications, adherence to their medication regimen is another important factor in reducing&#xD;
      the risk of CVD. Currently, there are no programs available to assist patients with tracking&#xD;
      their medication adherence, despite the fact that non-adherence is a major reason for&#xD;
      elevated cholesterol and blood pressure levels. This study will evaluate a computerized&#xD;
      medication adherence system (MAS) that provides individualized reports to participants and&#xD;
      their doctors with information on identifying and overcoming barriers to medication&#xD;
      adherence. The MAS will be evaluated in conjunction with counseling from participants'&#xD;
      doctors. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a computerized MAS&#xD;
      plus counseling from doctors for increasing medication adherence and lowering blood pressure&#xD;
      and cholesterol levels among people at risk of CVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This 1-year study will enroll people with high blood pressure or cholesterol levels who are&#xD;
      at risk of CVD. At a baseline study visit, participants will undergo blood pressure&#xD;
      measurements, a blood collection, and a medication review. Participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to either the MAS group or a usual care group. Participants in the MAS group will&#xD;
      use the computerized MAS program and answer questions about their medication regimens.&#xD;
      Reports will then be generated for both the participants and their doctors. Participants will&#xD;
      meet with their doctors to review the reports and discuss their medications and CVD risks.&#xD;
      Participants in the usual care group will receive written materials on CVD risk factors, and&#xD;
      they will receive usual care from their doctors. At a 6-month visit, participants in the MAS&#xD;
      group will undergo a medication review, blood pressure measurements, and interviews with&#xD;
      study staff. They will also enter their medication information into the MAS and meet with&#xD;
      their doctors to discuss the generated report. Participants in the usual care group will not&#xD;
      take part in any study procedures at 6 months. At a 12-month visit, all participants will&#xD;
      undergo blood pressure measurements, a blood collection, and a medication review.&#xD;
      Participants in the MAS group will also complete questionnaires to assess the usefulness of&#xD;
      the MAS computer program.&#xD;
