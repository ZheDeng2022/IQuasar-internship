      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To carry out a prospective randomised controlled clinical trial to compare the efficacy of&#xD;
      vibration in reducing the pain of local anaesthetic injections into the upper eyelid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vibration of the adjacent soft tissue reduces the pain of anaesthetic injections in upper&#xD;
      eyelid surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In many surgical procedures performed under local anaesthetic, the most frightening and&#xD;
      painful aspect of the procedure for patients is the anaesthetic injection, and various&#xD;
      techniques have been advocated to address this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explaining to the patient beforehand what to expect, talking during the injection and&#xD;
      hand-holding can be helpful in relaxing and distracting some patients; however, this alone is&#xD;
      unlikely to be sufficient to relieve the pain of the injection in most cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simple measures that reduce the pain of anaesthetic injection and are widely practised&#xD;
      include administering the injection slowly and using a fine-bore needle (30 Gauge). Other&#xD;
      techniques that have been shown to be effective include warming or buffering the local&#xD;
      anaesthetic [1-6]. The use of 0.9% bacteriostatic saline solution in conjunction with&#xD;
      lidocaine has been demonstrated to significantly reduce patients' perceived pain during the&#xD;
      injection and operative procedure in eyelid surgery [7].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cooling the skin immediately prior to treatment has been shown to reduce the pain of&#xD;
      dermatological laser procedures [8-10] although this might be difficult to perform around the&#xD;
      eyes because of the risk of injuring the cornea. Similarly, topical anaesthetic agents, such&#xD;
      as EMLA (eutectic mixture of local anaesthetics) cream, which are applied to the skin one&#xD;
      hour prior to injection are commonly employed for use on the limbs of infants and children&#xD;
      but are not safe for use around the eyes since inadvertent ocular application causes corneal&#xD;
      de-epithelisation [11].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sedative agents, such as midazolam may be useful in anxious patients, but this requires the&#xD;
      input of an anaesthetist and it is often difficult to finely control the level of sedation;&#xD;
      it is usually preferable not to have patients sedated during eyelid surgery when patient&#xD;
      cooperation is required intra-operatively to assess the height of the eyelids, for example in&#xD;
      ptosis surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vibration, pinching or the application of pressure has long been recognised as a method of&#xD;
      reducing concurrent pain. In 1965 Melzack and Wall published their gate control theory of&#xD;
      pain in which they asserted that the stimulation of vibration or touch receptors in the skin&#xD;
      causes stimulation of inhibitory interneurons in the spinal cord which can in turn inhibit&#xD;
      the transmission of pain signals to the brain.[12] Other hypotheses to explain the mechanism&#xD;
      of action of hyper-stimulatory anaesthesia relate to an acupuncture-type effect, distraction,&#xD;
      self-hypnosis or suggestion in credulous patients, but the consensus view is that the gate&#xD;
      theory is at least in part relevant in the explanation. [13, 14] There is much anecdotal&#xD;
      evidence of the use of such techniques to reduce the pain of anaesthetic injection, mostly in&#xD;
      dentistry and dermatology [14-17] but there is a dearth of evidence from randomised&#xD;
      controlled trials; a recent randomised clinical study in paediatric dental patients found&#xD;
      that counterstimulation, using the thumb to vibrate the soft tissue adjacent to the injection&#xD;
      site, in conjunction with a distraction exercise (lifting alternate legs in turn) effectively&#xD;
      reduced the pain of anaesthetic injection. [18] There are no reports of vibration anaesthesia&#xD;
      in an ophthalmic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to carry out a randomised controlled study to investigate the effect&#xD;
      of vibration-assisted anaesthesia in reducing the pain of local anaesthetic injection for&#xD;
      upper eyelid surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot study carried out prior to this proposal investigated the feasibility and potential&#xD;
      benefits of this trial with very promising results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the pilot study various different vibrating devices (including tuning forks of two&#xD;
      different frequencies, an electric toothbrush (with a soft rubber cap instead of a brush&#xD;
      head) and several models of handheld massagers) were trialled by the investigators on&#xD;
      themselves and colleagues to find the optimal device. Once the preferred instrument (a&#xD;
      handheld massager) was selected it was tested on various different sites (including midbrow,&#xD;
      mid forehead, over the supraorbital notch, lower eyelid, thumbnail and palm) by&#xD;
      verbally-consenting patients undergoing bilateral eyelid surgery in order to find the optimal&#xD;
      site. The patients received the massager during injection on one side but not the other (some&#xD;
      first eye, some second eye) and were asked to verbally rate the pain scores of the two sides.&#xD;
      The consensus opinion was that the greatest effect was produced by vibration in the middle of&#xD;
      the forehead.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot study was then conducted on 15 verbally consenting patients undergoing bilateral&#xD;
      upper eyelid surgery; during the anaesthetic injection on one side they received vibration&#xD;
      and the other side received no vibration. Patients were asked to rate the pain of both&#xD;
      injections verbally on a scale of 0 to 10. 12 out of 15 patients found the anaesthetic&#xD;
      injection on the side with vibration to be less painful than the side without.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a prospective, interventional, randomised, controlled clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who fit the inclusion criteria will be offered participation in the trial on the&#xD;
      day their surgery is booked. They will be given an information leaflet about the trial,&#xD;
      explaining the aim of the study without describing the effect of the vibrating device and&#xD;
      placebo in order to reduce the risk of biasing their perception. They will be advised that&#xD;
      non-participation will not affect their care in anyway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is of no risk to the patient and will not affect the surgical procedure in&#xD;
      any way. Any questions that the patient has will be addressed beforehand and they will be&#xD;
      required to sign a consent form prior to inclusion in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be advised beforehand that they will be required to verbally rate their pain score&#xD;
      on a scale of 0 to 10 immediately after both sides have been anaesthetised, with 0 being no&#xD;
      pain and 10 being the worst imaginable pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants included in the study will undergo bilateral surgery and will therefore act&#xD;
      as their own controls: the vibrating device will only be applied whilst the anaesthetic is&#xD;
      being injected into one side; a placebo will be applied to the other side. The placebo&#xD;
      consists of a switched-off vibrating device applied to the test site and a second identical&#xD;
      switched-on vibrating device held close (but not touching) the first, which will therefore&#xD;
      make the same sound. Care will be taken to ensure that the devices are out of the&#xD;
      participants' view. The test and placebo will be randomly assigned to either the first or&#xD;
      second eyelid; the right eyelid will be injected first in all patients, as is our routine&#xD;
      practice. Computer-generated sequential binary randomisation will be used. Allocation will be&#xD;
      concealed from the surgeon until immediately prior to the anaesthetic injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All anaesthetic injections will consist of xylocaine 1% with 1:100,000 adrenaline and will be&#xD;
      administered through a short 30 Gauge needle at a constant slow speed at multiple (6-7) sites&#xD;
      along the upper lid by a single oculoplastic consultant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vibration device and placebo will be operated by a single oculoplastics fellow. The&#xD;
      vibrating device / placebo will be placed on the middle of the forehead 1 cm above the&#xD;
      mid-brow point 1 second before the anaesthetic injection is commenced. It will be lifted off&#xD;
      the skin every time the injection needle exits the skin and it will be replaced on the same&#xD;
      point 1 second before the needle reenters the skin at a new injection site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' verbal pain scores will be elicited and documented immediately by the oculoplastic&#xD;
      fellow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a pilot study which involved asking 15 patients undergoing upper eyelid surgery to rate&#xD;
      the pain they experienced on injection of the local anaesthetic on a scale of 0 to 10, we&#xD;
      found pain scores to be sufficiently Normal for an estimation of the sample size to be based&#xD;
      on a Normal distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comparison of the pain scores between the side receiving vibration and the side receiving&#xD;
      placebo will be made using the paired t-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned sample size On a scale of 0 to 10 a difference in pain score of 1.5 may be considered&#xD;
      to be clinically significant. The power calculation for a paired t-test with 90% power and&#xD;
      p=0.05 demonstrated that a sample size of 80 patients to be more than sufficient to detect a&#xD;
      significant difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed ophthalmological journal and&#xD;
      presentation at international ophthalmological meetings.&#xD;
