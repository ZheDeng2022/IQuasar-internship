  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traditional modes of ventilation have failed to improve patient survival. Subsequent&#xD;
      observations that elevated airway pressures observed in traditional forms of ventilation&#xD;
      resulted in barotrauma and extension of ALI lead to the evolution of low volume cycled&#xD;
      ventilation as a potentially better ventilatory modality for ARDS. Recent multicenter trials&#xD;
      by the NIH-ARDS network have confirmed that low volume ventilation increases the number of&#xD;
      ventilatory free days and improves overall patient survival. While reducing mean airway&#xD;
      pressure has reduced barotrauma and improved patient survival, it has impaired attempts to&#xD;
      improve alveolar recruitment. Alveolar recruitment is important as it improves V/Q mismatch,&#xD;
      allows reduction in FIO2 earlier, and decreases the risk of oxygen toxicity. Airway pressure&#xD;
      release ventilation (APRV) is a novel ventilatory modality that utilizes controlled positive&#xD;
      airway pressure to maximize alveolar recruitment while minimizing barotrauma. In APRV, tidal&#xD;
      ventilation occurs between the increase in lung volumes established by the application of&#xD;
      CPAP and the relaxation of lung tissue following pressure release. Preliminary studies have&#xD;
      suggested that APRV recruits collapsed alveoli and improves oxygenation through a restoration&#xD;
      of pulmonary mechanics, but there are no studies indicating the potential overall benefit of&#xD;
      APRV in recovery form ALI/ADRS.&#xD;
