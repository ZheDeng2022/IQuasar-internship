  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to investigate the clinical safety, tolerability and efficacy of&#xD;
      prucalopride in improving the symptoms associated with chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction&#xD;
      (CIP) in subjects with CIP. The study hypothesis was that prucalopride at doses up to 4 mg is&#xD;
      safe, well tolerated, efficacious and improves the symptoms associated with CIP.&#xD;

      This phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-treatment four periods cross-over trial&#xD;
      investigated the clinical safety, tolerability and the efficacy of R093877 (prucalopride) in&#xD;
      improving the symptoms associated with chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIP) in&#xD;
      subjects with CIP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were treated for 4 periods of 12 weeks each with either R093877 2 mg (2 periods) or&#xD;
      placebo (2 periods). In each of the first and second 6 month period, there was a placebo&#xD;
      (PLA) and an active drug (PRU) treatment period. There were no wash-out periods. In total,7&#xD;
      subjects were randomized; 2 were assigned to the PLA-PRU-PLA-PRU, 2 to the PRUPLA-PRU-PLA, 2&#xD;
      to the PLA-PRU-PRU-PLA, and 1 to the PRU-PLA-PLA-PRU sequence group. Subjects were allowed to&#xD;
      use up to 4 mg of prucalopride per day if the 2 mg dose seemed to be insufficient. Two&#xD;
      subjects used an average of 3 mg of prucalopride per day during the active drug periods.&#xD;
