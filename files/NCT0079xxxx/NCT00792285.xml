  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This large randomized controlled trial is testing the effectiveness of automated telephone&#xD;
      outreach with speech recognition to improve rates of screening for colorectal cancer. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that the intervention improves rates of screening overall and specifically&#xD;
      rates of colonoscopy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United&#xD;
      States. Despite widespread dissemination of evidence-based guidelines recommending CRC&#xD;
      screening, a large proportion of eligible individuals do not undergo screening. A variety of&#xD;
      interventions have been tested to increase screening in primary care, but there remains an&#xD;
      urgent imperative to develop and evaluate cost-effective and widely applicable approaches to&#xD;
      promoting screening. In March 2005, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, a large non-profit HMO in&#xD;
      New England, carried out an internally funded program to increase CRC screening. The HMO&#xD;
      randomized 80,000 members aged 50 to 64 years to receive automated telephone outreach with&#xD;
      speech recognition or usual care. The intervention entailed the telephone engagement of&#xD;
      members in a dialogue with a computer-programmed, responsive human voice about the importance&#xD;
      of CRC screening, the options for undergoing screening, and encouragement to follow-up with&#xD;
      their primary care physicians. The present study involves a 12-month follow-up of all&#xD;
      eligible members randomized to intervention or usual care in March 2005, with assessment of&#xD;
      the effect of the intervention on rates of CRC screening. This study has important&#xD;
      implications for increasing CRC screening. With health plans expanding efforts to screen&#xD;
      large populations for CRC and other malignancies, automated telephone outreach with speech&#xD;
      recognition can reach large numbers of individuals with educational and reminder messages. It&#xD;
      is important to know whether these efforts to promote screening are effective in overcoming&#xD;
      known disparities in screening for CRC. If proven effective and cost-effective, this&#xD;
      technology has the potential for widespread adoption and population-wide improvements in CRC&#xD;
      screening and other prevention-related behaviors, with the ultimate public health goal of&#xD;
      reducing the burden of suffering attributable to cancer and its complications.&#xD;
