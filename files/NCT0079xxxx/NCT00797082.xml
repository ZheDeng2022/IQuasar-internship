      The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy of cardiac MRI to detect coronary disease in&#xD;
      diabetic patients. Cardiac MRI will be compared to myocardial scintigraphy with is the method&#xD;
      being used in current practice. The investigators believe that cardiac MRI will be as&#xD;
      efficient if not better that myocardial scintigraphy to detect tight coronary artery stenosis&#xD;
      with the advantage of providing no radiation to the patient. Moreover, the investigators&#xD;
      believe that cardiac MR will add additional information regarding possible undetected&#xD;
      myocardial infarction.&#xD;

      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of diabetes is rising constantly. According to the WHO projections, the&#xD;
      population of diabetics will double by 2025. In France, the current population of diabetics&#xD;
      is estimated at 2.5 millions persons. The cause of death in diabetics involves a&#xD;
      cardiovascular condition in approximately 65-80% of the cases. The leading event is&#xD;
      myocardial infarction. The prevalence of silent myocardial ischemia (SMI) in diabetics varies&#xD;
      widely from 10 to 30%. The prognosis of SMI is closely dependent on the presence or not of&#xD;
      angiographically significant coronary artery stenosis - CAS (patients with SMI and CAS&gt;70%&#xD;
      show 31% of major cardiac events at 41±24 months vs only 1.4% in patients with SMI and no&#xD;
      CAS&gt;70%). It seems therefore important to identify diabetic patients with SMI and CAS&#xD;
      especially knowing that endovascular or surgical treatments are available and can potentially&#xD;
      improve the prognosis of such patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myocardial Perfusion Scintigraphy (MPS) is widely prescribed to detect coronary stenosis. It&#xD;
      has a high sensitivity (90%) but an intermediate specificity (75%), providing a significant&#xD;
      amount of false positive cases. Such false positive cases are usually followed with&#xD;
      unnecessary coronary angiographies. Myocardial Perfusion Stress MRI (MRI) has been recently&#xD;
      developed and shows promising preliminary results (equivalent sensitivity, higher specificity&#xD;
      compared to MPS) for the identification of coronary artery stenosis. Few studies directly&#xD;
      compare MRI and MPS in the general population, none in the diabetic population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal objective: To evaluate and compare diagnostic performances of MRI and MPS for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of coronary insufficiency in diabetic patients free of known coronary disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cost efficacy analysis for the diagnosis of coronary insufficiency in diabetic patients&#xD;
           free of known coronary disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Impact of clinical information on MRI and MPS diagnostic performances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:. Prospective, monocentric study, where MRI and MPS will be assessed in a centralised&#xD;
      manner by 2 independent blinded readers (2 readers for each technique) and compared to&#xD;
      coronary angiography (Gold Standard, assessed by 2 independent blinded readers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient selection: Patient with diabetes (type 1 or type 2), free of known coronary disease,&#xD;
      addressed for MPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion period length: 24 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up period length: 2 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal judgement criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary angiography: positive diagnosis of CAS if stenosis &gt;50% on the left coronary artery&#xD;
      (trunk) or stenosis &gt;70% on the IVA (inter ventricular artery), LCx (circumflex artery) or&#xD;
      RCA (right coronary artery) and branches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MPS : positive diagnosis of CAS based on the following criteria : severity perfusion index,&#xD;
      reversibility, contractility anomalies, signal attenuation due to patient morphology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI : positive diagnosis of CAS based on an algorithm including the following criteria :&#xD;
      first pass perfusion defect at stress, reversibility at rest, Myocardial Delayed Enhancement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of necessary patients: 165&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: An assessment of MRI performances compared to MPS for the diagnosis of&#xD;
      coronary insufficiency in diabetic patients free of known coronary disease that will help&#xD;
      improve diagnostic strategy.&#xD;
