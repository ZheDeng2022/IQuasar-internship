  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with spinal cord injuries posses many factors that increase their risk of developing&#xD;
      pressure ulcers. Not surprisingly, approximately 82% of persons with spinal cord injury (SCI)&#xD;
      will experience a pressure ulcer at sometime during their life. Earlier guidelines for the&#xD;
      assessment and treatment of pressure ulcers produced by RNAO in 20027 recommended that &quot;a&#xD;
      client who has a pressure ulcer on a seating surface should avoid sitting.&quot; Unfortunately,&#xD;
      this recommendation has fueled the long standing view that people with pressure ulcers should&#xD;
      stop using their wheelchairs and return to bed. The strength of evidence assigned for this&#xD;
      recommendation was Level=C reflecting the paucity of research evidence to support this common&#xD;
      practice. Not only do the benefits of bed rest on healing remain to be demonstrated, there is&#xD;
      mounting evidence that bed rest can be harmful to a person's overall health and well being.&#xD;
      Bed rest has been shown to be strongly associated with complications in most body systems&#xD;
      including respiratory, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, cerebrovascular, gastrointestinal,&#xD;
      and genital-urinary. Psychosocial complications and cognitive impacts are also well&#xD;
      documented. Without evidence to dispel the myth that &quot;bed rest is best&quot; it will be difficult&#xD;
      to change practice and avoid many of the secondary complications. This study is a pilot study&#xD;
      to 1) determine whether pressure ulcers heal faster in individuals with SCI who receive an&#xD;
      individualized community-based, pressure management and mobility program compared to a&#xD;
      similar group assigned to usual care (bed rest), 2) determine the strength of the association&#xD;
      between the intervention (pressure/mobility or bedrest) and wound healing, motor&#xD;
      performance/independence and quality of life while adjusting for motivation to regain&#xD;
      independence, degree of caregiver burden, and compliance with the intervention, 3) determine&#xD;
      whether individuals with SCI who participate in a pressure/mobility management program&#xD;
      experience fewer secondary complications than those who do not participate, 4) determine the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of providing a time-efficient, pressure management and mobility program&#xD;
      compared to bed rest.&#xD;

      Hypothesis: Individuals with SCI who have pressure ulcers who receive an individualized,&#xD;
      community-based, pressure management and mobility program will have better outcomes compared&#xD;
      to a similar group of individuals who remain on bed rest (usual care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether pressure ulcers heal faster in individuals with SCI who receive an&#xD;
           individualized community-based, pressure management and mobility program compared to a&#xD;
           similar group assigned to usual care (bed rest).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the strength of the association between the intervention (pressure/mobility&#xD;
           or bedrest) and wound healing, motor performance/independence and quality of life while&#xD;
           adjusting for motivation to regain independence, degree of caregiver burden, and&#xD;
           compliance with the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine whether individuals with SCI who participate in a pressure/mobility&#xD;
           management program experience fewer secondary complications than those who do not&#xD;
           participate&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine the cost-effectiveness of providing a time-efficient, pressure management&#xD;
           and mobility program compared to bed rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To formally evaluate our ability to successfully recruit eligible patients into the full&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To determine the barriers and facilitators to successful implementation of a pressure&#xD;
           management and mobility program from the perspective of the client, caregiver, and&#xD;
           health care provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To use our experiences individualizing pressure management and mobility programs to&#xD;
           develop a preceptorship/mentorship training program for community-based&#xD;
           pressure/mobility management that can be transferred to other regions in Ontario through&#xD;
           distance education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This pilot study is a double-blind, parallel group, randomized controlled&#xD;
      cross-over design that will be conducted in two centres over a 1.5 year period. Rigorous&#xD;
      pilot data will ensure that our intervention has sufficient potential to warrant further&#xD;
      investigation, will determine whether our protocol is feasible. As such, the methods and data&#xD;
      collection strategies laid out in this protocol are meant to mimic the full trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample population We will enroll twenty individuals with SCI living in each of the two sites&#xD;
      (Toronto (n=10) and London (n=10)) who have a Stage II to IV pressure ulcer(s) and meet the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening assessment: A research assistant will contact volunteers who consent to participate&#xD;
      in the study and assess the subject's willingness to undergo a medical and wound assessment&#xD;
      to determine study eligibility. She/he will collect, information on SCI injury, demographics,&#xD;
      current level of activity, wheelchair use, and wound history. This will entail a phone&#xD;
      interview and home assessment and the research assistant will schedule the clinic visit to&#xD;
      assess eligibility. For subjects who are interested in learning more about the study, the&#xD;
      research assistant will schedule the clinic visit to assess eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wound Assessment: We will arrange transportation to the wound management centre where the&#xD;
      subject's eligibility for study participation (see Inclusion/Exclusion criteria) will be&#xD;
      determined. The subject's current medical status and pressure sore(s) will be assessed by&#xD;
      research personnel including a qualified wound care specialist and she/he will record&#xD;
      detailed wound history, determine wound extent and severity, and assess the likelihood that&#xD;
      the wound will heal over the 8 month study period. As part of this medical screen, a blood&#xD;
      sample will be drawn and wound swab will be obtained and analyzed for key determinants of&#xD;
      healing (metabolic disorders, anemia, nutritional deficiencies, infection). From this&#xD;
      assessment, we will develop a treatment plan to optimize wound environment, provide&#xD;
      nutritional supplementation, and modify factors interfering with healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assignment of subjects to study groups: Following wound assessment, we will randomize ten&#xD;
      eligible subjects from each study centre (London and Toronto) who meet eligibility criteria&#xD;
      using the Zelen method whereby randomization to treatment group occurs prior to subject&#xD;
      consent for participation. Those subjects allocated to intervention group will be asked to&#xD;
      consent to participation in a randomized trial comparing usual care to a pressure management&#xD;
      and mobility program. They will be informed that they have been randomized to receive the&#xD;
      pressure management and mobility program. Those subjects allocated to usual care will be&#xD;
      asked to consent to participate in a long-term prospective natural history study to document&#xD;
      the effects of bed rest in individuals who have SCI and pressure wounds. This method of&#xD;
      randomization reduces the considerable risk of producing a biased estimate of the effect of&#xD;
      treatment since patients assigned to usual care are likely to feel that other study&#xD;
      participants are receiving better care (despite the lack of evidence to support this notion).&#xD;
      This method of blinding the patient is especially important in trials with subjective and&#xD;
      self-report outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using data obtained from the assessment at the wound centre, the randomization scheme will be&#xD;
      stratified according to two key determinants of healing; wound severity (Stage of pressure&#xD;
      ulcer II, III, IV); 2) and the presence or absence of 2 or more abnormal blood values to&#xD;
      ensure that the potential confounding affect on wound healing is equally dispersed between&#xD;
      treatment groups. Randomization will take place using the 24-hour web-based randomization&#xD;
      system at the Fowler Kennedy Methods Centre. The computer will provide the caller with a&#xD;
      group allocation to usual care or to the pressure management and mobility program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Usual Care: Subjects who are randomized to usual care will be encouraged to&#xD;
      implement the standard wound care protocol that is consistent with the National (CAWC)and&#xD;
      Provincial (RNAO) best practice guidelines for the treatment of pressures ulcers. This wound&#xD;
      care program will be customized to subject's needs based on the results of the assessment&#xD;
      performed by the wound care specialist. It will address medical, psychological, and&#xD;
      nutritional factors interfering with wound healing and optimize the wound environment. A&#xD;
      registered dietitian will review blood values associated with nutritional status and make&#xD;
      recommendations for dietary changes. Wherever possible, implementation of this wound care&#xD;
      program will be coordinated with the subjects' current health care team and appropriate&#xD;
      referrals to home care agencies or specialists will be initiated where needed. Subjects&#xD;
      assigned to this group will continue their current level of activity (bed rest). For the&#xD;
      purpose of this study we have defined bed rest as a significant reduction in patient's normal&#xD;
      activity level that involves more than 12 hours per day in bed. Any equipment or services&#xD;
      will be obtained through the usual provider agencies and documented as part of the associated&#xD;
      wait times. All study subjects who volunteer to participate in this screening process will&#xD;
      receive a written report that summarizes the findings of these assessments. Included in this&#xD;
      report will be an explanation of factors that interfere with healing and recommendations of&#xD;
      how to modify home or wound environment to promote wound closure and limit current and future&#xD;
      problems with skin integrity. Provided the study subject is in agreement, we will relay this&#xD;
      information to health care professionals and administrators involved in the subject's circle&#xD;
      of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Individualized, Community-based, Pressure management and Mobility program: Subjects&#xD;
      allocated to this group will be provided with the same customized wound care program as the&#xD;
      usual care group and a pressure management and mobility program that is customized to the&#xD;
      individual's needs. This program will be based on an in depth home environmental&#xD;
      assessment(s) performed by a registered Occupational (OT) and/or Physical Therapist (PT)&#xD;
      trained as part of the research study and will be implemented within one month of&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pressure Management program: A qualified OT or PT will examine the subject on all in-use&#xD;
      surfaces including bed, toilet/commode, and shower chair, conduct a detailed wheelchair&#xD;
      assessment including pressure mapping technology (X3 Pressure Mapping System, (Xsensor&#xD;
      Technology Corporation, Calgary, Canada) and observe all transfers on and off all surfaces to&#xD;
      identify sources of friction and shear, and any strength or balance deficits. The subject&#xD;
      will be asked to record their activity level by completing a diary to record daily activities&#xD;
      over a three day period including all surfaces used, duration on each surface and the number&#xD;
      and type of transfers completed throughout the day. From this detailed 1-2 hour home&#xD;
      assessment, the OT/PT apprentice will identify what equipment and services are required to&#xD;
      manage pressure, improve mobility, and reduce friction and shear. Through collaboration with&#xD;
      sponsoring company's (Waverly Glen, Shoppers Home Health, and The Roho Group). This program&#xD;
      might include rental or purchase and installation of necessary equipment or supplies,&#xD;
      modification of existing equipment, and follow up to provide required re-adjustments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mobility Program: We will contract services of a qualified Physical Therapist to assess&#xD;
      strength, balance, range of motion, and functional independence with transfers and other&#xD;
      ADLs. The subject will be asked to perform activities to classify their current level of&#xD;
      functional independence using the FIM motor scale (FIM). Based on the results of this&#xD;
      assessment she/he will develop a mobility program to optimize functional independence and&#xD;
      improve strength and balance required for safe and effective transfers and bed mobility&#xD;
      including educating the individual and their caregivers how to move with minimal injury to&#xD;
      their skin. Depending on the complexity of the mobility program, delivery of this customized&#xD;
      mobility program may involve training of the existing, community-based Personal Support&#xD;
      Workers (PSW)s or other aids to assist with transfers, supervise strengthening and balance&#xD;
      exercises on a regular basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training of &quot;OT/PT Apprentices&quot; using Distance education methods: technologies A distance&#xD;
      education model will be used to build knowledge, skills and behaviours about pressure&#xD;
      management and rehabilitation of motor function that is needed in community based therapists&#xD;
      - called &quot;OT/PT Apprentices&quot;. Two therapists (OT and PT) per site will be selected and&#xD;
      trained to implement an individualized pressure management program for people with SCI who&#xD;
      are living in the community. They will first attend a 2 day workshop provided by L Norton and&#xD;
      P Houghton. Information learned in this session will be reinforced using a&#xD;
      preceptorship/mentorship model together with hands-on experience with subjects enrolled in&#xD;
      the research study. This will begin with joint home visits with Norton and/or Houghton who&#xD;
      will directly supervise their assessments. Subsequently, the OT/PT apprentices will perform&#xD;
      home assessments independently and relay their findings (pressure map, room dimensions, video&#xD;
      clips of subject transfers) electronically. Norton and Houghton will also be available by&#xD;
      mobile phone should any questions arise during the assessments. Computer based distance&#xD;
      learning technology (WebCT) will be used to access key articles &amp; resources, and participate&#xD;
      in asynchronous and synchronous discussion groups between instructors (Houghton &amp; Norton) and&#xD;
      Apprentices (n=4 OT or PTs). This form of eductation is know to will help foster clinical&#xD;
      reasoning skills22-24 needed to problem solve many of the roadblocks that are anticipated&#xD;
      with program implementation. This education program will be modified and improved throughout&#xD;
      the study in accordance with therapist feedback and needs as identified and will inform our&#xD;
      sixth and seventh objective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data &amp; Statistical Analysis Primary Objective 1 - Wound Healing: We will calculate the&#xD;
      percentage reduction in wound surface area for each subject by subtracting the initial wound&#xD;
      surface area from the surface area measured at the primary endpoint - 5 months post&#xD;
      randomization -following 3 months of the pressure management and mobility program&#xD;
      (intervention group) or bed rest (usual care group). We will calculate the mean percentage&#xD;
      reduction in wound surface by treatment group and determine whether the difference between&#xD;
      groups is statistically significant using a t-test. Further, we will use an analysis of&#xD;
      co-variance (where baseline wound surface area is entered as the covariate, wound surface&#xD;
      area at 5 months is the dependent variable and treatment group is the independent variable)&#xD;
      to determine whether there is statistically significant difference in the healing of pressure&#xD;
      ulcers in individuals who receive the pressure management and mobility program compared to a&#xD;
      similar group on bed rest, while controlling for the baseline surface area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2 - Motor Function and Quality of Life: Similar to the analysis described above, we&#xD;
      will use an analysis of co-variance (where the baseline measurement is entered as the&#xD;
      covariate, the post-randomization (5 months) measure is the dependent variable and treatment&#xD;
      group is the independent variable) to determine whether there is statistically significant&#xD;
      difference in the quality of life (SF-12, Cardiff Wound Impact Questionnaire) in individuals&#xD;
      who receive the pressure management and mobility program compared to a similar group on bed&#xD;
      rest, while controlling for the baseline score. We will produce a plot to express the change&#xD;
      in quality of life and function by time and assess whether the trajectory of change is&#xD;
      different by group using a repeated measures analysis of covariance. As this is a pilot&#xD;
      study, we expect to be underpowered to make statistical conclusions regarding the size of the&#xD;
      treatment effect with confidence. However, if an important between-groups difference (20% of&#xD;
      the minimally important difference (MID)) is contained within the 95% confidence intervals&#xD;
      around the mean difference between groups, we will conclude that a larger study is warranted.&#xD;
      We will provide the proportion of individuals in each group who achieve their goals as laid&#xD;
      out in the COPM at baseline, calculate the odds of obtaining desired goals in the pressure&#xD;
      management/mobility program compared to usual care and assess whether the difference in&#xD;
      proportions is significant using a Fisher's Exact Test. As this is a pilot study, the study&#xD;
      will be underpowered to confidently examine the strength of the association between&#xD;
      motivation, caregiver burden and compliance on between-group differences. Thus, we will&#xD;
      conduct an exploratory analysis using univariate regression methods to provide a preliminary&#xD;
      estimate of the magnitude of the association so that we can formulate informed a priori&#xD;
      hypotheses about the relationships between outcomes and multiple potential predictor&#xD;
      variables that we will have sufficient power to test formally as part of the full study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3 - Secondary Complications We will report the proportion of patients who&#xD;
      experience adverse events by group. Adverse events will be considered any of those conditions&#xD;
      known to commonly occur with bed rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 4 - Cost Effectiveness: We will conduct an economic analysis to compare usual care&#xD;
      with a pressure management/mobility program in terms of incremental cost per quality-adjusted&#xD;
      life-year (QALY) gained from the Ministry of Health and societal perspective. The time&#xD;
      horizon of the economic evaluation will be 8 months. To determine the 8 month direct and&#xD;
      indirect costs associated with each alternative, resource utilization, productivity losses,&#xD;
      informal care and out of pocket expenditures collected at baseline and at months 2, 5, and 8&#xD;
      will be valued using public and private sources (e.g. Ontario Schedule of Benefits for&#xD;
      Physician Services, manufacturers). In order to calculate QALYs, utilities derived from the&#xD;
      EQ-5D questionnaire will be weighted by time spent in health states. Regression analyses will&#xD;
      be used in calculating QALYs to adjust for any potential differences in baseline utility&#xD;
      values between the 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 5 Subject Recruitment: To inform our fifth objective, we will report the number of&#xD;
      eligible patients from each source and calculate the proportion of eligible patients who are&#xD;
      willing to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives 6 and 7 Experiences: We will review diaries of subjects, caregivers, and&#xD;
      therapists to optimize and streamline delivery of this program. Utilization of the methods&#xD;
      centre as a remote, web-based, data management system will be informed by feedback from&#xD;
      research personnel. The distance education program will be modified and improved throughout&#xD;
      the study in accordance with &quot;OT/PT apprentices&quot; suggestions and needs.&#xD;
