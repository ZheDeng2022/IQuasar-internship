    <textblock>
      The studied materials contains surgically specimens of two groups of patiens with non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer who have received two regimens of induction (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy&#xD;
      before tumor resection. Pathological specimens of pre-chemotherapy and post-chemotherapy&#xD;
      whatever retrievable will be collected. The protein ad RNA expression of DNA repair genes&#xD;
      (ERCC1, ERCC2, XRCC1, XRCC3, BRCA1 and RRM1) as well as DNA polymorphisms of these genes will&#xD;
      be studied, and will be correlate with the treatment response and outcome of the patients.&#xD;
      The aims of this study include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To identify the expression status of the above DNA repair genes in Taiwanese NSCLC&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To correlate the expression, as well as DNA polymorphism of each DNA repair gene in&#xD;
           treatment response to two differenct chemotherapeutic regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To correlate the expression, as well as DNA polymorphism of each DNA repair gene in the&#xD;
           outcome of stage III NSCLC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To explore whether platinum based chemotherapy will change the expression status of DNA&#xD;
           repair gene and if indeed changed, whether this would influence the outcome of the&#xD;
           patients&#xD;

      Patients with clinical stage IIIA N2 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have a 5-year&#xD;
      survival rate of 10% to 15%, much worse than those of earlier stages of disease. The use of&#xD;
      pre-operative (neo-adjuvant) chemotherapy has been shown to be beneficial in several&#xD;
      studies.1 However, the precise chemotherapeutic regimen for neoadjuvant therapy remains an&#xD;
      open question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment response and toxicity of chemotherapy vary widely among and within individuals,&#xD;
      and races. Recently, molecular predictive markers may help to identify who may benefit from&#xD;
      individual therapy. Many evidence shows that the level of ERCC1 (an excision nuclease within&#xD;
      the nucleotide excision repair pathway) is important for the repair of platinum-DNA adducts&#xD;
      and the response to platinum-based chemotherapy.2-5 Not only by measuring protein and mRNA&#xD;
      expression, studies addressed on the polymorphism of ERCC1(118 C/T and C8092A) had&#xD;
      demonstrated impact on survival of chemotherapy-treated NSCLC patients6,7. XPD/ERCC2&#xD;
      (xeroderma pigmentosum group D/excision repair cross-complementing group 2) 8, XRCC1 (X-ray&#xD;
      repair cross-complementing group 1) and XRCC3 (X-ray repair cross-complementing group 3) are&#xD;
      another three proteins involving NER, serving as prognostic factor of survival.9 BRCA1 is a&#xD;
      protein participating in recombinant repair (RR) and is stronge predictive marker of&#xD;
      chemotherapy response. BRCA1 functions as a differential modulator of survival with cisplatin&#xD;
      and antimicrotubule drugs (paclitaxel, docetaxel and vinorelbine). Low level of BRCA1 enhance&#xD;
      cisplatin activity but lead to resistance to paclitaxel, docetaxel and vinorelbine, whereas&#xD;
      the opposite phenomenon is observed in the presence of normal or high levels of BRCA1. In&#xD;
      contract, BRCA1 levels do not influence the effect of gemcitabine10. On the contrary, RRM1&#xD;
      (ribonucleotid reductase subunit M1) is involved in gemcitabine metabolism and DNA repair&#xD;
      after chemotherapy damage, and increased RRM1 mRNA expression has been related to gemcitabine&#xD;
      resistance in NSCLC11. All these DNA repair genes participate the pathogenesis, mechanism of&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic resistance and outcome of lung cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously, a joint study done by NTUH and VGH Taipei used gemcitabine and cisplatin as&#xD;
      induction chemotherapy to treat 52 patient with stage III NSCLC, 36 were operable and 18 were&#xD;
      completely resected.12 From 2004 till now, a prospective study has been performed in NTUH&#xD;
      using docetaxel and cisplatin as neoadjuvant regimen to treat patients with stage IIIA (N2)&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer. Up to now, more than 40 patients were enrolled, all of them have&#xD;
      received tumor sampling before chemotherapy and more 90% received operation with their tumor&#xD;
      resected. The tissue specimens are valuable as all these patients had received protocolized&#xD;
      treatment, with filed detailed clinical information collected systematically. All the&#xD;
      peroperative biopsied and operatively resected tumor tissues are available in paffin-embedded&#xD;
      block, some in frozen tissue stock, we plan to study the DNA polymorphism, protein and RNA&#xD;
      expression of the above-mentioned DNA repair genes in these two series of patients.&#xD;
