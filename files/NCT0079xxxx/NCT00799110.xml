    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating the effect (good and bad) of a dendritic cell/tumor fusion&#xD;
      vaccine in combination with the laboratory made agents GM-CSF and imiquimod on the&#xD;
      participants immune system. Another purpose of this study is to determine the type and&#xD;
      severity of any side effects associated with this new study vaccine. We will also be&#xD;
      evaluating what effect the vaccine has on the participants cancer. Dendritic cell vaccines&#xD;
      have already been tested in clinical trials involving participants with many different types&#xD;
      of cancer. Dendritic cells are powerful immune-stimulating cells that are normally found in&#xD;
      small amounts in the body and are responsible for immune responses against &quot;foreign&quot;&#xD;
      substances that enter the body.&#xD;

      -  Patients must have undergone therapeutic debulking surgery for independent clinical&#xD;
           indications and have tissue frozen and stored under sterile conditions as part of&#xD;
           protocol 07-319 (Study of Primary Tumor Harvest for the Purpose of Possible Use in a&#xD;
           Future Clinical Trial in Patients with Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal&#xD;
           Cancer)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be assigned to one of two study groups. Both groups will undergo a&#xD;
           procedure known as leukapheresis by which the white blood cells are removed from the&#xD;
           participants blood in order to obtain the dendritic cells. Prior to this procedure&#xD;
           participants may receive 4 injections of GM-CSF, which helps increase the white blood&#xD;
           cell count.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If enough cells are obtained during the leukapheresis, tumor cells and dendritic cells&#xD;
           will then be fused (mixed) together in the laboratory and divided into the appropriate&#xD;
           doses for administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants assigned to Group 1 will undergo subcutaneous vaccination with the&#xD;
           dendritic cell tumor fusion vaccine. On the day of the vaccine and three days&#xD;
           afterwards, they will receive GM-CSF injections at the site of the vaccination.&#xD;
           Participants will receive a dose of the vaccine every 3 weeks for a total of 3&#xD;
           vaccinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants assigned to Group 2 will undergo subcutaneous vaccination with the&#xD;
           dendritic cell tumor fusion vaccine. On the day of the vaccine and three days&#xD;
           afterwards, they will receive GM-CSF injection at the site of the vaccination.&#xD;
           Additionally, imiquimod cream will be applied to the skin at the injection sight 2 hours&#xD;
           before the vaccine administration. Participants will continue to apply imiquimod cream&#xD;
           at the site of vaccination for 3 days following the injection. Participants will receive&#xD;
           a dose of the vaccine every 3 weeks for a total of 3 vaccinations.&#xD;
