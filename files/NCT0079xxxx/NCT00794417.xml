  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to determine whether the combination of aflibercept, pemetrexed&#xD;
      and cisplatin is safe and effective in treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was conducted in two phases. In phase 1, patients with advanced cancer received&#xD;
      different doses of aflibercept in combination with approved doses of pemetrexed and&#xD;
      cisplatin. The objective of phase 1 was to determine the safest dose of the combined study&#xD;
      medications. This dose was administered to patients with previously untreated NSCLC in phase&#xD;
      2. The phase 2 portion of the study determined if the combination is effective in treating&#xD;
      NSCLC.&#xD;

    <measure>Phase 1: Recommended Dose of Aflibercept for Phase 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Phase 1: Baseline up to 315 Days</time_frame>
    <description>Recommended Dose was defined as the highest combination dose at which fewer than 33 percent (%) of participants experienced dose limiting toxicity during the first cycle of therapy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase 2: Objective Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Phase 2: Baseline (Day 421) up to end of study (Day 972)</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response rate was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions and PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking the Baseline sum LD as reference.</description>

    <measure>Phase 2: Progression-free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Phase 2: Baseline (Day 421) up to end of study (Day 972)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time in days from the date of first study drug administration to the date of first documentation of tumor progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, as assessed by the modified RECIST. Median time of PFS was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase 1 and 2: Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Phase 1: Baseline up to 751 Days; Phase 2: Baseline (Day 421) up to 972 Days</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (for example, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug. Any TEAE included participants with both serious and non-serious AEs.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (for example, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug. Any TEAE included participants with both serious and non-serious AEs.</description>
