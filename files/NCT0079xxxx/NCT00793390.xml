      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare, poorly understood and particularly&#xD;
           aggressive form of breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three characteristics of IBC tumors their rapid progression, their extensive formation&#xD;
           of new blood vessels, and the fact that these characteristics are present from the&#xD;
           inception of the tumor make it an ideal model for studying factors associated with tumor&#xD;
           aggressiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study is a collaboration among several institutions in the United States and North&#xD;
           Africa that have extensive epidemiological experience and experience with IBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To understand what causes certain types of breast conditions, including IBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Women 18 years of age and older with IBC and non-IBC and healthy women volunteers are&#xD;
      eligible. Women who have had a previous diagnosis of any kind of breast cancer are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants complete a questionnaire providing information about their background,&#xD;
           including medical and reproductive history, family health history and lifestyle habits&#xD;
           and undergo the following additional procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Height, weight, hip and chest measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Saliva sample collection to measure biological factors that may be related to breast&#xD;
           conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breast examination and, if permission is given, photographs of affected breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis of biopsied tissue for genetic and biochemical factors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare, poorly understood and particularly aggressive&#xD;
      form of breast cancer characterized by diffuse erythema and edema/peau d orange of the&#xD;
      breast. The proposed case-control study of risk factors for IBC will include approximately&#xD;
      400 IBC cases accrued over a two-year period in centers in four countries in North Africa&#xD;
      (the major cancer center and selected private clinicians in Tunisia, the major cancer center&#xD;
      in Egypt, 2 cancer centers in Algeria, and 2 cancer centers in Morocco). Two control groups&#xD;
      will be included: 1) 400 non-IBC breast cancer cases and; 2) 400 visitor controls (excluding&#xD;
      those with breast, ovarian, endometrial, and nasopharyngeal cancers) in the study hospitals.&#xD;
      The study will involve the administration of a questionnaire, anthropometric measurements,&#xD;
      and saliva collection for all study subjects. In addition, digital photographs of the breasts&#xD;
      will be collected for IBC cases, and a clinical examination form and paraffin-embedded tumor&#xD;
      tissue will be collected for IBC cases and non-IOBC breast cancer controls. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted as a consortium, with form development and translation coordinated at the National&#xD;
      Cancer Institute (USA). A review of study procedures will be done after the first three&#xD;
      months of data collection. The National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Division of Cancer&#xD;
      Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), NCI-Office of International Affairs (OIA), University of&#xD;
      Michigan, and International Breast Cancer Research Foundation (IBCRF) will provide funding&#xD;
      for the project.&#xD;

        -  The case-control study will be restricted to women at least 18 years of age. IBC cases&#xD;
             will be defined as having any clinical signs of redness, and either edema or peau d'&#xD;
             orange characteristic of IBC or evidence of tumor emboli in the dermal lymphatics (at&#xD;
             the center in Rabat).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cases with extensive ulceration of the breast or with breast carcinoma 'en cuirasse' will&#xD;
        be excluded from the study, even if erythema is present.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women with a previous diagnosis of breast cancer will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All cancers will be pathologically confirmed with evidence of tumor in either the breast&#xD;
        parenchyma or dermal lymphatics based on the diagnostic biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cases newly diagnosed and/or treated at study hospitals will be included.&#xD;
