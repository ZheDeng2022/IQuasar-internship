  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to find out the highest dose per fraction of hypofractionated&#xD;
      Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (Hypo-IMRT) that can be safely given with temozolomide&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypo-IMRT is given in fewer treatments than conventional radiation therapy. This will be a&#xD;
      dose per fraction escalation study. A dose per fraction escalation study means that&#xD;
      successive groups of patients will receive higher doses per fraction of radiation while&#xD;
      keeping the total dose of radiation the same (60 Gy, Gy is a radiation unit). The radiation&#xD;
      dose per fraction will be increased and the numbers of radiation treatments will be decreased&#xD;
      until a fraction dose is reached at which there are unacceptable side effects compared with&#xD;
      possible benefit. Which group subjects are assigned to will depend on what stage the study&#xD;
      has reached at the time the subject decide to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is being done because with current standard radiation therapy (A total dose of&#xD;
      60 Gy given 2 Gy a day over 6 weeks) the outcome is very poor. New and more effective&#xD;
      radiation therapy methods are desperately needed for patients with GBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, radiation therapy is given together with chemotherapy of Temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is also designed to monitor the level of some of the known cytokines (specific&#xD;
      proteins in the blood) before and after radiation, and in meantime to screen unknown proteins&#xD;
      in patients' blood before and after radiation therapy. Hopefully, this will provide some&#xD;
      clues for future study of monitoring radiation damage, and possibly new therapeutic approach&#xD;
      for patients with GBM.&#xD;
