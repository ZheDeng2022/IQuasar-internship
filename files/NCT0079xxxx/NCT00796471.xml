    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of 2 extended-release (ER)&#xD;
      formulations of 2 mg-eq paliperidone in comparison to the 2 mg immediate-release (IR)&#xD;
      paliperidone oral solution and to evaluate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      these ER formulations. Additional objectives are to compare the pharmacodynamic effects&#xD;
      (postural changes in blood pressure and heart rate), safety, and tolerability are to be&#xD;
      evaluated in addition to exploring the relationship between CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5genotype and&#xD;
      paliperidone exposure.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a single-center, open-label, randomized, 5 treatment-period,&#xD;
      crossover study in healthy adults. The study consists of a screening phase and a treatment&#xD;
      phase during which each volunteer will receive 5 treatments of study drug in a random order&#xD;
      and separated by a washout period of at least 7 to 14 days. Treatments consist of a single&#xD;
      oral dose of: A) paliperidone ER pellet formulation, (2 mg-eq) as 1 capsule of 2.5 mg,&#xD;
      fasted; B) the same formulation as A but with food; C) paliperidone-coated ER OROS&#xD;
      formulation (2 mg eq) as 2 tablets of 2 mg, fasted; D) the same formulation as C but with&#xD;
      food; E) IR paliperidone oral solution, 2 mg (2 mL) of a 1 mg/mL solution, fasted.&#xD;
      Alternative paliperidone ER formulations are being developed with the aim to increase the&#xD;
      bioavailability without compromising the favorable effect on the orthostatic hypotension as&#xD;
      seen with ER OROS paliperidone. Therefore, in this study, the pharmacokinetic and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic properties, as well as the effect of food, of 2 alternative paliperidone ER&#xD;
      formulations using different mechanisms to achieve extended release of the drug will be&#xD;
      investigated: a multiparticulate ER capsule formulation, containing coated pellets comprised&#xD;
      of 3 coating layers, with both immediate and extended drug-release properties (pellet&#xD;
      formulation; drug ratio extended- versus immediate-release layer: 9:1), and an OROS trilayer&#xD;
      longitudinally compressed tablet formulation (Push-Pull delivery system) (overcoated-OROS&#xD;
      formulation). Safety and tolerability will be monitored throughout the study. Single doses of&#xD;
      paliperidone ER pellet formulation, (2 mg-eq) as 1 capsule of 2.5 mg, fasted; paliperidone ER&#xD;
      pellet formulation, (2 mg-eq) as 1 capsule of 2.5 mg with food (high-fat breakfast);&#xD;
      paliperidone-coated OROS ER formulation (2 mg-eq) as 2 tablets of 2 mg, fasted;&#xD;
      paliperidone-coated OROS ER formulation (2 mg-eq) as 2 tablets of 2 mg with food (high-fat&#xD;
      breakfast); IR paliperidone oral solution, 2 mg (2 mL) of a 1 mg/mL solution, fasted.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acceptable weight as defined by body mass index (weight [kg]/height (m)²) range of&#xD;
             18.0 to 28.0 kg/m², inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normotensive with supine (5 minutes) blood pressure between the range of 100 to 140&#xD;
             mmHg systolic, inclusive, and 60 to 90 mmHg diastolic, inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy on the basis of a prestudy physical examination, medical history,&#xD;
             electrocardiogram, and the laboratory results of blood biochemistry, hematology and&#xD;

             biochemistry, hematology or urinalysis testing are not within the laboratory's&#xD;
             reference ranges the volunteer can be included only if the investigator judges that&#xD;
             the deviations are not clinically significant. For liver function tests (alanine&#xD;
             transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and bilirubin), the values must be contained&#xD;
