    <textblock>
      Inflammation and fibrosis may be important contributors to worsening heart failure. As well&#xD;
      as lowering cholesterol, statins are also known to reduce inflammatory markers such as&#xD;
      C-reactive protein which are elevated in severe heart failure. Therefore, this project will&#xD;
      evaluate the benefit, if any, of statins on markers of heart structure and function, on&#xD;
      inflammatory markers and markers of fibrosis in patients with normal cholesterol.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Heart Failure (HF) remains a major public health problem. Despite significant advances in the&#xD;
      pharmacological management of this condition, the high mortality associated with heart&#xD;
      failure remains a concern with annual figures ranging from 10 - 15% in mildly symptomatic&#xD;
      patients to 50 - 60% in patients with severe heart failure.1&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major aetiological cause of HF is ischemic heart disease (IHD). While guidelines on the&#xD;
      treatment of IHD recommend the use of lipid lowering therapy with&#xD;
      hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) to improve prognosis, recent&#xD;
      surveys from the UK and have shown that these effective therapies are being under-utilised.2&#xD;
      The reasons appear to be multifactorial but include issues related to efficacy, safety,&#xD;
      potential for adverse drug reactions, failure to prescribe appropriate medication or dose and&#xD;
      noncompliance with therapy.3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some data from the large trials of statins are suggestive of benefit. In the 4S study 412&#xD;
      patients (9.2% of the study population) developed chronic heart failure requiring treatment,&#xD;
      i.e. 228 (10.3%) in the placebo group and 184 (8.3%) patients in the group treated with&#xD;
      simvastatin (p &lt; 0.015). However, several questions remain, not least how statins might be&#xD;
      beneficial in the setting of symptomatic heart failure.4 Treatment of heart failure has been&#xD;
      targeted to a certain extent at the cause - and in the case of the majority of heart failure&#xD;
      patients, the cause is related to ischemic heart disease and, perhaps, atherosclerosis.&#xD;
      Furthermore, it is believed that the non-lipid lowering effects of statins, including&#xD;
      neoangiogenesis, inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine activity, anti-fibrotic effects and&#xD;
      favorable modulation of the autonomic nervous system, could play a positive role in the&#xD;
      medical management of HF.5,6&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there are several specific concerns, which clinicians may have in relation to the&#xD;
      use of statins in heart failure. The average age of a community heart failure population is&#xD;
      generally above 70 years and observational data from Framingham have suggested an inverse&#xD;
      relationship between total cholesterol levels and all-cause mortality in older patients.5&#xD;
      There is an association between a total cholesterol level less than 5.2 mmol/L and impaired&#xD;
      one-year event free survival in a large group of patients with heart failure.6 Statins can&#xD;
      have a deleterious effect on myocardial function and thus have adverse effects on skeletal or&#xD;
      cardiac muscles due to the inhibition of the synthesis of mevalonate, a precursor of&#xD;
      ubiquinone.7&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elevated levels of markers such as C-reactive protein, TNF alpha and other inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines have been associated with poorer outcome in patients with HF, but excluding those&#xD;
      with clear sources of infection or other inflammatory disorder, elevated C-reactive protein&#xD;
      correlates with NYHA functional class and is associated with higher levels of morbidity.9&#xD;
      Several therapies in HF, notably ACE inhibition and AII Receptor Blockade have been shown to&#xD;
      have anti-cytokine effects.10 Statins have been shown to reduce levels of circulating&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines in IHD. Recent data using atorvastatin has suggested that significant&#xD;
      reductions in C-reactive protein levels are only seen in the patients with the highest&#xD;
      pre-existing levels.11&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic inflammation can promote excessive cardiomyocyte loss, cardiac fibroblast&#xD;
      proliferation, increased rates of extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover and altered composition&#xD;
      of the ECM resulting in reduced functional performance of the heart.12-17&#xD;
&#xD;
      Natriuretic peptides have been shown to be useful markers for screening, diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment monitoring in heart failure. New data suggests that BNP may be an important&#xD;
      counter-regulatory protein operating through the natriuretic peptide receptor type-A (NPRA)&#xD;
      as a protective response, not only to stretch and volume overload in the myocardium13 but&#xD;
      also to myocardial fibrosis and inflammation.18&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, from a clinical practice point of view the under usage of statins in heart&#xD;
      failure populations may reflect the ongoing debate about their efficacy, safety and the&#xD;
      potential for adverse drug interactions in this patient population. From a mechanistic point&#xD;
      of view, the potential benefits of statins in heart failure may relate to direct improvements&#xD;
      in ischemia and/or cardiac function and may be mediated via suppression of inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines, alteration of myocardial fibrosis and may be unrelated to cholesterol lowering&#xD;
      effects. This project will have two phases with the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Objective 1] To evaluate the usage of statins in a community heart failure population&#xD;
      admitted to our institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Objective 2] To study the impact of statin therapy on natriuretic peptides, inflammatory&#xD;
      markers and markers of fibrosis in a population with heart failure and normal cholesterol&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate objective 2, a prospective, randomized, open-label study of mild to moderate HF&#xD;
      patients was approved by the St Vincent's University Hospital ethics committee. All recruited&#xD;
      patients give their informed consent and are randomized using a computer generated protocol&#xD;
      to atorvastatin therapy [Intervention group (I)] or no statin therapy [Control group (C)] for&#xD;
      a six month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, a further group of individuals without heart failure or proven cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease and with normal cholesterol are enrolled for the purposes of baseline comparison&#xD;
      (Normal group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the randomized study, all patients have mild to moderate HF (NYHA class II-III) of any&#xD;
      aetiology and documented left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVEF &lt; 45%) by&#xD;
      echocardiography within 3 months of randomization. These patients are clinically stable, on&#xD;
      optimal HF medical therapy which had remained unaltered for at least four weeks prior to&#xD;
      recruitment. All have normal fasting total cholesterol (TC &lt; 5.1 mmol/L). The following&#xD;
      patients are excluded from the study: those receiving lipid lowering agents; those with&#xD;
      absolute or relative contraindications to statins; those with known chronic inflammatory&#xD;
      conditions; patients with medical conditions requiring anti-inflammatory or&#xD;
      immuno-suppressive therapies. The same exclusion criteria are applied to the Normal group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to optimal HF therapy, the I group (n=28) receive atorvastatin titrated from&#xD;
      10-40 mg/day over 3 months and maintained at 40mg/day for a further 3 months. The C group&#xD;
      (n=28) receive optimal HF medication only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo routine clinical examination at the heart failure unit, which includes&#xD;
      clinical history, physical examination and chest X-Ray appearance. Fasting Blood samples are&#xD;
      taken and stored for subsequent measurement of cholesterol, FBC, High Sensitivity CRP, TNF&#xD;
      alpha, IL-6, U &amp; E, TFT, BNP and markers of collagen turnover. 12-lead ECG and&#xD;
      Echocardiography is performed at baseline and six months. The Minnesota Living With Heart&#xD;
      Failure (MLWHF) questionnaire was self-administered at baseline and 6 months. The Normal&#xD;
      group underwent phlebotomy at baseline to enable comparison with the HF study sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine clinical review at the heart failure unit is carried out during the trial, including&#xD;
      clinical examination FBC (including LFTs), U &amp; E and assessment for side effects. The&#xD;
      patients are advised to attend their general practitioner for all non heart failure related&#xD;
      problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons between the Normal group and the randomized study patients (C and I groups) at&#xD;
      baseline are made using independent t-test, Mann Whitney or chi square test where&#xD;
      appropriate. Due to non normal distributions in the biochemical markers and lipids,&#xD;
      Friedman's ANOVA is used to test for treatment effects over the study period. Pairwise&#xD;
      comparisons are made using the Wilcoxon test. Repeated measures analysis of variance (RM&#xD;
      ANOVA) is used to test treatment effects on quality of life (QOL) and LVEF. To enable&#xD;
      statistical control for the effects of age and gender, non normal variables are log&#xD;
      transformed and a RM ANCOVA fit to the data. Correlations are computed using Spearman's rank&#xD;
      order correlation.&#xD;
