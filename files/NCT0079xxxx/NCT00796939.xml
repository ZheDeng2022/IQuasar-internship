      This study will determine if green light exposure during sleep is effective in reducing mild&#xD;
      depression symptoms in young men.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The circadian rhythm is the human body's internal clock. It affects sleeping and wakefulness&#xD;
      patterns. Some scientists theorize that a disruption of circadian rhythms, or other circadian&#xD;
      abnormalities, can cause a depressed state. Light received through the eyes can alter the&#xD;
      circadian rhythm, and sustained exposure to artificial bright light during the last half of&#xD;
      usual sleep time can change the phase of the circadian rhythm. Several studies have found&#xD;
      that exposure to bright white light in the morning hours is an effective treatment for&#xD;
      depression, especially during the first week of depression treatment. Other studies have&#xD;
      shown that green or blue light is preferable to yellow or red light in depression treatment.&#xD;
      This study will expose young men to different types of light during the last part of their&#xD;
      sleep cycle to determine whether the treatment is safe and tolerable and whether it reduces&#xD;
      mood disturbance and depression. The study will also determine the light's effect on the&#xD;
      production of luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone, hormones that may play a role in&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will last 15 days. At the beginning of the study, participants&#xD;
      will be provided with study materials and instructed in their use. These materials will&#xD;
      include a wrist actigraph, which is a sleep and wakefulness monitoring device similar to a&#xD;
      wristwatch; a binder containing instructions, questionnaires, and forms; and a light mask.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive a light mask with either intense green or&#xD;
      dim red light. Participants will wear the wrist actigraph throughout the study. For the first&#xD;
      3 days of the study, participants will sleep normally and fill out questionnaires and a sleep&#xD;
      diary. The questionnaires will measure mood, sleepiness, sleep quality, treatment effects,&#xD;
      and sleep time preference. The sleep diary will be a record of time spent sleeping, time it&#xD;
      takes to fall asleep, number of times waking during the night, and similar measures. Starting&#xD;
      on the third night, participants will wear the light mask when sleeping. Every day&#xD;
      participants will fill out the questionnaires and sleep diary, and they will contact the&#xD;
      study investigators to ensure compliance and to ask any questions. Participants will also&#xD;
      provide saliva and urine samples once at the beginning and once at the end of the study.&#xD;
      These samples will be used to test for testosterone and LH, respectively.&#xD;
