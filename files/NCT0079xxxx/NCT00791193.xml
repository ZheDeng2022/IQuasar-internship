  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and relative&#xD;
      bioavailability of paliperidone ER formulations with slow, target, and fast in vitro release&#xD;
      rates after administration of a single 12 mg dose. The slow and fast releasing ER tablets&#xD;
      have in vitro release rates outside the current commercial specifications. Therefore, in&#xD;
      order to support widening of the specification limits, this study will be performed. The&#xD;
      target formulation to be used is representative of the commercial formulation. Other&#xD;
      objectives of this study are 1) to compare the relative bioavailability of paliperidone ER&#xD;
      formulations with slow, target, and fast in vitro release rates to the paliperidone IR&#xD;
      formulation; 2) to explore the in vitro in vivo correlation (IVIVC) for the paliperidone ER&#xD;
      formulation; and 3) to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the different paliperidone ER&#xD;
      formulations.&#xD;

      This is a randomized, open-label, 4-way crossover, single dose study in healthy male&#xD;
      volunteers to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profiles of paliperidone ER tablets with slow,&#xD;
      target, and fast in vitro release rates and paliperidone IR. The study consists of a 21 day&#xD;
      screening phase, an open-label treatment phase consisting of 4 single-dose treatment periods&#xD;
      (IR, slow, fast, and target formulations), and an end-of-study or early withdrawal phase. A&#xD;
      10- to 21 day washout period (i.e., &gt;5 times the half-life) will separate each study drug&#xD;
      administration (i.e., each open label treatment period). In the first period, all volunteers&#xD;
      are given a 1-mg dose of paliperidone IR solution, administered as a single oral dose under&#xD;
      fasted conditions (Treatment A). On Day 1 of Period 2, prior to study drug administration,&#xD;
      all volunteers will be randomly assigned to 1 of 6 possible treatment sequences to ensure&#xD;
      that they receive all of the following treatments, one in each period: 12-mg paliperidone ER&#xD;
      tablet with a target in vitro release under fasted condition (Treatment B); 12-mg&#xD;
      paliperidone ER tablet with a slow in vitro release under fasted condition (Treatment C);&#xD;
      12-mg paliperidone ER tablet with a fast in vitro release under fasted condition (Treatment&#xD;
      D). In each treatment period, volunteers will enter the study center at least 10 hours before&#xD;
      the study drug administration on Day 1 and will remain there until after collection of the 96&#xD;
      hour pharmacokinetic samples on Day 5 if the investigator considers that the volunteer is&#xD;
      ready for discharge. It is expected that the differences in the in vitro release rate will&#xD;
      not affect the relative bioavailability of paliperidone in vivo. Safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      the different paliperidone ER formulations will be monitored throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single oral doses of paliperidone ER 12 mg tablets with different release rates (target,&#xD;
      fast, and slow); single oral dose of paliperidone IR 1 mg&#xD;
