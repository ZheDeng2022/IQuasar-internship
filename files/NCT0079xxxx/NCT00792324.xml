    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine the effect of switching from an antiretroviral&#xD;
      combination that includes efavirenz (Susitiva®), in individuals experiencing&#xD;
      efavirenz-related side effects, and replacing this with an investigational HIV medication&#xD;
      called Etravirine (TMC125).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will primarily investigate the effect of change in medication on your viral load&#xD;
      (the levels of the HIV virus in your blood), on immunological parameters (CD4 count), on&#xD;
      other safety parameters (such as cholesterol) your side effects and also on your quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of individuals who commence treatment for HIV in the UK start with a regimen&#xD;
      that includes EFV in combination with other antiretrovirals. These regimens are convenient&#xD;
      (once daily dosing) and highly efficacious. However EFV has several potential drawbacks&#xD;
      including continued CNS toxicity, the potential for teratogenesis and a low barrier to the&#xD;
      development of virological resistance. In the past the only alternative NNRTI available was&#xD;
      nevirapine which appears to have a lower rate of virological success and is associated with&#xD;
      potentially life threatening toxicities including hepatotoxicity and cutaneous toxicity&#xD;
      including the Stevens-Johnson syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically controlled trials frequently reported undesirable nervous system side effects in&#xD;
      patients receiving 600 mg EFV with other antiretroviral agents, including dizziness,insomnia,&#xD;
      somnolence, impaired concentration and abnormal dreaming. CNS symptoms of moderate to severe&#xD;
      intensity were experienced by 19.4% of patients compared to 9.0% of patients receiving&#xD;
      control regimens. These symptoms were severe in 2.0% of patients receiving EFV 600 mg daily&#xD;
      and in 1.3% of patients receiving control regimens. In clinical studies 2.1% of patients&#xD;
      treated with 600 mg of EFV discontinued therapy because of nervous system symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nervous system symptoms usually begin during the first one or two days of therapy and often&#xD;
      resolve after the first 2 -4 weeks. However in a significant proportion of individuals it&#xD;
      continues with an adverse effect on quality of life. CNS toxicity may also worsen drug&#xD;
      compliance. In a study of uninfected volunteers, a representative nervous system symptom had&#xD;
      a median time to onset of 1 hour post dose and a median duration of 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nervous system symptoms may occur more frequently when EFV is taken concomitantly with meals&#xD;
      possibly due to increased EFV plasma. Dosing at bedtime seems to improve the tolerability of&#xD;
      these symptoms and can be recommended during the first weeks of therapy and in patients who&#xD;
      continue to experience symptoms although this is not always successful and may be associated&#xD;
      with vivid or disturbing dreams. Dose reduction or splitting the daily dose has not been&#xD;
      shown to provide benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other adverse events associated with efavirenz include rash (5-26%, usually minor),increased&#xD;
      cholesterol (20-40%) and triglycerides (6-11%), diarrhea (3-14%), nausea and hyperglycemia&#xD;
      (2-5%). Serious psychiatric adverse events such as precipitation of psychosis, seizure,&#xD;
      suicidal ideation, paranoia, mania and aggression have also been associated with use. These&#xD;
      are seen in &lt;1% taking EFV and are thought to be more likely in those with a history of&#xD;
      mental illness/drug abuse or predisposition to psychological reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMC125 is a diarylpyrimidine derivative that has proven efficacy against HIV-1 including&#xD;
      activity in viral isolates with existing NNRTI signature mutations. Resistance to TMC125 also&#xD;
      appears to develop less readily than to EFV and NVP. This has been attributed to its&#xD;
      molecular structure. TMC125 has demonstrated safety and efficacy in short term studies in&#xD;
      both treatment-naïve and NNRTI-resistant HIV-1 infected patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently published results from phase 3 trials give further support to these findings with&#xD;
      efficacy in reduction of HIV-1-RNA levels seen in patients with substantial NNRTI and PI&#xD;
      resistance when treated with TMC125 plus an optimized background.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMC-125 is generally well tolerated and in particular has lower reported rates of CNS&#xD;
      toxicity than EFV. Animal studies have shown a low risk of teratogenesis. The major toxicity&#xD;
      of TMC125 has been skin rash which is usually self-limiting. In the repeated dose trials the&#xD;
      adverse events (AEs) reported in more than 10% of all subjects were headache, somnolence,&#xD;
      diarrhea, flatulence, nausea and vomiting, fatigue, fever, rash,and pruritus. Overall, AEs&#xD;
      were mild to moderate in intensity, with no apparent doseresponse relationship. No consistent&#xD;
      or clinically relevant changes in electrocardiogram (ECG) or vital signs were observed with&#xD;
      single and repeated TMC125 dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMC125 is a new NNRTI with proven efficacy against HIV-1 with several potential advantages&#xD;
      over EFV including no CNS toxicity and a high barrier to the development of resistance. This&#xD;
      study aims to investigate whether substitution of EFV with TMC125 leads to improvement of CNS&#xD;
      toxicity with continued virological suppression and immunological reconstitution and whether&#xD;
      this is associated with an improvement in quality of life.&#xD;
