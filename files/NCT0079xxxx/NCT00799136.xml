  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      No standard regimen currently exists for the treatment of AIDS-related lymphoma. Based on the&#xD;
      encouraging NCI results with DA-EPOCH, the US AIDS Malignancy Consortium is currently&#xD;
      administering a phase II randomized protocol comparing EPOCH with sequential versus&#xD;
      concurrent rituximab (AMC protocol 034). In this AMC trial, the decision to co-administer&#xD;
      cART is left to the discretion of the treating physician and the patient. While the AMC phase&#xD;
      II study may establish an acceptable chemotherapy regimen suitable for further study in a&#xD;
      phase III randomized trial, the results will not address adherence, pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      interactions or the role of cART in AIDS-related lymphoma. The contribution of cART to the&#xD;
      anti-lymphoma efficacy of any regimen needs to be formally studied. Our proposed trial to&#xD;
      demonstrate the feasibility of co-administering cART with chemotherapy would justify the use&#xD;
      of combined therapy in future AMC/International phase III protocols.&#xD;

      Study Design &amp; Duration This is a prospective, single-arm, multi-centre, phase II trial of&#xD;
      immuno-chemotherapy (rituximab and EPOCH) with mandatory combination antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
      for initial treatment of AIDS-related lymphoma. Patients diagnosed with previously-untreated&#xD;
      AIDS-related diffuse large B-cell lymphoma will be eligible for this trial. Patients are&#xD;
      eligible regardless of whether they have previously been treated with or are naïve to&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy. The total sample size of 18 patients is required to determine the&#xD;
      feasibility of co-administering cART and chemotherapy as measured by adequate adherence to&#xD;
      the antiretroviral regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive EPOCH and rituximab chemotherapy for 6 cycles each given every 21 days.&#xD;
      Day 1 of each cycle will consist of an infusion of rituximab followed by the initiation of a&#xD;
      96-hour continuous infusion of etoposide, doxorubicin, and vincristine and oral prednisone.&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide will be administered on Day 5 with initial dose based on initial CD4+ cell&#xD;
      count to minimize hematologic toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combination antiretroviral therapy will be administered to all patients enrolled in the&#xD;
      trial. Patients already responding to their current cART regimen will continue with the same&#xD;
      therapy. Otherwise, patients can be initiated on a preferred regimen of tenofovir (TDF),&#xD;
      emtricitabine (FTC), and efavirenz (EFV) according to the US Department of Health and Human&#xD;
      Services (DHHS) guidelines. Patients initiated on the preferred regimen of TDF/FTC/EFV will&#xD;
      start the antiretroviral treatments on Day 7 of the trial, after the first cycle of R-EPOCH&#xD;
      is administered. Treatment will subsequently be continued for the duration of the trial and&#xD;
      thereafter, according to the discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint for this feasibility study will be medication adherence to cART&#xD;
      treatment. &quot;Acceptable adherence&quot; will be defined as the proportion of patients able to&#xD;
      complete &gt;90% of all prescribed cART doses during the course of chemotherapy as measured by&#xD;
      pill counts. As previously reported, study participants will be asked to bring their pill&#xD;
      bottles to clinic prior to each chemotherapy cycle (every three weeks) so that remaining&#xD;
      pills can be counted by the participating study nurse/pharmacist. The number of missed doses&#xD;
      will be computed from the difference between the actual and expected number of pills&#xD;
      remaining in the bottle. Secondary outcomes include the toxicity of the combination therapy,&#xD;
      as measured by adverse events graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse&#xD;
      Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0. CD4+ cell counts and HIV-1 mRNA viral loads will be obtained on&#xD;
      all patients at baseline, following recovery from cycles 3 and 6, and every three months&#xD;
      thereafter for two years. Secondary outcomes will also include complete and partial lymphoma&#xD;
      response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival, all defined by International&#xD;
      Working Group criteria. The pharmacokinetics of etoposide, vincristine and doxorubicin will&#xD;
      be studied in the patients initiating the preferred antiretrovirals TDF/3TC/EFV on Day 7 of&#xD;
      the protocol (after completion of the first cycle of R-EPOCH). Thus the analysis of PK&#xD;
      interactions will be on this subgroup of patients receiving a uniform treatment strategy.&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics will be assessed with the first cycle (when chemotherapy is given alone) and&#xD;
      subsequent cycle of R-EPOCH (when chemotherapy is given with cART).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study administration and data collection will occur under the auspices of the Ontario&#xD;
      Clinical Oncology Group (OCOG). OCOG operates from within the Clinical Trials Methodology&#xD;
      Group at the Henderson Research Centre in Hamilton and is co-directed by oncologists at the&#xD;
      Juravinski Cancer Centre and Toronto Sunnybrook Cancer Centres. OCOG has a well-established&#xD;
      research environment to guide the administration of this trial across four unique clinical&#xD;
      sites across Canada. The clinical sites for the study include Toronto Sunnybrook Regional&#xD;
      Cancer Centre (TSRCC), Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH), St. Michael's Hospital (SMH), and at&#xD;
      the St. Paul's Hospital (SPH) in Vancouver. Each clinical site is expected to enroll 1-4&#xD;
      patients per year. An overall accrual rate of 8-10 patients per year is expected. Therefore,&#xD;
      it will be possible to register 18 patients within 2 years of study initiation. For the&#xD;
      individual patient, the chemotherapy treatment duration is 18 weeks. Following this phase of&#xD;
      therapy (18 weeks), individual patients will be followed every 3 months for an additional 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
