      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether aspirin (ASA) can lower the incidence of Venous Thromboembolism(VTE) in&#xD;
      patients with Glioblastoma (GBM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine clinical and laboratory factors which are associated with increased risk of VTE&#xD;
&#xD;
      If it is determined that ASA reduces the incidence of VTE in patients with GBM, then to&#xD;
      determine the clinical and laboratory factors which are associated with an increased benefit&#xD;
      from the drug.&#xD;

      Study Drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aspirin is designed to make blood less &quot;sticky&quot; and reduce its chances of clotting. By making&#xD;
      blood less sticky, it may be less likely to allow a clot to form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as&#xD;
      in the toss of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. If you are assigned to Group 1, you will take&#xD;
      aspirin. If you are in Group 2, you will take a placebo. A placebo is a substance that looks&#xD;
      like the study drug but has no active ingredients. You will have an equal chance of being&#xD;
      placed in either group. Neither you nor your study doctor will know what group you are in. In&#xD;
      case of an emergency, the study staff will be able to find out which group you are in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are assigned to Group 1, you will take 1 aspirin tablet, once a day, by mouth. Aspirin&#xD;
      should be taken with food and may be taken at any time during the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are assigned to Group 2, you will take 1 placebo tablet once a day, by mouth. The&#xD;
      placebo should be taken with food and may be taken at any time during the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      While on study you will have tests and procedures performed at the same time as each routine&#xD;
      clinical visit and when the study doctor thinks it may be necessary. The following tests and&#xD;
      procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be checked for VTE at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests at least once every 8 weeks. Blood&#xD;
           samples will not be routinely collected if you are not receiving any chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to see how well your blood clots about 4 months&#xD;
           after you begin treatment. If you show signs of VTE, this test will be done on the first&#xD;
           visit after the signs are shown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may remain on-study for as long as you are benefiting. If the disease gets worse or&#xD;
      intolerable side effects occur, you may be taken off of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once you are off-study, you will have an end-of-study visit. At this visit, the following&#xD;
      tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your complete medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have performance status evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any medications you may be taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be checked for VTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to see how well your blood clots.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you have symptoms of VTE, you will have a Doppler ultrasound test of your legs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study staff will call you or a member of your family every 3 months, after your last&#xD;
      clinic visit, to follow your health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Aspirin is approved by the FDA and commercially available.&#xD;
      Its use in lowering the risk of VTE is investigational. Aspirin, and the study-related&#xD;
      tests/procedures will be provided free of charge to you while on this study. Up to 224&#xD;
      patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
