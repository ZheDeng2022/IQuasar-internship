      Primary: to identify physiologic indicators of venlafaxine treatment response using&#xD;
      quantitative EEG (QEEG) cordance, and to determine if cordance changes are specifically&#xD;
      associated with response to venlafaxine;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: to determine if cordance changes early in the course (i.e., prior to improvement&#xD;
      in clinical symptoms) of venlafaxine (or another antidepressant if venlafaxine is not&#xD;
      clinically indicated for a particular patient) are predictive of later clinical response.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After a one-week single-blind placebo lead in, subjects will be randomly assigned to either&#xD;
      venlafaxine or placebo for 8 weeks. They will undergo 6 QEEG studies (end of wash-in, and 48&#xD;
      hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks after randomized treatment), with examiner and&#xD;
      self-ratings of mood, anxiety, and clinical status at the time of each recording (Ham-D,&#xD;
      MADRS, Ham-A, SCL-90, Beck, LIFE, and CGI) to assess improvement. Any subjects with&#xD;
      significant deterioration in mood and/or suicidal ideation during the 8 week trial will be&#xD;
      dropped from the study and placed in open treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of 8 weeks, code will be broken and all subjects will be maintained/re-assigned to&#xD;
      open-label treatment with venlafaxine for an additional 10 months if they wish. However, if&#xD;
      the subject's primary physician believes that another clinically available antidepressant&#xD;
      would be indicated instead of venlafaxine (due to history of prior non-response to&#xD;
      venlafaxine, etc.), the indicated antidepressant medication will be administered. The&#xD;
      antidepressant medication recommended by the primary physician will be provided free of&#xD;
      charge for a one-year period. Tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors will&#xD;
      not be included due to the greater possibility of serious clinical sequelae with these older&#xD;
      medications. The open-label phase will consist of regular monitoring by the laboratory at&#xD;
      intervals of three days and one week after beginning a new antidepressant medication, and&#xD;
      then monthly clinical visits (or more frequently if clinically indicated) with QEEG&#xD;
      recordings and assessments of mood and clinical status as above by the laboratory&#xD;
      psychiatrist to ensure that the subject is getting appropriate care from his or her primary&#xD;
      physician. Drug dose will be adjusted using standard clinical practice by the subject's&#xD;
      primary physician in the community, and if the subject remains on venlafaxine, the dosage may&#xD;
      be increased as high as 225 mg/day during this phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have one additional follow-up QEEG at the end of the open-label phase or when&#xD;
      significant clinical improvement is detected (defined as resolution of DSM-IV symptoms, or&#xD;
      Ham-D &lt; 9). After the subject's depression resolves, he or she will continue to be monitored&#xD;
      and given medication free of charge for the remainder of the one-year period, but will be&#xD;
      seen clinically only by the primary physician in the community. A study psychiatrist will be&#xD;
      available for consultation in cases of clinical necessity until the primary physician can be&#xD;
      contacted. Subjects for whom venlafaxine is not clinically indicated and/or subjects who&#xD;
      refuse the placebo portion of the study may be allowed to bypass the placebo-controlled phase&#xD;
      and proceed directly to the open-label phase.&#xD;

    <description>venlafaxine 37.5 mg. or placebo will be prepared by the UCLA Pharmacy for the initial phase of the study. For the open-label phase of the study, subjects will receive the medication and dosage that is clinically indicated by the subject's primary physician in the community.
