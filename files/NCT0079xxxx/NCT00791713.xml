  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a CYP2D6 inhibitor, paroxetine, on&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of orally administered paliperidone ER and to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability of both treatments in healthy men&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, single-center, single-dose, 2 treatment, 2 way crossover&#xD;
      study. It consists of 3 phases: a screening phase beginning within 21 days before the first&#xD;
      study drug administration; an open label treatment phase consisting of 2 treatment periods&#xD;
      (Period 1 and Period 2), during which patients will receive 2 single doses of 3 mg&#xD;
      paliperidone ER; and end of study evaluations upon completion of all the study procedures in&#xD;
      Period 2 or at early withdrawal. All volunteers will receive each of the following 2&#xD;
      treatments in random order: Treatment A: 1 tablet of 3 mg paliperidone ER in the fasted&#xD;
      state; Treatment B: one 20 mg paroxetine tablet once a day from Day 1 to Day 13 and 1 tablet&#xD;
      of 3 mg paliperidone ER on Day 10 in the fasted state. Successive paliperidone ER&#xD;
      administrations will be separated by a washout period of at least 14 days and no more than 28&#xD;
      days. Paroxetine is a potent and selective CYP2D6 inhibitor. Inhibitors of CYP2D6 such as&#xD;
      paroxetine have been reported to increase the plasma concentrations of antipsychotics such as&#xD;
      perphenazine, clozapine, and risperidone. Because paliperidone ER and paroxetine could&#xD;
      potentially be used in combination in schizophrenic patients, the potential for a drug-drug&#xD;
      interaction between paroxetine and paliperidone ER needs to be explored.The safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of the 3 mg tablet of paliperidone ER administered with and without paroxetine&#xD;
      to healthy men will be monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two single oral doses of paliperidone ER 3-mg; 20-mg paroxetine orally once a day for 13 days&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index (weight [kg]/height [m2]) of 18 to 30 kg/m2, inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Extensive metabolizer of CYP2D6. Volunteers whose CYP2D6 genotype is unknown should&#xD;
             have been phenotyped before the start of the study using dextromethorphan as a probe&#xD;
             (i.e., have a dextromethorphan metabolic ratio &lt;0.02, as determined according to the&#xD;
             standard procedures of the study center)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a supine (after 5 minutes rest) blood pressure between 100 and 140 mmHg systolic,&#xD;
             inclusive, and 50 and 90 mmHg diastolic, inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Smokes no more than 10 cigarettes, or 2 cigars, or 2 pipes per day and has been&#xD;
             following this pattern for at least 3 months before screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy on the basis of a prestudy physical examination, medical history, 12-lead ECG,&#xD;
             and the laboratory results of serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis performed&#xD;
             within 21 days before the first dose. If the results of the serum chemistry,&#xD;
             hematology, or urinalysis testing are not within the laboratory's reference ranges,&#xD;
             the volunteer can be included only if the investigator judges that the deviations are&#xD;
             not clinically significant. For renal function tests, the values must be within the&#xD;
             normal laboratory reference ranges&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             phenotyping using dextromethorphan&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known drug allergy to risperidone, paliperidone, paroxetine, or any of their&#xD;
             excipients&#xD;
