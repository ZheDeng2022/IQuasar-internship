  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following the loss of teeth, the alveolar bone formed in response to the eruption of the&#xD;
      teeth is gradually resorbed by the body. In conventional dental implant therapy, a wide&#xD;
      safety margin of uninterrupted healing (3-6 months) following placement of the implants is&#xD;
      used to assure a predictable survival of the implants (on the order of &gt; 90%). In the past&#xD;
      few years, there have been multiple studies documenting with improved implant surface&#xD;
      technologies available, that dental implants can be put into function far sooner than&#xD;
      conventionally thought. The investigators are currently performing recalls on subjects&#xD;
      treated in a research protocol at the University of Iowa (YAOSS-0001; IRB 200305001). Since&#xD;
      this initial study, a shortened version of the implant device has been developed and has&#xD;
      obtained FDA clearance (FDA 510k 063779 clearance letter dated April 27, 2007) for a 4mm&#xD;
      diameter by 6mm in length dental implant. In a case study the investigators are proposing to&#xD;
      repeat the same protocol as used in the initial trial with the following exceptions: only&#xD;
      this one implant type will be used, no bone compression surgical techniques will be used&#xD;
      (referred to as &quot;osteotome&quot; indirect sinus lifting). Our initial trial has documented good&#xD;
      performance with minimal bone loss and a 98.3% cumulative survival rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be an open, prospective case-series clinical documentation study to document the&#xD;
      clinical efficacy of the 4.0mm diameter x 6 mm in length implant (Astra Tech Dental Implant,&#xD;
      Fixture OsseospeedTM ) in the treatment of subjects missing teeth in the upper jaw. A minimum&#xD;
      of two but preferably three implants shall be considered for each surgical site. A total of&#xD;
      20 subjects fulfilling all inclusion criteria will be enrolled. Subjects will have a complete&#xD;
      diagnostic work-up performed and assessment for eligibility in the study by both a&#xD;
      Prosthodontist and Surgeon. Subjects will then have the implants placed in an out patient&#xD;
      basis at the College of Dentistry. The subjects will not wear a conventional removable&#xD;
      partial during the initial six weeks of healing. At six weeks, an assessment of the implants&#xD;
      shall be made by the surgical and restorative team and if a set of safety benchmarks are met,&#xD;
      provisional crowns will be made to place the implants into clinical function (mastication).&#xD;
      Over the first year, the provisional crowns will be periodically removed and a series of&#xD;
      clinical measurements and mobility measurements made. At the end of 1 year following&#xD;
      placement, the permanent crowns or bridgework will be constructed and the subject followed&#xD;
      annually for another four years (five years total from placement). A total of 15 clinical&#xD;
      visits are estimated per subject.&#xD;

      Subjects will have costs for being in this research study. The costs are for the charges for&#xD;
      the dental surgeon who performs the dental implant surgery. Subjects will have a choice of&#xD;
      either a College of Dentistry faculty or resident to perform the surgery. The residents are&#xD;
      dentists who are receiving specialized training in either Oral Surgery or Periodontics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a subject chooses a College of Dentistry Faculty Dentist, the costs are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For two implants = $4,650.00 For three implants = $6,600.00&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you choose a College of Dentistry Resident Dentist, the costs are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For two implants = $3,860.00 For three implants = $5,435.00&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dental implant, abutment and false tooth will be provided to each subject at no cost by&#xD;
      Astra Tech AB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a subject has dental insurance the cost of the surgeon may be covered by your insurance.&#xD;
      Potential subjects should check with their insurance carrier regarding coverage prior to&#xD;
      agreeing to participate in the research study. Any insurance co-payments that are required&#xD;
      will be a cost to the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Materials This will be an open, prospective case-series clinical documentation&#xD;
      study to document the clinical efficacy of the 4.0mm diameter x 6 mm in length implant (Astra&#xD;
      Tech Dental Implant, Fixture OsseospeedTM ) in the treatment of subjects missing teeth in the&#xD;
      posterior maxilla (referred to as a Kennedy class I or class II situation). A minimum of two&#xD;
      but preferably three implants shall be considered for each surgical site. A total of 20&#xD;
      subjects fulfilling all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusions criteria will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Bilateral posterior maxilla treatment can be provided (2-3 implants pre-side) but&#xD;
      each side must follow the inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a five-year follow up study with 15 clinic visits. Interim analyses will be&#xD;
      performed at 6 months and at 1 and 3 years after loading of the temporary prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study comprises the following three periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-surgical evaluation and planning (0 weeks to implant surgery) Surgical and prosthetic&#xD;
      treatment (Surgery to 52 weeks/12 months) Follow-up (12 months to 60 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening procedure will include a clinical and radiographic assessment. Pre-existing&#xD;
      radiographs (e.g. panoramic and intraoral periapical images) can be used but must not be&#xD;
      older than 6 months. A minimum of 5 mm height (alveolar ridge to sinus floor) is required.&#xD;
      Diagnostic steps will involve the fabrication of a surgical guide or surgical denture to&#xD;
      indicate the optimal position of the implants for placement in the posterior upper jaw based&#xD;
      on the available bone. Preliminary diagnostic impressions will made (Penta, 3M ESPE) and&#xD;
      poured in dental stone (Whip Mix Corp., Louisville, KY). Implant subjects may have a&#xD;
      pre-operative Cone Bean CT imaging study made at the College of Dentistry's Department of&#xD;
      Oral Maxillofacial Radiology at the discretion of the Principal Investigator following&#xD;
      diagnostic work-up. Subjects shall be either patients of record of the College of Dentistry&#xD;
      or shall be enrolled if new to the College. Patient records will be electronic along with a&#xD;
      paper version. Paper-based Case Report Forms (CRF) containing subject's medical information&#xD;
      will be kept in one central file in a locked cabinet in the Dental Clinical Research Center.&#xD;
      This data will be kept in a secured file accessible only by the PI and the Clinical&#xD;
      Coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical and prosthetic treatment (Surgery to 52 weeks/12 months) Surgical Intervention: All&#xD;
      surgical procedures will be performed as outpatient procedures at the College of Dentistry in&#xD;
      the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery or in the Department of Periodontics.&#xD;
      Implant placement will follow a one-stage procedure and will be performed under local&#xD;
      anesthesia. Prophylactic antibiotic treatment will be given. One hour prior to surgery&#xD;
      patients will receive the first dose of a 7 - 10 day prophylactic antibiotic treatment&#xD;
      regimen based on Amoxicillin (500mg TID for 7 days) or if allergic to Amoxicillin,&#xD;
      Clindamycin (300 mg QID for 7 days). Details of the treatment will be recorded in the&#xD;
      clinical case report form (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other medication, considered necessary for the patient's welfare, may be given at the&#xD;
      discretion of the investigator(s). The administration of all such medication will be recorded&#xD;
      in the patient's notes as per normal practice. In addition, medication that may have a&#xD;
      negative effect on bone tissue as well as medication to treat any Adverse Event that is&#xD;
      considered to be probably or possibly treatment-related must also be recorded in the&#xD;
      appropriate sections of the Case Report Form (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous conscious sedation is allowed. Conscious out-patient sedation will be &quot;titrated&#xD;
      to effect&quot; for the following medications. The dosages will be varied depending upon the&#xD;
      subject's age, weight and medical status. Versed (1 to 10 mg.) or Valium (1 to 20 mg.),&#xD;
      titrated over the duration of the procedure Fentanyl (0.025 to 0.1 mg) or Demerol (25 to 100&#xD;
      mg), titrated over the duration of the procedure. Phenergan (5 to 25 mg) may be added to&#xD;
      either of the narcotics to potentate their effect and extend working time. At the discretion&#xD;
      of the surgeon, oral sedation can be used as an alternative (e.g., Valium 5-20mg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following achievement of sedation, infiltration of local dental anesthetic is performed [2%&#xD;
      Lidocaine HCL with 1:100,000 epinephrine or 4% Atricaine with Epi 1:100,000] immediately&#xD;
      prior to surgery. Alternatively, a longer acting local anesthetic [0.5% bupivicaine +&#xD;
      1:200,000 epinephrine] may be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, all subjects will be treatment planned for a minimum of two implants spaced 7 mm&#xD;
      apart (center-to-center) in anatomic regions which will provide sufficient alveolar width for&#xD;
      a minimum of 1 mm of bone in all dimensions (minimum of 6 mm ridge width). The objective is&#xD;
      to place two to three implants in the upper posterior jaw. Implants will be positioned&#xD;
      typically in the anterior residual ridge (below the nasal floor of the maxillary sinus where&#xD;
      there is 5 mm or greater than cortical and trabecular bone) and occasionally in the distal&#xD;
      wall of the maxillary sinus. Extensive autogenous bone grafting and/or sinus lift grafting&#xD;
      will not be performed in this trial. In cases of bilateral edentulism a minimum of two&#xD;
      implants will be placed in both locations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides optimal bone support, providing primary stability, the direction/inclination of the&#xD;
      implants in the mesiodistal and buccolingual dimensions shall be governed by the requirements&#xD;
      for a satisfactory final prosthetic function and esthetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lack of Primary Stability: If an implant does not achieve primary stability, a two stage&#xD;
      delayed loading period of 3 months will be performed for all implants placed in this subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of an osteotome: Localized internal sinus floor elevation with simultaneous implant&#xD;
      placement using osteotome technique is not allowed in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cases of sinus perforation will be subjected to standard care of treatment per the&#xD;
      investigators discretion and treatment details subsequently recorded in the Case Report From.&#xD;
      The surgeon should aim for full bone coverage of the implant threads. Where threads are&#xD;
      exposed, augmentation with autogenous bone alone or in combination with Bio-Gide Bilayer&#xD;
      Membrane can be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after implant placement (IP) and abutment connection intraoral radiographs of the&#xD;
      fixtures will be made and primary stability assessed clinically and by Resonance Frequency&#xD;
      Analysis using the OsstellTM device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Osstell device is an FDA approved hand held resonance frequency transducer that measures&#xD;
      the relative bone stiffness around dental implants. The device consists of a transducer that&#xD;
      is connected to the implant or implant abutment and the transducer then applies a small&#xD;
      harmonic steady state swept waveform and a second transducer then detects the stiffness of&#xD;
      the implant and surrounding bone. The basis of the transducer is an off set cantilever beam&#xD;
      (principal of a tuning fork) and the first flexural resonance is then measured. The value of&#xD;
      the response is then computed and presented on a scale of 1-100 Implant Stability Quotient&#xD;
      (ISQ) value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implants will be subjected to a 6-week healing period left in a transmucosal position with&#xD;
      the peri-implant mucosa sutured and closely adapted to the abutments. Subjects will not wear&#xD;
      a pre-existing removable partial denture over the implant sites during the initial 6 week&#xD;
      healing period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments of implant stability will be evaluated at 6 weeks following placement (Temporary&#xD;
      Restoration stage or &quot;TR&quot;), TR +4, 8,12, 26 and 52 weeks respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cases where primary implant stability cannot be achieved the patient will be treated with&#xD;
      a conventional two-stage approach (i.e. submerged healing in combination with an extended&#xD;
      healing period of 3 months before uncovering and loading of the implants). Such patient will&#xD;
      not be excluded from the study but followed for the full course of the study. During the&#xD;
      healing period, patients will be recalled at 2, 4 and 6 weeks following placement. To avoid&#xD;
      overloading of the implants, the patient will not be allowed to wear a removable prosthesis&#xD;
      over the implants during this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT OF FAILING IMPLANTS If an implant is lost (fails), as defined below, the site shall&#xD;
      be treated in the manner best suited to the well being of the subject. Following implant&#xD;
      removal and treatment of the site, the implant may be replaced with another implant or the&#xD;
      site may be allowed to heal for future placement of another implant or the site may be&#xD;
      allowed to heal without implant replacement. No replacement implants shall be entered into&#xD;
      this study. Any implant that is showing excessive bone loss (grater than 5mm), such as&#xD;
      radiolucency or infection, shall be treated in the manner best suited to the well-being of&#xD;
      the patient, including treatment to save the implant. Treatment may include surgical&#xD;
      intervention to resolve infection and/or sequestra and may include administration of topical&#xD;
      or systemic antibiotics. Such events and treatments shall be recorded on the Adverse Event&#xD;
      form. Implants that are successfully treated shall not be considered treatment failures in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up (12 months to 60 months) The patient will return for follow-up visits at TR +24,&#xD;
      36, 48 and 60 months. At all follow-up visits evaluation of soft tissue status and treatment&#xD;
      related complications will be performed together with intraoral radiographs of the implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic assessments/measurements Intraoral periapical radiographs of the implants will&#xD;
      be taken immediately after implant placement, at impression for temporary restoration, at&#xD;
      visit 7, visit 8 and visit 9 (12, 26 respectively 52 weeks after implant placement) and at&#xD;
      follow-up visits after 24, 36, 48 and 60 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following variables will be recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  periimplant radiolucency will be recorded as presence or absence of radiolucency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  marginal bone level will be recorded as the vertical distance from the reference point&#xD;
           to the marginal bone level. The distance will be measured to the nearest 1/10 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OUTCOMES MEASURES The primary outcome measure in this case series evaluation shall be&#xD;
      implant loss (removal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURE Mobility: A free-standing implant is immobile when tested with&#xD;
      instrument pressure. Mobility shall not be quantified. Instead, mobility detectable under the&#xD;
      application of pressure by two opposing instruments to an implant shall be considered an&#xD;
      indication of failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stability: Implant resonance frequency analysis as measured on the &quot;Implant Stability&#xD;
      Quotient&quot; (or ISQ) on a scale of 1-100 will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiolucency: A standard conventional dental radiograph does not show evidence of continuous&#xD;
      peri-implant radiolucency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain, Infection: A successfully integrated implant is characterized by an absence of&#xD;
      persistent or irreversible signs and symptoms such as pain and infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone height: Vertical bone loss of less than 0.2mm annually following the first year of&#xD;
      loading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Adaptation: Patients are satisfied with the esthetics, phonetics and the function of&#xD;
      the implant supported crown.&#xD;
