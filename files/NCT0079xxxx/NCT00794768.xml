    <textblock>
      This was a crossover study designed to see if patients with seasonal allergy symptoms&#xD;
      preferred Clarinex® or Allegra®. Patients were randomized to take 7 days of Clarinex or&#xD;
      Allegra treatment, followed by a 5 to 28-day washout period (days when no drug is given),&#xD;
      followed by 7 days of the opposite treatment. At the end of each 7-day treatment, patients&#xD;
      were asked questions to determine which drug, Clarinex or Allegra, the patient prefers more.&#xD;

          -  had a history of non-compliance with medications or treatment protocols;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  had any clinically significant deviation from normal in the physical examination that,&#xD;

             affect subject safety;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  had any clinically significant metabolic, cardiovascular, immunologic, neurologic,&#xD;
             hematologic, gastrointestinal, cerebrovascular, or respiratory disease, or any other&#xD;
             disorder which, in the judgment of the Investigator, might interfere with the study&#xD;
