    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted according to a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      parallel group design in up to 25 clinical sites in Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned to two parallel treatment groups (1:1 randomization ratio)&#xD;
      receiving either ITF2357, as hard gelatine capsule for oral administration, at the dose of 50&#xD;
      mg b.i.d. (total daily dose of 100 mg), or matching placebo capsules,. Treatment will be&#xD;
      administered on an outpatient basis for 8 consecutive weeks, followed by a 4-week follow-up.&#xD;
      During screening, in the 8-week treatment period and in the 4-week follow-up period, patients&#xD;
      will attend scheduled visits, with physical and laboratory assessments, in order to monitor&#xD;
      disease evolution and safety and tolerability of ITF2357.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in up to 80 patients of both genders, with established diagnosis&#xD;
      of CD, who present with ulcerations greater than aphthous ulcers in at least one of the five&#xD;
      bowel segments investigated endoscopically, from the ileum to the rectum, with endoscopic and&#xD;
      clinical evidence of moderate-to-severe active disease, not controlled by on-going treatment&#xD;
      with conventional therapies such as 5-aminosalycylates, steroids or immunosuppressants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ITF2357 is an orally active, synthetic inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzyme, which&#xD;
      has been demonstrated to selectively inhibit the in-vitro production of pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines and to exhibit in-vivo anti-inflammatory effects, both in animals and in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Crohn's Disease (CD) is a chronic and debilitating inflammatory disease of the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract of unknown aetiology. The disease, which affects slightly more females&#xD;
      than males and has a peak incidence at about 30 years of age, leads to significant physical&#xD;
      morbidity and a marked impairment in quality of life. Abdominal pain and diarrhoea are the&#xD;
      most common symptoms, although patients with CD may also develop a number of other clinical&#xD;
      features such as malnutrition, anemia, osteoporosis, disabling perianal fistulae, and&#xD;
      extra-intestinal symptoms such as fatigue, low-grade fever, arthritis and abnormalities of&#xD;
      liver function. CD may affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract and is characterised by&#xD;
      a pattern of relapses and remissions that may require treatment, including surgical&#xD;
      intervention. More than 70% of subjects will require surgery during the course of their&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study has been designed in order to prove that the short-term (8 weeks) treatment&#xD;
      with oral ITF2357 can induce disease improvement in a substantial proportion of patients. Its&#xD;
      aim is to evaluate whether a short term treatment with ITF2357 for 8 weeks, at the selected&#xD;
      dose of 50 mg b.i.d., is able to induce healing of mucosal lesions, evaluated endoscopically,&#xD;
      in patients with endoscopic and clinical evidence of moderate-to-severe active Crohn's&#xD;
      disease, not controlled by ongoing treatment with conventional therapies such as&#xD;
      5-aminosalycylates, steroids or immunosuppressants.&#xD;
