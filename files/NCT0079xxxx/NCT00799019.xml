  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, immunogenicity surveillance registry employs a prospective, cohort design&#xD;
      for patients who are using erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA)according to normal&#xD;
      practice consistent with the medical indications. Subjects will be observed for the&#xD;
      development of immunogenicity and PRCA for up to 3 years. Information on exposure to ESA&#xD;
      products, ESA product handling and storage, and most recent hemoglobin level will be&#xD;
      collected quarterly in the case report form. For cases of suspected PRCA, that sera specimen&#xD;
      will be tested for EPO antibodies at Division of Nephrology, Chulalongkorn University&#xD;
      Laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An Advisory Board (ADB) will periodically review blinded case data for subjects with&#xD;
      unexplained loss of efficacy (LOE), identify cases of EPO antibody-mediated PRCA and will be&#xD;
      responsible for data summary and make recommendations related to the incidence rate of PRCA&#xD;
      associated with S.C. ESA use. The registry will provide no inducement to change therapy and&#xD;
      will be non-interventional. The primary objective for this study is to estimate the incidence&#xD;
      of anti-human Erythropoiesis and anti-EPO PRCA, develop in such patients. The diagnosis of&#xD;
      PRCA by bone marrow biopsy must be prerequisite before the antibody assay. The secondary&#xD;
      objective is to evaluate the efficacy of ESA for treatment of erythropoiesis deficiency&#xD;
      anemia. Registry subjects will be adult men and women who are receiving or about to receive&#xD;
      (within 1 month) a marketed ESA product by the s.c. route of administration at the time of&#xD;
      enrollment. The marketed ESAs include innovative ESA and biosimilar ESA. Potential subjects&#xD;
      will only be enrolled if they have been receiving an Erythropoiesis product for less than 1&#xD;
      year. Cases of EPO antibody-mediated PRCA will be determined by the clinical presence of&#xD;
      essential criteria of unexplained LOE, administration of ESA product, bone marrow biopsy&#xD;
      diagnosis of PRCA, and presence of EPO antibody. The sera of patients who meet all criteria&#xD;
      will be assayed for neutralization.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Incidence rates of EPO antibody-mediated PRCA will be estimated as the total number of cases&#xD;
      of anti-Erythropoiesis and anti-EPO antibodies mediated PRCA attributed to a specific product&#xD;
      presentation divided by the person-year (PY) of s.c. exposure. Incidence rates will be&#xD;
      adjusted for duration of exposure by stratification. Sensitivity analyses with varying&#xD;
      assumptions on the latency from exposure with Erythropoiesis product to onset of PRCA will be&#xD;
      employed in general and will be evaluated specifically if subjects switch therapy, have mixed&#xD;
      exposure to multiple ESA products by the s.c. route of administration, or discontinue therapy&#xD;
      and remain under observation. Confidence intervals for rate estimates will be calculated&#xD;
      using the Poisson distribution for rare events.&#xD;
