    <textblock>
      People with type 2 diabetes experience heart failure more often than do people without&#xD;
      diabetes. This may be due to increased stiffness in the heart as a result of diabetes. This&#xD;
      study will examine whether exenatide, a medication used to treat diabetes, may have&#xD;
      beneficial effects on the heart in people with type 2 diabetes and heart failure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diastolic heart failure is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the ventricles of&#xD;
      the heart become stiff and do not fully relax, preventing the heart from properly filling&#xD;
      with blood. The circulation of blood then backs up, and blood collects in the body's organs,&#xD;
      primarily the lungs. However, people with diastolic heart failure may have a normal ejection&#xD;
      fraction, which is a measure of the amount of blood that the heart pumps out with each heart&#xD;
      beat. Having type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of diastolic heart failure. Also, people&#xD;
      with both heart failure and type 2 diabetes are more likely to experience poor health and&#xD;
      even death than are people with only heart failure. It is possible that diabetes leads to&#xD;
      increased stiffness of the ventricles and the aorta, which is the main blood vessel into&#xD;
      which the heart empties. Exenatide, part of a class of medications known as glucagon-like&#xD;
      peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, is a new medication that is currently used to treat&#xD;
      elevated blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. Some studies have shown that this class&#xD;
      of medications may have a positive effect on the heart and blood vessels. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to determine the effect that exenatide has on aortic and left ventricular stiffness&#xD;
      in people who have type 2 diabetes and diastolic heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This 12-week study will enroll adults with type 2 diabetes and diastolic heart failure with&#xD;
      normal ejection fraction. At a baseline study visit, participants will undergo a physical&#xD;
      examination, blood pressure and heart rate measurements, a blood collection, an&#xD;
      echocardiogram to obtain images of the heart, and a non-invasive test that measures blood&#xD;
      flow in the aorta. Participants will then be randomly assigned to receive either exenatide or&#xD;
      usual care. Participants who receive exenatide will inject the medicine twice a day for 12&#xD;
      weeks. At Week 4, these participants will attend a study visit to adjust the medication&#xD;
      dosage and to report any problems, and at Week 6, study staff will follow up with&#xD;
      participants by phone. All participants will attend a study visit at Week 12 for repeat&#xD;
      baseline testing.&#xD;
