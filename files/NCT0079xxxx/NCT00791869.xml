  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the investigators research is to see if variants in a particular gene (named&#xD;
      CYP2B6) affect how the body metabolizes (breaks down) certain medications, including the drug&#xD;
      bupropion. Bupropion is widely used in the treatment of depression and for helping people&#xD;
      quit smoking. Genes are portions of DNA that code for particular proteins in the body. The&#xD;
      investigators are studying the gene that codes for a protein called CYP2B6. Differences in&#xD;
      the structure of the gene are called variants and may mean that a person metabolizes a drug&#xD;
      faster or slower than a person with a different variant.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Bupropion is widely used in the treatment of depression and for smoking cessation. It's most&#xD;
      abundant metabolite, hydroxybupropion, may be responsible for most of the therapeutic effect&#xD;
      of bupropion under conditions of long term dosing. Because the primary enzyme involved in&#xD;
      metabolism of bupropion to hydroxybupropion is the liver enzyme CYP2B6, we propose to study&#xD;
      the effect of different CYP2B6 genotypes on the metabolism of bupropion. These data will&#xD;
      guide the use of genotypes as a surrogate for measuring drug blood levels in studying genetic&#xD;
      determinants of outcomes for bupropion treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of Forty-four subjects with 4 different CYP2B6 genotypes will participate in a&#xD;
      7-day study in which they take bupropion as outpatients for 6 days (to achieve steady state&#xD;
      drug levels) and then come to the San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH) Clinical Research&#xD;
      Center for a 1-day admission during which multiple blood and urine samples will be collected&#xD;
      for pharmacokinetic analysis.&#xD;
