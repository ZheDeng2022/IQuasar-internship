      The purpose of this study is to establish bioequivalence of paliperidone ER tablets&#xD;
      manufactured at Gurabo as compared to paliperidone ER tablets manufactured at Vacaville,&#xD;
      administered as a single dose of 12 mg under fasted conditions to healthy male volunteers,&#xD;
      and to assess the safety and tolerability of both formulations.&#xD;

      This is a randomized, open-label, 2-way crossover study in healthy male adults.The study&#xD;
      consists of a screening phase and an open label treatment phase during which each patient&#xD;
      will receive the 2 treatments of the study drug separated by a washout period of 7 to 14&#xD;
      days. Treatment A will consist of a single oral dose of 12-mg paliperidone ER, tablets&#xD;
      manufactured at Gurabo, administered under fasted condition. Treatment B will consist of a&#xD;
      single oral dose of 12-mg paliperidone ER, tablets manufactured at Vacaville, administered&#xD;
      under fasted condition. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis will be collected at&#xD;
      pre-dose and for 96 hours post-dose for each period. As a change in manufacturing site will&#xD;
      take place, bioequivalence between 12 mg tablets (highest dose strength) from the 2&#xD;
      production sites (Gurabo [Puerto Rico, USA] and Vacaville [California, USA]) needs to be&#xD;
      demonstrated. This pivotal bioequivalence study is designed to examine the pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
      safety, and tolerability of paliperidone ER manufactured at Gurabo in comparison with&#xD;
      paliperidone ER manufactured at Vacaville&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two single oral doses of paliperidone ER 12 mg&#xD;
