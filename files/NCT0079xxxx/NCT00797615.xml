  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past 30 years obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the United States (Ogden&#xD;
      et al, 2006). While this epidemic affects all socioeconomic levels, certain racial/ethnic&#xD;
      groups such as Hispanics, are disproportionately affected by obesity and diabetes. The age of&#xD;
      onset of excess obesity in Hispanic females, formerly young adulthood, is now younger.&#xD;
      Childhood obesity poses intermediate and long-term health risks, including: type 2 diabetes,&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia, elevated blood pressure, and metabolic syndrome. Although biological factors&#xD;
      may influence a child's risk for becoming overweight, the home environment has been shown to&#xD;
      be a predisposing and reinforcing contextual factor for unhealthy eating and exercise&#xD;
      behaviors. Since parents are the primary transmitters of Hispanic cultural practices and&#xD;
      significantly influence their children's diet and physical activity behaviors from preschool&#xD;
      through high school, family-based weight-gain prevention interventions are likely to be&#xD;
      effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this implementation study is to contribute to the reduction of racial/ethnic&#xD;
      disparities in obesity and risk of type 2 diabetes by tailoring a recently successful&#xD;
      childhood obesity prevention program originally developed for African American girls to&#xD;
      implement and evaluate with preadolescent Hispanic girls.&#xD;

      Over the past 30 years obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the United States (Ogden&#xD;
      et al, 2006). While this epidemic affects all socioeconomic levels, certain racial/ethnic&#xD;
      groups such as Hispanics, are disproportionately affected by obesity and diabetes. The age of&#xD;
      onset of excess obesity in Hispanic females, formerly young adulthood, is now younger.&#xD;
      Childhood obesity poses intermediate and long-term health risks, including: type 2 diabetes,&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia, elevated blood pressure, and metabolic syndrome (Goran et al 2003; Hale and&#xD;
      Rupert, 2006). Although biological factors may influence a child's risk for becoming&#xD;
      overweight, the home environment has been shown to be a predisposing and reinforcing&#xD;
      contextual factor for unhealthy eating and exercise behaviors (Arredondo et al, 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two recent empirical reviews of childhood obesity interventions demonstrated the increased&#xD;
      effectiveness of family-based approaches (Kitzmann and Beech, 2006; Summerbell et al, 2007).&#xD;
      Since parents are the primary transmitters of Hispanic cultural practices and significantly&#xD;
      influence their children's diet and physical activity behaviors from preschool through high&#xD;
      school (Snethen et al, 2007), family-based weight-gain prevention interventions are likely to&#xD;
      be effective. The sociocultural context of Hispanic girls involves a much higher degree of&#xD;
      interdependence among family members in Hispanic compared to White families (Schwartz, 2007).&#xD;
      In addition to family-based approaches to pediatric obesity prevention, culturally-relevant&#xD;
      and community-based participatory approaches have been strongly recommended by the Institute&#xD;
      of Medicine (IOM) and the Strategic Plan for NIH Obesity Research (NIH, 2004:25).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this implementation study is to contribute to the reduction of racial/ethnic&#xD;
      disparities in obesity and risk of type 2 diabetes by tailoring a recently successful&#xD;
      childhood obesity prevention program originally developed for African American girls to&#xD;
      implement and evaluate with preadolescence Hispanic girls. This project will be a&#xD;
      collaborative, participatory community-academic partnership between Vanderbilt University&#xD;
      Medical Center (VUMC), Tennessee State University (TSU) Center for Health Research, Meharry&#xD;
      Medical College, Progreso Community Center (PCC) and the Nashville Latino Health Coalition&#xD;
      (NLHC). Specifically, the childhood obesity prevention program called Girl's health&#xD;
      Enrichment Multi-site Studies (GEMS) will be tailored to be culturally-appropriate and&#xD;
      piloted in the Hispanic/Latino community in Nashville/Davidson County, Tennessee. Dr. Bettina&#xD;
      Beech led the development of the original GEMS intervention, which was developed and&#xD;
      pilot-tested in Memphis, Tennessee (Beech et al, 2003). We have assembled a&#xD;
      multi-disciplinary team with expertise in pediatric obesity (Drs. Beech, Barkin, and Cook),&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes (Dr. Tom Elasy), community-based participatory research (Drs. Beech, Barkin,&#xD;
      Hull), Hispanic culture (Drs. Hull and Zoorob, PCC), and community engagement (NLHC, PCC, and&#xD;
      Drs. Beech and Hull).&#xD;
