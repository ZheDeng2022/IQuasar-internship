  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the first phase of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable&#xD;
      dose of decitabine and peginterferon alfa-2b that can be given in combination to patients&#xD;
      with melanoma. The safety of this drug combination will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of the second phase are to learn if decitabine and peginterferon alfa-2b combined&#xD;
      can help to control melanoma, and to find out which doses are more effective and/or better&#xD;
      tolerated.&#xD;

      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decitabine is designed to damage the DNA of cells, which may cause cancer cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peginterferon alfa-2b is designed to strengthen the immune system, which may decrease tumor&#xD;
      growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study&#xD;
      group based on when you joined this study. Up to 6 groups of 3-6 participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the Phase I portion of the study, and up to 44 participants will be enrolled in&#xD;
      Phase II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in the Phase I portion, the dose of decitabine and peginterferon alfa-2b&#xD;
      you receive will depend on when you joined this study. The first group of participants will&#xD;
      receive the lowest dose level of the study drug combination. Each new group will receive a&#xD;
      higher dose level than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This&#xD;
      will continue until the highest tolerable dose of the study drug combination is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in the Phase II portion, the dose of decitabine and peginterferon alfa-2b&#xD;
      you receive will depend on when you joined this study, as well as the research data from the&#xD;
      Phase I portion. You will be randomly assigned (as in the roll of dice) to receive one of the&#xD;
      dose levels (which may be from 1 to 6 dose levels, depending on the available data from the&#xD;
      Phase I portion) that have been found in the Phase I portion to have the least side effects&#xD;
      and to be possibly the most effective. This means you will have an equal chance of being&#xD;
      assigned to any of the dose levels that are being used at that time. As the study goes on, if&#xD;
      the research data suggests that one dose level may be better tolerated than the others, new&#xD;
      participants enrolling into the Phase II portion would be more likely to be assigned to that&#xD;
      possibly better dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No matter which phase you are enrolled in, your dose of the study drugs may be lowered if you&#xD;
      do not tolerate the study drug combination well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A &quot;cycle&quot; on this study is 28 days. Decitabine will be given by vein, over 1 hour, on Days&#xD;
      1-5 of each cycle. Peginterferon alfa-2b will be given by injection under the skin, once a&#xD;
      week (on Days 1, 8, 15, and 21). You will be giving peginterferon alfa-2b to yourself under&#xD;
      nursing supervision on the days you are receiving decitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 6 of each cycle, you will either receive Neulasta (pegfilgrastim) or Neupogen&#xD;
      (filgrastim). Pegfilgrastim or filgrastim will be injected under your skin. If you receive&#xD;
      pegfilgrastim, it will be injected only on Day 6 of each cycle. If you receive filgrastim, it&#xD;
      will be injected 1 time a day for as many days as the doctor decides is needed to raise your&#xD;
      white blood cell count.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of each cycle, the following procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any medications or treatments you may be currently receiving and&#xD;
           any side effects you may have experienced.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a performance status evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These same tests listed above will be repeated at additional visits with the research nurse&#xD;
      during Week 3 of Cycles 1 and 2. If you do not experience severe side effects during Cycles 1&#xD;
      and 2, these extra Week 3 visits with the research nurse will no longer be necessary in later&#xD;
      cycles. They may, however, be started again if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of of Cycle 3, and every odd cycle after that (Cycles 5, 7, 9, and so on), you&#xD;
      will have a scan performed (such as CT or MRI) to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may remain on study for as long as you are benefitting. If the disease gets worse or&#xD;
      intolerable side effects occur, you will be taken off study early.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once you go off study for any reason, you will have an end-of-study visit with the same&#xD;
      procedures performed as the Day 1 study visits. You may also have a scan performed (such as&#xD;
      CT or MRI) to check the status of the disease if you have not had one performed in the last 4&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-Term Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 3 months for about 2 years, researchers will call you to see how you are doing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Decitabine is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Peginterferon alfa-2b is FDA approved and&#xD;
      commercially available for the treatment of hepatitis C. Their use together in this study in&#xD;
      the treatment of melanoma is considered experimental. At this time, the combination is being&#xD;
      used in research only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 80 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
