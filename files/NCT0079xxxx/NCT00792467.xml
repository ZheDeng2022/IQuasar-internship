      This study has the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the anti-lymphoma efficacy of daily oral doses of ITF2357 followed by&#xD;
           intravenous Mechlorethamine administered to patients with refractory/relapsed Hodgkin's&#xD;
           lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple courses of ITF2357 followed by&#xD;
      Mechlorethamine in a population of chemotherapy pretreated patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open label, phase II study aimed at testing the activity of multiple&#xD;
      cycles of ITF2357 followed by Mechlorethamine administered to patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive a maximum of twelve 3-week cycles of ITF2357 followed by&#xD;
      Mechlorethamine according to the following schema:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ITF2357, 50 mg every 6 hours, per os, days 1 - 3&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mechlorethamine, 6 mg/sqm, intravenously , day 4 Study therapy will be administered&#xD;
           every 21 days as long as there is no evidence of progressive disease or unacceptable&#xD;
           adverse events or patient's request to discontinue treatment occurs, but in any case for&#xD;
           a maximum of 12 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decision regarding the continuation of ITF2357/Mechlorethamine therapy will be made on (i)the&#xD;
      basis of tumor reassessment following cycles 2, 6, 9, and 12 and (ii) the occurrence of&#xD;
      toxicity. Tumor response will be evaluated according to the International Working Group&#xD;
      response criteria HL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be administrated on an outpatient basis and patients will be followed&#xD;
      regularly with physical and laboratory tests, as specified in the protocol; in case of&#xD;
      hospitalisation, the treatment will be continued or interrupted according to the&#xD;
      Investigators' decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will accrue 23 patients evaluable for efficacy and the anticipated duration of the&#xD;
      study is about 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are enzymes involved in the remodeling of chromatin, and have a&#xD;
      key role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. In addition, the activity of&#xD;
      non-histone proteins can be regulated through HDAC-mediated hypoacetylation. In recent years,&#xD;
      inhibition of HDACs has emerged as a potential strategy to reverse aberrant epigenetic&#xD;
      changes associated with cancer, and several classes of HDAC inhibitors have been found to&#xD;
      have potent and specific anticancer activities in preclinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) is a relatively uncommon lymphoma histotype, with an incidence in&#xD;
      Italy of approximately 1700 new cases per year (approximately 12% of all lymphomas).&#xD;
      Combination chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy cures approximately 70 percent of&#xD;
      advanced-stage HL. Fifty percent of the failing patients can be salvaged by second line&#xD;
      chemotherapy (mainly high-dose regimens), while the remaining patients eventually die by&#xD;
      disease progression. The development of an effective salvage regimen for this&#xD;
      refractory/resistant population represents a true unmet medical need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use in the latter patient subset of HDAC inhibitors, like ITF2357, is supported by&#xD;
      several considerations. Namely: (1) a related hydroxamate, SAHA, has shown activity in this&#xD;
      clinical condition; (2) the drug markedly inhibits the production of several cytokines, and&#xD;
      cytokine production in HL granuloma has a defined role in the pathogenesis of HL; (3) an&#xD;
      effective treatment for refractory/relapsed HL is presently lacking; (4) ITF2357, up to 200&#xD;
      mg daily per os, has shown a favorable toxicity profile. All the above mentioned arguments&#xD;
      represent a strong rationale prompting the use of ITF2357 in this patient population.&#xD;

    <description>OR rate among patients treated is defined according to the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma of the International Working Group.&#xD;
In medicine, a response rate is the percentage of patients whose cancer shrinks or disappears after treatment.&#xD;
The FDA definition of ORR is the proportion of patients with tumor size reduction of a predefined amount and for a minimum time period.&#xD;
The tumor objective response rate (ORR) is an important parameter to demonstrate the efficacy of a treatment in oncology.&#xD;
The ORR is valuable for clinical decision making in routine practice and a significant end-point for reporting the results of clinical trials.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of Responders (Complete -CR- or Partial PR-)</measure>

    <description>Complete responder (CR) and partial responder (PR) among patients treated are defined according to the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma of the International Working Group.&#xD;
CR is defined as complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-related symptoms if present before therapy.&#xD;
PR is defined as regression of measurable disease and no new sites. The frequencies of patients achieving objective response (i.e. subjects whose best overall response was CR or PR) and the frequencies of patients who did not achieve an objective response (i.e.subjects whose best overall response was equal to stable disease - SD, progressive disease - PD - or not evaluable) in ITT and PP populations are reported.&#xD;

    <time_frame>From the first day of the first cycle of treatment until objective tumor progression or death, whichever came first, assessed up to 450 days from the start of the first cycle of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from the 1st day of the 1st cycle of treatment until objective tumor progression or death. It included deaths, thus could be correlated to overall survival. If a patient did not have disease progression, PFS was censored at the date of last available tumor assessment (including those at end of study or follow-up visit).</description>

    <description>TTR is defined as the time from the 1st day of the 1st cycle until the date of achieving a response (CR or PR).&#xD;
In case of no objective response, TTR was censored at the date of last available tumor assessment (including those at end of study or follow-up visit).</description>

        <title>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</title>
        <description>OR rate among patients treated is defined according to the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma of the International Working Group.&#xD;
In medicine, a response rate is the percentage of patients whose cancer shrinks or disappears after treatment.&#xD;
The FDA definition of ORR is the proportion of patients with tumor size reduction of a predefined amount and for a minimum time period.&#xD;
The tumor objective response rate (ORR) is an important parameter to demonstrate the efficacy of a treatment in oncology.&#xD;
The ORR is valuable for clinical decision making in routine practice and a significant end-point for reporting the results of clinical trials.</description>

In case of no objective response, TTR was censored at the date of last available tumor assessment (including those at end of study or follow-up visit).</description>
        <time_frame>From the first day of the first cycle until the date of achieving a response assessed up to 250 days from the start of the first cycle of treatment</time_frame>
        <population>Intent-to-treat population: all patients valid for Safety population. Per Protocol population: all recruited patients who: 1) were not severe protocol violators; 2) had at least one on-study tumor assessment beside baseline; 3) experienced disease progression or, if not, received at least 2 cycles of the study treatment consecutively.</population>
