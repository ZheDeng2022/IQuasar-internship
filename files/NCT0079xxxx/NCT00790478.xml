    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory bowel disease that afflicts up to one million people in&#xD;
      the U.S. Symptoms include rectal urgency, bloody diarrhea, moderate to severe abdominal pain,&#xD;
      fever, and fatigue. Melatonin is a hormone that is associated with sleep and other body&#xD;
      functions that may be related to health. Melatonin is produced in the pineal gland and, in&#xD;
      fact, it is produced in even greater amounts in the gut. Melatonin appears to be important in&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract physiology and health, and data from cell and animal experiments, and&#xD;
      some studies in humans, suggest that supplemental melatonin may help ameliorate colitis.&#xD;
      Given that current treatments for ulcerative colitis are not always effective, and often have&#xD;
      serious side effects, there is considerable interest in finding alternative treatments for&#xD;
      this disease. However, experimental data on the ability of melatonin to improve ulcerative&#xD;
      colitis in humans are lacking. To address this, we plan to conduct a pilot clinical trial (60&#xD;
      adult male and female participants) that will obtain preliminary data about the effectiveness&#xD;
      of melatonin supplementation as a treatment for ulcerative colitis in adult men and women&#xD;
      with the disease.&#xD;

      Problem of Interest:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatments for ulcerative colitis are not always effective, and often have serious&#xD;
      side effects. Therefore, there is considerable interest in finding alternative treatments for&#xD;
      this disease. Physiologic data suggest that melatonin is important in gastrointestinal (GI)&#xD;
      tract physiology and health, and data from in vitro studies, animal experiments, and some&#xD;
      studies in humans suggest that supplemental melatonin may have an ameliorative effect on&#xD;
      colitis. However, experimental data on the ability of melatonin to improve ulcerative colitis&#xD;
      in humans are lacking. The long-term goal of this proposal is to examine whether melatonin&#xD;
      supplementation helps alleviate mild-to-moderate colitis symptoms. To this end, we plan to&#xD;
      conduct a pilot randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (n = 60) that will obtain&#xD;
      preliminary data about the effectiveness of melatonin supplementation as a treatment for&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis in adult men and women with mild to moderate flare-up of the disease. The&#xD;
      specific aims of the trial are: (i) to estimate the effect of 12 weeks of 5 mg/day&#xD;
      supplementation with melatonin on ulcerative colitis remission, (ii) to estimate the effects&#xD;
      of melatonin supplementation on tissue levels of cytokines and other markers of inflammation,&#xD;
      (iii) to determine whether melatonin's effects vary according to baseline (endogenous)&#xD;
      melatonin levels, (iv) to determine the feasibility of recruiting and retaining a sufficient&#xD;
      number of ulcerative colitis patients for a larger, more definitive study, and (v) to&#xD;
      determine whether melatonin supplementation has any adverse side-effects when taken daily for&#xD;
      12 weeks in adults with ulcerative colitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How the Problem Will Be Studied:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall study design of this trial is that of a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled clinical trial. Patients will be recruited from those seeing their IBD&#xD;
      clinicians at one of three study sites: Emory University, Atlanta Gastroenterology&#xD;
      Associates, or the Atlanta VA Medical Center. Eligibility will be based first on the severity&#xD;
      of disease, determined by physician exam, and through sigmoidoscopy (as part of the Mayo&#xD;
      Scoring System). The Project Coordinator will meet with patients to further determine&#xD;
      eligibility, as there are restrictions based on age, medical history, medications taken,&#xD;
      pregnancy, and others. Willing patients who are otherwise eligible at that point will undergo&#xD;
      a one-week placebo run-in to assess compliance and any reported side-effects. Eligible&#xD;
      patients will undergo their first study sigmoidoscopy, will provide biological samples for&#xD;
      processing (blood, urine, and rectal biopsy tissue), and will be randomized into treatment (5&#xD;
      mg/d at bedtime) or placebo (also at bedtime). They will be given sleep logs and symptoms&#xD;
      logs to fill out weekly during the trial, and they will fill out a colitis-related quality of&#xD;
      life questionnaire. They will be called once per week by the Project Coordinator to check on&#xD;
      the study participants, to assess compliance and side-effects, and to answer any questions.&#xD;
      There will be a clinical visit two weeks after randomization, to assess symptoms and any side&#xD;
      effects. The next scheduled clinical visit is at the end of the trial, where another&#xD;
      sigmoidoscopy and sample collection will take place. Any other interim clinical visit will be&#xD;
      at the discretion of the patients and his or her study physician. Lastly, patients will&#xD;
      complete a questionnaire about colitis-related quality of life during the trial and will be&#xD;
      asked as to whether they suspected which treatment arm they were in. The following period&#xD;
      will be devoted to data analysis, publication of study results, and closeout. Please see&#xD;
      attached protocol for details.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research will have both public health and scientific importance. Ulcerative&#xD;
      colitis is not a rare condition, and sufferers often deal with debilitating symptoms. Thus, a&#xD;
      greater understanding of ways of treat ulcerative colitis would be of potential relevance to&#xD;
      a great number of people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How the Research Will Advance Scientific Knowledge and/or Human Health&#xD;
&#xD;
      UC is a common gastrointestinal disorder in adults, one that can have debilitating symptoms&#xD;
      and severe health consequences. Current treatments are not always effective, and often have&#xD;
      serious side effects. Therefore, there is considerable interest in finding alternative&#xD;
      treatments for this disease. Physiologic data suggest that melatonin is important in GI tract&#xD;
      physiology and health, and data from in vitro studies, animal experiments, and some studies&#xD;
      in humans, suggest that supplemental melatonin may have an ameliorative effect on colitis.&#xD;
      Given our newly-funded pilot clinical trial was awarded the maximum funding available from&#xD;
      the Broad Foundation, with no funds allocated to explore potentially important biological&#xD;
      mechanisms, we feel that this is an excellent opportunity to validate potential clinical&#xD;
      benefits of melatonin as an adjunctive therapy for UC in humans, with mechanistic insights&#xD;
      into the various levels of the inflammatory process that may be influenced by melatonin in&#xD;
      vivo. Thus, the proposed study is a) innovative, b) supported by experimental data, and c)&#xD;
      may ultimately lead to improved treatment of UC based on clinical and mechanistic knowledge&#xD;
      gained through this study conducted in human patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there has been no formal clinical trial of melatonin therapy for UC in humans, and&#xD;
      there have been few mechanistic investigations into the potential mode of action of this&#xD;
      compound on the pathomechanisms identified thus far. Given the very low toxicity documented&#xD;
      for even high levels of melatonin in animals and human subjects, this relatively inexpensive&#xD;
      treatment may represent an attractive alternative for patient suffering from mild to&#xD;
      mid-grade UC given the low incidence of side effects.&#xD;
