    <textblock>
      A Phase II, multi-center, open-label, single-arm study in up to 42 subjects with first&#xD;
      recurrence or progression of GBM at up to 12 sites in Australia, Europe, Israel, and the&#xD;
      United States. Subjects will receive intratumoral infusion of PRX321 administered via&#xD;
      convection-enhanced delivery (CED) at a concentration of 1.5 μg/mL and a total volume of 60&#xD;
      mL over 2 to 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the efficacy (expressed as overall survival at 6 months [OS-6]) of intratumoral&#xD;
      infusion of PRX321 in subjects with first recurrence or progression of glioblastoma&#xD;
      multiforme (GBM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the safety of intratumoral infusion with PRX321 in subjects with recurrent or&#xD;
      progressive GBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DR), overall survival (OS),&#xD;
      and progression-free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the relationship of observed infusate distribution with clinical and radiological&#xD;
      responses.&#xD;
