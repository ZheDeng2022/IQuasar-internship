  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aggressive behavior, both in the form of violence toward others (injury-inflicting or&#xD;
      homicide) or toward oneself (suicide or self-injures) create problems of patient management,&#xD;
      treatment and paroles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological causes of violent crime were hypothesized by Eysenck (1978), who believed that&#xD;
      criminality resulted from a nervous system distinct from that of most people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prefrontal cortex, regulates planning of motor acts and executive functions, which are&#xD;
      critical for inhibitory ability and control of impulsive outburst were found to be impaired&#xD;
      in violent subjects (Hoaken et al, 2003; Blair, 2001; Brower and Price, 2001; Filley et al,&#xD;
      2001; Raine et al, 2000; George et al, 2004; Dolan and Park, 2002; Stevens et al, 2003; Raine&#xD;
      and Yang, 2006), especially in impulsive offenders murderers (Raine et al, 1997; 1998).&#xD;
      Violence act influenced by nonplaning outboards definite as impulsive aggression (Linnoila&#xD;
      and Charney, 1999), which one of the most important factor influenced by dangerous behavior&#xD;
      in general (for review: Skodol, 1998, Moeller et al, 2001; Pontius, 2000; 2004; Siever,&#xD;
      2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cholesterol and fats have many roles and may influence brain function and behavior through&#xD;
      modification of membranes; myelin; enzyme function; absorption and transport of fat-soluble&#xD;
      vitamins and toxins; and steroid hormones and through effects on production, reuptake, or&#xD;
      metabolism of neurotransmitters (Boston et al, 1996).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 80-th a strong association was found between low cholesterol levels and violent&#xD;
      behavior, an association that was not due to age, race, sex, or diagnosis (Mufti et al, 1998;&#xD;
      New et al, 1999; Alvarez et al, 2000; Golomb et al, 2000; Hillbrand et al, 2000; Troisi and&#xD;
      D'Argenio, 2006; Chakrabarat and Sinha, 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Associations between violent behavior, cognitive functioning and total cholesterol level were&#xD;
      contradicted with difference in samples and behavioral parameters: homicide, homicide&#xD;
      attempts, rape, physical or verbal aggression, complete suicide or suicide attempts, only&#xD;
      partially accounted for each measure of behaviors, suggesting that further investigation is&#xD;
      warranted. Because of the inconsistencies in the available data, we studied retrospectively a&#xD;
      group of criminal offenders with alcohol and drug use. Our analysis of lipid constituents in&#xD;
      serum focused on TC, HDL, LDL, and TG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance of the study. It is possible that cholesterol profile is a biomarker and&#xD;
      potential predictor of violent in patients with polydrug use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this retrospective study is to investigate the correlations between&#xD;
      cholesterol and cognitive profiles in psychiatric patients with violent behaviour. The&#xD;
      demographic and criminal records, clinical characteristics, cholesterol profiles, and&#xD;
      cognitive performance data of these patients will be will be intercorrelated.&#xD;
