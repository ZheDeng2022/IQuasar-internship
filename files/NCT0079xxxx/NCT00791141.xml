      This multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled phase II trial evaluates safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      post-operative chemoradiation in combination with cetuximab in squamous cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
      head and neck.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck still has a poor prognosis and&#xD;
      loco-regional recurrence frequently occurs. Efforts have been made to improve response rates&#xD;
      and survival and different therapeutic regimens including concurrent chemo-radiotherapy or&#xD;
      sequential chemo-radiotherapy have been developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further increase the outcome of patients with locally advanced SCCHN effective new&#xD;
      treatments with minimal toxicities are needed. Molecular targeted agents, which do not&#xD;
      demonstrate overlapping toxicities with commonly used chemotherapy agents, have therefore&#xD;
      been investigated. The EGFR is widely expressed at high levels in SSCHN and is associated&#xD;
      with poor prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cetuximab has already been investigated in combination with radiotherapy or chemotherapy in&#xD;
      patients with head and neck cancer. The immunoradiotherapy was well tolerated with most of&#xD;
      the side effects related to the high dose irradiation. The most common side effects are&#xD;
      mucositis and dysphagia. Additionally, skin reactions appear sometimes more frequently in&#xD;
      cetuximab administration. Grade 3 to 4 infusion reactions were observed in 3% of the patients&#xD;
      treated with cetuximab. Based on the current promising results with RCT in patients with&#xD;
      locally advanced head and neck cancer and clinical results with EGFR-antibodies plus RT, the&#xD;
      present study was primarily designed to define the acute grade 3/4 toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect to show effective results in reducing the risk of distant metastasis, with&#xD;
      administration of an additional six month adjuvant cetuximab treatment, in patient with&#xD;
      recurrent SCCHN.&#xD;
