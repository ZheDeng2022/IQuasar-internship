    <textblock>
      Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a progressive enlargement of the aorta, the largest blood&#xD;
      vessel in the body. It is at risk of bursting when it is usually fatal. Currently the risk of&#xD;
      the AAA bursting is estimated from its diameter. In this study, the investigators hope to&#xD;
      develop a new type of aneurysm scan involving Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). It is hoped&#xD;
      that this scan will be better at determining which AAAs are at risk of bursting and therefore&#xD;
      require an operation to prevent this.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) have a prevalence of ~5% and when ruptured carry a mortality&#xD;
      rate of ~90%. The pathophysiology of AAA encompasses a range of poorly understood&#xD;
      biomechanical and biological processes. Currently the diameter of the aneurysm is used as a&#xD;
      surrogate for the risk of rupture and patients with an aneurysm diameter greater than 55 mm&#xD;
      are considered for elective surgical repair. However, this reliance on a single surrogate&#xD;
      measure is too simplistic and does not take into account other physical and biological&#xD;
      aspects of the AAA. We propose to evaluate the role of inflammation, proteolysis and&#xD;
      neovascularisation in patients with AAA disease. We will compare novel magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging techniques with blood and tissue measures of inflammation (c-reactive protein,&#xD;
      cytokines, macrophage and leucocyte density), proteolytic activity (matrix&#xD;
      metalloproteinases, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases) and neovascularisation (vessel&#xD;
      density, endothelial progenitor cells). By comparing findings between patients with&#xD;
      symptomatic and asymptomatic disease, this study will inform our understanding of the disease&#xD;
      process as well as potentially identify risk markers of AAA instability that could be used to&#xD;
      follow-up patients with asymptomatic disease.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AAA measuring &gt;40mm in AP diameter on ultrasound scanning&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;40 years (patients younger than this with AAA may have a connective tissue&#xD;
             disorder and a different aetiology to their disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Considered to be suitable for standard infra-renal open surgical repair&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are not deemed to be fit for open surgical repair&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are deemed to be suitable for a stent graft performed by the radiologists&#xD;
             rather than the standard operation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindication to MRI scanning identified from MRI Safety Questionnaire (see&#xD;
             attached)or claustrophobia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &lt;40 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients requiring emergent repair such that there is insufficient time available to&#xD;
             complete the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients refusing to give consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients unable to give consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women (contrast is teratogenic in animals)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intercurrent illness (may confound the results)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a systemic inflammatory disorder or underlying malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who require an emergency operation such that there is insufficient time to&#xD;
             complete the study protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Renal dysfunction (Creat &gt;250 or eGFR&lt;25)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hepatic dysfunction (Child's grade B or C)&#xD;
