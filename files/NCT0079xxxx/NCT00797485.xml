      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different&#xD;
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and&#xD;
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing. Giving bevacizumab together with combination chemotherapy may kill more&#xD;
      tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase III trial is studying how well giving induction therapy with bevacizumab&#xD;
      together with combination chemotherapy with or without capecitabine followed by bevacizumab&#xD;
      maintenance therapy in treating patients with metastatic colorectal cancer that cannot be&#xD;
      removed by surgery.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare two strategies of induction bio-chemotherapy followed by the same maintenance&#xD;
           biotherapy in terms of time to failure in patients with previously untreated metastatic&#xD;
           colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the two arms of treatment in terms of response rate, duration of responses,&#xD;
           progression-free survival, safety, and quality of life of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to treatment center,&#xD;
      performance status (0 vs 1), and number of metastatic sites (1 vs ≥ 2). Patients are&#xD;
      randomized to 1 of 2 induction therapy arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I: Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Patients also&#xD;
           receive FOLFIRI chemotherapy comprising irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 1 hour and&#xD;
           leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1 and fluorouracil IV continuously over 46&#xD;
           hours on days 1 and 2. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for up to 12 courses in the&#xD;
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: Patients receive bevacizumab and FOLFIRI chemotherapy (B-FOLFIRI) as in arm I.&#xD;
           Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
           progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90&#xD;
           minutes on day 1 and oral capecitabine once every 12 hours on days 1-14. Treatment&#xD;
           repeats every 3 weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
           unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms, patients achieving stable disease after completion of 6 months of induction&#xD;
      therapy proceed to maintenance therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maintenance therapy: Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes every 3 weeks&#xD;
           for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During or after completion of maintenance therapy, patients with tumor regrowth that is not&#xD;
      classified as disease progression from baseline and who achieved partial or complete response&#xD;
      during or after their induction therapy proceed to reinduction therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reinduction therapy: Patients receive B-FOLFIRI as described previously. Quality of life&#xD;
           is assessed at baseline, every 3 months during induction therapy, and at discontinuation&#xD;
           of study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for up to 2 years.&#xD;
