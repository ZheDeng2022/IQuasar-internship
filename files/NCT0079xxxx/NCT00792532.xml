  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gather observational data on an already FDA-approved&#xD;
      implantation technique for deep brain stimulation (DBS) in which the entire surgery is&#xD;
      performed within an MRI scanner (&quot;interventional MRI&quot;, or iMRI). With this surgical&#xD;
      technique, the patient is fully asleep (under general anesthesia) during DBS implantation.&#xD;
      The standard method for the placement of deep brain stimulators does not use MRI during the&#xD;
      actual DBS placement. The standard method involves placement of a rigid frame on the&#xD;
      patient's head, performance of a short MRI scan, transport to the operating room, placement&#xD;
      of the DBS electrodes in the operating room, and return to the MRI suite for another MR to&#xD;
      confirm correct electrode placement. In the standard method, the patient must be awake for&#xD;
      2-4 hours in the operating room to have &quot;brain mapping&quot; performed, where the brain target is&#xD;
      confirmed by passing &quot;microelectrodes&quot; (thin wires) into the brain to record its electrical&#xD;
      activity. In the standard method, general anesthesia is not required. With the iMRI&#xD;
      technique, the surgery is guided entirely by MRI images performed multiple times as the DBS&#xD;
      electrode is advanced. This eliminates the need for the patient to be awake, and eliminates&#xD;
      the need for passing microelectrodes into the brain before placing the permanent DBS&#xD;
      electrode.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an increasingly common surgical technique for the treatment&#xD;
      of Parkinson's disease and dystonia. The current technical approach to DBS implantation&#xD;
      involves frame-based stereotaxy. In this method, a stereotactic frame is rigidly fixed to the&#xD;
      patient's skull, an MRI is obtained, an anatomic target is identified, and the coordinates of&#xD;
      the target in stereotactic space are calculated. Instruments are mounted on the stereotactic&#xD;
      frame that point to the calculated coordinate. However, due to the inherent inaccuracies in&#xD;
      standard frame-based stereotaxy, a complex 6-hour procedure then ensues to &quot;map&quot; the brain&#xD;
      target with microelectrodes, place the lead, and return to the MR unit to confirm proper&#xD;
      placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this project is to gather observational data on the iMRI DBS implantation&#xD;
      technique and clinical outcomes. This already FDA-approved implantation technique for DBS&#xD;
      will take place entirely within the Phillips 1.5T and a Siemens 3T open magnet MRI machine.&#xD;
      Prior to study initiation, instrumentation and MR protocols were tested using a phantom head.&#xD;
      In the proposed project, subthalamic nucleus or globus pallidus DBS implantations will be&#xD;
      performed bilaterally in patients with Parkinson's disease or dystonia. Patients will be&#xD;
      under general anesthesia. Targeting and lead verification are performed with imaging alone,&#xD;
      without physiologic mapping. Data is to be gathered on the following: operative time, degree&#xD;
      of benefit with bilateral implantation (changes in standard rating scales of motor&#xD;
      disability), DBS voltage requirements, complications), and electrode location by MR. These&#xD;
      measures will be compared with our historical controls, previously entered into our research&#xD;
      database, in which electrodes were placed by the standard methods. We expect that the use of&#xD;
      near real time MR will improve the speed and accuracy of DBS implantation, and eliminate the&#xD;
      need for invasive physiological monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the study participants will be getting iMRI DBS implantation as a part of their&#xD;
      standard of care and agree to have additional study data collected&#xD;
