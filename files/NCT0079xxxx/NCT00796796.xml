      To determine the maximum tolerated dose of the drug temsirolimus given with radiation therapy&#xD;
      for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Temsirolimus has demonstrated anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic activity in multiple&#xD;
      epithelial cancers, is well-tolerated, has non-overlapping toxicities with radiation, and has&#xD;
      been shown to potentiate the effects of radiation in vitro. Locally advanced non-small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer is cured in a minority of patients with concurrent chemoradiation but newer&#xD;
      agents are needed. In this study temsirolimus will be studied in combination with radiation&#xD;
      in a phase I setting to establish safety.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have an indication for thoracic radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because all patients will be receiving radiation therapy to a thoracic mass, they must&#xD;
             have radiographically measurable disease to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be candidates for definitive chemoradiation with curative intent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment of lung cancer (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery) are&#xD;
             allowed if completed at least 4 weeks prior and if all treatment related toxicities&#xD;
             are resolved.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of &gt; 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  leukocytes ≥3,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  platelets ≥100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin &lt; 1.5&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine within normal institutional limits OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above&#xD;
                  institutional normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of temsirolimus on the developing human fetus at the recommended&#xD;
             therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and&#xD;
             men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth&#xD;
             control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation.&#xD;
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this&#xD;
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had prior treatment with temsirolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with symptomatic brain metastases. Known brain metastases are allowed if&#xD;
             asymptomatic and previously treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs; e.g.,&#xD;
             phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) nor any other CYP3A4 inducer such as rifampin&#xD;
             or St. John's wort, as these may decrease temsirolimus levels. A partial list of&#xD;
             agents which interact with cytochrome P450 (CYP3A) is found in Appendix B. Use of&#xD;
             agents that potently inhibit CYP3A (and hence may raise temsirolimus levels), such as&#xD;
             ketoconazole, is discouraged, but not specifically prohibited. Temsirolimus can&#xD;
             inhibit CYP2D6, and may decrease metabolism (and increase drug levels) of drugs that&#xD;
             are substrates for CYP2D6, such as codeine. The appropriateness of use of such agents&#xD;
             is left to physician discretion. A list of drugs that may have potential interactions&#xD;
             with CYP2D6 is found in Appendix B. If there is any doubt about eligibility based on&#xD;
             concomitant medication, the Principal Investigator should be contacted. All&#xD;
             concomitant medications must be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity reactions to macrolide antibiotics (such as&#xD;
             erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible&#xD;
             because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions. In addition, these patients&#xD;
             are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive&#xD;
             therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination&#xD;
             antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients having received prior thoracic radiation therapy directed to the tumor volume&#xD;
             to be treated with radiotherapy on this protocol.&#xD;
