      This is a Phase II Randomized, Open Label, Non-comparative Trial (Parallel Assignment and&#xD;
      Efficacy Study) for patients with HER-2 Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer Previously Treated&#xD;
      With chemotherapy in the Neo-Adjuvant or Adjuvant Setting.Patients will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive Ixabepilone either every three weeks, or weekly for three weeks followed by one week&#xD;
      off. Patients will be treated until consent withdrawal, intolerable toxicity or documented&#xD;
      disease progression&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with measurable metastatic breast cancer that have been treated in the adjuvant or&#xD;
      neo-adjuvant setting with chemotherapy will be considered for this study. Subjects must not&#xD;
      have received cytotoxic chemotherapy for locally recurrent/metastatic disease. Patients who&#xD;
      fulfil the eligibility criteria, and have signed inform consent for the trial will be&#xD;
      centrally randomized by electronic means to one of two ixabepilone treatment arms.&#xD;
      Stratification factors will include: time to recurrence from adjuvant treatment, calculated&#xD;
      from the date of the last dose of adjuvant treatment to the date of relapse (≤ 1 year vs. &gt; 1&#xD;
      year); and previous chemotherapy with taxane regimen in the neo-adjuvant or adjuvant setting&#xD;
      (yes vs. no). Randomization will be balanced by site.Treatment Protocol· Arm A [standard once&#xD;
      every three weeks schedule]:Ixabepilone [BMS-247550] will be administered on Day 1 (D1) every&#xD;
      three weeks as a 3-hour infusion at a dose of 40 mg/m2. · Arm B [weekly schedule]:Ixabepilone&#xD;
      [BMS-247550] will be administered weekly for three weeks as a 3-hour infusion at a dose of 20&#xD;
      mg/m2, followed by one week-off.Treatment can be continued until consent withdrawal by the&#xD;
      patient, intolerable toxicity or documented disease progression.&#xD;
