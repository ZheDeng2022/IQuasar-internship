      The hypothesis is that Aastrom TRC autologous bone marrow tissue &quot;grafts&quot; can be safely used&#xD;
      to promote bone healing as part of a single level posterolateral spine fusion surgical&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adults, 18-75 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Identified as eligible for elective surgery for single (1) level, posterolateral&#xD;
             spinal fusion between L1 and S1 in which the spine stabilization is accomplished by&#xD;
             pedicle screws and rod.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male patients and female patients (not pregnant or lactating). Patients should use an&#xD;
             appropriate form of contraception while participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients able to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal organ and marrow function&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with hypophosphatasia, primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism caused by&#xD;
             chronic renal insufficiency or osteomalacia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a prior spinal fusion at the level to be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant use of BMP, or devices containing BMP, or electronic growth stimulators.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any active infection of any clinical significance will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive for HIV, HTLV and/or syphilis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C infection at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergies to protein products (horse or bovine serum, or porcine trypsin) used&#xD;
             in the ex-vivo cell production process.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who require systemic corticosteroid therapy after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or lactation; positive of hCG.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 40 Kg/m2 or greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients unable to tolerate general anesthesia defined as an ASA criteria of &gt;2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (HbA1C &gt;7%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Rationale for Exclusion of Certain Study Candidates&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patients with other diseases are excluded to avoid confounding factors that might&#xD;
                  impact evaluation of safety and efficacy of TRC cell therapy in posterolateral&#xD;
                  spine fusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. More extensive surgery requiring more than one (1) level fusion is&#xD;
                  contraindicated in this study, to avoid confounding factors that might impact&#xD;
                  evaluation of safety and efficacy of TRC cell therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the opinion of the investigator, the patient is unsuitable to cellular therapy or&#xD;
             unable to continue with this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients that drink more than 2 alcoholic drinks per day or have a history of illicit&#xD;
             drug use at the time of enrollment shall not be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient known to be non-euthyroid at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients undergoing active cancer therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bisphosphonate Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patients that have undergone bisphosphonate therapy within the last 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Initiation of bisphosphonate therapy in patients during this study is prohibited.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a known diagnosis of osteoporosis with recorded BMD less than -2.5.&#xD;
