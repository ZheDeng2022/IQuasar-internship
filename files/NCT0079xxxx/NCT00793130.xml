    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to reduce the severity and duration of acute attacks, to prevent the&#xD;
      recurrence of new acute attacks and to improve patient's quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coltect contains anti inflammatory and antioxidant natural agents (curcumin, green tea and&#xD;
      selenomethionine) which are associated with a positive effect on inflammatory disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators assume that Coltect represents a tolerable and mild treatment, viable&#xD;
      alternative to other medical therapies with fewer side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coltect is a food supplement that contains active ingredients from herbal sources.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies in animal models of colitis and in humans with IBD demonstrated that the components&#xD;
      of Coltect have anti-inflammatory effects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hanai H. et al demonstrated that curcumin was safe and effective in maintaining remission in&#xD;
      patients with quiescent UC. (7)&#xD;
&#xD;
      B.Salh et al showed that curcumin, was able to attenuate colitis in the dinitrobenzene&#xD;
      sulfonic acid (DNB)-induced murine model of colitis. The immunohistochemical signal is&#xD;
      dramatically attenuated at the level of the mucosa by curcumin. The authors thus proposed&#xD;
      that curcumin may have therapeutic implications for human IBD. (8)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Benefits of Coltect- Coltect might be suited for the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      mild to moderate flare-ups of ulcerative colitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coltect provides an effect with expected low incidence of side effects. (each agent tested&#xD;
      before and found safe for human use).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The availability of a safe and effective non-surgical and non steroids treatment of active&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview - Clinical indication and summary of existing preclinical and clinical knowledge&#xD;
      pertaining to the product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coltect contains natural compounds: curcumin, green tea and selenium which are approved as&#xD;
      food supplements by the Ministry of Health in Israel. Curcumin and green tea are widely used&#xD;
      in the food industry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Curcumin is a natural compound found in the plant Curcuma longa which is used as a food&#xD;
      additive known as turmeric. The major pigment in turmeric is curcumin - chemical name&#xD;
      diferuloymethane, which possesses both anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Curcumin&#xD;
      also strongly inhibits proliferation of HT-29 and HCT-15 human colon cancer cell lines (1).&#xD;
      Dietary administration of curcumin suppresses the development of chemically induced&#xD;
      cancers(1). These properties have led to studies on the chemopreventive effects of curcumin&#xD;
      which also showed that the agent reduces colonic inflammatory responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Curcumin has a profound immunosuppressive effect via inhibition of IL-2 synthesis as well as&#xD;
      IL-2 and mitogen activation of human leukocytes. This immunosuppressive effect may be&#xD;
      mediated by NFκB inhibition (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the aforementioned, curcumin appears to reduce the inflammatory response in&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis patients Clinical studies with curcumin have shown beneficial effects in&#xD;
      experimental studies of acute and chronic diseases characterized by an exaggerated&#xD;
      inflammatory reaction. There is an ample evidence to support its clinical use both in the&#xD;
      prevention and a treatment setting. Several natural substances such as curcumin have greater&#xD;
      antioxidant effects than conventional vitamins, including various polyphenols, flavonoids and&#xD;
      curcumenoids. Natural substances are worth further research both experimentally and&#xD;
      clinically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sting et al found that: Curcumin was shown to be non-toxic, to have antioxidant activity, and&#xD;
      to inhibit such mediators of inflammation such as NFkB, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2),&#xD;
      lipooxygenase (LOX), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). (13)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ricky A. Sharma et al designed a dose-escalation study to explore the pharmacology of&#xD;
      curcumin in humans. Patients with advanced colorectal cancer consumed capsules compatible&#xD;
      with curcumin doses between 0.45 and 3.6gr. daily for up to 4 months. Curcumin was well&#xD;
      tolerated at all of the dose levels, and dose-limiting toxicity was not observed. At dose of&#xD;
      3.6gr. mild diarrhea is only discernible toxicity. (2) Cheng et al. treated patients with&#xD;
      pre-malignant conditions with tablets containing pure curcumin for up to 3 months at daily&#xD;
      dose as high as 8gr. without evident toxicity . They recommended that the common therapeutic&#xD;
      dose would be 400-600 mg curcumin 3 times daily.(14)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ricky el al showed that consumption of 3.6 g of curcumin daily causes inhibition of PGE2&#xD;
      production by blood leukocytes measured ex vivo.(2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In therapy for UC, a double blind placebo-controlled trial with curcumin found that both the&#xD;
      clinical and endoscopic evaluation scores were significantly improved by curcumin therapy.&#xD;
      The endoscopic score was substantially improved compared with the placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study indicate that the turmeric component, curcumin, is potentially a&#xD;
      promising medication for the treatment of IBD (7)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Green tea is made from unfermented, solely leaves of Camellia sinensis and contains the&#xD;
      highest concentration of powerful antioxidants called polyphenols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The green tea polyphenols include (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), (-) epigallocatechin&#xD;
      (EGC), (-)-epicatechin gallate (ECG) and (-)-epicatechin (EC), they have potent antioxidant&#xD;
      properties. (9) Gary et al provide evidence that green tea polyphenols have anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      effects in murine colitis. They showed that mice treated with green tea polyphenols have less&#xD;
      severe colitis, and green tea polyphenols are widely distributed throughout the body, one of&#xD;
      the highest tissue concentrations is found in the intestine. This distribution favors its use&#xD;
      in gastrointestinal diseases such as IBD.(9)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selenium is an essential trace element with a worldwide average nutritional intake of 50 to&#xD;
      350 µg/d function as an antioxidant and anti inflammatory and associated with colorectal&#xD;
      cancer prevention.(10,11) Marwan et al established the safety of administering high dose&#xD;
      (2200 µg) of selenomethionine in humans with cancer up to 13 months. (12) Toxicity at high&#xD;
      dose selenium appeared as mild headache, nausea or heartburn.&#xD;
