  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is an autoimmune disease in which the insulin-producing&#xD;
      pancreatic beta cells are destroyed, resulting in poor blood sugar control. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of low molecular weight sulfated dextran&#xD;
      (LMW-SD) on post-transplant islet function in people with T1D who have responded to intensive&#xD;
      insulin therapy and have received kidney transplants. This study is taking place in Uppsala&#xD;
      and Stockholm, Sweden, and Oslo, Norway.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      T1D is commonly treated with the administration of insulin, either by multiple insulin&#xD;
      injections or by a continuous supply of insulin through a wearable pump. Insulin therapy&#xD;
      allows long-term survival in individuals with T1D; however, it does not guarantee constant&#xD;
      normal blood sugar control. Because of this, long-term type 1 diabetic survivors often&#xD;
      develop vascular complications, such as diabetic retinopathy, an eye disease that can cause&#xD;
      poor vision and blindness, and diabetic nephropathy, a kidney disease that can lead to kidney&#xD;
      failure and thus kidney transplant. Some individuals with T1D develop hypoglycemia&#xD;
      unawareness, a life-threatening condition that is not easily treatable with medication and is&#xD;
      characterized by reduced or absent warning signals for hypoglycemia. For such individuals,&#xD;
      pancreas or pancreatic islet transplantation are possible treatment options. Rejection of&#xD;
      these islets by the recipient's immune system, however, can make the treatment ineffective.&#xD;
      An immune response known as instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR) results in&#xD;
      the disruption of islet integrity and islet loss within an hour of transplantation. LMW-SD&#xD;
      inhibits IBMIR by preventing the cascade that triggers it, when combined with pancreatic&#xD;
      islets. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of LMW-SD improving&#xD;
      the outcome of islet transplantation by preventing IBMIR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a preparation of islets becomes available, participants will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      either the low molecular weight sulfated dextran (LMW-SD) Arm or to the Control&#xD;
      Group/Standard of Care Arm. Participants in the LMW-SD Arm will receive LMW-SD before, with&#xD;
      and for 5 hours after islet transplantation. Participants in the Control Group will receive&#xD;
      heparin with the islet transplantation. All participants will also receive the oral&#xD;
      medications, mycophenolate mofetil or sirolimus and tacrolimus or cyclosporine throughout the&#xD;
      study. In addition, they will receive either intravenous daclizumab on the day of islet&#xD;
      transplantation and at Week 2, 4, 6, and 8 or intravenous basiliximab on the day of islet&#xD;
      transplantation and on Day 4. The islet transplantation will occur at the hospital and will&#xD;
      be given via the portal vein. All participants will be eligible to receive second and third&#xD;
      islet transplantation(s) if previous transplants fail. After each islet transplantation,&#xD;
      study visits will occur on Days 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 75, and Months 6 and 12. At these&#xD;
      visits, physical exams and blood collection will occur. At some visits urine collection will&#xD;
      also occur.&#xD;
