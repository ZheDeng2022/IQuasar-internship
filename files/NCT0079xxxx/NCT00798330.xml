  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are preparing to receive chemotherapy are asked to have their teeth cleaned&#xD;
      before starting treatment as standard of care. This research study is being done to see if&#xD;
      having dental cleaning increases the chances of bacteria from the mouth getting into the&#xD;
      blood stream. It is also being done to see if these bacteria can cause blood stream&#xD;
      infections in people who have a Central Venous Catheter (CVC),often called a &quot;port&quot; or a&#xD;
      &quot;PICC&quot;, placed for giving chemotherapy. It is a well-established fact that we introduce&#xD;
      bacteria from the mouth into the bloodstream with activities of daily life including chewing,&#xD;
      flossing and brushing teeth. This introduction of bacteria into the blood stream may cause&#xD;
      bacteria to stick to the central venous catheter and serve as a source of infection when the&#xD;
      immune system is weakened by cancer. The purpose of this research study is to see if we can&#xD;
      find bacteria from mouth in blood that is drawn through the CVC, during, and after a dental&#xD;
      cleaning procedure. This way, we will be able to assess whether or not this is a potential&#xD;
      health risk to cancer patients.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients under the age of 18&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received any antibacterial in the time period starting 48 hours&#xD;
             before the dental cleaning. This includes systemic antibacterials and topical&#xD;
             antibacterials in the oral cavity or at/through the CVC site. (Topical antibacterials&#xD;
             at other sites are allowed; antifungal and antiviral agents in any form are allowed).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who plan to use antibacterials within the 24 hours after the procedure (until&#xD;
             the final blood sample is obtained).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a documented blood stream infection within 1 month prior to proposed&#xD;
             dental cleaning.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a clinically significant coagulation disorder or patients on warfarin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who require antibiotic prophylaxis as per American College of&#xD;
             Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) 2007 guidelines, namely;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients who have had a cardiac transplantation,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  incomplete cardiac valve repair,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  complete cardiac valve repair in last 6 months,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  prior history of infective endocarditis ,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients with a prosthetic cardiac valve.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any other condition which might preclude participation in the opinion of&#xD;
             the patient's physician(s) or the study PI's.&#xD;
