    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is 1) to investigate the single-dose pharmacokinetics of immediate&#xD;
      release (IR) paliperidone, after oral administration, in patients having moderate hepatic&#xD;
      impairment compared to patients having normal hepatic function, 2) to document the plasma&#xD;
      protein binding and disposition of the enantiomers of paliperidone, and 3) to evaluate the&#xD;
      tolerability and safety profile of IR paliperidone in both patient populations.&#xD;

      This is a single-dose, parallel-group, open-label, single-center, Phase 1 study of immediate&#xD;
      release (IR) paliperidone in patients having either normal or moderately-impaired hepatic&#xD;
      function. The groups, which will consist of 10 patients each, will be demographically matched&#xD;
      with respect to age, weight, sex, and ethnicity. The study will consist of a screening period&#xD;
      of up to 3 weeks and an open-label, single-dose treatment period (Days 1 through 5). On Day&#xD;
      1, a single dose of 1 mg Intermediate Release (IR) paliperidone oral solution will be&#xD;
      administered after a fast of at least 10 hours; patients will continue to fast for 4 hours&#xD;
      following study drug administration. The 96-hour follow-up will consist of serial sample&#xD;
      collections of blood and urine for pharmacokinetic analysis and safety and tolerability&#xD;
      assessments. Patients will remain confined to the study site through the 72-hour&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics sampling and will consume standard institutional meals while in the study&#xD;
      site. Patients will be released after the 72-hour sampling, then will return to the study&#xD;
      site on Day 5 before the 96-hour pharmacokinetics sampling; end-of-study procedures will be&#xD;
      performed immediately thereafter. Currently, pharmacokinetic data are available after oral IR&#xD;
      and Extended Release (ER) formulations of paliperidone were administered to healthy patients&#xD;
      and to patients with schizophrenia who had normal hepatic function. No pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      information on paliperidone in patients with hepatic impairment has been obtained. The target&#xD;
      population for paliperidone comprises schizophrenic patients. Because some patients in the&#xD;
      target population might be hepatically impaired, pharmacokinetic information in this&#xD;
      population is helpful. This single-dose pharmacokinetic study will collect information in&#xD;
      patients with normal hepatic function and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment to&#xD;
      provide clinical dosing information/recommendations for patients with hepatic impairment.&#xD;
      Safety and tolerability will be monitored. A single dose of 1 mg intermediate release (IR)&#xD;
      paliperidone oral solution&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with normal hepatic function:Normotensive at screening, with supine (5&#xD;
             minutes) blood pressure between the range of 95 to 160 mmHg systolic, inclusive, and&#xD;
             55 to 95 mmHg diastolic, inclusive, demographically comparable to the hepatic&#xD;
             impairment group with respect to age, weight, sex, and ethnicity and healthy on the&#xD;
             basis of a prestudy physical examination, medical history, ECG, and laboratory results&#xD;
             of blood biochemistry, hematology, and urinalysis performed within 3 weeks before&#xD;
             study drug administration. If the results of the biochemistry or hematology tests or&#xD;
             the urinalysis are not within the laboratory's reference ranges, the patient can be&#xD;
             included only if the investigator judges that the deviations are not clinically&#xD;
             significant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with moderate hepatic impairment: Blood pressure controlled and stable on&#xD;
             antihypertensive agents, stable hepatic disease with laboratory and clinical findings&#xD;
             that support the diagnosis of hepatic impairment, otherwise healthy on the basis of a&#xD;
             prestudy physical examination, medical history, ECG, and laboratory results of blood&#xD;
             biochemistry, hematology, and urinalysis performed within 3 weeks before study drug&#xD;
             administration. Patients with controlled hypertension and those problems directly&#xD;
             associated with the primary diagnosis of hepatic impairment may be included. Patients&#xD;
             with stable, mild, chronic concurrent diseases, such as degenerative joint disease,&#xD;
             Type II diabetes, or thyroid conditions requiring thyroid replacement therapy or&#xD;
             surgery, may be included. If the results of the biochemistry or hematology tests or&#xD;
             the urinalysis are not within the laboratory's references ranges, the patient can be&#xD;
             included only if the investigator judges that the deviations are not clinically&#xD;
             significant. Laboratory results related to the patient's underlying condition may be&#xD;
             outside of the normal ranges. (Serum bilirubin, albumin, and prothrombin time will be&#xD;
             assessed individually)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total score of Child-Pugh's classification will be between 7 and 9, inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant medications to treat underlying disease states or medical conditions&#xD;
             related to hepatic insufficiency are allowed. Patients have to be on a stable dose of&#xD;
             medication and/or treatment regimen 2 months before the study, as well as during the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with normal hepatic function:Has any significant history or presence of&#xD;
             hepatic disease or has positive serology result for hepatitis B surface antigen&#xD;
             (HBsAg) or anti-hepatitis C virus (as determined by a multi-antigen enzyme&#xD;
             immunoassay)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At screening, sustained drops in systolic (&gt;20 mmHg) or diastolic (&gt;10 mmHg) blood&#xD;
             pressure after standing for at least 2 minutes which are not associated with an&#xD;
             increase in pulse rate of &gt;15 beats per minute&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is taking, or has taken, any prescribed or over-the-counter drug (including vitamins&#xD;
             and herbal supplements) within 2 weeks before study drug administration (with the&#xD;
             exception of paracetamol, hormonal contraceptives, and hormone replacement therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with moderate hepatic impairment: Has any clinically significant laboratory&#xD;
             abnormality except those parameters influenced by hepatic impairment, has a score of 3&#xD;
             or 4 for hepatic encephalopathy as determined by the result of the Number Connection&#xD;
             Test, has severe ascites and/or pleural effusion, has serology result positive for&#xD;
             HBsAg, has acute exacerbation of liver disease, as indicated by worsening clinical&#xD;
             signs of hepatic impairment, or by an increase of more than 50% in total bilirubin or&#xD;
             prothrombin time in the preceding 3 months (as far as information is available).&#xD;
