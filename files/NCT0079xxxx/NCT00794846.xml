    <textblock>
      This was a crossover study designed to see if patients with allergy symptoms preferred&#xD;
      Clarinex® or Zyrtec®. Patients were randomized to take 7 days of Clarinex or Zyrtec&#xD;
      treatment, followed by a 5 to 28-day washout period (days when no drug is given), followed by&#xD;
      7 days of the opposite treatment. At the end of each 7-day treatment, patients were asked&#xD;
      questions to determine which drug, Clarinex or Zyrtec, the patient prefers more.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  had any clinically significant deviation from normal in the physical examination that,&#xD;

             affect subject safety;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  had any clinically significant metabolic, cardiovascular, immunologic, neurologic,&#xD;
             hematologic, gastrointestinal, cerebrovascular, or respiratory disease, or any other&#xD;
