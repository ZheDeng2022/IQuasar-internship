      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Human papilloma virus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted disease. There are more&#xD;
           than 100 different HPV types, and both males and females can get HPV infection. Most&#xD;
           people do not have any symptoms when they become infected and are able to get rid of the&#xD;
           infection on their own. However, they can still become re-infected with the same or a&#xD;
           different HPV type, and in some people HPV infection persists.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Persistent HPV infection is associated with the development of precancerous lesions and&#xD;
           cancer. HPV types are classified as either high risk or low risk based on whether their&#xD;
           persistence will lead to cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who have suppressed immune systems are at a higher risk for HPV-related&#xD;
           complications. They are more likely to contract multiple HPV types and have more&#xD;
           persistent infection that can lead to precancerous lesions or cancer, which are then&#xD;
           difficult to treat and often recur.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A recently approved vaccine for HPV induces immunity to HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18. It was&#xD;
           shown to be highly effective in preventing infection with these HPV types, and is&#xD;
           approved for use in females 9 to 26 years of age. However, much less is known about the&#xD;
           vaccine s ability to induce immunity in males or individuals with suppressed immune&#xD;
           systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To investigate whether the HPV vaccine is safe to give and able to induce immunity in both&#xD;
      female and male adolescents and young adults with HIV infection compared to healthy,&#xD;
      HIV-negative persons of the same age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Males and females, 12 to 26 years of age, divided into three groups: (1) Healthy and&#xD;
      HIV-negative, (2) HIV-positive and on antiretroviral therapy, and (3) HIV-positive and not on&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before beginning vaccination, participants will have a complete physical examination and&#xD;
           blood drawn for routine blood tests, special tests of the immune system, antibody tests,&#xD;
           and an HIV test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HPV vaccine will be given by injection into the muscle at 0, 2, and 6 months, according&#xD;
           to the standard vaccination schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with HIV infection will be monitored for a week following the first injection&#xD;
           to test the level of HIV in the blood 3 days and 5 days after the first injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will also be asked to fill out a 10- to 15-minute Web-based survey about&#xD;
           awareness, health behaviors, and personal choices related to risk factors for HIV, HPV,&#xD;
           and other sexually transmitted diseases. Participants are not required to fill out the&#xD;
           survey to receive the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The total duration of the study is 4 years. During the first year of the study,&#xD;
           participants will return for six additional 1-day visits at months 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and&#xD;
           12. Participants will return for 1-day visits every 6 months for the remaining 3 years.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human papilloma virus (HPV) is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases and a&#xD;
      significant cause of cutaneous genital warts and anogenital cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infection with high-risk, oncogenic HPV types, most commonly types 16 and 18, is associated&#xD;
      with low and high-grade cervical cellular abnormalities that are precursors to invasive&#xD;
      cervical cancer, as well as vulvar and anal cancer, while HPV types 6 and 11 are associated&#xD;
      with genital warts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persistence of HPV infection is more common in individuals with or at risk for chronic&#xD;
      immunosuppression and HIV-infected individuals have a higher prevalence of HPV infection and&#xD;
      HPV-associated anogential disease compared to age-matched HIV-negative controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the safety and immunogenicity of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6, 11,&#xD;
      16, 18) recombinant vaccine in HIV-infected preadolescents, adolescents and young adults&#xD;
      12-26 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether there are differences in HPV vaccine immunogenicity between HIV-infected&#xD;
      and HIV negative age-matched controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether there are differences in HPV vaccine immunogenicity between HIV-infected&#xD;
      patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and those not receiving HAART&#xD;
      with similar CD4 and viral load parameters at entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether HPV vaccination alters HIV-1 RNA levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the impact of CD4 count and HIV-1 RNA levels on HPV vaccine immunogenicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To characterize HPV DNA positivity in the study cohort populations through oral/buccal and&#xD;
      anogenital sampling at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To characterize HPV and HIV knowledge and risk and sexual behaviors in the study cohort&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual Cohorts&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: HIV-positive, CD4 cell count greater than or equal to 350 cells/mm3, HIV-1 RNA&#xD;
      level by RT PCR less than or equal to 20,000 copies/ml, on stable HAART regimen for greater&#xD;
      than or equal to 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2: HIV-infected, CD4 cell count greater than or equal to 500 cells/mm3, HIV-1 RNA&#xD;
      level by RT PCR less than or equal to 20,000 copies/ml, on no antiretroviral treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 3: healthy, HIV-negative controls All Cohorts&#xD;
&#xD;
      Females and males age 12 to 26 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must have a hemoglobin greater than or equal to 10.0 gm/dL, neutrophil count (ANC)&#xD;
      greater than or equal to 1500/mm3, platelet count greater than or equal to 75,000/mm3 and PT&#xD;
      or PTT less than or equal to 1.5x ULN (with the exception of patients with known clotting&#xD;
      disorders or lupus anticoagulant); SGPT/SGOT &lt; 2/5x ULN, total bilirubin less than or equal&#xD;
      to 1.5x ULN unless attributable to protease inhibitor therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must test negative for hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus, unless the result is&#xD;
      consistent with prior vaccination or prior infection with full recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No use of investigational agents within 4 weeks of study enrollment or use of&#xD;
      immunosuppressive or immunomodulating agents within 8 weeks of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a non-randomized, prospective, phase I study of quadrivalent human papillomavirus&#xD;
      (types 6, 11, 16, 18) recombinant vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes 3 cohorts of pre-adolescents, adolescents and young adults 12-26 years of&#xD;
      age as outlined under Eligibility Criteria. Each cohort will enroll 35 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study subjects will receive three doses of HPV vaccine at 0, 2 and 6 months administered&#xD;
      IM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be monitored at months 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 12 (+/- 2 weeks for each&#xD;
      visit, and every 6 months (+/- 30 days) thereafter for 48 months total.&#xD;
