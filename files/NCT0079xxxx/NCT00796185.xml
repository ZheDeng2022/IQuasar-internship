      The purpose of this study is to compare the steady-state pharmacokinetics of paliperidone&#xD;
      after oral administration of 15 mg extended-release (ER) OROS paliperidone once daily with&#xD;
      the steady-state pharmacokinetics of paliperidone after oral administration of 8 mg&#xD;
      immediate-release (IR) risperidone twice daily; and to explore the dose-proportionality of 9&#xD;
      mg and 15 mg ER OROS paliperidone. Other objectives are to 1) document the disposition of the&#xD;
      enantiomers of paliperidone; 2) explore the relationship between genotype (CYP2D6, CYP3A4,&#xD;
      CYP3A5, UGT1A1, and UGT1A6) and pharmacokinetic parameters; and 3) assess safety and&#xD;
      tolerability.&#xD;

      This is an open-label, multiple-dose, parallel-group study in patients with schizophrenia or&#xD;
      schizoaffective disorder. The study consists of a screening period (2 weeks maximum); a&#xD;
      1-week run-in or washout (Days 1 to 7) during which patients taking risperidone prestudy and&#xD;
      randomly assigned to paliperidone treatment will receive replacement antipsychotic therapy,&#xD;
      and other patients continue to take their prestudy antipsychotic medication; a 14-day&#xD;
      open-label treatment period (Days 8 to 21); and a 5-day follow-up period. On Day 1 of the&#xD;
      washout period, eligible patients will be randomized to receive ER OROS paliperidone (PAL) or&#xD;
      risperidone (RIS). All patients will receive their first dose of study medication on Day 8&#xD;
      after randomization as follows: Patients randomized to PAL will receive 9 mg of ER OROS&#xD;
      paliperidone daily from Day 8 to Day 14, followed by 15 mg of ER OROS paliperidone q.d. from&#xD;
      Day 15 to Day 21. Patients randomized to RIS will receive dose-escalation up to 7 mg&#xD;
      risperidone twice daily (b.i.d.) from Day 8 to Day 14, followed by 8 mg risperidone b.i.d.&#xD;
      from Day 15 to Day 21. The study medication on Days 14 and 21 in the PAL group and on Day 21&#xD;
      in the RIS group will be administered after completion of a standardized high fat, high&#xD;
      caloric breakfast. Patients will be confined to the testing facility from the morning of Day&#xD;
      8 (or earlier at the discretion of the investigator) until completion of the study procedures&#xD;
      on Day 23. On all other assessment days, patients will return to the testing facility and&#xD;
      remain there for the duration of the assessments.The highest dose of paliperidone currently&#xD;
      being studied is 12 mg given as 6 tablets of 2 mg ER OROS paliperidone. In the currently&#xD;
      proposed study, data on the safety and tolerability of the 15-mg dose will be monitored and&#xD;
      collected. Paliperidone ER oral administration of 9 mg q.d. on Day 8 to 14, and 15 mg daily&#xD;
      on Day 15 to 21; oral administration of escalating doses up to 7 mg risperidone twice daily&#xD;
      (b.i.d.) between Days 8 and 14, inclusive, and 8 mg risperidone b.i.d. on Day 15 to 21&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently treated with a dose of at least 6 mg of risperidone daily or the equivalent&#xD;
             of any other antipsychotic medication or a combination thereof (an equivalence table&#xD;
             will be provided to the sites)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia (295.10, 295.20, 295.30, 295.60, 295.90) or&#xD;
