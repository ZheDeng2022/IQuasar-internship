  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All patients are treated according to the same therapy regimen. Therapy duration (number of&#xD;
      cycles) and radiotherapy vary according to age group, stage and response. Chemotherapy&#xD;
      consists of a pre-phase-treatment (for all patients) and varying A, B and C cycles. Therapy&#xD;
      for Patients in the 18-55 Age Group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients in stages III-IV and all patients with mediastinal tumors or extranodal&#xD;
           involvement are administered 6 cycles (A1, B1, A2, B2, A3, B3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chemotherapy is stopped after 4 cycles (A1, B1, A2, B2) for patients with stage I/ II if&#xD;
           a clear CR has been achieved and there is initially no mediastinal or extranodal&#xD;
           involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In cases of refractory or progressive disease after 4 cycles, study therapy is stopped.&#xD;
           These patients are to be given salvage therapy with subsequent stem cell&#xD;
           transplantation. Therapy for Patients older than 55 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The course corresponds to that of patients in the younger age group, but the regimen is&#xD;
           dose reduced (A1*, B1*,A2*, B2*, A3*, B3*). Antibody therapy with anti-CD20 is to be&#xD;
           administered on day 1 of each chemotherapy cycle (A, B). After end of chemotherapy (6 or&#xD;
           4 cycles) 2 more cycles of anti-CD 20 are to be administered to reach a total number of&#xD;
           8 resp. 6 cycles antibody therapy.&#xD;
