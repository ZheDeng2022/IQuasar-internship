    <textblock>
      The principal objective of the study is to investigate the effect of sorafenib on progression&#xD;
      free survival (time until the cancer begins to grow again,) in patients with malignant&#xD;
      mesothelioma who have had prior treatment with chemotherapy. Effectiveness of the drug will&#xD;
      also be explored with PET scans before and during treatment.&#xD;
