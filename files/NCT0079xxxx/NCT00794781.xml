    <description>E6201 Part A (Dose Escalation): Intravenous (IV) infusion administered over 30 minutes once weekly for 3 weeks (Days 1, 8, and 15). The first 3 to 6 subjects of the first cohort will receive 20 mg/m^2/week for a cycle of 3 weeks followed by a 1-week rest period. Subsequent dose escalations may increase at increments of 100% until two Grade 2 toxicities or 1 dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) are observed in a dose group. Thereafter, doses will be increased in increments of 50% or less until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. Part B (MTD Expansion): After the MTD is determined in Part A, 15 additional subjects will continue to receive cycles at the MTD.</description>

             CT/MRI or photography (as appropriate), and which measures greater than 1.5 cm in the&#xD;
             longest diameter for a non-lymph node and greater than 2.0 cm in the short axis&#xD;

             vasectomised partner. Female subjects who use hormonal contraceptives must also use an&#xD;
             additional approved method of contraception (as described previously). Contraceptive&#xD;
             measures must start either prior to or at Screening and continue throughout the entire&#xD;
             study period and for 2 months after the last dose drug is administered. Pregnant&#xD;

             double-barrier method (e.g., condom and spermicide; condom, diaphragm, and&#xD;
             spermicide). Contraceptive measures must start either prior to or at Screening and&#xD;
             continue throughout the entire study period and for 2 months after the last dose of&#xD;
             study drug is administered.&#xD;
