      The workshop is a 6-week online workshop for caregivers of people with traumatic brain&#xD;
      injury, post traumatic stress disorder, or dementia. It is being conducted jointly by the&#xD;
      Stanford Patient Education Research Center and the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System&#xD;
      and is supported by a grant from the Department of Veterans Affairs, Patient Care Services,&#xD;
      Office of Care Management and Social Work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the study is to determine whether an online caregiver education and support&#xD;
      workshop can have lasting beneficial effects in helping caregivers improve their&#xD;
      self-management of health skills, stress, and improve their caregiving abilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to enroll 120 participants living in California, Hawaii or Southern&#xD;
      Nevada. Your participation in the workshop is expected to last six weeks, and the study will&#xD;
      last 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This workshop is aimed at helping you to better manage your own health and the demands placed&#xD;
      on you because of caregiving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the moderators and other workshop participants, you will discuss:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stress reduction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Goal setting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maintaining your health&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dealing with difficult emotions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Handling difficult behaviors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Better decision making&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Communicating better with health care professionals&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Communicating better with your friends, family and coworkers&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you participate in the workshop, you will take it online with 20-25 other people like you&#xD;
      who are caregivers for veterans with TBI, PTSD, or dementia, or are veterans giving care to&#xD;
      someone with these disorders. Each week you will log on to the study web site at least three&#xD;
      times for a total time per week of about 2 hours. The first time you log on each week should&#xD;
      be on the first or second day of the workshop, but you may log on at any time you find&#xD;
      convenient. You may log on as often as you wish and at any time during the week. There is no&#xD;
      time when all of you must log on at the same time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each week, you will be asked to read material on line, to complete activities on the web&#xD;
      site, to make and share an action plan (for something you choose each week), to share your&#xD;
      caregiving-related problems with others in your group, and most important of all, to help and&#xD;
      support other group members with your experiences and wisdom. You will participate by using&#xD;
      an anonymous screen name, and none of the other workshop members will know your real name.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Everyone in the study will be asked to fill out 4 brief online questionnaires about your&#xD;
      health, medical care, activities and mood. You will fill out one questionnaire now, one two&#xD;
      months after the beginning of the workshop, and another one in six months, and one in one&#xD;
      year. Each questionnaire will take about 30 minutes to complete. Shortly after the workshop,&#xD;
      we may ask you to participate in an email discussion group designed to get your feedback&#xD;
      about the workshop. For the follow up questionnaires at 2, 6 and 12 months after you start&#xD;
      the workshop you will receive a $10 Amazon.com certificate for each questionnaire to&#xD;
      compensate you for your time and effort.&#xD;
