  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is the most common inherited kidney&#xD;
      disease, affecting more than 400,000 people in the U.S. and 5 million people worldwide. PKD&#xD;
      is the 4th most common cause of kidney failure requiring dialysis and/or transplantation.&#xD;
      Over half of all PKD patients develop kidney failure by age 60 years, although age of onset&#xD;
      of kidney disease varies widely, even among members of the same family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the fact this is a relatively common problem, relatively few patients have been&#xD;
      studied for a sufficient period of time to fully understand how patients are affected over&#xD;
      the course of their lifetime. The reason for creating this repository is to collect&#xD;
      information about PKD so that the investigators may fully understand its complications,&#xD;
      including high blood pressure, heart attack, and stroke. This information may also aid in the&#xD;
      development of improved treatment strategies.&#xD;

        All patients enrolled in this study will have the diagnosis of autosomal dominant kidney&#xD;
        disease. The diagnostic criteria for at-risk individuals (i.e., with a first degree family&#xD;
        member with ADPKD) includes the presence of at least two(unilateral or bilateral) renal&#xD;
        cysts, and two cysts in each kidney are considered sufficient for diagnosis in aged 15 to&#xD;
        29 years and in 30 to 59 years, respectively. In families of unknown genotype, the presence&#xD;
        of three or more (unilateral or bilateral) renal cysts is sufficient for establishing the&#xD;
        diagnosis in individuals aged 15 to 39 years, two or more cysts in each kidney is&#xD;
        sufficient for individuals aged 40-59 years and four or more cysts in each kidney is&#xD;
        required in individuals â‰¥60 years of age.&#xD;
