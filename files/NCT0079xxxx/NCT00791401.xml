  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of 3 mg&#xD;
      extended release paliperidone (ER OROSÃ' paliperidone) in patients with varying degrees of&#xD;
      renal impairment (mild, moderate, and severe), compared to patients with normal renal&#xD;
      function. Secondary objectives include the assessing the disposition of the (+) and (-)&#xD;
      enantiomers by means of an enantioselective liquid chromatography mass spectrometry assay, to&#xD;
      determine plasma protein binding of the enantiomers in patients with impaired renal function,&#xD;
      compared with patients with normal renal function, and to evaluate the tolerability and&#xD;
      safety profile of ER OROS paliperidone in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment&#xD;
      (mild, moderate, and severe) compared with patients with normal renal function.&#xD;

      This is a single dose, parallel group, open-label, 2 center pharmacokinetic study, consisting&#xD;
      of a pretreatment (screening) period of between 1 and 3 weeks, an open label treatment period&#xD;
      (single dose of ER OROS paliperidone on Day 1 only, and with end of study procedures and&#xD;
      discharge ending on Day 6). All patients will be screened between Day 21 and Day 1 for renal&#xD;
      function. On Day 1, all patients will receive a single oral dose of 3 mg ER OROS paliperidone&#xD;
      and undergo a 120 hour follow up with serial blood collections for pharmacokinetics, safety&#xD;
      and tolerability assessments. Patients will be discharged after giving a pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      blood sample and completing end of study assessments in the morning of Day 6. Group matching&#xD;
      will be applied to the renal function groups to reduce bias and increase comparability of&#xD;
      age, weight, gender, and ethnicity. This study is aimed to compare the pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      safety profile of ER OROS paliperidone in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment&#xD;
      with that of normal patients. 3 mg oral ER OROS paliperidone&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients: A body mass index (weight [kg]/height (m)²) in the range of 18.0 to 32.0&#xD;
             kg/m², inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with normal renal function: Healthy on the basis of a prestudy physical&#xD;
             examination, medical history, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and blood hematology&#xD;
             and biochemistry tests, and urinalysis carried out within 3 weeks before study drug is&#xD;
             administered. Normal renal function&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age-related normotensive at screening, with supine (5 minutes) blood pressure in the&#xD;
             range of 95 to 160 mmHg systolic, inclusive, and 55 to 95 mmHg diastolic, inclusive,&#xD;
             at screening and before study drug administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Demographically comparable to the groups with renal impairment with respect to age&#xD;
             (±10 years), weight (±20%), gender, and ethnicity&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with impaired renal function: Has a CrCl of &lt;80 mL/min&#xD;
