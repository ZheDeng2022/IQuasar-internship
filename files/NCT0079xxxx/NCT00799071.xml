    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find a dose for a twice daily regimen for posaconazole (PSZ)&#xD;
      as prophylactic treatment in children with CGD, based on the PSZ trough level.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At this moment itraconazole is the drug of first choice in the prophylaxis of fungal&#xD;
      infections in children with CGD. Breakthrough fungal infections while on itra-conazole&#xD;
      prophylaxis are described in literature indicating the need for a drug with a broader&#xD;
      antifungal spectrum. PSZ might provide in this need. PSZ may also have a clinical safety and&#xD;
      tolerability advantage over other antifungal agents. Because PSZ is metabolized through phase&#xD;
      II glucuronidation it is less common to be subject to drug interactions. PSZ is known to be a&#xD;
      CYP3A4 inhibitor, but does not inhibit other CYP enzymes, therefore it may exhibit fewer drug&#xD;
      interactions as compared with other azole antifungal agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of children is still off-label use. No data have been published to date on the&#xD;
      exposure of PSZ in children under the age of 8 or in children with CGD. There is an urgent&#xD;
      need to study the use of PSZ in these young children. Furthermore, the current regimen for&#xD;
      antifungal prophylaxis requires a three times daily administration of PSZ. For this specific&#xD;
      purpose less complex dosing schedules are warranted thus defining the need to examine a twice&#xD;
      daily schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the tolerability and pharmacokinetics are unknown in patients under the age of 8 years and&#xD;
      only limited data are available for age groups 8 to 16 years, we propose a feasibility study&#xD;
      of a twice daily regimen of PSZ prophylaxis in CGD patients. With this information available&#xD;
      we can suggest a dosage for future prophylaxis in this patient group.&#xD;

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has CGD, rendering him/her at risk for invasive fungal infections hence&#xD;
             requiring antifungal prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is at least 2 years of age and younger than 17 years of age on the day of the&#xD;
             first dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parents or legal representative, and children where appropriate, willing and able to&#xD;
             give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is suspected of an invasive fungal infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Therapy with any medicinal product for which an effect on PSZ is expected. If patient&#xD;
             is undergoing therapy with any medicinal product which may be effected by PSZ, the&#xD;
             patient is included on condition that the investigator judges that the effects are not&#xD;
             clinically relevant. This should be clearly recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented history of sensitivity/idiosyncrasy to PSZ.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Results of serum biochemistry and hematology testing are not higher than 3x the upper&#xD;
             limit of normal. If the results exceed these limits, the patient is included on&#xD;
             condition that the investigator judges that the deviations are not clinically&#xD;
             relevant. This should be clearly recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Relevant history or current condition that might interfere with drug absorption,&#xD;
             distribution, metabolism or excretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Relevant history or presence of cardiovascular disorder or renal and hepatic disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of or current abuse of drugs, alcohol or recreational substances.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in a trial with an investigational drug within 60 days prior to the&#xD;
             first dose.&#xD;
