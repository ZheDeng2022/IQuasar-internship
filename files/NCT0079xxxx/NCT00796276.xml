  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetics of paliperidone in plasma&#xD;
      and urine after intravenous (i.v.) administration of the racemate, administration of the&#xD;
      immediate-release (IR) racemate oral solution, administration of the ER OROS tablet, and&#xD;
      administration of the oral solutions of the individual enantiomers R078543 (+) and R078544&#xD;
      (-); to determine the absolute oral bioavailability of IR and ER OROS paliperidone; to&#xD;
      document the (+) and (-) paliperidone enantiomer ratio after i.v. and oral administration (IR&#xD;
      and ER OROS paliperidone); to document the possible interconversion between the (+) and (-)&#xD;
      enantiomers of paliperidone after oral treatment with the separate enantiomers; to document&#xD;
      the possible relationship between the subject's CYP2D6 phenotype and the (+) and (-)&#xD;
      enantiomer disposition of paliperidone (CYP2D6 genotyping was used to corroborate the&#xD;
      phenotype). In addition, the safety and tolerability of all treatments will be evaluated.&#xD;

      This is a single-center, single-dose, open-label, randomized, crossover study in healthy&#xD;
      adults, following a 5-sequence, 5-treatment, 5-period Latin square design. The study consists&#xD;
      of a screening phase (within 21 days before the first administration of study drug), and a&#xD;
      treatment phase consisting of 5 periods during which volunteers will receive a single dose of&#xD;
      study drug under fasting conditions [orally with 240 mL of water or intravenously (i.v.)] in&#xD;
      a random order. Pharmacokinetic blood and urine samples will be collected over a 96-hour&#xD;
      period following study drug administration during each treatment period. Volunteers will be&#xD;
      confined to the testing facility from at least 10 hours before dosing until 72 hours after&#xD;
      dosing in each treatment period and will return for additional assessments. Each&#xD;
      administration of study drug will be separated by a washout period of at least 7 to a maximum&#xD;
      of 14 days. The duration of volunteer participation is maximally 12 weeks, including the 3&#xD;
      week screening period. CYP2D6 metabolizer status will be assessed by phenotyping and will be&#xD;
      corroborated by genotyping of a DNA sample to be collected from volunteers who consent to&#xD;
      this part of the study. Pharmacokinetic data are available after oral administration of&#xD;
      immediate release and extended release formulations of paliperidone. No data are available&#xD;
      after i.v. administration of paliperidone. The data obtained in this study for the i.v. route&#xD;
      are important to further characterize the pharmacokinetics of paliperidone, and for future&#xD;
      population pharmacokinetics modeling of paliperidone. For chiral substances, it is requested&#xD;
      by regulatory authority guidelines to document the disposition of the enantiomers. Therefore,&#xD;
      the disposition of the (+) and (-) enantiomers of paliperidone for different administration&#xD;
      routes (i.v. and oral) and formulations (immediate release and extended release [ER OROS])&#xD;
      will be documented. Separate enantiomers will be administered in this study, as it is&#xD;
      important for the full understanding of the pharmacokinetics of paliperidone to document the&#xD;
      possible chiral interconversion. Safety and tolerability will be monitored throughout the&#xD;
      study. 5 single doses, one each of: Treatment A, 1 mg IR paliperidone oral solution;&#xD;
      Treatment B, 3 mg ER OROS paliperidone oral; Treatment C, 1 mg paliperidone as a 30-min i.v.&#xD;
      infusion; Treatment D, 1 mg (+)-paliperidone (R078543) oral solution; and Treatment E, 1 mg&#xD;
      (-)-paliperidone (R078544) oral solution.&#xD;
