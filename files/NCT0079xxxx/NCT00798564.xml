  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim is to explore pathophysiological factors related to airway&#xD;
      hyperresponsiveness to direct and indirect provocation stimuli in athletes with different&#xD;
      sport activities, with special focus on epithelial reaction linked to CC16 and to eicosanoid&#xD;
      related inflammatory response. The investigators also wish to compare indirect testing done&#xD;
      as hyper osmotic challenge with Mannitol compared to a defined sport specific exercise&#xD;
      challenge.&#xD;

      By non-invasive tools the investigators wish to characterize type of airway reaction to&#xD;
      various provocative stimuli in athletes doing two different sort activities, Tennis or&#xD;
      swimming. As controls are being used sedentary age-matched controls from the same region,&#xD;
      exposed to the same school environment. Thus we wish to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  explore the prevalence of positive mannitol reactivity among swimmers and tennis player&#xD;
           and how this relates to symptoms, disease history and to a sport specific exercise&#xD;
           provocation test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  compare the results from sport specific testing with a standardized eucapnic&#xD;
           hyperventilation test (EHV)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  compare the overall reactivity to mannitol or EHV among swimmers and tennis players&#xD;
           compared to aged matched controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  explore the role by CC16 in airway reactivity to different provocative stimuli and to&#xD;
           see whether there is a difference between different sport activities, different test&#xD;
           protocols and between athletes and controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  explore evidence of eicosanoid related inflammatory reaction in athletes and controls in&#xD;
           relation to different provocative stimuli&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population consists of 100 elite swimmers, 100 elite tennis players and 100&#xD;
      non-elite, eged matched controls. In the latter group, 30 are aged matched non-atopic&#xD;
      non-asthmatic controls.&#xD;
