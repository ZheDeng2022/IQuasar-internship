      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the administration of a dendritic cell&#xD;
      vaccine is a safe and effective treatment for HIV-1 patients. This will be a phase I,&#xD;
      single-center, study in HIV infected patients. The primary objective is to evaluate safety of&#xD;
      the vaccination schedule (from apheresis procedure to week 24) at week 24 and safety of the&#xD;
      Analytical Treatment Interruption (ATI; from week 24 to week 48) at week 48 in HIV-1 infected&#xD;
      patients who have been receiving antiretroviral therapy for at least 12 months with HIV-1 RNA&#xD;
      ≤50 copies/mL and CD4+ T cell counts &gt;500/mm3 at entry in the trial and who received, in&#xD;
      addition to anti-retroviral therapy for 24 weeks, vaccination with ex vivo generated&#xD;
      interferon-alpha dendritic cells loaded with HIV-1 lipopeptides and activated with&#xD;
      lipopolysaccharide (BIIR/ANRS-HIVax-001, the DC vaccine product).&#xD;

    <description>Biological/Vaccine: Experimental: Dendritic Cell Vaccine Patients will receive 4 doses of the vaccine at weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12. The vaccine will be injected subcutaneously, in 3 separate injection sites in the upper and lower extremities.&#xD;
At week 24, patients will have HAART treatment interrupted. The HAART treatment will be resumed at week 48 or earlier at any time point if one of the following occur:&#xD;
two consecutive measurements of CD4+ T cell count below 350x10e6 cells/L and/or 25% of total lymphocytes within at least a 2 weeks&#xD;
an opportunistic infection&#xD;
a CDC class C-defining event (defined in appendix 2)&#xD;
a serious non-AIDS defining event.&#xD;
Patients will have follow-up visits on weeks: 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, and 48.</description>

&#xD;
          4. on treatment with a combination of antiviral drugs (HAART) for at least 12 months, and&#xD;
             stable on treatment for at least 3 months prior to enrollment. HAART is defined as an&#xD;
             antiretroviral regimen consisting of at least three registered antiretroviral drugs&#xD;
             (other than 3 Nucs only and low dose ritonavir used for boosting other protease&#xD;
             inhibitors does not count as one of these three antiretroviral agents)&#xD;
