    <description>Lowest effective dose of 3 formulations of the NES/E2 gel to ensure ovulation suppression (P&lt;10nmol/L) in 90-95% of the cycles. The high dose will deliver 4.5mg of NES; the medium dose will deliver 3mg of NES, and a low dose of 1.5mg of NES. Based on a 10% absorption rate, 450 µg/d, 300 µg/d and 150 µg/d will be absorbed respectively. The doses of Estradiol will also be tailored to the 3 formulations.</description>
