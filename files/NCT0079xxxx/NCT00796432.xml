  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to estimate the relationship of D2-receptor occupancy to&#xD;
      plasma concentration and to assess the safety of OROS paliperidone.&#xD;

      This is a single-center, single-dose, open-label, Phase-1 Positron Emission Tomography (PET)&#xD;
      study in 4 healthy volunteers, 2 men and 2 women. After screening, healthy eligible&#xD;
      volunteers will be hospitalized in the study unit from study Day 2 to Day 4. On Day 1 (the&#xD;
      day before hospitalization), volunteers will enter the study unit from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.&#xD;
      for baseline prolactin blood sampling and sedation assessment. Each volunteer will have a&#xD;
      control magnetic resonance imaging (at screening) and 3 PET measurements using the&#xD;
      radioligand [11]C raclopride to measure central D2 receptor occupancy in the putamen. Blood&#xD;
      samples to measure plasma concentrations of paliperidone will be collect immediately before&#xD;
      and at scheduled time points after dose administration on Day 2, and immediately before,&#xD;
      halfway through, and immediately after the PET-2 and PET-3 measurements. Serum prolactin&#xD;
      levels will be measured immediately before and at several scheduled time points after dose&#xD;
      administration, and immediately before and after each PET measurement. At scheduled time&#xD;
      points, supine and standing blood pressures, pulse, sensorium changes, temperature, and&#xD;
      degree of sedation will be recorded, volunteers will be questioned about adverse events, and&#xD;
      they will be evaluated for extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Adverse events will be recorded and&#xD;
      followed throughout the study. The rationale for the study design is based on previous PET&#xD;
      studies with risperidone, which indicated that PET measurement of D2 receptor occupancy after&#xD;
      a single dose of medication is useful in predicting an effective clinical dose range. Single&#xD;
      oral dose (6 mg) of OROS paliperidone&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Within 20% of ideal body weight&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If a woman, must be surgically sterile, or practicing an effective method of birth&#xD;
             control (e.g., prescription oral contraceptives, contraceptive injections,&#xD;
             intrauterine device, double-barrier method, male partner sterilization) before entry&#xD;
             and throughout the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  and must have a negative serum beta HCG test at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy on the basis of a pre-study physical examination, medical history, anamnesis,&#xD;
             electrocardiogram, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, and the results of blood&#xD;
             biochemistry and hematology tests and a urinalysis carried out less than 2 weeks&#xD;
             before the first dose. If the results of the biochemistry or hematology tests or the&#xD;
             urinalysis testing are not within the laboratory's reference ranges the volunteer can&#xD;
             be included only on condition that the investigator judges that the deviations are not&#xD;
             clinically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or suspicion of alcohol, barbiturate, amphetamine or narcotic abuse&#xD;
&#xD;

             neurologic, renal, hepatic, endocrine, or immunologic disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Drug allergy to raclopride, paliperidone, or risperidone or any of its excipients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of concomitant medication, except for paracetamol and hormonal contraceptives. All&#xD;
             other medication must have been stopped at least 14 days before the first PET&#xD;
             examination&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received an experimental drug or used an experimental medical device within 30 days&#xD;
             before the planned start of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previously used an antipsychotic medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previously participated in a PET study or measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Had a significant loss of blood &lt;1 month before the first PET examination&#xD;

          -  Pregnant as confirmed by a positive beta-HCG test at screening and before the first&#xD;
             PET examination, or breastfeeding&#xD;
