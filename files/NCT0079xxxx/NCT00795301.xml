      Primary Objectives To estimate the pathological complete response rate following neoadjuvant&#xD;
      radiotherapy with concurrent capecitabine and oxaliplatin, with or without cetuximab based on&#xD;
      the KRAS mutation status in rectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the incidence of grade 3-4 toxicities with each of the two neoadjuvant&#xD;
           regimens and during the 30-day post-operative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To estimate the clinical tumour response rate and sphincter preservation rate with each&#xD;
           of the two neoadjuvant regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To correlate EGRF gene amplification with pathological response rate in those treated&#xD;
           with cetuximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To estimate the pattern of failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To establish an annotated tissue library with samples being obtained prior to therapy&#xD;
           and following therapy (at the time of surgery).&#xD;

      Aims: The primary aim of this study is to estimate the pathological complete response rate&#xD;
      following neoadjuvant radiotherapy with concurrent capecitabine and oxaliplatin (CAPOX), with&#xD;
      or without cetuximab based on the KRAS mutation status in rectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody targeted against the EGF receptor, is active in&#xD;
      metastatic colorectal cancer and a radio-sensitizer. In colorectal cancer, the presence of&#xD;
      KRAS mutation has been associated with the absence of response to cetuximab. We hypothesise&#xD;
      that the addition of cetuximab to CAPOX concurrent with neoadjuvant radiotherapy only&#xD;
      benefited patients whose tumours do not have the KRAS mutation and therefore, personalizing&#xD;
      cetuximab therapy based on tumour KRAS mutation status may yield a higher pathological&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This study employed a standard 2-stage Phase II design to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      tolerability of two neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy regimens. The assignment of the neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy will be determined by the KRAS mutation status of the tumor. Subjects with KRAS&#xD;
      mutation will receive CAPOX. Subjects with no KRAS mutation will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      CAPOX +/- cetuximab.Definitive surgery is scheduled for 6-8 weeks after the completion of&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy. Surgical management will be a sphincter preservation approach whenever&#xD;
      possible, using the total mesorectal excision technique.After the operation, pathologic&#xD;
      evaluation of the surgical specimen will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance:In this proof-of-concept study, we aim to demonstrate that using an enriched&#xD;
      patient cohort to test our hypothesis that the addition of cetuximab will yield a higher&#xD;
      pathological response rate in KRAS mutation-negative rectal cancer. This approach can&#xD;
      potentially identify a subset of patients that may benefit from cetuximab and spare those who&#xD;
      may not benefit from unnecessary treatment toxicities and costs. Our study will help to&#xD;
      prioritise novel targeted agents for a smaller, faster, and less expensive confirmatory phase&#xD;
      III trials.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. All patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed T3/4 and/or node&#xD;
             positive adenocarcinoma of the rectum with the inferior border within 12 cm from the&#xD;
             anal verge without evidence of distant metastases, as evaluated by computed&#xD;
             tomography, ultrasonography, MRI or clinically.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
             leukocytes &gt;3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500/mcL platelets &gt;100,000/mcL&#xD;
             total bilirubin within normal institutional limits AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) greater than&#xD;
             2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal creatinine within normal institutional&#xD;
             limits&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Age &gt;21 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have ECOG performance status of 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must be 18 years old or greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The tumor must be considered by the surgeon to be amenable to curative resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who have had prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with stage I or IV cancer of the rectum.&#xD;
&#xD;

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Inability to take oral medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because agents use in the study may cause&#xD;
             fetal harm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with docetaxel. In addition, these&#xD;
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy.&#xD;
