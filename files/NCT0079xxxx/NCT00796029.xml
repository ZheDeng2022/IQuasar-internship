  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to investigate the metabolic pathways of paliperidone and&#xD;
      excretion of paliperidone and its metabolites in healthy adult male volunteers, both CYP2D6&#xD;
      poor and extensive metabolizers, after administration of a single 1-mg oral dose of&#xD;
      14C-paliperidone, to evaluate the safety and tolerability of paliperidone, and to determine&#xD;
      the relationship between genotypes (CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, UGT1A1, and UGT1A6) and exposure&#xD;
      to paliperidone and its metabolites.&#xD;

      This study is designed as a single-center, single-dose, open-label study of the absorption,&#xD;
      metabolism, and excretion of paliperidone in healthy men (3 extensive and 3 poor metabolizers&#xD;
      based on CYP2D6 phenotype). Eligible volunteers will be admitted to the study center the&#xD;
      evening before study drug administration and will remain at the study center until 168 hours&#xD;
      after dosing (or longer if required up to a maximum of 14 days). Each volunteer will receive&#xD;
      a single oral dose of 14C-paliperidone with total radioactivity below 1000 µSv (16 mCi).&#xD;
      Blood samples for plasma pharmacokinetic profile will be obtained immediately before study&#xD;
      drug administration and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 3, 6, 12, 16, 36, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144 and 168 hours&#xD;
      postdose. Blood samples will be obtained 2, 4, 8 and 24 hours postdose for determination of&#xD;
      14C in whole blood. Samples for determination of serum creatinine will be obtained 2, 4, 8&#xD;
      and 24 hours postdose. Urine will be collected immediately prior to drug administration and&#xD;
      from 0-4, 4-8, 8-12, 12-16, 16-24, 24-36, 36-48, 48-72, 72-96, 96-120, 120-144, and 144-168&#xD;
      hours after study drug administration. Fecal samples will be collected per each stool, once&#xD;
      before study drug administration and in the period from 0-168 hours after study drug&#xD;
      administration. Collections of urine and feces (per 24 hours) will continue beyond 168 hours,&#xD;
      to a maximum of 336 hours (Day 15) for patients who excrete radioactivity slowly (2 latest&#xD;
      24-hour urine collections each greater than or equal to 2% of total radioactive dose) or have&#xD;
      &lt;7 feces stool samples over the 0 to 168-hour period. 14C radioactivity will be measured in&#xD;
      plasma, urine, and feces. Aliquots of the 0- through 24 hour urine collections will be&#xD;
      analyzed for creatinine. Plasma concentrations of paliperidone and risperidone will be&#xD;
      determined by means of a validated LC MS/MS method. The 14C-labeled moiety in plasma and&#xD;
      urine will be determined by liquid scintillation counting. For all plasma samples, the lower&#xD;
      limits of quantification for paliperidone and risperidone will be 0.100 ng/mL. For all plasma&#xD;
      and urine samples the lower limits of quantification for 14C-paliperidone will be 72 dpm/mL&#xD;
      (=2.0n g eq/mL). The rationale for the present study with a single-dose administration of 1&#xD;
      mg 14C-paliperidone to healthy white men is to determine the routes of excretion for&#xD;
      paliperidone and to elucidate the metabolic pathways and structures of predominant&#xD;
      paliperidone metabolites. As such, this study will result in a more complete understanding of&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetics of paliperidone in humans. Safety and tolerability will be monitored.&#xD;
      Volunteers will receive a single oral 1 mg dose of 14C-paliperidone as a solution with a&#xD;
      specific activity of 592 kBq/mg, resulting in an administered radioactivity of 592 kBq (or 16&#xD;
      µCi). The total radioactive load for the subject will remain lower than 1000 µSv.&#xD;
