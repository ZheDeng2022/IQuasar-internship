      RATIONALE: Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Androgen ablation therapy&#xD;
      may lessen the amount of androgens made by the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known whether giving androgen ablation&#xD;
      therapy together with docetaxel is more effective than giving androgen ablation therapy alone&#xD;
      in treating patients with advanced prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying androgen ablation and docetaxel to see&#xD;
      how well they work compared with androgen ablation alone in treating patients with advanced&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the 2-year progression-free survival rate (biological progression and/or&#xD;
           clinical progression) in patients with advanced prostate cancer treated with androgen&#xD;
           ablation with vs without docetaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the time to treatment failure in patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the toxicity profiles of these regimens in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the PSA response rate in patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the response rate in patients with measurable disease treated with these&#xD;
           regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the percentage of patients who undergo PSA normalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the efficacy of these regimens in controlling bone pain in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the changes in chromogranin A levels in patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the total cost of care of patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue (LHRH-A) therapy for 6&#xD;
      months. Patients also receive antiandrogen therapy during the first 5 weeks of LHRH-A&#xD;
      therapy. After 6 months of LHRH-A therapy, patients with PSA response are randomized to 1 of&#xD;
      2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I: Patients continue to receive LHRH-A therapy until disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II:Patients receive LHRH-A therapy as in arm I. Patients also receive docetaxel IV&#xD;
           on day 1. Treatment with docetaxel repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the&#xD;
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete questionnaires during treatment to assess bone pain. Quality of life is&#xD;
      also assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion to study therapy, patients are followed for ≥ 2 years.&#xD;
