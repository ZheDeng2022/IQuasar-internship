  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory or degenerative diseases of the brain and spinal cord, such as multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis, may be related to problems with an individual s immune system. However, more&#xD;
      information is needed on the ways in which the cells of the immune system interact with the&#xD;
      central nervous system (CNS). This study will compare tests performed on both healthy&#xD;
      volunteers and individuals who have signs or symptoms of immune-related damage to their CNS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include two groups of subjects at least 12 years old. Subjects will either&#xD;
      have symptoms of immune-related CNS damage, or will be healthy volunteers selected for&#xD;
      comparison purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will visit the NIH Clinical Center on an outpatient basis for an initial&#xD;
      evaluation visit. During the visit, patients will provide a comprehensive medical history and&#xD;
      undergo a neurological examination, and will provide blood samples for research purposes. The&#xD;
      healthy volunteers will be asked to schedule a return visit for a magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) procedure, and may be asked to undergo other tests requested by the study researchers&#xD;
      on an as-needed basis. The group of patients with symptoms of immune-related CNS damage will&#xD;
      be asked to undergo a series of tests, including the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI procedures, with a minimum of three brain MRIs and one spinal cord MRI taken&#xD;
           approximately 4 weeks apart&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A diagnostic lumbar puncture, performed on an outpatient basis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tests of brain and vision activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional blood and tissue samples&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study participants will return for a followup visit 1 year after the initial evaluation&#xD;
      visit. Patients with symptoms of immune-related CNS damage may be offered the opportunity to&#xD;
      participate in additional followup tests with NIH researchers.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to define the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the&#xD;
      development of disability in immune-mediated disorders of the central nervous system (CNS)&#xD;
      and to distinguish these from beneficial responses of the human immune system to CNS injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol serves as a screening tool for Neuroimmunological Diseases Section (NDS) of the&#xD;
      National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) clinical trials and enables&#xD;
      development of clinically-useful tools such as diagnostic tests and new, sensitive scales of&#xD;
      neurological disability, disease severity and CNS tissue destruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol also serves as a repository to enable prospective institutional review board&#xD;
      (IRB) review of research using human samples and data collected under other NDS protocols.&#xD;
