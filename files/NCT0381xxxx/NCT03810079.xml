      This research will test a closed-loop system using EEG-arousal measures (spectral entropy) to&#xD;
      define the best moment of the day for application of transcranial direct current stimulation&#xD;
      (tDCS) in patients in MCS&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims at answering the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is tDCS applied during high vigilance states more effective in increasing the level of&#xD;
           conscious awareness than low vigilance states and/or sham stimulation in patients in&#xD;
           minimally conscious state (MCS)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is the EEG pattern (connectivity, complexity) different after application of active or&#xD;
           sham tDCS at high vigilance or low vigilance states?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Is there a difference in the profile of tDCS-responders as compared to non-responders&#xD;
           with regards to etiology, clinical diagnosis (MCS+/MCS-), age, gender, time post-injury,&#xD;
           functional outcome, structural and functional neuroimaging findings and EEG markers?&#xD;

    <textblock>
      During the last 20 years, with the rediscovering and development of noninvasive brain&#xD;
      stimulation (NIBS); techniques such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) have flourished thanks to the advancements in&#xD;
      functional imaging, elegant neurophysiological assessments, computer generated modeling, and&#xD;
      most importantly, the groundwork of well-designed research methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TDCS represents a safe, inexpensive and straightforward technique that could be easily&#xD;
      integrated in rehabilitation programs. In a first sham-controlled double-blind randomized&#xD;
      crossover study, the effect of a single prefrontal tDCS was evaluated in a heterogeneous&#xD;
      population of patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC), vegetative state (VS) and&#xD;
      minimally conscious state (MCS), acute-subacute (&lt; 3months) and chronic, with traumatic or&#xD;
      non-traumatic etiologies. At the individual level, tDCS responders were defined as patients&#xD;
      who presented a new sign of consciousness (e.g., command following; visual pursuit;&#xD;
      recognition, manipulation or localization of objects); after the active tDCS session, that&#xD;
      was not present before nor during the sham tDCS session. 13/30 patients in MCS showed a&#xD;
      tDCS-related improvement. 2 acute (&lt;3 months) patients in VS out of 25 showed a tDCS response&#xD;
      (i.e. showed command following and visual pursuit present after the anodal stimulation not&#xD;
      present at baseline or pre- or post- sham-tDCS). At group level, a treatment effect, as&#xD;
      measured by the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) was observed in the MCS but not in the VS&#xD;
      patients' group. In addition, no tDCS related side effects were observed. In another&#xD;
      sham-controlled study tDCS was applied for five days either over the primary motor cortex or&#xD;
      over the left prefrontal cortex in 10 chronic patients with DOC. In this trial, the effect of&#xD;
      tDCS have been assessed up to 12 months post stimulation. This study highlighted that even&#xD;
      chronic patients in DOC could improve and the effect could last up to 12 months post tDCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several tDCS studies have been performed by the Coma Science Group (Dr Thibaut) and other&#xD;
      groups. So far, a total of 221 patients with DOC have been included in eight studies without&#xD;
      any serious adverse event. In addition, three other trials performed by Naro et al including&#xD;
      a total of 59, did not report any adverse event either. Therefore, tDCS appears as a safe&#xD;
      technique, especially when applied by experts and highly trained investigators with a strong&#xD;
      background in both non-invasive brain stimulation and patients with disorders of&#xD;
      consciousness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a neurophysiological point of view, tDCS increases the neuronal excitability by&#xD;
      facilitating the action potential release and modification of the excitability of NMDA&#xD;
      receptors. Moreover, tDCS may strengthen task-related dynamical synaptic connections. The&#xD;
      effect of a single tDCS session last about 60 to 90 min. While, when the stimulation is&#xD;
      repeated for 10 to 20 sessions, the effects have been found to last up to 3 months after the&#xD;
      end of the stimulation sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major challenge in the application of tDCS to patients with DOC is the variability in the&#xD;
      individual behavioral response. Indeed, in previous studies conducted by the Coma Science&#xD;
      Group and other groups, the rate of responders was inconsistent across studies. As stated&#xD;
      above, a responder is a patient who showed a new sign of consciousness following the&#xD;
      application of active tDCS that was never observed beforehand nor before or after sham&#xD;
      stimulation. However, given the specificity of crossover designs used in these studies, this&#xD;
      definition was recently updated as a patient who showed a new sign of consciousness for the&#xD;
      first time after the application of active tDCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The next steps to optimize the applications of tDCS include a better identification of tDCS&#xD;
      responders beforehand. To that end, Thibaut and colleagues conducted a retrospective study&#xD;
      comparing the structural and metabolic neuroimagery profiles of patients who responded to&#xD;
      tDCS (n=8) and patients who did not (n=13), by the means of structural MRI T1 data and&#xD;
      18-fluorodeoxyglucose position emission tomography. The results showed a greater atrophy in&#xD;
      non-responders in regions including the left DLPFC, the medial-prefrontal cortex and the left&#xD;
      thalamus as compared to responders. The same areas as well as the thalamus were hypometabolic&#xD;
      in non-responders as compared to responders. This suggest that response to tDCS requires at&#xD;
      least partial structural and metabolic preservation of the stimulated area, as well as in&#xD;
      subcortical brains areas involved in attention and working memory. Later, the authors used&#xD;
      the same sample and retrospectively analyzed resting state EEG brain connectivity. The&#xD;
      results showed higher theta centrality in responders (as compared to non-responders) meaning&#xD;
      this new biomarker can be used to predict tDCS response in patients with DOC (Thibaut et al.&#xD;
      2018). Another key component to responsiveness is the timing of the stimulations. Indeed,&#xD;
      patients with DOC typically present fluctuations in vigilance impacting their responsiveness&#xD;
      to any kind of external stimuli. Patients in MCS even show a periodicity of 70 minutes in&#xD;
      these fluctuations (range 57-80), comparable to the fluctuations in attention observed in&#xD;
      healthy controls, while patient in VS do not present this type of periodicity. Piarulli and&#xD;
      colleagues used the spectral entropy measured with resting EEG to highlight the periodicity&#xD;
      in its fluctuations and suggested that the EEG spectral entropy variability in MCS could&#xD;
      mirror the fluctuation of awareness previously described in this population. Administering&#xD;
      tDCS during specific time windows (i.e., periods of low or high arousal) could therefore&#xD;
      influence its clinical efficacy in patients in MCS since it is known that the positive&#xD;
      effects of tDCS are dependent on the brain neural state. To this end, recent advances in&#xD;
      information technology enable the implementation of a closed-loop set-up by complex&#xD;
      computations being performed in real-time. Using this technology to target specific levels of&#xD;
      vigilance with tDCS in patient in MCS could provide insight in understanding the patterns of&#xD;
      responding to that treatment and optimize future applications.&#xD;
