    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate of the relationships between fractionated exhaled&#xD;
      nitric oxide, disease activity, and symptom severity in patients with eosinophilic&#xD;
      esophagitis compared to those without eosinophilic esophagitis.&#xD;

    <description>The FeNO measurement will be performed using a hand-held analyzer, the NIOX MINO (Aerocrine, Sweden). During this non-invasive procedure the patient is asked to perform a 4-6 second single-breath exhalation into the NIOX MINO, which measures FeNO in 100s with an electrochemical sensor.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pediatric patient who will undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsies at&#xD;
             Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital, as part of the standard of care in the&#xD;
             evaluation of EoE&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to perform the single-breath exhalation for the hand-held analyzer, NIOX MINO&#xD;
             (Aerocrine, Sweden)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed informed consent by a parent or legal guardian&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed assent form by the child/adolescent subjects 7-18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Past medical history of asthma, allergic rhinitis, IBD, parasitic infection, hay fever&#xD;
             and any exposure to smoking (including secondhand smoke) because these disorders are&#xD;
             known to affect the FeNO levels&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active respiratory tract infections at the time of FeNO evaluation because this can&#xD;
             affect the result of the FeNO as well&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Asthma questionnaire and/or Spirometry test consistent with asthma&#xD;
