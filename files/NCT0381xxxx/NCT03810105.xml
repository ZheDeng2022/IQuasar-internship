             subject's medical record, previously obtained genomic testing from a CLIA-certified&#xD;
             lab, or via archival or fresh tissue.&#xD;

             result), hepatitis C, or active infection with human immunodeficiency virus (positive&#xD;
             HIV 1/2 antibodies). Subjects with a past or resolved HBV infection (defined as&#xD;
             presence of hepatitis B core antibody [anti-HBc] and absence of HBsAg) are eligible.&#xD;

             consultation with the Sponsor Principal Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No subjects who are HIV-positive on combination antiretroviral therapy because of the&#xD;
             potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with olaparib. In addition, these subjects&#xD;
