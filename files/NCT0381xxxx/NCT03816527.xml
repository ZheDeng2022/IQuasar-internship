  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The planned study will investigate the selective attention to emotional and alcohol-related&#xD;
      stimuli in alcohol-dependent patients and healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      background Attitudinal shifts in the implicit cognitive processing of alcohol-associated&#xD;
      stimuli play a major role in the maintenance of addictive disorders, in the development of&#xD;
      alcohol cravings, and ultimately in relapse. There are several experimental methods to study&#xD;
      the selective attention to image stimuli. For preliminary studies as well as for the planned&#xD;
      study, we opted for the so-called Dotprobe task , in which image pairs (alcohol versus&#xD;
      neutral stimulus) are presented. The selective attention can be measured by means of reaction&#xD;
      time differences. In addition to alcohol-related stimuli, photos of fearful and happy faces&#xD;
      that act as emotional stimuli are also used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a preliminary study, the investigators were able to show that not only alcoholics, but&#xD;
      also healthy light social drinkers, showed an initial orientation towards alcohol stimuli.&#xD;
      The presence of such a shift in attention to alcoholic stimuli, even in healthy individuals,&#xD;
      could be a consequence of the processing of alcoholic stimuli as emotional stimuli of&#xD;
      increased salience compared to affectively neutral stimuli. There are still no studies that&#xD;
      collectively examine selective attention to both emotional and alcohol-associated stimuli.&#xD;
      While some studies have shown selective attention to fear stimuli compared to neutral stimuli&#xD;
      only in populations with clinically relevant increased anxiety, there are also studies who&#xD;
      were able to show that there is selective attention to evolutionarily relevant anxiety even&#xD;
      in healthy individuals. In these non-clinical populations, this selective attention appears&#xD;
      to be particularly prevalent in subjects with increased anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies using affective positive stimuli such as happy faces showed selective attention to&#xD;
      these positive valent stimuli in healthy people compared to neutral stimuli, which was also&#xD;
      associated with the current mood . Thus, the selective attention to cheerful faces, for&#xD;
      example, in a positive mood was also increased. Emotional processing is relevant in the&#xD;
      development and maintenance of addictive diseases as well as in so-called &quot;prolonged&#xD;
      withdrawal&quot;. Thus, during abstinence among alcoholics, increased anxiety, irritability and&#xD;
      dysphoria, the so-called &quot;negative emotional state of withdrawal&quot;, appear. In a functional&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) study, it was shown that when anxious faces were seen,&#xD;
      acute alcohol abuse had anxiolytic effects. In a separate study with disgusting images on&#xD;
      cigarette packs as an aversive fear stimuli, we found that smokers showed a shift in&#xD;
      attention to these disgusting images was associated with relief craving and was also&#xD;
      associated with increased anxiety, especially in heavy smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will compare the selective attention to emotional and alcohol-related stimuli&#xD;
      between alcoholics and healthy people. Furthermore, their association with positive and&#xD;
      negative mood as well as anxiety should be considered. The aim is to investigate whether&#xD;
      alcoholic stimuli are processed the same way in healthy people, such as appetitive, emotional&#xD;
      stimuli and whether patients' alcohol stimuli are processed like aversive, emotional stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This question is interesting both methodically and clinically. On the one hand, it would be&#xD;
      methodologically important to interpret whether healthy alcohol-associated stimuli are&#xD;
      appetitive or similar to affectively positive stimuli for the interpretation of studies on&#xD;
      selective attention to alcohol stimuli and alcohol-stimulant reactivity. Clinically&#xD;
      significant would be the identification of patients with increased selective attention to&#xD;
      alcohol and anxiety stimuli, for whom the risk of relapse could be increased by confronting&#xD;
      these stimuli. From these findings, therapeutic options could be derived, such as the&#xD;
      application of exposure therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Alcohol-dependent patients as well as healthy volunteers have a selective shift of&#xD;
           attention to alcohol-associated versus neutral stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The selective attention to happy faces is associated with positive mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The selective attention to anxious faces is associated with the degree of anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The selective attention to anxious faces is increased in alcoholics compared to healthy&#xD;
           controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The selective attention to happy faces is lowered in alcoholics in comparison to healthy&#xD;
           controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Selective attention to alcohol-associated stimuli in healthy controls is associated with&#xD;
           positive mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Selective attention to alcohol-related stimuli is associated with negative mood in&#xD;
           alcohol-dependent patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will examine 40 alcohol-dependent patients and 40 healthy volunteers.&#xD;
