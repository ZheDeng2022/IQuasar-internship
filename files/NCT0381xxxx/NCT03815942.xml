  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial of a new treatment for prostate cancer that is a type of vaccine&#xD;
      that could be a new way to treat cancer. A vaccine that could alert the immune system to the&#xD;
      presence of cancer cells in the body may enable the immune system to target and kill those&#xD;
      cells effectively. This vaccine is intended to work by making the immune system kill cells&#xD;
      that have a special protein (called 5T4) that is present on the surface of cancer cells. The&#xD;
      vaccine is made up of two recombinant viruses (&quot;ChAdOx1&quot;- chimpanzee adenovirus Ox1 and &quot;MVA&quot;&#xD;
      - modified vaccinia Ankara) that have been designed to produce the 5T4 protein and have been&#xD;
      modified so that they are weakened and cannot reproduce themselves within the body like&#xD;
      normal viruses. Once injected into the body, these viruses make the 5T4 protein and help the&#xD;
      body's immune system to learn to target this protein and destroy cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This vaccine will be used in combination with the immunotherapy drug called nivolumab which&#xD;
      is an anti-PD-1 (Programmed Death protein-1) monoclonal antibody. This is a molecule that&#xD;
      releases the brakes on the immune system and helps the immune system to kill cancer cells&#xD;
      more efficiently. Nivolumab as a monotherapy was approved for treatment of several tumour&#xD;
      types but not for the prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of ChAdOx1-MVA 5T4 vaccine in combination&#xD;
      with nivolumab in low and intermediate risk prostate cancer patients who have elected to have&#xD;
      their prostate removed and in patients with advanced metastatic prostate cancer.&#xD;
