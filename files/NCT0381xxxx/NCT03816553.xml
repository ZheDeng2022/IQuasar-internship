  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of SHR-1210 in combination&#xD;
      with apatinib in treating patients with metastatic, persistent, or recurrent cervical cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SHR-1210 is a humanized monoclonal antibody against Programmed death 1(PD-1). Apatinib is a&#xD;
      small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) selectively inhibits Vascular Endothelial&#xD;
      Growth Factor Receptor 2 (VEGFR-2). Patients with metastatic, persistent, or recurrent&#xD;
      cervical cancer who failed to first-line chemotherapy +/- bevacizumab will received SHR-1210&#xD;
      200mg (3mg/kg for underweight patients) iv every 2 weeks and apatinib 250mg orally once&#xD;
      daily. The efficacy and safety will be observed.&#xD;
