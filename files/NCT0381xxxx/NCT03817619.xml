  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elbasvir/grazoprevir (ZepatierÂ®) is a once-daily tablet for the treatment of chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) GT1a, 1b or 4 infection containing the NS5A inhibitor elbasvir (ELB)&#xD;
      50 mg and the NS3/4A protease inhibitor grazoprevir (GZR) 100 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with swallowing difficulties, administration of whole tablets can be&#xD;
      problematic. In addition, HCV patients that are hospitalized (at intensive care units) due to&#xD;
      severe illness (co-infections/ liver failure) might not be able to swallow medication.&#xD;
      Therefore it is useful to know whether it is possible to administer ELB/GZR through a&#xD;
      different route, like a feeding tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In daily practice, information about the safety and efficacy of crushed tablets is lacking&#xD;
      which might result in noncompliance, interruption or discontinuation of expensive HCV&#xD;
      therapy. However, it is not recommended to interrupt treatment because there is no evidence&#xD;
      about the efficacy of the therapy after discontinuation (and restarting).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, patients and healthcare professionals are crushing tablets without information&#xD;
      about efficacy and safety. Depending on the biopharmaceutical characteristics of a drug&#xD;
      formulation, crushing tablets can lead to altered pharmacokinetics of drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to know whether pharmacokinetic parameters are influenced by crushing of&#xD;
      tablets; both a decrease and an increase in exposure may occur. A decrease of the plasma&#xD;
      concentrations of ELB and/or GZR potentially reduces the therapeutic effect of the drugs.&#xD;
      Higher doses or switching to other HCV-drugs might be needed. In contrast, in case a higher&#xD;
      Cmax and/or AUC occurs there might be an increased risk of toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result, crushing the drug is a contra-indication based on the available data. Therefore&#xD;
      this study will be conducted to investigate whether a crushed ELB/GZR tablet is bioequivalent&#xD;
      to ELB/GZR as a whole tablet.&#xD;
