      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies indicate that patient characteristics and clinical and psychological factors&#xD;
      are related to the effect of surgical treatment but more knowledge about predictors is&#xD;
      important in the selection of patients for arthroscopic subacromial decompression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify patient characteristics and clinical and psychological factors for&#xD;
      pre-operatively predicting the effect of arthroscopic subacromial decompression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients meting the inclusion criteria will consecutively be enrolled in the study when&#xD;
      referred to arthroscopic subacromial decompression. Prior to surgery, patient characteristics&#xD;
      and clinical data will be collected. At six and twelve month postoperatively, the effect of&#xD;
      the surgical treatment will be assessed. The relationship between effect of surgery and&#xD;
      patient characteristics and clinical factors collected at baseline will be examined.&#xD;

      Introduction: Shoulder disorders are the third most common musculoskeletal reason for seeking&#xD;
      medical care and accounts for approximately 1% of all visits to the general practitioner and&#xD;
      for up to 10% of all referrals to physiotherapists. The prevalence of shoulder disorders has&#xD;
      been reported to range from 7% to 26% with some indication that the prevalence increases with&#xD;
      age. Subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS) is usually described as a symptomatic irritation&#xD;
      of the rotator cuff and the subacromial bursa, and it is considered as one of the most common&#xD;
      shoulder disorders. Patients with SIS may present symptoms such as pain during activity, pain&#xD;
      at night, loss of muscle strength, and stiffness. Because the shoulder stabilizes the upper&#xD;
      limb in its activities, these symptoms affect the performance of tasks essential to daily&#xD;
      living. Shoulder disorders produce significant impairments in function and health related&#xD;
      quality of life (HR-QoL), and results in substantial health care utilization. SIS frequently&#xD;
      affects the working population and is an important cause of sick leave.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of SIS consists of either conservative- or surgical treatment. Conservative&#xD;
      treatments include rest, physiotherapy, non-steroid anti inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and&#xD;
      glucocorticoid injections, while surgical treatment consists of arthroscopic or open&#xD;
      subacromial decompression, bursectomy and rotator cuff repair. Physiotherapy interventions&#xD;
      are recommended as first choice of treatment, while surgical treatment can be considered for&#xD;
      those who fail to respond to conservative treatment after 3-6 months. Several studies&#xD;
      comparing the effect of arthroscopic subacromial decompression (ASAD) and supervised&#xD;
      physiotherapy exercises, have found no significant differences in outcomes between the two&#xD;
      treatment strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Denmark, the number of patients with SIS has increased by 36% from 2006 to 2010. The&#xD;
      number of patients treated surgically has increased by 60% to approximately 6500 a year in&#xD;
      the same period. Similar increases are reported in other countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The literature indicates that some patients do not benefit from ASAD, and success rates&#xD;
      between 65-80% have been reported. In Denmark, 10% of employed patients retire prematurely&#xD;
      within two years after surgery. Results of studies investigating if ASAD is more effective in&#xD;
      selected subgroups of patients showed that clinical and radiological factors and patient&#xD;
      characteristics such as sociodemographic, duration of symptoms and duration of sick leave,&#xD;
      were associated with the effect of treatment. In addition, psychological factors are reported&#xD;
      to impact outcome in both shoulder patients, and other orthopaedic patients. A preoperative&#xD;
      scoring system to select patients for ASAD has been developed. However, this focuses on&#xD;
      clinical and radiographic factors, and does not consider patient characteristics and&#xD;
      psychological factors. Knowledge about predictors for the effect of ASAD in a broader&#xD;
      perspective will be of great importance, from both a patient- and an economic perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The overall aim of the study is to identify patient characteristic and clinical and&#xD;
      psychological factors that preoperatively can predict which patients will achieve effect of&#xD;
      ASAD. Furthermore, to investigate the quality of objective methods to assess shoulder&#xD;
      function, and the association between patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) and objective&#xD;
      outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power considerations: Based on data extracted from the Central Denmark Region Electronic&#xD;
      Patient Journal (Mid EPJ) an estimation of 150 patients annually undergo ASAD at Aarhus&#xD;
      University Hospital. With a planned inclusion period of two years and a drop out rate of 10%,&#xD;
      it means that 270 patients will be included. Using an estimate of 20% it is expected that 54&#xD;
      out of 270 patients will not benefit from ASAD. The number of patients without the effect of&#xD;
      ASAD will affect the number of potential predictors that can be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome assessment: Effect of surgical treatment will be assessed with two instruments: 1)&#xD;
      patient evaluated success of treatment with the response options: much improved, moderate&#xD;
      improved, unchanged, moderate worse, and much worse and 2) the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS).&#xD;
      Effect of surgical treatment will be defined as a much - or moderate improvement evaluated by&#xD;
      the patient, or an improvement of more than 12 points in OSS between baseline and follow-up.&#xD;
      The 12 point criterion is previous used to develop a preoperative scoring system to select&#xD;
      patients for ASAD.&#xD;
