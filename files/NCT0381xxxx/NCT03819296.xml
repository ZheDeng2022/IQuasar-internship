      This trial studies the role of the gut microbiome and effectiveness of a fecal transplant on&#xD;
      medication-induced gastrointestinal (GI) complications in patients with melanoma or&#xD;
      genitourinary cancer. The gut microbiome (the bacteria and microorganisms that live in the&#xD;
      digestive system) may affect whether or not someone develops colitis (inflammation of the&#xD;
      intestines) during cancer treatment with immune-checkpoint inhibitor drugs. Studying samples&#xD;
      of stool, blood, and tissue from patients with melanoma or genitourinary cancer may help&#xD;
      doctors learn more about the effects of treatment on cells, and help doctors understand how&#xD;
      well patients respond to treatment. Treatment with fecal transplantation may help to improve&#xD;
      diarrhea and colitis symptoms.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the difference in stool microbiome pattern between patients who develop&#xD;
      immune-checkpoint inhibitor (ICPI)-related colitis and patients who don't develop&#xD;
      ICPI-related colitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare the difference in stool microbiome pattern in patients who developed&#xD;
      ICPI-related colitis before and after colitis medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the safety and tolerability and efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation&#xD;
      (FMT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify and characterize immune profile and genetic factors associated with onset of&#xD;
      ICPI-related colitis in blood and colon tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To identify and characterize immune profile and genetic factors in blood and colon tissue&#xD;
      that are associated with quick response of ICPI-related colitis to medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To characterize the endoscopic and histologic features of ICPI-related colitis before&#xD;
      and after medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To document the changes of ICPI-related symptoms and the impact on functioning and&#xD;
      quality of life (QoL) from fecal microbiota transplantation by patient-reported outcomes&#xD;
      (PRO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess stool microbiome and cytokine features that are associated with good response to&#xD;
      fecal microbiota transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To assess the factors in genetic/immune profile obtained from blood and colon tissue that&#xD;
      are associated with good response to fecal microbiota transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To characterize the endoscopic and histologic features of ICPI-related colitis before&#xD;
      and after fecal microbiota transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify and characterize immune profile and genetic factors associated with onset of&#xD;
      ICPI-related colitis in inflamed colonic mucosa and its matched normal mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To characterize the immune profile and genetic factors from the colon tissue in these&#xD;
      colitis patients among different histological subtypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the pattern of stool microbiome that is associated with good tumor response to&#xD;
      ICPI treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess the association between stool inflammatory markers (i.e. lactoferrin and&#xD;
      calprotectin) and the severity of endoscopic/histologic inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess the sensitivity and specificity of stool inflammatory markers (i.e. lactoferrin&#xD;
      and calprotectin) as an indicators of ICPI-relate colitis response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To assess the microbiome pattern that triggers the infections on immunosuppressant&#xD;
      treatment for ICPI colitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECT 1: Patients receive standard of care and undergo collection of stool and blood&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECT 2: Patients receive prednisone, infliximab, or vedolizumab per standard of care and&#xD;
      undergo standard of care endoscopy 2 months after treatment. Patients also undergo collection&#xD;
      of stool, blood, and tissue samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECT 3: Patients undergo fecal microbiota transplant (FMT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up periodically.&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint is alpha diversity of bacteria species (measured using inverse Simpson index). It is a measure of diversity which takes into account the number of species present, as well as the relative abundance of each species. As species richness and evenness increase, so diversity increases.</description>
