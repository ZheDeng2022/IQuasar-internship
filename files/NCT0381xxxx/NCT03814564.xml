      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Circulatory shock is a frequent condition in the intensive care unit, comprising roughly one&#xD;
      of three patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), and associated with high mortality rates.&#xD;
      Current treatment guidelines state that one of the main goals for therapeutic interventions&#xD;
      is to improve tissue perfusion to prevent subsequent organ dysfunction and death. In acute&#xD;
      critical illness, up to one fourth of the patients develop severe hemostatic aberrations and&#xD;
      coagulopathy, called disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which is associated with&#xD;
      excess mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite differences in the underlying cause, acutely critically ill patients share similar&#xD;
      features that may be driven by shock. This response, potentially escalating to&#xD;
      life-threatening conditions, is relatively homogenous. The shock induced sympatho-adrenal&#xD;
      hyperactivation may be a critical driver this endotheliopathy. If allowed to proceed&#xD;
      uncontrollably, damages to the microcirculation and organ dysfunction may follow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), a non-invasive method based on the principles of light&#xD;
      transmission and absorption, offers a non-invasive and continuous bedside method to assess&#xD;
      tissue haemoglobin oxygen saturation (StO2), which may serve as an indirect measure of the&#xD;
      adequacy of tissue perfusion. NIRS could potentially be used for early identification of&#xD;
      patients with tissue hypoperfusion and therefore high risk of developing organ dysfunction,&#xD;
      and may also be used for assessing frontal cerebral oxygen saturation in circulatory failure&#xD;
      and its use is well documented in general anaesthesia in many patient groups. There are some&#xD;
      data showing an association between low frontal StO2 values and delirium in the ICU. The use&#xD;
      of near-infrared spectroscopy to measure tissue oxygenation in healthy humans has been well&#xD;
      validated. However, assessing tissue oxygenation using NIRS in critically ill patients is&#xD;
      less well established. The hemodynamic and other systemic responses in burns are similar to&#xD;
      those in septic shock. However, the mechanisms behind these responses have not been compared&#xD;
      between burn and septic shock patients to our knowledge. Overall, the knowledge of&#xD;
      microcirculation and how to monitor it in burn patients is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the observational cohort study is (1) to deduce whether measurements of&#xD;
      peripheral NIRS (lower limb registered proximal of the knee cap) associate with the&#xD;
      development of organ dysfunction as assessed by daily sequential organ failure assessment&#xD;
      score (SOFA) in the ICU during days 1 to 7 in the ICU, (2) whether cerebral (frontal) StO2&#xD;
      values are associated with delirium in the ICU and (3) the association of frontal and&#xD;
      peripheral StO2 with other micro- and macrohemodynamic parameters in this patient group , (4)&#xD;
      to deduce the associations between shock, endotheliopathy, DIC and tissue perfusion and,&#xD;
      last, the feasibility of central and peripheral NIRS monitoring in shock patients in the ICU&#xD;
      using the INVOS tm NIRS StO2 appliances. In addition, the investigators target to evaluate&#xD;
      (5) the incidence, evolution, and outcome of sepsis-associated disseminated intravascular&#xD;
      coagulation (DIC), and (6) the associations between a) continuous hemodynamic data, b)&#xD;
      laboratory data (such as syndecan-1 (SDC-1), vascular adhesion protein 1 (VAP1), CD73,&#xD;
      heparin binding protein (HBP), endostatin, chromogranin, mitochondrial function tests, blood&#xD;
      count d-dimer, INR, neuron specific enolase and metabolomics data) (7) and study associations&#xD;
      of singlenucleotide polymorphisms with developing organ dysfunction and 90-day mortality. To&#xD;
      compare the hemodynamic alterations of burn patients to septic patients with the intention to&#xD;
      find new ways to monitor and manage hemodynamic and particularly microcirculation in burn&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational multi-center study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with circulatory shock admitted to the intensive care units (ICU) fulfilling the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 250patients with circulatory shock with NIRS registration A minimum of 400&#xD;
      patients with sepsis for evaluation of incidence of DIC and metabolomics and genetic tests&#xD;
      (genome-wide association study, GWAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with circulatory shock admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) fulfilling the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria but none of the exclusion criteria within 4 hours of vasopressor&#xD;
      inititation in the ICU and signs of clinical hypoperfusion or elevated lactate levels.&#xD;
      Frontal and peripheral NIRS StO2 registration is performed using the Medtronic INVOS&#xD;
      appliances and bilateral central and peripheral sensors for 48 hours from study inclusion.&#xD;
      The INVOS NIRS registration is blinded and cannot be used for clinical decision making. The&#xD;
      frontal and peripheral StO2 registrations will be collected for further analyses. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be taken from an arterial cannula at inclusion, and at 12 h, 24h and 48h, blood&#xD;
      gas samples will be drawn every 2 hours. Data on demographic data, health status, chronic&#xD;
      illnesses and medications prior to ICU admission will be collected during the study.&#xD;
      Hemodynamic data, information on vasopressor and inotrope medication, need and use of&#xD;
      sedatives, fluid balance and specific ICU interventions during the ICU stay will also be&#xD;
      collected, as well as daily intensive care delirium screening checklist (ICDSC) and&#xD;
      SOFA-score registrations. An electronic case report form (CRF) will be used in the study. In&#xD;
      addition to clinical data, data of feasibility and reported problems considering the use of&#xD;
      NIRS StO2 registrations will be collected. Blood samples will be frozen and stored locally&#xD;
      for further processing and analyses.&#xD;
