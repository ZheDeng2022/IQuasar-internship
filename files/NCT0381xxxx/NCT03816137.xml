  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EVAI2020_01 is a single blinded two part experimental medicine study to determine the extent&#xD;
      to which different prime-boost combinations of model immunogens based on HIV-1 envelope&#xD;
      proteins (ConM and ConS), influence the breadth of viruses neutralised by induced antibodies&#xD;
      and the associated diversity of B and T cell responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research will investigate the effect of a second immunisation challenge with a&#xD;
      combination of three model mosaic envelope proteins designed to increase the breadth of&#xD;
      induced antibody neutralisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be measurement of specific viral neutralisation activity of serum&#xD;
      antibodies. Exploratory outcomes will include characterisation of blood B and T cell&#xD;
      responses to these model immunogens.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the most effective arms of the human immune system is the ability of very low&#xD;
      concentrations of antibody proteins to bind to viruses, bacteria and toxins and &quot;neutralise&quot;&#xD;
      their activity or ability to infect. In contrast to cellular immunity, which may cause tissue&#xD;
      destruction and pathology, antibody-mediated immunity can be very passive, while completely&#xD;
      preventing infection. How antibodies bind their targets varies enormously, ranging from&#xD;
      unhelpful &quot;blocking&quot; antibodies or narrowly focussed neutralising antibodies, to highly&#xD;
      protective &quot;broadly neutralising&quot; antibodies (bNAbs) that can neutralise a wide range of&#xD;
      strains of the same pathogen. Such bNAbs are especially sought after in virus infections such&#xD;
      as HIV, influenza and others where the virus mutates to evade immune responses that are too&#xD;
      narrow or focussed. Antibodies arise when an &quot;immunogen&quot; (an immunogen is anything that&#xD;
      induces an immune response, typically a foreign protein) is taken up by the immune system and&#xD;
      shown to white blood cells - T and B cells - by specialised immune cells. In some cases the T&#xD;
      and B cells bind the immunogens to receptors on their surface, triggering an immune response&#xD;
      in which T cells &quot;help&quot; B cells to manufacture specific antibodies. The events around how the&#xD;
      protein is processed into manageable pieces, shown to the T and B cells, and the pattern of&#xD;
      chemical signals produced by the immune cells is highly complex, but eventually determines&#xD;
      how broad the antibody response will be (its breadth). For infections like HIV and influenza,&#xD;
      decades of research and clinical vaccine trials have had limited or no success. To take HIV&#xD;
      as an example, investigators have an almost complete lack of understanding of how immunogens&#xD;
      interact with the naive human B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire and the pathways required to&#xD;
      induce bNAbs during an infection or after an immunisation. Animal models have failed as the&#xD;
      na√Øve, germline encoded, B cell antibody receptor repertoires of non-human species are&#xD;
      sufficiently different from those of humans to render design and selection of vaccine based&#xD;
      on non-human species problematic. Additionally, bNAbs isolated from HIV-1-infected&#xD;
      individuals have structural features that occur rarely or not at all in other mammals, such&#xD;
      as unusually long loop-binding regions (CDRH3 loops) required to penetrate past glycans on&#xD;
      the surface of the envelope spike that shield key neutralising epitopes (Mascola JR 2013).&#xD;
      There is therefore a critical need to better understand, in human experimental medicine&#xD;
      models of immune challenge, how immunogens and B/T cells interact in the development of&#xD;
      protective bNAb anti-viral responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our approach to resolving this impasse is to challenge the human immune system with&#xD;
      rationally-designed model immunogens to determine the structural and other characteristics&#xD;
      required to drive human B cell antibody responses towards neutralisation breadth.&#xD;
      Investigators have selected HIV as an experimental model as there is a reasonable&#xD;
      understanding about the specificity and function of anti-HIV bNAbs, as well as an urgent need&#xD;
      to identify novel immunisation approaches following decades of failed or poorly successful&#xD;
      trials. There is also a huge database of safety using HIV proteins as immunogens, and the&#xD;
      technological expertise to design and manufacture HIV viral proteins. Assays for HIV&#xD;
      neutralising activity are also well established in our laboratories. Although focussed on&#xD;
      HIV, our findings will be applicable to other viral infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The model immunogens proposed in the experimental medicine studies are unlikely to be&#xD;
      suitable as vaccines, and any clinical development would require iterative cycles of design&#xD;
      refinement and development based on immunological insights gleaned from these experimental&#xD;
      investigations. Therefore, the focus is on in-depth characterisation of the elicited immune&#xD;
      response to rationally-designed model immunogens that may inform the design process of actual&#xD;
      vaccines. This experimental medicine approach is only now possible due to unprecedented&#xD;
      progress in our abilities to study the human immune system and to obtain complete information&#xD;
      on immune responses to vaccination, since performing research on the human immune system is&#xD;
      now almost as easy as it has been in mice. The main focus of this study will be to determine&#xD;
      which of the design strategies is able to prime human germline (naive) B cells and drive&#xD;
      antibody responses towards induction of neutralising antibody breadth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our range of model immunogens will be based on the envelope (Env) glycoprotein of HIV-1,&#xD;
      which is the only target of neutralising antibodies, and therefore the only virally-encoded&#xD;
      immunogen relevant for induction of such antibodies by immunisation. To ensure&#xD;
      reproducibility of results and the highest level of volunteer safety, all immunogens will be&#xD;
      manufactured under cGMP, using techniques applied to vaccine immunogens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Env has extensive amino acid variation, structural and conformational instability, and&#xD;
      immunodominance of hypervariable regions (Kwong PD, 2011; Sattentau QJ, 2013). Our team&#xD;
      designed soluble immunogens that closely mimic the native viral trimer in situ, but that&#xD;
      incorporate design strategies that may alter the intrinsic viral immune evasion mechanisms&#xD;
      (Sanders RW, 2013). Env is made up of three identical complexes (trimers) each of which&#xD;
      contains two molecules, gp120 and gp41 that can be modified to make a soluble molecule called&#xD;
      gp140, upon which our immunogens are based. Investigators have developed model consensus&#xD;
      gp140 Env trimers (consensus of all global strains) designed to prime B cell responses to&#xD;
      common epitopes represented in all HIV-1 subtypes. Investigators have utilised two design&#xD;
      strategies to stabilise these in a native-like conformation: ConM SOSIP and ConS UFO. The&#xD;
      ConM SOSIP trimer includes novel mutations that include the incorporation of a disulphide&#xD;
      linkage between the gp120 and gp41 ectodomain (making up gp140) which prevents their&#xD;
      disassociation into monomer subunits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ConS UFO includes a short flexible amino-acid linker to tether the gp120 and gp41&#xD;
      subunits together as an alternative strategy to prevent dissociation of the Env trimer.&#xD;
      Investigators wish to test both designs to determine the effect on B cell repertoire. To&#xD;
      further stabilize global architecture, investigators employed an EDC crosslinking approach&#xD;
      that has been shown to conserve bNAb epitopes, reduce non-antiviral antibody responses, and&#xD;
      enhance overall immunogen stability (Schiffner et al., 2015). Thus, in Part 1 of this study&#xD;
      investigators will test EDC ConM SOSIP and EDC ConS UFO versions in parallel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A critical adjunct to our consensus-based model design is to use a cocktail of three mosaic&#xD;
      gp140 Env trimers as a boost (Part 2) to overcome the immunodominance of hypervariable&#xD;
      regions of Env and to determine whether this will focus antibody responses towards conserved&#xD;
      neutralisation epitopes. While designed using computer algorithms, these mosaics represent&#xD;
      authentic Env structures that are fully functional and native in their conformation. Our&#xD;
      novel designs aim to eliminate unwanted immunodominant antibody responses and focus B cells&#xD;
      towards highly conserved supersites of vulnerability on Env, with particular emphasis on&#xD;
      quaternary bNAb epitopes (Julien, JP, 2013; Kong L, 2013; Lyumkis D, 2013). The extent to&#xD;
      which these different strategies may induce neutralising breadth, and the identification of&#xD;
      the mechanisms and drivers involved, can only be determined empirically through human&#xD;
      immunogen challenge studies.&#xD;
