  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the efficiency of emergency procedures and patient&#xD;
      satisfaction within the GHPS (Groupe Hospitalier Pitié Salpêtrière) Dental Emergency&#xD;
      Department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain is the main reason of consultation at dental emergency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators evaluate the pain felt before and after the intervention of the emergency&#xD;
      with questionnaires at the day of the consultation (D0), then with phone interviews at D1, D3&#xD;
      and D7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also evaluate the quality of the reception and care provided in the GHPS&#xD;
      service using a satisfaction questionnaire completed by the patients at D0.&#xD;

      I. Research progress&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two investigators will take turns in the service for the research duration. They will be&#xD;
      responsible for informing patients of the research upon their arrival in the service, for the&#xD;
      data collection and telephone follow-ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The course of the research will take place as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day of consultation (D0):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient information on the research when he arrives in the service; explanation of its&#xD;
           objectives, its modalities and constraints.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Verification of eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Collection of the patient's non-opposition by the dentist during the consultation&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Consultation according to the usual care. During this procedure, the practitioner&#xD;
           performs a medical history and, according to the patient's answers, completes the&#xD;
           &quot;General Information Questionnaire&quot;. He carries out the emergency care and explains the&#xD;
           postoperative consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patient filling in the satisfaction questionnaire immediately after consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Telephone follow-up (D1, D3, D7):&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Telephone follow-up by the interviewer and fill in the questionnaire - in case of&#xD;
           non-availability of the patient on day 1, the patient will be recalled on day 2 and the&#xD;
           extrapolated data on the slope of the curve between D1 and D2&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Telephone follow-up by the interviewer on the day and filling in the questionnaire - if&#xD;
           the patient is not available on day 3, the patient will be recalled on day 4 and the&#xD;
           data extrapolated according to the slope of the curve between D1 and D4; if the patient&#xD;
           is not available at D4, he will be recalled to D5 and the extrapolated data between D1&#xD;
           and D5.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Telephone follow-up on the interviewer's day and fill in the questionnaire in case of&#xD;
           non-availability of the patient on day 7, the patient will be recalled to D8 and the&#xD;
           data extrapolated according to the slope of the curve between D3 and D8; if the patient&#xD;
           is still not available on D8, he will be recalled to D9 and the extrapolated data&#xD;
           between D3 and D9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.STATISTICAL ASPECTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.1. Statistical justification for the sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      58,921 patients were received in emergency consultation day and night during the year 2017. A&#xD;
      sample of 1% of the population concerned will be constituted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients received in day emergencies (44,191 patients in 2017) will be eligible. On average&#xD;
      121 patients are received daily in emergencies of day, about 600 per week (excluding&#xD;
      weekend).&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to a previous study in the department, 50% of patients in care could not be&#xD;
      included in the study or were lost to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This leads to a number of 300 patients per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will therefore be conduct over 2 weeks, to include 600 patients, ie 1.3% of the&#xD;
      population consulting&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.2. Description of statistical methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      A descriptive analysis of the characteristics of the sample will be performed (age, sex,&#xD;
      reason for consultation, diagnosis, prior appointment test, average score of anxiety and pain&#xD;
      scores on D0, D1, D3, D7, compliance with instructions and making follow-up appointments,),&#xD;
      satisfaction rating, appreciation of the quality of medical care, politeness of staff,&#xD;
      waiting time, assessment of the quality of the care setting, the information received, the&#xD;
      treatment received, and the recommendation of the service to third parties will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An analysis of the evolution of pain and anxiety scores between D0, D1, D3 and D7 will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlations between the type of treatment and the perceived pain as well as the type of&#xD;
      treatment and the perceived anxiety will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.3. Method of taking into account missing or invalid data&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients unreachable during the telephone follow-up period will be contacted the next day;&#xD;
      the pain and anxiety scores will then be extrapolated from the previous data and the new data&#xD;
      collected, by calculating the nearest point on the curve connecting these two data. If they&#xD;
      are new unreachable, the data will be considered missing. Data from patients with missing&#xD;
      data will be analyzed separately.&#xD;
