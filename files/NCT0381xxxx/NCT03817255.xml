  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Excessive alcohol and other substance use in adolescence is prevalent and has&#xD;
      developmental consequences that extend into adulthood. In parallel with other public health&#xD;
      and clinical measures, early identification in primary care represents an important step to&#xD;
      address this problem. Screening and brief intervention by primary care physicians is&#xD;
      recommended but often fails to be implemented due to time constraints and other barriers.&#xD;
      Working hypothesis: Recent evidence suggests that simply asking individuals about their&#xD;
      substance use may in itself encourage behaviour change, regardless of the clinical&#xD;
      intervention that may follow. This hypothesis has not as yet been tested in a population of&#xD;
      young people consulting in primary care. The investigators hypothesise that inviting young&#xD;
      people to complete a brief substance use screening questionnaire in the waiting room before&#xD;
      their primary care consultation has the potential to lead to a decrease in substance use in&#xD;
      the months following this consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims: The aim of this pilot project is to develop and test the methods for a future&#xD;
      randomized trial. The future trial will assess the effectiveness of pre-consultation&#xD;
      substance use screening, compared to screening for other behaviors, on subsequent substance&#xD;
      use in young people between the ages of 15 and 24 years consulting primary care physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected value of the proposed project: The clinical context of primary care has the&#xD;
      potential to trigger behavior change in young people, thus favoring improved adult outcomes&#xD;
      in this population. If effective, pre-consultation substance use screening could contribute&#xD;
      to a reduction in excessive substance use among young people in a simple and cost-effective&#xD;
      way. This pilot study will provide precious feasibility data for the design of the related&#xD;
      cluster randomised trial.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Excessive alcohol and other substance use in adolescence has short and long term consequences&#xD;
      on health and contributes extensively to lifelong morbidity. Since prevalence of this&#xD;
      excessive use is high among young people consulting in primary care, primary care physicians&#xD;
      (PCPs) are well placed to address this problem. PCPs are encouraged to screen and provide&#xD;
      brief interventions addressing excessive substance use in young people, but a range of&#xD;
      barriers, such as time constraints and insufficient training, limits the implementation of&#xD;
      these recommendations in primary care practices. Several recent trials of brief primary care&#xD;
      interventions showed substantial reductions in the proportion of participants who were&#xD;
      excessive substance users at follow-up (20% to 30% reductions), but no statistically&#xD;
      significant differences between the intervention and control groups. Reductions in substance&#xD;
      use in the control group can be due to several factors: 1) Regression to the mean (repeat&#xD;
      participant responses show a trend towards the mean values for the participating population),&#xD;
      2) Research participation effects (e.g. Hawthorne effect, social desirability bias), 3)&#xD;
      Historical trends which affect the entire population, such as reductions in per capita&#xD;
      alcohol use in relation to public health measures, 4) Assessment reactivity, when&#xD;
      pre-intervention assessment itself encourages behavior change and thus serves as an&#xD;
      intervention. In a randomized design these factors should apply equally to both groups, and&#xD;
      additional effects of the tested intervention may still be visible. If reductions in&#xD;
      substance use at follow-up are due to assessment reactivity, this suggests screening in the&#xD;
      clinical context could act as an intervention in itself and be as effective as a brief&#xD;
      intervention within the consultation. To date this hypothesis has not been explored in a&#xD;
      population of young people attending primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the Trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the effectiveness of simply screening participants for excessive substance use&#xD;
      before the consultation in the waiting room in reducing the prevalence of excessive substance&#xD;
      use in young people attending primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the pilot study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To pilot all methods for a randomized trial of the substance use screening intervention&#xD;
           (patient recruitment, intervention and control conditions, follow-up procedures),&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To obtain feedback from PCPs and patients in relation to the feasibility and&#xD;
           acceptability of the proposed methods for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention screening questionnaire will be based on an instrument developed for&#xD;
      previous trials. Questions for the control condition (about physical activity) will be based&#xD;
      on a validated physical activity questionnaire (International Physical Activity&#xD;
      Questionnaire, IPAQ). As recommended in guidelines for adolescent health and primary care&#xD;
      research, both young people and PCPs will be involved in the development of the screening&#xD;
      tools. A reference group of young people and of PCPs will be established in order to benefit&#xD;
      from their input into the design of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intended trial procedure including recruitment of young people, screening for health risk&#xD;
      behaviours and follow-up will be piloted in 6 primary care practices in the canton of Geneva&#xD;
      in order to inform the final design of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physicians involved in the advisory-group will be invited to undertake the pilot study in&#xD;
      their own practices. They will be asked to include a minimum of five patients each. Patients&#xD;
      will be randomized to either the intervention or the control questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited using a similar procedure as the one developed for one of our&#xD;
      previous studies, the PRISM-Ado trial. Prior to the consultation, eligible patients will be&#xD;
      invited by the practice assistant to participate in the study. Participants will be given an&#xD;
      information and consent form, and will be given the choice to complete the study&#xD;
      questionnaire either online (using a QR code to access the questionnaire on their phone) or&#xD;
      in a paper format, in the waiting room. Participants will be asked to provide a contact phone&#xD;
      number (mobile phone) to allow follow-up assessments 1 month following the consultation.&#xD;
      Young people involved in the PRISM-Ado study underlined that they would be less likely to&#xD;
      respond honestly to a screening questionnaire if it were to be used by the doctor in the&#xD;
      consultation. Therefore this pre-consultation questionnaire will be entirely anonymous and&#xD;
      will not be available for the PCPs to help them identify at-risk consumers. Written informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained from all young people before they complete the screening survey.&#xD;
      Patient questionnaires will be coded to ensure anonymity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A meeting of participating doctors will be organized to receive feed-back on all aspects of&#xD;
      the study. Participating patients will be asked to provide their contact details (mobile&#xD;
      phone number) so that they may be contacted to provide feed-back on the screening&#xD;
      questionnaire and study procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physicians' and young people's characteristics will be summarized using frequencies for&#xD;
      categorical data and means and standard deviations for continuous data. This summary will&#xD;
      provide us with an initial profile of youth consulting in the practices and will inform&#xD;
      planning and sample size calculations for the randomized trial. Participant feed-back will be&#xD;
      summarized in a qualitative way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance of the expected results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this pilot study will provide precious information for the final design of the&#xD;
      randomised trial in primary care. These results will be published in a medical journal and&#xD;
      presented at medical conferences. The consequences of excessive substance use in adolescence&#xD;
      extend into adulthood. The investigators are hopeful that the interventions developed and&#xD;
      piloted in this project will provide new ways of ensuring better health for young people&#xD;
      today and in the future.&#xD;

    <measure>The number of patients recruited by each PCP within a 2-month period</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>A maximum of 10 patients were to be recruited by each of the 6 participating primary care physicians (PCPs) within a 2-month period. The target number was 5 patients per PCP, but the recruitment period was not prolonged if this target was not met.</description>

    <measure>The proportion of PCPs who recruited at least 5 patients within a 2-month period</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The participating PCPs were asked to recruit a minimum of 5 patients, but the recruitment period was limited to 2 months (for practical and financial reasons). All participating PCPs participated in the pilot study thinking that they would be able to recruit 5 patients. This outcome thus gives us an idea about whether PCPs had a realistic idea about their ability to recruit a sufficient number of eligible patients.</description>

    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Each PCP received a unique randomized sequence of intervention and control questionnaires, in envelopes numbered from 1 to 10. At the end of the two-month recruitment period, they returned all envelopes (completed and empty questionnaires). The research team checked whether the sequence from 1 to 10 had been respected.</description>
