  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiogenic shock (CGS) affects up to 10% of patients suffering acute coronary syndrome. It&#xD;
      has a 30 day mortality of 45-50%. No pharmacological nor intervention/device trials have had&#xD;
      any impact on this mortality in the last 20 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EURO SHOCK Trial (supported by the European Union Horizons 2020 programme) will randomise&#xD;
      428 patients with CGS following acute coronary syndrome from 44 EU centres to early&#xD;
      intervention with Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) therapy or to standard&#xD;
      treatment (with no ECMO). This intervention is a high cost specialist centre procedure that&#xD;
      warrants further investigation including economic appraisal. Multiple mechanistic and&#xD;
      hypothesis generating sub-studies will be undertaken.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The EURO SHOCK trial tests the novel use of early deployment of mechanical support device in&#xD;
      Cardiogenic Shock (CGS) in a randomised, strategy trial, with evidence of benefit or&#xD;
      otherwise measured by recording hard clinical end-point outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is already used in CGS. This is therefore not a&#xD;
      novel therapy. It is the use of ECMO early in the development of CGS that is the novel aspect&#xD;
      of this project. The Investigators will test whether a strategy of very early ECMO can&#xD;
      ameliorate the rapid decline that many CGS patients suffer. The value of deploying a&#xD;
      clinically used and approved device prospectively and early in the natural history of CGS&#xD;
      compared to standard practice has not been tested before and will be the basis of the EURO&#xD;
      SHOCK project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial itself will be a prospective randomized, open label, design study that will&#xD;
      compare two groups of patients: Both will receive appropriate percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention (PCI) as is current practice as they arrive at the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group 1 will receive immediate PCI + standard care (pharmacological support).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group 2 will receive immediate PCI plus support with early peripheral veno-arterial ECMO&#xD;
           + standard care (pharmacological support).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators will also compare the cost-effectiveness of early VA-ECMO, as compared to&#xD;
      current standard of care. EURO SHOCK will also evaluate novel CMR protocols in these unwell&#xD;
      patients, and also whether systems of urgent flagged transfer of the unwell patient is&#xD;
      practical and beneficial. The Investigators will determine whether there are biological and&#xD;
      ECG markers that predict worse patient outcomes, which could thus help select most&#xD;
      appropriate patients for expedited treatments (the patient is only transferred if needed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although at the centre of the project there is a randomised trial, other important objectives&#xD;
      will therefore be delivered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study will additionally focus, through a-priori, post-hoc analyses, on higher&#xD;
      risk and vulnerable sub groups such as the elderly (&gt;75 years) and females, the importance of&#xD;
      site of infarct and on those with multi-morbidities such as diabetes. These post-hoc data&#xD;
      will be published separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will include patients with out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) who have&#xD;
      documented return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) but with certain caveats (see exclusion&#xD;
      criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the all-cause mortality at 30 days following admission with acute&#xD;
      coronary syndrome with cardiogenic shock. Key secondary outcomes will include all- cause&#xD;
      mortality or admission with heart failure at 12 months, all-cause mortality at 12 months and&#xD;
      admission to hospital with heart failure at 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cornerstone of this research programme will be to determine the cost-efficacy of ECMO in&#xD;
      this setting. Cost benefit will be measured both immediately and in the longer term testing&#xD;
      for example any impact of need for heart failure therapies. This will be undertaken with&#xD;
      evaluations of the cost-effectiveness of the device and evaluation of quality of life using&#xD;
      the EuroQuol-5D-5L and the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EUROSHOCK trial will also include the following sub-studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cardiovascular MRI: Cardio-Renal Imaging Sub-study using novel shortened,&#xD;
           non-breath-holding protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Platelet Function Sub-study designed to access the impact of novel ECMO coatings on&#xD;
           platelet activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The programme will be developed and run through a carefully thought through management&#xD;
      structure comprising 8 separate but interlinked work programmes (each targeted at one aspect&#xD;
      of the project and headed by an experienced clinical trialist or trial manager) and involve&#xD;
      the dissemination of results through a designated dissemination work package. Attention to&#xD;
      translating the results to subsequent on-the-ground patient care will be an important aim for&#xD;
      the management and dissemination team, and will involve patient support groups, professional&#xD;
      societies and information delivered directly to the medical and non- medical staff caring for&#xD;
      CGS patients.&#xD;

The EuroQuol (EQ)-5D-5L questionnaire assesses quality of life in study participants according to 5 domains (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) each scored according to a scale of 1 (no problems) to 5 (indicating extreme problems) and generating a 5-digit code corresponding to quality of life.
