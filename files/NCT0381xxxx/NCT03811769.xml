  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke represents the fourth leading cause of death in industrialized nations, after heart&#xD;
      disease, cancer, and chronic lower respiratory disease. The overall burden of stroke will&#xD;
      rise dramatically in the next 20 years due to an ageing population. Approximately one-quarter&#xD;
      of the patients suffering a stroke die within one year after the initial event and stroke is&#xD;
      a leading cause of serious long-term disability. Although mechanical thrombectomy (MT) has&#xD;
      become the standard of care for acute ischemic stroke with proximal large vessel occlusion&#xD;
      (LVO) in the anterior circulation, the management of patients harboring proximal occlusion&#xD;
      but presenting minor-to-mild stroke symptoms, has not yet been determined by these recent&#xD;
      randomized clinical trials. However, patients with proximal occlusions may present with a low&#xD;
      National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) 10, a proximal intraarterial occlusion&#xD;
      being present in up to 28% when considering patients with an NIHSS ≤ 411. In observational&#xD;
      study, patient with minor or mild stroke symptoms and LVO have a high risk of both clinical&#xD;
      worsening and bad outcome. The STAIR (Stroke Treatment Academic Industry Roundtable) meeting&#xD;
      aims to advance acute stroke therapy development through collaboration between academia,&#xD;
      industry, and regulatory institutions13. In pursuit of this goal and building on the&#xD;
      available level I evidence of benefit from endovascular therapy (EVT) in large vessel&#xD;
      occlusion stroke, STAIR IX consensus recommendations were developed that outline priorities&#xD;
      for future research in EVT.&#xD;

      The LASTE hypothesis is that patient harbouring a large ischemic core stroke at presentation,&#xD;
      may still benefit from mechanical thrombectomy, given the very poor natural history of&#xD;
      patient managed by a standalone medical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The threshold of ASPECTS 5 to set a benefit for treatment was inspired by initial large&#xD;
      medical trials using IV t-PA25-27 (Samurai-CT ALBERTA Score IV cohort). In the paradigm of&#xD;
      acute and complete reperfusion, radiographic infarct stroke volume may be partially&#xD;
      reversible and thus the resulting final infarct may be smaller compared to the one in&#xD;
      non-re-perfused patients who will consequently have poorer clinical outcomes. By now, large&#xD;
      core patients defined as ASPECTS 0-5 were excluded from most randomized clinical trials&#xD;
      resulting in a lack of unequivocal evidence of benefit in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses of several prospective cohorts suggest signals of benefit in favor of thrombectomy&#xD;
      in patients with large baseline core. In the prospective cohort ETIS, LAPERGUE et al reported&#xD;
      a rate of good outcome of 34% in the subgroup of patient with ASPECT 4-5. In the prospective&#xD;
      cohort analysis RECOST, a mean mRS score of 34% in a group of patient presenting ASPECT 0-5&#xD;
      treated with mechanical thrombectomy, versus 9% of good outcome in the medical group,&#xD;
      suggesting a benefit to treat LVO harbouring a large core. The strongest argument in favor of&#xD;
      benefit of EVT even in patients with large core is provided by the six completed randomized&#xD;
      endovascular stroke trials. These trials did prove that Combined Approach Mechanical + IV&#xD;
      t-PA, is superior to standalone IV lytics, mRs score ≤ 2 ranging from 33% and up to 72%, but&#xD;
      Large Core Infarction were largely excluded. Nonetheless a pooled analysis of these trials&#xD;
      revealed that a minority of patients with large baseline core were still randomized. In MR&#xD;
      CLEAN study, despite no exclusion criteria defined in the initial protocol, the median ASPECT&#xD;
      score of the cohort was 9 out of 10. In SWIFT-PRIME study, the mean ASPECT score of the&#xD;
      cohort was 7, and in REVASCAT study it was 6.8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LASTE protocol &quot;Large Stroke Therapy Evaluation&quot; aims to study the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      mechanical thrombectomy in the acute phase of cerebral infarction less than 7 hours for&#xD;
      patients with a large volume of necrosis defined by a score ASPECT from 0 to 5. The patients&#xD;
      will be followed 6 months after the stroke.&#xD;
