  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Over the past decade, the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for&#xD;
      respiratory support in adults has increased. Several trials have highlighted how red blood&#xD;
      cells transfusion can cause several negative effects and, currently, a restrictive&#xD;
      transfusion trigger in critically ill patients is widely accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The optimal management of anticoagulation targets and transfusion practice in&#xD;
      veno-venous-ECMO (VV-ECMO) patients is still under debate. Traditionally, the threshold for&#xD;
      transfusions of packed red blood cells (PRBC) in ECMO is aimed at keeping hemoglobin (Hb)&#xD;
      values in the normal range (12-14 g/dL), but some case series have shown how the Hb target&#xD;
      can be lower, and with comparable clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While there are extensive reviews on predicted ECMO survival, and management (even with many&#xD;
      debated issues), there is a significant knowledge gap in understanding the benefits and risks&#xD;
      of transfusions during VV-ECMO Methods/Design: Prospective observational multicenter study.&#xD;
      The principal aim is to describe current effective blood product usage, during VV-ECMO. The&#xD;
      secondary aim is to describe in a large cohort of ECMO patients the current anticoagulation&#xD;
      strategy and bleeding episodes occurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at a multicenter level including in each center all consecutive&#xD;
      adult vv-ECMO patients during one year up. The data collection will include pre-ECMO&#xD;
      characteristics, transfusion strategies and blood test results during the first twenty-eight&#xD;
      days after ECMO cannulation or until the end of ECMO support if the length is shorter, and&#xD;
      clinical outcomes up to the end of ICU stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The descriptive variable end points for the primary aim will be the daily and the total&#xD;
      amount of PRBC and other blood products (Plasma, Platelets, Fibrinogen, Antithrombin III).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The descriptive variable end points for the secondary aim will be the type and dose of&#xD;
      anticoagulation, and episodes of bleeding according to site and severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Results: A collaborative combination of ECMO centers will evaluate prospective data&#xD;
      of transfusion practices during ECMO. The investigators would be able to describe the&#xD;
      currently strategy for administration of blood products, anticoagulation and the effective&#xD;
      incidence of bleeding episodes worldwide.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background Over the past decade, the use of extracorporeal Membrane Oxygnation (ECMO) for&#xD;
      respiratory support in adults has vastly increased. Veno-venous ECMO (VV-ECMO) can be&#xD;
      initiated in case of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) as salvage therapy for&#xD;
      patients with profound gas exchange abnormalities despite protective lung ventilation and&#xD;
      other rescue therapies. Many aspects of ECMO management are still under debate despite the&#xD;
      increasing number of cases. Among these debated topics there is certainly the optimal&#xD;
      management of transfusion practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several trials have recognized how red blood cells transfusion can cause several negative&#xD;
      effects, including transfusion related immune reactions, the potential transmission of&#xD;
      diseases, the development of transfusion-related complications (such as transfusion-related&#xD;
      acute lung injury - TRALI - or transfusion-associated circulatory overload - TACO) and&#xD;
      immunosuppression. On the other hand, anemia can also cause a potential increase in morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality in critically ill patients, and in ECMO is an even greater critical issue in&#xD;
      reducing delivery of oxygen (DO2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, despite improvement in technology and care, complications related to ECMO are still&#xD;
      high, and frequently involve an imbalance in the coagulation status due to anticoagulant use&#xD;
      in the presence of coagulopathy. Consequently, the risk of thrombosis (presumably&#xD;
      microthrombosis) and hemorrhage remain to be high. In the case of ongoing bleeding,&#xD;
      transfusion of Packed Red Blood Cell (PRBC) is required to support desired haemoglobin&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, the threshold for PRBC transfusions in ECMO is aimed to maintain hemoglobin&#xD;
      (Hb) values in the normal range (12-14 g/dL). Despite this, there is considerable uncertainty&#xD;
      regarding the optimal haemoglobin threshold for the use of PRBC transfusions in anemic&#xD;
      patients during ECMO support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prompted by the general reappraisal of PRBC transfusion use, some case series using lower&#xD;
      target for Hb during vv-ECMO support have been published. However, such protocols do not&#xD;
      use/suggest a definitive trigger/target of Hb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is also some evidence that a higher number of transfusions in ECMO patients is&#xD;
      associated with worse outcomes. However, such a relationship is difficult to assess given the&#xD;
      large number of factors influencing transfusion practice in this setting: target of&#xD;
      anticoagulation, frequent bleeding episodes, the peculiar characteristics of the circuits&#xD;
      that can cause mechanical damage, activation of inflammation, and consumption of platelet and&#xD;
      coagulation factors, to name but a few.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, most of the available data on transfusions during ECMO are heterogeneous, usually&#xD;
      including VV-ECMO and veno-arterial-ECMO (VA-ECMO) configuration, and mixing adults with&#xD;
      neonatal and pediatric cohorts, which are historically more represented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the decision of giving a transfusion during ECMO support is still a real&#xD;
      challenge since several parameters have to be taken into account at the same time. A strict&#xD;
      trigger has not yet been defined in this population, and the literature on critically ill&#xD;
      patients suggests a relevant reduction in the amount of transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for the study Providing adequate DO2 can be approached in several ways during&#xD;
      vv-ECMO support, but the hemoglobin target is always a critical point, and a relevant piece&#xD;
      of the puzzle of assuring the best oxygenation in patients affected with acute respiratory&#xD;
      failure (ARF). There may be important variations between hospitals and countries in the use&#xD;
      of PRBC transfusions, which may impact patient outcome. Large scale, national, and&#xD;
      international studies are currently lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a significant knowledge gap in understanding the benefits and risks of transfusion&#xD;
      during VV-ECMO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An international multicenter study will evaluate prospective observational data of&#xD;
      transfusion practices during VV-ECMO, analyzing it in light of anticoagulation and bleeding&#xD;
      episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study The PROTECMO study is aimed at being a collaborative study including a large&#xD;
      number of ECMO centers worldwide, describing, in real practice,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Incidence of major bleeding events and amount of blood product transfused&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Type, trigger and level of anticoagulation adopted&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: international multicenter prospective observational cohort study. For the&#xD;
      primary outcome PRBC will be evaluated as total amount during the ECMO run and in the first&#xD;
      28 days also as daily amount. The total amount of PRBC, adjusted for the ECMO length of stay,&#xD;
      will be evaluated in light of pre-ECMO parameters (age, comorbidities, postoperative state&#xD;
      and severity scores) and of daily data (bleeding episodes, ECMO blood flow, dieresis, CRRT,&#xD;
      Hb, major events). Daily occurrence of PRBC transfusion will be described according to&#xD;
      pre-ECMO characteristics and daily parameters (Hb, bleeding, hemodynamics, renal function,&#xD;
      circuit change).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma, platelets, Fibrinogen, Antithrombin III administration will be evaluated according to&#xD;
      pre-ECMO data and according to daily APTT level (or other coagulation monitoring adopted),&#xD;
      bleeding episodes, sepsis occurred For the secondary outcomes type of anticoagulant will be&#xD;
      described as well as daily dose and daily target for the parameter targeted (APTT, ACT,&#xD;
      r-TEG, anti-Xa according to local protocol). Anticoagulation will be described in relation to&#xD;
      pre-ECMO parameters and daily episodes of bleeding and occurrence of sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bleeding episodes will be described according to site (airway - including tracheotomy -&#xD;
      oro-nasal, gastric, intrathoracic, abdominal, intestinal, retroperitoneal, urinary tract,&#xD;
      other) and classified according to severity following 5 adjusted categories of the Bleeding&#xD;
      Academic Research Consortium (BARC) score: Type 0, no bleeding; Type 1, Any overt bleeding&#xD;
      that requires heparin infusion rate reduction or PRBC transfusion (provided Hb drop was&#xD;
      related to bleeding); Type 2, any overt bleeding that requires heparin infusion rate&#xD;
      reduction and packed red blood cells transfusion or non-surgical procedure to stop bleeding&#xD;
      (provided Hb drop was related to bleeding); Type 3, Any life-threatening bleeding that&#xD;
      required PRBC transfusion and surgical intervention for control of bleeding or ECMO&#xD;
      discontinuation; Type 4: any fatal bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every patient included will be registered for baseline values, and will then be followed for&#xD;
      ECMO management and transfusion management daily for the first 28 days or until ECMO weaning&#xD;
      if the ECMO run will be shorter than the observation time. Daily parameters will be recorded.&#xD;
      Moreover, data will be recorded for every PRBC, Plasma, Platelets transfusion event. The&#xD;
      patients will be observed for the clinical outcomes until they are discharged from the ICU&#xD;
      and 6-months mortality will be recorded. Considering that according the Extracorporeal Life&#xD;
      Support Organization summary, the average length of respiratory ECMO run is about 12 days we&#xD;
      believe that the majority of ECMO run will be fully covered by the observation period and, at&#xD;
      least, it will be paradigmatic of a center's actual practice and, at the same time, will&#xD;
      assure a considerable sample size of transfusion events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be reported according to the STROBE (Strengthening the reporting of observational&#xD;
      studies in epidemiology) statement checklist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study conduction Given the explorative nature of this study, the required number of patients&#xD;
      was not calculated, but considering at least 10 patients/year for each center (considered the&#xD;
      worst prediction) we imagine that the included patients will be at least 100 in Italy and we&#xD;
      presume to enroll at least a double number worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transfusions decisions for each patient will be recorded daily for 28 days after ECMO&#xD;
           cannulation or until the end of ECMO support if the length is &lt; 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be observed until ICU discharge with a follow up to sixth months for&#xD;
           mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The inclusion period will be 12 months for each center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection methods Data will be recorded using pre-printed CRF by the principal&#xD;
      investigator (PI) in each center or directly they will be recorded online. All data will be&#xD;
      reported in a centralized online and Web-based fully encrypted database (REDCAP)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will include clinical characteristics: baseline demographics, basic biological values&#xD;
      (e.g., blood gas, hemoglobin), primary diagnosis, comorbidities, underlying etiology of acute&#xD;
      respiratory failure, severity of illness (e.g., SOFA, SAPS 2), type of ECMO, and the size of&#xD;
      the cannulas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECMO management data will be collected daily for 28 days. Additionally, fluid balance,&#xD;
      adverse events, Hb and all hematological data, anticoagulation management and monitoring will&#xD;
      be collected every 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For 28 days, transfusion amounts and values of Hb, HTC, Platelets, will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bleeding will be evaluated according to site and severity according to 5 adjusted categories&#xD;
      of the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will also be collected for the duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of ECMO, and&#xD;
      ICU length of stay. Clinical outcome assessment will be made, with date of death, ICU&#xD;
      discharge, hospital discharge, sixth month mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Descriptive statistics including frequency (percentage), median and&#xD;
      interquartile range (IQR) will describe overall population and groups of survivors and&#xD;
      non-survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to describe current transfusion practice the amount of PRBC, Plasma and Platelets,&#xD;
      will be described as units and ml and as a number of transfusions adjusted for ECMO length of&#xD;
      stay and considering the concomitant bleeding episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fibrinogen and Antithrombin III will be described as mg or units respectively and as a number&#xD;
      of administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticoagulation will be reported as type, mean dosage and the confidence interval (CI 95%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hb average level and the confidence interval (CI 95%) will be reported. Baseline categorical&#xD;
      and continuous variables will be compared for transfusion and ECMO weaning groups. In&#xD;
      particular categorical variables will be compared with chi-square tests and continuous&#xD;
      variables will be compared with Student's T-test, or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, otherwise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple COX regression analysis will be used in order to explore the impact of confounding&#xD;
      factors such as baseline patient severity, ECMO length of stay, bleeding episodes and&#xD;
      possible others covariates and factors that will be observed and raised relevance during the&#xD;
      first exploratory or univariate analysis. The impact of relevant confounding factors such as&#xD;
      length of ECMO run, pre-ECMO severity scores, pre-ECMO administration of transfusions will be&#xD;
      analyzed separately and together in multiple analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular daily RBC transfusion will be studied according to the association to renal&#xD;
      function, fluid balance, worst Hb level, episodes of bleeding, use of vasopressors, ECMO&#xD;
      blood flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A p-value less of than 0.05 will be considered significant. Data handling and analyses will&#xD;
      be done with SAS 9.4 software (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA) and R 3.3 software (R&#xD;
      Foundation for Statistical Computing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics: Informed Consent and Treatment of personal data The study will be conducted in&#xD;
      compliance with the current Helsinki Declaration and the standards of good clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves the enrollment of patients undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation&#xD;
      support and therefore unable to express a consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every participating center will have to ask the permission to their Ethic Committee or other&#xD;
      relevant and competent authorities according to the local rules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At ISMETT, according the Italian rules (and we strongly suggest to follow the same at the&#xD;
      other centers), the investigators will apply the following practice about informed consent as&#xD;
      it was approved by the Ethic Committee. The participating centers will be supperted with&#xD;
      approval by ISMETT Ethic Committee and providing materials and translated informed consent&#xD;
      either for the participation in the study and for the data protection policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the art. 82 of the Codice Privacy the investigators will ask for a consent for&#xD;
      the treatment of personal data of the patients that for the particular support of the ECMO&#xD;
      are almost always sedated at least at the beginning of the ECMO run - so they have to be&#xD;
      considered temporarily unable to express a consent - to those that have legal authority over&#xD;
      them or to the immediate relatives or to a person cohabiting with them or - failing these -&#xD;
      to the person in charge of the facility where the data subject is hosted. In case the patient&#xD;
      is able to an informed consent it will be asked to himself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of following improvement of neurological condition of the patient we will ask for&#xD;
      a consent directly to the patient as soon as we will consider him again able to express a&#xD;
      valid consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the research will be diffused as aggregate data and in ways that will not&#xD;
      allow in any case the identification of the enrolled patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety The present study, giving its observational design, has a complete safety profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no additional interventions or measurements other than those that are standard&#xD;
      of care at the participating center. All clinical activity will follow the well established&#xD;
      protocols for ECMO support at each participating center and consequently the patients are at&#xD;
      no risk by in participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predefined subgroup analyses If the sample size will be adequate, as explorative analyses,&#xD;
      some subgroup analyses will be performed according to the following predefined plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory analyses will stratify data for center workload (&lt;10, 10-20, &gt;20 ECMO run per&#xD;
      year), according to geographical areas (we imagine a stratification among continents but we&#xD;
      will verify if, giving the amount of data, will be reasonable a country stratification), and&#xD;
      for pre-ECMO severity scores (Preserve score and Respscore) divided in quartiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, by the repeated measurements of hemoglobin and eventual transfusion event, for each&#xD;
      center we will profile the actual and effective hemoglobin accepted as a trigger. The outcome&#xD;
      weaning from ECMO and effective ICU discharge will be stratified also according to different&#xD;
      hemoglobin values (&lt;7, 7-10, &gt;10, &gt;12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another subgroups analysis will involve age, considered a major impacting factor in survival&#xD;
      during ECMO. Patients will be divided in quartiles and patients &gt; 60 years old will moreover&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Jehovah's witnesses and all patients refusing transfusions for personal reasons, as well as&#xD;
      patients affected with hematological malignances will be analyzed separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results, potential benefit of the study and publication program A collaborative&#xD;
      combination of ECMO centers will evaluate prospective data of transfusion practices during&#xD;
      ECMO. The investigators would be able to describe the currently strategy for administration&#xD;
      of blood products, anticoagulation and the effective incidence of bleeding episodes&#xD;
      worldwide.&#xD;
