      In Singapore, the current cervical cancer screening uptake among women in Singapore has&#xD;
      remained at low 50% since its introduction in 2004. It has been widely reported that&#xD;
      under-screened women have the highest risk of cervical cancer. Self-sampling HPV DNA&#xD;
      screening may be a solution to the low uptake rates of local women, particularly among the&#xD;
      under-screened population in Singapore. Self-sampling comprises women using a swab to obtain&#xD;
      samples from their vagina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we are comparing the sensitivity of detecting HPV positive women using HPV DNA&#xD;
      test with self-sampling using flocked swab with the current physician sampling method. We&#xD;
      also aim to determine acceptability of self-sampling HPV DNA test using flocked swab in&#xD;
      cervical cancer screening. Designed as a feasibility study, it will comprise a prospective&#xD;
      study of 300 women attending clinics in National University Hospital (NUH) and National&#xD;
      Cancer Institute Singapore (NCIS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. The recognition that&#xD;
      cervical cancer is caused by persistent oncogenic HPV virus has caused a considerable&#xD;
      paradigm shift in screening and prevention of cervical cancer by the introduction of HPV DNA&#xD;
      test and the HPV vaccine. HPV DNA test as an alternative to the current and more traditional&#xD;
      cytology only screening has been shown to have higher sensitivity in detecting high grade&#xD;
      cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) to allow for earlier treatment of pre-cancer thus&#xD;
      preventing development of cervical cancer in future. Singapore as the rest of the world are&#xD;
      in the transition toward the paradigm shift of using HPV DNA test as part of the cervical&#xD;
      cancer screening strategy compared to the traditional cytology only screening. However, any&#xD;
      cancer screening program to make an impact, an uptake of 70% of more is desired and currently&#xD;
      this strategy resulting to the reduction in cervical cancer incidence are only seen in&#xD;
      countries adopting an organized cervical cancer screening strategy such as the United&#xD;
      Kingdom. Currently, HPV DNA testing has widely been shown to be higher sensitivity to pick up&#xD;
      pre-cancer and allow for earlier treatment of pre-cancer. Uptake for cervical cancer&#xD;
      screening has remains suboptimal since introduction of the national cervical cancer screening&#xD;
      using cytology only method in 2004.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study published by Jin et.al. in Singapore Medical Journal in 2013 evaluating the progress&#xD;
      of cervical cancer screening Singapore (CSS) since its introduction showed that CSS did not&#xD;
      make its aim to get 80% uptake for cervical cancer screening for eligible women using&#xD;
      cytology only method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-sampling in cervical cancer screening&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cervical cancer screening with HPV DNA test is more sensitive than cytology only method to&#xD;
      detect pre-cancer cervical cells. It is now well established that cervical cancer screening&#xD;
      with HPV DNA test is a much more sensitive method to detect pre-cancer cervical cells&#xD;
      compared to cytology only method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The traditional way of taking a cervical cancer screening involves a physician inserting a&#xD;
      speculum into the vagina to visualize the cervix and brushing the surface of the cervix using&#xD;
      a cytology brush or spatula. This will collect exfoliated cervical cells to be sent for&#xD;
      cytology review to detect any abnormal or pre-cancerous looking cells. Currently HPV DNA test&#xD;
      is performed using the same method as taking a pap smear. However, various studies have shown&#xD;
      that for HPV DNA test, self-sampling method is a good alternative to physician sampling&#xD;
      (Appendix C). Current self-sampling methods in the market are expensive and not cost&#xD;
      effective especially if targeting under screeners. There are however, various self-sampling&#xD;
      HPV DNA test device in the market. These devices such as the Delphi Screener are expensive&#xD;
      and would not be a cost-effective alternative method for women especially in the under&#xD;
      screeners in Singapore. Studies have shown that those who do not come for regular cervical&#xD;
      cancer screening are usually associated with a lower socioeconomic background. To encourage&#xD;
      the under screeners to take up screening, the method should not only be accessible to them&#xD;
      but also affordable. The Copan Floq swab has already been used in NUH for Chlamydia testing&#xD;
      and it is highly affordable at 3 SGD per swab. Our study would like to determine that using&#xD;
      this affordable swab for self-sampling is as sensitive in detecting high risk HPV as a&#xD;
      physician sampling method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no local data on the acceptability of self-sampling method using a Floq swab among&#xD;
      women in Singapore. The acceptability of self-sampling has been reported to be high among&#xD;
      women especially in the western countries. Women in the Asian population in particular&#xD;
      Singapore may differ in their acceptability of a self-sampling method compared to a physician&#xD;
      sampling method. Self-sampling HPV DNA test will require a woman to insert the cotton swab&#xD;
      into the vagina and currently there is no local data to show wether it is an acceptable&#xD;
      method for women in Singapore for all ages from 25 to 69 years old. The use of tampons is a&#xD;
      much more acceptable method during menstruation in the western country which may influence&#xD;
      the acceptability data of self-sampling in the western countries. However, tampon use is not&#xD;
      a norm in Asian population including Singapore and may be a factor to influence the&#xD;
      acceptability of self-sampling among Singaporean women especially in the older age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is thus also designed to elucidate this issue. Cervical cancer is a marker of&#xD;
      health disparities. Looking to the future, data has shown that failure to go for cervical&#xD;
      cancer screening, which is a highly preventable disease, may also be linked to failure of&#xD;
      uptake to other screening in a woman. It may also be linked to failure of basic health&#xD;
      screening not only for the woman but also for her family. Hence to overcome barriers for&#xD;
      cervical cancer screening especially in giving women a reliable alternative option may in&#xD;
      future not only help to prevent cervical cancer but also indirectly encourage uptake of other&#xD;
      screening such as breast cancer and colorectal screening for her and her family. Our study&#xD;
      will attempt to address two questions. 1) Does the self-sampling HPV DNA test as sensitive as&#xD;
      the physician sampling HPV DNA test in Singapore? And 2) If Singaporean women have the option&#xD;
      of self-sampling, are they more likely to regularly participate in future cervical cancer&#xD;
      screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a prospective feasibility study composed of healthy women aged between 30-69&#xD;
      years who are attending clinics in NUH will be identified through the gynaecologist. Ethical&#xD;
      approval for this study from the Domain Specific Review Board for O&amp;G is being sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Three hundred women who meet the inclusion &amp; exclusion below will be invited to&#xD;
      participate and complete the consent process. Those that decline will have age, ethnicity,&#xD;
      education, work status &amp; reason for declining collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit: Each potential participant will initially see their doctor as clinically&#xD;
      intended and offered to participate in the study as identified by each physician in the&#xD;
      clinic. Upon agreeing to participate in the study, each participant will be given a study&#xD;
      information leaflet and introduced to the research coordination for further explanation of&#xD;
      the study and to sign the study consent form. Once consent form is signed, the participant&#xD;
      will be given a study self-sampling kit and instructions on how to perform the self-sampling&#xD;
      (see Appendix A). The participant performed the self-sampling test in the clinic in a private&#xD;
      area and hand over the completed kit to the research coordinator who will label and keep the&#xD;
      sample for process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post assessment: On completion, the participant will be invited to complete a 10 to 15&#xD;
      minutes questionnaire to assess women's acceptability on self-sampling method. Upon&#xD;
      completion of the questionnaire, the participant will be awarded a study token of&#xD;
      appreciation prior to leaving the clinic. The participant clinical management will not be&#xD;
      affected by the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected for this study will be in a password protected Microsoft Excel software. Only&#xD;
      the primary investigator and co-investigators will have access to the database for the&#xD;
      purpose of data analysis. Sample size was calculated based on the number of women between the&#xD;
      ages of 30 and 69 in Singapore's population (as of June 2017). Using a 95% confidence level,&#xD;
      it was determined that a sample size of 120 - 150 women would be ideal. The sample size was&#xD;
      calculated using G*Power. SPSS will be used to analyze the data collected. Descriptive&#xD;
      analyses will be done on the survey data to get demographic data, and to determine&#xD;
      participants' perceptions and ratings of the self-sampling methods. Multivariate analyses&#xD;
      will be used to determine the sensitivity of the self-sampling method with physician-taken&#xD;
      swab as the reference standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient details: Name and NRIC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient demographics: Age, Race, area code, parity, social economic status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reason for HPV DNA test: Primary screening or secondary screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening results:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Physician sampling HPV DNA test&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Self-sampling HPV DNA test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completed questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our specific aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the sensitivity of self-sampling method compared to physician sampling&#xD;
           method for HPV DNA test in cervical cancer screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine acceptability of self-sampling HPV DNA test using flocked swab in cervical&#xD;
           cancer screening&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to give a more accurate local view of the sensitivity of floq swab and&#xD;
      acceptability for self-sampling to Singaporean women. Published studies on self-sampling are&#xD;
      mainly from the western countries and perception may not be similar for local women.&#xD;
      Currently available self-sampling in the market are expensive and thus will not be cost&#xD;
      effective if to be introduced to the current Singapore cervical cancer screening program. As&#xD;
      Singapore is also moving towards HPV primary screening in the very near future, this study&#xD;
      will aid in providing the next step to the screening program by introducing a method that can&#xD;
      help to increase uptake of screening in particular in the underscreen population in&#xD;
      Singapore.&#xD;
