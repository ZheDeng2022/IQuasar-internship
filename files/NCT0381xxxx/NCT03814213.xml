  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older cancer patients referred to Oncology outpatient Clinic at Aarhus University Hospital&#xD;
      have for a period been offered Comprehensive geriatric Assessment (CGA) as part of a routine&#xD;
      practice. Oncology Department was responsible for planning the CGA. A number of patients did&#xD;
      however not recieve this offer as planning failed. This Group of patients will be compared to&#xD;
      patients recieving Geriatric assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients recieving CGA is part of a Randomised controlled study (ID: NCT02837679) comparing&#xD;
      CGA without 90 days follow-up to CGA with 90 days of Comprehensive geriatric care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are identified from electronic medical files. Data regarding death is obtained from&#xD;
      Medical files.&#xD;

      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  70 years or more&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cancer of the head and neck (HNC), lung (LC), upper gastro-intestinal- tract (UGI) or&#xD;
           colo-rectal cancer (CRC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Referred to the Outpatient Clinic at department of oncology at Aarhus University&#xD;
           Hospital for cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Living in Aarhus, Favrskov, Odder or Skanderborg Municipalities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Referred for specialised palliative care&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with both newly diagnosed cancer disease and patients with a relapse of previously&#xD;
      treated cancer disease are included. Patients qualify for participation regardless of the&#xD;
      stage of the cancer disease and regardless if specific cancer treatment is initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The oncology department is responsible for identifying patients and informing of the planned&#xD;
      CGA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All potential patients referred to the oncology outpatient clinic are identified by&#xD;
      retrospective review of lists of planned consultations in the oncology department out patient&#xD;
      clinic available in the electronic medical file approximately once a week. By this procedure&#xD;
      patients who were not informed of the possibility of having a CGA are identified (Group1)&#xD;
      Patients who are referred for geriatric evaluation have a complete CGA at baseline. The CGA&#xD;
      comprises 7 instruments for assessing health: Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and&#xD;
      Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) for autonomy, Mini Nutritional Status (MNA)&#xD;
      for nutritional state, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) for Cognitive state, Geriatric&#xD;
      Depression Scale 15-item (GDS) for mood and Cumulative Illness Rating Scale - Geriatrics&#xD;
      (CIRS-G) for comorbidity and number of daily medication for polypharmacy as previously&#xD;
      published. According to CGA, patients were given a CGA-status of &quot;fit&quot;, &quot;vulnerable&quot; or&#xD;
      &quot;frail&quot;. In order to be &quot;fit&quot; all of the following should be present: Independence in ADL and&#xD;
      IADL, less than 5 daily medications, no severe comorbidity and no more than 2 well controlled&#xD;
      comorbidities, normal cognitive ability and no indications of depression or malnutrition.&#xD;
      Information on whether or not the multidisciplinary team initiated any individual&#xD;
      action/advice based on the CGA in group 1 and group 2 was registered as well. Interventions&#xD;
      initiated by the multidisciplinary team were recorded in four categories: medical changes,&#xD;
      nutritional intervention, physical intervention or social intervention. These interventions&#xD;
      were registered before randomization was performed Frail and vulnerable patients are offered&#xD;
      participation in a controlled randomized study (Clinical trialsID: NCT02837679). Patients are&#xD;
      randomly and 1:1 assigned to either: No tailored follow-up (Group 2) or 90 days tailored&#xD;
      follow up (group 3). Randomization were performed by REDcap and allocated equally by&#xD;
      CGA-status (frail/vulnerable), gender and index tumor site (CRC or no-CRC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not possible to blind patients or the multidisciplinary team of the randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 has no tailored follow up on the problems found during CGA. Group 3 has 90 days&#xD;
      tailored follow-up on problems that were identified during CGA and problems that evolved&#xD;
      during the follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tailored follow-up The tailored intervention consists of phone calls, home visits, or contact&#xD;
      to community care-takers. A multidisciplinary team consisting of a trained geriatric nurse&#xD;
      and a geriatrician specialist performs the follow up. The team can perform clinical&#xD;
      investigation of patients, initiate changes in medication, or referral to further&#xD;
      investigation. Furthermore transfusion of blood, fluids or i.v. antibiotics could be&#xD;
      performed either at home or in the geriatric out patient clinic.&#xD;
