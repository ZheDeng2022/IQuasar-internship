  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a FIH (first-in-human) adaptive PET (Positron Emission Tomography) imaging study to&#xD;
      explore the binding and kinetic properties of two potential mutant huntingtin (mHTT)&#xD;
      radioligands; [¹¹C]CHDI-00485180-R and [¹¹C]CHDI-00485626.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The binding characteristics of these radioligands will be evaluated first in young (&lt; 35&#xD;
      years of age) healthy control (HC) participants (Phase 1a) and subsequently in young HCs and&#xD;
      Huntington's disease gene-expansion carriers (HDGECs) with Stage II HD (Phase 1b). Subsequent&#xD;
      phases will continue to explore the radioligands' binding characteristics in HDGECs with&#xD;
      Stage II HD (Phase 2a), Stage I HD (Phase 2b) and pre-manifest HDGECs (Phase 2c) and their&#xD;
      age matched healthy controls. All phases are cross-sectional and will include comparisons&#xD;
      between HCs and HDGECs. Test-retest (TRT) evaluations will be done during Phase 2a, with the&#xD;
      option of including further test-retests in Phases 2b, and 2c after review of data by the&#xD;
      iMagemHTT Executive Committee. TRT is only applicable to HDGEC participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are four planned interim analyses at which either radioligand may be dropped if its&#xD;
      characteristics are shown to be suboptimal. If successful, the study will establish&#xD;
      [¹¹C]CHDI-00485180-R and/or [¹¹C]CHDI-00485626 as fit for further development as drug&#xD;
      development tools to measure mHTT levels in HDGECs. This development is intended to&#xD;
      demonstrate the value of PET imaging with these radioligands as a disease progression&#xD;
      biomarker, predictive biomarker, pharmacodynamic biomarker, and eventually as an efficacy&#xD;
      biomarker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All HDGEC participants will be invited to provide an optional cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)&#xD;
      sample that will be collected after the imaging visits are complete. These samples will be&#xD;
      processed to evaluate CSF mHTT levels and other potential biomarkers and to explore potential&#xD;
      relationships between soluble CSF mHTT levels and mHTT binding identified by&#xD;
      [¹¹C]CHDI-00485180-R and/or [¹¹C]CHDI-00485626 PET imaging. Potential CSF biomarkers that&#xD;
      might be co-expressed or accumulated in HD may also be examined.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study investigators have developed two novel PET radioligands that will be evaluated for&#xD;
      their suitability for use in clinical research settings to quantify mHTT in HDGECs. The PET&#xD;
      radioligands do not have any pharmacological effect at the microdoses (total dose &lt;100ug) at&#xD;
      which they will be administered; they will not be administered at pharmacological doses. This&#xD;
      study has a modular design in two phases, and each phase will enroll a small independent&#xD;
      cohort. The execution of each subsequent phase is dependent on results from the previous&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 is the initial evaluation of the PET radioligands. A suitable PET radioligand is&#xD;
      expected to produce quantifiably higher binding in HD participants' brains compared to young&#xD;
      HC participants' brains (since they do not express mHTT). Phase 1 is divided in two sub&#xD;
      phases: Phase 1a will evaluate the basic safety and kinetic properties as well as brain&#xD;
      uptake in three (3) young HCs; Phase 1b will test the difference in binding in six (6) HDGECs&#xD;
      with Stage II HD compared to six (6) young HCs (three (3) young HCs will be imaged in&#xD;
      addition to the three (3) young HCs from 1a. The rationale behind using young HCs in Phase 1&#xD;
      is to screen out HC participants who may have undiagnosed amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, a potential&#xD;
      off-target binding site for [¹¹C]CHDI-00485180-R. The rationale behind imaging HDGECs with&#xD;
      Stage II HD in Phase 1 is based on the hypothesis that the density of mHTT aggregates&#xD;
      increases with disease severity, and the ability to detect a difference in binding between&#xD;
      HCs and HDGECs is expected to be higher in Stage II HD (more severe stages of HD will not be&#xD;
      included in this study). An option to image three (3) pre-manifest HDGECs from Phase 2c (see&#xD;
      below) will be included in case the results indicate that brain atrophy (i.e., loss of&#xD;
      aggregate due to atrophy) affects the binding and evaluation of the PET radioligands in&#xD;
      HDGECs with Stage II HD. For each of the two PET radioligands a Go/ No-Go evaluation will&#xD;
      take place (for overview see Figure 1); if satisfactory results are not obtained for a&#xD;
      particular radioligand, then that radioligand will not progress to evaluation in further&#xD;
      phases. Promising results for either radioligand will lead to that particular radioligand&#xD;
      continuing to Phase 2 evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 will evaluate the sensitivity of the PET radioligand(s) to discriminate between&#xD;
      different stages and severity of HD. In addition, a TRT in Phase 2 will evaluate the&#xD;
      variability of repeated imaging for the PET radioligand. Phase 2 has a sequential design in&#xD;
      sub phases that will assess the sensitivity of the radioligand in descending severity of HD:&#xD;
      2a in six (6) HDGECs with Stage II HD and six (6) age-matched controls; 2b in six (6) HDGECs&#xD;
      with Stage I HD and six (6) age-matched controls; 2c in six (6) premanifest HDGECs and six&#xD;
      (6) age-matched controls. The rationale for imaging groups of descending HD severity is based&#xD;
      on the hypothesis that the density of mHTT aggregates increases with disease severity, and&#xD;
      the ability to detect a difference in binding between HCs and HDGECs is expected to be lowest&#xD;
      in the premanifest stage. This design will enable a stepwise assessment of the sensitivity of&#xD;
      the PET radioligands. After each sub-phase a Go/No-Go evaluation will take place; if&#xD;
      satisfactory results are not obtained for a particular radioligand then that radioligand will&#xD;
      not be evaluated in further sub-phases. Promising results for either radioligand will lead to&#xD;
      that particular radioligand continuing to the next sub-phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study design allows each radioligand to be reviewed and analyzed after evaluation in&#xD;
      each cohort. The progression through each level of analysis will indicate whether either or&#xD;
      both radioligands will measure mHTT aggregate levels with sufficient sensitivity to become&#xD;
      potential disease progression and efficacy biomarker(s) in HDGECs.&#xD;
