  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      FreeStyle Libre (FSL) is a novel glucose monitoring device (Flash glucose monitoring) in the&#xD;
      form of a disc worn on the arm for 14 days, and a hand-held reader which is designed to&#xD;
      largely replace the recommended 4-10 painful finger-stick blood glucose tests required each&#xD;
      day for the self-management of type 1 diabetes. The purpose of this study is to determine&#xD;
      whether flash glucose monitoring with FSL device will improve HbA1c over 24 weeks compared to&#xD;
      self-monitoring of blood glucose in adults and adolescents (16 or older) with sub-optimally&#xD;
      controlled (HbA1c 7.5% to 11%) type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label, multi-centre, randomised, parallel design study, involving a 2-week&#xD;
      run-in period, followed by a 24-week study period during which participants will use either&#xD;
      FSL or continue usual finger-stick glucose monitoring in random order. A total of up to 160&#xD;
      participants (aiming for 128 completed participants) aged 16 years and older with T1D on&#xD;
      insulin pump therapy or multiple daily injection therapy will be recruited through diabetes&#xD;
      clinics in participating centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive appropriate training to maximise the benefits of FSL and&#xD;
      finger-stick glucose levels in self-management. The primary outcome is the difference in&#xD;
      HbA1c between the two groups at 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes are time spent with glucose&#xD;
      levels above and below target, as recorded by FSL, and other flash glucose-based metrics.&#xD;
      Impact on quality of life, diabetes distress, mood, needle burden, disordered eating and&#xD;
      treatment satisfaction will also be undertaken. Relative cost-effectiveness of FSL device&#xD;
      compared with self-monitoring will also be assessed from a UK NHS perspective.&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An open-label, multi-centre, randomised, parallel study, in adults and adolescents (16 years&#xD;
      and older) with type 1 diabetes and sub-optimal glycaemic control (HbA1c 7.5% to 11%), either&#xD;
      on insulin pump treatment or multiple daily injections, contrasting flash glucose monitoring&#xD;
      using FreeStyle Libre device with traditional finger-stick glucose monitoring for 24 weeks.&#xD;
      Expecting approximately 15% to 20% dropout rate recruitment will aim for 160 participants&#xD;
      aiming for 150 randomised and 128 completed participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a UK multi-centre and recruitment will take place at the following centres:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Diabetes Centres within Manchester University Foundation Trust&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Royal Derby Hospital, Derby&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, Norwich&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Queen Alexandra Hospital, Portsmouth&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each centre will aim to recruit between 25 to 30 participants. Additional diabetes centres&#xD;
      surrounding above hospitals may act as participant identification centres. Potential&#xD;
      participants will be identified by their treating clinicians and invited to contact the&#xD;
      research team. They will be sent the study information leaflets and an invitation by post or&#xD;
      in-person to join the study by the research team at least one day before the recruitment&#xD;
      visit. The study may also be advertised via social media.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After recruitment, consent, subjects will be randomised for 24-weeks home use of&#xD;
      flash-glucose monitoring or 24-weeks use finger-stick glucose monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes up to 7 visits for participants completing the study. Maximum time in&#xD;
      study is 30 weeks. Each study visit can be scheduled with +/- 2 weeks of the planned visit&#xD;
      date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Recruitment Visit and Screening Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the participants have agreed to participate in the study, they will be invited for the&#xD;
      recruitment visit, and given a participant ID, when the following activities will be&#xD;
      performed by the research team:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  written informed consent/assent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  checking inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  medical and diabetes history including the presence of diabetes complications and&#xD;
           hypoglycaemia burden&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ethnicity, body weight and height measurement; calculation of BMI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  record of current insulin therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  urine or blood pregnancy test (females of child-bearing potential)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  record of occupation and educational attainment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  any history of disordered eating or needle phobia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  previous participation in structured education, the status of carb counting, use of&#xD;
           bolus calculator&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Blood Sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be taken to measure HbA1c (measured at the local laboratory if not done&#xD;
      within the last two weeks). Renal and Thyroid function will also be evaluated (if not done in&#xD;
      last one year). Less than 15 ml of whole blood will be taken from each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of participants' responses in terms of quality of life, diabetes distress, needle&#xD;
      burden, disordered eating, depression and diabetes treatment satisfaction using&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. EQ-5DL-5L questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Type 1 Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS),&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Diabetes fear of injecting and self-testing (D-FISQ) questionnaire,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Diabetes Eating Problem Survey (DEPS-R),&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ),&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The Glucose Monitoring Satisfaction Survey (GMSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Hypoglycaemia burden will be assessed using Clarke questionnaire and Gold score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: Insertion of the blinded glucose monitoring device&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of visit 2 is to insert a blinded glucose monitor (FreeStyle Libre Pro device). The&#xD;
      participant will be provided with instructions about using this device for the next two&#xD;
      weeks. Visit two may be combined with visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3: Adherence assessment, randomisation and the start of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Visit 3, participant's adherence/tolerance of using the flash-CGM over preceding 14&#xD;
      days will be assessed. To proceed with the study participant should have worn the blinded&#xD;
      glucose monitoring device for at least ten days' during the last 14 days of the run-in&#xD;
      period. If the participant fails to demonstrate adherence or develops any significant allergy&#xD;
      or intolerance to the glucose sensor, the study will be terminated, and the participant will&#xD;
      be removed from the study. Participant randomisation for the treatment intervention will take&#xD;
      place during visit 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initiation of study treatment The participant will arrive at the clinical facility or clinic&#xD;
      at the agreed time. Body weight measurement will be made. Participants will be provided with&#xD;
      necessary training on the use of study devices according to randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training session Participants randomised to flash-glucose monitoring arm will receive&#xD;
      education and training about insertion and initiation of the sensor as well as how to use&#xD;
      flash-glucose monitoring data for treatment optimisation. They will be encouraged to download&#xD;
      data at home to identify pattern recognition. This session will be conducted by a&#xD;
      professional diabetes educator or a member of the study team. Education will be tailored to&#xD;
      meet the needs of the individual. Participants randomised to conventional finger-stick&#xD;
      glucose monitoring arm will be encouraged to use finger-stick glucose levels to optimise&#xD;
      treatment and will receive education about insulin dose adjustments using finger-stick&#xD;
      glucose levels. The study will try to mimic real-life conditions by continuing participants&#xD;
      pre-study diabetes treatment unchanged and finger-stick glucose testing frequency as&#xD;
      determined by the participant as required. Participants in both arms will also receive&#xD;
      training on sick day rules and dealing with hypo and hyperglycaemia. Participants will be&#xD;
      provided with a paper diary to collect information about insulin doses and carbohydrate&#xD;
      intake in the last three days of each study month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4: (+4 weeks since randomisation): Review data and treatment optimisation Purpose of&#xD;
      this visit is to review data from Flash-glucose monitoring and finger-stick glucose&#xD;
      monitoring to further optimise treatment. Study devices will be downloaded. Information about&#xD;
      insulin doses and any adverse events will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 5: (+12 weeks since randomisation): Review data and treatment optimisation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of this visit is to review data from Flash-glucose monitoring and finger-stick&#xD;
      glucose monitoring to further optimise treatment. Study devices will be downloaded.&#xD;
      Information about insulin doses, participant diaries and any adverse events will be&#xD;
      collected. A blood sample will be collected for HbA1c.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 6: (+22 weeks since randomisation): Finger-stick glucose monitoring arm only&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomised to finger-stick glucose monitoring arm will have an extra visit ten&#xD;
      weeks after visit 5 to insert a blinded glucose sensor for data capture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 7: (+24 weeks since randomisation): End of randomised study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be invited to attend the research centre approximately 12 weeks after&#xD;
      Visit 5. This would be the end of 24 weeks randomised study period. All study devices will be&#xD;
      downloaded. Insulin usage data will be recorded and diaries collected. The participant will&#xD;
      have a blood test for the HbA1c. Body weight measurement will be made. The participant will&#xD;
      be asked to complete the same questionnaires completed at Visit1. In addition, participants&#xD;
      in the FSL arm will be asked to complete a additional questionnaire exploring expectations&#xD;
      and experience of using FSL during the study. A subset of participants (n=40 aiming for 25&#xD;
      completed questionnaires) in the FSL arm and subset of researchers (n=10) will also be asked&#xD;
      to complete additional questionnaires to help with the process evaluation.&#xD;
