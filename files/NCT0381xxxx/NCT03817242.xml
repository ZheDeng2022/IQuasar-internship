    <textblock>
      The rationale of this study is to find out the surgical outcome and success rates of tragal&#xD;
      cartilage and temporalis fascia, subsequently to develop guide line in light of the results&#xD;
      of this study for our department as our institute is going to follow one patient in one bed&#xD;
      policy in future. The purpose of this study is to compare the graft success rate of cartilage&#xD;
      versus temporalis fascia in tympanoplasty type I in our institute, as no such study has been&#xD;
      conducted in our province before.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tympanic membrane is forming lateral wall of the middle ear cleft which separates middle ear&#xD;
      from the external auditory canal. It is made of three layers except in the upper part (Pars&#xD;
      Flaccida). The outer layer of TM (Tympanic Membrane) is made of epithelium; middle layer is&#xD;
      fibrous tissue, while inner layer is mucosal lining. The thickness of TM measures 0.1 mm,&#xD;
      having diameter of 7-10 mm, weighing approximately 14 mg. The function of TM is to assist in&#xD;
      hearing and protection of middle ear from infection. Perforation in tympanic membrane is the&#xD;
      loss in continuity of TM layers. The causes of TM perforation may be trauma like blast,&#xD;
      accident and firearm or infection of the middle ear like acute or chronic suppurative otitis&#xD;
      media. It can also be iatrogenic as in case of placement of grommet for glue ear. The purpose&#xD;
      of Tympanoplasty is to reconstruct TM perforation and restores sound conducting mechanism. In&#xD;
      1955, Zoellner and Wullstein used different types of graft materials for tympanoplasty. Later&#xD;
      Heermann introduced cartilage palisade graft labeled as Simmering Technique. Similarly&#xD;
      Goodhill also introduced first cartilage perichondrium composite graft material. Different&#xD;
      graft materials can be used to close the TM defect. Some of these materials are temporalis&#xD;
      fascia, tragal cartilage, perichondrium and fat. Temporalis fascia and tragal perichondrium&#xD;
      had more anatomic proximity, compliance and translucency. The mode of action of these&#xD;
      biological graft materials is that it provides support for the membrane remnant to&#xD;
      proliferate and heal the defect. The temporalis fascia is thin, translucent and available in&#xD;
      sufficient amount; but due to its close resemblance with tympanomeatal flap in color it may&#xD;
      be displaced unintentionally during handling. However the reported success rate of temporalis&#xD;
      fascia graft in literature varies from 93 to 97%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand cartilage is middle ear friendly and survives for comparatively longer time&#xD;
      due to the fact that its nourishment is based on diffusion process. Due to rigid nature of&#xD;
      cartilage it prevents medialization of the graft to promontory in case of severe eustachian&#xD;
      tube dysfunction. Cartilage graft is used in cases of chronically malfunction eustachian&#xD;
      tube, adhesive otitis media, recurrent perforation and large TM perforation. But its demerits&#xD;
      are its thick nature which hinders sound conduction and it is limited availability. The&#xD;
      success rate of the cartilage graft tympanoplasty varies in the literature from 43 - 100%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic suppurative otitis media is an endemic health problem in our society. The reasons&#xD;
      could be probably low literacy level, communities situated far flung from health facilities,&#xD;
      lack of specialist service to the public in outreach area and inappropriate treatment of the&#xD;
      middle ear infections. Sufficient number of patient suffering from inactive mucosal chronic&#xD;
      otitis media with decreased hearing are presenting to otolaryngology unit. Tympanoplasty is&#xD;
      the surgery of choice for chronic otitis media inactive mucosal type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis is that cartilage graft tympanoplasty is more successful than temporalis fascia&#xD;
      tympanoplasty.&#xD;
