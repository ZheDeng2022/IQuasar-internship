  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most children diagnosed with craniosynostosis undergo a relatively extensive cranial vault&#xD;
      remodeling procedure. The decision of performing surgical cranial shape correction for&#xD;
      patients with craniosynostosis typically rests on a subjective visual assessment of the&#xD;
      severity of the cranial malformation and the main goal of this procedure is to reduce the&#xD;
      risk of elevated intracranial pressure and to provide a more normal cranial shape and volume.&#xD;
      Personalized surgical planning systems to optimize intervention and leverage surgical&#xD;
      expertise in the reconstruction of the cranial vault do not exist. Thus, the expertise of the&#xD;
      surgeon is paramount for the success of the surgical correction of craniosynostosis. The goal&#xD;
      of our project is to evaluate the feasibility and utility of a surgical plan derived from&#xD;
      software developed at Children's National, iCSPlan.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Presurgical planning will be performed in patients that require an open crania-vault&#xD;
      reconstruction for craniosynostosis. The participants will come from the outpatient clinics&#xD;
      of neurosurgery and plastic surgery. The treating physician/study team member will explain&#xD;
      and give a copy of Institutional review board (IRB) approved study information letter to the&#xD;
      participant's legally authorized representative (LAR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will acquire a pre-operative CT-scan, per standard of care, to help assess&#xD;
      the synostosis severity, within 4 weeks before the procedure. A week before the surgery, a&#xD;
      routine preoperative visit will be done where the participant and/or LAR, if agree to&#xD;
      participate in the study, will sign the informed consent document(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A presurgical plan will be built and will be recorded in a software, iCSPlan. Although this&#xD;
      plan will not be integrated in the OR workflow, if needed, it would be visualized on a&#xD;
      desktop monitor, which will be available to the surgical team. This tool will not influence&#xD;
      any clinical decision making in the study. Instead, it will work as a rely-on tool in the&#xD;
      preparation of the surgery, which may or may not be followed by the surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic information (sex, age), as well as intraoperative information (Anesthesia length,&#xD;
      anesthesia medications, length of surgery, blood loss, # of blood units transfused,&#xD;
      complications), will be recorded for analysis. These variables are generally recorded during&#xD;
      surgery and add no additional operative time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the surgery, the specialists will evaluate the feasibility of the use of the&#xD;
      presurgical plan by completing a questionnaire to report their options on (1): Quality of the&#xD;
      surgical outcome; (2) the quality of the surgical strategy, and (3) the utility of the&#xD;
      surgical planning in the treatment. The questions will be answered on a 5-point Likert scale,&#xD;
      ranging from &quot;not useful/strongly dislike&quot; to &quot;very useful/strongly like&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study team pre-screening materials that contain participants information will be&#xD;
      maintained on password protected computers. Only authorized study team members will have&#xD;
      access to the pre-screening materials. Any pre-screening protected health information (PHI)&#xD;
      that is collected will be destroyed once study enrollment is completed.&#xD;

    <description>The Investigator will acquire a routine pre-operative CT-scan to help assess the synostosis severity. A week before the surgery a routine preoperative visit will be done. If the potential subject agrees to participate in the study, a presurgical plan will be built, and based on the CT scan, it will (1) quantify shape differences between pathological and healthy cranial shapes; (2) compensates for brain and cranial growth during the months between diagnosis, treatment and recovery; and (3) guides bone-cuts and bone-placement for the simplest and optimal surgical procedure.&#xD;
Finally this plan will be recorded in a software, iCSPlan, which will be reviewed by the surgeon. If it is accepted, it will be available during the surgery as a rely-on tool which may or may not be followed.</description>
