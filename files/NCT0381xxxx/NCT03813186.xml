  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to examine blood levels of ASTX727, a fixed-dose combination tablet&#xD;
      containing the combination of cedazuridine (100 mg) and decitabine (35 mg), when given under&#xD;
      fed versus fasted conditions to participants with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), including&#xD;
      refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia&#xD;
      (CMML), or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This study will also assess the safety of ASTX727.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, multicenter, open-label, randomized, two-sequence, crossover study of&#xD;
      ASTX727 in participants with MDS, including refractory anemia with excess blasts in&#xD;
      transformation or CMML, and AML. Participants will continue to be enrolled until evaluable&#xD;
      data is collected from 12 participants. It is expected that approximately 18 participants&#xD;
      will be enrolled in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in 28-day cycles. All participants will take part in Cycle 1 and&#xD;
      may continue into Cycles ≥2 at the investigator's discretion. Participants will receive one&#xD;
      tablet of ASTX727 containing 100 mg cedazuridine and 35 mg decitabine once daily for 5 days&#xD;
      in 28-day cycles starting from Cycle 1 Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive high-calorie, high-fat breakfast&#xD;
      meal pre-dose on either Day 2 or Day 4 of Cycle 1. Blood will be drawn at specified time&#xD;
      points in Cycle 1 on Days 2 through 5 to assess the effect of food on the PK of cedazuridine&#xD;
      and decitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the first treatment cycle, participants may continue to receive treatment&#xD;
      with ASTX727 at the investigator's discretion for subsequent cycles (Days 1 through 5 of&#xD;
      28-day cycles), until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, investigator decision to&#xD;
      discontinue treatment, or the participant decides to discontinue treatment or withdraw from&#xD;
      the study. In Cycles ≥2, participants will fast for 2 hours before and 2 hours after taking&#xD;
      the ASTX727 tablet on all dosing days.&#xD;
