      Aim. To compare changes in cardiac autonomic tone caused by radio-frequency versus&#xD;
      cryoballoon ablation and to assess their value in predicting the outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study group. In this prospective randomized study 126 consecutive patients with paroxysmal AF&#xD;
      undergoing first ablation of AF using radio-frequency (RF) or cryoballoon (CB) technique will&#xD;
      be recruited. Patients will undergo several ECG and autonomic tests before and after the&#xD;
      procedure. The follow-up will last one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Standard 12-lead ECG a day before and 1-2 days after the procedure will be performed.&#xD;

           before and after ablation will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A 24-hour Holter ECG will be performed at baseline (1-2 days before ablation) and 7-day&#xD;
           Holter ECG will be performed 3, 6 and 12 months after the procedure. Minimal, maximal&#xD;
           and mean heart rate (HR) as well as HRV parameters will be analyzed. The differences (∆)&#xD;
           in these variables between baseline and post-ablation Holter ECG recordings will be&#xD;

           hemodynamic parameters (stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), total peripheral&#xD;
           resistance (TPR)) will be also examined before and after orthostatic stress. This will&#xD;
           be performed using tilt table test and non-invasive measurement of autonomic and&#xD;
           hemodynamic parameters before and shortly after (1-3 days) the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;

      ABLation-induced changes in cardiac Autonomic Nervous System in patients with Atrial&#xD;
      Fibrillation: radiofrequency versus cryoballoon techniques (the ABLANSAF study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction. The primary goal of ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF) is pulmonary vein&#xD;
      isolation (PVI). The second mechanism of action of ablation is modification of cardiac&#xD;
      autonomic tone by ablation of atrial ganglionated plexi, mainly of their parasympathetic&#xD;
      component. Data in literature concerning this topic is scares. A few studies showed that&#xD;
      ablation-induced changes in heart rate variability (HRV) or sinus rate (SR) predict the&#xD;
      outcome. However, these data are preliminary and have not yet been included into clinical&#xD;
      practice. Moreover, whether these effects depend on the technique used - radio-frequency (RF)&#xD;
      ablation or cryoballoon (CB) ablation, has not yet been examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim. To compare the changes in cardiac autonomic tone caused by RF versus CB ablation and to&#xD;
      assess their value in predicting the outcome after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis. We hypothesised that both techniques cause significant changes in cardiac&#xD;
      autonomic innervation, however, these changes are significantly more pronounced following CB&#xD;
      rather than RF ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. Study group. In this prospective randomised study 126 consecutive patients with&#xD;
      paroxysmal AF undergoing first ablation of AF using RF or CB technique will be recruited.&#xD;
      Patients will undergo several ECG and autonomic tests before and after the procedure. The&#xD;
      follow-up will last one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ablation The RF and CB ablation will be performed using standard approach. A patient will be&#xD;
      randomly selected to RF or CB ablation. The only parameter influencing randomisation will be&#xD;
      the presence of the common trunk of the left PV (visualised by computed tomography or&#xD;
      rotational angiography) which is regarded as relative contraindication to CB because of&#xD;
      anatomical difficulties in the positioning of balloon. In such cases the decision as to the&#xD;
      type of procedure will be left to the discretion of the operator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CB PVI will be conducted in standard manner. Briefly, after injection of local&#xD;
      anesthetic, both femoral veins is punctured. One long sheath (8.5 F Swartz, St. Jude, Saint&#xD;
      Paul, USA) to cross interatrial septum is inserted in the right femoral vein. Another two&#xD;
      short sheaths were inserted in the left femoral vein for the intracardiac echocardiographic&#xD;
      probe (8 or 10 Fr Acunav, Acuson, Siemens, Berlin) and diagnostic catheter introduced into&#xD;
      the coronary sinus. After crossing the septum and introducing guidewire into the left&#xD;
      superior pulmonary vein (LSPV), long sheath is replaced with steerable sheath (14 F.,&#xD;
      Flexcath, Medtronic, Minneapolis, USA) and CB (28 mm, second generation) is introduced into&#xD;
      the left atrium. Next, the Achieve (20 mm diameter) mapping catheter, (Medtronic, Milwaukee,&#xD;
      USA) is placed in the LSPV ostium, CB inflated and contrast injected to confirm proper&#xD;
      occlusion of LSPV. When PVI is achieved during first freezing lasting 180 - 240 sec and&#xD;
      confirmed by PV potentials (PVP) disappearance within 60 seconds by recordings from the&#xD;
      Achieve catheter, no second cryoapplication is performed. In case of incomplete occlusion,&#xD;
      persistence or very late disappearance of PVP, suboptimal temperatures achieved (less than&#xD;
      -36C) or very short thawing time, CB is repositioned and another cryo-application is&#xD;
      delivered. Next, CB-PVI of the left inferior pulmonary vein (LIPV), right superior pulmonary&#xD;
      vein (RSPV) and right inferior pulmonary vein (RIPV) is performed. Pacing of the right&#xD;
      phrenic nerve is performed during CB of the right veins to avoid phrenic nerve palsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RF ablation is performed in a standard manner using 3-D electro-anatomical system CARTO-3&#xD;
      (Biosense Webster, USA) and Smarttouch ablation catheter. Two separate transseptal punctures&#xD;
      are performed under intracardiac echocardiography guidance. After reconstruction of the left&#xD;
      atrial geometry using merging of the computed tomography or rotational angiography image with&#xD;
      the CARTO map, the point-by-point PVI of each vein is performed. The ablation index is used&#xD;
      to ensure the quality of RF applications. The Lasso circular catheter (Biosense Webster, USA)&#xD;
      is used to assess PVI and diagnostic catheter placed in the coronary sinus is used for pacing&#xD;
      manoeuvres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Standard 12-lead ECG a day before and 1-2 days after the procedure will be performed.&#xD;
           The SR and P wave duration as well as the difference (∆) in SR and P wave duration&#xD;
           before and after ablation will be analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A 24-hour Holter ECG will be performed at baseline (1-2 days before ablation) and 7-day&#xD;
           Holter ECG will be performed 3, 6 and 12 months after the procedure. Minimal, maximal&#xD;
           and mean heart rate (HR) as well as time-domain HRV parameters (SDNN, SDANN, pNN50,&#xD;
           rMSSD) and frequency-domain HRV indices (LF, HF, LF/HF) will be analysed. The&#xD;
           differences (∆) in these variables between baseline and post-ablation Holter ECG&#xD;
           recordings will be analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Autonomic parameters (HR, frequency-domain HRV parameters and baro-reflex sensitivity&#xD;
           (BRS) using sequential method) as well as hemodynamic parameters (stroke volume (SV),&#xD;
           cardiac output (CO), total peripheral resistance (TPR)) will be also examined before and&#xD;
           after orthostatic stress. This will be performed using tilt table test (70 degrees) and&#xD;
           non-invasive measurement of autonomic and hemodynamic parameters (cardiac impedance&#xD;
           method) using the Task Force system, before (1-2 days) and shortly after (1-3 days) the&#xD;
           procedure. The 5-min ECG recordings will be used to calculate the values of autonomic&#xD;
           and haemodynamic parameters. Also ∆ of these parameters will be computed. The values&#xD;
           measured before and after ablation, before and after tilt testing as well ∆ will be&#xD;
           compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Quality of life will be assessed using the AFSS scale and EHRA scale at baseline and 3,&#xD;
           6 and 12 months after ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Follow-up will last 12 months. Efficacy of ablation will be assessed during outpatients&#xD;
           visits and using 7-day Holter ECG recordings 3, 6 and 12 months after the procedure. The&#xD;
           analysed outcomes will include symptomatic recurrences of AF, hospitalisations due to&#xD;
           AF, redo procedures i occurrence of asymptomatic AF on Holter ECG monitoring. Efficacy&#xD;
           of the procedure will be assessed and defined as (1) complete efficacy - no symptoms&#xD;
           attributed to AF and no AF on Holter ECG monitoring; (2) symptomatic efficacy - no&#xD;
           symptoms attributed to AF but AF episodes &gt; 30 sec recorded on Holter ECG monitoring;&#xD;
           (3) partial efficacy - recurrences of symptomatic AF, however, of lower intensity,&#xD;
           defined as improvement of at least 1 degree in the EHRA scale and improvement in the&#xD;
           AFSS scale; and (4) no effects - no change in symptoms compared with the pre-ablation&#xD;
           periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. All the above listed parameters and ablation efficacy will be compared between the RF&#xD;
           and CB groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis. The results will be presented as mean±SD (normally distributed&#xD;
      variables) or median values (not normally distributed variables). The changes between&#xD;
      baseline and parameters obtained after ablation as well as before and after tilt testing will&#xD;
      be performed using paired two-tailed Student t-test, Mann-Whitney or ANOVA tests where&#xD;
      appropriate. The results obtained in the RF versus CB groups will be compared using unpaired&#xD;
      Student t-test. The predictive value of examined parameters in identifying responders to&#xD;
      ablation will be assessed using the ROC curves and by computing sensitivity, specificity,&#xD;
      positive and negative predictive value. Multivariate analysis will be performed to identify&#xD;
      parameters independently associated with ablation efficacy. A p value &lt; 0.05 will be&#xD;
      considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimated number of patients sufficient to detect significant difference between the RF&#xD;
      and CB groups is 126 based on the assumption that ablation-induced changes in cardiac&#xD;
      autonomic parameters will differ between the RF and CB groups by 20% (alfa error = 0.05 and&#xD;
      beta error = 0.2) Anticipated results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ablation significantly effects the parameters of cardiac autonomic control&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. These effects are more pronounced in the CB group compared with the RF group&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Changes in autonomic indices have value in predicting ablation efficacy in both analysed&#xD;
           groups.&#xD;
