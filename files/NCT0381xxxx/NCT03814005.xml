  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pevonedistat is a medicine to treat people with blood cancers or solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of the study is to learn about the levels of pevonedistat in the blood of&#xD;
      participants with blood cancers or solid tumors, who also have severe kidney problems or mild&#xD;
      to moderate liver problems. The information from this study will be used to work out the best&#xD;
      dose of pevonedistat to give people with these conditions in future studies. At the first&#xD;
      visit, the study doctor will check who can take part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is in 2 parts: A and B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A Participants will be placed into 1 of 4 treatment groups depending on how severe their&#xD;
      kidney and liver problems are. All participants will receive 1 dose of pevonedistat as a slow&#xD;
      injection in their vein (infusion). Then, the study doctors will check the levels of&#xD;
      pevonedistat in the blood of the participants for 3 days after the infusion. They will also&#xD;
      check if the participants have any side effects from pevonedistat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to continue to Part B. Those who don't want to continue will visit&#xD;
      the clinic 30 days later for a final check-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B Participants who agree to participate into Part B will receive an infusion of&#xD;
      pevonedistat on specific days during a 21-day or 28-day cycle. The cycle time will depend on&#xD;
      what type of cancer the participants have. Participants will also be treated with standard of&#xD;
      care medicines for their kidney and liver problems during this time. In the first cycle, the&#xD;
      study doctors will also check the levels of pevonedistat in the blood and urine of&#xD;
      participants for 3 days after the infusion. Participants will continue with cycles of&#xD;
      treatment together with standard of care medicines until their condition gets worse or they&#xD;
      have too many side effects from the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When treatment has finished, participants will visit the clinic 10 days later for a final&#xD;
      check-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called pevonedistat. The study will characterize the&#xD;
      PK of pevonedistat, assess the safety, and determine the dose of pevonedistat, in combination&#xD;
      with azacitidine, docetaxel OR paclitaxel plus carboplatin in participants with higher-risk&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndromes (HRMDS), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic&#xD;
      leukemia (CMML), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), or advanced solid tumors who also have&#xD;
      severe renal impairment or mild or moderate hepatic impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 42 participants. Participants with solid tumors or&#xD;
      hematologic malignancies will be assigned to one of the four treatment groups on the basis of&#xD;
      their renal and hepatic function:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control Arm (Normal Renal and Hepatic Function)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Renal Arm (Severe Renal Impairment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mild Hepatic Arm (Mild Hepatic Impairment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Moderate Hepatic Arm (Moderate Hepatic Impairment)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in 2 parts: Part A and Part B. Part A will include single dose&#xD;
      administration of pevonedistat. Eligible participants from Part A who will opt to continue&#xD;
      treatment in Part B will be treated with pevonedistat in combination with standard of care&#xD;
      (SOC) agents (azacitidine, docetaxel OR paclitaxel plus carboplatin) in Part B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intrapatient dose escalation of pevonedistat and SOC agents will be based on the safety data&#xD;
      from Cycle 1 of Part B as mentioned below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In renal arm (severe renal impairment ) based on the safety data from Cycle 1 of Part B,&#xD;
           pevonedistat may be increased to 15 mg/m^2 on Days 1, 3, and 5 of Cycle 2 Part B and in&#xD;
           subsequent Cycles, to a maximum dose of 25 mg/m^2. Participants may be eligible for&#xD;
           intrapatient dose escalation to paclitaxel 175 mg/m^2 in Cycle 2 or beyond if the lower&#xD;
           dose is well tolerated. Intrapatient dose escalation of carboplatin to AUC5 will be&#xD;
           allowed if treatment with AUC4 in Cycle 1 of Part B is safe and tolerable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In mild hepatic arm (mild hepatic impairment), the starting dose for pevonedistat and&#xD;
           azacitidine in combination are not escalated in the cohort. Intrapatient dose escalation&#xD;
           of carboplatin to AUC5 will be allowed if treatment with AUC4 in Cycle 1 of Part B is&#xD;
           safe and tolerable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In moderate hepatic arm (moderate hepatic impairment) based on the safety data from&#xD;
           Cycle 1 of Part B, pevonedistat may be increased to 15 mg/m^2 on Days 1, 3, and 5 of&#xD;
           Cycle 2 Part B and in subsequent Cycles, to a maximum dose of 20 mg/m^2. Intrapatient&#xD;
           dose escalation of carboplatin to AUC5 will be allowed if treatment with AUC4 in Cycle 1&#xD;
           of Part B is safe and tolerable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States and Spain. The overall time to&#xD;
      participate in this study is approximately 3.5 years. Participants will attend end of the&#xD;
      study visit 30 days after the last dose of study drug or before the start of subsequent&#xD;
      therapy, if that occurs sooner for safety follow up.&#xD;

    <description>Disease response in AML are based on international working group (IWG) for diagnosis, standardization of response criteria, treatment outcomes, and reporting standards for therapeutic trials in AML. For AML participants, all CR includes both CR and CRi.
