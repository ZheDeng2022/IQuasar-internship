  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      to solve the problem of hypersensitivity, I will use two different materials ( Giomer versus&#xD;
      Sodium Fluoride) and compare between their effects in reliving the symptoms&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The dentin hypersensitivity is characterized by short, sharp pain which can be detected by&#xD;
      several methods. The problem is very annoying for the patients and making them seek for&#xD;
      effective rapid treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It can affect several teeth in one area of the mouth or only one specific tooth. Careful&#xD;
      diagnosis of such condition necessitates precise differentiation of its signs and symptoms&#xD;
      from the other causes of tooth sensitivity which may be resulted from dental caries, micro&#xD;
      leakage, cracked tooth or fractured restoration. There are two well-known ways to reduce the&#xD;
      discomfort of the hypersensitivity either by blocking the exposed dentinal tubules by&#xD;
      occluding materials or use some depolarizing agents that reducing the excitability of the&#xD;
      intra dental nerves.Most of the desensitizing agents reduces the dentin hypersensitivity by&#xD;
      its own way and each one has different long lasting effect. But there are some drawbacks that&#xD;
      appeared with their use. Fluoride based agents were appeared in 90's but it was clarified&#xD;
      that their high concentration irritated the odontoblasts. Furthermore, the oxalates and&#xD;
      potassium nitrate were introduced to treat the hypersensitivity effectively but their effects&#xD;
      did not persist for a long period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sodium fluoride varnish is one from the most commonly used desensitizing agent and its&#xD;
      efficacy was approved in many studies. The Giomer varnish containing surface pre-reactive&#xD;
      glass particles (S-PRG) is a light-cured protective varnish and it was introduced to promote&#xD;
      prolonged protection for the hypersensitive dentin.&#xD;
