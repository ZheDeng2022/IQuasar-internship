  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transesophageal ultrasound offers imaging through the esophagus on the surface of the heart,&#xD;
      with good image quality and unique advantages. However, no studies to date have examined its&#xD;
      effect in critically ill patients in China.Therefore, the investigators aimed to compare the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of TEE with TTE. the investigators will conducte a Multi-center,&#xD;
      prospective observational control study enrolling critically ill adult patients in several&#xD;
      ICU in China .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients in ICU were assessed for the need for TEE by trained researcher. Eligible patients&#xD;
      would be conducted tee examination by researcher A, TTE by the researcher B ,at the same&#xD;
      time, researcher C records the basic condition and clinical data of patientsand carried out&#xD;
      micro-enlargement test.The examination results are judged by A and B respectively and&#xD;
      provided to the physician of this patient, and A return visit to the physician wold be&#xD;
      conducted by researcher D to evaluate the acceptance of TTE and TEE results and judge the&#xD;
      clinical effects. The primary outcome is the clinical effects.&#xD;
