  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the Phase I portion of the study is to assess the therapeutic safety&#xD;
      and preliminary efficacy of a hematopoietic cell-based gene therapy consisting of autologous&#xD;
      CD34+ enriched cells transduced with the therapeutic lentiviral vector, Chim-CD18-WPRE,&#xD;
      RP-L201. The primary objectives of the Phase II portion of the study are evaluation of&#xD;
      survival, as determined by the proportion of subjects alive at age 2 (24 months) and at least&#xD;
      1-year post-infusion without allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and&#xD;
      characterization of the safety and toxicity associated with the infusion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pediatric non-randomized open-label Phase I/II clinical trial. The Phase I portion&#xD;
      will include a safety evaluation and preliminary assessment of the efficacy of hematopoietic&#xD;
      gene therapy consisting of autologous CD34+ enriched cells transduced with a lentiviral&#xD;
      vector carrying the ITGB2 gene in subjects with severe LAD-I. CD34+ cells will be transduced&#xD;
      ex vivo with the therapeutic vector followed by cryopreservation. If the number of CD34+&#xD;
      cells that are available for infusion is at least 2x10e6 total CD34+ cells/kg, subjects will&#xD;
      undergo myeloablative conditioning with intravenous busulfan. Subjects will then receive&#xD;
      infusion of gene-corrected hematopoietic cells approximately 24 hours following the final&#xD;
      busulfan dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The active agent is a self-inactivating lentiviral vector carrying the therapeutic ITGB2&#xD;
      gene, encoding for the human CD18 receptor (β2 integrin subunit). The therapeutic product is&#xD;
      the subject's autologous hematopoietic stem cells that have been transduced with the&#xD;
      lentiviral vector.&#xD;

          -  A confirmed diagnosis of severe LAD-I as demonstrated by flow cytometry indicating&#xD;
             CD18 expression on &lt;2% neutrophils (polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs)). Subjects in&#xD;
             which CD18+ PMNs are &gt;2% will be considered eligible with &lt;2% CD11a or CD11b&#xD;
             expressing PMNs and if there is a documented ITGB2 mutation and clinical history&#xD;

             participate in the consent process. (Informed assent will be sought from capable&#xD;
             subjects, in accordance with the directive of the IRB/EC and with local requirements).&#xD;

             clinically-indicated and feasible HLA-matched sibling donor hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
             transplant. If an HLA-identical sibling is identified, but mobilized peripheral blood&#xD;
             or bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell collection is not feasible (for example: donor&#xD;
             is in utero, is a newborn from whom cord blood was not collected, or is unable to&#xD;
             undergo donation procedure because of medical impairments), then inclusion may be&#xD;
             permitted per Investigator discretion.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Need for supplemental oxygen during the prior 2 weeks (in absence of acute&#xD;
                  infection).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Oxygen saturation (by pulse oximetry) &lt;90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of active metastatic or locoregionally advanced malignancy (including&#xD;
             hematologic malignancy) for which survival is anticipated to be less than 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious infections with persistent bloodstream pathogens at time of trial entry.&#xD;

             thromboembolic events (including stroke or myocardial infarction) within the 6 prior&#xD;
             months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any medical or psychiatric condition that in the opinion of the Investigator renders&#xD;
             the subject unfit for trial participation or at higher than acceptable risk for&#xD;
