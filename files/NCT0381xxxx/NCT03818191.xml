  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AUDs are difficult to treat, and relapse rates are high, with an estimated 80% of individuals&#xD;
      with AUDs returning to alcohol use after completing addictions treatment. Novel treatment&#xD;
      approaches are needed to enhance long term sobriety. The investigator's research team has&#xD;
      been investigating the use of acamprosate to prevent relapse to alcohol use. Unfortunately&#xD;
      despite being FDA approved and endorsed by the American Psychiatric Association only 10% of&#xD;
      patients treated for AUD are prescribed acamprosate or other antidipsotropic medications. The&#xD;
      number is higher for patients treated in programs affiliated with Mayo Clinic Addiction&#xD;
      Services (approximately 20%) but is way less than expected. The most common reasons behind&#xD;
      these low numbers are the understanding that not every patient benefits from the use of&#xD;
      specific medication and the lack of biomarkers predictive of response. The purpose of this&#xD;
      project is to identify such biomarkers by discovery of genomic and metabolomic markers&#xD;
      associated with response to acamprosate treatment.&#xD;
