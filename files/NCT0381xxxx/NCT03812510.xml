    <description>Safety exposure will be measured by the proportion of subjects exposed to A-101 45% who have emergent adverse events. In order to be eligible for A-101-WART-303, subjects must have completed protocol treatment on either the A-101-WART-301 or A-101-WART-302 study. The A-101-WART-303 study was an open-label with a single arm where all subjects received A-101 Topical Solution 45% twice a week. Since A-101-WART-303 is an extension study, statistical analyses were performed by stratifying patients by treatment arms in the A-101-WART-301 or A-101-WART-302 studies. In the A-101-WART-303 study, subjects will be followed every 6 weeks to assess for a recurrence or development of new common warts. If a recurrence occurs or a new wart develops these subjects may return to the site to receive A-101 Topical Solution 45% twice a week for an additional treatment cycle of 8 weeks.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>In order to be eligible for A-101-WART-303, subjects must have completed protocol treatment on either the A-101-WART-301 or A-101-WART-302 study. The A-101-WART-303 study was an open-label with a single arm where all subjects received A-101 Topical Solution 45% twice a week. Since A-101-WART-303 is an extension study, statistical analyses were performed by stratifying patients by treatment arms in the A-101-WART-301 or A-101-WART-302 studies.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>In the A-101-WART-303 study, subjects will be followed every 6 weeks to assess for a recurrence or development of new common warts. If a recurrence occurs or a new wart develops these subjects may return to the site to receive A-101 Topical Solution 45% twice a week for an additional treatment cycle of 8 weeks.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>A-101 Hydrogen Peroxide Topical Solution 45%</title>
          <description>In order to be eligible for A-101-WART-303, subjects must have completed protocol treatment on either the A-101-WART-301 or A-101-WART-302 study. The A-101-WART-303 study was an open-label with a single arm where all subjects received A-101 Topical Solution 45% twice a week. Since A-101-WART-303 is an extension study, statistical analyses were performed by stratifying patients by treatment arms in the A-101-WART-301 or A-101-WART-302 studies. However, Baseline Measures were collected as a single arm for the study.</description>

        <title>Proportion of Subjects With Treatment Emergent AEs After Application of A-101 45% for the Treatment of Common Warts</title>
        <description>Safety exposure will be measured by the proportion of subjects exposed to A-101 45% who have emergent adverse events. In order to be eligible for A-101-WART-303, subjects must have completed protocol treatment on either the A-101-WART-301 or A-101-WART-302 study. The A-101-WART-303 study was an open-label with a single arm where all subjects received A-101 Topical Solution 45% twice a week. Since A-101-WART-303 is an extension study, statistical analyses were performed by stratifying patients by treatment arms in the A-101-WART-301 or A-101-WART-302 studies. In the A-101-WART-303 study, subjects will be followed every 6 weeks to assess for a recurrence or development of new common warts. If a recurrence occurs or a new wart develops these subjects may return to the site to receive A-101 Topical Solution 45% twice a week for an additional treatment cycle of 8 weeks.</description>

          <title>Time to Clearance of All Warts Warts by Treatment Group and Treatment Cycle (Treatment Cycle 1)</title>
          <description>Safety exposure will be measured by the proportion of subjects exposed to A-101 45% who have emergent adverse events. In order to be eligible for A-101-WART-303, subjects must have completed protocol treatment on either the A-101-WART-301 or A-101-WART-302 study. The A-101-WART-303 study was an open-label with a single arm where all subjects received A-101 Topical Solution 45% twice a week. Since A-101-WART-303 is an extension study, statistical analyses were performed by stratifying patients by treatment arms in the A-101-WART-301 or A-101-WART-302 studies.&#xD;
The median was unable to be calculated, so the 25th percentile was used as the time to achieve onset of Clearance (PWA=0) for all treated warts. Efficacy will be assessed using the Physician's Wart Assessment Scale (PWA) which is a 4 point scale. A higher amount of warts cleared represents a better outcome.</description>
