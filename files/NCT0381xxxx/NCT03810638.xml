  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators goal is to create a digital registry that allows for seamless integration&#xD;
      of patient reported outcomes, electronic health record data, and pharmacy information into&#xD;
      data collection. The investigators will accomplish this using a novel patient centered mobile&#xD;
      health platform called Hugo that will allow them to engage patients in an entirely novel&#xD;
      manner.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is the most common cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States and in&#xD;
      Western Europe. It is a complex and chronic illness, and patient journeys vary considerably.&#xD;
      However, to date, guidance about how to best treat patients has relied on large clinical&#xD;
      international trials that do not represent contemporary patients and only include snapshots&#xD;
      of the syndrome-at times when the patients interact with the health care system.&#xD;
      Additionally, patient participation in clinical research in the US is extremely low,&#xD;
      approximated at 3% in cancer and far lower for disease states such as heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the key reasons for this is a lack of patient engagement and trust in the research&#xD;
      enterprise, especially among the elderly and minorities, groups that are disproportionally&#xD;
      impacted by heart failure. To address this, the investigators plan to test a novel&#xD;
      patient-powered, smartphone-based mobile health platform (called Hugo) developed at Yale&#xD;
      School of Medicine for real-world surveillance of patient reported outcomes in heart failure&#xD;
      patients treated at 3 Major Academic Medical Centers. Participants will then be queried about&#xD;
      specific symptoms and health conditions at enrollment and prespecified time points for 2&#xD;
      years. The subgroup of participants who own devices that track their activity data will have&#xD;
      the option of syncing them to this mobile health platform to provide additional insights into&#xD;
      their health and health outcomes. Additionally, participants will have the option to learn&#xD;
      about opportunities to participate in heart failure clinical research. This digital registry&#xD;
      will also allow seamless integration of patient reported outcomes, electronic health record&#xD;
      (EHR) data, and pharmacy information into data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, the aim for this study is to create a digital registry using a novel patient&#xD;
      centered mobile health platform of heart failure patients across large health care systems&#xD;
      that allows investigators to engage patients in an entirely novel manner.&#xD;
