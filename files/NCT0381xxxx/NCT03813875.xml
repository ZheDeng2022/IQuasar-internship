  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Demand for anesthesiologists outside the operating rooms is increasing. Surgeons,&#xD;
      radiologists, endoscopists and other interventionists are performing procedures with greater&#xD;
      complexity, sometimes accompanied by greater pain and therefore require some sedation. This&#xD;
      growing need place a pivotal role on careful handling the delivered drugs. Specifically, the&#xD;
      investigators wish to know how different classes of drugs interact in order for us to titrate&#xD;
      the effects more precisely. Early studies used isobolograms and concentration effect curves&#xD;
      as their tools but these methods are limited and incapable of making continuous bedside&#xD;
      monitoring. Researchers integrated these methodologies mathematically and developed response&#xD;
      surface models. It's becoming a very convenient tool to assess drug interactions. Drug&#xD;
      interactions are visualized with a three dimensional graph, or a surface. Users will only&#xD;
      need the calculated drug concentrations and a predicted loss of response probability will be&#xD;
      given after a model is built. The process of model construction is complex and time demanding&#xD;
      process. Our team has successfully built a dual-drug model for midazolam and alfentanil and&#xD;
      several works have been published in renowned anesthesia journals. Dual-drug models are&#xD;
      simple but their use is very limited. The investigators often use more than two drugs during&#xD;
      practice and a three-drug model will be a great leap to monitor clinical pharmacodynamics.&#xD;
      The investigators will collect vital signs, anesthestic depth (BIS=bispectral index,&#xD;
      analgesia nociception index (ANI)), drug dosing (propofol, midazolam and alfentanil), and the&#xD;
      MOAA/S (modified observer's assessment/alertness score) scores in patient who are receive&#xD;
      routine general anesthesia under laryngeal mask or sedation for TEE (transesophageal&#xD;
      echocardiography) examinations. Patient's consent will be obtained prior to enrollment. These&#xD;
      recordings will be pooled into computer program for model construction. A novel model in the&#xD;
      field of anesthesia was chosen and modified. As pioneers in this field in Taiwan, the&#xD;
      investigators plan to perform a series of analysis using a novel model the investigators have&#xD;
      built to look into detail on how drugs interact with each other. A safety boundary to avoid&#xD;
      excessive respiratory depression can be drawn by the model. The main goal is to provide&#xD;
      sedation that gives precision, patient comfort, rapid return of consciousness and safety&#xD;
      based on the triple-drug response surface model.&#xD;

      This is an observational study of the routine clinical practice with no specific additional&#xD;
      interventions required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data acquisition (TEE patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. After screening for eligible patients, protocol and study details will be thoroughly&#xD;
           explained to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Strict fasting protocols were followed. A 22-gauge intravenous catheter was secured for&#xD;
           drug administration. Each patient received standard anesthetic care monitors comprised&#xD;
           of ECG (electrocardiography), oxygenation saturation (SpO2) and NIBP (non-invasive blood&#xD;
           pressure). ECG and SpO2 (oxygenation saturation) were monitored continuously and NIBP&#xD;
           were measured every 5 minutes. Supplemental oxygen (3~5 L/m) was given via nasal&#xD;
           cannula, and SpO2 (oxygenation saturation) maintained above 90%. Intravenous bolus&#xD;
           midazolam, alfentanil and propofol were given according to the anesthesiologist's&#xD;
           preferences. Reference dosage range for midazolam is 0~5mg, alfentanil 0~1000mcg and&#xD;
           propofol 0~60mg. Anesthetic depth was monitored with BIS and analgesia nociception index&#xD;
           (ANI). BIS and ANI (analgesia nociception index) were for monitoring purposes only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Instrumentation began after loss of response as evaluated by the anesthesiologist with&#xD;
           the modified observer's assessment/alertness scale (MOAA/S). Intolerable desaturation&#xD;
           was managed with mask ventilation or insertion of a nasal airway. An MOAA/S score lesser&#xD;
           than 2 was considered loss of response (LOR) and fit for instrumentation. MOAA/S score&#xD;
           would be recorded at induction, instrumentation, and emergence phase. Recordings will be&#xD;
           added if patient had a MOAA/S score greater than 2. ANI (analgesia nociception index)&#xD;
           and forehead BIS monitors will be used as an adjunct to assess anesthetic depth.&#xD;
           Additional drug boluses were given if the patient expresses pain or excessive movements&#xD;
           observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. At the end of the procedure, the patient was observed until return of consciousness&#xD;
           (MOAA/S &gt; 5). The patients will be randomly divided into a model training group and a&#xD;
           validation group after data acquisition by computer randomization using computer clock&#xD;
           as seed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data acquisition (Laryngeal mask patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. After screening for eligible patients, protocol and study details will be thoroughly&#xD;
           explained to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Strict fasting protocols were followed. A 22 or 20-gauge intravenous catheter was&#xD;
           secured for drug administration. Each patient received standard anesthetic care monitors&#xD;
           comprised of electrocardiography (ECG), SpO2 (oxygen saturation) and non-invasive blood&#xD;
           pressure (NIBP). ECG and SpO2 (oxygen saturation) were monitored continuously and NIBP&#xD;
           were measured every 5 minutes. Intravenous fentanyl and propofol were given according to&#xD;
           the anesthesiologist's preferences. Reference dosage range for fentanyl 0~150mcg and&#xD;
           propofol 0~200mg. Anesthetic depth was monitored with BIS and ANI (analgesia nociception&#xD;
           index). BIS and ANI were for monitoring purposes only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Instrumentation began after loss of response as evaluated by the anesthesiologist with&#xD;
           the MOAA/S score. A MOAA/S score lesser than 2 was considered LOR (loss of response) and&#xD;
           fit for instrumentation. After LMA placement, sevoflurane was started at 2~3% with a&#xD;
           fresh gas flow at 1~6 L/m. The end-tidal sevoflurane concentration would be maintained&#xD;
           above 0.7 minimal alveolar concentration to avoid awareness. MOAA/S score would be&#xD;
           recorded at induction, instrumentation, during skin incision/closure and emergence&#xD;
           phase. Recordings would be added if patient had a MOAA/S score greater than 2. ANI&#xD;
           (analgesia nociception index) and forehead BIS monitors would be used as an adjunct to&#xD;
           assess anesthetic depth. Additional drug boluses were given if the patient expresses&#xD;
           pain or excessive movements observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. At the end of the procedure, LMA was removed if the patient was breathing smoothly. The&#xD;
           patient was observed until return of consciousness (MOAA/S &gt; 5). The patients will be&#xD;
           randomly divided into a model training group and a validation group after data&#xD;
           acquisition by computer randomization using computer clock as seed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Model building, assessment and validation (both groups)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Collected data were fed to a pharmacokinetic simulation software (TIVA trainer Version&#xD;
           9.1) to calculate second-by-second plasma and effect-site drug concentration changes for&#xD;
           all three drugs. The training patient group is used for model training. The bootstrap&#xD;
           technique is used with 2000 iterations. Model fit was optimized using -2 Log likelihood&#xD;
           (-2LL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. MOAA/S, BIS and ANI (analgesia nociception index) models would be constructed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The results are validated with the validation patient data to confirm its clinical&#xD;
           utility. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis is used to assess the&#xD;
           quality of model prediction. ROC and area under the curve (AUC) will be compared between&#xD;
           the training and validation group.&#xD;
