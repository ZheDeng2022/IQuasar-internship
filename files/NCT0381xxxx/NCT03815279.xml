      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of treating patients with intermediate&#xD;
      risk smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) with combinational therapy with dexamethasone and&#xD;
      lenalidomide (Rd) and patients with high risk SMM with combinational therapy with Rd and&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single center, phase II study assessing the efficacy of treating&#xD;
      patients with intermediate-risk smoldering myeloma (SMM) with combinational therapy with&#xD;
      dexamethasone and lenalidomide and treating patients with high risk SMM and active multiple&#xD;
      myeloma (MM) with combinational therapy with dexamethasone, lenalidomide and carfilzomib.&#xD;
