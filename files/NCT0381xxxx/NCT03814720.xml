  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The flu is a common viral infection that can be deadly for certain people. Vaccines against&#xD;
      flu have been developed to teach the body to prevent or fight the infection. A new vaccine&#xD;
      may help the body to make an immune response to H1 flu, a flu strain that infects humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the safety and effectiveness of the H1 Stabilized Stem Ferritin vaccine&#xD;
      (VRC-FLUNPF099-00-VP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy people ages 18-70 years old who got at least 1 licensed flu vaccine since January 1,&#xD;
      2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 1 or 2 vaccination visits over 4 months. Each will take about 4-6&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will get the vaccine by injections (shots) in the upper arm muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who can get pregnant will have a pregnancy test before each injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After each vaccination, participants will complete a diary card for 7 days. They will record&#xD;
      their temperature, skin changes, and any symptoms that they may have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 9-11 follow-up visits over 12-15 months. They will be checked for any&#xD;
      health changes or problems. They will give blood samples and may give nose and throat swabs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have apheresis. A needle will be placed into a vein in both arms. Blood will&#xD;
      be removed through a needle in the vein of one arm. A machine will remove the white blood&#xD;
      cells and then the rest of the blood is returned to the participant through a needle in the&#xD;
      other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may sign a separate consent for genetic testing on their samples.&#xD;

      Study Design: This is a Phase I, open-label, dose escalation study to evaluate the dose,&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of VRC-FLUNPF099-00-VP in two regimens. The&#xD;
      hypotheses are that the vaccine is safe and tolerable and will elicit an immune response. The&#xD;
      primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the investigational vaccine&#xD;
      in healthy adults. Secondary objectives are related to immunogenicity of the investigational&#xD;
      vaccine and dosing regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Products: The investigational vaccine, VRC-FLUNPF099-00-VP (H1ssF_3928), was developed&#xD;
      by the Vaccine Research Center (VRC), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases&#xD;
      (NIAID) and is composed of Helicobacter pylori non-heme ferritin assembled with influenza&#xD;
      virus H1 haemagglutinin (HA) insert to form a nanoparticle displaying eight HA stabilized&#xD;
      stem trimers from A/New Caledonia/20/1999 (H1N1) influenza. The vaccine is supplied in&#xD;
      single-use vials at a concentration of 180 mcg/mL. H1ssF_3928 will be administered&#xD;
      intramuscularly (IM) in the deltoid muscle via needle and syringe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Healthy adults between the ages of 18-70 years, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Plan: The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of 1 or 2&#xD;
      doses of the H1ssF_3928 vaccine in a dose-escalation design. In Group 1, five subjects will&#xD;
      receive a single low dose (20 mcg) of H1ssF_3928 on Day 0. For Group 1, the protocol requires&#xD;
      1 vaccination visit, about 9 follow-up visits, and a telephone contact after vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the low dose is assessed as safe and well tolerated, enrollment will begin for Group 2A.&#xD;
      Groups 2A, 2B, 2C, and 2D are stratified by age as shown in the vaccination schema. In Group&#xD;
      2A, subjects will receive a higher dose (60 mcg) of H1ssF_3928 on Day 0. If this higher dose&#xD;
      is assessed as safe and well tolerated, subjects in Group 2A may receive a second vaccination&#xD;
      at week 16 and enrollment can begin for Groups 2B, 2C, and 2D. For Groups 2A, 2B, 2C, and 2D,&#xD;
      the protocol requires 2 vaccination visits, about 11 follow-up visits, and a telephone&#xD;
      contact after each vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all groups, solicited reactogenicity will be evaluated using a 7-day diary card.&#xD;
      Assessment of vaccine safety will include clinical observation and monitoring of&#xD;
      hematological and chemical parameters at clinical visits throughout the study.&#xD;
