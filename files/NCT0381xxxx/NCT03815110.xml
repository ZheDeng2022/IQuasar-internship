      The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identify a cut-off for the ratio of the serum proteins soluble FMS-like Tyrosine Kinase&#xD;
           1 (sFLT-1) and placental growth factor (PlGF) that identifies women will who develop&#xD;
           preeclampsia with severe features within 2 weeks of testing (clinically positive) from&#xD;
           those who do not develop preeclampsia with severe features within 2 weeks of testing&#xD;
           (clinically negative) among preterm pregnant women with hypertensive disorders of&#xD;
           pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           And&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To validate the cut-off the ratio of sFLT-1 and PlGF and to validate the performance of&#xD;
           the automated assays used to find the cut-off. Test performance includes positive&#xD;
           predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity, and specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will provide blood, urine, and saliva samples at the time of enrollment. Samples&#xD;
      will be frozen for batch assessment of sFLT-1 and PlGF levels by automated assays.&#xD;
      Clinicians, subjects, and researchers will be blinded to protein level assessment, therefore&#xD;
      assay results will not affect clinical management.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preeclampsia is a leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality in the US, and&#xD;
      affects about 5% of pregnancies. Despite its morbidity, preeclampsia is challenging to&#xD;
      distinguish from worsening chronic hypertension or gestational hypertension. Furthermore, it&#xD;
      is challenging to identify who among those with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy will&#xD;
      develop preeclampsia with severe features, including kidney, liver, pulmonary, or cerebral&#xD;
      injury. The only definitive treatment is delivery of the placenta, and therefore the fetus,&#xD;
      which can lead to severe morbidity and mortality to the neonate if delivery is very&#xD;
      premature. New methods of risk stratification are needed to identify who among women with&#xD;
      hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are at risk of developing preeclampsia with severe&#xD;
      features in order to allocate resources (e.g. betamethasone and magnesium for fetal&#xD;
      neuroprotection) accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several serum proteins (sFLT-1 and PlGF) correlate well with the development of preeclampsia,&#xD;
      particularly with preeclampsia with severe features, and may be used to predict the&#xD;
      development of preeclampsia with severe features within a certain timeframe. The goal of this&#xD;
      study is to identify a cut-off of the sFLT-1/PlGF ratio using automated assays that&#xD;
      differentiates women who will develop preeclampsia with severe features from those who will&#xD;
      not among women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy within 2 weeks of testing. The&#xD;
      secondary outcomes include time to delivery, the performance of the cut-off to predict&#xD;
      adverse maternal and adverse fetal outcomes, and a comparison of the performance of the&#xD;
      cut-off with clinical and laboratory factors per American College of Obstetricians and&#xD;
      Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines. Investigators will also look at the levels of sFLT-1 and&#xD;
      PlGF in the urine and the saliva to determine if they correlate well with serum levels and&#xD;
      may provide a less invasive alternative to serum samples.&#xD;
