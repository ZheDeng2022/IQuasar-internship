    <textblock>
      Clinical objectives: estimate the common effect of the EfiKroniK physical exercise program&#xD;
      for people with a set of Chronic diseases (solid cancers, hematological, schizophrenia and&#xD;
      COPD), expressed in terms of functional capacity, quality of life and others results,&#xD;
      regarding the standardized intervention of healthy habits 'Prescribe Healthy Living 'PVS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation objectives: describe the adherence, continuity, adequacy and usefulness of&#xD;
      EfiKroniK perceived by patients and professionals, with the purpose of designing&#xD;
      implementation strategies, which will be evaluated in future trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: clinical trial and implementation, pragmatic and randomized to two groups stratified&#xD;
      by pathology, followed for 12 m.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: 370 patients diagnosed with solid cancers, hematological cancers, schizophrenia&#xD;
      and COPD, in the most advanced stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scope: Hospital de Cruces, Basque Country University, Primary Care Research Unit of Bizkaia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: personalized exercise program for patients, supervised during 3 months by&#xD;
      nursing in primary and autonomous care afterwards, with support from community resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reference group: PVS program, of proven effectiveness for the promotion of physical activity,&#xD;
      diet and smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements: main measure of results: functional capacity at 3 months (6-minute test and&#xD;
      submaximal running / running tests at foot to determine the speed of lactate thresholds) and&#xD;
      quality of life at 6 and 12 months (SF-36 and specific questionnaires by pathology).&#xD;
      Secondary variable results: physical and psychic symptomatology, biological markers, physical&#xD;
      form and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: The common effect of the exercise will be estimated by comparing both groups by&#xD;
      intention to treat, by means of analysis of the covariance of mixed effects for the changes&#xD;
      observed at 3, 6 and 12 months adjusted for the baseline and possible confounders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously, a possible interaction effect between the pathology group and the effect of the&#xD;
      intervention will be ruled out. The cost-effectiveness and cost-utility reasons.&#xD;

      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a multicentre pragmatic open-label type I hybrid implementation-effectiveness&#xD;
      trial, in which a total of 370 patients each with one of 4 different chronic conditions,&#xD;
      namely, solid cancer (n=100) and blood cancers (n=70), COPD (n=100) or schizophrenia (n=100),&#xD;
      will be randomised to one of two parallel groups, stratified by illness type: the EfiKroniK&#xD;
      group (EG) (tailored exercise supervised by fitness and health professionals) or the&#xD;
      reference group (PVS group) (36). We deliberately opted to study diverse illnesses seeking to&#xD;
      demonstrate any common effect of physical exercise across all of them, independent of any&#xD;
      additional effects on each condition separately, and for this purpose, this design is much&#xD;
      more efficient than separate clinical trials for each illness. Cardiorespiratory functional&#xD;
      capacity at 3, 6 and 12 months and quality of life at baseline at 6 and 12 months will be&#xD;
      considered the primary outcome variables, and will compare changes over time in both groups.&#xD;
      Additionally, we will explore the perceptions of participants and professionals in terms of&#xD;
      the feasibility of the programme, as well as the barriers and facilitators for adherence and&#xD;
      continuity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are required to be between 18 and 75 years old and diagnosed with: stage IV&#xD;

      Status score ≥ 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria Patients are to be excluded if they have brain metastasis, high risk of&#xD;
      fracture due to bone metastasis, severe emotional instability, cardiorespiratory compromise&#xD;
      or uncontrolled infection; relapse or progression of blood cancer; alterations in&#xD;
      communication or significant cognitive impairment that might hinder data collection;&#xD;

      prevent them from following the exercise programme; or uncontrolled high blood pressure&#xD;
      (systolic &gt;200 or diastolic &gt;110 mmHg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment The Oncology, Haematology and Pulmonology services, primary care doctors and the&#xD;
      Mental Health Network of Bizkaia have established an active surveillance system to identify&#xD;
      patients with the chronic conditions under study. Doctors will inform patients about the&#xD;
      study and invite them to participate. After signing an informed consent form, patients will&#xD;
      be referred by the study coordination group to their primary care doctor who will gather&#xD;
      baseline data. Before each patient's group allocation is known, a fitness and health&#xD;
      professional will measure the study variables at baseline and provide the standardised&#xD;
      healthy lifestyle prescription, encouraging physical activity, a balanced diet and smoking&#xD;
      cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation Once informed consent has been obtained and baseline measurements taken,&#xD;
      patients will be randomised blindly and centrally to either the EG or PVS group, stratified&#xD;
      by illness type, at the coordinating centre, the Primary care Research Unit of Bizkaia of the&#xD;
      Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute. The randomization will be performed using&#xD;
      computer-generated random numbers in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by illness type, with a block&#xD;
      size of 4 or 6.(Fig.1) Protocol for the PVS group On recruitment, all participants will&#xD;
      receive a standard healthy lifestyle prescription, encouraging physical activity, a balanced&#xD;
      diet and smoking cessation, using the PVS computer tool, which is integrated into the&#xD;
      electronic health record. In addition to other measurements at 3, 6 and 12 months, the&#xD;
      follow-up will include assessment of potential changes in these habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol for the EfiKroniK group First phase: the EfiKroniK group are to participate in an&#xD;
      innovative physical exercise programme supervised by fitness and health professionals,&#xD;
      ensuring patient safety and adjusting the intensity of the exercise to each patient. In this&#xD;
      phase, patients are to develop the skills necessary to become an expert regarding the ideal&#xD;
      dose of exercise for them. It consists of 36 sessions of exercise of progressively increasing&#xD;
      intensity and tailored to the physical condition of each patient, assessed based on metabolic&#xD;
      thresholds. Two sessions a week are to be performed in the laboratory, combining aerobic and&#xD;
      strength exercises with stretching, under the supervision of fitness and health professionals&#xD;
      and one session a week independently near the health centre, monitored with a HR monitor&#xD;
      programmed by the fitness and health professionals. In addition to HR measured with the&#xD;
      monitor, exercise is monitored with the modified Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion Scale (37)&#xD;
      and the appearance of any symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second phase: In this phase, patients are to work independently following a physical exercise&#xD;
      programme similar to that of the first phase, taking advantage of resources in the community.&#xD;
      To make this feasible, patients are to have been trained during the first phase in the type&#xD;
      of exercise and appropriate intensity (Borg Scale,HR monitor, symptoms), and at the end of&#xD;
      the 3-month training programme, we will contact individuals who can provide support in the&#xD;
      community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will calculate the real dose of physical exercise each person has been exposed to:&#xD;
      cumulative metabolic equivalent (MET)*h/week and time spent doing moderate and/or vigorous&#xD;
      intensity of exercise and intensity of exercise under supervision based on the percentage of&#xD;
      heart rate reserve (HRR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensity of aerobic exercise: The American College of Sports Medicine recommends doing at&#xD;
      least 150 minutes/week of moderate or 75 minutes/week of vigorous physical activity or a&#xD;
      combination of both (38). Regarding the definition of relative intensity, 45-59% of the HRR&#xD;
      corresponds to a moderate intensity. Use of this indicator, however, implies carrying out a&#xD;
      maximum stress test, the results of which may be distorted by the high degree of fatigue,&#xD;
      weakened immune system and reduced peripheral muscle strength of patients who are receiving&#xD;
      intensive treatments and have a low level of fitness (28). Furthermore, at the same relative&#xD;
      intensity (59% of HRR), the metabolic response varies greatly between individuals (21). For&#xD;
      these reasons, we will measure MLs in each patient to allow us to: 1) assess patient aerobic&#xD;
      capacity and changes therein, given their strong association with maximum rate of oxygen&#xD;
      consumption (VO2max), and 2) ensure patient safety and provide them with a level of metabolic&#xD;
      stimulus that is similar across patients and effective in improving biochemical parameters&#xD;
      (e.g., reduction in inflammation and improvements in the immune system, blood glucose levels&#xD;
      and lipid profile). In particular, the aerobic threshold (LT) can be used in this way given&#xD;
      the parallel response between the exponential increase in lactate concentrations that occurs&#xD;
      after this LT and the secretion of catecholamines, neurotrophic hormones associated with&#xD;
      improvements in cognitive function (BDNF) and anti-inflammatory interleukins (IL-6) involved&#xD;
      in reductions in tumour size and reproducibility (39).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two lactate thresholds will be used as a reference for designing exercise intensity zones&#xD;
      for each patient, in terms of speed and HR as well as perceived exertion. The speed at the LT&#xD;
      or aerobic threshold determined during an incremental lactate test and the corresponding HR&#xD;
      will define the lower limit of the moderate intensity zone. On the other hand, the speed at&#xD;
      the threshold, considered the anaerobic threshold, used the measure the maximal lactate&#xD;
      steady state (MLSS) (38) and the corresponding HR will be taken as the upper limit of the&#xD;
      moderate intensity zone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the individual MLs, we will design five intensity zones. The zone of low-intensity&#xD;
      training (LIT) corresponds to exercise carried out at a HR lower than the LT (~20% of the&#xD;
      HRR) and the zone of moderate intensity zone to exercise carried out between the LT and the&#xD;
      MLSS (~20-85% of HRR or between 1-2.3 Mmol/L), this in turn being divided into three&#xD;
      equally-sized zones: low-moderate (M1), medium-moderate (M2) and high-moderate (M3)&#xD;
      intensity. Finally, the zone of high-intensity training (HIT) (&gt;MLSS, &gt;~85% of the HRR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first month, participants will start carrying out sessions involving endurance&#xD;
      exercise, which will be divided into 3 intervals of 8 minutes each at an M2 intensity,&#xD;
      alternating with 2 minutes at an M1 intensity. In the session in which patients work&#xD;
      independently, they will be monitored with HR monitor and it will be explained that they&#xD;
      should exercise for 30 minutes and for as much of that time as possible at M1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the second month, the maximum intensity of the intervals will increase to M3, nearing&#xD;
      the anaerobic threshold HR. Specifically, the fully supervised exercise will be divided into&#xD;
      four intervals of 5 minutes at M3, alternating with 3 minutes at M1, while the indirectly&#xD;
      monitored (semi-supervised) session will be of 30 minutes at M2 (Figure 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three months after the beginning of the project, the assessments are to be repeated and new&#xD;
      intensity zones prescribed, in line with changes in functional capacity as assessed by the&#xD;
      lactate tests. At this point, patients are to be given a report of the results of these&#xD;
      assessments together with guidelines for exercising independently during the following&#xD;
      months. During the same appointment, we will explain to patients how to use the HR zones&#xD;
      prescribed during exercise and we will warn them about any potential risk factors detected&#xD;
      (39,40). Given that a relatively high proportion of people on the same training programme do&#xD;
      not show a good response in various metabolic parameters (41), patients who adapt well to the&#xD;
      training will be recommended to continue exercising at a moderate-high intensity (M3), while&#xD;
      those with a poorer response will be encouraged to continue their training at least at low-&#xD;
      to medium-moderate intensities (M1-M2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strength and endurance exercises: Strength training is a key element of the exercise&#xD;
      programme in these conditions which are associated with reduced peripheral muscle strength&#xD;
      and a low level of fitness. The approach taken consists of exercising the largest muscle&#xD;
      groups at high speed and moderate intensity with a moderate load. In each session, 5&#xD;
      exercises are performed involving major muscle groups, namely, the chest, quadriceps, back,&#xD;
      hamstring and gluteal muscles, as well as the shoulder, these being performed in 2-3 series&#xD;
      of 8-12 repetitions of 16-20 possible exercises (~55-65% of the 1 repetition maximum, seeking&#xD;
      to avoid excessive muscle damage and inflammation) and using machines, dumbbells, weight bars&#xD;
      and plates, elastic straps and wearable weights.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This type of strength training has shown to be effective for releasing anabolic myokines&#xD;
      (IL-4, IL-13, IL-15, leukaemia inhibitory factor) and have great therapeutic potential&#xD;
      against osteoporosis and sarcopenia/cachexia (responsible for around 20% of cancer-related&#xD;
      deaths) associated with metastatic cancer and associated treatments (39,42), as well as&#xD;
      resulting in only mild muscle damage and inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures These measurements are made by an interviewer blind to group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measure (baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiorespiratory functional capacity, as assessed using a 400-m walk test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in health-related quality of life, as assessed using the 36-item Short-Form&#xD;
           Health Survey (SF-36) and disease-specific questionnaires: the European Organization for&#xD;
           the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) in&#xD;
           patients with cancer; and the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) and Chronic Respiratory Disease&#xD;
           Questionnaire (CRQ) in patients with COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures (baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Muscle strength test measured by the handgrip strength and sit-and-stand tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thresholds for lactate (LT) and anaerobic threshold or maximal lactate steady state&#xD;
           (MLSS), HR, and accelerometer activity counts for tailoring the exercises, determined in&#xD;
           submaximal walking or running tests. For detecting the LT, a test will be carried out on&#xD;
           a 20-metre track. This will be an incremental test combining 2-minute active period and&#xD;
           1-minute rest period. To help the participant adjust their speed in each 2-minute&#xD;
           period, red markers will be placed every 5 metres on the floor and on the wall on both&#xD;
           sides and two large cones on the floor at each end of the track. Participants will be&#xD;
           asked to reach the next red markers each time they hear a beep, continually adjusting&#xD;
           their speed but without stopping; that is, they should go faster or more slowly seeking&#xD;
           to pass each set of markers at the time of the corresponding beep. The speed will start&#xD;
           at 2.4 km/h in the first stage; and will increase by 0.61 km/h each stage (42). At the&#xD;
           end of each stage, the following will be recorded: HR, Rating of Perceived Exertion and&#xD;
           lactate concentration, by taking a blood sample from each earlobe to find the minimum&#xD;
           lactate equivalent (LEmin) above which the lactate concentration starts to increase&#xD;
           exponentially. Hence, the aerobic threshold is defined as the intensity of exercise&#xD;
           (speed) at which the lowest recorded lactate level is followed by changes ≥ 0.1 mmol/L&#xD;
           in the next stage and &gt;0.2 mmol/L the one after (25). The test will be stopped if the&#xD;
           participant becomes exhausted or lactate levels exceed 3 mmol/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify MLSS, another test will be performed a week after the incremental lactate test to&#xD;
      identify the corresponding LT. Based on certain parameters from this progressive test,&#xD;
      detailed below, it has been shown to be possible to estimate the speed at which an individual&#xD;
      reaches the MLSS accurately (estimates accounting for 86% of the variance in MLSS with&#xD;
      standard error of the estimate of 0.385 km/h and the difference between the estimated value&#xD;
      of MLSS and the true value lying between -0.77 and 0.81 km/h 95% of the time) (25).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For assessing the MLSS, the patient should return to the health centre where the measurements&#xD;
      are taken 1 week later. The infrastructure required is the same as for the incremental&#xD;
      lactate test; all that changes is the protocol. An audio recording will be made with two&#xD;
      blocks of 10 minutes separated by a 2-minute recovery period, at an MLSS speed estimated&#xD;
      using the results obtained in the incremental lactate test and the following equation: MLSS =&#xD;
      3.408 + (1.094·LEmin+1 mM) - (0.036·age - (0.013· LEmin HR)) (25)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical activity performed. For this, each participant will be fitted with an Actigraph&#xD;
           wGT3X-BT accelerometer on their right hip at the level of the iliac crest and a HR&#xD;
           monitor band (Polar OH1). They should wear these monitors for a week and complete a&#xD;
           daily record of their activity, to monitor activity counts during different intensities&#xD;
           of activity. To analyse these data, we will assess the activity counts which correlated&#xD;
           with the LT during the incremental test and thereby be able to assess their weekly&#xD;
           physical activity based on personal activity count thresholds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body composition (OMROM body fat percentage), body mass index and abdominal&#xD;
           circumference, estimated cardiovascular risk and the onset of any cardiovascular events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychological changes assessed using Goldberg's 12-item General Health Questionnaire&#xD;
           (GHQ-12) and Duke Social Support Index&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In addition, in the case of schizophrenia, changes in mental state assessed using the&#xD;
           Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and the severity of the patient's&#xD;
           condition and changes therein during the course of the programme assessed using the&#xD;
           Clinical Global Impression (CGI) and the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lipid profile, as well as levels of C-reactive protein, glucose, insulin and specific&#xD;
           exercise-related parameters: adiponectin, BDNF in participants with schizophrenia, TNF-α&#xD;
           in those with cancer and Il-1 and Il-6 in those who have COPD or are transplant&#xD;
           recipients (at baseline and 3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Potential predictive, modifying and confounding factors: sex, age, comorbidities&#xD;
           (Adjusted Clinical Groups Case-Mix System), risk factors, socioeconomic status, drug&#xD;
           treatments and characteristics of each chronic condition.&#xD;
