  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of people living with dementia is increasing as the population ages. The UK&#xD;
      government has initiated a &quot;Dementia strategy&quot; to respond to this increase, and has set four&#xD;
      main goalsÍ¾ 1) to identify those with dementia as early as possible, 2) to prolong their&#xD;
      independence, 3) to reduce the need for hospital and nursing home admissions, and 4) to delay&#xD;
      the time until death. So far lots of research has looked at what factors might cause or&#xD;
      increase the risk of dementia, but less is known about how dementia affects people over time&#xD;
      once they have dementia. One of the quickest and efficient ways to identify the actual course&#xD;
      of dementia may be to use existing medical records from primary care. Primary care medical&#xD;
      records are those kept by the patient's GP. Having the ability to look at the course of&#xD;
      dementia over time in these records will help identify people who have a different course&#xD;
      (for example a faster and more severe course) and also identify the factors that alter that&#xD;
      course. This information would be useful to clinicians and indicate potential targets for&#xD;
      treatment in the future to alter the course of someone's disease. To assess whether this is&#xD;
      possible, around 1000 patients with dementia who have recently been seen by a dementia&#xD;
      service (where patients with a diagnosis of dementia are seen normally every year) will be&#xD;
      contacted. Consent to link their primary care medical records (medical records kept by their&#xD;
      GP) to their dementia service medical records will be sought. The target for recruitment is&#xD;
      400 patients who will provide consent. Then the assessment of how well the potential markers&#xD;
      of disease progression identified from primary care medical records relate to actual changes&#xD;
      in disease course from their dementia service medical records can be determined.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The UK government has prioritised early recognition and treatment of dementia, with specific&#xD;
      goals to prolong independence, delay nursing home and hospital admissions, and reduce&#xD;
      mortality. It is recognised that this strategy in the UK health system necessitates primary&#xD;
      care involvement in diagnosis and management of dementia. While advances have been made in&#xD;
      identifying patients with dementia within primary care, there is little research on the&#xD;
      course of the disease after diagnosis, even though information about disease course and the&#xD;
      factors that alter the course are essential to patient management and wider health policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One potential major resource for studying these issues in primary care are Electronic Health&#xD;
      Record (EHR) databases which contain routinely recorded information from consultations with a&#xD;
      GP and other healthcare professional such as illnesses and treatment provided. They are a&#xD;
      useful resource for studying how illnesses progress after diagnosis in primary care and have&#xD;
      been used to investigate disease course, outcomes and patient care in a wide spectrum of&#xD;
      diseases. However, to date, they have not been used to research the course of dementia after&#xD;
      diagnosis. Existing evidence has established important dementia outcomes (e.g. nursing home&#xD;
      placement, hospital admissions, mortality) are recorded within EHR and a systematic review&#xD;
      that has recently been performed suggests other illnesses and symptoms (e.g. cognitive&#xD;
      status, neuropsychiatric symptoms), may be recorded within primary care EHR and could serve&#xD;
      as markers of disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this research gap the research will identify possible markers of disease&#xD;
      progression from routinely collected in primary care medical records and compare them against&#xD;
      assessments of disease progression from specialist dementia service medical records. The&#xD;
      study will enable healthcare professionals to use routinely recorded information in primary&#xD;
      care, without the need for intensive assessments, to identify individuals with dementia who&#xD;
      are at risk of a faster disease progression. This will drive the future development and&#xD;
      delivery of treatment to the individual patient with dementia based on their likely future&#xD;
      course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CoMed study is a retrospective cohort design linking dementia service and primary care&#xD;
      medical records. Potential participants' only involvement will be a request for consent to&#xD;
      access and link these medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from a secondary care dementia service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who have a confirmed diagnosis of dementia in the dementia service medical&#xD;
      records and who have been assessed by the dementia service at more than one-time point at&#xD;
      least 12 months apart will be identified (a 12-month gap is the minimum necessary to&#xD;
      determine disease progression). The first 1000 eligible patients will be initially identified&#xD;
      (expected number required to obtain sample size required of 400 patients), however, further&#xD;
      searches can be carried out if the expected response and recruitment rate is not met. The&#xD;
      list of patients to be invited will be screened by the patient's clinical care team in the&#xD;
      participating dementia service to exclude those who it would be inappropriate to contact as&#xD;
      it may cause undue distress or harm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients who have been seen by the dementia service within the previous 12 months&#xD;
      will be identified by the dementia service clinical care team. These eligible patients will&#xD;
      be sent by post the study information pack containing: an invitation letter, patient and&#xD;
      personal consultee information leaflets, patient consent and personal consultee declaration&#xD;
      forms, and a stamped addressed return envelope. If there is no reply to the initial&#xD;
      invitation, then a reminder invitation and study information pack will be sent after a&#xD;
      minimum of 2 weeks. A poster about the study will be displayed in the dementia service&#xD;
      clinical areas and waiting areas, and a copy of the poster in leaflet form will be available&#xD;
      for patients to take away and read if they wish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A review of the response and recruitment rate will be undertaken at regular intervals to&#xD;
      assess whether more patients need to be identified (based on a 40% recruitment rate). If the&#xD;
      required number of patients is not achieved additional recruitment strategy will be&#xD;
      initiated. An additional search of the dementia service medical records to identify further&#xD;
      eligible patients and study packs will be posted out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those who are willing to take part in the study written informed consent will be obtained&#xD;
      from patients with dementia (or personal consultee's advice for those not able to give&#xD;
      consent) to access their dementia service medical records and their primary care medical&#xD;
      records and for these to be linked and used for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In those consenting to take part in the study, patient data will be retrieved from the&#xD;
      dementia service records including detailed clinical assessments of cognitive status,&#xD;
      behavioural and function assessments, and the time points of these assessments. The patient's&#xD;
      primary care medical records will be requested from their GP practice. Details on how to&#xD;
      electronically download the requested medical records and securely transfer them via the&#xD;
      secure NHS email system will be included with the letter to GP practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality and anonymity will be maintained for all participants. All information&#xD;
      collected regarding participants will be kept confidential. Participants will be free to&#xD;
      withdraw from the study and to request their medical records are not used up to a period of&#xD;
      one month from the date consent is given. After this point, pseudoanonymised data will be&#xD;
      used and it will not be possible to identify patients to remove their medical records from&#xD;
      the analysis dataset. The presence or absence of potential markers of progression recorded in&#xD;
      patients' primary care records will then be compared to change in scores from standard clinic&#xD;
      assessments recorded at the specialist dementia clinic.&#xD;
