      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the response of toripalimab (JS001), a PD1 antibody,&#xD;
      in participants with POLE or POLD-mutated and non microsatellite instability (non-MSI-H)&#xD;
      advanced solid cancers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy including antibodies targeting PD-1/PD-L1 or CTLA-4&#xD;
      has greatly advanced the cancer treatments. Recent studies have identified several predictive&#xD;
      markers for ICI which includes microsatellite instability (MSI), PD-L1 expression and tumor&#xD;
      mutation burden (TMB). DNA polymerase epsilon (POLE) and delta (POLD) are in charge of DNA&#xD;
      replication as well as proofreading during DNA replication. Their germline or somatic&#xD;
      mutations can lead to DNA repair deficiencies and carcinogenesis. The investigators has found&#xD;
      that the POLE or POLD mutation causes an increased TMB in cancer patients and may lead to a&#xD;
      better survival to ICI. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      toripalimab , a PD1 antibody, in participants with POLE or POLD-mutated and non&#xD;
      microsatellite instability high (non-MSI-H) advanced solid cancers. This is a Phase II, open&#xD;
      label, single arm study. Participants enrolled in this study received toripalimab 240mg,&#xD;
      every 3 weeks until disease progress or intolerable toxicity. Primary endpoints is ORR and&#xD;
      secondary endpoints are OS, PFS and safety.&#xD;
