  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial to access oral Methenamine&#xD;
      Hippurate (MH) in combination with cranberry capsules is superior to cranberry capsules alone&#xD;
      in prevention of UTI in patients with transient post-operative urinary retention requiring a&#xD;
      Foley catheter after pelvic reconstructive surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common bacterial infections in women. It&#xD;
      is estimated that 1.6 billion dollars are spent on UTI treatment each year. Antibiotics have&#xD;
      been the mainstay of treatment of UTIs, however frequent use has increased the prevalence of&#xD;
      antibiotic resistant organisms. Therefore, focus has shifted to non-antibiotic therapy for&#xD;
      UTI prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methenamine Hippurate (MH) has been studied for decades due to its potential role in&#xD;
      prevention of UTI. While not technically an antibiotic, MH works via its bacteriostatic&#xD;
      action in the bladder. Benefits of MH are the lack of development of resistance, and the&#xD;
      selective nature of this drug to the urinary system only. However, MH is best used in&#xD;
      conjunction with an acidifying agent to increase its bioavailability (such as cranberry&#xD;
      capsules or other acidic products). The usage of MH has been studied in various populations,&#xD;
      has been seen to be effective in short-term catheterization. Usage of cranberry as&#xD;
      prophylaxis for UTI is controversial; however, results have been favorable in the&#xD;
      post-operative gynecological population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative urinary retention (POUR) occurs frequently in patients who undergo&#xD;
      incontinence and pelvic prolapse surgery. Although the definition of POUR can vary between&#xD;
      clinicians, it is reported as 2.5-24% to as high as 43% after tension-free transvaginal mesh&#xD;
      sling placement. This population is at also at high risk for UTI due to advanced age and&#xD;
      menopausal status. Moreover, using a catheter longer than 2 days incurs a 2-fold increased&#xD;
      risk of development of UTI with an estimated 5% increase in bacteriuria each day of&#xD;
      catheterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In hopes to decrease the overuse of antibiotics and decrease the likelihood of antibiotic&#xD;
      resistance, we propose that the use of MH and cranberry can reflect a potential benefit in&#xD;
      this population of short-term indwelling Foley catheter use and help reduce the incidence of&#xD;
      post-operative UTI after pelvic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will then be randomized to either receive cranberry capsules and placebo OR&#xD;
      cranberry capsules and Methenamine Hippurate.&#xD;
