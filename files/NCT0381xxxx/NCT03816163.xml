  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to confirm the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of zolbetuximab&#xD;
      in combination with Nab-P + GEM, determine overall survival and assess the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of the combination treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also evaluate tumor markers and pharmacokinetics (PK) of zolbetuximab, Nab-P&#xD;
      and GEM, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL).&#xD;

Each domain comprises 5 severity levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, extreme problems). The general visual analog scale records the respondent's self-rated health status on a vertical graduated (0 = the worst health a participant can imagine to 100 = the best health a participant can imagine) visual analogue scale. Responses to the 5 items will also be converted to a weighted health state index (utility score) based on values derived from general population samples.</description>
