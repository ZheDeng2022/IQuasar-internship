    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Natalizumab in&#xD;
      children, adolescent and young adult patients with pulmonary metastatic osteosarcoma (pOS)&#xD;
      and to assess clinical response associated with this treatment as well as overall survival.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-arm, open-label, proof of concept clinical trial in children,&#xD;
      adolescent and young adult patients with unresectable pOS that have progressed, relapsed or&#xD;
      are refractory to standard systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive the study therapy and there will be dose escalation in a&#xD;
      traditional 3 + 3 design during the Phase I study of this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Phase II study of the trial, treatment will continue if the subject has Complete&#xD;
      Response (CR), Partial Response (PR) or Stable Disease (SD) of pOS after every 3 cycles after&#xD;
      the first 6 cycles but not beyond 24 cycles, unless it is judged to be in his/her best&#xD;
      interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 3-9 subjects will be enrolled in the phase I part and 10-12 in the phase II&#xD;
      part of this trial. Participants will be followed for toxicity for 30 days after treatment&#xD;
      has been discontinued or until one of the protocol-defined reasons&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to evaluate if Natalizumab can be used safely and effectively as&#xD;
      immunotherapy in children, adolescent and young adult patients with pOS. Natalizumab is&#xD;
      currently Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for the treatment of T-cell mediated&#xD;
      autoimmune disorders The study team will evaluate the safety and tolerability of Natalizumab&#xD;
      as well as the clinical response associated with Natalizumab treatment and evaluate overall&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;

    <description>Natalizumab is an FDA approved monotherapy for treatment of relapsing forms of MS. It is also indicated for inducing and maintaining clinical response and remission in adult patients with moderately to severely active CD who have had an inadequate response to, or intolerance of, conventional therapies and TNF-α inhibitors.&#xD;
Traditional 3+3 escalation of Natalizumab at a weight-based dosing 2mg/kg not to exceed 300mg. If no subjects experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT), 3 more subjects are enrolled at the next dose of 3mg/kg, not to exceed 300mg. If no subjects experience a DLT, 3 more subjects will be enrolled at the next and final dose of 4mg/kg, not to exceed 300mg.&#xD;
Phase II will continue if the subject has Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR) or Stable Disease (SD) of pOS, defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria after every 3 cycles after the first 6 cycles but not beyond 24 cycles. If subject has progressive disease after cycle 6, they will be removed from the study.</description>

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing prior treatment toxicities &gt; Grade 1 according to NCI CTCAE Version 5.0 with&#xD;
             the exception of alopecia, anorexia, bone pain and tumor pain.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;

             would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because Natalizumab&#xD;
             crosses the placenta and can increase the risk of spontaneous abortion. There is an&#xD;
             unknown, but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with Natalizumab, therefore breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with Natalizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception prior&#xD;
             to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become&#xD;
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should&#xD;
             inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive subjects and HIV-positive subjects on antiretroviral therapy are&#xD;
             ineligible because of the risk for developing a lethal infection when treated with&#xD;
             immunosuppressive therapy.&#xD;
