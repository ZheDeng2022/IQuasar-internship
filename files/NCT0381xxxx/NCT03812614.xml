  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of a novel program-Family&#xD;
      Partners for Health Action (FAM-ACT) - to individual patient-focused diabetes self-management&#xD;
      education and care management(I-DSME/CM).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      FAM-ACT uses three innovative approaches to enhance the impact of family support on diabetes&#xD;
      management:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Provide Support Person with core behavioral strategies, hands-on training, and tools&#xD;
           directed at specific roles in supporting diabetes management (e.g. how to support action&#xD;
           planning and medication adherence).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Teach Support Person how to deliver support in ways that will empower patients and not&#xD;
           sabotage support efforts (e.g. empathetic and autonomy-supportive communication).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Teach Support Person ways to boost patient engagement in healthcare (e.g. how to support&#xD;
           healthcare visit preparation and participatory communication with providers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHWs will deliver FAM-ACT through Support Person-focused group DSME sessions plus Support&#xD;
      Person-focused care management sessions to Patient-Support Person dyads at an urban federally&#xD;
      qualified health center. When situationally appropriate, the care management sessions will be&#xD;
      conducted by phone/video call or using a HIPAA-compliant online video-conferencing platform.&#xD;
      268 patients with type 2 diabetes and either poor glycemic or blood pressure control will be&#xD;
      randomized together with a member or friend (known as a Support Person) to receive either&#xD;
      FAM-ACT or more traditional CHW-led patient-focused DSME/CM over 12 months.&#xD;

    <description>The Patient Activation Measure (PAM) scale measures an individual's self-management ability. It shows how ready, willing and able an individual is to manage his or her health and healthcare.&#xD;
After the PAM is completed, an individual will fall into 1 of 4 levels of activation along a 100- point, empirically-derived scale: 'Low' (Levels 1 &amp; 2), 'Moderate' (Level 3), and 'High' (Level 4). Typically, levels 1 and 2 are more similar, with Level 3 being a clear bridge to the highest activation, Level 4.</description>
