  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an ancillary study to the UPLIFT trial (NCT03074643) to evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      diet composition (i.e., amount of protein and carbohydrate) during a 6-month weight loss&#xD;
      intervention and 12-months of follow-up on bone phenotypes in obese older adults.&#xD;
      Participants will receive either a protein or carbohydrate supplement along with a behavioral&#xD;
      weight loss intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ancillary study to the UPLIFT trial (NCT03074643) will use a 3-group design in 225 obese&#xD;
      (BMI 30-45 kg/m2 or 27-&lt;30 kg/m2 with an obesity-related risk factor), older (65-85 years)&#xD;
      men and women at risk for disability (SPPB ≤10) who will undergo a 6-month weight loss&#xD;
      intervention followed by a 12-month follow-up phase to test the overall hypothesis that a&#xD;
      higher protein (1.2 g/kg body wt/d) / lower carbohydrate (CHO) diet during a 6-month weight&#xD;
      loss intervention improves bone phenotypes compared with an isocaloric lower protein (the&#xD;
      current Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), 0.8 g/kg body wt/d) / higher CHO diet, and&#xD;
      whether continuing a higher protein / lower CHO diet for 12-months following weight loss will&#xD;
      result in better maintenance of bone. All participants will undergo a 6-month weight loss&#xD;
      intervention involving caloric restriction and supervised exercise followed by 12 months of&#xD;
      follow-up with randomization to one of three groups (n=75/group): 1) Lower protein / higher&#xD;
      CHO diet for the 6-month weight loss phase only (RecProt); 2) Higher protein / lower CHO diet&#xD;
      for the 6-month weight loss phase only (6-mo HiProt); or 3) Higher protein / lower CHO diet&#xD;
      for the 6-month weight loss and 12-month follow-up phases (18-mo HiProt). Vertebral and&#xD;
      femoral volumetric bone mineral density and cortical thickness (Primary Aim) and bone marrow&#xD;
      adipose tissue (Secondary Aim 1) will be assessed with computed tomography at baseline, 6-,&#xD;
      and 18-months. Bone strength and fracture risk (Secondary Aim 2) will be assessed by finite&#xD;
      element modeling at baseline, 6-, and 18-months.&#xD;

    <description>All participants will undergo a dietary weight loss intervention designed to elicit behavioral changes leading to decreased caloric intake sufficient to yield a ~10% loss of initial body mass. The weight loss intervention will incorporate nutrition education (via group and individual meetings with the study dietitian), self-monitoring skills, cognitive-behavioral strategies for promoting lifestyle behavior modifications, and planned meals. Behavioral and educational group and individual sessions will be held weekly in a 3:1 ratio (3 group and 1 individual session per month).</description>
