      Impact of marketing of alcohol products on young people&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Responsible for 3.3 million deaths worldwide, alcohol consumption causes diseases (liver&#xD;
      cirrhosis, cancers, etc.) and social problems (injuries, road accidents, alcohol dependence,&#xD;
      etc.). With one of the highest consumption rate in Europe, alcohol is the second cause of&#xD;
      avoidable mortality in France after tobacco (49.000 alcohol attributable deaths in 2009) and&#xD;
      its social cost is estimated to 120 billion euros. French teenage population is particularly&#xD;
      associated with heavy drinking patterns: in 2014, 49% of 17-year olds declared heavy episodic&#xD;
      drinking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In that regard, several measures are recommended by health actors to combat this issue:&#xD;
      minimum unit pricing, sales ban to minor, low blood alcohol concentration for drivers, etc. A&#xD;
      specific measure concerns alcohol advertising restrictions. Some countries implemented&#xD;
      alcohol advertising regulation laws (Poland, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, etc.), including&#xD;
      France with the Evin law passed in 1991. This French law mandates advertising (and packaging)&#xD;
      content to strictly convey factual information and objective qualities of alcohol products&#xD;
      and thus bans attractive ads based on image and lifestyle evocations (seduction, power,&#xD;
      etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this research is to investigate whether statutory framework for alcohol&#xD;
      advertising (e.g., Evin law) can effectively protect people against misleading, suggestive,&#xD;
      and appealing content. Little research has been conducted on this topic in spite of WHO's&#xD;
      recommendations (most research has explored the influence of exposure to ads but not the&#xD;
      impact of content).&#xD;
