  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who progress slowly after Epidermal&#xD;
      Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors（EGFR-TKI）resistance. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to investigate the efficacy and drug resistance mechanism of Apatinib combine with&#xD;
      EGFR-TK1 treated for advanced slow progressed non-small cell lung cancer and provide new&#xD;
      treatment options.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidermal growth factor receptor Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR TKI) have been approved to&#xD;
      treat NSCLC harboring EGFR mutation as first-line therapy. However, a large proportion of&#xD;
      patients would become acquired resistant of EGFR-TKI after about one year although initially&#xD;
      sensitivity. Previous studies demonstrated that the anti-angiogenesis combined with EGFR-TKI&#xD;
      in slow-progressed EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer achieved good efficacy&#xD;
      and disease control rates, prolonged the progression free survival. The present study is aim&#xD;
      to expand the number of samples to monitor resistance-related genes and tumor cells.&#xD;
      Furthermore, to investigate the mechanism of anti-angiogenesis combine with EGFR-TKI and&#xD;
      provide the theory for the use and promotion of clinically protocols. In this study, the&#xD;
      primary objective is the objective response rates and the secondary goal are disease control&#xD;
      rates, overall survival, progression free survival and drug safety.&#xD;
