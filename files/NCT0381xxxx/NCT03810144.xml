      Nine months multi-center prospective, randomized observational study, two arm trial to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of MBDA score-guided care on disease activity and medical costs. To&#xD;
      investigate whether treatment decisions guided by MBDA scores result in reduced disease&#xD;
      activity and overall medical cost among patients with RA relative to usual care (UC).&#xD;

    <description>For patients in the guided care arm, treating physicians will receive the Vectra DA MBDA Test score prior to the patient visit and will have a set of guidance for decision-making based on these scores. Treating physicians will be strongly encouraged to follow the guidance but will not be required to do so. For test results to be available at the time of each visit in the MBDA guided treatment arm, blood testing will be performed 7-10 days before the visit.</description>
