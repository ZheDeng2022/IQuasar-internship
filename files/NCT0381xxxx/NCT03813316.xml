  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is a serious public health challenge which affects more than&#xD;
      9% of Canadians older than 20 years, an estimated prevalence that is anticipated to increase&#xD;
      by over 40% in the next decade. The microvascular and macrovascular complications of T2D&#xD;
      markedly increase the risks of hospitalization, heart disease, amputation, blindness, end&#xD;
      stage renal disease and death, with profound socio-economic consequences for patients,&#xD;
      families and society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optimal glycemic control is fundamental to the management of T2D, as glycated hemoglobin&#xD;
      (A1C) levels &gt; 7.0% are associated with a significantly increased risk of both microvascular&#xD;
      and cardiovascular complications. But despite detailed clinical practice guidelines for&#xD;
      management of hyperglycemia, glycemic control remains sub-optimal in a large proportion of&#xD;
      patients. For example, in over 5000 Canadian diabetic patients managed by primary care&#xD;
      physicians (PCPs), more than 50% had an A1C &gt; 7% and more than 20% an A1C &gt; 8%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients not achieving glycemic target on metformin monotherapy and without clinical CVD,&#xD;
      Diabetes Canada 2018 Guidelines suggest that the preferred oral antihyperglycemic agents as&#xD;
      add-on therapy be either DPP-4 inhibitors or SGLT2 inhibitors if avoidance of hypoglycemia&#xD;
      and/or weight gain is a priority. Since most patients with type 2 diabetes would benefit from&#xD;
      avoidance of hypoglycemia and/or weight gain, there is clinical rationale for adding DPP-4&#xD;
      inhibitors or SGLT2 inhibitors as oral therapy before considering other oral agents like&#xD;
      sulfonylureas or thiazolidinediones. This study is designed to explore the possibility of&#xD;
      improving care by providing more precise management guidance to primary care physicians when&#xD;
      utilizing DPP-4 inhibitors or SGLT2 inhibitors as add-on therapy to metformin.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This cluster-based study will be conducted in a Primary Care clinical practice setting in&#xD;
      Canada. A total of approximately 60 physician practices will be stratified into single (1&#xD;
      PCP) or group (&gt;1 PCP) practices and randomized 1:1 into two arms each consisting of&#xD;
      approximately 30 Primary Care practices forming the Interventional arm and the Control arm.&#xD;
      The study population will include approximately 600 male and female adult participants living&#xD;
      in Canada; who have been diagnosed with T2D; who are being treated for this condition by&#xD;
      their PCP; who do not have clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) and whose eGFR is ≥&#xD;
      60ml/min; who are receiving metformin at a dose of ≥1500 mg/day as monotherapy for T2D; who&#xD;
      are not at the target for glycemic control and whose most recent A1C level is between 7.1 %&#xD;
      and 9.0 %. Participant enrollment may be adjusted to ensure balanced distribution of glycemic&#xD;
      values at entry across this range between study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All physicians in both arms will receive training on the most current Diabetes Canada 2018&#xD;
      Guidelines for pharmacologic management of type 2 diabetes and the role of DPP-4 inhibitors&#xD;
      or SGLT2 inhibitors as add-on therapy to metformin. Physicians in the Interventional arm will&#xD;
      receive additional training on specific individualized management for adding DPP-4 inhibitors&#xD;
      or SGLT2 inhibitors to metformin. The nature of the additional training will be described&#xD;
      separately in a physician training manual. To avoid contamination, only physicians who have&#xD;
      been randomized to the Interventional arm will be given access to the physician training&#xD;
      manual during the operation of the study, while those physicians randomized into the Control&#xD;
      arm will continue to follow their routine clinical practice for utilizing DPP-4 inhibitors or&#xD;
      SGLT2 inhibitors as add-on to metformin according to the current Diabetes Canada Practice&#xD;
      Guidelines.&#xD;
