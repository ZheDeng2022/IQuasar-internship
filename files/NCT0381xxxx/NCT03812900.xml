    <textblock>
      This is a comparative, conceptual, randomized clinical study to investigate newly developed&#xD;
      over basic Echinacea formulations for the treatment of acute symptoms of respiratory tract&#xD;
      infections. 400 adults will be recruited, of which approximately 300 will develop a common&#xD;
      cold or a influenza-like infection. Two newly developed and two existing Echinacea&#xD;
      formulations (solid/liquid) will be randomly dispensed at inclusion for treatment of maximal&#xD;
      3 infections. Treatment starts at first signs of infection and lasts for a maximum of 10 days&#xD;
      or until symptom resolution. Nasopharynx samples will be collected for analysis of common&#xD;
      viral respiratory agents throughout treatment. Safety and efficacy variables will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The monocentre trial compares two newly developed pharmaceutical forms of Echinacea (extract&#xD;
      from Echinacea purpurea Herba and Radix; lozenges or spray) with two basic and authorised&#xD;
      pharmaceutical forms (tablets or drops; comparator groups) for the treatment of acute&#xD;
      symptoms of the common cold and/or influenza-like illness (ILI) in adults. Trial subjects are&#xD;
      preventatively screened and included in the study (n = 400). If they show acute symptoms of a&#xD;
      common cold or ILI during the study period, they are instructed to call the study centre to&#xD;
      have confirmed the indication for treatment and begin with the treatment, they are randomized&#xD;
      to (1:1:1:1 randomization into one of four groups). The primary endpoint is the time until&#xD;
      remission of respiratory symptoms with the new pharmaceutical forms compared to the basic&#xD;
      forms during the first episode. Secondary endpoints include remission of all treated episodes&#xD;
      (max. 3 episodes), remission times comparison between different pharmaceutical forms (e.g.&#xD;
      lozenges vs. spray, lozenges vs. drops etc), reduction of viral load on day 5 and 9 compared&#xD;
      to day 1 of treatment (nasopharyngeal swabs), differences in safety (blood parameters before&#xD;
      and during treatment), differences in number of adverse events, tolerance and efficacy&#xD;
      assessed by the patients.&#xD;
