  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whipples resection is an operation that has a burden of high morbidity and mortality. It is&#xD;
      performed for a variety of disorders of the pancreas, duodenum and ampulla. The most common&#xD;
      indication is pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma which has a poor long term outcome even when&#xD;
      curative surgery has been performed. Short and long term outcomes however, have improved&#xD;
      recently and the indications for curative resection have been increasingly extended,&#xD;
      including operating on those that previously may have been considered too old to benefit from&#xD;
      curative resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little is known about the benefit of performing this procedure in the oldest patients.&#xD;
      Performing Whipples resection in patients over the age of 70 has been reported and has been&#xD;
      shown to result in satisfactory perioperative results with comparable long term outcomes to&#xD;
      those under 70. However the benefit of performing the same procedure in the over 80 age group&#xD;
      is less well reported and consistently presents a challenging decision for the clinician.&#xD;

      Whipples resection is an operation that has a burden of high morbidity and mortality. It is&#xD;
      performed for a variety of disorders of the pancreas, duodenum and ampulla. The most common&#xD;
      indication is pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma which has a poor long term outcome even when&#xD;
      curative surgery has been performed. Short and long term outcomes however, have improved&#xD;
      recently and the indications for curative resection have been increasingly extended,&#xD;
      including operating on those that previously may have been considered too old to benefit from&#xD;
      curative resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little is known about the benefit of performing this procedure in the oldest patients.&#xD;
      Performing Whipples resection in patients over the age of 70 has been reported and has been&#xD;
      shown to result in satisfactory perioperative results with comparable long term outcomes to&#xD;
      those under 70. However the benefit of performing the same procedure in the over 80 age group&#xD;
      is less well reported and consistently presents a challenging decision for the clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study therefore aims to assess the short and long term outcomes of patients undergoing&#xD;
      Whipples PD in the over 80 age group in Lothian. This will be combined with data from all the&#xD;
      other units in Scotland that perform Whipples resection (Dundee, Glasgow and Aberdeen)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be overall and disease free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be identified by using procedure specific codes to identify those patients&#xD;
      who underwent Whipples pancreaticoduodenectomy from the ORSOS prospectively collated theatre&#xD;
      record database. The other centres in Scotland will identify their subjects via their own&#xD;
      methodology.&#xD;
