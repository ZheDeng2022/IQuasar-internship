  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to compare contrast-enhanced ultrasound guided liver biopsy&#xD;
      (CEUS-LB) with conventional ultrasound guided liver biopsy (US-LB) in the diagnosis of liver&#xD;
      tumors developed on a background of advanced chronic liver diseases. All patients referred to&#xD;
      our department with a CT/MRI diagnosis of hepatic neoplasia will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      either CEUS-LB or US-LB. All LB will be performed by the same investigator. For the&#xD;
      randomisation the flip coin technique will be used. One investigator without access to&#xD;
      previous C/MRI/US report will do the randomization&#xD;

      A prospective parallel group clinical trial will be performed. The study protocol was&#xD;
      implemented in our Institute starting January 2011 ending January 1 2020. During this period,&#xD;
      all patients with a suspicion of primary liver neoplasia either on CT or MRI will be&#xD;
      evaluated in different departments from our Institute for possible inclusion. Patients with a&#xD;
      typical aspect of benign FLLs will not be included in the study. Patients fulfilling the&#xD;
      following criteria: presence of cirrhosis or other chronic liver disease (according to a&#xD;
      liver stiffness evaluated by transient elastography higher than 10 kilopascals), Child-Pugh&#xD;
      score no higher than B7 and absence of perihepatic ascites, platelet count &gt; 50.000 per mm3&#xD;
      or an international normalized ratio &lt; 1.6; will be further on sent to the department of&#xD;
      interventional ultrasound. ). All patients referred to interventional department will&#xD;
      underwent a B-mode ultrasound (1 investigator) testing the feasibility of performing liver&#xD;
      biopsy. At this time point the conspicuity of the tumors will be recorded into either poorly&#xD;
      or not poorly visible. Included patients will be randomly divided by another investigator&#xD;
      (T.M.) without access to the previous US, CT or MRI report into two groups: a group that will&#xD;
      underwent US guided liver biopsy (USLB) and another one who will underwent CEUS guided liver&#xD;
      biopsy (CEUSLB). The randomization will be made based of flip coin technique. The side of the&#xD;
      coin (heads-USLB, tails CEUSLB) determined the assignment of each subject. All biopsies will&#xD;
      be performed by the same investigator (Z.S.) with an experience of more than 8 years in&#xD;
      ultrasound interventions. Patients assigned to USLB or CEUSLB will be blinded. The&#xD;
      investigators assessing the outcomes will not be informed about the LB technique used in each&#xD;
      patient. The reasons for performing biopsy will be either inconclusive CT/MRI findings , or&#xD;
      patients with a typical pattern of HCC on CT/MRI in whom a histological diagnosis is&#xD;
      necessary in order to start systemic therapy (sorafenib). Different from other major&#xD;
      society's guidelines, in our country a histological diagnosis of HCC is mandatory in patients&#xD;
      referred for sorafenib treatment. Patients with small FLLs (BCLC 0 or A) and typical aspect&#xD;
      of HCC on CT/MRI will be sent directly to surgery or radiofrequency ablation according to&#xD;
      EASL guidelines.&#xD;
