  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study. This research study is being conducted to find new ways to treat&#xD;
      severe hemophilia A. This study is a gene therapy study. Gene therapy is an experimental way&#xD;
      to introduce, into a person's cells, specific genetic material. A gene can be&#xD;
      delivered/introduced into a cell using a carrier known as a &quot;vector.&quot; In this study, a virus&#xD;
      (lentivirus), the &quot;vector&quot;, is used to introduce or deliver a gene that creates and stores a&#xD;
      protein Factor VIII (FVIII) in your platelets. These platelets are made from stem cells&#xD;
      (mother cells for your bone marrow) that are removed from your blood by a procedure called&#xD;
      apheresis. This research study will take some of the patient's own stem cells, from the&#xD;
      apheresis procedure, and genetically modify them using the vector in order to make them&#xD;
      produce FVIII in platelets that arise from the stem cells. They will then give the&#xD;
      genetically modified stem cells back to the patient so that they can possibly create&#xD;
      platelets that produce and store Factor VIII on their own.&#xD;

      This is an open label, nonrandomized, single center, phase I cohort study, involving reduced&#xD;
      intensity conditioning, followed by a single infusion of autologous CD34+PBSC, transduced&#xD;
      with a lentiviral vector (-889ITGA2B-BDDFVIII-WPTS (MUT6)(VSVg)) also known as&#xD;
      (Pleightlet(MUT6)) encoding the B domain deleted from of human coagulation factor VIII&#xD;
      (BDDFVIII) in up to five hemophilia A patients with a history of FVIII inhibitors (≥0.6BU) .&#xD;
