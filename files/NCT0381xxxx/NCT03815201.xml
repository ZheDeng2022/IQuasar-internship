  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia is a geriatric syndrome associated with functional lost and disability, leading to&#xD;
      an increase in healthcare costs. Physical activity, especially multicomponent exercise&#xD;
      program, seems to be the most effective intervention to delay disability in elderly patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the current study is to determine if leucine-enriched protein ingestion&#xD;
      after exercise training helps to increase muscle mass gains. Secondary outcomes will be to&#xD;
      analyse the different effects among cognitive performance, depressive symptoms, disability,&#xD;
      inflammation, quality of life and use of healthcare services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled trial will be carried out to assess the objectives of the current&#xD;
      study. Participants will be randomized into two different groups (N=40, each one): an&#xD;
      exercise training control group and exercise training plus leucine-enriched protein ingestion&#xD;
      intervention group. Exercise training will take 12 weeks of supervised training intervention&#xD;
      and 12 weeks of non-supervised training intervention for both groups. Biological samples will&#xD;
      be analysed in Biodonostia Health Research Institute and in the University of the Basque&#xD;
      Country (UPV/EHU).&#xD;

      Study protocol: Acute hospitalised, community-dwelling elderly patients will be recruited at&#xD;
      internal medicine service of the Araba University Hospital (HUA). Patients that fulfil&#xD;
      eligibility criteria for the study will be evaluated during their hospitalization for&#xD;
      different aspects (Hospital Evaluation): handgrip, nutritional assessment using Mini&#xD;
      Nutritional Assessment- Short Form Test (MNA-SF), functional assessment by Short Physical&#xD;
      Performance Battery (SPPB), cognitive assessment (Pfeiffer test) and frailty assessment&#xD;
      (Fried test). Once hospital evaluation is assessed patients will be offered to participate in&#xD;
      the study. In case patients accept to participate, another assessment will be carried out on&#xD;
      discharge date (Discharge Day Evaluation): handgrip, functional assessment (SPPB), 30-Second&#xD;
      Chair Stand Test, 30-Second Arm Curl Test, the Timed Up ang Go (TUG) Test, 8 Foot Up and Go&#xD;
      (FUG) Test, Gait Speed Test for 4- meters and for 8-meters. Patients will also take two&#xD;
      accelerometers, a wrist accelerometer and a hip accelerometer, for a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A week after discharge day, patients will again be evaluated (Laboratory 1 (Lab 1) evaluation&#xD;
      day): the same tests of discharge day will be repeated plus Berg Scale and 6-Minute Walking&#xD;
      Test. Then, patients will wait until a group of 5-6 participants is formed. As soon as&#xD;
      patients accept to participate, and when all evaluation tests involved until Lab 1 evaluation&#xD;
      day are completed, participants will be randomized into two different groups: exercise&#xD;
      training plus placebo control group (Group 1) and exercise training plus leucine-enriched&#xD;
      protein ingestion intervention group (Group 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be called by telephone a week before the intervention starts for&#xD;
      psychological assessment, blood analysis and Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA)&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first day of intervention program all participants will be evaluated for nutritional&#xD;
      assessment: Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) Test, a quantitative score (14-item) of&#xD;
      adherence to the Mediterranean diet (Prevention with Mediterranean Diet (PREDIMED)&#xD;
      questionnaire), two non-consecutive 24-hour dietary recall and anthropometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise training intervention will be divided into supervised intervention and&#xD;
      non-supervised intervention for both groups. Supervised intervention program will take 12&#xD;
      weeks and participants will have to assist 2 non-consecutive days per week to hospital for&#xD;
      1-hour exercise training. After those 12 weeks participants will take two accelerometers, a&#xD;
      wrist accelerometer and a hip accelerometer, for a week. After that week participants will&#xD;
      have to assist 2 non-consecutive days on the same week to complete: the same physical tests&#xD;
      of Lab 1 evaluation day, anthropometry and nutritional tests, blood analysis and DEXA&#xD;
      assessment. Individualised physical exercise recommendations will be explained and given to&#xD;
      participants for the following 12 weeks of non-supervised intervention. During those weeks of&#xD;
      non-supervised intervention, telephone monitoring will be made every two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When completing the study, at week 24, participants will be called by telephone to come to&#xD;
      hospital for blood analysis, psychological assessment, nutritional tests and one 24-hour&#xD;
      dietary recall, and to take the two accelerometers for a week. After a week, participants&#xD;
      will be evaluated for physical assessment (the same physical tests of Lab 1 evaluation day&#xD;
      will be carried out) and a second 24-hour dietary recall and anthropometry will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The placebo and leucine-enriched protein supplementation will only be taken during supervised&#xD;
      training period twice a week after 1-hour exercise training is completed. Participants will&#xD;
      ignore what the supplement is, as the mixtures will be codified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protein supplementation will consist on 20gr of whey protein (a commercial preparation of&#xD;
      Davisco®: BiPRO all-natural whey protein isolate) enriched with 3g of leucine (commercially&#xD;
      prepared by Nutricia), and protein mixture will be diluted with 100ml of water. The placebo&#xD;
      will be an energy-matched mixture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The samples will be store at the Basque Biobank and then will be send to Biodonostia Health&#xD;
      Research Institute for their analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: power calculation has been done for the main variable: muscle mass increase. If&#xD;
      35 people are recruited on each group, a difference of unless 1.5 to 2kg will be detected in&#xD;
      muscle mass with a standard deviation of 1.5-1.7kg and &gt;80% of power, and an alfa level of&#xD;
      0.05. Taking into account that mortality can be about 30%, 40 participants will be recruited&#xD;
      for each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: variance analysis will be used to analyse the continuous variables and&#xD;
      the Chi-square test for the categorical variables, both analyses will be used for the&#xD;
      cross-cutting analysis. To evaluate the training effect on the primary and secondary&#xD;
      variables general linear models will be used. Age and the pre-intervention value of any&#xD;
      primary or secondary variable will be considered as covariates. The effect size and the&#xD;
      statistical significance level for each of these effects will be calculated: group effect&#xD;
      (between subjects), time effect (intra-subjects) and group*time interaction. Other possible&#xD;
      interactions between group*sex and all other variables of the study will be determined. The&#xD;
      analyses will be adjusted by multiple comparison test and the intend to treat principle will&#xD;
      be applied for all analyses. For the analysis of missing data, such as for the participants&#xD;
      that drop out from the program or did not meet the study criteria, different imputation&#xD;
      methods will be used, and sensitivity analysis will be applied.&#xD;
