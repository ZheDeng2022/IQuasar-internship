  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether high grade epithelial ovarian cancers (=HG&#xD;
      EOC) are 18F-DCFPyL&#xD;
      (=2-(3-(1-carboxy-5-[(6-[18F]fluoro-pyridine-3-carbonyl)-amino]-pentyl)-ureido)-pentanedioic&#xD;
      acid)-avid and to compare the performance of this PET to CT and findings at time of surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a need for better noninvasive tools that will map disease extent in HG EOC. A recent&#xD;
      study has shown that at immunohistochemistry GCP=II is overexpressed in ovarian cancer&#xD;
      tumors, both primary and metastatic. Glucose carboxypeptidase-II (=GCP-II), also known as&#xD;
      prostate specific membrane antigen (= PSMA) has been used clinically to assess patients with&#xD;
      prostate cancer and many other tumors have been shown to be PSMA-avid on PET (including renal&#xD;
      cell carcinomas).&#xD;
&#xD;
      18F-DCFPyL has the potential to improve patient selection for primary therapy. If successful,&#xD;
      this may decrease the rate of futile surgeries and associated morbidity and better direct&#xD;
      patients to the most appropriate therapy primary debulking surgery (PDS) vs neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy (NACT). Furthermore, if high-level GCP-II expression is shown at preoperative&#xD;
      imaging in patients with HG EOC, this may be used in considering feasibility of future&#xD;
      theranostic applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single arm pilot study to assess whether HG EOC are 18F-DCFPyL-avid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective trial, the investigators will recruit 20 women whom will undergo&#xD;
      conventional staging with contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis as per standard of&#xD;
      care. All disease sites, primary and metastatic will be recorded using a standardized&#xD;
      reporting template.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, 18F-DCFPyL-PET/CT will be performed (within 6 weeks of CT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All disease sites on PET will be recorded using same reporting template in addition to&#xD;
      qualitative and semiquantitative evaluation (SUV measurement) of all known tumor sites.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with ovarian cancer, identifying the volume and exact locations of disease is of&#xD;
      paramount importance prior to deciding on upfront surgery versus chemotherapy. Currently,&#xD;
      most clinicians use CT scans to determine the extent of disease; however, this tool has&#xD;
      limited sensitivity and specificity. 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (=FDG) PET scans have been&#xD;
      previously assessed with only limited success; therefore, FDG PET scans have not been&#xD;
      universally incorporated into the workup of patients with ovarian cancer. A further&#xD;
      noninvasive tool that would accurately map disease extent is needed to better select therapy&#xD;
      for ovarian cancer patients, reduce the rate of aborted surgery and associated complications,&#xD;
      and hopefully improve overall outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCP-II)&quot; is a type of an enzyme on the surface of cells. It&#xD;
      has additional names including prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA). It is expressed by&#xD;
      normal tissues such as salivary glands, as well as by multiple malignant tumors, often in the&#xD;
      abnormal blood vessels of these tumors. A recent study has examined the expression of this&#xD;
      enzyme in gynecologic cancers including primary and metastatic ovarian cancer. The authors&#xD;
      showed a high expression of this enzyme at special staining performed on surgical tumor&#xD;
      samples. In other cancers, such as prostate cancer PET with GCP-II (=PSMA PET) has shown very&#xD;
      high sensitivity and high specificity for the detection of tumor sites, even when CT is&#xD;
      negative. In this study the investigators will be assessing the performance of this special&#xD;
      PET scan using a PSMA tracer called &quot;18F-DCFPyL&quot;. The investigators will investigate the&#xD;
      ability of 18F-DCFPyL PET scans to detect sites of disease in patients with ovarian cancer.&#xD;
      Disease sites seen on PET will be compared to what is seen on the standard CT scan, and to&#xD;
      what is found at time of surgery (if surgery is performed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for this study is that there is a need for better noninvasive tools that will&#xD;
      map disease extent in HG EOC. A recent study has shown that at immunohistochemistry GCP=II is&#xD;
      overexpressed in ovarian cancer tumors, both primary and metastatic. GCP-II (=PSMA) has been&#xD;
      used clinically to assess patients with prostate cancer and many other tumours have been&#xD;
      shown to be PSMA-avid on PET (including renal cell carcinomas). The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to determine whether HG SOC are 18F-DCFPyL (=GCP-II)-avid and to compare the performance of&#xD;
      this PET to CT and findings at time of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether HG EOCs are 18F-DCFPyL avid on PET/CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the sites of disease identified on PET/CT to contrast-enhanced CT (standard of&#xD;
      care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether there is heterogeneity in 18F-DCFPyL-avidity at different tumor sites.&#xD;
