  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the year 2000, a group of specialists with an interest in contact dermatitis and&#xD;
      photobiology/photophysics set up a taskforce under the umbrella of the European Society for&#xD;
      Contact Dermatitis and the European Society for Photodermatology. This came about as a result&#xD;
      of an awareness, that photopatch testing was under-used, there were inconsistencies in&#xD;
      methodology and scoring of results, and there was a lack of up-to-date choice of test&#xD;
      photoallergens. A consensus on the methodology of photopatch testing arose from this,&#xD;
      although some inconsistencies on the methodology could not be solved and variations on the&#xD;
      technique were accepted. Since then a European multicentre photopatch test study (EMCPPTS)&#xD;
      was conducted in 30 clinics from 2008-2011. The EMCPPTS test agents comprised 19 UV&#xD;
      absorbers, and 5 topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs available in Europe. More than&#xD;
      1,000 patients took part in this study that showed that ketoprofen and related chemicals and&#xD;
      classical UV-filters were the main photoallergens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since then the taskforce have met again (2012) and on the basis of the results of the&#xD;
      ECMPPTS, on previous publications reporting cases of photoallergic contact dermatitis, and on&#xD;
      the presence or absence of these agents in consumer products within the European market or&#xD;
      other accessible markets, 20 substances were chosen to form the baseline European photopatch&#xD;
      test series. Fifteen additional substances were chosen to be included in the extended&#xD;
      photopatch test series which may be used as an additional screen alongside patients' own&#xD;
      product. Twenty-six other agents that are no longer produced or are no longer used in the&#xD;
      European markets have been considered to be no longer relevant for regular photopatch testing&#xD;
      and were removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was suggested from this taskforce that the study should be repeated in approximately five&#xD;
      years, as it is expected that new photoallergens will continue to emerge despite&#xD;
      pre-marketing screening measures. Therefore members of this taskforce subsequently met in&#xD;
      2015, to discuss the aim of performing a very similar study, commencing in 2016. However, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to focus specifically on methodology as in all previous studies a variety&#xD;
      of methods of photopatch testing have been utilised. The investigators therefore aim to&#xD;
      improve standardisation of this test. This agreed methodology will therefore enable better&#xD;
      comparative studies in the future and hopefully encourage greater numbers of would-be users&#xD;
      of this form of patch testing, as due to a previous level of uncertainty, many general&#xD;
      dermatologists have been discouraged from using this technique.&#xD;

      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the frequency of photoallergic and allergic reactions to the most recently&#xD;
           recommended battery of allergens used in photopatch testing in Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare, within the same individual, photopatch tests results when the tests are&#xD;
           irradiated at 24hr or 48hr in order to determine whether one or other time point is&#xD;
           superior with respect to pick-up of relevant positive photoallergic reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate whether use of an additional 7 day, late reading yields new and relevant&#xD;
      reactions that increase the diagnostic capacity of photopatch testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Chief Investigator (CI) for the study is Dr Niki Ralph, Dublin. All centres will each&#xD;
      have a lead clinical dermatologist with a special interest in contact dermatitis or&#xD;
      photobiology/photophysics. Many of these lead dermatologists have also been part of the&#xD;
      taskforce in the last 16 years of studies/meetings surrounding this topic. Each lead&#xD;
      dermatologist will have a multidisciplinary team at their centres and be regularly involved&#xD;
      in patch/photopatch testing. Dundee will be the main co-ordinating site for the UK. Patients&#xD;
      who are attending for patch/photopatch testing at each of these centres will be offered&#xD;
      inclusion in the study. The primary indication for this form of testing includes dermatitis&#xD;
      predominantly affecting exposed sites with or without a history of a reaction to sunscreen,&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drug or related agents and patients who are being investigated for&#xD;
      photosensitivity diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants &amp; Recruitment Each patient will be given a participant information sheet (PIS.&#xD;
      Appendix 1) and have at least 24 hours to read through this. They will also be given the&#xD;
      opportunity to speak with a member of the research team, as contact details will be provided&#xD;
      on the patient information sheet or they may wish to have any questions answered in person,&#xD;
      during their consultation at the outpatient clinic, before they are invited to sign a&#xD;
      standardised informed consent form (Appendix 2) prior to recruitment into the study. No study&#xD;
      activity will take place until the patient has given written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology The patients will attend the clinic +/- two hours the same time each day (Table&#xD;
      1). Three sets of patch tests will be applied on 8mm Finn chambers to the back, or another&#xD;
      body site if necessary, to facilitate the number of patchtest chambers required. One set for&#xD;
      standard patch testing according to the International Contact Dermatitis Research Group&#xD;
      (ICDDRG) criteria, one set of the agreed baseline 23 photoallergen series for irradiation at&#xD;
      24 hours and one set of the agreed baseline 23photoallergen series for irradiation at 48&#xD;
      hours, according to this study protocol. There is also an extended series of photoallergens.&#xD;
      Patients may also be tested to this series, or only individual allergens from this series as&#xD;
      deemed appropriate by their clinician, based on their medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation Randomisation will be undertaken using a computer-generated randomisation&#xD;
      sequence, taking into account which sites are applied for 24h/48h and which sites are&#xD;
      irradiated/not irradiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Readings of the patch tests will be interpreted as follows (Table 1):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 0 (D0) Day 1 (D1) Day2 (D2) Day 3 (D3) (if feasible) Day 4 (D4) Day 7 (D7-late reading)&#xD;
      (if feasible) Application of 2 identical sets of patch tests (PTs) Application of 3rd (final&#xD;
      set) of identical PTs Removal of all PT's from the back. Reading of all sets of PT's&#xD;
      Irradiation of 2 sets of PTs (24 &amp; 48 hour irradiation) Immediate reading post irradiation&#xD;
      Reading of PPTs (24 hour) Reading of PPTs (48 hour) Late reading of PPTs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minimal Erythema Dose (MED) testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who attend the photobiology centres may have a UVA MED test performed and recorded&#xD;
      on the photopathc test recording sheet. (Appendix 3) For centres who are mainly contact&#xD;
      allergy centres, they will use a standard dose of 5J/cm² UVA for patients who are not&#xD;
      phototested or who have normal phototesting and those with moderate photosensitivity will be&#xD;
      tested to 2.5J/cm² and those with severe photosensitivity will be tested using 1J/cm² UVA and&#xD;
      this will be at the discretion of the study clinician at each centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meter Calibration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All UVA meters from the 13 included centres will be calibrated to ensure standardisation&#xD;
      (prior to study use) in Dundee, Scotland, by Dr Ewan Eadie, Head of Scientific Services for&#xD;
      Photobiology and Optical Radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessor blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be incorporated by all 13 centres, so that the assessor does not know which site is&#xD;
      irradiated and also which are the 24 or 48 hour sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessing clinicians will be unaware of the ordering of the set of patches (24hr vs 48hr)&#xD;
      allocated on the back. This will be achieved by the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessors will not be aware of the randomization schedule Assessors will not see the patches&#xD;
      applied to the skin, but will only see the back/other areas once patches have been removed.&#xD;
      The aim of this is to improve assessment robustness&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding will be broken in the event of a serious adverse event, or at study clinician&#xD;
      request, due to clinical need. A copy of the open randomisation code will be stored in a&#xD;
      locked cupboard in the clinic. This can be accessed in the event of an emergency requirement&#xD;
      to break the blind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sunscreen series/Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) series:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who agree to take part in the study will be offered testing to the entire&#xD;
      sunscreen and NSAID series. However, topical NSAIDs are much more widely used in Continental&#xD;
      Europe and, some patients, particularly in the UK, may not be aware of ever having been&#xD;
      exposed to a topical NSAID. Patients who do not wish to be tested to NSAID's as they feel&#xD;
      these may not be relevant to their individual situation can continue to participate in the&#xD;
      study, however will only be tested to the sunscreen series +/- NSAIDs.&#xD;
&#xD;

      Study Assessments During the study duration the data will be recorded onto a standardised&#xD;
      photopatch test form (Appendix 3) and at the end of the study all forms will be collected&#xD;
      from each individual study centre, under the direction of the local principal investigator&#xD;
      (PI). These data will then be collated once all participants have been recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collective data will then undergo statistical analysis by the statistician at the Lead CI&#xD;
      centre in Dublin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Funding No external funding has been sought by the UK Investigators. The CI has secured minor&#xD;
      funding from The City of Dublin Skin and Cancer Hospital Charity and from the EADV. Funding&#xD;
      is available for reimbursement of participant travel expenses for up to the two extra visits&#xD;
      (Up to 10 Euro per each visit) (Appendix 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis The collective data will undergo statistical analysis by the&#xD;
      statistician at the Lead CI centre in Dublin in order to investigate whether there is a&#xD;
      difference between 24h versus 48h allergen application or whether addition of a late seven&#xD;
      day reading increases the yield of relevant positive reactions. The investigators estimated,&#xD;
      using Stata 14.1 (Stata Corp., Texas, 2016) that 189 completing subjects would give 90% power&#xD;
      to detect as significant, at an alpha level of 0.05, a difference (assuming two-tailed&#xD;
      testing) of 10% between within-subjects proportions of identified reactions at the 2&#xD;
      different randomly allocated durations of application of patches. This estimate was also&#xD;
      based on the conservative assumption of an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.01, in the&#xD;
      absence of previous study data on which to base this estimate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility This study's success is dependent on being able to acquire sufficient numbers of&#xD;
      patients to undergo photopatch testing. Based on previous studies in this area, (from this&#xD;
      taskforce) the investigators envisage that this will be possible but will require a lead&#xD;
      coordinator (Dr Niki Ralph for Europe, Dr Sally Ibboston for UK) to oversee and conduct the&#xD;
      study and be contactable on a regular basis by all centres to ensure the protocol is&#xD;
      understood by the lead dermatologist and their team whom are involved in the study&#xD;
      (doctors/nurses/physicists etc.) and to ensure that the exact protocol is being adhered to&#xD;
      and the data are being collected and recorded according to the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study centres who have agreed to be part of this study all have lead dermatologists who&#xD;
      have a special interest in the areas of contact dermatitis, photobiology and photophysics and&#xD;
      have participated in such studies in the past; hence we do not anticipate difficulties with&#xD;
      acquiring large numbers of patients to undergo such testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Failure of the project could occur if patients did not attend on a regular basis for the&#xD;
      interpretation of their test results. This is not envisaged by the group, as patients who&#xD;
      attend for this form of patch testing are usually very enthusiastic about identifying the&#xD;
      possible cause of their cutaneous reaction, hence compliance is usually very high. The&#xD;
      addition of the late reading after a weekend break from the hospital may prove difficult for&#xD;
      some patients, due to geographical location but is not a mandatory time-point for readings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data processing The data will be recorded on the standardised patchtest recording sheet for&#xD;
      each individual patient participating in the study. The results will be stored in the&#xD;
      patients' medical record in each individual centre and an anonymous copy will be sent to the&#xD;
      P.I. Dr Niki Ralph. The photopatch recording sheets are anonymous. There will also be a&#xD;
      master/consent log at each site linking the participant name to the number. Dr Ralph will&#xD;
      record all data from the 13 centres on an Excel spreadsheet, which will be stored on a&#xD;
      password encrypted, powered off computer, in a locked office. All data will be kept for the&#xD;
      duration necessary to create publications and presentations at both national and&#xD;
      international level, for approximately 5 years post completion of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chief investigator reserves the right to conduct an audit of the informed consent process&#xD;
      at each study site Insurance The coordinator for each centre is covered by their individual&#xD;
      hospital indemnity and their own personal indemnity through an insurance provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific Justification This study will contribute to the promotion of excellence in&#xD;
      clinical care by investigation optimisation of an important diagnostic test in dermatology.&#xD;
      It joins two special interest societies, the ESCD &amp; ESPD who are collaborating to undertake a&#xD;
      multi-centre study to define the prevalence of the most commonly encountered photoallergens&#xD;
      in Europe and the most appropriate methodology for photopatch testing across Europe. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to clarify the best method for photopatch testing to create a standard&#xD;
      method, which could be a baseline study for all other European studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hope to act as advocates for patients and both consultant and trainee&#xD;
      dermatologists and nurses and technologists; by involving them in a study, which will benefit&#xD;
      the patients in the diagnosis of their skin condition and will assist in teaching and&#xD;
      training of those involved in delivering photopatch test services. Publishing the findings in&#xD;
      peer-reviewed journals and presenting at national and international dermatology meetings will&#xD;
      be of major importance in dissemination of new knowledge obtained in the course this study&#xD;
      and will contribute to the specialty of Dermatology by educating its members including those&#xD;
      in sub-specialty groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the correct identification of the causes of photoallergic dermatitis, namely in&#xD;
      multi-centre studies, may give important indications to the institutions that deal with the&#xD;
      safety of consumers and to the cosmetic/pharmaceutical industry in order to eliminate or&#xD;
      reduce exposure to frequent photoallergens and, therefore, improve the quality of health of&#xD;
      European citizens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion Thus, at the conclusion of this study the investigators will have validated the&#xD;
      European standard battery of photoallergens and be able to advise on the likely frequency of&#xD;
      reactions to specific photoallergens and which are the most common culprits and defined the&#xD;
      optimal methodology to use for photopatch testing, with either a 24h or 48h allergen&#xD;
      irradiation time-point (or indeed if no difference is found then investigators will also be&#xD;
      advised that either regime is appropriate). As a secondary objective if sufficient late 7 day&#xD;
      reading data points are obtained, the investigators may be able to semi-quantitatively&#xD;
      ascertain whether there is value in inclusion of this late time-point for reading photopatch&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination of Knowledge Gained The information gained from this study will be presented&#xD;
      widely at National and International photobiology and dermatology meetings and will be&#xD;
      published in peer-reviewed scientific journals.&#xD;
