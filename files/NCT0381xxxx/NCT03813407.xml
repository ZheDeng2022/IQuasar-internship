  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate has been shown to be effective and safe in adults for the&#xD;
      treatment of hyperkalaemia, and therefore it is expected to be beneficial in children. This&#xD;
      study will evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate&#xD;
      for the treatment of hyperkalaemia in children &lt;18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:28-day maintenance phase (MP) primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the effect of SZC vs placebo on maintaining normokalaemia during the MP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correction phase (CP) primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate SZC efficacy of different dose levels on achieving normokalaemia during the CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 140 participants will be enrolled at approximately 45 sites in locations&#xD;
      including but not limited to Europe and North America for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will include 3 phases: the CP, MP, and LTMP. Participants from 2 to &lt;18 years are&#xD;
      eligible to participate in all phases of the study. Participants &lt;2 years of age will be&#xD;
      included in the first 2 phases, namely the CP and the MP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, participants are recommended to be fasting prior to any visit pre-dose&#xD;
      laboratory testing. All laboratory tests are taken pre-dose except select post dose K+ values&#xD;
      during the CP. Electrocardiograms are to be taken prior to dosing. On visit days, the study&#xD;
      treatment is to be taken at the site (during the CP this pertains only to the morning dose).&#xD;
      For participants with diabetes, K+ measurements should be performed prior to insulin&#xD;
      administration where possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For inclusion into the study i-STAT is used. For subsequent decisions on eligibility and&#xD;
      determination of hyper and normokalaemia for entry into the MP and LTMP phases, local&#xD;
      laboratory K+ is the determinant value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tolerability and safety will be assessed using AE reporting, results from laboratory testing,&#xD;
      vital signs, physical examinations and ECG findings during the study. Care will be taken not&#xD;
      to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open ended non leading verbal questioning&#xD;
      of the participant or participant's legal representative, as appropriate, is the preferred&#xD;
      method to inquire about AE occurrences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are allowed to discontinue the study treatment and assessments at any time or at&#xD;
      the discretion of the Investigator(s). The independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC) will&#xD;
      monitor data during all phases of the study including DL evaluations.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Overall design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 140 participants will be enrolled at approximately 45 sites in locations&#xD;
      including but not limited to Europe and North America for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will include 3 phases: the CP, MP, and LTMP. Participants from 2 to &lt;18 years are&#xD;
      eligible to participate in all phases of the study. Participants &lt;2 years of age will be&#xD;
      included in the first 2 phases, namely the CP and the MP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, participants are recommended to be fasting prior to any visit pre-dose&#xD;
      laboratory testing. All laboratory tests are taken pre-dose except select post dose K+ values&#xD;
      during the CP. Electrocardiograms are to be taken prior to dosing. On visit days, the study&#xD;
      treatment is to be taken at the site (during the CP this pertains only to the morning dose).&#xD;
      For participants with diabetes, K+ measurements should be performed prior to insulin&#xD;

      determination of hyper and normokalaemia for entry into the MP and LTMP phases, local&#xD;
      laboratory K+ is the determinant value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tolerability and safety will be assessed using AE reporting, results from laboratory testing,&#xD;
      vital signs, physical examinations and ECG findings during the study. Care will be taken not&#xD;
      to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open ended non leading verbal questioning&#xD;
      of the participant or participant's legal representative, as appropriate, is the preferred&#xD;
      method to inquire about AE occurrences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are allowed to discontinue the study treatment and assessments at any time or at&#xD;
      the discretion of the Investigator(s). Participants and their legal representatives are also&#xD;
      free to withdraw from the study at any time, without prejudice to further treatment.&#xD;
      Participants who discontinue study treatment for any reason during MP or LTMP will be&#xD;
      followed up and are encouraged to continue to be monitored according to the protocol&#xD;
      schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC) will monitor data during all phases of the&#xD;
      study including DL evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated date of first participant enrolled Q4 2018 Estimated date of last participant&#xD;
      completed Q4 2024&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enrol approximately 140 participants into the CP in order to achieve entry of&#xD;
      at least 90 participants into the MP. Of the 140 participants enrolled, ≥5 participants&#xD;
      should be in the birth to &lt;2 years cohort. Additionally, the 90 (or greater) participants who&#xD;
      enter the MP should include ≥30 participants in the 12 to &lt;18 years cohort, ≥30 participants&#xD;
      in the 6 to &lt;12 years cohort, and ≥10 participants in the 2 to &lt;6 years cohort. At least 45&#xD;
      participants randomised in the MP should have a Screening i-STAT-K+ level (using the mean of&#xD;
      the 2 consecutive i-STAT-K+ measurements at Screening) of &gt;5.5 mmol/L. A minimum number of 75&#xD;
      participants must continue study treatment throughout the MP (≥25 participants in the 12 to&#xD;
      &lt;18 years cohort, ≥25 participants in the 6 to &lt;12 years cohort, and ≥8 participants in the 2&#xD;
      to &lt;6 years cohort). Hence, randomisation in the MP will continue until it can be predicted&#xD;
      that at least 75 participants fulfilling the specific age cohort requirements will complete&#xD;
      the MP without premature discontinuation of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on data from adult study SZC-004, the proportion of responders (participant with&#xD;
      maintained normokalaemia throughout the MP) can be assumed to be 37% and 12% in the SZC and&#xD;
      placebo treatment groups, respectively. Forty-two participants per group will then provide&#xD;
      approximately 77% power using a chi-square test at 5% significance level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments and treatment duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will include 3 phases: the CP, MP, and LTMP. Participants from 2 to &lt;18 years&#xD;
      requiring chronic treatment for hyperkalaemia are eligible to participate in all phases of&#xD;
      the study if entry criteria are met. Participants &lt;2 years of age requiring acute or chronic&#xD;
      treatment for hyperkalaemia will be included in the first 2 phases, namely the CP and the MP.&#xD;
      The 3 treatment phases are specified below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An open-label CP during which SZC is administered orally 3 times daily (TID) prior to&#xD;
           breakfast, midday, and evening for 1 to 3 days to achieve normokalaemia in participants&#xD;
           from birth to &lt;18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A 28-day MP during which SZC or placebo is administered in a randomised, double-blind&#xD;
           manner orally once daily (QD) to maintain normokalaemia in participants from 2 to &lt;18&#xD;
           years. Participants aged &lt;2 years will continue treatment in the MP with open-label QD&#xD;
           oral SZC active treatment if medically indicated by the treating physician. In cohorts 2&#xD;
           to &lt;18 years, at the end of the MP (Visit 8a), the Investigator will unblind the MP&#xD;
           treatment to determine eligibility for the LTMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An open-label LTMP during which SZC is administered QD for up to 22 weeks for&#xD;
           participants aged 2 to &lt;18 years who either maintain normokalaemia on active drug during&#xD;
           the MP or are hyperkalaemic on active drug or placebo during the MP. Continuation into&#xD;
           this phase is optional and will be determined by the Investigator based on the&#xD;
           participant's need for long term treatment. Dose titration for individual participants&#xD;
           will only be an option in this phase after data is evaluated by the iDMC and the next DL&#xD;
           is opened.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose levels are derived from doses of SZC previously used in the adult population, by&#xD;
      adjusting for paediatric body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Monitoring Committee:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An iDMC will be utilised for this study to evaluate emerging safety data during all phases of&#xD;
      the study in addition to DL evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, CP data will be presented by dose. Maintenance phase data will be presented by&#xD;
      treatment, denoted by SZC or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the LTMP, the open-label SZC dose can be titrated. Summaries by dose will however be done&#xD;
      based on the dose the participant was initially on when starting the LTMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential effect of SZC will be examined for different sub-groups (eg, age) when&#xD;
      appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No interim analyses are planned for this study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Provision of written informed consent of the participant or legal representative, and&#xD;
             informed assent from the participant (as appropriate).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Female or male from birth to &lt;18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participants (including those receiving a stable peritoneal dialysis regimen)&#xD;
             requiring long term treatment of hyperkalaemia (chronic hyperkalaemia) in the age&#xD;
             cohort ≥2 years, and participants requiring either short- or long-term treatment for&#xD;
             hyperkalaemia (acute and chronic hyperkalaemia) in the age cohort &lt;2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participants must meet 1 of the following criteria for hyperkalaemia:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. For participants ≥2 years of age, mean i STAT K+ level &gt;5.0 mmol/L at Screening.&#xD;
                  Two consecutive i STAT K+ values, measured 60 (±15) minutes apart, both &gt;5.0&#xD;
                  mmol/L and measured within 1 day before the first dose of SZC on CP Study Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. For participants &lt;2 years of age, i STAT K+ level &gt;6.0 mmol/L at Screening,&#xD;
                  measured within 1 day before the first dose of SZC on CP Study Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note that if Day 1 is the same as the Screening day, the 60 (±15) minute K+ value is&#xD;
             the same as the Day 1 time 0 K+ value. However, if Day 1 is not the same day as&#xD;
             Screening, then the participant will actually have 3 i STAT-K+ values measured before&#xD;
             starting treatment in the CP and the third value which is taken on Day 1 time 0 must&#xD;
             also be hyperkalaemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Using digital ECG, QT interval corrected by Bazett's method (QTcB) must meet the&#xD;
             age-appropriate parameters at Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. For participants aged 0 to ≤3 days after birth: &lt;450 ms&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. For participants aged &gt;3 days to &lt;12 years: &lt;440 ms&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. For participants ≥12 to &lt;18 years: &lt;450 ms (male), &lt;460 ms (female) All QTcB&#xD;
                  values outside the reference values specified in the protocol should be manually&#xD;
                  re-measured and re-calculated, and if there is a difference in measurement&#xD;
                  between the automatic and manual ECG, the manual measurement should always be&#xD;
                  considered correct.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Ability to have repeated blood draws or effective venous catheterisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 1 day&#xD;
             prior to the first dose of SZC on CP Study Day 1 and sexually active females of&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Participants with hyperkalaemia due to soft-tissue damage from crush injury or burns.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Participants with hyperkalaemia due to a secondary cause, such as dehydration,&#xD;
             excessive use of K+ supplements, or drug use (eg, beta-adrenergic antagonists) and&#xD;
             that would be more appropriately treated with other interventions (eg, fluid&#xD;
