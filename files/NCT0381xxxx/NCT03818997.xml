    <textblock>
      In this study, non-operable esophagogastric adenocarcinoma cancer patients or non-operable&#xD;
      biliary cancer patients whose cancer progressed/spread/got worse after first line treatment&#xD;
      will be treated with or without immunotherapy and chemotherapy. This study will take place in&#xD;
      several countries across Europe. One hundred twenty-three (123) patients will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biliary tract cancer (BTC), is a form of cancer that start in your bile ducts, a series of&#xD;
      tubes that runs from the liver to the small intestines. It is not know yet the exact cause of&#xD;
      BTC. For patients who have advanced or metastatic BTC (where surgery is not possible),&#xD;
      chemotherapy is the first option for treatment. Chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine&#xD;
      (CisGem) is the current standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esophagogastric cancer (EGC) is cancer that occurs in the esophagus, a long hollow tube that&#xD;
      runs from your throat to your stomach. The accumulating abnormal cells form a tumor in the&#xD;
      esophagus that can grow to invade nearby structures and spread to other parts of the body.&#xD;
      It's thought that chronic irritation of your esophagus may contribute to the changes that&#xD;
      cause esophageal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to look at the risks and benefits of combining DKN-01 and&#xD;
      atezolizumab (humanized monoclonal antibody) with or without paclitaxel (chemotherapy).&#xD;
      Immune therapy boosts the body's natural defenses to fight cancer. It uses specific products&#xD;
      made either by participants' body or in a laboratory to improve, target or restore immune&#xD;
      system function and control or stop cancer. Atezolizumab is such an &quot;immunotherapy&quot; drug.&#xD;
      DKN-01 is another new type of drug (humanized monoclonal antibody) in development as&#xD;
      anticancer agent. Paclitaxel is a commonly-used chemotherapy drug of the class of taxanes&#xD;
      used to treat a number of cancer types, it stimulates the cell to die or to stop the cell&#xD;
      from dividing into two new cells.The idea behind combining these drugs is linked to targeting&#xD;
      the immune system to attack the tumor. Combining immune and chemotherapy has already&#xD;
      demonstrated clinical activity in relapsed (return of the disease)/refractory (not responding&#xD;
      to treatment) esophagogastric cancer patients.&#xD;

                  [with macroscopic residual disease] or palliative bypass surgery only), performed&#xD;
                  at least 28 days before randomization/enrollment. Patients who have previously&#xD;
