      The purpose of this pharmacokinetic (PK) study is to evaluate if a double dose (3 mg) of&#xD;
      levonorgestrel (LNG) emergency contraception (EC) overcomes known drug-drug interactions&#xD;
      (DDIs) with efavirenz (EFV)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) or rifampicin (RIF)-containing&#xD;
      tuberculosis (TB) therapy. The safety of double-dose (3.0 mg) LNG EC versus standard-dose&#xD;
      (1.5 mg) will also be compared.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pharmacokinetic (PK) study will evaluate if a double dose (3.0 mg) of levonorgestrel&#xD;
      (LNG) emergency contraception (EC) overcomes known drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with&#xD;
      efavirenz (EFV)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) or rifampicin (RIF)-containing&#xD;
      tuberculosis (TB) therapy. The safety of double-dose (3.0 mg) LNG EC versus standard-dose&#xD;
      (1.5 mg) will also be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be volunteers who do not currently require EC for contraception. This study&#xD;
      will enroll women who are 16 years of age or older. Group assignment will be determined by&#xD;
      infection status (HIV or TB; participants cannot be coinfected), and, for those who are&#xD;
      living with HIV, by ART regimen at enrollment. Women living with HIV who are taking EFV-based&#xD;
      ART will be randomized to receive a standard dose LNG EC (Group A) or a double dose of LNG EC&#xD;
      (Group B). Women taking dolutegravir (DTG)-based ART will be assigned to a standard dose of&#xD;
      LNG EC (Group C). Women who are HIV-negative and in the continuation phase of active TB&#xD;
      treatment taking RIF and isoniazid (INH) will be assigned to a double dose of LNG EC (Group&#xD;
      D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At study entry, participants in Groups A and C will receive a standard single dose of LNG EC.&#xD;
      Participants in Groups B and D will receive a double dose of LNG EC. Intensive PK monitoring&#xD;
      will be conducted pre-dose, and after the LNG EC dose. Women are expected to be at the&#xD;
      clinical site while the initial 8 hour PK samples are collected and may return for the 24 and&#xD;
      48 hour samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will complete self-report questionnaires to assess adherence to TB therapy&#xD;
      and ART, menstrual history and patterns after LNG EC administration, and to collect adverse&#xD;
      effects commonly reported with LNG EC (i.e., irregular bleeding patterns). Adherence to ART&#xD;
      and RIF will be assessed by collecting hair samples and single plasma concentrations at&#xD;
      entry. All participants will be followed for 4 weeks.&#xD;
