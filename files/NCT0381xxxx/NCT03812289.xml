    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well stereotactic body radiation therapy works in treating patients&#xD;
      with liver cancer. Stereotactic body radiation therapy uses special equipment to position a&#xD;
      patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This method can kill tumor cells&#xD;
      with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the use of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
      (HCC) patients with advanced liver cirrhosis as a feasible approach to providing localized&#xD;
      disease control that adequately suffices liver transplant eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess preliminary efficacy and toxicity in HCC patients with advanced cirrhosis following&#xD;
      liver SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess qualify of life in HCC patients with advanced cirrhosis following liver SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo SBRT on days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 weeks, then every 3 months&#xD;
      for up to 2 years.&#xD;
