    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of TAK-243 in treating patients&#xD;
      with acute myeloid leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome, or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia&#xD;
      that has come back or that is not responding to treatment. TAK-243 may stop the growth of&#xD;
      cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To establish the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ubiquitin-activating enzyme (UAE)&#xD;
      inhibitor TAK-243 (MLN7243 [TAK-243]) administered intravenously in a twice-weekly schedule&#xD;
      in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or patients with myelodysplastic syndromes&#xD;
      (MDS) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) refractory to hypomethylating agents (HMAs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) evaluated on the first cycle (Day 1 to 21) of&#xD;
      MLN7243 (TAK-243), its safety profile, and dose limiting toxicities (DLT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To investigate preliminary anti-leukemic activity of MLN7243 (TAK-243) monotherapy in&#xD;
      patients with AML, MDS and CMML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To relate responses to the molecular/cytogenetic abnormalities in the malignant cells or&#xD;
      to pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To describe the PK of MLN7243 (TAK-243). V. To describe the PD profile of MLN7243&#xD;
      (TAK-243) in the study population. VI. To establish the RP2D of MLN7243 (TAK-243)&#xD;
      administered intravenously in a once-weekly schedule in patients with AML or patients with&#xD;
      MDS or CMML refractory to HMAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, followed by a dose expansion, study. Patients are&#xD;
      assigned to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Patients receive UAE inhibitor TAK-243 intravenously (IV) over 10 minutes on days 1,&#xD;
      4, 8, and 11. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 12 months in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Patients receive UAE inhibitor TAK-243 IV over 10 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.&#xD;

             criteria will be considered eligible:&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Absence of other malignancy requiring active therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absence of any co-morbid condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might&#xD;
             compromise the patient's safety, might interfere with participation in the trial or&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Absence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following allogeneic&#xD;
             transplantation; does not require continued treatment with systemic immunosuppressive&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Female patients who:&#xD;

                  screening visit, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Are surgically sterile (i.e., who had undergone hysterectomy or bilateral&#xD;
                  oophorectomy), OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        If they are of childbearing potential:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agree to practice 1 highly effective method and 1 additional effective (barrier)&#xD;
             method of contraception, at the same time, from the time of signing the informed&#xD;
             consent through 4 months after the last dose of study drug (female and male condoms&#xD;
             should not be used together), or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual&#xD;
             lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
             symptothermal, postovulation methods] withdrawal, spermicides only, and lactational&#xD;
             amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of contraception.)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male patients, even if surgically sterilized (i.e., status postvasectomy), who:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment&#xD;
             period and through 4 months after the last dose of study drug (female and male condoms&#xD;
             should not be used together), or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual&#xD;
             lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
             symptothermal, postovulation methods for the female partner] withdrawal, spermicides&#xD;
             only, and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of contraception.)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The effects of MLN7243 (TAK-243) on the developing human fetus are unknown. For&#xD;
                  this reason and because ubiquitin-activating enzyme inhibitors are known to be&#xD;
                  teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
                  contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to&#xD;
                  study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become&#xD;
                  pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in&#xD;
                  this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or&#xD;
                  enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to&#xD;
                  the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion&#xD;

                  imaging (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or computed tomography [CT] scan)&#xD;
                  during the screening period. Patient should be on stable steroid doses and should&#xD;
                  be taking an anti-seizure medication that does not cause drug-drug interactions.&#xD;
                  Patients with a history of CNS disease (leukemia) at diagnosis who have no&#xD;
                  current CNS symptoms would also be eligible. Patients with new or progressive&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  progression to AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  failure to respond to HMA therapy.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy&#xD;
             (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1).&#xD;

             contributing to the metabolism of MLN7243 (TAK-243). Because the lists of these agents&#xD;
             are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated&#xD;
             medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient&#xD;
             will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new&#xD;
             medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new&#xD;
             over-the-counter medicine or herbal product.&#xD;

             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and lactating/breast-feeding women are excluded from this study because&#xD;
             MLN7243 (TAK-243) is a UAE-inhibiting agent with the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects and there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in&#xD;
             nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with MLN7243 (TAK-243). Females&#xD;
             of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days&#xD;
             before enrollment and should not be lactating/breast-feeding. Breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with MLN7243 (TAK-243).&#xD;

             not permitted during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant arrhythmia:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of polymorphic ventricular fibrillation or torsade de pointes,&#xD;
