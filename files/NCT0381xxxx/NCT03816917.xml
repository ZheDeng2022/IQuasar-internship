    <textblock>
      Rationale: Psoriasis (PsO) is a common inflammatory skin disease. Besides the skin, it is&#xD;
      recognized that this disease can affect multiple domains such as nails, joints and entheses.&#xD;
      About 30% of the patients with PsO will develop symptoms in the musculoskeletal domains.&#xD;
      Untreated inflammation in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) can lead to irreversible joint damage and&#xD;
      further reduces quality of life. Since musculoskeletal involvement is often preceded by the&#xD;
      dermatological symptoms of PsO, patients with pure cutaneous psoriasis (PsC) should be&#xD;
      routinely screened for joint involvement. Current screening questionnaires, like the often&#xD;
      used Psoriasis Epidemiology Screening Tool (PEST), offer a moderate discrimination between&#xD;
      patients with PsA and PsC at best. Our aim is to assert the prevalence of known and&#xD;
      previously undiagnosed PsA in a PsC cohort. By comparing the gathered data of the PsA and PsC&#xD;
      patients, we hope to improve the screening of PsC patients, and to reduce both undertreatment&#xD;
      of locomotor symptoms as well as unnecessary diagnostic investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To ascertain the prevalence of PsA in a tertiary PsO cohort. Secondary objectives&#xD;
      will be to ascertain the clinical features of these patients. With these features we want to&#xD;
      find clinical, laboratory or genetic markers to predict the presence of PsA in PsO patients.&#xD;
      Moreover, we wish to establish the added value of PsA screening for the quality of life (QoL)&#xD;
      of PsO patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Multicenter cross-sectional study with a single follow-up visit after 1 year.&#xD;
      Patients will be screened at baseline for PsA symptoms by a rheumatology resident and&#xD;
      referred to a rheumatology clinic if deemed necessary. At baseline, several clinical and&#xD;
      sociodemographic parameters will be assessed. We will collect blood samples for diverse&#xD;
      biochemical studies and genomic DNA. Patients will be followed for 1 year after active&#xD;
      screening for PsA. Quality of life (QoL) and treatment change will be recorded after this&#xD;
      period, to assess the effect of screening and referral.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a monocenter cohort study, which will span at least 1 year from inclusion to&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample of 300 patients known with PsC (cutaneous psoriasis) at the Department of&#xD;
      Dermatology of the RadboudUMC, Nijmegen will be included. Inclusion of patients and&#xD;
      collection of samples will be performed adjacent to their regular outpatient visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During screening, patients will be assessed for signs and symptoms of PsA (psoriatic&#xD;
      arthritis). This will include a 68 tender joint count (TJC) and 66 swollen joint count (SJC),&#xD;
      a dactylitis count, the Leeds enthesis index (LEI) and a questionnaire screening for&#xD;
      inflammatory back pain (IBP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline visit, different parameters will be noted which can later be used to construct&#xD;
      the prediction model. These will include sociodemographic data, relevant comorbidity, family&#xD;
      history, characteristics of the PsC, intoxications, and constitutional and specific&#xD;
      rheumatological signs and symptoms. During physical examination, the investigators will&#xD;
      gather information about body measurements, skin and nail parameters, and rheumatological&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, a screening questionnaires already in use (PEST) will be used, as well as a quality of&#xD;
      life scores (PsAID12, DLQI, Short-Form 12 Health Survey/SF-12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be drawn at baseline to check for different laboratory parameters which are&#xD;
      associated with presence of PsA. Both inflammatory markers (e.g. cytokines, chemokines) as&#xD;
      markers associated with bone metabolism are of interest. Also, DNA will be gathered via&#xD;
      saliva and stored. At a later moment, this will be used to investigate the predictive value&#xD;
      of different associated genetic polymorphisms and HLA-associations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there is a clinical suspicion of PsA in the clinical exam, the patient will be referred to&#xD;
      the Department of Rheumatology of the Sint Maartenskliniek, Nijmegen (SMK). From there on,&#xD;
      they will be included in PsA regular care. After 1 year, patient files of the referred&#xD;
      patients will be checked to confirm the diagnosis. Also, treatment changes and their effect&#xD;
      will be noted. This will include both clinical parameters of the PsA and QoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients already treated for PsA at a different clinic will not be referred to the SMK. They&#xD;
      will be asked for permission to retrieve treatment-related data from their treating&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients without musculoskeletal involvement will be re-evaluated after 1 year. Again,&#xD;
      treatment changes and quality of life will be monitored.&#xD;
