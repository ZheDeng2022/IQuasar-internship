      Background: Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has become a standard intraoperative&#xD;
      diagnosis technique for clinical management of patients during cardiac and non-cardiac&#xD;
      surgery. Accurate intraoperative diagnosis by TEE improves as image quality improves.&#xD;
      Although we recently reported enhanced image quality using a TEE probe with an attached&#xD;
      orogastric tube, its clinical significance is still unknown. Also, we are concerned about&#xD;
      potential clinical complications including damage to the upper gastrointestinal tract due to&#xD;
      its rough surface. Therefore, we devised a new TEE probe cover equipped with a suction&#xD;
      catheter and ultrasound gel containing pad that functions as a cushion for preventing&#xD;
      surrounding tissue trauma. Our long-term goal is to improve TEE image quality, which will&#xD;
      help surgical decision-making with precise assessment. The study population will be elective&#xD;
      cardiac cases and liver transplant cases at Henry Ford Hospital. The objective of this grant&#xD;
      is to assess the image quality change with our newly designed TEE probe, and its clinical&#xD;
      utility on patient care in different types of procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. To assess TEE image quality before and after pin-point suctioning with our newly&#xD;
      designed TEE probe. We hypothesize that decreasing stomach air between the TEE probe&#xD;
      transducer and tissue wall by pin-point suction with our newly designed TEE probe will reduce&#xD;
      ultrasound reflection and lead to better image quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To evaluate the clinical utility of our newly designed TEE probe cover. We hypothesize&#xD;
      our newly designed TEE probe cover will facilitate decision-making for both anesthesiologists&#xD;
      and surgeons and it will not increase the occurrence of TEE probe related trauma.&#xD;
