  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open label, multicentric proof-of-concept, phase II study in patients&#xD;
      with EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with acquired TKI resistance who are&#xD;
      &quot;unknown&quot; for EGFR T790M status due to non-informative or unfeasible tumor rebiopsy, and a&#xD;
      negative finding for EGFR T790M in a standard plasma genotyping assay. All patients will&#xD;
      receive osimertinib as continuous oral treatment for one cycle (28 days). Patients who&#xD;
      demonstrate a metabolic response by FDG-PET scanning (to be conducted between day 15 and day&#xD;
      28 of cycle 1) will continue treatment until clinical or radiological progression.&#xD;
      Osimertinib treatment will be terminated in patients not experiencing a metabolic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the rate of early metabolic responses to osimertinib in patients with EGFR-mutated&#xD;
      NSCLC and acquired TKI resistance who are &quot;unknown&quot; for EGFR T790M status due to&#xD;
      non-informative or unfeasible tumor rebiopsy, and a negative finding for EGFR T790M in a&#xD;
      standard plasma genotyping assay.&#xD;
