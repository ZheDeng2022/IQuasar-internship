               1. Inclusion criteria: RPTR-147:1 (Arms A &amp; B) treatment groups&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Cohort enrollment may be limited to potentially immune-responsive tumor types&#xD;
                  meeting the above criterion during the first approximately 2 weeks of the&#xD;
                  enrollment period of each cohort due to their potential to respond to and&#xD;
                  activate RPTR-147:1:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  NSCLC&#xD;

                       Committee meetings, the patient population may be further limited based&#xD;
                       other factors&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Inclusion criteria: RPTR-147:2 (Arm C) treatment group Patients with cancers&#xD;
                  known to be HPV-16 positive. Please see Section 7.1.1 and Section 7.2.4 for more&#xD;
                  information.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient must have documented HLA-typing results that meet the study requirements. The&#xD;
             list of eligible HLA alleles will be updated on an ongoing basis by the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
             • Once sufficient data has been collected for drug product analytics, or sufficient&#xD;
             HLA coverage is obtained, the HLA-type eligibility requirement may be discontinued by&#xD;
             the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. For patients with solid tumors, use Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor&#xD;
             (RECIST) v1.1: measurable disease (at least one measurable non-nodal lesion of at&#xD;
             least 1.0 cm in longest diameter or nodal lesion of at least 1.5 cm in shortest&#xD;
             diameter) documented within 10 weeks of their projected C1D1 visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
             For patients with lymphoma, use the Lugano classification: measurable disease defined&#xD;
             as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least two dimensions with&#xD;
             spiral computed tomography (CT) scan documented within 10 weeks of their projected&#xD;
             C1D1 visit. Minimum measurement must be &gt;15 mm in the longest diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
             NOTE: If there are no pre-existing radiologic assessments within 10 weeks of the&#xD;
             projected C1D1 visit, other evidence of measurable disease may be considered&#xD;
             sufficient to fulfill this criterion following documented discussion and approval from&#xD;
             the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
             NOTE: Please note, per Section 5.4, for dosing/Screening Period 2, patients must have&#xD;
             a radiological assessment per mRECIST v1.1 (solid tumor) or Lugano classification&#xD;
             (lymphomas) within 28 days before receiving treatment with RPTR-147 to serve as the&#xD;
             patient's baseline tumor assessment.&#xD;

             biopsy, during screening period 2, of a tumor lesion not previously irradiated.&#xD;
             Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks are preferred to slides. Newly&#xD;
             obtained biopsies are preferred to archived tissue. Further details can be found in&#xD;
             the Laboratory Manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: If submitting unstained cut slides, newly cut slides should be submitted to the&#xD;
             testing laboratory within 14 days from the date slides are cut.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. RPTR-147:1 in combination with pembrolizumab (Arm B only) - Patients should have&#xD;
             malignancies for which the response rate to anti-PD1/PDL1 monotherapy is &lt;20% or, if&#xD;
             they have malignancies for which anti-PD1/PDL1 are standard of care must have&#xD;
             progressed on treatment with an anti-PD1/L1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) administered&#xD;
             either as monotherapy, or in combination with other checkpoint inhibitors or other&#xD;
             therapies. PD-1 treatment progression is defined by meeting all of the following&#xD;
             criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Has received at least 2 doses of an approved anti-PD-1/L1 mAb.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Has demonstrated disease progression (PD) after PD-1/L1 as defined by RECIST&#xD;
                  v1.1. The initial evidence of PD is to be confirmed by a second assessment no&#xD;
                  less than four weeks from the date of the first documented PD, in the absence of&#xD;
                  rapid clinical progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Progressive disease has been documented as per the following within 12 weeks from&#xD;

             investigator. Once PD is confirmed, the initial date of PD documentation will be&#xD;
             considered the date of disease progression.)&#xD;
