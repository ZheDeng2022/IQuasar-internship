  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persistent pain and chronic fatigue are very common complaints in rheumatoid arthritis (RA)&#xD;
      patients, whatever the anti-inflammatory treatment response. Interestingly, pain remaining&#xD;
      despite good clinical response was associated with high disability and low inflammation at&#xD;
      baseline, suggesting a mechanism of pain independent of inflammation in these patients. Such&#xD;
      patients, with discordantly high patient-reported DAS28 components, fatigue and mood&#xD;
      disturbance might represent a subgroup of RA patients who have specific clinical needs, not&#xD;
      resolved by classical conventional or biologic DMARDs. In this way, neuropathic pain and pain&#xD;
      sensitization have been demonstrated in 20 to 30% of RA patients, neuropathic pain scores&#xD;
      being associated with worsen disease activity scores. Thus, pain sensitization may contribute&#xD;
      to amplification of pain in active RA, and should be responsible for persisting pain and&#xD;
      fatigue even after inflammation has resolved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain sensitization is associated with neuroplastic changes in sensory pathways at peripheral&#xD;
      and central levels. Interestingly, major mediators responsible for this neuroplasticity&#xD;
      operate via a JAK/STAT signaling pathway, which is specifically targeted by new RA&#xD;
      treatments. New drug targeting JAK/STAT signalling pathway have been recently designed for RA&#xD;
      treatment, based on the implication of this pathway on the signaling of various cytokines&#xD;
      implicated in the pathophysiology of RA, such as IL-6, IL-12, IL-23 and IFNs. Two&#xD;
      Jak-inhibitors have been put on the market: Tofacitinib and Baricitinib. In randomized&#xD;
      clinical trials, Tofacitinib have shown a remarkable efficacy on pain and other patient&#xD;
      reported outcomes, suggesting a specific effect or jak-inhibitors on pain control. Recent&#xD;
      data suggest that Jak-inhibitors could have a direct effect on sensory neurons.&#xD;
