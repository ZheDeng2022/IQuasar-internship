    <textblock>
      This study will be a single-center, single blind, randomized controlled trial. The study will&#xD;
      be conducted at UnityPoint-Health Meriter Hospital under investigators from the University of&#xD;
      Wisconsin-Madison. Obstetric patients with prepregnancy obesity undergoing a Cesarean&#xD;
      delivery at UnityPoint-Health Meriter will be eligible.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether transdermal lidocaine administered at the&#xD;
      time of Cesarean delivery and for 12 hours postoperatively will reduce the total dose of&#xD;
      opioids received. Our hypothesis is that a lidocaine patch will reduce the total dose of&#xD;
      opioids received in the immediate 24 hours post-delivery. Secondary outcomes will include&#xD;
      patient self-reported pain scores, patient-reported incidence of side effects, such as&#xD;
      pruritis, development of objective complications, such as serious skin reactions (examples&#xD;
      are acute generalized exanthematous pustolosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal&#xD;
      necrolysis), hypersensitivity, nausea, and nervousness. Other outcomes collected will include&#xD;
      length of stay, time to first rescue analgesic medication, total dose of opioids in 48 hours,&#xD;
      use of supplemental oxygen during hospitalization, total dose of opioids during&#xD;
      hospitalization, breastfeeding rates, both exclusive and in combination with formula use,&#xD;
      amount of opioid prescribed at discharge and whether refills were requested or administered,&#xD;
      rates of chronic pain at six weeks postpartum, and six week Edinburgh Depression Screen&#xD;
      scores. Neonatal outcomes such as five-minute Apgar scores and development of adverse&#xD;
      outcomes will also be collected.&#xD;

    <measure>Total Dose of Opioids Received in the First 24 Hours Following Cesarean</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The total dose of opioids received in the first 24 hours following Cesarean delivery measured as oral morphine equivalents. This total dose will be calculated for every subject in the study, and the average and standard deviation (or appropriate non-parametric values if the data is not normally distributed) will be compared between the subjects randomized to the intervention arm and the placebo arm of the study.</description>

    <measure>Post-operative Pain Score at 24 Hours Post-operatively</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The post-operative pain score at 24 hours post-operatively will be measured using the numeric rating scale (NRS), wherein subjects rate pain on a 0-10 scale (10 meaning the most pain and 0 meaning no pain). The median NRS score at 24 hours will be compared between the two groups.</description>
