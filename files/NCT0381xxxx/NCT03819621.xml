  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the degree of translational movement loss from orbital implant to&#xD;
      ocular prosthesis. This will be measured using two software applications - Image J as well as&#xD;
      the mediGrid smartphone app in measuring prosthesis motility by comparing it to the ruler as&#xD;
      a &quot;gold&quot; standard.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The fit and function of an ocular prosthetic determines the effective motility (movement)&#xD;
      within the patient's eye socket. A poor fitting ocular prosthesis will lead to poor motility,&#xD;
      patient discomfort and increased mucus discharge, and can risk the integrity of the anterior&#xD;
      surface of the implanted orbit. Currently the method to determine best fit of the ocular&#xD;
      prosthesis is dependent upon the ocularist's skill in adding or subtracting material from the&#xD;
      wax model that is replicated from an initial alginate impression of the patient's eye socket.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposal of this study is to utilise digital imaging to capture images to measure the&#xD;
      motility of both the orbital implant and the ocular prosthesis. Two methods will be compared:&#xD;
      excursion measurements on a photograph using digital software (Image J) versus use of a smart&#xD;
      phone app (an iOS app known as mediGrid (IRISS Medical Technologies, UK; CE Marked, HIPAA&#xD;
      compliant). This study will evaluate the degree of translational movement loss from orbital&#xD;
      implant to ocular prosthesis and analysis will include comparisons between hydroxyapatite and&#xD;
      acrylic implants and in patients without an orbital implant, also known as post-enucleation&#xD;
      socket syndrome (PESS). A part of this study will also evaluate the accuracy of the two&#xD;
      softwares Image J as well as the mediGrid smartphone app in measuring prosthesis motility by&#xD;
      comparing it to the ruler as a &quot;gold&quot; standard.&#xD;
