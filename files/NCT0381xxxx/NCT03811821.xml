      Patients with severe fecal incontinence (FI), defined as two or more episodes of staining,&#xD;
      solid or liquid FI per week, and who meet the inclusion criteria for Injection of Solesta&#xD;
      (INJ; an inert bulking agent), or Biofeedback (BIO) will be enrolled. The baseline rate of FI&#xD;
      will be assessed using a 2-week daily stool diary. All participants will initially be&#xD;
      enrolled into a 4-week trial of Enhanced Medical Management (EMM; education, pelvic floor&#xD;
      exercises, and use of non-prescription drugs to normalize stool consistency). Those who&#xD;
      demonstrate at least a 75% reduction in FI frequency will not be randomized to one of the two&#xD;
      treatment groups but will be followed-up for two years. Those not showing a 75% reduction in&#xD;
      FI frequency will be randomized to BIO or INJ and will be evaluated three months later with&#xD;
      respect to efficacy for reducing the frequency of fecal incontinence, safety of the&#xD;
      interventions, and cost of providing care. All participants who experience a 75% decrease in&#xD;
      FI after three months of treatment, compared to baseline, will be followed-up for a further&#xD;
      21 months, for a total of 24 months from the time of treatment initiation. To assess the&#xD;
      long-term response to treatment, those who improve less than 75% in FI episodes will be&#xD;
      offered an additional treatment with either the treatment to which they were not randomized&#xD;
      or sacral nerve stimulation (SNS). Anorectal manometry and Magnetic Evoked Potentials will be&#xD;
      used to subtype the physiological basis for FI. Quality of life and psychological factors&#xD;
      will be used to assess outcomes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an unmasked, multisite, randomized, parallel group study comparing the effectiveness&#xD;
      of two treatments [BIO and INJ] for moderate to severe FI:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline: Participants will keep a daily symptom diary for two weeks to (a) document&#xD;
           that they meet the minimum frequency required for inclusion in the study and (b) provide&#xD;
           a reference value for assessing treatment response at the end of EMM and at 3, 6, 12,&#xD;
           and 24 months follow-up points.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. EMM: All participants meeting inclusion criteria will first be treated with EMM for 4&#xD;
           weeks. The key components of treatment are patient education about the basic&#xD;
           physiological mechanisms for defecation, diet and medication to normalize stool&#xD;
           consistency, and pelvic floor exercises taught by printed instructions. Additional goals&#xD;
           of the EMM protocol are (a) to ensure that participants randomized to BIO or INJ meet&#xD;
           the accepted criteria for these treatments by failing to respond to EMM, and (b) to&#xD;
           document the efficacy and the durability of systematically applied, optimized EMM.&#xD;
           Patients who are responders to EMM will be followed up 3 months later; those who remain&#xD;
           responders will be continued on EMM and followed for the remaining 24 months of the&#xD;
           study. However, those who are no longer responders to this conservative treatment after&#xD;
           3 months will be invited to be randomized to BIO or INJ and all outcome measures will be&#xD;
           assessed at 3 months from initiation of the treatment arm to which they are randomized.&#xD;
           They will be pooled with other patients randomly assigned to the same treatment for the&#xD;
           primary analyses and will be assessed at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Randomly assigned treatment: Each participant who fails the EMM will be randomly&#xD;
           assigned to BIO or INJ and treated as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  BIO will consist of 5-6 one-hour training sessions spaced at weekly intervals.&#xD;
                These will occur in the first 5-6 weeks of treatment. Treatment approaches will&#xD;
                include strength training in all participants, sensory training for participants&#xD;
                with hyposensitivity, and/or urge-resistance training for participants with&#xD;
                hypersensitivity to the sensations caused by rectal distention. Home exercises will&#xD;
                be assigned to participants to practice these skills, and these will be guided by a&#xD;
                brochure.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  INJ will include a preparation for treatment and a treatment visit. The preparation&#xD;
                will involve prophylactic antibiotics for the day of the procedure and minimal&#xD;
                restrictions on food intake. On the day of the procedure, a physician will inject 1&#xD;
                ml of dextranomer into each of 4 quadrants of the rectum proximal to the dentate&#xD;
                line. Ten seconds will be allowed to pass before the injection needle is withdrawn&#xD;
                to minimize drainage of the dextranomer. The participant will be scheduled to&#xD;
                return in 6 weeks for possible repeat injection of a second 4 ml of dextranomer. At&#xD;
                this second appointment, if FI has improved by 75% or more compared to baseline,&#xD;
                the participant will be continued without a second injection. However, if the rate&#xD;
                of FI is greater than 75% of baseline, the participant will be offered a second&#xD;
                injection of dextranomer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Combination therapy: The primary assessment of efficacy is at 3 months following the&#xD;
           first treatment visit completed, and participants who have not achieved at least a 75%&#xD;
           reduction in FI frequency compared to baseline will be classified as treatment failures;&#xD;
           they will be invited to choose the treatment to which they were not randomized or SNS as&#xD;
           an adjunctive treatment for the remaining months of the study. One reason for this is to&#xD;
           increase the likelihood that participant will consent to be randomized despite possibly&#xD;
           having a priori preferences for one of the two treatments. Thus, the participants who&#xD;
           add a second treatment and continue to be monitored up to 24 months will constitute a&#xD;
           pragmatic clinical trial (i.e., the study design for these participants going forward&#xD;
           emulates the clinical situation in which patients who have an unsatisfactory response to&#xD;
           a treatment are offered a new treatment or an ancillary treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Long-term follow-up: An intention-to-treat analysis of efficacy will be carried out at&#xD;
           6, 12 and 24 months. For these analyses, all participants randomized to treatment will&#xD;
           be included in the analysis. All treatments will continue to be active. The bulking&#xD;
           agents injected in the INJ treatment will remain in place. For BIO, participants will be&#xD;
           encouraged to continue to practice pelvic floor exercises and enhanced awareness of&#xD;
           rectal sensations following the initial training period. Participants who withdraw from&#xD;
           the study or who fail treatment at 3 months will be evaluated as treatment failures in&#xD;
           follow-up analyses of efficacy. Data will be collected from participants who add an&#xD;
           alternative treatment at 3 months, but these data will not be considered in this&#xD;
           analysis. Safety data will be collected at every visit. Participants who are responders&#xD;
           at 3 months will continue to monitor symptoms for an additional 21 months (2 years&#xD;
           total) whereas participants who are non-responders at 3 months will be retained as&#xD;
           treatment failures in the long-term analysis of the comparative effectiveness of the BIO&#xD;
           and INJ treatments. For longitudinal assessments of safety, cost, and secondary outcomes&#xD;
           such as quality of life and FI severity scales, statistical models will include data&#xD;
           from follow up time points through 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Adjust for Expectation of Benefit: In a trial comparing behavioral and medical therapy,&#xD;
           participants cannot be masked. The validated Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire was&#xD;
           developed to assess the patient's expectation of benefit after initial exposure to&#xD;
           treatment and was used in previous studies to determine whether there is equipoise&#xD;
           between the active and control conditions in behavioral treatment trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Characterization of Enhanced Medical Treatment - Durability of improvement and&#xD;
           predictors of response: The primary purpose of treating all participants with an EMM&#xD;
           run-in is to be able to exclude participants who do not require more costly&#xD;
           interventions. However, the investigators will take advantage of the opportunity&#xD;
           provided by this run-in study to identify predictors of response to EMM and to assess&#xD;
           the durability of improvements. EMM will not be &quot;usual care&quot; but will follow a written&#xD;
           protocol that is intended to optimize EMM, which is why this is labelled enhanced&#xD;
           medical management. Participants who are treatment responders at the end of the EMM&#xD;
           run-in will be scheduled for 3-month follow-up, and those who are no longer treatment&#xD;
           responders at 3 months follow-up will be offered an opportunity to be randomized to one&#xD;
           of the 3 treatments at this point. However, those who remain responders to EMM at 3&#xD;
           months follow-up will continue to be followed for an additional 21 months. All&#xD;
           participants, regardless of their outcomes at the end of EMM, will be encouraged to&#xD;
           continue using the treatment approaches learned during the EMM phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be studied for 24-27 months after completing the month of EMM and the&#xD;
      anticipated duration of the study is 4.5 years from first enrollment to completion of the&#xD;
      last participant. Approximately 285 adult participants, both male and female, will be&#xD;
      recruited for EMM to ensure that 194 participants who did not benefit from EMM will be&#xD;
      available for randomization to the two treatment arms (97 per treatment arm). The&#xD;
      participants may be referred by clinicians or may respond to posted advertisements about the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
