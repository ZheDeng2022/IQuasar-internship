  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal will evaluate the glucocorticoid mediated changes in body fat distribution and&#xD;
      metabolism that occur in patients with Cushing's disease. The objective is to identify the&#xD;
      mechanisms that influence both the accumulation of lipodystrophic fat and also the changes in&#xD;
      energy expenditure and metabolism that accompany them. The study is designed to determine if&#xD;
      the high cortisol and AgRP levels in the blood of people living with Cushing's syndrome,&#xD;
      either from taking steroid medications or from tumors, impact body fat and metabolism by&#xD;
      turning off brown fat, which is a type of fat that increases one's metabolism.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cushing's disease (CD) is a disorder of chronic glucocorticoid (GC) excess that gives rise to&#xD;
      a constellation of metabolic comorbidities and to a distinct lipodystrophic body habitus&#xD;
      characterized by central adiposity, extremity wasting, and the accumulation of&#xD;
      supraclavicular (SC) and dorsocervical (DC) fat in the region where human brown and beige&#xD;
      adipose tissue is known to be concentrated. In spite of the recognized thermogenic capacity&#xD;
      of select cervical adipocytes, the potential impact of lipomatous alterations in this depot&#xD;
      on energy balance and metabolism in CD is unknown. To our knowledge, the &quot;buffalo hump&quot; and&#xD;
      the supraclavicular fat pads - which are a sensitive physical finding for CD, have never been&#xD;
      phenotypically characterized and the mechanisms underlying the GC mediated development of fat&#xD;
      in these depots and the associated metabolic complications have not been explored in humans.&#xD;
      The proposed research will advance our understanding of Cushing's lipodystrophy and its&#xD;
      metabolic complications. Furthermore, it may lead to the identification of novel mediators&#xD;
      and targetable pathways to attenuate the adverse effects of hypercortisolism on body&#xD;
      composition and metabolism in CD, as well as in the significant population of patients&#xD;
      treated with chronic GCs for an array of other clinical conditions. These findings may have&#xD;
      important implications not only for those with Cushing's disease, but for the millions of&#xD;
      Americans who are treated with chronic glucocorticoids for an array of clinical conditions.&#xD;

      Subjects will undergo 4mm punch biopsies of the SC, DC, and subcutaneous abdominal fat pads&#xD;
      under local anesthesia (lidocaine). Biopsies will be performed by an interventional&#xD;
      radiologist or surgeon. Specimens will be prepared for histologic analysis and for&#xD;
      immunohistochemical analysis for brown and white adipose tissue markers.&#xD;
