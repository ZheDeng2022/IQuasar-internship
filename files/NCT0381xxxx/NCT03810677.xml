    <textblock>
      This study aims to prove that the ELVeS® Radial® 2ring slim fiber is safe and effective in&#xD;
      endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) of varicose veins, with a reliable durability by evaluating&#xD;
      procedural details/outcomes, clinical success, anatomic success, pain, post-operative adverse&#xD;
      events and re-interventions.&#xD;

    <description>The VAS scale contains a 0 - 100 grading with 0 equaling no pain and 100 equaling the worst conceivable pain. The patient is asked to select the number on the scale that corresponds to the worst level of pain he/she experiences. Pain is classified into mild (1 - 30 mm), moderate (31 - 60 mm) and severe (61 - 100 mm). Absence of pain is defined as VAS = 0.</description>
