  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise training as part of Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR) has been shown conclusively to&#xD;
      improve breathlessness,quality of life and exercise capacity for people with COPD. However&#xD;
      generally PR is delivered in a 'one size fits all' approach without considering different&#xD;
      aspects of an individual's disease. It is hypothesised that a more personalised approach to&#xD;
      PR may yield even better results. However to design a personalised programme of PR we need a&#xD;
      better understanding of how different people with COPD respond to different possible exercise&#xD;
      training modalities. This study will therefore comprehensively characterise a group of&#xD;
      patients and then ask them to complete 3 weeks of exercise training in one of four&#xD;
      modalities; conventional cycling, eccentric cycling, one-legged cycling and resistance&#xD;
      training. The aim is not to prove which type of training is more effective but to develop an&#xD;
      idea of which groups of patients would benefit from which type of training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline measures would be designed to fully understand how an individual responds to&#xD;
      exercise and would therefore be comprised of a variety of endurance tests, strength tests,&#xD;
      questionnaires, and measurements of lung capacity and body composition. This is to give as&#xD;
      much information as possible to identify different responses to exercise.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a highly prevalent condition affecting an&#xD;
      estimated 1.2 million people in the UK and is the second most common lung disease after&#xD;
      asthma. COPD not only affect the lungs, but is a systemic disease with muscle dysfunction&#xD;
      being a significant feature. Exercise, as part of a programme of pulmonary rehabilitation&#xD;
      (PR), has been shown to improve exercise capacity and quality of life of patients with COPD.&#xD;
      However, despite the effectiveness of PR at a population level, there remains room for&#xD;
      improvement. The individual treatment response is heterogeneous with some patients failing to&#xD;
      achieve clinically significant improvements, whilst others struggle to adhere to the exercise&#xD;
      component or drop out altogether. Currently, whilst exercise intensities (the &quot;dose&quot;) are&#xD;
      individualised during PR, the character and content of PR is generally provided in a &quot;one&#xD;
      size fits all&quot; manner. There is therefore scope to modify the content of PR to meet&#xD;
      individual needs and underlying physiology thereby enhancing adherence and benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Precision medicine, tailoring therapy to specific &quot;treatable traits&quot; of an individual's&#xD;
      condition, holds the potential to maximise treatment effect whilst minimising adverse&#xD;
      effects. The investigators propose the same principles of precision medicine can be used to&#xD;
      improve the delivery of PR by identifying an individual's exercise response at enrolment to&#xD;
      PR and using this information to personalise exercise training. There are a growing number of&#xD;
      diverse, novel training modalities that have been shown to be feasible and potentially&#xD;
      efficacious in COPD, offering opportunities for delivering a personalised training programme.&#xD;
      A key step in the development of this personalised/precision approach in exercise medicine is&#xD;
      the understanding and measurement of the individual exercise pathophysiology that predicts&#xD;
      preferential benefits to a particular exercise training modality. However, the relationship&#xD;
      between baseline exercise pathophysiology (and indeed other disease and demographic&#xD;
      variables) and such a response is currently unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eccentric exercise, contraction of a muscle as it lengthens, and one-legged cycling are two&#xD;
      options for diversifying PR. For a given muscle workload, eccentric exercise results in lower&#xD;
      energy demand and oxygen consumption and therefore puts less strain on the cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      system. Consequently, this type of exercise may be ideally suited for patients with lung&#xD;
      disease, particularly for those who stop exercise due to ventilatory limitations. It may be&#xD;
      more tolerable for patients as it causes less breathlessness, whilst allowing greater muscle&#xD;
      specific work. Eccentric cycling involves use of a bike with an attached motor which drives&#xD;
      the pedals in reverse. The subject must resist the rotation of the pedals to maintain a&#xD;
      constant pedal speed, thereby performing eccentric work with their legs. Using eccentric&#xD;
      exercise as a training modality had historically been avoided due to the fear of causing&#xD;
      muscle damage. High intensity eccentric resistance exercise leads to delayed onset muscle&#xD;
      soreness (DOMS) and has been used for many years as a model of inducing muscle damage.&#xD;
      However over the last 30 years there have been an increasing number of studies showing&#xD;
      comprehensively that if load is gradually increased, muscle damage and soreness is minimal&#xD;
      and acceptable. In patient populations, because loads achieved are particularly low, the&#xD;
      occurrence of significant muscle damage is even more infrequent and previous work, has&#xD;
      demonstrated that eccentric cycling is well tolerated in patients with COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole body exercise, such as walking or cycling, requires recruitment of a large muscle mass&#xD;
      generating a high oxygen demand. However, there is a disparity between whole body maximal&#xD;
      oxygen uptake and muscle maximum aerobic capacity, even in a healthy population, and&#xD;
      consequently significant variation in the muscle training stimuli achieved. This is&#xD;
      emphasised in patients with COPD with a ventilatory limit to exercise. By exercising a&#xD;
      smaller muscle mass, this ventilatory limitation can be bypassed and the individual muscle&#xD;
      can be worked at significantly higher intensity. One method to reduce the exercising muscle&#xD;
      mass is one-legged cycling. Two randomised controlled trials have demonstrated a greater&#xD;
      improvement in V̇O2peak following one-legged cycling compared with two legged cycling in&#xD;
      patients with COPD. One-legged cycling has been demonstrated to be a feasible addition to a&#xD;
      PR programme and well received by patients and physiotherapists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to determine how disease, demographic and exercise physiological variables&#xD;
      recorded at baseline relate to subsequent perception and progression of novel training&#xD;
      modalities compared to conventional training. The investigators will perform a comprehensive&#xD;
      assessment of physiological response to exercise at baseline in terms of exercise capacity,&#xD;
      exercise limitation, muscle volume and strength, physical activity, frailty and muscle&#xD;
      composition. Participants will then be randomly allocated to one of 4 training modalities;&#xD;
      eccentric cycling, one-legged cycling, concentric (traditional 2-legged cycling), or lower&#xD;
      limb resistance training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot/feasibility study with the broad aim of identifying potential subphenotypes&#xD;
      of patients with COPD that might respond preferentially to particular modalities of training.&#xD;
      This knowledge is crucial to the development of definitive clinical trials of such exercise&#xD;
      medicine interventions that could be delivered in routine clinical practice. The specific&#xD;
      aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To characterise in detail the underlying pulmonary and systemic pathophysiological&#xD;
           characteristics of patients with COPD who are disabled by exercise limitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To measure progression of training loads during each training intervention relative to&#xD;
           baseline values.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine how baseline characteristics and pathophysiology relate to training&#xD;
           progression and exercise experience.&#xD;
