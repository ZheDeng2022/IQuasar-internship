  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this feasibility study the investigators are using a setup of stress-related body sensors&#xD;
      including established as well as innovative sensor-based measures to identify predictor&#xD;
      profiles for alcohol-related behavioral and neural measures in Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD).&#xD;
      Long-term aim is the definition of a setup of mobile sensors and their integration in a&#xD;
      mobile infrastructure that allows the prediction of stress related alcohol intake in an&#xD;
      ambulatory setting.&#xD;

      The long-term aim is the definition of a setup of mobile sensors and their integration in a&#xD;
      mobile infrastructure that allows the prediction of stress related alcohol intake in an&#xD;
      ambulatory setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) stress exposure is known to affect craving,&#xD;
      cue-reactivity and relapse risk. Here, the investigators aim to identify stress- and alcohol&#xD;
      cue-related physiological markers in a lab experiment to assess interactions between acute&#xD;
      psychological stress exposure and alcohol cue-exposure regarding their effects on alcohol&#xD;
      craving and related markers (attentional bias to alcohol-cues, implicit association task,&#xD;
      neural cue-reactivity). In addition to applying established stress-related markers (cortisol&#xD;
      in saliva, heart-rate variability, systolic blood pressure and electrodermal activity), the&#xD;
      investigators will integrate innovative measures currently under investigation (e.g. voice&#xD;
      stress analysis) to identify whether these additional parameters increase the predictive&#xD;
      significance.&#xD;
