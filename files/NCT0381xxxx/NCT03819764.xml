  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether aerobic exercise improves the&#xD;
      participant's ability to recover function in the arm and leg affected by the participant's&#xD;
      stroke. The investigators are also calculating the cost effectiveness of the rehabilitation&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;

      The aims of the study are to determine the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of&#xD;
      combining aerobic exercise training with upper extremity motor task practice to improve motor&#xD;
      recovery following stroke. It is hypothesized that the neurophysiologic impact of aerobic&#xD;
      exercise may augment motor recovery associated with motor task practice. To test this&#xD;
      hypothesize, 60 individuals with chronic stroke will be recruited to participate in this&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial. Following screening and informed consent, all participants will&#xD;
      undergo an exercise stress test to determine response to maximal exertion. Following the&#xD;
      stress test, baseline clinical assessments will be obtained to quantify upper extremity&#xD;
      function, gait, endurance, and self-reported quality of life. Additionally, variables to&#xD;
      determine degree of disability will be obtained. Individuals will be randomized to one of two&#xD;
      interventions: 45 min of forced-rate aerobic exercise paired with 45 min of upper limb&#xD;
      repetitive task practice or two back-to-back 45-minute sessions of upper limb repetitive task&#xD;
      practice. The interventions will occur 3 times per week for 8 weeks. Outcomes assessing motor&#xD;
      function and disability will be repeated at mid-treatment, end of treatment, and at 4 weeks,&#xD;
      6-months and 12-months following end of treatment.&#xD;

    <measure>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS-29)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>A self-reported questionnaire evaluating physical, mental, and social health. T-scores are reported separately for Anxiety, Depression, Fatigue, Sleep Disturbance, Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities, Physical Function, and Pain Interference.&#xD;
A score of 40 is one standard deviation lower than the mean of the reference population.&#xD;
A score of 60 is one standard deviation higher than the mean of the reference population.&#xD;
For PROMIS measures, higher scores equals more of the concept being measured (e.g., more Fatigue, more Physical Function). Thus a score of 60 is one standard deviation above the average referenced population. This could be a desirable or undesirable outcome, depending upon the concept being measured.</description>
