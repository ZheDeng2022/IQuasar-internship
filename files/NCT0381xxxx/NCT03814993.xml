    <textblock>
      Multicenter observational study to determine the long-term tolerability and analgesic&#xD;
      effectiveness of oral tapentadol in patients suffering from severe pain syndromes, refractory&#xD;
      to other strong opioids.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tapentadol, a centrally acting analgesic. It is indicated in Europe &quot;for the relief of&#xD;
      moderate to severe acute pain in adults, which can be adequately managed only with opioid&#xD;
      analgesics&quot; (IR formulation/oral solution) and &quot;for the management of severe chronic pain in&#xD;
      adults, which can be adequately managed only with opioid analgesics&quot; (SR formulation).&#xD;
      Tapentadol is reimbursed in Belgium since May 1, 2018. The reimbursement was obtained through&#xD;
      an article 81 procedure (Chapter IV) which means that the reimbursement is currently&#xD;
      restricted to the time frame of the contract and that during that period certain questions&#xD;
      and uncertainties regarding the use of tapentadol in a Belgian setting need to be answered.&#xD;
      In order to answer the questions raised by the Belgian Healthcare authorities, this study&#xD;
      will be performed evaluating the application of oral tapentadol in routine clinical practice&#xD;
      in Belgium. The study is conceived as a nation-wide multicentre prospective&#xD;
      non-interventional trial. The primary endpoint and secondary endpoints of this study are&#xD;
      guided by the questions that need to be answered during the course of the contract&#xD;
      reimbursement, as established by the Belgian health authorities.&#xD;
