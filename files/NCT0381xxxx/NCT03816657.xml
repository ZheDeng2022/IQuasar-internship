      This retrospective study explores the combination of Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)&#xD;
      expression and Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) as an easy feasible panel to predict&#xD;
      benefit to nivolumab.&#xD;

      We will retrospectively analyze patients with advanced NSCLC who have received at least one&#xD;
      cycle of nivolumab (3mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks) within the early access program (EAP)&#xD;
      or after the drug approval. All patients have been treated with immunotherapy, in second or&#xD;
      further line, in two Italian Institution (the S. Maria delle Croci Hospital in Ravenna and&#xD;
      the S. Maria della Misericordia Hospital in Perugia) between February 2015 and May 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient data and laboratory values will be recorded in an electronic anonymized database and&#xD;
      personally collected by one of the investigators (C.B.). PD-L1 expression will be assessed by&#xD;
      immunoistochemistry (IHC) on available archival tissue samples with clone E1L3N (monoclonal&#xD;
      rabbit; Cell Signaling technology, Danverd, MA) or SP263 (monoclonal rabbit; Ventana Medical&#xD;
      System, Tucson, AZ), in a Ventana automated stainer according to the manufacturer's protocol&#xD;
      and using proprietary reagents. Since a specific PD-L1 level is not mandatory for prescribing&#xD;
      immunotherapy in second or further lines, except for pembrolizumab, we established the PD-L1&#xD;
      positivity as expression on ≥ 1% of tumor cells. To calculate NLR, the absolute neutrophil&#xD;
      count will be divided by the lymphocytes value measured in peripheral blood within 4 weeks&#xD;
      prior to the first infusion of nivolumab. Patients will be dichotomized according to a&#xD;
      pre-specified cutoff value as high (NLR ≥ 3) or low (NLR &lt; 3), since a ratio greater than 3&#xD;
      has been associated with poor outcome in many types of cancer. Patients will be divided in&#xD;
      two cohorts according to combined PD-L1/NLR value: cohort1 with PD-L1 positive and low NLR&#xD;
      and cohort 2 with PD-L1 negative and high NLR. Primary end point will be ORR, calculated as&#xD;
      the percentage of responses among all treated patients. Response to treatment will be&#xD;
      assessed by computed tomography and classified according to RECIST 1.1 criteria [15 Eisenauer&#xD;
      Cancer 2009]. The influence of the combined PD-L1/NLR on overall response rates (ORR), will&#xD;
      be analyzed with univariable logistic regression. Secondary outcome will be OS and PFS,&#xD;
      calculated from the start of nivolumab treatment to death and radiographic or clinical&#xD;
      progression, respectively, with deterioration of performance status classified as disease&#xD;
      progression. We will also examine whether PD-L1, NRL, or combined PD-L1/NRL contribute to the&#xD;
      prediction of OS or PFS, through multi-variable analyses. Since data collected included many&#xD;
      variables, we will perform multivariable models to examine the dependence of OS and PFS on&#xD;
      known prognostic factors: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS)&#xD;
      (0-1 vs. ≥2) and brain involvement at time of initiating nivolumab, smoking history [never&#xD;
      (&lt;100 cigarettes per lifetime) vs. former/current smokers], histology (squamous vs.&#xD;
      non-squamous), molecular profiling for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Kirsten rat&#xD;
      sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (K-RAS) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) when available.&#xD;
      Patients with squamous-cell cancers will be counted as wild type for targetable mutation,&#xD;
      which are considered to be infrequent in this population. The study was approved by the local&#xD;
      Research Ethics Committee.&#xD;
