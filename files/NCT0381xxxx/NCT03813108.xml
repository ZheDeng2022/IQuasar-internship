    <textblock>
      This is an open label, randomized, controlled clinical trial. The primary aim of this project&#xD;
      is to determine the safety and tolerability of NF135.C10 sporozoite immunization under&#xD;
      chemoprophylaxis against homologous and heterologous challenge infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 49 healty volunteers will be allocated to receive either three immunizations with&#xD;
      15 NF135.C10 infected Anopheles mosquitoes (n=30), 3 immunizations with 5 NF135.C10 infected&#xD;
      mosquitoes (n=10) or no immunizations (n=6). Immunizations in cohort A (n=20) will be&#xD;
      performed under mefloquine prophylaxis, spaced 4 weeks apart. In cohort B, volunteers will&#xD;
      not take mefloquine prophylaxis, instead all volunteers will be treated presumptively on day&#xD;
      7 after each immunization with a curative regimen of artemeter/lumefantrine, regardless of&#xD;
      parasitaemia or symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nineteen weeks after the last immunization, all volunteers plus na√Øve controls will be&#xD;
      challenged either by the bites of 5 NF135.C10 (n=36) or 5 NF54 (n=13) infected mosquitoes.&#xD;
      After challenge infection, volunteers will be followed up on an out-patient basis once daily&#xD;
      for qPCR and safety lab measurements from day 6 until day 21 post challenge. All volunteers&#xD;
      will be treated with a curative regimen of atovaquone/proguanil, either at the time of&#xD;
      detection of blood stage parasitemia, or 28 days after challenge infection.&#xD;
