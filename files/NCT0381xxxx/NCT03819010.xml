      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore after 6 months of treatment the ability of palbociclib in combination with&#xD;
      letrozole to induce global molecular changes measured by either the Oncotype DX Breast&#xD;
      Recurrence Score® (the &quot;Assay&quot;) test result at surgery (post-treatment Recurrence Score® (RS)&#xD;
      result), or pathological Complete Response (pCR) in patients with aggressive luminal tumors&#xD;
      (pre-treatment RS result 18-25 or 26-100, and Ki67≥ 20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  To explore the ability of palbociclib in combination with letrozole to induce global&#xD;
           molecular changes measured by post-treatment RS result, in patients with aggressive&#xD;
           luminal tumors (pre-treatment RS result 18-25 and Ki67≥ 20) after 6 months of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the ability of palbociclib in combination with letrozole to induce global&#xD;
           molecular reduction measured by either the post-treatment RS result, and/or Residual&#xD;
           Cancer Burden (RCB), and/or Ki67 in patients with aggressive luminal tumors&#xD;
           (pre-treatment RS result 18-25 or 26-100 and Ki67 ≥ 20) after 6 months of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To verify the ability of palbociclib in combination with letrozole to induce global&#xD;
           molecular reduction (measured as either post-treatment RS≤25 or RCB score of 0-I) in&#xD;
           &gt;35% of patients in cohort B with pre-treatment RS 26-100;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To verify the ability of palbociclib in combination with letrozole to induce increase in&#xD;
           RS result (measured as post-treatment RS 26-100) in &lt;3% of patients in cohort A with&#xD;
           pre-treatment RS 18-25;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the concordance rate between the RCB score (0- I vs. II-III) and the&#xD;

        -  To determine the change in RS result as measured by median absolute value or median&#xD;
           percentage after 6 months of treatment: from pre-treatment RS 18-25 to post-treatment RS&#xD;
           0-17 for patients in cohort A and from pre-treatment RS 26-100 to post-treatment RS≤25&#xD;

           combination with letrozole.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the Maximum Tumor Shrinkage of palbociclib in combination with letrozole.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the rate of breast conserving surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To assess the safety and tolerability of palbociclib in combination with letrozole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A two-stage Simon's statistical design will be used for both cohorts (minimax design in&#xD;
      co-hort B and optimal design in cohort A). A total of 66 patients will be enrolled into this&#xD;
      trial, N=33 patients in cohort with high-risk tumors (Cohort B: pre-treatment RS&gt;25) and N=33&#xD;
      patients in cohort with intermediate-risk tumors (Cohort A: pre-treatment RS18-25).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The accrual goal will be of 26 patients (N=13 patients in each cohort) during the first&#xD;
      stage. The interim analysis has been planned after 15 patients (cohort B) and 9 patients&#xD;
      (cohort A) will be available for biological response evaluation, and in case of positive&#xD;
      findings, the trial will recruit additional 40 patients (N=20 patients in each cohort).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study would be defined as positive at final analysis in the cohort B (pre-treatment&#xD;
           RS&gt;25), if 8 or more than 8 patients with biological signal (post-treatment RS≤25) are&#xD;
           observed (≥28.6%) among 28 evaluable patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study would be defined as positive at final analysis in the cohort A (pre-treatment&#xD;
           RS18-25), if 25 or more than 25 patients with biological stabilization (post-treatment&#xD;
           RS≤25) are observed (≥89.3%) among 28 evaluable patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatment management&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing the informed consent form (ICF) and confirmed pre- eligibility, patients will&#xD;
      be pre-registered in the study. A tissue biopsy from the primary breast cancer has to be&#xD;
      provided at screening and will be used to perform central confirmation of Ki67 levels and HR&#xD;
      status, as well as central assessment of RS. Pre-registered patients can receive up to 4&#xD;
      weeks of letrozole before inclusion; pre-menopausal patients will require to combine it with&#xD;
      a Luteinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone (LHRH) analogue. Patients are eligible to enter one&#xD;
      of the two cohorts according to RS assessment as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort A: patients with pre-treatment RS 18-25;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort B: patients with pre-treatment RS 26-100. Patients with pre-treatment RS 0-17&#xD;
           will be considered not eligible. Patients allocated to the cohort A or B will receive 24&#xD;
           weeks of palbociclib (for 21 days every 4 weeks) in combination with letrozole (once&#xD;
           daily, beginning on day 1 and continuing through day 28 of every 28-day cycle).&#xD;
           Premenopausal women must also be treated with an LHRH analogue during the treatment&#xD;
           phase.&#xD;
