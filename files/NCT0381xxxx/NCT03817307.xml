      This study evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of USPIO enhanced MRI for the detection of lymph&#xD;
      node metastases in head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) using histopathology as a gold&#xD;
      standard.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The presence of lymph node metastases has a large impact on prognosis and treatment in&#xD;
      head-and neck cancer patients and necessitates treatment intensification. Determining lymph&#xD;
      node status, however, is a challenge because up to 20% of patients with a pre-operative&#xD;
      clinically negative neck will have occult metastases in the neck dissection specimen. One&#xD;
      promising technique is USPIO-enhanced MRI, an MR-imaging technique in which ultrasmall&#xD;
      superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) particles are intravenously infused as a contrast agent&#xD;
      in patients 24-36 hours before the MRI examination and has proven to be of value in detecting&#xD;
      lymph node metastases in various types of cancer. The investigators want to validate this&#xD;
      technique in a cohort of head and neck cancer patients who undergo neck dissection surgery.&#xD;
      Histopathology wills serve as the gold standard and the correlation will be made on a&#xD;
      (neck)level-to-level and node-to-node basis. Since the investigators have no experience in&#xD;
      reading USPIO-enhanced MR images of the neck with 3-dimensional iron-sensitive MR sequences,&#xD;
      this study starts with an explorative part and will be followed by the pilot study. The&#xD;
      explorative component aims at obtaining knowledge regarding visual features of&#xD;
      (non-)metastatic cervical lymph nodes on USPIO-enhanced MR images. The purpose is that the&#xD;
      observers work through a learning curve. The information obtained will be used to develop a&#xD;
      scoring system for the radiologic assessment of cervical lymph nodes in the subsequent part&#xD;
      of our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If USPIO-enhanced MRI is successful, this may obviate the need for a sentinel node procedure&#xD;
      for example. Furthermore, it could guide treatment such as the performance of more selective&#xD;
      neck dissections and de-escalation of the radiation dose to healthy tissues in order to&#xD;
      decrease morbidity but maintaining high cure rates.&#xD;
