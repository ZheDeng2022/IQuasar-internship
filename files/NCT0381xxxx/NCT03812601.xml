  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study uses two AcQMap imaging and electroanatomical mapping systems (Acutus Medical) to&#xD;
      simultaneously visualise and map patterns of wavefront propagation in both the left and right&#xD;
      atria during atrial fibrillation in order to identify mechanisms of rhythm propagation and&#xD;
      maintenance and the importance of the interaction of the left and right atria. Mapping will&#xD;
      also be performed during pacing from different sites and cycle lengths to identify regions of&#xD;
      abnormal conduction that may be related to the maintenance of atrial fibrillation.&#xD;

      Patients undergoing first time catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation with undergo&#xD;
      simultaneous bi-atrial mapping using two linked AcQMap imaging and mapping systems from&#xD;
      Acutus Medical. Mapping will be performed during AF, sinus rhythm and pacing (following&#xD;
      cardioversion if required). Pacing will be undertaken from 3 sites in order to create&#xD;
      different vectors of conduction and at varying cycle lengths and coupling intervals in order&#xD;
      to identify regions of slow and anisotropic conduction. Patients will then undergo pulmonary&#xD;
      vein isolation by radiofrequency ablation followed by ablation of non-pulmonary vein targets&#xD;
      at the operators discretion (ablation in line with clinical practice and not as part of the&#xD;
      study). Regions of focal firing, rotational or slow conduction during AF will be noted and&#xD;
      the interaction between each atria described.&#xD;
