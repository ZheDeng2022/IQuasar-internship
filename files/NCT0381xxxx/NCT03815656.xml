    <textblock>
      This study involves patients who are already planning to have deep brain stimulation (DBS)&#xD;
      surgery to treat the symptoms of severe Parkinson's Disease (PD). The study has two goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to evaluate the effectiveness of implanting DBS electrodes in the two most common&#xD;
           locations for DBS (subthalamic nucleus (STN), and globus pallidus interna (GPi)),&#xD;
           instead of just one electrode, on each side of the brain; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to develop an adaptive DBS system using brain signals measured from these two&#xD;
           electrodes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is a small, first in man, clinical feasibility trial for patients&#xD;
      with severe Parkinson's Disease (PD), who are already clinically eligible for deep brain&#xD;
      stimulation (DBS) with two goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to compare efficacy from two common sites of DBS (subthalamic nucleus (STN), and globus&#xD;
           pallidus interna (GPi)) through the implantation of dual DBS electrodes on each side of&#xD;
           the brain; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to develop a closed loop DBS system using evoked and spontaneous potentials derived from&#xD;
           these two electrodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve bilateral dual DBS electrode placement in clinically standard&#xD;
      locations (ie, STN and GPi) unilaterally or (more often) bilaterally, the placement of the&#xD;
      RC+S Medtronic research implantable pulse generator (IPG), and a commitment to return for&#xD;
      both extensive postoperative programming and testing to define clinical efficacy and separate&#xD;
      research days to develop the closed loop approach. In addition, patients will undergo&#xD;
      intraoperative research using temporary percutaneous extensions to the DBS electrode(s) and&#xD;
      DBS lead cannula after implantation to confirm the electrode location and to identify what&#xD;
      the signals will look like during later chronic recordings through the research IPG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research RC+S IPG includes both ordinary DBS stimulation as well as a recording system&#xD;
      that simultaneously measures the DBS local evoked potential (DLEP) and/or local field&#xD;
      potential (LFP) responses from either the same or a second DBS electrode.&#xD;

    <description>UPDRS score for subject in &quot;on&quot; medication and &quot;on&quot; stimulation state. The UPDRS is a scale to measure the degree of a patient's disability due to Parkinson's Disease. The scores from four subscales (1. Mentation, Behavior and Mood, 2. Activities of Daily Living, 3. Motor Examination, and 4. Complications of Therapy) are summed to determine the total UPDRS score. Total scores range from 0 (no disability) to 199 (total disability).</description>

    <description>The PDQ-39 is a 39-item self-reporting questionnaire to assess the impact of Parkinson's Disease on quality of life. The PDQ-39 is divided into 8 dimensions (1. Mobility, 2. Activities of Daily Life, 3. Emotional Well-being, 4. Stigma, 5. Social Support, 6. Cognition, 7. Communication, and 8. Bodily Discomfort). The total score is the sum of the dimension total scores divided by 8. Scores range from 0 (better quality of life) to 100 (worse quality of life).</description>
