  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In vitro fertilization (IVF) is a new expertise of our age. Anesthesia during the assisted&#xD;
      reproduction technique is usually required during oocyte removal, which is one of the basic&#xD;
      steps throughout the entire procedure. Until now, different anesthetic techniques such as&#xD;
      conscious sedation, general anesthesia and regional anesthesia have been tried, no&#xD;
      superiority has been proved against each other. The main point of anesthesia management in&#xD;
      IVF is to minimize anesthesia exposure to avoid harmful effects on embryo division and&#xD;
      fertilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this prospective randomized clinical trial was to compare two different anesthesia&#xD;
      applications (sedation &amp; laryngeal mask airway) on anxiety and patient satisfaction in&#xD;
      patients with IVF.&#xD;

      In vitro fertilization (IVF) is a new expertise of our age. Anesthesia during the assisted&#xD;
      reproduction technique is usually required during oocyte removal, which is one of the basic&#xD;
      steps throughout the entire procedure. Until now, different anesthetic techniques such as&#xD;
      conscious sedation, general anesthesia and regional anesthesia have been tried, no&#xD;
      superiority has been proved against each other. The main point of anesthesia management in&#xD;
      IVF is to minimize anesthesia exposure to avoid harmful effects on embryo division and&#xD;
      fertilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IVF requires the collection of mature oocytes from the ovaries of infertile patients. These&#xD;
      oocytes are then fertilized in vitro and allowed to become embryos. Afterwards, these embryos&#xD;
      are transferred into the uterus of the patients. Ultrasonography-guided transvaginal&#xD;
      aspiration makes oocyte intake less invasive compared to prior techniques and can be&#xD;
      administered within 30 minutes. With the development of this method, trauma was minimalized&#xD;
      and side effects were reduced. However, the possible effects of different anesthetics on&#xD;
      oocytes are still being discussed. The potential side effects of different anesthesia&#xD;
      applications have been observed not only in patients receiving oocytes, but also in embryo&#xD;
      development and pregnancy success due to the quality of oocytes. The pain of patients is&#xD;
      common after the puncture of the vaginal fornix. It is usually defined as deep menstrual&#xD;
      pain, quickly disappears and leaves a mild abdominal pain. Therefore, the anesthetist should&#xD;
      perform adequate pain relief to immobilize the patient to avoid the risk of perforating the&#xD;
      vessels during the procedure. Another challenge for the anesthesiologist is to alleviate the&#xD;
      increased anxiety associated with social and psychological stress associated with IVF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anxiety may develop before and after the procedure, especially in patients undergoing oocyte&#xD;
      collection. The patient's anxiety is usually present before entering the operating room. The&#xD;
      assessment, which was started to be developped by investigators, was aimed to measure state&#xD;
      anxiety levels in normal and non-normal individuals. State-Trait Anxiety Inventory measures&#xD;
      state anxiety levels and is an easy-to-implement inventory that the individual can answer on&#xD;
      his/her own. The State Anxiety Scale determines how the individual feels himself / herself at&#xD;
      a given moment and under certain conditions. It is widely used in preoperative anxiety&#xD;
      measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient satisfaction depends on the patient's expectations and the benefits expected by the&#xD;
      patients with the service they receive. Patient satisfaction is the result of meeting the&#xD;
      wishes and expectations of the patients. An investigator has developed the Recovery Quality&#xD;
      Score-40 (Quality of Recovery Score) and is used to measure the quality of postoperative&#xD;
      recovery. This form consists 40 items and is divided into 5 subgroups according to various&#xD;
      aspects of the improvement. There are a total of 40 items, 9 related to emotional state, 12&#xD;
      related to physical comfort, 7 related to psychological support, 5 related to physical&#xD;
      independence and 7 items related to pain. The questionnaire is scored as a minimum of 40 to a&#xD;
      maximum of 200. No special training is required for the implementation of the survey. The&#xD;
      fact that the patient can perform the survey on his own and can be done in a short time gives&#xD;
      a significant advantage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this prospective randomized clinical trial was to compare two different anesthesia&#xD;
      applications (sedation &amp; laryngeal mask airway) on anxiety and patient satisfaction in&#xD;
      patients with IVF.&#xD;

The State Anxiety Scale determines how the individual feels himself / herself at a given moment and under certain conditions. It is widely used in preoperative anxiety measurement. State-Trait Anxiety Inventory has 40 items, 20 items allocated to each of the State Anxiety and Trait Anxiety subscales. Responses for the State Anxiety scale assess intensity of current feelings &quot;at this moment&quot;: 1) not at all, 2) somewhat, 3) moderately so, and 4) very much so. Responses for the Trait Anxiety scale assess frequency of feelings &quot;in general&quot;: 1) almost never, 2) sometimes, 3) often, and 4) almost always. Range of scores for each subtest is 20-80, the higher score indicating greater anxiety. A cut point of 39-40 has been suggested to detect clinically significant symptoms.</description>

    <description>Quality of Recovery Score is a global measure of quality of recovery. It incorporates five dimensions of health: patient support, comfort, emotions, physical independence, and pain; each item is graded on a five-point Likert scale. Quality of Recovery Scores range from 40 (extremely poor quality of recovery) to 200 (excellent quality of recovery). This consists 40 items and is divided into 5 subgroups according to various aspects of the improvement. There are a total of 40 items, 9 related to emotional state, 12 related to physical comfort, 7 related to psychological support, 5 related to physical independence and 7 items related to pain. The questionnaire is scored as a minimum of 40 to a maximum of 200.</description>
