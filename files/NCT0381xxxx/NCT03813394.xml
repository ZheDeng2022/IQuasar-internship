  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, phase Ib/II open-label study of pembrolizumab (pembro or&#xD;
      MK-3475) with or without bevacizumab in patients with recurrent non-curable or metastatic&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of 2 treatment arms. In Treatment Arm A, patients will be treated with&#xD;
      intravenous pembrolizumab alone, 21-day cycle. For Treatment Arm B, patients will receive&#xD;
      intravenous pembrolizumab preceded by an infusion of bevacizumab (Day 1 of 21-day cycle).&#xD;
      Each treatment cycle is 3 weeks. Up to 48 patients will be enrolled in this study in 2&#xD;
      stages. The first stage will consist of 30 patients and the remaining 18 patients will be&#xD;
      added if interim data looks promising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 into either Treatment Arm A or Arm B. Treatment will&#xD;
      continue until tumor progression, intolerance to treatment, or up to 2 years (32 doses of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab/bevacizumab). For patients who have progressed on pembrolizumab alone, cross&#xD;
      over to Arm B is allowed, with repeat biopsy of the lesions before and 1 week after starting&#xD;
      bevacizumab. Patients who discontinue from the trial will not be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will collect serial samples of tumor tissue and blood to determine the PD&#xD;
      biomarkers of immune activation, in the tumor and systemically, following treatment. This is&#xD;
      expected to provide preliminary evidence for immune stimulation using both pembrolizumab and&#xD;
      bevacizumab in NPC. The tumor biopsies will also present an opportunity to determine the&#xD;
      molecular details of tissue and tumor response to anti-angiogenic therapy.&#xD;

             lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have locally or centrally determined EBV-positive NPC by EBV-encoded small RNA in situ&#xD;
             hybridization (EBER in situ hybridization [ISH]) assay. If EBV-positive status has&#xD;
             been previously determined by EBER ISH assay, then no re-testing is required. Note: If&#xD;
             EBV status by EBER ISH assay has not been previously determined, tumor tissue from&#xD;
             archival tissue may be submitted for EBV determination.&#xD;

             corticosteroids, and not have had radiation pneumonitis. A 1-week washout is permitted&#xD;
             for palliative radiation (≤ 2 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-CNS disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment&#xD;
             within the past 3 years. Note: Participants with basal cell carcinoma of the skin,&#xD;
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, transitional cell carcinoma of urothelial cancer,&#xD;
             or carcinoma in situ (e.g. breast or cervical carcinoma in situ) that have undergone&#xD;
             potentially curative therapy are not excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Has known brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases, whether treated or untreated.&#xD;

             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
