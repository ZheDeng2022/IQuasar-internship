      The plethysmographic variation index (PVi) is a measure of the respiratory-induced variations&#xD;
      in the plethysmographic waveform. Interestingly, in mechanically ventilated patients and&#xD;
      under certain conditions, PVi may reflect fluid responsiveness (FR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients treated with high flow nasal cannula (HFNC), which has been described as a useful&#xD;
      supportive therapy in spontaneously breathing patients with respiratory failure, may present&#xD;
      the same hemodynamic changes, measured by transthoracic echocardiography, as those patients&#xD;
      who are mechanically ventilated (MV). The hypothesis of the present study is that the PVi may&#xD;
      predict FR in HFNC patients and, therefore, the objective is to investigate whether the PVi&#xD;
      can predict FR in patients treated with HFNC.&#xD;

      STUDY BACKGROUND The plethysmographic variation index (PVi) is a measure of the&#xD;
      respiratory-induced variations in the plethysmographic waveform. Interestingly, in&#xD;
      mechanically ventilated patients and under certain conditions, PVi may reflect fluid&#xD;
      responsiveness (FR) (Loupec T Crit Care Med 2011; Sandroni C Intensive Care Med 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) has been described as a useful supportive therapy in&#xD;
      spontaneously breathing patients with respiratory failure (Roca Crit Care 2016), by&#xD;
      increasing lung volume and generating a certain level of airway positive pressure. It has&#xD;
      been shown that patients treated with HFNC may present the same hemodynamic changes, measured&#xD;
      by transthoracic echocardiography, as those patients who are mechanically ventilated (MV)&#xD;
      (Roca J Crit Care 2013). Therefore, PVi may also be useful in HFNC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVE As the hemodynamic changes associated with HFNC use are similar to&#xD;
      those observed in MV patients, the hypothesis of the present study is that PVi may predict FR&#xD;
      in HFNC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to investigate whether the PVi can predict FR in patients treated with HFNC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjects: Patients treated with HFNC presenting with circulatory insufficiency, in whom&#xD;
           volume expansion was planned by the attending physician. Exclusion criteria included&#xD;
           spontaneous respiratory activity, cardiac arrhythmia, known intracardiac shunt, severe&#xD;
           hypoxemia (PaO2/FIO2 &lt;60 mmHg), left ventricular ejection fraction of &lt;50%, hemodynamic&#xD;
           instability during the procedure (defined as the variation in heart rate or blood&#xD;
           pressure of &gt;10% over the 15-min period before starting the protocol) and those with&#xD;
           variations in arterial pulse pressure &lt;13%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Setting: Medico-surgical intensive care unit of a university hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Design: Pilot prospective, observational study&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. At baseline, all patients will be in semirecumbent position with the head at an angle of&#xD;
      45 degrees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Measurements of CO and PVI will be performed in duplicate, before and after a fluid&#xD;
      challenge (8ml/kg of colloids in 10 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. Cardiac output (CO) will be estimated by averaging three consecutive measures obtained&#xD;
      with transthoracic echocardiography (Porter TR. Journal of the American Society of&#xD;
      Echocardiography 2015). The PVi will be measured using Masimo SET® pulse oximetry technology.&#xD;
      The PVi is an automatic measure of the dynamic change in the perfusion index (Pi) that occurs&#xD;
      during the respiratory cycle. The perfusion index (Pi) is the ratio of nonpulsatile to&#xD;
      pulsatile blood flow through the peripheral capillary bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv. The decision to administer fluid was based on the presence of at least one clinical sign&#xD;
      of inadequate tissue perfusion. Clinical signs of inadequate tissue perfusion were suspected&#xD;
      at the bedside by observing hypotension (systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mm Hg or the need for&#xD;
      norepinephrine), oliguria (urine output &lt;0.5 mL/kg/hr), and cool, mottled extremities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      v. Total flow delivered by HFNC and dosages of vasopressive drugs will be kept unchanged&#xD;
      during the entire procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      vi. The HFNC device (Optiflow™ system, MR850 heated humidified RT202 delivery tubing, and&#xD;
      RT050/051 nasal cannula; Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand) consists of a&#xD;
      low resistance nasal cannula that can deliver up to 60L/min of totally conditioned (37ºC and&#xD;
      100% of relative humidity) gas admixture. It is initiated with a minimum flow of 40L/min and&#xD;
      a fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) of 1. Then, FIO2 is set to maintain a pulse oximetry&#xD;
      (SpO2) above 92% and flow rate is set according to the physician's judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      e. Endpoints: Diagnostic accuracy of the PVi (AUROC) for correctly classifying HFNC patients&#xD;
      who would respond to fluid challenge (ΔCO &gt;15%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      f. Data analysis: Changes in hemodynamic measurements induced by fluid challenge will be&#xD;
      assessed by using the nonparametric Wilcoxon's rank sum test for paired data. Patients will&#xD;
      be divided into two groups according to changes ΔCO after fluid challenge. Those presenting a&#xD;
      ΔCO &gt;15% will be considered as responders and the others as nonresponders. Hemodynamic&#xD;
      measurements will be compared using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test for unpaired data. To&#xD;
      assess the accuracy of the PVi for correctly classifying patients who would respond to fluid&#xD;
      challenge, receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) will be performed and the area&#xD;
      under the curves (AUROC) will be calculated. The optimal threshold of continuous variables&#xD;
      will be chosen to maximize the sum of sensitivity and specificity. This is a pilot&#xD;
      observational study that will involve 20 patients.&#xD;
