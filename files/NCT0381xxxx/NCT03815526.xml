    <textblock>
      Injuries to the ankle joint account for 20% of the population that is afﬂicted with joint&#xD;
      injury and the largest percentage of self-reported musculoskeletal injuries (&gt; 10%) are to&#xD;
      the ankle. Ankle sprain has a large portion in ankle injuries and occurs not only in the&#xD;
      sporting population but also in the general community. Although the acute symptom would be&#xD;
      resolve quickly, but many people still report persisting problems, such as pain and&#xD;
      instability. Chronic ankle instability (CAI) is one of the most common of these residual&#xD;
      problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kinesio Tape and White Duck Tape are often applied in patients with CAI, attempt to increase&#xD;
      the ankle joint stability, and improve motor performance. However, the previous studies had&#xD;
      controversial result to the effects of kinesio tape and white duck tape. The previous studies&#xD;
      also showed the insufficient of supporting force and elasticity of kinesio tape and white&#xD;
      duct tape. The Dynamic Tape was developed by Kendrick in 2009, which refined the&#xD;
      characteristic of elasticity and supporting force.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the purpose of study is to comparison the effects of static and dynamic balance&#xD;
      performance, weight shifting ability and functional movement between kinesio tape, white duck&#xD;
      tape and dynamic tape when applied on patients with CAI. With the result may provide an&#xD;
      optical method to increase the movement performance of patients with CAI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study suspected to recruit 90 volunteers with CAI, and randomly divided to three&#xD;
      different groups: Kinesio tape group, White duck tape group and Dynamic tape group. We make&#xD;
      postural stability test and limit postural stability test with Biodex Balance System (SD),&#xD;
      Y-balance test and single leg hop test to both affected side and sound side foot before&#xD;
      applying the tape. After applying the tape according to the divided group, we will repeat the&#xD;
      test above again. We will compare the results of the test between groups and within groups.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A history of at least one signiﬁcant ankle sprain&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The initial sprain must have occurred at least 12 months prior to the study&#xD;
                  enrolment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Was associated with inﬂammatory symptoms (pain, swelling, etc)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Created at least one interrupted day of desired physical activity&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. A history of the previously injured ankle joint 'giving way' , and /or recurrent&#xD;
             sprain and/or 'feelings of instability'.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A history of previous surgeries to the musculoskeletal structures (ie, bones, joint&#xD;
             structures and nerves) in either lower extremity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. A history of a fracture in either lower extremity requiring realignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Acute injury to the musculoskeletal structures of other joints of the lower extremity&#xD;
             in the previous 1 months, which impacted joint integrity and function (ie, sprains,&#xD;
             fractures) resulting in at least 1 interrupted day of desired physical activity.&#xD;
