      The Healing effects of Honey and Hydrogel Products on the Diabetic Foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abstract:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes mellitus epidemiology is increasing dramatically affecting high numbers of the&#xD;
      world's population, one of the highest risk consequences is diabetic foot and which might&#xD;
      lead to leg amputation causing a permanent disability for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies had been conducted on the options available to treat diabetic foot ulcer,&#xD;
      Honey products and Hydrogel stands out as an effective topical treatment for the foot&#xD;
      ulceration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study discusses the effectivity rate of these products and compares it with the&#xD;
      classical methods followed to treat DF using topical and systematic antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence; our research raises the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is the effect of Honey and Hydrogel on the foot anatomy and physiology of DF&#xD;
           patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Could the investigators introduce a new protocol to treat DF using Honey and Hydrogel&#xD;
           products?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aiming to achieve the following objects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To provide a new protocol to improve the anatomy and physiology of DF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the efficacy of combined Hydrogel and Honey products on the diabetic foot&#xD;
           ulcer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reaching there the investigators are expecting to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the healing time between the patients treated with hydrogel/honey products&#xD;
           and the control treatment patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare Lab parameters improvements between the patients treated with hydrogel/honey&#xD;
           products and the control treatment patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare neurological improvements between the patients treated with hydrogel/honey&#xD;
           products and the control treatment patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare the anatomical improvements between the patients treated with hydrogel/honey&#xD;
           products and the control treatment patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to provide a clear estimation for the safety and effectivity profile for each&#xD;
      treatment method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on that the investigators are conducting using single blinded randomized clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suggesting the following Hypothesis: Treatment using topical MediHoney gel and/or Hydrogel&#xD;
      together separately in association with empiric antibiotic regimens have a higher success&#xD;
      rate comparing with treatment using topical and empiric antibiotic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 140 DM patients from Outpatients DM type 2 will be included in this study,&#xD;
      following up at diabetic foot center Al-Qaseem Saudi Arabia. Patients will be divided into 4&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. st group will be treated with topical Medihoney product and empiric antibiotic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. nd group will be treated with topical Hydrogel (purloin) gel and empiric antibiotic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. rd group will be treated with a combination of Medihoney gel and Hydrogel (purloin) gel&#xD;
           and empiric antibiotic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 4th group will be treated with a combination of systematic and topical fucidin 1%&#xD;
      antibiotic this group will be a controlled group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the expected results the investigators are estimating that this study will raise the&#xD;
      awareness of both health care personnel and the diabetic patients about this condition. It is&#xD;
      expected to provide a clear efficacy estimation for each treatment method followed,&#xD;
      facilitating the choice of treatment for physicians.&#xD;

      Introduction Background and rationale 6a Outpatient DM type 2 patients follow up at diabetic&#xD;
      foot centre adult more or equal 18 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - What is the effect honey and hydrogel on the foot anatomy and physiology of DF&#xD;
           patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - Could the investigators introduce a new protocol to treat DF? the investigators find&#xD;
           it very necessary to define the real rate for these two agents treating DF ulcers , to&#xD;
           establish clear clinical evidence supporting the prefer ability of using such natural&#xD;
           low risk and relatively low cost agents in the treatment plan comparing with the use of&#xD;
           the classical antibiotic treatment .&#xD;
&#xD;
      6b &quot;Choice of comparator Effectivity of each product treating DF, the investigators find it&#xD;
      more beneficially to establish a comparative study between such safe and low cost products&#xD;
      and antibiotics recommending a less complicated and safe treatment method using honey and /or&#xD;
      hydrogel rather than depending on the classic antibiotic method with all of its potential&#xD;
      contraindications and restrictions in sensitive group of patients such as DM patients&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives 7 Research hypothesis Treatment using topical MediHoney gel and/or Hydrogel&#xD;

           until the result of culture swab wound appears.&#xD;
&#xD;
           11b Medihoney Gel, Purloin Gel, Fucidin Ointment 1% placebo drug 11c All groups will be&#xD;
           monitored and the prospects for clinical, neurological, and anatomical, improvements&#xD;
           will be followed up by the laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
           11d For 3-12 weeks: Close observation and monitoring the topical treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
           Appearance of ischaemic arterial disease during participation Contraindication Treatment&#xD;
           DFU(Allergic) As well as termination of participant&#xD;
&#xD;
           Outcomes 12 Main Outcome Measurement:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ulcer size • Baseline: Size of the Ulcer before the beginning of treatment • Size will&#xD;
           be monitored upon the commencement of the treatment until reaching the healing&#xD;
           condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Main measurement: Time needed to reach the condition of fully healing of the ulcer&#xD;
           (ULCER SIZE IS ZERO) Participant timeline 13 Dressing patient daily. Measurement of&#xD;
           wound every week. This will continue for 3-12 weeks with DF patients. Sample size 14&#xD;
           Sample size calculation&#xD;

&#xD;
           The sample size formula without the correction factor by Fleiss is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      α: The probability of type I error 5% β: The probability of type II error 20% Zalpha/2=1.96&#xD;
      Zbetta/2=0.842 P0: The proportion of people with control treatment applied in population 1&#xD;

      The ratio of unexposed to exposed 0.33 NFleiss: Required sample size for the population 1&#xD;
      using Fleiss formula According to the equation N Fleiss should be 35 per group patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment 15 Targeted Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our sample size will be 140 patients (due to possibility and cost effectivity) designed as 35&#xD;
      patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Assignment of interventions (for controlled trials)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation: Matching will be done depending on 3 variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gender:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dounis classification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type I Type II Type III (A,B,C)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequence generation 16a Participants will be randomly assigned to either control or&#xD;
      experimental group with a 1:3 allocation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of randomisation: single, blind randomization convenient for all patients follow up in&#xD;
      the DF centre, with matching factors; age, gender, Dounis anatomical classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation concealment mechanism 16b Participants will randomised using central randomisation&#xD;
      service. Allocation concealment will be ensured, as the service will not release the&#xD;
      randomisation code until the patient has been recruited into the trial, which takes place&#xD;
      after all baseline measurements have been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation 16c All patients who give consent for participation and who fulfil the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria will be randomized. Randomisation will be requested by the staff member&#xD;
      responsible for recruitment and clinical interviews from CenTrial [Coordination Centre of&#xD;
      Clinical Trials]. In return, CenTrial will send an answer form to the study therapist who is&#xD;
      not involved in assessing outcome of the study. This form will include a randomisation&#xD;
      number. In every centre closed envelopes with printed randomisation numbers on it are&#xD;
      available. For every randomisation number the corresponding code for the therapy group of the&#xD;
      randomisation list will be found inside the envelopes. The therapist will open the envelope&#xD;
      and will find the treatment condition to be conducted in this patient. The therapist the&#xD;
      gives the information about treatment allocation to the patient. Staff responsible for&#xD;
      recruitment and symptom ratings is not allowed to receive information about the group&#xD;
      allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding (masking) 17a Due to the nature of the intervention, participants can be blinded to&#xD;
      allocation but are strongly inculcated not to disclose the allocation status of the&#xD;
      participant at the follow up assessments. An employee outside the research team will feed&#xD;
      data into the computer in separate datasheets so that the researchers can analyse data&#xD;
      without having access to information about the allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      17b If un-blinding is deemed to be necessary, the investigator should use the system for&#xD;
      emergency un-blinding through the local emergency number as the back-up system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Data collection, management, and analysis Data collection methods 18a Plans for&#xD;
      assessment and collection of outcome, baseline, and other trial data, including any related&#xD;
      processes to promote data quality (eg, duplicate measurements, training of assessors) and a&#xD;
      description of study instruments (eg, questionnaires, laboratory tests) along with their&#xD;
      reliability and validity, if known. Reference to where data collection forms can be found, if&#xD;
      not in the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Outcome Measurement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ulcer size • Baseline: Size of the Ulcer at the before the beginning of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Size will be monitored upon the commencement of the treatment until reaching the healing&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Main measurement: Time needed to reach the condition of fully heal of the ulcer (ULCER SIZE&#xD;
      IS ZERO) Quality Control of the Core Lab Data from the Core Lab will be securely transmitted&#xD;
      in batches and quality controlled in the same manner as Core Coordinating Center Data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      18b Provide written feedback to all patients about the results of the health screening.&#xD;
      Maintain interest in the study through materials and mailing. Send letters to patients prior&#xD;
      to the final data collection, reminding them of the upcoming data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may withdraw from the study for any reason at any time. The investigator also&#xD;
      may withdraw participants from the study in order to protect their safety and/or if they are&#xD;
      unwilling or unable to comply with required study procedures after consultation with the&#xD;
      protocol chair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management 19 Participant files are to be stored in numerical order and stored in a&#xD;
      secure and accessible place and manner. Participant files will be maintained in storage for a&#xD;
      period of 3 years after completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weekly reports with information on missing data, missing forms, and missing visits. Personnel&#xD;
      at the Core Coordinating Center and the Participating Sites should review these reports for&#xD;
      accuracy and report any discrepancies to the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods 20a Statistical methods for analysing primary and secondary outcomes.&#xD;
      Reference to where other details of the statistical analysis plan can be found, if not in the&#xD;
      protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis methods will depend on the improvements according to Dounis classification, as well&#xD;
      as each of the clinical, neurological, anatomical, and angiographic improvement rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20b Methods for any additional analyses (eg, subgroup and adjusted analyses)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be analysed using version 23 of SPSS statistical software (SPSS Inc., Chicago,&#xD;
      IL, USA). Descriptive statistics will be calculated as proportions or as means (with standard&#xD;
      deviations) as appropriate. The significance level will be set as p value&lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20c The investigators propose declaring medical management non-inferior to interventional&#xD;
      therapy, only if shown to be non-inferior using both the &quot;intention to treat&quot; and &quot;per&#xD;
      protocol&quot; analysis sets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Monitoring Data monitoring 21a The DMC is independent of the study organisers.&#xD;
      During the period of recruitment to the study, interim analyses will be supplied, in strict&#xD;
      confidence, to the DMC, together with any other analyses that the committee may request. This&#xD;
      may include analyses of data from other comparable trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      21b An interim-analysis is performed on the primary endpoint when 50% of patients have been&#xD;
      randomised and have completed the 6 months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Harms 22 Adverse events will be collected after the subject has provided consent and enrolled&#xD;
      in the study. If a subject experiences an adverse event after the informed consent document&#xD;
      is signed (entry) but the subject has not started to receive study intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Auditing 23 The quality and completeness of the data will be reflective of the state of the&#xD;
      art in clinical trials. The focus of the visit/electronic monitoring will be on source&#xD;
      document review and confirmation of adverse events. The monitor will verify the following&#xD;
      variables for all patients: initials, date of birth, sex, signed informed consent,&#xD;
      eligibility criteria, date of randomization, treatment assignment, adverse events, and&#xD;
      endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics and dissemination Research ethics approval 24 The protocol, site-specific informed&#xD;
      consent forms (local language and English versions), participant education and recruitment&#xD;
      materials, and other requested documents-and any subsequent modifications - also will be&#xD;
      reviewed and approved by the ethical review bodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigator will make safety and progress reports and summaries review of safety and/or&#xD;
      efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol amendments 25 Any modifications to the protocol which may impact on the conduct of&#xD;
      the study, potential benefit of the patient or may affect patient safety, including changes&#xD;
      of study objectives, study design, patient population, sample sizes, study procedures, or&#xD;
      significant administrative aspects will require a formal amendment to the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent or assent 26a Trained Research Nurses will introduce the trial to patients who will&#xD;
      receive information sheets. Research Nurses will discuss the trial with patients in light of&#xD;
      the information provided in the information sheets. Patients will then be able to have an&#xD;
      informed discussion with the participating consultant. Research Nurses will obtain written&#xD;
      consent from patients willing to participate in the trial. Information sheets and consent&#xD;
      forms are provided for all parents involved in the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      26b A materials consent will be obtained to specifically address the collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality 27 All study-related information will be stored securely at the study site.&#xD;
      All participant information will be stored in locked file cabinets in areas with limited&#xD;
      access. All laboratory specimens, reports, data collection, process, and administrative forms&#xD;
      will be identified by a coded ID [identification] number only to maintain participant&#xD;
      confidentiality. All records that contain names or other personal identifiers, such as&#xD;
      locator forms and informed consent forms, will be stored separately from study records&#xD;
      identified by code number. All local databases will be secured with password-protected access&#xD;
      systems. Forms, lists, logbooks, appointment books, and any other listings that link&#xD;
      participant ID numbers to other identifying information will be stored in a separate, locked&#xD;
      file in an area with limited access.&#xD;
