  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with severe immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) present with similarly low platelet counts&#xD;
      but varying bleeding symptoms, making it difficult to predict the disease course and to&#xD;
      decide on an appropriate treatment plan. In a single-center study, platelet parameters&#xD;
      including the immature platelet fraction, the absolute immature platelet count , and&#xD;
      functional response markers were found to be significantly associated with patient bleeding&#xD;
      severity, independent of platelet count. This study aims to confirm and replicate these&#xD;
      findings in a multi-center patient population and to investigate the use of these parameters&#xD;
      to better predict disease severity and bleeding events.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many children with severe immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) present with mild symptoms and their&#xD;
      disease spontaneously resolves within 3 to 6 months. However, a subset of pediatric ITP&#xD;
      patients experience severe bleeds and their symptoms persist for more than 6 to 12 months.&#xD;
      Both patient populations present with similarly low platelet counts, making it difficult to&#xD;
      predict the disease course and to decide on a treatment plan. The current American Society of&#xD;
      Hematology treatment guidelines advise that most cases of ITP may be managed through close&#xD;
      observation, while pharmacological interventions that may result in treatment-related&#xD;
      toxicities may be used in patients with more severe bleeding symptoms. In order to improve&#xD;
      the care and management of pediatric patients with ITP, it is necessary to develop a better&#xD;
      predictor of bleeding events and disease severity than the patient's platelet count.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous single-center study, investigators studied the association of different&#xD;
      platelet parameters with patient bleeding severity. Using whole blood from patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with severe ITP, investigators measured the immature platelet fraction (IPF) and absolute&#xD;
      immature platelet count (IPC) through a hematology analyzer (Sysmex XN-1000). Investigators&#xD;
      performed functional tests on the platelets and analyzed them through flow cytometry. In this&#xD;
      study, the investigators found that the IPF and IPC is associated with patient bleeding&#xD;
      severity, independent of platelet count. It was also determined that functional activation&#xD;
      markers such as P-selectin and glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa are significantly associated with&#xD;
      subsequent bleeding severity in children, independent of platelet count. The results of these&#xD;
      proposed studies in ITP patients may suggest clinically relevant uses of these assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To confirm these findings, this trial will repeat the previous study in a multi-center&#xD;
      patient population, including a greater number of patients with severe bleeding and low&#xD;
      platelet counts.&#xD;
