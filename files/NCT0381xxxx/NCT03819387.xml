  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-controlled study conducted in two parts - Part A (dose escalation)&#xD;
      followed by Part B (dose expansion).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients in Part A will have previously treated progressive or metastatic NSCLC, pancreatic,&#xD;
      or colorectal cancer, with or without KRAS mutation. Five dose levels will be explored. In&#xD;
      dose level 5, only patients with previously-treated NSCLC with KRAS mutation will be&#xD;
      included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in Part B must have previously treated NSCLC with confirmed KRAS mutation. Two dose&#xD;
      levels will be explored further in Part B. Twenty (20) patients will be enrolled in Part B,&#xD;
      with 10 patients enrolled in each of the two cohorts. Once dose level 5 has been confirmed to&#xD;
      be safe in Part A (i.e. 0-1 DLT in 6 patients), an additional 4 patients will then be&#xD;
      enrolled for a planned total of 24 patients in Part B.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Part A: Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed progressive or&#xD;
             metastatic NSCLC, pancreatic, or colorectal cancer that have failed standard treatment&#xD;
             and for which no other effective treatment is available or appropriate for the patient&#xD;
             up to dose level 4. In dose level 5, patients with histologically or cytologically&#xD;
             confirmed progressive or metastatic NSCLC with documented KRAS-mutant genotype, who&#xD;
             have failed standard treatment and have no other effective treatment available or&#xD;
             appropriate for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Part B: Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed progressive or&#xD;
             metastatic NSCLC with documented KRAS-mutant genotype, who have failed standard&#xD;
             treatment and have no other effective treatment available or appropriate for the&#xD;
