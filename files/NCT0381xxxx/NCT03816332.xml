    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies how well tacrolimus, nivolumab, and ipilimumab work in treating&#xD;
      kidney transplant recipients with cancer that cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable) or&#xD;
      has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Tacrolimus may stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving&#xD;
      tacrolimus, nivolumab, and ipilimumab may work better in treating kidney transplant&#xD;
      recipients with cancer compared to chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy, or targeted&#xD;
      therapies.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the percent of kidney transplant recipients with selected advanced cancers for&#xD;
      whom standard therapies would be insufficient who, 16 weeks after administration of&#xD;
      prednisone, tacrolimus, and nivolumab, experience complete response (CR), partial response&#xD;
      (PR), or stable disease (SD) without allograft loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the objective response rate (ORR), rate of allograft loss, and durations of&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the ORR and rate of allograft loss in patients who experience progressive&#xD;
      disease (PD) after administration of nivolumab and 1) receive ipilimumab and nivolumab, or 2)&#xD;
      decrease or discontinue immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize correlates of the host immune response, possibly including, but not&#xD;
      limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ia. Histopathological characteristics of allograft rejection/loss. Ib. Immunological changes&#xD;
      in the tumor microenvironment (e.g., changes in T-cell subset populations or expression of&#xD;
      immune checkpoint molecules) in paired biopsies obtained pre-treatment and on-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ic. Changes in donor-derived cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (dd-cfDNA) as a marker for&#xD;
      allograft rejection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Id. Characteristics of anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1)-associated immune-mediated adverse&#xD;
      reactions (IMAR) in this patient population treated with immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive tacrolimus orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and prednisone PO once daily (QD).&#xD;
      Within 28 days, patients then receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1.&#xD;
      Cycles repeat every 4 weeks for up to 24 cycles (96 weeks) in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who experience progressive disease (PD) or patients who have experienced allograft&#xD;
      loss at 16 weeks receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes and ipilimumab IV over 30 minutes on&#xD;
      day 1. Patients also receive tacrolimus PO BID and prednisone PO QD. Cycles repeat every 3&#xD;
      weeks for 4 cycles (12 weeks) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Starting 6 weeks later, patients receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes every 4 weeks for up to&#xD;
      21 cycles (84 weeks) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 90 days, every 8 weeks for&#xD;
      year 1, every 12 weeks for year 2, every 16 weeks for year 3, then every 24 weeks for year 4.&#xD;
      Patients with PD are followed up every 12 weeks for up to 5 years.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be kidney transplant recipients with a functioning allograft who do not&#xD;
             currently require dialysis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed melanoma, basal cell&#xD;
             carcinoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or microsatellite&#xD;
             instability (MSI)-high cancers for which standard non-immunological medical, surgical,&#xD;
             or radiation therapy would be insufficient (i.e., patients who are not surgical&#xD;
             candidates). This trial is not intended to provide therapy as a neoadjuvant approach&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)&#xD;
             1.1 criteria, i.e., at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least&#xD;
             one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for non-nodal lesions and short axis&#xD;
             for nodal lesions) as &gt;= 20 mm by chest x-ray or as &gt;= 10 mm with computed tomography&#xD;
             (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or calipers by clinical exam is&#xD;
             preferred, but not required. Patients with evaluable disease but no target lesions&#xD;
             (e.g., evaluable bone metastases) may be included after discussion with the principal&#xD;
             investigator (PI)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have documentation, in consultation with the PI, that they received,&#xD;
             refused, or were ineligible for the following non-immunologic therapies:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For patients with:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  BRAF-mutant melanoma: prior therapies include BRAF/MEK inhibitors&#xD;

                    -  Merkel cell carcinoma: prior therapies include platinum + VP-16&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Basal cell carcinoma: prior therapies include Hedgehog pathway inhibitors&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma: prior therapies include cetuximab&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2&#xD;
             (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Leukocytes &gt;= 2,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/mcL&#xD;

                  consultation with the study PI&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of nivolumab and ipilimumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For&#xD;
             this reason, and because other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be&#xD;
             teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) and men must agree to use&#xD;
             adequate contraception (e.g., hormonal or barrier methods of birth control, or&#xD;
             abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 31&#xD;
             weeks after the last dose of nivolumab or ipilimumab. Women who are not of&#xD;
             childbearing potential (i.e., who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile) as well as&#xD;
             azoospermic men do not require contraception. WOCBP must have a negative serum or&#xD;
             urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of beta-human&#xD;
             chorionic gonadotropin [B-HCG]) during the screening period. Follow-up evaluations&#xD;
             will include interval sexual/menstrual histories as needed. Men who receive nivolumab&#xD;
             or ipilimumab and are sexually active with WOCBP must use a contraceptive method with&#xD;
             a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year for the duration of the study and for a period of 7&#xD;
             months after the last dose of nivolumab or ipilimumab. Should a woman become pregnant&#xD;
             or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study,&#xD;
             she (or the participating partner) should inform the treating physician immediately.&#xD;
             WOCBP is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone&#xD;
             surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not&#xD;
             postmenopausal. Menopause is defined clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman&#xD;
             over 45 in the absence of other biological or physiological causes. Women under the&#xD;
             age of 55 must have a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level less&#xD;
             than 40 mIU/mL to be considered postmenopausal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients will be eligible for this trial&#xD;
             if they are on effective antiretroviral regimens utilizing non-CYP-interactive agents&#xD;
             and have an undetectable viral load. If there is evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus&#xD;
             (HBV) infection, HBV viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if&#xD;
             indicated. If there is history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, the patient must&#xD;
             have been treated and have undetectable HCV viral load&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to understand and be willing to sign a written informed consent&#xD;
             document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have received a liver, lung, heart, or pancreas transplant; or&#xD;
             allogeneic stem cell transplant; or any kind of bone marrow transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not be unwilling or unable to undergo dialysis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have prior evidence of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) or non-HLA&#xD;
             donor-specific antibodies (DSA). Patients with detectable DSA but negative dd-cfDNA&#xD;
             may be eligible after consultation with the study PI&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have a history of antibody- or cell-mediated allograft rejection&#xD;
             within 3 months of study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks of study entry&#xD;
             or those who have not recovered from adverse events (AEs) due to agents administered&#xD;
             more than 4 weeks earlier&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have had prior treatment for their current cancer with an anti-PD-1,&#xD;
             anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, or anti-CTLA-4 antibody, or any other antibody or drug&#xD;
             specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or immune checkpoint pathways&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not be receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have known central nervous system (CNS) metastases or leptomeningeal&#xD;
             metastases because of poor prognosis and concerns regarding progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other AEs. Patients&#xD;
             with brain metastases are permitted to enroll if metastases have been treated and&#xD;
             there is no MRI evidence of progression for 4 weeks after treatment is complete and no&#xD;
             evidence of progression within 28 days prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal&#xD;
             antibody&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of&#xD;
             similar chemical or biologic composition to other agents used in study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited&#xD;
             to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina&#xD;

             limit compliance with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because nivolumab and ipilimumab have the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for AEs in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with nivolumab or&#xD;
             ipilimumab. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have active autoimmune disease, or history of autoimmune disease&#xD;
             that might recur, which may affect vital organ function, and will only be eligible&#xD;
             after consultation with the study PI&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  Scleroderma,&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; e.g., ulcerative colitis or Crohn's&#xD;
                       disease),&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Rheumatoid arthritis, and&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Sjogren's syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have had evidence of active or acute diverticulitis, intra-abdominal&#xD;
             abscess, gastrointestinal (GI) obstruction and abdominal carcinomatosis which are&#xD;
             known risk factors for bowel perforation should be evaluated for the potential need&#xD;
             for additional treatment before coming on study&#xD;
