    <textblock>
      &quot;Tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) include pyosalpinx, ovarian abscess, tubo-ovarian abscess and&#xD;
      Douglas abscess. The only randomized study evaluating TOA treatment reported a higher cure&#xD;
      rate (90 versus 65%) when antibiotic therapy is associated with abscess evacuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TOA evacuation can be performed by surgery or by drainage. No studies have compared success&#xD;
      rates between those two methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerning surgery, current practices recommend performing laparoscopy which allows a shorter&#xD;
      hospital stay, a lower complication rate and high success rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of published studies reporting radiological drainage concern ultrasound-guided&#xD;
      transvaginal drainage. The reported success rates range from 77 to 100%. The PACTOL trial is&#xD;
      a randomized, prospective, controlled, open, parallel, non-inferiority, multicenter trial&#xD;
      comparing the efficacy of transvaginal drainage versus laparoscopy in both arms with&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy in the treatment of TOA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) include pyosalpinx, ovarian abscess, tubo-ovarian abscess and&#xD;
      Douglas abscess from genital organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only randomized study evaluating TOA treatment reported a higher cure rate (90 versus&#xD;
      65%) when antibiotic therapy is associated with abscess evacuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This TOA evacuation can be performed by surgery or by drainage. No studies have compared,&#xD;
      even retrospectively, success rates between those two methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current practices recommend performing conservative surgery by laparoscopy which allows a&#xD;
      shorter hospital stay, a lower complication rate and high success rates (90%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of published studies reporting radiological drainage concern ultrasound-guided&#xD;
      transvaginal drainage. The reported success rates range from 77 to 100%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the literature supports the association antibiotic / evacuation of the TOA (surgical or&#xD;
      drainage) because of a high success rate. However, there is no comparative data to favor&#xD;
      laparoscopic evacuation over transvaginal drainage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The French recommendations for the management of TOA recommend the use of transvaginal&#xD;
      drainage or laparoscopy for the treatment of ATO always in combination with antibiotics. The&#xD;
      recommended antibiotic treatment combines triantibiotherapy with doxycycline, cephalosporin&#xD;
      and metronidazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the PACTOL trial will be to demonstrate non-inferiority of the&#xD;
      transvaginal approach in the treatment of ATO versus laparoscopy in terms of efficacy. The&#xD;
      secondary objective of our study is to confirm the less invasive nature of transvaginal&#xD;
      drainage (reduction of hospital stay, reduction of hospital costs and better tolerance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PACTOL trial is a randomized, prospective, controlled, open, parallel, non-inferiority,&#xD;
      multicenter trial comparing the efficacy of transvaginal drainage versus laparoscopy in both&#xD;
      arms with antibiotic therapy in the treatment of TOA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions The PACTOL trial will compare two techniques of TOA evacuation : transvaginal&#xD;
      drainage and laparoscopy drainage. In both cases, preoperative anesthesic consultation will&#xD;
      be performed. All included patients will be hospitalized and treated with intravenous&#xD;
      antibiotics according of French national guidelines. The TOA evacuation will be performed&#xD;
      according to the result of randomization within 3 days of hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be included after receiving consent to participate in the study. After&#xD;
      inclusion, randomization will be performed with two parallel arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  arm A : intravenous probabilistic triantibiotherapy + TOA drainage by transvaginal&#xD;
           drainage under ultrasound control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm B : intravenous probabilistic triantibiotherapy + TOA drainage by laparoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The computerized randomization procedure will be performed before the surgery. The&#xD;
      randomization should take place maximum 3 days after the beginning of the antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms, a probabilistic triantibiotherapy known as a reference for the treatment of TOA&#xD;
      in genital infection will be delivered as soon as the patient is hospitalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This triantibiotherapy will be composed by Ceftriaxone 1 to 2g x1 per day + Metronidazole 500&#xD;
      mg x3 per day + Doxycycline 100 mg x2 per day intravenously initially then per os and&#xD;
      intramuscular for 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of allergy, alternatives may be Ofloxacin 400 mg x 2 per day + Metronidazole 500 mg x&#xD;
      3 per day IV for 21 days or Cefoxitin 1 to 2 gx 3 per day + Doxycycline 100 mg x 2 per day IV&#xD;
      for 21 days according to the recommendations of the CNGOF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A : Transvaginal drainage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be managed in the operating room, with simple sedation, in lithotomy&#xD;
      position. If the patient is not comfortable, a general anesthesia will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operator (a senior physician) will use pelvic ultrasound by the endovaginal route to&#xD;
      identify TOA. The content of the abscess will be aspirated using a syringe and will be sent&#xD;
      for bacteriological analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B : Laparoscopy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be managed in the operating room, under general anesthesia. The surgical&#xD;
      approach will be laparoscopic. The operator (a senior doctor) will report the inventory of&#xD;
      the pelvis and abdomen. The TOA will then be located and evacuated with a collection of the&#xD;
      drainage liquid to send it for bacteriological analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conservative treatment will be recommended but left to the discretion of the operator. After&#xD;
      complete drainage and washing of the pelvic cavity, the procedure will be completed. Drainage&#xD;
      by redon left in place will be recommended but also left to the choice of the operator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examination on inclusion The initial assessment will be performed in the hospital emergency&#xD;
      by a gynecologist. Patient's hemodynamic variables (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature)&#xD;
      will be recorded and signs of shock sought. The pelvic examination will include an abdominal&#xD;
      palpation, speculum examination searching for leucorrhoea, metrorrhagia, cervical&#xD;
      examination, vaginal and endocervical sampling for chlamydia, gonococci, mycoplasma. Vaginal&#xD;
      examination looking for pain during uterine mobilization, lateralized pain in the vaginal sac&#xD;
      and lateral uterine mass will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological tests searching for inflammatory syndrome, urinary infection, pregnancy test as&#xD;
      well as preoperative tests will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pelvic ultrasound for the diagnosis of TOA will be performed using suprapubic and endovaginal&#xD;
      routes with 2 baseline measurements in the sagittal plane and a measurement in the axial&#xD;
      plane of the latero-uterine mass. If there is doubt about the diagnosis, performing a CT or&#xD;
      MRI is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion and non-inclusion criteria will be verified by gynecologist. Details of the&#xD;
      protocol will be provided to the patient through a written notice and oral explanations.&#xD;
      Signed consent forms will be collected from patients agreeing to participate in the study&#xD;
      prior to enrollment, by a senior gynecologist acting as a local investigator in the trial.&#xD;
      The patient will be informed of the possibility of using her data for a future fertility&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be included after receiving consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Once the patient has been informed, informed consent obtained and the criteria&#xD;
      for inclusion and exclusion have been checked, a single-blind randomization with a 1:1 ratio&#xD;
      will be performed electronically with a secure internet platform (CleanWeb) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization list will be generated by computer, stratified per center, with blocks of&#xD;
      different sizes. The day of the randomization will be considered as the beginning of&#xD;
      follow-up (D0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized during their hospitalization, during the inclusion visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the nature of the intervention, health professionals and patients cannot be blinded to&#xD;
      the randomization group. However, the evaluation of the primary endpoint will be done by the&#xD;
      statistician who will be blind to the treatment received by each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intrahospital management During their stay in hospital, the patients will be managed&#xD;
      according to the standard practice of the center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In hospital, according to the usage, a monitoring of the temperature, the arterial pressure,&#xD;
      the heart rate, the saturation will be carried out every 6 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinical examination by a gynecologist will be carried out daily to follow up the infection&#xD;
      and to detect possible complications secondary to treatment. During this evaluation, the pain&#xD;
      will be quantified using a visual analogue scale the next day and 3 days after the TOA&#xD;
      evacuation. The EQ-5D questionnaire and a standardized surgical report will also be given to&#xD;
      the patient during this consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative consultation For the determination of the primary outcome, an ultrasound and&#xD;
      postoperative consultation are planned at 6 weeks of hospitalization +/- 2 weeks. This&#xD;
      consultation will&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  inform if a reintervention (transvaginal drainage, laparoscopy or laparotomy) or a new&#xD;
           antibiotic treatment were necessary to treat a recurrence of TOA since discharge from&#xD;
           hospital. The practitioner will look for a recurrence of TOA through the clinical&#xD;
           examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  report any post-operative complications that will be classified according to the&#xD;
           Clavien-Dindo classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  inform the patient's desire and plan to obtain a pregnancy during the next two years in&#xD;
           order to decide to include the patient in the evaluation of fertility after treatment of&#xD;
           an TOA by comparing transvaginal drainage and laparoscopy. Patients with a pregnancy&#xD;
           desire will be informed that TOA can be complicated by infertility. Then, patients with&#xD;
           difficulties in procreation can be offered a diagnostic laparoscopy to find a cause of&#xD;
           infertility, depending on the etiological assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up Patients who will not attend the postoperative consultation will be contacted by&#xD;
      phone to collect data regarding possible recurrence of TOA and postoperative complications.&#xD;
      If the patient does not attend a scheduled appointment, she will be contacted by phone to&#xD;
      arrange a new appointment. For this, a record of his personal details (name, phone,&#xD;
      availability) will be kept in her medical file. After 3 phone call attempts (different days&#xD;
      and time slots), the patient will be considered lost to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After their initial postoperative consultation, patients will attend follow up 2 years for&#xD;
      those who had a pregnancy desire. These one will be contacted by phone 24 months after their&#xD;
      beginning of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have follow-up in the form of a phone interview or self-administered&#xD;
      questionnaire sent by email or mail (depending on patients preference) 2 years after drainage&#xD;
      of the abscess to assess the secondary criterion of pregnancy rate.&quot;&#xD;
