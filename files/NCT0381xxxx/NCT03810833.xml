  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate background fluorescence of participants of different ages,&#xD;
      gender, and skin color. In addition, 48-hour tolerability of the sensor and adhesive will be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;

      The MediBeacon Transdermal GFR Measurement System investigational is intended to measure the&#xD;
      Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in patients with normal or impaired renal function by&#xD;
      noninvasively monitoring fluorescent light emission from an exogenous tracer agent (MB-102)&#xD;
      over time. The device utilized in this study is the Brilliance device. Approximately 1 male&#xD;
      and 1 female from each age cohort (18-50 years; 51+ years) and clustered Fitzpatrick Skin&#xD;
      Scale groups (I-II [Light, pale white; white, fair]; III-IV [Medium, white to olive; olive,&#xD;
      moderate brown]; and V-VI [Brown, dark brown; black, very dark brown to black]) will be&#xD;
      recruited, for a total of 12 participants. Participants will have Brilliance device sensors&#xD;
      placed on two locations on their skin, which will remain for 48 hours. The sensor location&#xD;
      will be prepared through shaving and cleaning (as applicable), placed on the skin via&#xD;
      standard single-use adhesive pads, and baseline measurements collected. Participants may&#xD;
      undergo activities of daily living while measurements are being collected. Light pressure and&#xD;
      other minor perturbations may be applied to the sensors to evaluate the effect on background&#xD;
      fluorescence. Adverse events associated with sensor placement (such as skin irritations) will&#xD;
      be recorded.&#xD;
