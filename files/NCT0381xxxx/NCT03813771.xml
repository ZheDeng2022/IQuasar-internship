  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the study is to determine the clinical utility of naive T-cell stratification&#xD;
      for rationalising treatment with methotrexate (MTX), for DMARD-naive early RA patients. Thus,&#xD;
      it aims to determine whether TNFi therapy (Benepali) instituted as first-line therapy in&#xD;
      DMARD-naive early RA patients with poor T-cell prognostication confers better outcomes&#xD;
      (clinical, structural and immunological). Hence, this would enable early targeted treatment&#xD;
      for those with a poorer prognosis based on their immunological status.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current optimal therapeutic approach in early RA is to start MTX to target inflammation&#xD;
      and induce remission.Prediction of MTX therapy response remains a key clinical need to enable&#xD;
      the identification of patients who would benefit from an alternative, more aggressive&#xD;
      treatment strategy. Multiple predictors of remission with MTX have been reported over the&#xD;
      years but none have entered routine clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We previously reported that T-cell phenotyping at baseline could predict remission in&#xD;
      DMARD-naïve early RA treated with MTX. Reduced naïve CD4+ T-cell frequency was the most&#xD;
      predictive factor, using both a pilot and a replication cohort.These data confirmed the&#xD;
      potential value of using naïve CD4+ T-cells as a biomarker of MTX induced remission in early&#xD;
      RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical utility of measuring T-cell subsets is therefore strongly indicated by these&#xD;
      data and suggests that measurement of T- cell subsets can be used to rationalise the use of&#xD;
      MTX as first-line therapy.Predicting response to MTX has important clinical value to identify&#xD;
      patients who will do well on MTX but furthermore for directing those who will have a&#xD;
      sub-optimal response to MTX to receive alternative therapy without any harmful delay and in&#xD;
      line with the treat to target principle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study aims to confirm/validate the clinical value of T-cell subset quantification&#xD;
      for the prediction of MTX response in early RA, by stratified interventions based on baseline&#xD;
      naïve CD4+ T-cell status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Single centre, phase IV, open-label, prospective, longitudinal cohort study with an&#xD;
      embedded pilot randomised controlled trial that aims to assess whether MTX can be&#xD;
      rationalised as a first-line treatment for DMARD-naïve early RA patients, according to&#xD;
      baseline naïve CD4+ T-cell stratification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with newly diagnosed RA satisfying the inclusion criteria will be recruited from our&#xD;
      early arthritis clinic. Eligible patients will be provided with written information on the&#xD;
      study and will be given a minimum of 24 hours to read this information prior to being&#xD;
      contacted by a research nurse (within one week). If interested they will be invited to a&#xD;
      screening appointment within four weeks to confirm eligibility, obtain written consent and to&#xD;
      collect the necessary clinical and laboratory data as per the study schedule. Following the&#xD;
      screening visit, patients will attend a baseline assessment within four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be stratified based on their naïve CD4+ T-cell frequency (normal or abnormal&#xD;
      based on our pre-defined cut-off values according to age and sex-matched controls). Patients&#xD;
      with a normal T-cell frequency (Arm A) will commence MTX 15mg/week PO (+HCQ 400mg od) as per&#xD;
      standard T2T practice. Follow-up (4, 12 and 24 weeks), dose escalation of MTX and treatment&#xD;
      of flare will also be conducted in line with T2T care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with an abnormal T-cell frequency will be randomized 1:1 into 2 groups using&#xD;
      randomly permuted block sizes and also followed up as per T2T care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first group (Arm B) will receive MTX 15mg/week PO (+HCQ 400mg od) The second group (Arm&#xD;
      C) will receive MTX 15mg/week PO (+HCQ 400mg od) in combination with 50 mg subcutaneous&#xD;
      Benepali® administered weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up for a period of 24 weeks and will undergo clinical,&#xD;
      immunological and imaging assessments as stated in the study schedule. Following completion&#xD;
      of the study, patients will either be followed up in our established inflammatory arthritis&#xD;
      or biologics clinic. Patients in group C will discontinue their Benepali®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will take place at the rheumatology out-patient department in Chapel Allerton&#xD;
      Hospital, Leeds.&#xD;
