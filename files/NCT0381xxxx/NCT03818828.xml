  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that application at 4-week intervals of the human umbilical cord tissue&#xD;
      TTAX01 to the surface of a well debrided, nonhealing venous leg ulcer (VLU) will result in a&#xD;
      high proportion of wounds showing complete healing within 12 weeks of initiating therapy.&#xD;
      This open label pilot study provides a framework for a larger, controlled study. The purposes&#xD;
      for conducting this study are to evaluate the functionality of the protocol and to obtain an&#xD;
      estimate of product safety and efficacy when applied according to the protocol instructions,&#xD;
      and measured according to the stated endpoints.&#xD;

    <description>Change from baseline in pain level as reported using a numeric rating scale for the target ulcer and the affected leg, separately. Subjects will be asked to rate the level of pain they experience on a scale from 0 to 10, with 0 representing &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 representing &quot;the worst possible pain&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Sheffield Preference-based Venous Ulcer questionnaire (SPVU-5D) quality of life questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 17 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SPVU-5D is a condition-specific preference-based measure of health-related quality of life for use in the assessment of the impact of venous ulceration. It has five dimensions encompassing physical, psychological and social aspects. The dimensions have between three and five levels. The measure was developed from the bottom-up and incorporates items generated from patients. The measure has been shown to have good practicality and validity. Preference-weights and a scoring algorithm were produced based on valuations from the UK population.</description>

    <description>TTAX01 will be applied directly to the wound surface and fixed with sterile adhesive strips, plus a secondary foam dressing held in place by multi-layer compression bandaging. A single layer of the test article should cover the entire open surface of the wound. TTAX01 may overlap onto adjacent healthy tissue and must be fenestrated prior to or after fixture. The material is to be applied once every 4 weeks unless the wound shows evidence of healing, in which case product will be withheld; or, if the test article has been accidentally dislodged within 1-week post application, it may be replaced at the subsequent treatment visit.</description>

    <description>TTAX01 is a cryopreserved human umbilical cord product derived from donated human placental tissue following healthy, live, caesarian section, full-term births after determination of donor eligibility and placenta suitability. TTAX01 is manufactured by TissueTech Inc. utilizing a proprietary CRYOTEK® process, which devitalizes the living cells but retains the natural structural and biological characteristics relevant to this tissue. TTAX01 is aseptically processed in compliance with current Good Tissue Practices (cGTP). TTAX01 will be manufactured in various sizes, stored in a medium of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium/Glycerol (1:1) containing Amphotericin B.</description>
