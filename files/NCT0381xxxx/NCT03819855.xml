    <textblock>
      Septic arthritis is a diagnostic emergency for acute arthritis because it is accompanied by&#xD;
      an excess of mortality of 11% and frequent functional sequelae in about 50% of cases in the&#xD;
      year. However, it remains rare with an estimated annual incidence of 1 to 5/100000, and a&#xD;
      prevalence of about 10% in front of an acute arthritis table sent to an emergency department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis is based on the bacteriological culture which finds the presence of a&#xD;
      microorganism within the joint. However, only 80% of septic arthritis is bacteriologically&#xD;
      documented due to low inoculum, the presence of fragile bacteria (Neisseria sp) or especially&#xD;
      untimely antibiotherapy prior to joint puncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the bacteriological culture takes an average of 3 days to become positive, which&#xD;
      may delay the implementation of appropriate antibiotic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore essential that the clinician can rely on other clinical or biological&#xD;
      parameters, reliable and fast for better diagnostic orientation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A first study: SYNOLACTATES showed the interest of the measurement of glucose and synovial&#xD;
      lactate for the diagnosis of septic arthritis with very good performances. A RESAS score&#xD;
      (REnnes Septic Arthritis Score) was constructed from these results to assess the likelihood&#xD;
      of septic arthritis.&#xD;
