    <textblock>
      Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental&#xD;
      disorders experienced in childhood, with limited options for effective pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment. Transcendental Meditation (TM) has been proposed to be used as a tool for&#xD;
      attentional training and modulating autonomic nervous system activity in the ADHD population.&#xD;
      However, the empirical support in favor of meditation for ADHD is limited, and the mechanism&#xD;
      by which TM may have an effect on ADD/ADHD is not understood. There is also a conflicted data&#xD;
      as to the nature of autonomic dysregulation of ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart Rate Variability (HRV) represents the beat to beat changes of heart rate in the&#xD;
      interbeat interval, and considered to be a non-invasive tool to study autonomic nervous&#xD;
      system. There is evidence that a non-directive meditation may increase parasympathetic&#xD;
      activity and overall HRV. To the best of our knowledge, the differential effect of meditation&#xD;
      on ADHD symptoms: according to the baseline HRV of the participants, or ADHD subtypes has not&#xD;
      been assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to collect the data on ADHD adolescents who will get TM training as&#xD;
      a part of out-of-school program, which is offered all children diagnosed with ADD/ADHD, aged&#xD;
      11.5 y-16y, in the community center of Kadima-Zoran, Israel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of all of the children participating in this program will be performed with&#xD;
      the help of validated questionnaires for diagnosis and follow-up of ADD/ADHD, and HRV&#xD;
      monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to perform an assessment in a controlled way, the instruction of TM shall take place&#xD;
      in two cycles of 3 months each.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental&#xD;
      disorders experienced in childhood, with a prevalence of 5 -10%, and can persist into&#xD;
      adulthood (1) It is characterized by a combination of overactive, poorly modulated behavior&#xD;
      with marked inattention and may involve physical aggression, which may be associated with a&#xD;
      number of structural and functional abnormalities in the central nervous system (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacological treatment is often the treatment of choice; however its effectiveness is&#xD;
      limited and often involves considerable side effects (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meditation has been proposed to be used as a tool for attentional training and modulating&#xD;
      autonomic nervous system activity in the ADHD population. A systematic review of meditation-&#xD;
      based interventions for children with ADHD could not reach definite conclusions regarding&#xD;
      their efficacy due to poor methodological quality of the studies (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot randomized controlled study published few years ago demonstrated that three months of&#xD;
      TM practice resulted in significant improvement of ADHD symptoms (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism by which TM may have an effect on ADD/ADHD is not understood. Furthermore, it&#xD;
      is not clear whether TM may have a differential effect on the two subclasses of this&#xD;
      condition: inattentive- and hyperactive- type&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals with ADHD probably have imbalances in autonomic nervous system activity, which&#xD;
      may be associated with impairment of sustained attention (6) and emotional regulation&#xD;
      (7,8,9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart Rate Variability (HRV) represents the beat to beat changes of heart rate in the&#xD;
      interbeat interval, resulting from dynamic balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic inputs&#xD;
      to the heart being a non-invasive tool to study autonomic nervous system, has been proposed&#xD;
      to be related to cognitive performance (10) and be a potential marker of stress (11). A lower&#xD;
      resting HRV has been associated with greater difficulties in emotional regulation, especially&#xD;
      a lack of emotional clarity and impulse control (12), depression and anxiety states (15),&#xD;
      while higher levels - with higher cognitive performance, increased emotional regulation and&#xD;
      perception of well-being (13, 14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is however no agreement as to the nature of autonomic dysregulation of ADHD (9,16,17).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of meditation on autonomic nervous system via changes in heart rate variability&#xD;
      has been studied recently. Interestingly, some of the techniques were associated with lower&#xD;
      HRV (18), while others - with increased parasympathetic activity and HRV (19). To the best of&#xD;
      our knowledge, the differential effect of meditation on ADHD symptoms: according to the&#xD;
      baseline HRV of the participants, or ADHD subtypes has not been assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To collect the data on ADHD adolescents who will get TM training&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess whether improvement of symptoms may be sustained for 3 months after the&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess whether the effect of TM on ADHD symptoms may be correlated with the baseline&#xD;
           HRV or ADHD subtypes of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design TM classes are going to take place in the facility of Community Center at the&#xD;
      Kadima Zoran Community Center for Culture and Sport (as an out-of-school program): a group of&#xD;
      TM instructors will provide TM teaching to the adolescents with ADD/ADHD of the Zoran school,&#xD;
      with the consent of the teachers and the parents of the children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since March 2019, the TM classes will be offered to all children aged 11.5 y-16y, with a&#xD;
      confirmed diagnosis of ADD/ADHD, under supervision of the school teachers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 50 adolescents out of 60 adolescents, diagnosed with ADHD shall participate in this&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment and follow-up on these children will be performed by pediatric neurologist and&#xD;
      HRV monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The instruction of TM shall be in two groups (of 20-30 children each). TM training for each&#xD;
      group shall be 3 months. The children in both groups shall be followed up for 6 months, and&#xD;
      assessed by the same parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 50 adolescents out of 60 adolescents, diagnosed with ADHD who study at this school, are&#xD;
      expected to participate in this program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A senior pediatric neurologist will examine the children, confirm the diagnosis, according to&#xD;
      the DSM 5 criteria, and shall obtain a written informed consent for the evaluation of the&#xD;
      children during this program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current pharmacological treatment, ADHD subtype (e.g. inattentive type, combined type or&#xD;
      mixed type) and the comorbidities will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two certified teachers of TM will teach these children according to the following protocol,&#xD;
      as previously described by Grosswald et al(20):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will have an individual instruction for 1 hour, followed by a course of 3&#xD;
      weekly group meetings (1-1.5 hours) The students shall meditate in a group for 10 minutes,&#xD;
      twice a day, during 3 months, under the supervision of school teachers who will be instructed&#xD;
      in TM technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group follow-up will be performed 10 days after a completion of the course, and then each&#xD;
      participant will receive personal meetings with TM instructor on a weekly basis during the&#xD;
      first month, and then twice a month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After additional 3 months participants in this group will be examined again, to assess&#xD;
      sustainability of the effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 Following the completion of the first 3 months period, the second group will receive&#xD;
      TM training as above, and during the first 3 months this will be a reference (control) group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be analyzed according to the treatment groups. Similarly to the previous study&#xD;
      (20) the expected statistical power of 93%will be calculated for comparison of means (Student&#xD;
      T-test) .The assumed difference between groups is 0.1 and adopted Standard Deviation within&#xD;
      the groups is Â±0.1 (20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional observations will be assessed according to the baseline HRV (sympathetic or&#xD;
      parasympathetic predominance) and the ADHD subgroups (inattentive or hyperactive&#xD;
      predominance), while the two ADHD subgroups and two HRV subgroups will be assessed&#xD;
      independently with dichotomous outcomes. In the probable case that the two TM groups (A&amp;B)&#xD;
      shall not be significantly different, both groups may br assessed as one cohort with n=50,&#xD;
      assuming dichotomous outcomes. This project may provide a preliminary assessment of the&#xD;
      impact of ADHD subtype and of baseline HRV on the differential effect of TM on ADHD symptoms.&#xD;
