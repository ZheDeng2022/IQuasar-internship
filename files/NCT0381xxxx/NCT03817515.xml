        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A patient will be eligible for inclusion in this expanded access program only if all of the&#xD;
        following criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. a) Diagnosis of advanced (locally advanced and inoperable or metastatic) malignant&#xD;
             PEComa confirmed by pathology and immunohistochemistry, whether or not previously&#xD;
             exposed to an mTOR inhibitor, or b) diagnosis of any other malignancy with activation&#xD;
             in any mTOR pathway component as identified by immunohistochemistry or an identified&#xD;
             relevant rare genetic mutation in mTOR pathway genes, including but not limited to&#xD;
             TSC1, TSC2, PIK3CA, PTEN, for which there are no FDA-approved treatments or no other&#xD;
             comparable or satisfactory alternative therapies available whether or not they been&#xD;
             previously exposed to a mTOR inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. 18 years or older, with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status&#xD;
             0, 1, or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Acceptable blood chemistry levels at screening (obtained ≤14 days prior to enrollment&#xD;
             (local laboratory) including:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. total bilirubin ≤1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. AST ≤2.5 x ULN (≤5 x ULN if attributable to liver metastases)&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Adequate biological parameters as demonstrated by the following blood counts at&#xD;
             screening (obtained ≤14 days prior to enrollment, local laboratory):&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.5 × 109/L;&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Platelet count ≥100,000/mm3 (100 × 109/L);&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Hemoglobin ≥8 g/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Fasting serum triglyceride &lt;300 mg/dL; fasting serum total cholesterol &lt;350 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Male or non-pregnant and non-breast feeding female:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Females of child-bearing potential must agree to use effective contraception&#xD;
                  without interruption from 28 days prior to starting IP and while on&#xD;
                  investigational medication and have a negative serum pregnancy test (β -hCG)&#xD;
                  result at screening and agree to ongoing pregnancy testing during the course of&#xD;
                  the expanded access protocol, and after the end of treatment. A second form of&#xD;
                  birth control is required even if she has had a tubal ligation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male patients must practice abstinence or agree to use a condom during sexual&#xD;
                  contact with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential while&#xD;
                  participating in the expanded access protocol. A second form of birth control is&#xD;
                  required even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Ability to understand and sign informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A patient will not be eligible for inclusion in this protocol if any of the following&#xD;
        criteria apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Uncontrolled serious medical or psychiatric illness. Patients with a &quot;currently&#xD;
             active&quot; second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancers, carcinoma in situ of&#xD;
             the cervix, resected incidental prostate cancer (staged pT2 with Gleason Score ≤ 6 and&#xD;
             postoperative PSA &lt;0.5 ng/mL), or other adequately treated carcinoma-in-situ are&#xD;
             ineligible. Patients are not considered to have a &quot;currently active&quot; malignancy if&#xD;
             they have completed therapy and are free of disease for ≥1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. In the treating physician's opinion, the potential risks outweigh the potential&#xD;
             benefits of therapy with ABI-009.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prior exposure to ABI-009.&#xD;
