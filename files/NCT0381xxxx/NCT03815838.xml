  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Pituitary adenomas affect 10% of the population. Surgery offers the most&#xD;
      cost-effective treatment modality but cure rates are only 40-70%, in part due to the&#xD;
      limitations of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in visualising small tumours (up to 40% are&#xD;
      undetected) and discriminating adenomatous tissue from healthy pituitary or post-surgical&#xD;
      change. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging may improve localisation but current&#xD;
      tracers have short half-lives and are unsuitable for routine use. The dopaminergic system&#xD;
      regulates pituitary growth and function, as evidenced by the use of dopamine D2 receptor&#xD;
      agonists as medical therapy. Dopaminergic PET tracers, including 18F-FDOPA&#xD;
      (6-[18F]-L-fluoro-L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) and 18F (fluorine 18)-Fallypride (which binds&#xD;
      to D2/D3 receptors), might thus improve management by enhancing tumour discrimination and&#xD;
      quantifying D2 receptor expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To establish whether imaging changes in dopaminergic transmission and receptor function&#xD;
      has the potential to improve localisation of pituitary adenomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Subjects with pituitary adenomas will undergo 18F-FDOPA and 18F-Fallypride PET scans&#xD;
      in addition to standard pituitary MRI. Quantification of binding potential combined with MRI&#xD;
      co-registration to provide enhanced anatomical definition will be applied. In vivo D2&#xD;
      receptor binding will be correlated with ex vivo D2 receptor mRNA (messenger ribonucleic&#xD;
      acid) and protein expression from tumour samples removed at surgery.&#xD;

      Aim: In this proof-of-concept study, the investigators will seek to establish whether imaging&#xD;
      changes in Dopaminergic transmission and receptor function has the potential to improve&#xD;
      localisation and management of pituitary adenomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from the general endocrine and pituitary multidisciplinary clinics&#xD;
      at the University Hospital of Wales. Patients will comprise those with a confirmed pituitary&#xD;
      adenoma for whom pituitary imaging is indicated as part of standard clinical management.&#xD;
      Tumour functionality (Cushing's syndrome, Acromegaly, Prolactinoma, TSHoma) and&#xD;
      hypopituitarism will be established in accordance with established clinical practice.&#xD;
      Detailed surgical, pathological and post-operative data will be collected in each case, in&#xD;
      order to facilitate correlation of PET/MRI findings with key clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histopathological examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical specimens will be fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin as&#xD;
      per standard clinical practice. Histopathological confirmation of the presence and type of&#xD;
      pituitary adenoma will be established by typical microscopic appearances of an adenoma&#xD;
      supported by immunohistochemical staining for the relevant hormone (Growth hormone, ACTH&#xD;
      [Adrenocorticotrophic Hormone], Prolactin, TSH [Thyroid Stimulating Hormone], LH/FSH&#xD;
      [Luteinising hormone/Follicle Stimulating Hormone]). Tumour will also be stored snap frozen&#xD;
      for subsequent RNA and protein extraction, in order to quantify dopamine D2 short and long&#xD;
      isoform receptor expression. This will allow comparison of ex vivo receptor expression levels&#xD;
      with in vivo 18F-fallypride uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET-CT imaging:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo 18F-FDOPA and 18F-Fallypride imaging according to established protocols&#xD;
      in the PET imaging centre (PETIC) at the University Hospital of Wales. Both compounds will be&#xD;
      synthesised in compliance with good manufacturing practice, and have been produced and&#xD;
      validated for human use in PETIC since 2015. Subjects will refrain from taking alcohol and&#xD;
      caffeine for 4 hours before the PET scanning session. PET scans will be acquired using a&#xD;
      PET-CT (Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography) scanner with Time of Flight and a&#xD;
      64 slice CT in 3D list mode. Patients will be placed in the scanner in the supine position,&#xD;
      with the brain centred in the axial field of view. A CT scout view will be acquired to aid in&#xD;
      positioning of the patient following which the head will be fixed using a piece of surgical&#xD;
      tape.&#xD;
&#xD;
      18F-FDOPA protocol: For 18F-FDOPA, participants will be pre-treated with 150 mg (milligrams)&#xD;
      carbidopa and 400 mg entacapone 1 hour prior to radioisotope administration in order to block&#xD;
      peripheral metabolism of FDOPA and enhance specific signal detection. A low dose CT scan will&#xD;
      be acquired for positioning and attenuation correction. A single position Dynamic PET scan&#xD;
      will be acquired as 26 time-frames over 94.5 minutes (1 × 30 sec, 4 × 1 min, 3 × 2 min, 3 × 3&#xD;
      min, and 15 × 5 min). Immediately after the scan commences 111 MBq (Megabecquerels) of&#xD;
      18F-DOPA in normal saline will be administered via a long connecting tube as an intravenous&#xD;
      bolus at the start of scanning (avoiding brain stimuli). Data will be reconstructed using&#xD;
      OSEM (ordered-subsets expectation maximisation) following corrections for attenuation,&#xD;
      normalisation, scatter and patient movement. The cerebellum will be used to represent the&#xD;
      reference region for the data analysis and enable the generation of binding potential&#xD;
      parametric images using Logan plots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      18 F-Fallypride protocol: Dynamic acquisition of the PET scan will be started with a 30&#xD;
      second bolus administration of 18F Fallypride (2.6 MBq/kg body weight). Patients will undergo&#xD;
      3 hours of dynamic imaging (3 × 20 s, 3 × 1 min, 3 × 2 min, 3 × 3 min, 21 × 5 min, 2 × 8 min&#xD;
      and 4 × 10 min; 180 min in total)(with rest periods during the scan to reduce discomfort and&#xD;
      allow urinary voiding to reduce radiation dose to the bladder wall). Data will be&#xD;
      reconstructed using OSEM following corrections for attenuation, normalisation, scatter and&#xD;
      patient movement. The cerebellum will be used to represent the reference region for the data&#xD;
      analysis and enable the generation of binding potential parametric images using Logan plots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard and 3D gradient echo MRI:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MR imaging will be performed on a 1.5T (Tesla) MRI unit. High resolution coronal T2-weighted&#xD;
      images and coronal and sagittal T1-weighted spin echo (SE) images of the pituitary gland will&#xD;
      be obtained before contrast injection. After intravenous injection of gadopentetate&#xD;
      dimeglumine contrast the investigators will repeat the acquisition of the coronal and&#xD;
      sagittal T1-weighted SE images of the pituitary gland and will also record a high resolution&#xD;
      T1-weighted spoiled gradient (SPGR) acquisition sequence of the whole head to optimise&#xD;
      co-registration with the PET/CT data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Image processing and analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Image analysis techniques to include detailed profiling of tracer uptake across the sella&#xD;
      will be applied. Image processing will be performed using commercially available software&#xD;
      packages.&#xD;
