    <textblock>
      This prospective study will be performed in the Cardiothoracic (Chesterman) Department at&#xD;
      Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHSFT, Northern General Hospital. Pre-operative patients&#xD;
      undergoing surgical valvular intervention, breathing both spontaneously and mechanically will&#xD;
      be included in the trial. All patients will already have a central venous catheter inserted&#xD;
      as part of their ongoing care. Patients will be eligible for the study irrespective of&#xD;
      diagnosis or neck size. Patient demographical data will be recorded by Sam Jenkins following&#xD;
      written consent, the day before the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to determine if ultrasound assessment of Jugular Venous Pressure&#xD;
      (JVP) accurately predicts Central Venous Pressure (CVP). Secondary objectives aim to identify&#xD;
      if using the angle of Louis to approximate the location of the right atrium produces&#xD;
      inaccuracies when measuring JVP. Comparing results in patients breathing spontaneously or&#xD;
      under positive pressure ventilation will identify if the form of ventilation impacts on JVP&#xD;
      and CVP recording. Correlating results between physical JVP examination and ultrasound&#xD;
      assessment of JVP to measure CVP will conclude if ultrasound is a more appropriate tool, in&#xD;
      an era where the physical examination of the cardiovascular system is becoming less valuable.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Initial exploratory investigations will compare left-sided and right-sided Jugular Venous&#xD;
      Pressure (JVP) using ultrasonography. Should results show that they are the same, the central&#xD;
      line is to be placed into the right internal jugular vein when required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To begin the trial and whilst the patient is spontaneously breathing, a physical examination&#xD;
      of the right JVP will be performed. A central line will be inserted with the patient awake&#xD;
      into the right internal jugular vein. Left-sided ultrasound of JVP and Central Venous&#xD;
      Pressure (CVP) will be measured using the right-sided catheter will be recorded&#xD;
      simultaneously. The tip of the catheter attached to the transducer (which is zeroed to the&#xD;
      reference point) will be placed at the point of venous collapse, identified by&#xD;
      ultrasonography, to identify if the JVP and CVP match. The tip of the catheter will then be&#xD;
      placed at the angle of Louis. Measurement of the pressure difference between the angle of&#xD;
      Louis and the reference point will identify if this value shows variability compared to&#xD;
      previous approximations of 5cm above the right atrium. With the patient anaesthetised and&#xD;
      mechanically breathing, left JVP and CVP will be measured once more. Twenty-four hours&#xD;
      post-surgery, ultrasound of the JVP and CVP will be measured with the patient breathing&#xD;
      spontaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physical JVP examination will be recorded from the opposite side to the central venous&#xD;
      catheter. The bed will be adjusted to an angle between 30 and 60 degrees, that most clearly&#xD;
      identifies the collapsing vein. Differentiation between the JVP and the carotid pulse must be&#xD;
      distinguished. Tangential lighting using a flashlight should be used to correctly identify&#xD;
      and note the apex of the jugular venous pulsations. Recordings will be taken at&#xD;
      end-expiration allowing the vertical distance between the venous meniscus and phlebostatic&#xD;
      axis to be measured. JVP will be measured in millimetres of water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound recordings will be made using the SonoSite ultrasound probe by Sam Jenkins. The&#xD;
      equipment and gels required are used routinely on site and will be supplied by Sheffield&#xD;
      Teaching Hospitals. The SonoSite probe will be calibrated prior to each use, based on the&#xD;
      recommendations of the manufacturer. The angle of the bed is kept constant and the patient&#xD;
      will remain in the same position following the physical JVP examination. Ultrasound gel will&#xD;
      be applied, again on the opposite side to the central venous catheter. Locating the area of&#xD;
      venous collapse will be identified following visualisation from both longitudinal and&#xD;
      transverse planes. The apex of venous collapse at end-expiration will be marked using the&#xD;
      longitudinal view. Corroboration of the correct position of the probe by looking at the&#xD;
      transverse view will be performed prior to marking of venous collapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CVP will be measured once the central venous catheter has been zeroed. The reference point of&#xD;
      the transducer will be placed at the 4th intercostal space, mid-axillary line. The bed should&#xD;
      still be kept at a constant angle for this measurement. The mean of the 'a' wave upon&#xD;
      end-expiration will be taken. Converting the CVP from millimetres of mercury to millimetres&#xD;
      of water will allow direct comparison to prior findings of JVP.&#xD;
