  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic ring fractures in the geriatric population are a rising problem for surgeons in&#xD;
      industrialized countries. Many of these low-energy fractures are treated nonoperatively;&#xD;
      however, pain is a significant factor in recovery of these patients and often inhibits their&#xD;
      ability to mobilize. Most of these fractures are lateral compression type 1 injuries which&#xD;
      are defined as an impaction to the sacrum with varying amounts of anterior/pubic root/rami&#xD;
      fractures. Many of these patients in the geriatric population suffer from osteoporosis and&#xD;
      the injuries are often sustained from a low-energy mechanism like a fall. The tenet of&#xD;
      treatment for all osteoporotic fractures is early mobilization. It is well known that&#xD;
      extended periods of bed rest will lead to pneumonia, decubitus ulceration, deep venous&#xD;
      thrombosis, and, in the case of the pelvis, not prevent subsequent deformity. Calcitonin is a&#xD;
      polypeptide containing 32 amino acids, and it plays a role in the regulation of bone&#xD;
      metabolism as a hormone that prevents bone resorption. Intranasal salmon calcitonin (ISC) has&#xD;
      been demonstrated to decrease pain and improve the level of activity in patients with acute&#xD;
      vertebral osteoporotic compression fractures when administered within the first 5 days of&#xD;
      onset of pain/injury. It has also demonstrated an immediate post analgesic effect in&#xD;
      osteoporotic distal radius fractures treated nonoperatively. The antihyperalgesic action of&#xD;
      calcitonin appears to be mediated by serotonin receptors. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the analgesic effect of ISC on geriatric patients with pelvic ring injuries who are&#xD;
      treated nonoperatively.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Baseline: Treatment group will be prescribed 200IU of ISC daily for a period of 3 months. The&#xD;
      control group will not be prescribed calcitonin. Participants will complete research only&#xD;
      Iowa pelvis score questionnaire, SF-36 questionnaire and visual analogue scale (VAS) to&#xD;
      assess subjective pain and function. Two-week follow up visit post discharge: participants&#xD;
      will complete Iowa pelvis score questionnaire, SF-36 questionnaire and VAS to assess&#xD;
      subjective pain and function. Participants will be referred for a standard of care DEXA bone&#xD;
      density scan if they have no previous diagnosis of osteoporosis and no history of previous&#xD;
      scan within a year. Six weeks post discharge: participants will complete Iowa pelvis score&#xD;
      questionnaire, SF-36 questionnaire and VAS to assess subjective pain and function.&#xD;
      Participants will undergo standard of care radiographic analysis of pelvic ring injury with&#xD;
      AP/inlet and outlet pelvic x-rays 4. Twelve weeks post discharge: Participants will complete&#xD;
      Iowa pelvis score questionnaire, SF-36 questionnaire and VAS to assess subjective pain and&#xD;
      function. Participants will undergo standard of care radiographic analysis of pelvic ring&#xD;
      injury with AP/inlet and outlet pelvic x-rays - Participants will perform a timed up and go&#xD;
      (TUG) test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent is obtained, all patients who meet eligibility criteria will be&#xD;
      randomized into one of two groups. Randomization will be achieved by numbering 50 sealed&#xD;
      white envelopes (25 control, 25 treatment). There is no blinding to the randomization. It&#xD;
      would be difficult to blind the participants, or the research personnel. We do not believe&#xD;
      there will be any significant bias that can be corrected with blinding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment: 200IUof ISC daily for a period of 3 month&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control: Will not be prescribed calcitonin (ISC)&#xD;
