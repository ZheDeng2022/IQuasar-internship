  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to examine the effects of a novel, orally consumed dietary&#xD;
      supplement (composed of naturally occurring components) on weight management and metabolic&#xD;
      rate in individuals who are overweight or obese following a 12-week supplementation period.&#xD;
      The investigator's primary outcome will be changes in body composition measured via dual&#xD;
      energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), which will measure changes in fat and lean mass during the&#xD;
      supplementation period. Another primary objective will be to determine whether or not the&#xD;
      body mass index (BMI) changes during the supplementation period. A secondary objective of the&#xD;
      study is to determine whether anthropometric measurements (waist-to-hip ratio) is altered&#xD;
      following the supplementation period. Another secondary objective of this study is to&#xD;
      determine whether metabolic rate (as measured in VO2 consumption at rest and during exercise)&#xD;
      is changed following the supplementation period. Another secondary objective is to determine&#xD;
      whether blood pressure (systolic and diastolic pressure, measured in mm Hg) and physical&#xD;
      function (measured via VO2peak in mL/min/kg-1 and leg strength in kilograms) change when the&#xD;
      supplement is administered over a 12-week period. Another secondary objective will determine&#xD;
      how glycemic control, blood markers of inflammation and cholesterol are affected by this&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

      The present study is a randomized double-blind placebo controlled repeated measures design,&#xD;
      with sampling of the cohorts on five separate occasions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Intervention Group (n = 24) Healthy, overweight or obese physically inactive males,&#xD;
      supplement, n = 12 Healthy, overweight or obese physically inactive females, supplement, n=12&#xD;
      Group 2: Placebo Group (n = 24) Healthy, overweight or obese physically inactive males, no&#xD;
      supplement, n = 12 Healthy, overweight or obese physically inactive females, no supplement,&#xD;
      n=12&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to make 5 visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 0 (Visit 1): Eligible participants that provided informed consent will complete a medical&#xD;
      screening questionnaire to determine their readiness to perform exercise. Participants will&#xD;
      thus complete the SF-36 and CSEP Get Active Questionnaire form. Participant characteristics&#xD;
      will then be measured. At this time, anthropometric measurements (i.e., height, weight, waist&#xD;
      circumference) and a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurement will be performed.&#xD;
      This must be done in order to verify that the participant meets the inclusion criteria of&#xD;
      being overweight. Following this screening, participants will begin the following the study&#xD;
      timeline.Upon completion, participants will be randomized into one of two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1 (Visit 2): Participants will arrive following an overnight fast (including no caffeine&#xD;
      for 12 hours) and having abstained from any exercise for the prior 48 hours. Participants&#xD;
      will enter the clinic, and rest quietly in the supine position for 25 minutes before having&#xD;
      blood pressure with a non-invasive automated cuff and resting metabolic rate via metabolic&#xD;
      cart measured. Following resting blood pressure and baseline metabolic rate assessment, blood&#xD;
      will be drawn from an antecubital vein. Thereafter, functional metrics will be determined&#xD;
      including strength (both upper and lower body muscles; and aerobic capacity (V02peak).&#xD;
      Following testing, participants will be provided with a 3-day diet log (which will be&#xD;
      completed every two weeks) and a pedometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 14 (Visit 3); Participants will arrive following an overnight fast (including no caffeine&#xD;
      for 12 hours) and having abstained from any exercise for the prior 24 hours. Participants&#xD;
      will undergo a DXA. Blood will be drawn from an antecubital vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 49 (Visit 4); Participants will arrive following an overnight fast (including no caffeine&#xD;
      for 12 hours) and having abstained from any exercise for the prior 24 hours. Participants&#xD;
      will undergo a DXA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up - Day 7, 21, 28, 35, 42, 56, 63, 70, 77: Participants will receive a weekly phone&#xD;
      call to determine their pedometer counts for the week, and to ensure that participants are&#xD;
      adhering to the supplement consumption, and to address any concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 84 (Visit 5); Participants will repeat Day 1 (automated blood pressure, resting and&#xD;
      maximal metabolic rate, blood draw, functional metrics. Participants will return their&#xD;
      pedometer and remuneration will be processed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study products (active supplement vs. placebo) will be provided in a blinded fashion by&#xD;
      Infinit Nutrition Canada (Windsor, Ontario). The active supplement is composed of vitamins,&#xD;
      minerals and naturally occurring and plant extracts approved for consumption. Participants&#xD;
      will be asked to consume 3 servings of the study product per day (7 days per week) throughout&#xD;
      the 12-wk intervention period. Participants will consume 1 serving immediately before&#xD;
      breakfast. Participants will be instructed to consume the supplement in a single sitting,&#xD;
      with water, within 5-10 min. Participants will be instructed to record product intake in a&#xD;
      diary to check compliance. Participants will also be asked to maintain the used package and&#xD;
      turn it in at the check-ins as a marker of study compliance. To maintain the double-blind&#xD;
      nature of the experiment, the placebo, which contains microcrystalline cellulose, will be&#xD;
      matched in size, appearance, taste and caloric value&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three day weighed food record. Participants will be asked to record everything that they&#xD;
      consumed for 3 non-consecutive days: 2 week-days and either a Saturday or a Sunday. On&#xD;
      completion of the food record, it will be analyzed using a commercially available&#xD;
      computerized database software (Nutribase version 11.5, Cybersoft Inc., Phoenix, AZ, USA).&#xD;
      Food items will be aggregated into the following categories: fruit (e.g., fresh/frozen,&#xD;
      tinned, juice), vegetables (e.g., fresh/frozen, canned), dairy products (e.g., milk, yoghurt,&#xD;
      cheese), breads and cereals (e.g., bread, breakfast cereal, rice, pasta), meats and&#xD;
      alternatives (e.g., red meat, poultry, fish, pork, processed meat, tofu, eggs, nuts) and&#xD;
      extra foods (e.g., hamburger, pizza, meat pies, chocolate, cake, ice cream, jam, biscuits,&#xD;
      crackers, crisps, alcohol etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resting metabolic rate (RMR). Participants will be asked to lay still on a bed will connected&#xD;
      to a metabolic cart with an on-line gas collection system (Moxus modular oxygen uptake&#xD;
      system, AEI Technologies, Pittsburgh, PA), and the system will acquire oxygen consumption&#xD;
      (VO2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) production data for 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling. A total of ~16 mL blood per visit will be taken from the antecubital vein and&#xD;
      drawn into evacuated tubes with heparin used for plasma collection and non-treated tubes will&#xD;
      be used to collect serum. Blood sampling will be used for the following panel of tests:&#xD;
      complete blood count (CBC), glucose, Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT), bilirubin, Alanine&#xD;
      Aminotransferase (ALT), creatine kinase (CK), creatinine, triglycerides, total cholesterol,&#xD;
      LDL and HDL, insulin, CRP, and leptin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximal voluntary VO2peak fitness test. Participants will complete double-leg incremental&#xD;
      peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) tests on a cycle ergometer (Lode, Groningen, the Netherlands). A&#xD;
      metabolic cart with an on-line gas collection system (Moxus modular oxygen uptake system, AEI&#xD;
      Technologies, Pittsburgh, PA) will acquire oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide (CO2)&#xD;
      production data. For double-leg cycling, the test will begin with a 1-min warm up at 50 watts&#xD;
      (W), after which the power will be increased by 1 W every two seconds until volitional&#xD;
      exhaustion or the point at which pedal cadence falls below 60 rpm. Heart rate will be&#xD;
      monitored continuously throughout the test via telemetry with a heart rate monitor (Polar A3,&#xD;
      Lake Success, NY). VO2peak will be defined as the highest oxygen consumption achieved over a&#xD;
      30-s period. Maximal workload (Wmax) will be the highest power output achieved during the&#xD;
      test. After the completion of the test, the participant will be asked to perform a 2-3-minute&#xD;
      active recovery pedaling against no resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pedometer. Participants will be given a wearable activity tracker (pedometer). All&#xD;
      participants will record their daily totals for subsequent analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and blood pressure. A DXA scan is a non-invasive procedure&#xD;
      requiring the participant to only lay still on a padded table. It is a fast procedure that&#xD;
      provides a variety of body composition variables (bone mass/area/density, fat mass, and fat&#xD;
      free mass). The DXA scan exposes individuals to low levels of radiation, approximately 0.18&#xD;
      millirem. According to the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Americans receive&#xD;
      approximately 620 millirem each year, half of which is due to environmental background&#xD;
      radiation. Radiation exposure can be due to medical treatments or procedures, like X-Ray or&#xD;
      MRI's, food, sun exposure, etc. Any exposure to radiation can increase the risk of cancer. In&#xD;
      the present study, body composition will be assessed using DXA scan (GE Lunar Prodigy,&#xD;
      Madison, WI) and a software program for adults (encore Version 9.15.010). Fat free mass&#xD;
      (FFM), fat mass (FM) and bone mineral density (BMD) of the entire body will be recorded.&#xD;
      Arterial blood pressure (i.e., systolic [SBP] and diastolic [DBP]) will be measured during&#xD;
      rest with a stethoscope (Marshall Nurse Stethoscope, Riverside, Ill., USA) and&#xD;
      sphygmomanometer (MDF Instruments Direct Inc., Agoura Hills, Calif., USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Waist and hip circumference measures. For waist circumference measurement, the participant&#xD;
      will stand with arms at the sides, feet together, and abdomen relaxed. Using a Gulick tape&#xD;
      measure, a horizontal measure will be taken at the narrowest part of the torso (above the&#xD;
      umbilicus and below the xiphoid process). Obtaining a horizontal measure directly above the&#xD;
      iliac crest enhances standardization according to The National Obesity Task Force. For hip&#xD;
      circumference measurement, the participant stands erect and feet together, a horizontal&#xD;
      measure is taken at the maximal circumference of buttocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leg press 1RM. Assessment procedures for determining lower body strength using leg press&#xD;
      exercise equipment (Cybex Eagle ®, Medway, MA) will require the participant to sit in the leg&#xD;
      press machine with the right foot and left foot on the weight platform. The seat and back pad&#xD;
      will be adjusted so that feet are flat on the platform hip-width apart, toes slightly angled&#xD;
      out, and legs parallel to each other. The interviewer will then instruct the participant to&#xD;
      grasp the handles or sides of the seat and extend their legs leaving just a slight bend in&#xD;
      the knee. Next, the participant will remove the racking mechanism from the platform and grasp&#xD;
      the handles or seat again. The participant will begin with a selected weight that is within&#xD;
      their perceived ability, approximately 60 to 80% of maximum capacity (make an educated&#xD;
      guess). The participant will lower the platform slowly and controlled towards the chest,&#xD;
      keeping the hips and buttocks on the seat, and the back flat against the back pad. Once the&#xD;
      thighs are parallel to the platform the participant will extend the legs, pushing the weight&#xD;
      back to the start position as hard and as fast as possible. The participant will be&#xD;
      instructed to not allow their hips to shift to one side, the buttocks to rise, or knees to&#xD;
      move inward or outward during this exercise. The interviewer will also instruct the&#xD;
      participant to keep heels flat and not allow the knees to go beyond the toes. Once the&#xD;
      repetitions are completed, the participant will replace the racking mechanism and exit the&#xD;
      leg press. These procedures were adapted from procedures described by the National Strength&#xD;
      and Condition Association (2008) and the American College of Sports Medicine (2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hand grip strength (MVIC; maximum voluntary isometric contraction). Hand grip strength will&#xD;
      be measured using an isometric dynamometer (JAMAR®, Sammons, Bolingbrook, IL). The grip width&#xD;
      will be adjusted to hand size and with arm flexed at 90°, the participant will perform three&#xD;
      X 5 s efforts with a one min rest between trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knee extension (MVIC;maximum voluntary isometric contraction). Isometric knee extension will&#xD;
      be measured by mechanical dynamometry (Biodex System 3, Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY).&#xD;
      Participants will be positioned into the machine with the knee flexed at 90° and perform&#xD;
      three X 5s maximal voluntary contractions with 30s rest between each trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires. The RAND 36-Item Health Survey (Version 1.0) taps eight health concepts:&#xD;
      physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role&#xD;
      limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning,&#xD;
      energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions. It also includes a single item that provides&#xD;
      an indication of perceived change in health. The Get Active Questionnaire by CSEP is a&#xD;
      2-page, self-administered, pre-participation for exercise screening tool. Potential&#xD;
      participants must answer 'no' to all questions on the Get Active Questionnaire.&#xD;
