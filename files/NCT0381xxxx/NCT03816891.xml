    <textblock>
      Study of the efficacy, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      Vixarelimab (KPL-716) in subjects with prurigo nodularis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2a/b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to investigate the&#xD;
      efficacy, safety, tolerability, PK and immunogenicity of Vixarelimab administered&#xD;
      subcutaneously (SC) in subjects with prurigo nodularis experiencing pruritus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2a portion (completed):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty-nine subjects with moderate to severe PN experiencing moderate to severe pruritus were&#xD;
      treated in the Phase 2a portion of the study. At Baseline, subjects were randomized 1:1 to&#xD;
      receive double-blind Vixarelimab or placebo: Vixarelimab 720 mg loading dose followed by 360&#xD;
      mg every week; Placebo loading dose followed by placebo every week. The treatment Period was&#xD;
      8 weeks or 16 weeks (treatment duration was reduced from 16 weeks to 8 weeks in a protocol&#xD;
      amendment [Protocol Version 3]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2b portion (enrolling):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase 2b study (Figure 1) will consist of a 4-week Screening Period and a 16-week&#xD;
      Double-Blind Period, followed by a 36-week Open-Label-Extension (OLE) Period. Approximately&#xD;
      180 subjects with PN, experiencing severe pruritus, will be randomized (at 1:1:1:1 ratio)&#xD;
      into one of 4 arms (3 active arms and one placebo arm). A total of 4 doses of study drug will&#xD;
      be administered during the Double-Blind Period to measure the efficacy, safety, and PK of&#xD;
      Vixarelimab. After the Double-Blind Period, all subjects will have the option to receive&#xD;
      Vixarelimab during the OLE Period to evaluate the long-term safety and PK.&#xD;
