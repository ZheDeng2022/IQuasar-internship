      This is for a &quot;Single Patient Expanded Access&quot; of an on-going study (IRB#2017-3526). In the&#xD;
      on-going study, the maximum number of subject will be 35 subjects (35 eyes) will be implanted&#xD;
      with the KeraKlear device and will be followed for one year. However, this expanded access is&#xD;
      for single patient use below is a description of patient condition and circumstances&#xD;
      necessitating treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      88 year old female with 2 previous failed corneal transplants, had significant scarring and&#xD;
      mild edema, surface well epithelialized, has potential for 10 letters of improvement in&#xD;
      visual acuity. Patient is high risk for recurrent corneal rejection and failure and therefore&#xD;
      would not be a candidate for standard corneal transplant. She would potentially do well with&#xD;
      a partial thickness artificial cornea such as the KeraKlear.&#xD;

      For this &quot;Single Patient Expanded Access&quot; the research procedures will be based on the Master&#xD;
      Protocol Version #1.2 dated 18Dec2017, with one foreseen deviation. Section 7.1 Page 27 under&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria #1 Male or female from 22 years to 80 years of age at screening study&#xD;
      visit. This patient is 88 years old as of the submission of this Protocol Narrative to the&#xD;
      IRB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperatively, subject will be examined at (with window size in parentheses):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 Day (+2 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 Week (7±2 days)&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Corneal blindness where cornea transplantation is necessary but is expected to be&#xD;
             unsuccessful due to severe limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD) associated with aniridia&#xD;
             or due to multiple (two or more) failed cornea transplantation surgeries and&#xD;
             spontaneous visual improvement without surgical intervention is not expected or&#xD;
             probable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Best Corrected Distance Visual Acuity (Snellen) which is equal or worse than 20/200 in&#xD;
             the study eye (but at least light perception with projection)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Estimated visual potential of the study eye is greater than or equal to at least two&#xD;
             lines visual improvement of BCDVA of current vision in the study eye.&#xD;
