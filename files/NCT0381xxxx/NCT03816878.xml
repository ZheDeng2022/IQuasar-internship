  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of inactivated subunit&#xD;
      H5N1 influenza vaccine in individuals who have previously received live attenuated H2N2,&#xD;
      H6N1, or H9N2 influenza vaccine, as well as in individuals who have never previously received&#xD;
      H5N1 or other pandemic live attenuated influenza vaccines.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of inactivated subunit H5N1 influenza&#xD;
      vaccine in individuals who have previously received live attenuated H2N2, H6N1, or H9N2&#xD;
      influenza vaccine, as well as in individuals who have never previously received H5N1 or other&#xD;
      pandemic live attenuated influenza vaccines (pLAIVs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled in two cohorts. Cohort 1 will include participants who received&#xD;
      two doses of live attenuated H2N2, H6N1, or H9N2 influenza vaccine during a prior Center for&#xD;
      Immunization Research (CIR) study; Cohort 2 will include participants who have never&#xD;
      previously received a pLAIV. Participants in both cohorts will receive one dose of H5N1 pISV&#xD;
      vaccine by injection at Day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend study visits on Days 0, 7, 14, 28, 56, 90, and 360. Study visits may&#xD;
      include a physical examination, medical history, and blood and urine collection. All&#xD;
      participants will be followed for approximately 360 days after receiving the H5N1 pISV&#xD;
      vaccine.&#xD;
