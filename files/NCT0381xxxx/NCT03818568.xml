  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators intend to analyze diets restricted in protein and supplemented with&#xD;
      ketoanalogues of essential amino acids, to slow the progress of renal damage and improve&#xD;
      nutritional status in diabetic patients over 60 years with stage 4 chronic kidney disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evey 2 months, evaluations were performed of renal function (creatinine clearance, serum&#xD;
      cysteine, proteinuria) and nutritional status (subjective global evaluation,dominant had&#xD;
      pressure strength, body composition by bioelectric impedance, serum transferrin, serum&#xD;
      prealbumin and serum aminogram) for a follow-up period of 2 years.&#xD;

      Design. A multicenter, controlled, randomized, open label clinical trial was performed in&#xD;
      patients with T2DM in CKD stage 3b-4 (GFR &lt;44 to &gt;15 mL/min/1.73 m2) treated in hospitals of&#xD;
      the Mexican Social Security Institute. The follow-up period was at least 1 year from the&#xD;
      inclusion of the last patient. The study was conducted in accordance with the provisions of&#xD;
      the Declarations of Helsinki and Tokyo with the amendments in Venice (1983). The protocol was&#xD;
      approved by the National Research and Ethics Committee and by the Research Committees of all&#xD;
      participating hospitals and was registered in National Clinical Trials (NCT03818568).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients. Inclusion criteria: Adult patients with T2DM (&gt;18 years) of either sex, with stage&#xD;
      3b-4 of CKD. All patients gave their signed informed consent at the time of recruitment.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Previous treatment with KA, kidney transplantation, cancer, HIV-AIDS, or&#xD;
      seropositive for hepatitis B or C, patients receiving immunosuppressors, with hypercalcemia,&#xD;
      intolerance to KA or disorders of amino acid metabolism. Patients who lost social security&#xD;
      during the study, changed address or treating physician were also excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size. Sample size calculation was made on the basis of two independent groups with&#xD;
      unequal variances, α=0.05, β=0.20, and assuming a difference of 4.0 mL/min/yr between groups&#xD;
      in reduction of eGFR, lower in LPD+KA. Calculation was made with sample size software. A&#xD;
      minimum of 51 per group was obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention. Diet design. Energy: 35 kcals/kg of ideal body weight in patients with normal&#xD;
      BMI; 30 kcals/kg of ideal body weight in overweight patients (BMI&gt;25 kg/m2) and 40 kcals/kg&#xD;
      of ideal weight in underweight patients (BMI&lt;25 kg/m2). Lipids accounted for 35% of the total&#xD;
      energy intake (2/3 from polyunsaturated fatty acids). Carbohydrate intake was set at 55-60%&#xD;
      of the total energy intake, with &gt;70% of complex carbohydrates. The fiber content was 20-25 g&#xD;
      per day. The dietary recommendation for sodium chloride was ~5 g daily and potassium 50-60&#xD;
      mEq/day. Phosphate intake was set at 800-1000 mg per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups were prescribed with PrI of 0.6 g/kg/day, preferably plant-based. Patients in&#xD;
      LPD+KA group received KA (Ketosteril® (Fresenius Kabi, Deutschland GMBH, BadHomburg, Germany)&#xD;
      according to the manufacturer's recommendations (1 tablet/5 kg of body weight divided into 3&#xD;
      doses). All other treatments were provided according to institutional guidelines and&#xD;
      prescribed by and according to the criteria of the treating physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization. Patients were centrally randomized 1:1 using an electronic system of random&#xD;
      numbers generator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes. The primary outcome was: the rate of decline in kidney function (Δ eGFR/year).&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes included: start of dialysis, impairment of nutritional status, adverse&#xD;
      events, hospitalizations, and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up. Patients were followed-up with scheduled visits every two months, for clinical and&#xD;
      biochemical evaluation. Blood samples were obtained after an overnight fast, serum and plasma&#xD;
      were separated and kept in frozen aliquots (-70 °C) until assay. The 24 h urine volumes were&#xD;
      recorded and frozen aliquots stored (-70 °C) until assay. In total blood, hemoglobin,&#xD;
      hematocrit, and glycated hemoglobin were measured, and in plasma/serum: glucose, urea,&#xD;
      creatinine, albumin, total proteins, triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol,&#xD;
      calcium, phosphorus, C-reactive protein. In 24-hour urine: urea and creatinine. Serum&#xD;
      Cystatin-C was measured at baseline and months 6, 9 and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements of biochemical parameters were performed on automated equipment using routine&#xD;
      techniques. High sensitivity C-reactive protein and Cystatin-C were measured by&#xD;
      immunoturbidimetry (Diazyme's Cystatin C Assay. Poway, CA, USA). The protein nitrogen&#xD;
      appearance normalized by body weight (nPNA) was calculated with the Maroni formula, GFR was&#xD;
      calculated using formulas based on sCr (eCKDCr), and serum Cystatin C (eGFRCysC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutritional evaluations. The patients were evaluated by Nephrology Nutritionists. Nutritional&#xD;
      status was monitored by body weight, body mass index, subjective global assessment, body&#xD;
      composition analyzed by electrical bioimpedance, and biochemical parameters. As a functional&#xD;
      index, the hand grip force was measured with a dynamometer. Treatment adherence was monitored&#xD;
      by the 24-hour food intake questionnaire and/or the 3-day food intake diary, nPNA was also&#xD;
      used. In the intervention group, adherence to the use of KA was evaluated by counting tablets&#xD;
      and packaging at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis. Data are presented as means and standard deviations or standard errors&#xD;
      and as percentages or frequencies according variable characteristics. Differences between&#xD;
      groups were analyzed with Chi2 test, or Student´s t test. For calculation of decline of GFR&#xD;
      during follow-up, only actual eGFR data were considered, and two-way analyses of variance&#xD;
      used. For analysis of the effect of concomitant medication, differences in slopes of&#xD;
      regression lines of eGFR over time among users and non-users of specific medication were&#xD;
      used. Differences in distribution of adverse events was analyzed with Chi2 and&#xD;
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. All statistical calculations were made with wSPSS v19 package.&#xD;
