  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1/2 study of a drug called Ixazomib in combination with cytotoxic&#xD;
      chemotherapy consisting of Vincristine, Dexamethasone, Asparaginase, and Doxorubicin (VXLD).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The phase 1 study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the PO formulation,&#xD;
      followed by a screening phase 2 study to investigate the efficacy of ixazomib in combination&#xD;
      with chemotherapy in children with relapsed ALL and lymphoblastic lymphoma (LLy). The single&#xD;
      arm, screening phase 2 design will allow us to use a minimal number of patients to obtain&#xD;
      preliminary information about treatment efficacy. Discovering a safe and tolerable dose of&#xD;
      ixazomib in a PO formulation and the preliminary efficacy data will significantly increase&#xD;
      the possibility of ixazomib moving forward in frontline pediatric treatment protocols in both&#xD;
      intense chemotherapy courses and maintenance courses.&#xD;
