      An Open-Label Phase II Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Neoadjuvant Neratinib&#xD;
      Followed by Weekly Paclitaxel and Carboplatin Plus Neratinib in Early Stage Triple-Negative&#xD;
      Breast Cancer Patients Who Exhibit Enhanced HER2 Signaling by Live Cell HER2 Signaling&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single arm, open label, interventional study designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with a pan-HER inhibitor in patients with&#xD;
      ER-/PR-/HER2-(triple-negative) invasive breast cancer who have abnormal HER2-driven signaling&#xD;
      activity determined by the Celcuity CELx HER2 signal function (HSF) test. Patients will be&#xD;
      required to have a prescreening research core needle biopsy to procure a fresh tumor specimen&#xD;
      that will be sent to Celcuity for CELx HSF testing, in order to assess the status of their&#xD;
      HER2-driven signaling activity (abnormally or normally active). While waiting for results of&#xD;
      the CELx HSF test, patients may receive the first dose of weekly paclitaxel at the&#xD;
      investigator's discretion. Patients whose CELx HSF test indicate they have abnormal&#xD;
      HER2-driven signaling activity will then receive neratinib as a single agent daily for 21&#xD;
      days and then neratinib plus paclitaxel and carboplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study is to evaluate whether patients with triple-negative breast&#xD;
      cancers (estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptors &lt; 10%; HER2-negative per standard&#xD;
      ASCO/CAP testing criteria), but with abnormal HER2-driven signaling pathways determined by&#xD;
      the Celcuity CELx HSF assay, and who receive HER2-targeted therapy with neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy will have a higher rate of pathological complete response (pCR) in the breast&#xD;
      and lymph nodes (pCR breast and lymph nodes) than has been found historically in patients&#xD;
      with triple-negative breast cancer who have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints include pathologic complete response (breast), clinical complete response (cCR),&#xD;
      residual cancer burden (RCB) 0-1 index, and relationship between quantitative CELx score and&#xD;
      pCR rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that approximately 135 patients will need to be prescreened in order to enroll&#xD;
      27 patients who have abnormal HER2-driven signaling activity.&#xD;

             study if liver imaging (CT, MRI, PET-CT, or PET scan) performed within 6 weeks prior&#xD;

             requirements in criterion 4.2.13 are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with alkaline phosphatase that is &gt; ULN but ≤ 2.5 x ULN or unexplained bone&#xD;
             pain are eligible for inclusion in the study if a bone scan, PET-CT scan, or PET scan&#xD;
             performed within 6 weeks prior to initiating chemotherapy does not demonstrate&#xD;
             metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine performed within 6 weeks prior to initiating chemotherapy must be ≤&#xD;
             1.5 x ULN for the lab.&#xD;

             method of contraception during therapy, and for at least 7 months after the last dose&#xD;
