  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is defined as a non-progressive lesion of the immature brain. Children&#xD;
      with CP may present with a variety of motor impairments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impaired upper limb function of children with cerebral palsy (CP) limits and restricts&#xD;
      participation in activities of daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kinesio Taping (KT) is commonly used in sport injuries, in neurology and oncology patients&#xD;
      following the surgical protocols, and for pediatric rehabilitation to reduce pain, facilitate&#xD;
      or inhibit muscle activity, prevent injuries, reposition joints, aid the lymphatic system,&#xD;
      support postural alignment, and improve proprioception. Kinesiotaping is a treatment that has&#xD;
      not been studied much and can be applied in cerebral palsy. The tapes were grouped as elastic&#xD;
      and rigid. In fact, there has been a few studies that investigates the effect of upper&#xD;
      extremity elastic kinesiotaping. High methodological studies about its efficacy in this&#xD;
      population are rare.&#xD;

      34 Children with cerebral palsy aged between 6-18 applied to Dokuz Eylül Üniversity Medical&#xD;
      School Hospital Physical Medicine ve Rehabilitation Department will be included the study.&#xD;
      Patients have diagnosed as CP with the subgroup of diplegic, hemiplegic, tetraplegic and&#xD;
      mixt. The upper extremity side will be chosen as the affected side for the hemiplegic CP's&#xD;
      and for diplegic, tetraplegic CP's the side of upper extremity which children have been used&#xD;
      to but have obstacles in daily life. The chosen upper extremity side will be taped with the&#xD;
      functional correction technique on the dorsum of the hand and forearm by clinician. Patients&#xD;
      will be taped at least 2-3 hours a day every day and they will be also recomended dealing&#xD;
      with the grasping and releasing activities in daily living at about 2-3 hours a day. In a way&#xD;
      that every patient has to be the control of themselves, 1 week before kinesiotaping,&#xD;
      immediately after kinesiotaping and 1 week after the period of kinesiotaping patients will be&#xD;
      evaluated with box and block test, nine hole peg test, modified house clasification score and&#xD;
      the active/passive wrist dorsiflexion range of motion. The investigator will also note the&#xD;
      gross motor function clasification system level, dominant hand side and affected side, for&#xD;
      chosen upper extremity side's zancolli clasification, modified aschwort scale of wrist and&#xD;
      hand fingers, manual ability clasification system level for every patient.&#xD;
