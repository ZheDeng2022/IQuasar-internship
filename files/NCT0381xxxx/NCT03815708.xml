      The aim of the study is to study the thermoregulatory responses under real life conditions,&#xD;
      such as during wheelchair rugby and basketball matches. A further goal is to develop and&#xD;
      validate a standardised field-based protocol, which induces the same thermoregulatory&#xD;
      response as during a wheelchair rugby and basketball match. This knowledge allows to&#xD;
      investigate strategies to reduce heat stress and to enhance exercise performance (e.g.&#xD;
      pre-cooling) in the future, based on standardised conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A spinal cord injury leads to several physiological changes and complications, which might&#xD;
      influence exercise performance (Perret and Abel, 2016). One major problem is the limited&#xD;
      thermoregulation, especially in subjects suffering from a tetraplegia (Griggs et al., 2015;&#xD;
      Price et al., 2006). There are only few studies, which investigated the thermoregulatory&#xD;
      response during real life conditions in wheelchair athletes such as during a wheelchair rugby&#xD;
      match (Griggs et al., 2017). However, to implement strategies to reduce heat stress (e.g.&#xD;
      precooling methods) or to determine the influence of heat stress on exercise performance and&#xD;
      to determine the effects of specific interventions the following two issues seem to be a&#xD;
      prerequisite: First of all, we need to understand, which thermoregulatory response is induced&#xD;
      under real life conditions, e.g. by a wheelchair rugby or basketball match. Second, if we&#xD;
      want to study the effects of potential interventions, a standardised and reliable study&#xD;
      protocol has to be available, which closely mimics match conditions and induces a similar&#xD;
      amount of heat stress. Thus, the aim of the study is to measure thermoregulatory and physical&#xD;
      performance outcomes during a real life wheelchair rugby and basketball match. A further goal&#xD;
      is to develop and validate a standardised field-based protocol, which induces a similar&#xD;
      thermoregulatory response as during a wheelchair rugby or basketball match. These knowledge&#xD;
      builds the basis for future thermoregulatory studies based on a reliable and standardised&#xD;
      field-based testing protocol.&#xD;
