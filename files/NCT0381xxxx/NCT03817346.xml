  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study does not target any disease or condition in itself, but is evaluating the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single oral doses of GT-002 in the setting of healthy&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A longer-term objective is to apply the findings from this study to design and later conduct&#xD;
      a clinical development programme of GT-002 as a medication to treat schizophrenia.&#xD;

             with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside of the reference range&#xD;
             for the population being studied may be included at the investigator´s discretion&#xD;
             provided the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors, jeopardize&#xD;
             study integrity, or to interfere with the study assessments or procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects must be willing to use condom or other contraceptive methods with a failure&#xD;
             rate of &lt; 1% and refrain from donating sperm from the date of dosing until one month&#xD;
             after last dosing.&#xD;

             opinion of the investigator, may either put the subject at risk because of&#xD;
             participation in the study, or influence the results or the subject's ability to&#xD;
             participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of any type of cancer.&#xD;

             weeks of the administration of investigational product that is likely to introduce&#xD;
             additional risk factors, jeopardize study integrity, or to interfere with the study&#xD;
             assessments or procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Any clinically significant abnormalities in clinical chemistry, haematology,&#xD;
             coagulation or urinalysis results at the time of screening visit as judged by the&#xD;

&#xD;
         15. Current smokers or users of nicotine products. Irregular use of nicotine (e.g.&#xD;
             smoking, snuffing, and chewing tobacco) up to five doses per week is allowed before&#xD;
             screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
