  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prior research suggests that sedentary behavior is detrimental to health, independent of&#xD;
      exercise activity. Sedentary behavior is defined as behaviors that involve low levels of&#xD;
      energy expenditure â‰¤1.5 metabolic equivalents (including sitting, watching TV, reading, and&#xD;
      driving). Due to the high burden of sedentary behaviors in modern-day societies, this has&#xD;
      potential implications for novel intervention strategies to reduce sitting (outside of&#xD;
      regular exercise activity) and improve health. In addition, the modern workplace fosters&#xD;
      sedentary behavior, and sedentary jobs now make up more than 80% of the workforce. The goal&#xD;
      of this project is to implement interventions to reduce sedentary behavior at work and&#xD;
      evaluate their impact on physiologic parameters and markers of disease. Specifically, the&#xD;
      investigators/study team will use direct measurement of vascular endothelial function as one&#xD;
      of our outcomes. This is important since conduit artery endothelial function, assessed by&#xD;
      arterial flow-mediated dilation (FMD), is a powerful indicator of vascular inflammation and&#xD;
      predictor of future cardiovascular events.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that obese subjects with sedentary jobs at the Medical College of&#xD;
      Wisconsin, when assigned use of a standing desk to encourage movement, will reduce their&#xD;
      daily sedentary time and demonstrate improvement in physiologic parameters and disease&#xD;
      markers from baseline through the end of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior intervention studies are limited and not randomized, but have shown a reduction in&#xD;
      waist circumference and improvements in cholesterol when overall sitting time is reduced over&#xD;
      a 3-6 month interval (with a standing or treadmill desk). None of these intervention studies&#xD;
      have directly measured vascular endothelial function, as assessed by arterial flow-mediated&#xD;
      dilation (FMD), an early indicator of cardiovascular disease, and a powerful predictor of&#xD;
      future cardiovascular events and vascular inflammation. Improvements in arterial FMD (or&#xD;
      endothelial function) are known to reduce the future risk of cardiovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to differences in the energy requirement of lying down, sitting, and standing, there has&#xD;
      been increased research interest in activity type classification based on posture. In the&#xD;
      science of sedentary behaviors, this is an important distinction to consider when evaluating&#xD;
      health outcomes, such as in the present study. Accelerometers (physical activity monitors)&#xD;
      utilize piezoelectric crystal sensor technology to provide a measure of accelerations of the&#xD;
      body during movement and have the advantage of capturing frequency, duration, and intensity&#xD;
      of physical movement minute by minute. Accelerometer technology will be used to analyze the&#xD;
      primary outcome of interest (sedentary time). The study team will collect information on&#xD;
      standing time, sedentary bouts, daily steps, cadence (walking speed in steps/minute), and&#xD;
      exercise activity. The study team will employ a compact and re-usable physical activity&#xD;
      monitor that adheres to the subject's thigh. This will provide objective assessments of&#xD;
      activity levels at baseline and during the intervention. This data can be translated into&#xD;
      energy expenditure or activity intensity categories (METs) and even position (sitting verses&#xD;
      standing). The monitor output is Excel-compatible and is ideal for comparing each subject's&#xD;
      activity and physiological parameters from baseline to intervention.&#xD;
