      Enuresis is the scientific term for bedwetting. Modern research has established three&#xD;
      pathogenic mechanisms as crucial:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Excessive urine production at night (nocturnal polyuria).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Detrusor over activity. The bladder may contract regardless of whether it is full or&#xD;
           not.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Difficulties to arouse from sleep and will not wake up when the bladder is full or&#xD;
           contracts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with daytime incontinence usually suffer from detrusor over activity and many of&#xD;
      them are constipated. The reason for this connection is probably partly anatomical;&#xD;
      constipated children have to use the rectum as a storage space, and the chronically distended&#xD;
      rectum will compress the bladder from behind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The link between constipation and enuresis (as opposed to daytime incontinence) is less clear&#xD;
      although it is logically plausible. Our experience is that some enuretic children become dry&#xD;
      at night just by treatment of constipation, but this is yet not supported by sufficient&#xD;
      evidence The standard primary treatment of enuresis - as reflected by global consensus&#xD;
      guidelines - rests upon three pillars. The recommended first step is 1) bladder advice. The&#xD;
      next step, if the child is still wet at night, is either 2) the antidiuretic drug&#xD;
      desmopressin or 3) the sleep-modifying enuresis alarm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The underlying idea behind basic bladder advice is that the child is taught to more actively&#xD;
      take command over the bladder by voiding according to a regular daytime schedule, using&#xD;
      correct voiding posture and spread fluid intake evenly across the day. The rationale behind&#xD;
      the recommendation of this strategy is that is the established cornerstone of the treatment&#xD;
      of daytime incontinence and that detrusor over activity is a pathogenic factor common to both&#xD;
      conditions. By influencing bladder, function during the day it is assumed that nocturnal&#xD;
      bladder function will also normalize. The problem is a glaring lack of evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary aims with this study is to better understand which roles basic bladder advice,&#xD;
      constipation therapy and/or the enuresis alarm play in the first-line therapy of enuresis.&#xD;

      Treatment strategies in nocturnal enuresis&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND. Enuresis is the scientific term for bedwetting. Approximately one in ten children&#xD;
      in early school age suffers from this condition. Modern research has established three&#xD;
      pathogenic mechanisms as crucial:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Excessive urine production at night (nocturnal polyuria). The bladder is filled to&#xD;
           capacity before the night is over.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Nocturnal detrusor overactivity. In these cases, the bladder may contract regardless of&#xD;
           whether it is full or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Almost all children with enuresis are difficult to arouse from sleep and will not wake&#xD;
           up when the bladder is full or contracts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless of which of the above factors is relevant in the individual child, the condition&#xD;
      is often inherited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All enuretic children do not wet their beds every night, but even children who experience wet&#xD;
      nights sporadically may be very much bothered by their condition - they may, for instance,&#xD;
      not dare to participate in school camps or sleepovers. Many of the children also suffer from&#xD;
      concomitant daytime incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enuresis is not, as previously thought, primarily a psychiatric disorder. It has psychiatric&#xD;
      consequences, but only rarely psychiatric causes. Enuretic children, as group, have lower&#xD;
      self-esteem than their dry peers, and their quality of life is also negatively affected.&#xD;
      Another link between the bladder and the psychological wellbeing of the child is that, for&#xD;
      unclear reasons, enuresis (as well as daytime incontinence) is overrepresented among children&#xD;
      with neuropsychiatric disturbances such as ADHD, and vice versa. These considerations make&#xD;
      the successful treatment of enuresis extra important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      THE BLADDER-BOWEL LINK. It is well established that children with daytime incontinence&#xD;
      usually suffer from underlying detrusor overactivity and that many of them are constipated.&#xD;
      Treatment of daytime incontinence in these children will usually only be successful if the&#xD;
      constipation is also treated. The reason for this connection is probably partly anatomical;&#xD;
      constipated children have to use the rectum as a storage space, and the chronically distended&#xD;
      rectum will compress the bladder from behind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The link between constipation and enuresis (as opposed to daytime incontinence) is less clear&#xD;
      although it is logically plausible. Our experience is that some enuretic children become dry&#xD;
      at night just by treatment of constipation, but this is as yet not supported by sufficient&#xD;
      evidence. We neither know how common constipation is among enuretic children, nor how&#xD;
      important this, when present, is to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLINICAL EVALUATION OF THE ENURETIC CHILD. Children who seek medical attention for&#xD;
      uncomplicated enuresis usually do not need any complicated or invasive evaluation. No blood&#xD;
      samples need to be taken and no radiological or urodynamic examinations are motivated. A&#xD;
      nurse with a basic knowledge of pediatric bladder problems best evaluates children. If you&#xD;
      know how to ask, the right questions the very few children with enuresis due to serious&#xD;
      underlying conditions will easily be found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bladder diary plays a crucial role in the evaluation of children with bladder problems.&#xD;
      By writing down how often and how much urine the child voids during a few days, and by&#xD;
      assessing nocturnal urine production via the weighing of diapers or sheet covers, important&#xD;
      information is gained regarding bladder and kidney function during day and night. Additional&#xD;
      relevant information is provided if the family documents wet and dry nights, as well as bowel&#xD;
      movements, during two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT. The standard primary treatment of enuresis - as reflected by global consensus&#xD;
      guidelines - rests upon three pillars. The recommended first step is 1) bladder advice, or&#xD;
      basic bladder advice. The next step, if the child is still wet at night, is either 2) the&#xD;
      antidiuretic drug desmopressin or 3) the sleep-modifying enuresis alarm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The underlying idea behind basic bladder advice is that the child is taught to take command&#xD;
      over the bladder by voiding according to a regular day-time schedule, using correct voiding&#xD;
      posture and spread fluid intake evenly across the day. The rationale behind the&#xD;
      recommendation of this strategy is that is the established cornerstone of the treatment of&#xD;
      daytime incontinence and that detrusor over activity is a pathogenic factor common to both&#xD;
      conditions. By influencing bladder function during the day it is assumed that nocturnal&#xD;
      bladder function will also normalize.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The problem is a glaring lack of evidence. We do not know that daytime bladder training has&#xD;
      any influence at all on nocturnal enuresis. And the therapy, although completely harmless,&#xD;
      demands lots of nursing time and family commitment. We recently performed the first ever&#xD;
      randomised, controlled study of basic bladder advice in enuretic children and found no&#xD;
      effect. However, these results need to be further explored and confirmed before we know if&#xD;
      the global recommendations should be changed. Furthermore, during our completed study the&#xD;
      therapy was given during four weeks only and all participating children suffered from&#xD;
      frequent enuresis (i.e. enuresis occurring &gt;50% of the nights). Thus, we still do not know&#xD;
      whether the treatment will help if it is given during a longer period or if children with&#xD;
      infrequent enuresis do have a beneficent effect of the therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Desmopressin is taken at bedtime and, being an analogue to human vasopressin, decreases&#xD;
      nocturnal urine production. It helps 30-50% of enuretic children to achieve dry nights as&#xD;
      long as it is taken but has only limited, if any, curative effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enuresis alarm is a device that gives off a strong alarm signal every time there is urine&#xD;
      in the bed. The method is well-established and has a clearly curative effect in more than&#xD;
      half of the children who use it, even though the therapeutic mechanism is slightly unclear.&#xD;
      Presumably, the use of the alarm either influences sleep and arousal mechanisms so the child&#xD;
      wakes up to void or learns to semi consciously inhibit nocturnal detrusor contractions; in&#xD;
      both cases, the enuresis disappears. The main problem with the alarm is that it demands a&#xD;
      high degree of motivation and compliance by the child and it may take months until full&#xD;
      effect is achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In spite of these strategies, many enuretic children, perhaps 25%, are therapy-resistant. For&#xD;
      these children, who have experienced only failures, the burden and associated psychosocial&#xD;
      risks are extra high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROGNOSTIC INDICATORS Since different enuretic children have different causes behind their&#xD;
      bedwetting they will also respond differently to therapies. Much would be won if we could&#xD;
      choose correct therapy for the individual child at the first try.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that desmopressin is likely (although not certain) to be beneficial if the&#xD;
      bladder diary shows that the nocturnal urine production is high and the daytime voided&#xD;
      volumes (volumes per micturition) are normal. However, prognostic indicators for alarm&#xD;
      response are much less studied - which is frustrating, given the high amount of work required&#xD;
      for this therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We may presume that family motivation and the ability to follow instructions are&#xD;
      prognostically favourable indicators, but this assumption has never been properly tested.&#xD;
      There are some studies indicating that the alarm works best for children with frequent&#xD;
      enuresis but it is unclear whether factors such as nocturnal urine production, daytime&#xD;
      micturition habits, or indeed anamnestic data, give any prognostic information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the above background, it is clear that there are several questions that need to be&#xD;
      answered if a better, individualized and cost-effective enuresis therapy is to be achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY AIMS To better understand which roles basic bladder advise, constipation therapy&#xD;
      and/or the enuresis alarm play in the first-line therapy of enuresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is constipation more common among enuretic children than normal controls?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In enuretic children with constipation, how large effect against the enuresis has&#xD;
           treatment of the constipation?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do easily acquired data from the bladder diary give prognostic information as regarding&#xD;
           the antienuretic effect of basic bladder training and/or the alarm?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do children with infrequent enuresis respond differently to therapy than those who wet&#xD;
           their beds most nights?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Which therapy is perceived as most cumbersome for the families - basic bladder advice or&#xD;
           the enuresis alarm? METHODS PROJECT I - ENURESIS AND CONSTIPATION. All patients and&#xD;
           controls visit the study nurse. They are asked a number of questions concerning bladder&#xD;
           and bowel habits and undergo non-invasive urodynamic examination, i.e. they empty their&#xD;
           bladder on the uroflow toilet and have any residual urine (urine left in the bladder&#xD;
           after voiding) detected via ultrasound. Ultrasound is also used to assess the diameter&#xD;
           of the rectum just behind the bladder. These procedures are all part of the routine&#xD;
           evaluation of children with bladder issues and involve no violation of privacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nurse then supplies the family with a bladder diary, which is to be completed at home.&#xD;
      The following data is gathered:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wet and dry nights during two weeks (only patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nycturia (awake voiding's at night) during two weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Voided volumes at each voiding during two days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fluid intake during two days and nights&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weighing of diapers or sheet covers during three nights (only patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bowel movements during two weeks In addition to this the nurse notes the completeness of&#xD;
           the data and how long it takes for the family to return the bladder diary; i.e. the&#xD;
           family's motivation and ability to comply with the instructions is also assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enuretic children who have shown signs/symptoms of constipation (infrequent bowel movements,&#xD;
      faecal incontinence or a rectal diameter &gt;30 mm) will be given standard laxative therapy and&#xD;
      their enuresis will be reassessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECT II - RANDOMIZED COMPARISON BETWEEN BASIC UROTHERAPY, THE ENURESIS ALARM AND NO&#xD;
      TREATMET All enuretic children who completed project I and still suffer from enuresis -&#xD;
      including those who have been given treatment for constipation but did not become dry - will&#xD;
      be invited to take part in the randomised study. The participants will be randomised into&#xD;
      three groups. Regardless of group all children will be given information about bladder&#xD;
      function and enuresis pathogenesis, and all ongoing laxative therapy will continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children will be randomized in to tree groups, &quot;basic bladder advise&quot;, &quot;alarm&quot; or &quot;no&#xD;
      treatment&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A. Basic bladder advice is given in accordance with international guidelines. A&#xD;
           qualified pediatric nurse/ urotherapist give the treatment during 8 weeks. Contact by&#xD;
           phone is given in week 2 and 6. During the last two weeks (week 7 and 8) wet and dry&#xD;
           nights are again documented. At the end of treatment the family grades the level of&#xD;
           workload and disruption that the treatment has incurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B. Alarm therapy according to international guidelines. Contact by phone is given&#xD;
           after in week 2 and 6. During the last two weeks (week 7 and 8) wet and dry nights are&#xD;
           again documented. At the end of treatment the family grades the level of workload and&#xD;
           disruption that the treatment has incurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group C. These children are given no active treatment. During the last two week, 7 and 8&#xD;
           wet and dry nights are again documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless of which therapy has been given (or not given) the children who still wet their&#xD;
      beds after completion of project II will be given an appointment to the pediatric outpatient&#xD;
      ward for further treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPLICATIONS AND RELEVANCE Through the results of this project we believe that first-line&#xD;
      treatment for a very large number of enuretic children will be improved, simplified and&#xD;
      rationalized. The impact will be international and global treatment recommendations may be&#xD;
      changed.&#xD;
