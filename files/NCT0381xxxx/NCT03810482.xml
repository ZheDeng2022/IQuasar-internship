  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Concordance between walking tests and pedometer data may seem like a logical outcome for&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension (PH) patients. However, many individuals have discordant results:&#xD;
      results much worse or better during an in-hospital walking test as compared to real life&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is: to determine variables associated with discordance&#xD;
      between the distance walked during an in-hospital 6-minute walking test (6MWT) and the&#xD;
      average distance travelled per day (observed over a period of 28 days (2 Ã— 14 days) using a&#xD;
      pedometer) among PH patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Secondarily, the discordance between 6MWT results versus total pedometer recorded distance&#xD;
      and versus maximum daily pedometer-recorded distance will be similarly studied. The aim of&#xD;
      the study is also to search for variables associated with progression free survival. The&#xD;
      relationships between pedometer data and self-reported dyspnea variation will be studied.&#xD;
      Factorial analysis may be used to study the overall view of variable correlations and patient&#xD;
      similarity/dissimilarity.&#xD;

    <description>Linear regression is performed for the distance walked during an initial 6 minute walking test (6MWT) and the average distance walked per day according to the pedometer intervention. The residuals from this regression will determine categories:&#xD;
Category 1 (pedometer high): the 25% of subjects not in category 2 and with higher values for pedometer data&#xD;
Category 2 (concordance): the 50% of included subjects with the smallest residuals in terms of absolute value.&#xD;
Category 3 (6MWT high): the 25% of subjects not in category 2 and with higher values for 6MWT data</description>
