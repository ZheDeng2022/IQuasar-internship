      This research study will collect blood and tumor tissue samples from patients with soft&#xD;
      tissue sarcoma to look at circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). When tumor cells are&#xD;
      damaged or die, DNA from the tumor cells are released into the blood stream as the cells&#xD;
      break down. This is called circulating tumor DNA. Circulating tumor DNA is an important&#xD;
      biomarker that may be used in cancer detection, prediction of treatment response, and disease&#xD;
      monitoring.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are continually looking for ways to understand the biology of cancer such as&#xD;
      sarcoma, and ways to improve cancer care and patient outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research has shown that changes in some genes and/or proteins, called biomarkers, may be&#xD;
      important indicators for certain cancers and response to treatments. Genes are molecules made&#xD;
      up of ribonucleic acid (RNA) and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). DNA contain instructions for&#xD;
      the development and functioning of the cells in the body and are passed down from parent to&#xD;
      child. RNA is involved with producing proteins in the body. Further research is needed to&#xD;
      better understand the changes found in cancer cells and what this means for certain&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Circulating tumor DNA is an important biomarker that may be used in cancer detection,&#xD;
      prediction of treatment response and disease monitoring. When tumor cells are damaged or die,&#xD;
      DNA from the tumor cells are released into the blood stream as the cells break down. This is&#xD;
      called circulating tumor DNA. Researchers are looking for better ways to detect circulating&#xD;
      tumor DNA so that it can be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine how feasible it is to detect circulating tumor DNA&#xD;
      in blood samples of soft tissue sarcoma patients and whether there is a connection between&#xD;
      circulating tumor DNA and the likelihood of patients' disease coming back after they receive&#xD;
      treatment. To do this, blood and tumor tissue samples will be collected from participants and&#xD;
      will undergo DNA testing (reading the contents of their DNA, called sequencing). The results&#xD;
      of the DNA testing in the blood samples will be compared with the results from DNA testing&#xD;
      that will also be done on tumor tissue. The results will also be compared with participant's&#xD;
      response to their treatment, recurrence, and/or long term survival.&#xD;
