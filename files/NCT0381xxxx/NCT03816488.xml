      Hypothesis: In surgical patients with type 2 diabetes, taking either metformin or salsalate&#xD;
      on the morning of surgery will reduce the incidence of hyperglycemia, inflammation and even&#xD;
      surgical site infections, without any obvious patient risk relative to patients given a&#xD;
      placebo control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia and surgery induce a number of metabolic disturbances, particularly among patients&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes (T2D). This includes altered glucose metabolism and hyperglycemia, which&#xD;
      is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, including an increase in surgical&#xD;
      site infections (SSI). Although insulin protocols can reduce blood glucose levels in&#xD;
      hyperglycemic surgical patients, leading to reduced SSI, this has caused severe hypoglycemia&#xD;
      in a number of patients. Instead, the use of simple and effective interventions, such as&#xD;
      continuing metformin on the day of surgery, could represent an important step toward reducing&#xD;
      the incidence of these morbid outcomes while improving glucose control. Alternatively,&#xD;
      salsalate, a non-acetylated dimer of salicylic acid, has also emerged as a novel&#xD;
      glucose-lowering medication that also possesses important anti-pyretic and anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      properties and could prove equally effective.These refinements may also reduce SSI and&#xD;
      inflammation. If the proposed pilot trial, to continue metformin, or take salsalate,&#xD;
      peri-operatively, is as safe and easy as the investigators anticipate it will allow for the&#xD;
      planning of a future definitive randomized clinical trial. The aims of this pilot trial are&#xD;
      to assess the feasibility of safely continuing metformin, or taking salsalate on the day of&#xD;
      surgery, with the goal of reducing the incidence of hyperglycemic events. This includes&#xD;
      assessing our ability to recruit patients, adhere to the proposed study protocol, assess&#xD;
      workload,and measure the desired outcomes, all of which are crucial for the planning of a&#xD;
      subsequent clinical trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This internal pilot study (n=36) is designed as a 3-arm, parallel, placebo-controlled trial&#xD;
      with block randomization. All parties will be blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Recruitment: Patients with T2D on metformin presenting to the Hamilton Health&#xD;
      Sciences (HHS) preoperative clinic for elective surgery requiring general anesthetic will be&#xD;
      screened for eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: 36 patients over the 1-year study. This sample size will allow for 3 groups of&#xD;
      12, which permits block randomization and precise confidence interval (CI) calculations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and Allocation: Patients will be randomized on the day of their pre-operative&#xD;
      assessment by our department statistician using a computer-generated table, with an&#xD;
      allocation ratio of 1:1:1 in random permuted blocks of 3 or 6. Only the pharmacist and&#xD;
      statistician will know the allocation sequence. Concealed medications (over-encapsulated)&#xD;
      will be provided to the RC upon confirming the allotment with a unique identification number&#xD;
      (UIN), recorded on the patient-specific case record form (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Application of Intervention: Our intervention involves self-administered metformin (patient's&#xD;
      usual dose) vs. salsalate (1.5g) vs. placebo with sips of water 2h prior to surgery. Baseline&#xD;
      data (age, height, weight, ASA score, mean arterial BP, and baseline glucose) will be&#xD;
      collected by the RC in the pre-operative assessment area, and flash glucose sensors&#xD;
      (FreeStyle Libre, Abbot) will be placed on the upper arm as per manufacturer's instructions&#xD;
      and readings collected by the RC. Study data will be securely stored in the anesthesia&#xD;
      research office, McMaster University. Standard monitors will be used in the operating room,&#xD;
      with any additional monitoring left to the anesthesiologist's discretion. Although most&#xD;
      anesthetics appear to modify glucose metabolism, general anesthesia will be provided in their&#xD;
      preferred manner (including dexamethasone administration for post-operative nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting prophylaxis) to improve generalizability. Details of the type of drugs, fluids and&#xD;
      blood loss will be recorded. Following surgery, patients will be brought to the PACU for&#xD;
      routine monitoring (30-60 min), and additional blood samples will be drawn. Subsequent&#xD;
      samples will be collected on the evening of surgery (6-12h) and POD1. Any episodes of hyper-&#xD;
      or hypoglycemia will be managed routinely at the treating physician's discretion and details&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements of Inflammation: Blood and urine samples will be collected on the morning of&#xD;
      surgery, upon admission to PACU, and will coincide with other tests to minimize needle&#xD;
      sticks. Blood samples will be processed at the HHS Core Research Laboratory and divided into&#xD;
      3 serum and 2 EDTA aliquots, barcoded and stored in liquid nitrogen. Urine samples will be&#xD;
      divided into 2 barcoded aliquots and stored in liquid nitrogen. This will allow for future&#xD;
      analysis and characterization of biochemical pathways related to the surgical stress&#xD;
      response. These future analyses will include measurement of insulin and proinsulin since&#xD;
      salsalate may modify their endogenous metabolism. Similarly, the investigators eventually&#xD;
      plan to measure various inflammatory markers implicated in the development of acute&#xD;
      stress-induced insulin resistance (i.e. IL-6, TNFα, and hsCRP), which could provide insight&#xD;
      into potential beneficial effects of salsalate or metformin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility Outcomes: The primary feasibility outcomes include calculating the recruitment&#xD;
      rate (both the percentage of individuals who were approached in the pre-operative clinic that&#xD;
      enrolled in the study, and the total number of individuals that were recruited each month&#xD;
      (Table 1, supplemental document). The ability to follow study protocol will be reported as&#xD;
      the percentage of individuals who were able to complete the study protocol as a fraction of&#xD;
      the total number of individuals recruited for i) drug administration and blinding, ii) blood&#xD;
      sampling at specified times, and iii) reliability of CGM by comparison with laboratory&#xD;
      glucose values. Workload will be calculated per patient, and safety profile assessed by&#xD;
      recording adverse events. Together, this may identify pitfalls requiring modification prior&#xD;
      to a full RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis and Feasibility: Reporting and analysis will conform to the CONSORT&#xD;
      pilot and feasibility trials guidelines (www.consort-statement.org). Data will be collected&#xD;
      using an encrypted online tool (RedCap, Research Electronic Data Capture) hosted at McMaster.&#xD;
      To be feasible and continue onto a subsequent RCT the investigators will need to recruit at&#xD;
      least 3 patients per month. Additionally, the investigators seek an adherence rate of 88.9%&#xD;
      (32/36) to receive study drug, collect more than 90.3% (130/144) of pre-specified blood&#xD;
      samples, and ensure 83.3% (30/36) patients have been followed up within 6 weeks of their&#xD;
      procedure to document any complications (e.g. SSI). If targets prove difficult, then our&#xD;
      protocol will be reevaluated for possible amendments that will not compromise final outcomes.&#xD;
      Given this is a pilot, CIs will be calculated for outcomes of interest: rates of&#xD;
      hyperglycemia, SSI, and degree of inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Management: This pilot trial will be conducted at HHS. The trial will enlist support&#xD;
      and collaboration from surgeons and fellow anesthesiologists. Study data will be securely&#xD;
      stored at the anesthesia research office, McMaster University. An RC will be employed for&#xD;
      patient recruitment and data collection. The CRFs for study patients will be randomly&#xD;
      cross-checked for completeness and accuracy. All reports of incorrect randomizations,&#xD;
      protocol violations or incomplete data will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk Assessment: This trial does not entail any higher risk to the patient than the present&#xD;
      standard of care. It is pragmatic, and uses clinically acceptable doses with a safe profile.&#xD;
