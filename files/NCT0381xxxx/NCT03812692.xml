  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep apnea (OSA) is a condition in which the air passage in the throat closes or partly&#xD;
      closes during sleep and repeatedly interrupts breathing. The standard treatment for sleep&#xD;
      apnea is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), but it is not suitable for all patients.&#xD;
      Another treatment is to use an oral appliance in your mouth when you sleep. The appliance&#xD;
      covers the upper and lower teeth and acts to pull the lower jaw forward, opening the throat&#xD;
      passage and allowing normal breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral appliance therapy does not treat sleep apnea effectively in everyone. In order to&#xD;
      identify the people in whom oral appliance therapy will work, Zephyr Sleep Technologies has&#xD;
      invented a feedback-controlled device that tests various positions of the lower jaw. This&#xD;
      commercially available device, known as MATRx plus, is a Health Canada approved and FDA&#xD;
      cleared motorized dental positioner that can be used in an overnight sleep study performed in&#xD;
      the home. Temporary dental impression trays cover your upper and lower teeth. These are&#xD;
      attached to a small motor that slowly and gently pulls your lower jaw forward under the&#xD;
      control of a computer in response to real-time breathing events. The commercial MATRx plus&#xD;
      device uses measures of airflow from a nasal cannula and blood oxygen saturation from a pulse&#xD;
      oximeter to guide the movement of the lower jaw during the test. Though the test is accurate,&#xD;
      the equipment can be somewhat cumbersome to apply. The purpose of the study is to validate a&#xD;
      simplified version of the test that requires fewer sensors and sleep time.&#xD;

      the equipment can be somewhat cumbersome to apply. The purpose of the study is to validate a&#xD;
      simplified version of the test that requires fewer sensors and sleep time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have previously carried out three research studies leading to the development of the&#xD;
      feedback-controlled mandibular positioner. These studies, two of which used early prototypes&#xD;
      of the device and one that used the commercial MATRx plus device, showed that the&#xD;
      feedback-control software used was very accurate and was able to identify successful&#xD;
      candidates in a home setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No serious or permanent problems or risks were identified in any of the previous research&#xD;
      studies. Participants reported minor tooth and gum discomfort on the morning following the&#xD;
      test and other minor issues including dry mouth, excessive saliva, and being unable to sleep.&#xD;
      The previous studies have established the safety and efficacy of the device using a device&#xD;
      prototype. The purpose of the present study is to determine if the efficacy of the device is&#xD;
      maintained when fewer sensors are used and the requirement for sleep time is reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will collect data over one night in a sleep laboratory and a series of nights in&#xD;
      the home. Following the study, you will be told if you are a suitable candidate for oral&#xD;
      appliance therapy. If you do not already have a custom oral appliance, one will be provided&#xD;
      to you. During the study, the Principal Investigator and study dentist will be blinded to the&#xD;
      results of your tests. In the event of an emergency, the Principal Investigator can be&#xD;
      unblinded to your test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 46 individuals will be recruited for this study. Study participants will need to attend&#xD;
      visits at multiple centres located in Calgary, Alberta.&#xD;

Not all participants will be predicted responders to oral appliance therapy; both predicted responders and non-responders will undergo an outcome home sleep apnea test with a custom oral appliance in place to validate the prediction made by the test. Twenty participants will also complete an in-lab sleep study prior to the home study.</description>

    <description>The MATRx plus device is a feedback-controlled mandibular positioner that uses data collected during sleep to control movement of the mandible in real-time using a mandibular positioner. The test provides a prediction of the individual's response to oral appliance therapy; i.e., if the individual can treat his or her obstructive sleep apnea using a mandibular advancing oral appliance. For individuals predicted to respond to the therapy, the test also provides a mandibular position at which the appliance will be effective.</description>
