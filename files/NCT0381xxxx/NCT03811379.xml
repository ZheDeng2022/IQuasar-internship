  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the anti-tumor activity, safety and tolerance of toripalimab as monotherapy for&#xD;
      patients with small cell esophageal cancer (SCCE), and to explore the potential biomarkers&#xD;
      for this treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      For the first time in the world, the investigators revealed the genomic characteristics of&#xD;
      SCCE and constructed a complete genomic profile of SCCE. The analysis of transcriptome data&#xD;
      showed that the number of effector T cells in SCCE immune microenvironment was significantly&#xD;
      higher than that of other cancers, and NK cells were relatively high. Macrophages in SCCE&#xD;
      mainly showed M2-like phenotype and maintained at a relatively high level, suggesting the&#xD;
      possibility of immunotherapy in SCCE treatment. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      clarify the efficacy of PD-1 antibody in the treatment of patients with SCCE who failed&#xD;
      chemotherapy, so as to provide a basis for further large-scale clinical research.&#xD;
