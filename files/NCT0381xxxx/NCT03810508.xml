  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth 4J (CMT4J) is a rare inherited peripheral neuropathy often characterized&#xD;
      by rapidly progressive, asymmetrical upper and lower extremity weakness, muscle atrophy&#xD;
      leading to loss of ambulation, respiratory compromise and premature death with no available&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical characteristics and natural clinical&#xD;
      progression of symptoms in individuals with CMT4J. This natural history study is important to&#xD;
      better understand disease course to be able to determine clinically meaningful outcome&#xD;
      measures for use in future clinical trials.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) diseases are the most common inherited motor and sensory&#xD;
      neuropathies, composed of a group of pathologically and genetically distinct subtypes ranging&#xD;
      from slowly to rapidly progressive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMT4J is a rare subtype of CMT caused by mutations in the FIG4 gene. Pediatric-onset disease&#xD;
      can often be characterized by rapid progression of muscle weakness and atrophy, culminating&#xD;
      in loss of ambulation and respiratory compromise and premature death. Adult-onset CMT4J can&#xD;
      present with a more variable disease course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No prospective natural history study for CMT4J has been reported. This study aims to&#xD;
      prospectively investigate the natural history of CMT4J, and concurrently to identify&#xD;
      potential outcome measures that could be used in future clinical trials. No investigational&#xD;
      product will be provided in the study.&#xD;
