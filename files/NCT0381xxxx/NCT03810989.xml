      Using sweat as the vehicle for removing molecules normally excreted in the&#xD;
      urine(dermodialysis) was identified some decades ago.The study will include 66 ESRD patients&#xD;
      and 20 CKD stage 5 patients not on dialysis who met inclusion and exclusion criteria. The&#xD;
      ESRD patients will be divided into three groups and will be subjected to different modalities&#xD;
      of stimulation of sweating like infra-red sauna , physical exercise and hot bath. The study&#xD;
      will be conducted over a period of three months. During the ﬁrst month, patients were&#xD;
      dialyzed as usual (control phase).During the next two months ,the participants will be&#xD;
      dialysed twice weekly in addition to dermodialysis. S Cr, BUN, serum K and serum phosphorus&#xD;
      will be measured weekly immediately before the last dialysis session during the control and&#xD;
      intervention phases. The mean of this investigations during each phase will be calculated .&#xD;
      The investigators will compare the mean of this investigations during control phase with the&#xD;
      mean during the intervention phase to evaluate the effectiveness of dermodialysis as adjuvant&#xD;
      therapy for ESRD patients.The patients not on dialysis will subjected to infra-red sauna and&#xD;
      hot bath.The investigators also will compare the means of S Cr, BUN, serum K and serum&#xD;
      phosphorus during both control and intervention phases like the ESRD patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although dialysis has been considered as a life-saving treatment for end stage renal disease&#xD;
      (ESRD) patients, many ESRD patients in developing countries don't have access to dialysis&#xD;
      facilities . Using sweat as the vehicle for removing molecules normally excreted in the&#xD;
      urine(dermodialysis) was identified some decades ago. Sweat fluid mainly contains sodium&#xD;
      chloride, potassium, urea, ammonia, uric acid, and creatinine. The mean sweat fluid urea&#xD;
      concentration could reach 5.5 to 50 times the serum concentration . In particular, urea&#xD;
      concentrations in human sweat are persistently elevated in uremic patients . The 24-hour&#xD;
      urinary urea excretion in summer was as much as one-quarter of the quantity in winter in&#xD;
      uremic patients, indicating the compensatory urea excretion in sweat gland fluid .This high&#xD;
      level of urea and other toxic molecules crystallize out and deposit visibly on the skin when&#xD;
      the water of the sweat evaporates off ('uremic frost') .Sweat K concentration was&#xD;
      significantly higher in ESRD patients . Pruijm, El-Housseini et al reported that stimulated&#xD;
      sweating can be an effective way to reduce intradialytic weight gain(IDWG) in hemodialysis(&#xD;
      HD)patients. These findings indicated that dermodialysis can be used to delay the requirement&#xD;
      for and to reduce the frequency of dialysis and to improve the quality of lives of ESRD&#xD;
      patients especially in the developing World where economic and technical support barriers to&#xD;
      the provision of dialysis are present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sweating can be stimulated by many methods like physical exercise ,saunas and drugs like&#xD;
      pilocarpine. Traditional dry saunas use temperatures as high as 185 to 195 degrees F, which&#xD;
      is too much for some patients to tolerate. Infrared saunas use a much lower temperature (120&#xD;
      to 150 degrees F). However, because the heat of infrared saunas travels much deeper into the&#xD;
      body, they are able to cause a more vigorous sweat at lower temperature. Infrared sauna has&#xD;
      many benefits like normalizing blood pressure , treating congestive heart failure, weight&#xD;
      loss and relieving of chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Head out water immersion was used many times in ESRD patients. Pruijm, El-Housseini et al&#xD;
      concluded that immersion in hot bath (temperature 37-43C) was effective method of stimulating&#xD;
      sweating and reducing IDWG. Intradialytic hypotension could be prevented by water immersion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:- Evaluation of feasibility of dermodialysis as adjuvant replacement&#xD;
      therapy for ESRD patients to decrease the cost of dialysis facilities (one third of the total&#xD;
      cost).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Improve uremic pruritus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Better control of blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Decrease interdialytic weight gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Comparing the effectiveness of infra-red sauna, exercise and combination of infra-red&#xD;
           sauna and head out water immersion as modality of dermodialysis The study will include&#xD;
           66 ESRD patients and 20 CKD stage 5 patients not on dialysis who met inclusion and&#xD;
           exclusion criteria. The ESRD patients will be subdivided into three group, each group&#xD;
           will include 22 patients .Each group will be subjected to Detailed history and Careful&#xD;
           examination. The study will be conducted over a period of three months(for each&#xD;
           patient). During the ﬁrst month, patients will be dialyzed as usual (control phase).&#xD;
           Detailed information on blood pressure, interdialytic weight gain (IDWG), and dialysis&#xD;
           prescription will be recorded. S Cr, BUN, serum K and serum phosphorus will be measured&#xD;
           weekly immediately before the last dialysis session for one month and the mean will be&#xD;
           calculated. During the next two months the patient will be dialysed twice weekly on&#xD;
           Saturday and Wednesday. during the in-between three days(Sunday, Monday and Tuesday) the&#xD;
           three groups subjected to intervention as the following :- Group 1:-three session of&#xD;
           infra-red sauna of 15 minutes duration separated by ten minutes rest outside the sauna.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2:-three session of physical exercise of 20-30 minutes duration separated by 10 minutes&#xD;
      rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3:-three session of infra-red sauna as the first group then the patients will be&#xD;
      immersed up to neck for one hour in water at 37-43 C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed information on IDWG, blood pressure, any improvement in uremic pruritus will be&#xD;
      recorded. Body temperature before and after the intervention will be measured and recorded.&#xD;
      Assessment of uremic pruritus according to verbal rating scale (VRS) which divided into four&#xD;
      level:-0=no symptom, 1=mild, 2= moderate, 3=sever or intense symptom. Dialysis prescription&#xD;
      and diet will be fixed as possible to be similar to the control phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      S Cr, BUN, serum K and serum phosphorus will be measured weekly immediately before the last&#xD;
      dialysis session (Wednesday) for two months and the mean will be calculated. The patients&#xD;
      will be admitted in internal medicine department in the dialysis free period to be under&#xD;
      close observation. Dialysis will be done if there is urgent indication in the dialysis free&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CKD group :- The patients will be subjected to Detailed history and Careful examination.&#xD;
      The study will be conducted over a period of three months. During the ﬁrst month (control&#xD;
      phase), S Cr, BUN, serum K and serum phosphorus will be measured weekly and the mean will be&#xD;
      calculated. During the next two months the patient will be subjected to three session of&#xD;
      sauna of 15 minutes duration separated by ten minutes rest outside the sauna then the&#xD;
      patients will be immersed up to neck for one hour in water at 37 -43 C . Body temperature&#xD;
      before and after the intervention will be measured and recorded. During the intervention&#xD;
      phase, S Cr, BUN, serum K and serum phosphorus will be measured weekly and the mean will be&#xD;
      calculated. During the period of rest the patients will consume sufficient amount of water to&#xD;
      avoid dehydration .Blood pressure will be monitored and recorded. Dialysis will be done if&#xD;
      there is urgent indication or standard indication for dialysis according to KDOQI guide lines&#xD;
      2015.&#xD;
