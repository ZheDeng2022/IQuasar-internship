  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To measure and quantify the postprandial glucose variations in response to a meal in the&#xD;
      healthy 6-12 months old child and correlate this response with the composition of this meal.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      14 full-term infants (boys and girls) aged six to twelve months and fed a diversified diet&#xD;
      including infant formula, solid foods such as mixed meat and vegetable preparation or&#xD;
      marketed preparations will be recruited. Children will be recruited in the Lausanne Childrens&#xD;
      hospital and only be included in the study whenin good general health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FreeStyle® Libre Pro Interstitial Glucose Meter will be applied on the last day before&#xD;
      discharge from the hospital after skin preparation with anesthetic cream (Emla®) during&#xD;
      hospitalization and measurements will be recorded during 2-5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not intended to measure capillary or venous blood glucose levels during this study.&#xD;
      However, if blood is collected during hospitalization, blood glucose will be measured in&#xD;
      parallel with the interstitial glucose measured with the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The child will follow his usual diet without modifications. The amount of food consumed by&#xD;
      the child as well as the length of the meals will be recorded by the parents. For meals made&#xD;
      by the parents they will be asked to keep a sample not seen to analyze their carbohydrate&#xD;
      content. The total carbohydrate content will be measured .&#xD;
