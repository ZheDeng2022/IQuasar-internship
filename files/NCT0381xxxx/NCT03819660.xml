    <textblock>
      This open-label, long term safety study is designed to evaluate the safety of amifampridine&#xD;
      phosphate in ambulatory patients diagnosed SMA Type 3 over an extended period. The study is&#xD;
      planned to include approximately 12 male and female SMA Type 3 patients. The planned duration&#xD;
      of participation for each patient may be up to 1 year. Patients must have demonstrated&#xD;
      benefit during the initial SMA-001 trial.&#xD;
