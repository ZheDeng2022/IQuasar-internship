  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mothers of adolescents with type 1 diabetes experience high levels of depressive symptoms,&#xD;
      which impair their ability to monitor and manage diabetes treatment effectively. Further,&#xD;
      maternal depressive symptoms are one of the strongest predictors of negative outcomes in&#xD;
      adolescents, including deteriorating glycemic control, problems with adherence, poorer&#xD;
      quality of life, and greater risk for depression. Given that adolescents are a high-risk&#xD;
      population for suboptimal glycemic control - with only 17% meeting treatment goals - there is&#xD;
      a critical need for novel interventions to improve outcomes in adolescents with T1D. Yet,&#xD;
      previous behavioral interventions for youth with diabetes have had only modest effects on&#xD;
      glycemic control, and none have directly targeted maternal depressive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Building on effective interventions to treat depression in adults, and our own pilot work in&#xD;
      this population, the proposed study will use a rigorous approach to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      a cognitive-behavioral intervention for mothers of adolescents with type 1 diabetes to&#xD;
      promote the use of adaptive coping strategies and positive parenting practices. The aims of&#xD;
      this study are to: 1) evaluate the effects of the Communication &amp; Coping intervention on&#xD;
      diabetes-related outcomes; 2) evaluate the effects of the Communication &amp; Coping intervention&#xD;
      on psychosocial outcomes; and 3) explore the differential impact of the intervention across&#xD;
      demographic factors. Mothers who are randomized to the Communication &amp; Coping Intervention&#xD;
      will receive individual cognitive-behavioral therapy sessions by phone, as well as access to&#xD;
      a Facebook group to augment the material covered in calls and provide social support. Mothers&#xD;
      randomized to the Attention Control condition will receive educational materials and phone&#xD;
      check-ins, as well as a Facebook group with educational posts. Adolescents and their mothers&#xD;
      will be assessed at baseline and again post-intervention, at 3 months, 6 months, and 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Mothers of adolescents with type 1 diabetes experience high levels of depressive symptoms,&#xD;
      which impair their ability to monitor and manage diabetes treatment effectively. The regimen&#xD;
      recommended for type 1 diabetes is complex and demanding, and caregivers - especially mothers&#xD;
      - experience stress related to the burden of treatment management. This stress is associated&#xD;
      with increased risk for psychosocial problems in caregivers, with rates of clinically&#xD;
      significant depressive symptoms evident in up to 61% of parents. Further, maternal depressive&#xD;
      symptoms are one of the strongest predictors of negative outcomes in adolescents, including&#xD;
      deteriorating glycemic control, problems with adherence, poorer quality of life, and greater&#xD;
      risk for depression. Given that adolescents are a high-risk population for suboptimal&#xD;
      glycemic control - with only 17% meeting treatment goals - there is a critical need for novel&#xD;
      interventions to improve outcomes in adolescents with T1D. Yet, previous behavioral&#xD;
      interventions for youth with diabetes have had only modest effects on glycemic control, and&#xD;
      none have directly targeted maternal depressive symptoms. Responding to the American Diabetes&#xD;
      Association's call to address the psychosocial needs of people with diabetes and their family&#xD;
      members, the proposed project has the potential to improve outcomes in both adolescents with&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes and their mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Building on effective interventions to treat depression in adults, and our own pilot work in&#xD;
      this population, the proposed study will use a rigorous approach to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      a cognitive-behavioral intervention for mothers of adolescents with type 1 diabetes to&#xD;
      promote the use of adaptive coping strategies and positive parenting practices. The aims of&#xD;
      this study are to: 1) evaluate the effects of the Communication &amp; Coping intervention on&#xD;
      diabetes-related outcomes; 2) evaluate the effects of the Communication &amp; Coping intervention&#xD;
      on psychosocial outcomes; and 3) explore the differential impact of the intervention across&#xD;
      demographic factors. Mothers who are randomized to the Communication &amp; Coping Intervention&#xD;
      will receive individual cognitive-behavioral therapy sessions by phone, as well as access to&#xD;
      a Facebook group to augment the material covered in calls and provide social support. Mothers&#xD;
      randomized to the Attention Control condition will receive educational materials and phone&#xD;
      check-ins, as well as a Facebook group with educational posts. Adolescents and their mothers&#xD;
      will be assessed at baseline and again post-intervention, at 3 months, 6 months, and 12&#xD;
      months. We hypothesize that the adolescents of mothers who receive the intervention will&#xD;
      demonstrate improvements in diabetes outcomes (i.e., glycemic control, adherence), as well as&#xD;
      psychosocial outcomes (i.e., improved quality of life, fewer depressive symptoms) compared to&#xD;
      those in the attention control condition. This approach is innovative by targeting maternal&#xD;
      depressive symptoms and the quality of parental involvement in mothers of adolescents with&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
