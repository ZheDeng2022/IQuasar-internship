  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Closed loop technology has been shown to reduce both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, as well&#xD;
      as reduce glycemic variability. Sensor augmented pump (SAP) therapy means the addition of&#xD;
      alerts according to high or low glucose values as well as trend arrows showing actual glucose&#xD;
      trends to pump therapy. This Hybrid closed loop (HCL) system provides several additional&#xD;
      effects compared to SAP therapy: according to actual and predicted sensor glucose values, the&#xD;
      insulin therapy can be adopted automatically by pump: in case of high values (or predicted)&#xD;
      more insulin will be administered, in case of low values (or predicted) the insulin infusion&#xD;
      will be decreased a suspended and resumed again. So the HCL provides a lot more automatic&#xD;
      functions to keep glucose in target compared to SAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current trial is to compare the SAP-therapy with the hybrid closed loop&#xD;
      glucose management in patients with type 1 diabetes at home.&#xD;

      Monocentric, randomized, controlled cross-over safety evaluation study. For the study, 20&#xD;
      subjects per age group (small children 2-&lt;9 years, children/adolescents ≥9-14 years) will be&#xD;
      enrolled (total n=40). The study is anticipated to last no longer than 6 months from&#xD;
      investigational center initiation to completion of all data entry and monitoring procedures.&#xD;
      It is estimated that all subjects will be enrolled into the study within approximately 3&#xD;
      months of study start.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1 - Day 0: (Subjects come to clinic): Consent, Screening (incl. blood sample) and&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Visit 2 - Week 1: Subjects come to clinic; start Run-in Period and start Sensor&#xD;
           Augmented Pump (SAP) therapy without any SmartGuard feature, assessment of AEs; pump&#xD;
           will be read out, data stored; subjects will be trained to use the Auto mode, Auto mode&#xD;
           will be activated. All subjects will participate in a 11-week study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 3 - Week 2: Subjects are randomized to start with SAP or Hybrid Closed Loop (HCL)&#xD;
           therapy and stay with an assigned therapy for next 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 4 - Week 6: End of Period 1 and start of washout period. Subjects stay in this&#xD;
           period with SAP therapy only. Evaluation of past 4 weeks, assessment of AEs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 5 - Week 7: Period 2 starts. Evaluation of past week, assessment of AEs. SAP group&#xD;
           will be using 670G with HCL and HCL group will be using SAP therapy for next 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 6 - Week 11: End of Study, Subjects come to clinic; evaluation of past 4 weeks,&#xD;
           assessment of AEs, HbA1c; pump will be read out, data stored. All study material will be&#xD;
           given back.&#xD;

    <description>The Intervention is the specific function of the Insulin Pump from Medtronic® with the name &quot;MiniMed® 670G (MMT-1780)&quot; to deliver Insulin as medication.&#xD;
This Medtronic MiniMed 670G Insulin Pump in Auto Mode is an Hybrid closed loop (HCL) system including an Auto Mode function. It provides as intervention several additional effects concerning automatically insulin delivery by pump: e.g. in case of high values (or predicted) - more insulin will be administered automatically, in case of low values (or predicted) - the insulin infusion will be decreased a suspended and resumed again. The patients will wear the pump continuously.</description>

This Medtronic MiniMed 670G Insulin Pump without Auto Mode' is a Sensor Augmented Pump (SAP) therapy and means the addition of alerts according to high or low glucose values as well as trend arrows showing actual glucose trends to pump therapy. The patients will wear the pump also continuously, but have to respond manually after the alarm. There are no automatically steps from the pump.</description>
