    <textblock>
      The TESTsmART Trial consists of two main aims. The overall goal of the two aims is to&#xD;
      investigate the impact of malaria rapid diagnostic test (mRDT) subsidies and conditional&#xD;
      artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) subsidies on the testing and treatment behavior of&#xD;
      participants seeking care for their febrile illness in the private retail sector. Conditional&#xD;
      ACT subsidies are discounts on quality-assured ACTs which are linked to the results of a&#xD;
      malaria rapid diagnostic test administered at the retail outlet; only participants with a&#xD;
      positive test will have access to an additional discount on a quality-assured ACT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of Aim 1 of this study is to identify a combination of conditional ACT and&#xD;
      RDT subsidies that maximizes the proportion of participants that choose to have a malaria&#xD;
      diagnostic test before taking a drug. The investigators will test two levels of conditional&#xD;
      ACT subsidy (100% subsidy versus ~67% subsidy) and two levels of RDT subsidy (0% subsidy and&#xD;
      50% subsidy) in a factorial designed experiment. Because dose size and therefore the price of&#xD;
      an ACT course are dependent upon patient age, the ACT subsidy amount will also be scaled with&#xD;
      patient age. These subsidy levels were chosen to keep the estimated program cost of the&#xD;
      combined subsidy within $0.30-0.60 USD per person (assuming 100% testing uptake and between&#xD;
      20-40% of participants having a positive RDT). These estimates represent an upper bound since&#xD;
      testing is unlikely to reach 100%. Current subsidy levels for ACT costs the program between&#xD;
      1.30-2.50 USD per treatment, with more than a third of that investment spent on individuals&#xD;
      without malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals presenting to a retail outlet for a treatment of a fever or suspected malaria&#xD;
      illness will be randomized to one of the four groups in equal proportions. A total of 840&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled (210 per arm). Their choices concerning uptake of testing and&#xD;
      drug purchase will be recorded. The main outcome will be the proportion of participants that&#xD;
      choose to take a test. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of participants who adhered&#xD;
      to the results of the RDT among those who were tested (used ACT when positive and did not use&#xD;
      an ACT when negative or without a test). The results of this study will be used to inform the&#xD;
      subsidy levels in the intervention for Aim 2 of this trial.&#xD;

      RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      From previous studies and implementation experiences, we know that consumption of ACTs&#xD;
      increases as the price declines. Declining prices of ACTs create a trade-off between access&#xD;
      and targeting; lower prices improve uptake of effective therapies by those with malaria but&#xD;
      also increase inappropriate use by those without malaria. Curbing inappropriate use and&#xD;
      targeting ACTs to malaria cases requires parasitological diagnosis which is virtually absent&#xD;
      in the retail sector. It has also been shown that RDTs can be safely deployed in the retail&#xD;
      sector. Most clients will agree to have an RDT if it is free. However, uptake of RDTs is&#xD;
      sensitive to the price of the RDT. Previous work has not specifically evaluated the&#xD;
      relationship between the price of the drug and the price of the test, but available evidence&#xD;
      suggests that uptake of the RDT is sensitive to the price of the ACT as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this work, we will link these two commodities through a diagnosis-dependent ACT subsidy.&#xD;
      Access to the additional ACT subsidy depends on having a positive RDT. What we need to&#xD;
      understand before scaling up a conditional subsidy is how the price of these two commodities&#xD;
      should be related. Should the conditionally-subsidized ACT be less expensive than the RDT?&#xD;
      Must the RDT be considerably less expensive than the retail price of ACT in order to motivate&#xD;
      people to purchase a test?&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study (Aim 1) we will use an individually-randomized experiment conducted among&#xD;
      customers at medicine retail outlets to identify the combination of RDT subsidy-level and&#xD;
      conditional ACT subsidy-level that maximizes uptake of diagnostic testing. We choose to focus&#xD;
      on diagnostic testing because this is the first step to achieving the downstream goals of ACT&#xD;
      targeting and rational use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use a factorial design to test two ACT subsidy levels and two RDT subsidy levels. The&#xD;
      unit of randomization will be the individual customer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be carried out in a sample of retail shops that carry quality-assured ACTs in&#xD;
      our study area in western Kenya. Ten shops will be randomly selected to participate in the&#xD;
      study. The study population will be any individual presenting to the shop with a malaria-like&#xD;
      illness. Children older than 1 year of age are eligible to be enrolled provided they are&#xD;
      physically present and accompanied by a parent or legal guardian. Customers with a&#xD;
      prescription from a health facility, who have already received a malaria diagnostic test or&#xD;
      who have already taken antimalarials prior to coming to the outlet will be excluded.&#xD;
      Individuals who have signs of severe disease will be excluded and referred immediately to a&#xD;
      health facility for care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research assistant (RA) will be stationed at participating outlets on random days in order&#xD;
      to avoid influencing treatment seeking behavior - in other words, to avoid attracting&#xD;
      customers because of the study team's presence. The RA will obtain consent and offer&#xD;
      participants a scratch card with a secret subsidy offer that will be revealed after the&#xD;
      participant is enrolled. Using the scratch card, the participants will be randomized, in a&#xD;
      1:1:1:1 ratio, to one of four study arms: 1) No subsidy for RDT (price to consumer=$0.40);&#xD;
      100% ACT subsidy (price to consumer=0) // 2) No subsidy for RDT (price to consumer=$0.40);&#xD;
      67% ACT subsidy (price to consumer=$0.40) // 3) 50% subsidy for RDT (price to&#xD;
      consumer=$0.20); 100% ACT subsidy (price to consumer=0) // 4) 50% subsidy for RDT (price to&#xD;
      consumer=$0.20); 67% ACT subsidy (price to consumer=$0.10-$0.40, dependent on patient age).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These four arms represent a 2x2 factorial experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant chooses to purchase a test at their assigned price (subsidy level), the&#xD;
      outlet will collect the money and the RA will perform the test. (RAs have been trained in&#xD;
      RDTs and blood safety and have conducted thousands of RDTs. If the test is positive, the&#xD;
      participant is entitled to an additional discount on their ACT purchase according to their&#xD;
      group identified on the scratch card. If the test is negative, the participant may purchase&#xD;
      any medicine they choose, including a regularly-priced ACT. Those who opt not to purchase an&#xD;
      RDT may continue with their transaction as they choose, including purchasing a&#xD;
      regularly-priced ACT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outlet attendant will sell the medicines to the customer, including a discounted ACT, if&#xD;
      eligible. The study team will reimburse the outlet the difference between the retail price&#xD;
      and the discounted price.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RDTs selected for the study will be a World Health Organization (WHO) approved product&#xD;
      that exceed 95% sensitivity and 95% specificity for Plasmodium falciparum [Malaria Rapid&#xD;
      Diagnostic Test Performance, Round 1-5, WHO 2014].&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome for Aim 1 is the customer's decision to purchase an RDT (yes/no). Using&#xD;
      the 2x2 factorial design we will separately evaluate the effect of RDT price (2 levels) and&#xD;
      of conditional ACT subsidies (2 levels) on the primary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main secondary outcome is the proportion of tested participants who are adherent to the&#xD;
      test result among those tested. Adherence is defined as taking a quality-assured ACT if the&#xD;
      RDT is positive or taking another drug (or no drug) if the test is negative. We will also&#xD;
      measure the proportion of people who purchase a full-price ACT among those who do not use an&#xD;
      RDT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We estimated the sample size required in each of the four study arms for a design with equal&#xD;
      numbers of individuals allocated to each arm and where we wish to detect a 15-percentage&#xD;
      point increase in RDT testing between an unsubsidized RDT compared to a subsidized RDT and to&#xD;
      detect a 10 percentage-point difference in testing uptake between a partially and a fully&#xD;
      subsidized ACT (conditional on a positive RDT) with at least 90% power and 5% chance of a&#xD;
      two-tailed Type I error for each of the two comparisons. To do so, we estimate that we will&#xD;
      need 210 subjects per arm (total=840).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENROLLMENT AND FOLLOW UP:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be screened and enrolled on the day they visit the outlet. Data&#xD;
      collection will be brief and will be completed on the same day. Participants will be screened&#xD;
      as they arrive, enrolled if eligible and willing, tested if they choose and then allowed to&#xD;
      proceed with their transaction at the outlet. Upon completion, they will be briefly&#xD;
      interviewed again before leaving. Because the interaction with the participant is short and&#xD;
      completed in one encounter, we expect minimal loss to follow-up (for example, participants&#xD;
      leaving before the final questions).&#xD;

      <recruitment_details>The study was carried out in a random sample of twelve retail outlets in two sub-counties of rural western Kenya. Potential participants were approached by the research assistants as they sought services at the outlets. Participants were then offered a scratch card with masked arm assignment, which randomized them to one of four study arms in a 1:1:1:1 ratio, each arm with a different combination of two different RDT prices and two different conditional ACT prices using a 2x2 factorial design.</recruitment_details>
