    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, open-label, 2-period cross-over study (16&#xD;
      weeks per treatment period) to evaluate flexible dosing and daily push dosing of IGSC 20% in&#xD;
      treatment-experienced subjects with PI. An additional, separate cohort of treatment-naïve,&#xD;
      non-randomized subjects who will not be part of the crossover are included and will receive a&#xD;
      loading dose of 5 consecutive daily doses of IGSC 20% followed by weekly infusions of IGSC&#xD;
      20% starting Week 1 (Day 8) through Week 32 (end of Treatment Phase).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For treatment-experienced subjects, the study consists of a Screening Visit, Baseline Visit,&#xD;
      16-week Treatment Period 1, 16-week Treatment Period 2, and Final Visit/Early Termination&#xD;
      Visit. For treatment-naïve subjects, the study consists of a Screening Visit, a Baseline&#xD;
      Visit, a 32-week Treatment Phase, and Final Visit/Early Termination Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 54 treatment-experienced subjects and approximately 6 treatment-naïve subjects&#xD;
      will be enrolled at study centers in the United States (US) and European Union (EU).&#xD;

      This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, open-label, 2-period cross-over study (16&#xD;
      weeks per treatment period) to evaluate flexible dosing and daily push dosing of IGSC 20% in&#xD;
      treatment-experienced subjects with PI. There is an additional, separate cohort of&#xD;
      treatment-naïve, non-randomized subjects with PI who will not be part of the crossover.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment-experienced subjects entering the study will maintain the same IgG dose (mg/kg)&#xD;
      received prestudy that will be normalized to the study-assigned dose-time interval (ie, there&#xD;
      will be 1:1 correspondence regardless of prestudy route of administration [intravenous [IV]&#xD;
      or SC]). Treatment-experienced subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio into 1 of 3&#xD;
      parallel cohorts consisting of 18 subjects each as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1 (daily push compared with every 2 weeks [biweekly] pump) will evaluate syringe daily&#xD;
      push dosing versus every 2 weeks [biweekly] ambulatory pump administration. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 sequences, either beginning with syringe daily push&#xD;
      dosing for 16 weeks and then crossing over to ambulatory pump administration every 2 weeks&#xD;
      for 16 weeks or the reverse sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2 (daily push compared with once weekly pump) will evaluate syringe daily push dosing&#xD;
      versus once weekly ambulatory pump administration. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio&#xD;
      to 1 of 2 sequences, either beginning with syringe daily push dosing for 16 weeks and then&#xD;
      crossing over to ambulatory pump administration once every week for 16 weeks or the reverse&#xD;
      sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 3 (daily push compared with 2 times/week pump) will evaluate syringe daily push dosing&#xD;
      versus 2 times/week ambulatory pump administration. Ambulatory pump dosing will take place on&#xD;
      preselected days (eg, Monday and Thursday) not less than 3 days apart. The dosing days should&#xD;
      remain constant for the duration of the study. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to&#xD;
      1 of 2 sequences, either beginning with syringe daily push dosing for 16 weeks and then&#xD;
      crossing over to ambulatory pump administration 2 times/week for 16 weeks or the reverse&#xD;
      sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment-naïve cohort will receive a loading dose of 5 consecutive daily doses of IGSC&#xD;
      20% 150 mg/kg/day (Week 0, Days 1-5) followed by weekly infusions of 150 mg/kg starting Week&#xD;
      1 (Day 8) through Week 32 (end of Treatment Phase).&#xD;

             a Child Assent form approved by the IRB/EC per the institution's requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        For all subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has clinical evidence of any significant acute or chronic disease that, in the opinion&#xD;
             of the investigator, may interfere with successful completion of the trial or place&#xD;
             the subject at undue medical risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has had a known serious adverse reaction to immunoglobulin or any anaphylactic&#xD;
             reaction to blood or any blood-derived product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history of blistering skin disease, clinically significant thrombocytopenia,&#xD;
             bleeding disorder, diffuse rash, recurrent skin infections, or other disorders where&#xD;

             actual quantitative deficit in total IgG. For example, SAD is defined as an impaired&#xD;
             specific IgG response to pneumococcal vaccine with normal serum concentrations of IgG,&#xD;
             IgM, and IgA. Isolated IgG subclass deficiency is defined as an abnormally low level&#xD;
             of 1 or more IgG subclass in subjects with normal levels of total IgG and IgM.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known selective IgA deficiency (with or without antibodies to IgA) (Note:&#xD;
             exclusion is for the specific diagnostic entity. It does not exclude other forms of&#xD;
             humoral primary immunodeficiency which have decreased IgA in addition to decreased IgG&#xD;
             requiring IgG replacement).&#xD;
&#xD;

             intrauterine device or intrauterine system, condom or occlusive cap with spermicidal&#xD;
             foam/gel/film/cream/suppository, male sterilization, or true abstinence) throughout&#xD;
             the study. Note: True abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual&#xD;
             lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
             symptothermal, post-ovulation methods], declaration of abstinence for the duration of&#xD;
             a trial, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.)&#xD;
