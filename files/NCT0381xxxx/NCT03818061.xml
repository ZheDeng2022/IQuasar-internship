      This proof-of-concept study aims to assess the clinical and biological effects of&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients will receive the combination of Atezolizumab 1200 mg and Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg by IV&#xD;
      infusion every 3 weeks. Treatment will be continued until disease progression, unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity or voluntary withdrawal. In the absence of unacceptable toxicity, patients who meet&#xD;
      criteria for disease progression per RECIST v1.1 while receiving study treatment will be&#xD;
      permitted to continue the study treatment if they meet all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evidence of clinical benefit, as determined by the investigator following a review of&#xD;
           all available data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absence of symptoms and signs (including laboratory values, such as new or worsening&#xD;
           hypercalcemia) indicating unequivocal progression of disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absence of decline in ECOG Performance Status that can be attributed to disease&#xD;
           progression&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absence of tumor progression at critical anatomical sites (e.g., leptomeningeal disease)&#xD;
           that cannot be managed by protocol-allowed medical interventions.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The sample size calculation will use an adaptive Simon 2-stage design based on the strategy developed by Lin and Shih (Biometrics 2004). This method allows checking the result at the first stage, adjusting the power and success rate if necessary, and adapting the decision rule accordingly. A minimum of 69 patients (up to 110) will be enrolled in 2 parallel independent cohorts depending on the HPV status of their tumors: cohort A (HPV+, N = 42 to 59) and cohort B (HPV-, N = 27 to 51).</intervention_model_description>
