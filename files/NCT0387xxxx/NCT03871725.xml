  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is a new treatment for carotid atherosclerotic plaque. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to evaluate the safety and initial effectiveness of this technique.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Carotid atherosclerotic plaque is an important cause of ischemic stroke. Treatments for&#xD;
      patients with carotid plaque include lifestyle changes, medical management(such as control of&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes) and carotid revascularization(carotid&#xD;
      endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting). Studies have suggested that plaque morphology and&#xD;
      composition are important determinants of plaque stability, using serial MR imaging of the&#xD;
      carotid artery allowed observation of changes in plaque composition. Contrast enhanced&#xD;
      ultrasound (CEUS) is a well accepted technique for detection of intraplaque&#xD;
      neovascularization(IPN) in carotid atherosclerotic disease. The purpose of this trial is to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and initial effectiveness of SDT. The SDT can induce macrophage&#xD;
      elimination and inhibit matrix degradation, which will promote plaque lipid depletion,&#xD;
      inflammation level decrease and changes in other plaque tissue components, leading to plaque&#xD;
      stabilization and reduction.&#xD;

    <description>Sinoporphyrin sodium (DVDMS) as sonosensitizer, is dissolved in 0.9% sodium solution for following skin test and intravenous injection. 0.01mg/ml DVDMS solution (0.1ml) is prepared for skin test followed by 0.04 mg/ml DVDMS solution intravenous injection (0.2mg/kg).The target atherosclerotic lesions are marked on the corresponding skin with ultrasound guidance and underwent ultrasound exposure after 4 hours incubation. The therapeutic ultrasonic transducer is fixed to the marked skin site for 15min of each lesion. Ultrasound parameters included intensity of 1.6W/cm2 for carotid lesions, resonance frequency: 1.0 MHz and duty factor: 30%.</description>
