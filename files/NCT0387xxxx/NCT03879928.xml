    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in healthy volunteers designed&#xD;
      to assess the safety, tolerability and PK of FM101. This study will consist of 3 parts: a SAD&#xD;
      part, a single dose FE part and a MAD part. Each subject is to participate in only 1 part of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
