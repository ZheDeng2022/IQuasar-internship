  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Nesfatin-1 is an 82-amino acid polypeptide derived from the nucleobindin 2 (NUCB2)&#xD;
           precursor proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is a newly identified peptide. It is released from several tissues including&#xD;
           forebrain, hindbrain, brainstem, spinal cord and adipose tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It plays an important role in hypothalamic pathways such as feeding inhibition,&#xD;
           locomotion, stress modulation, thermogenesis, and reproduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Several studies had demonstrated that nesfatin-1 associated with body mass index (BMI),&#xD;
           insulin resistance and inflammatory response disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common causes of infertility in&#xD;
           women. It is characterized by hyperandrogenism, multiple ovarian cysts,&#xD;
           oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea. Many mechanisms had been reported to be responsible for the&#xD;
           pathophysiology of PCOS. The condition is thought to be interactions between&#xD;
           hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and metabolic&#xD;
           disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The circulating level of nesfatin-1 in PCOS patients is controversial. Some studies&#xD;
           reveal lower nesfatin-1 serum levels while others reveal higher level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women with PCOS may have reduced dopamine production from the hypothalamus and elevated&#xD;
           prolactin concentrations and this mechanism may be responsible for reproductive&#xD;
           disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In PCOS, stimulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation from mononuclear cells&#xD;
           (MNCs) by hyperglycemia . The superoxide radical in particular is a ROS that is&#xD;
           generated by the activity of membrane-bound nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate&#xD;
           (NADPH) oxidase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dopaminergic (DA) neurons are highly susceptible to ROS. DA is relatively unstable&#xD;
           molecule and undergoes auto-oxidative metabolism in nigro striatal tract system, leading&#xD;
           to ROS production. Nicotinamide can reduce hypothalamic dopamine in postnatal brains&#xD;
           results in dopamine-deficient phenotypes. Nicotinamide prevents DA release induced by&#xD;
           long-term perinatal asphyxia.&#xD;

        The PCOS patients included in this study will be selected from out patient's clinic of the&#xD;
        department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at Assiut university hospital, Assiut, Egypt,&#xD;
        during one year after the study begins. Informed consent will be obtained from each patient&#xD;
        before the examination after explaining the aim of the study to each participant, and the&#xD;
        study will be approved by the ethical committee of our institution. The gathered&#xD;
        demographic information and complete data will be collected.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PCOS patients in the age range 18 - 40 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of PCOS is based on the 2003 ESHRE/ASRM diagnostic criteria, according to&#xD;
             which patients who had at least two of the following conditions are accepted as having&#xD;
             PCOS:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Oligo or anovulation, defined by the presence of oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea,&#xD;
                  confirmed by luteal progesterone and normal serum follicle stimulating hormone&#xD;
                  (FSH) levels (1.0-10.0 IU/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Clinical hyperandrogenism signs which was defined as the presence of at least one&#xD;
                  of the following three features: hirsutism, acne, and androgenic alopecia.&#xD;
                  Biochemical hyperandrogenism was defined as a serum testosterone (T) level &gt;60&#xD;
                  ng/dL (&gt;2.08 nmol/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. PCOS manifestation was defined as the presence of &gt;12 unilateral follicles 2-9 mm&#xD;
                  in size on the ovary or having the least unilateral ovary volume of 10 cm3 by&#xD;
                  ultrasonography (the measurement was performed when there was no follicle &gt;10&#xD;
                  mm). Ovarian volume was calculated by the formula [0.5× ovarian length ×&#xD;
                  thickness × width]. In the case of transabdominal ultrasonography, the presence&#xD;
                  of at least 10 unilateral antral follicles was required.&#xD;
