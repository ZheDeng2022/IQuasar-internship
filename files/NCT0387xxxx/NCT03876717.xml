    <textblock>
      Bile acid diarrhoea is a chronic disease that impairs quality of life. One in 100 has the&#xD;
      condition and many suffer from the disease without knowing. The current test is called SeHCAT&#xD;
      and is expensive and time-consuming and is unavailable in many places, including the US. The&#xD;
      disease is often misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome and estimated one third of patients&#xD;
      with irritable bowel syndrome of the mixed type and the diarrhoea predominant type suffer&#xD;
      from bile acid diarrhoea without knowing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blood test called 7α-hydroxy-4-cholestene-3-one (C4) could make it much easier to diagnose&#xD;
      bile acid diarrhoea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To establish the new test, the results of both C4 and SeHCAT are compared with the treatment&#xD;
      effect of the drug called colesevelam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We invite patients who are referred for the SeHCAT test to participate in the trial. The&#xD;
      SeHCAT test takes two days that are one week apart. The study patients register stool habits&#xD;
      with a diary in the week between the SeHCAT visits. Based on the diary results, we screen for&#xD;
      eligibility; e.g. a certain degree/severity of diarrhoea is required for participation. We&#xD;
      treat eligible study patients (i.e those with diarrhoea) with either colesevelam or placebo&#xD;
      (medicine without effect) that is randomly assigned. 170 study patients need to complete the&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to validate (ie. compare) both the C4-test and the SeHCAT test with the colesevelam&#xD;
      treatment response as the reference.&#xD;

      ISSUE Bile Acid Diarrhoea (BAD) affects 1% of the general population and many people live&#xD;
      with the disease and the impaired quality of life it causes without knowing it. The current&#xD;
      scintigraphic seleno-homo-taurocholic acid retention test (SeHCAT) is time-consuming,&#xD;
      expensive and causes a diagnostic bottleneck. the SeHCAT test is unavailable in many&#xD;
      countries including the US. The biomarker 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4) could provide a&#xD;
      cheap and available diagnostic option to surmount the issue of the many undiagnosed patients.&#xD;
      The pivotal step for this is validation of the C4-test with the placebo-controlled treatment&#xD;
      effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the efficacy and safety of colesevelam for treating Bile Acid Diarrhoea&#xD;
&#xD;
           and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 2. To correlate both the current scintigraphic 75-Selenium conjugated Tauro-homocholic&#xD;
           acid retention test (SeHCAT) and the biochemical marker of BAD&#xD;
           7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4) with colesevelam treatment response, and to&#xD;
           validate the cut-off values determined in the 'VABAD' trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND Chronic diarrhoea affects 4-5% of the Western adult population and often results&#xD;
      in specialist referral and endoscopies. Availability of the diagnostic SeHCAT test for BAD is&#xD;
      limited, and BAD is often mistaken for the Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). 32% of patients&#xD;
      with two of the three IBS subtypes have BAD and the prevalence of BAD in the general&#xD;
      population is thus approximately 1%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DIAGNOSIS of Bile Acid Diarrhoea The current diagnostic test for BAD is the SeHCAT&#xD;
      scintigraphic retention test using 75Selenium labelled Homo-tauro-cholic acid. The γ-emission&#xD;
      is measured on day 1 and again on day 8. Seven-day SeHCAT retention rates of &lt;5% represent&#xD;
      severe BAD, &lt;10% moderate BAD, and &lt;15% mild BAD. Although not properly validated, in&#xD;
      observational studies 70-80% of patients with SeHCAT &lt;10% report a good response to&#xD;
      cholestyramine. SeHCAT is unavailable in many countries including the the US, and clinicians&#xD;
      instead rely on the patient's response to a therapeutic trial. However, the non-specific&#xD;
      action and multiple side effects of the first line treatment with cholestyramine gives rise&#xD;
      to multiple diagnostic pitfalls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIOMARKERS of Bile Acid Diarrhoea The recent increased insight into bile acid homeostasis and&#xD;
      regulation has identified two biomarkers of BAD that may replace SeHCAT.&#xD;
      7α-hydroxy-4-cholestene-3-one (C4) is a bile acid precursor that correlates with bile acids&#xD;
      synthesis rate. C4 is increased in BAD and has a sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 86%&#xD;
      for diagnosing BAD defined by SeHCAT &lt;10%. However, analysis of C4 is technically difficult&#xD;
      and is thus primarily used at centres with special interest and no access to SeHCAT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another biomarker Fibroblast Growth Factor 19 (FGF19) is released to the portal circulation&#xD;
      from the terminal ileum in response to bile acid absorption. In the liver, FGF19 inhibits&#xD;
      bile acid synthesis enticing a negative feedback loop. Fasting values of FGF19 correlate&#xD;
      inversely with C4 and with SeHCAT, but the sensitivity of 67% and specificity of 77% for&#xD;
      detecting even severe BAD is clinically insufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performance of the biomarkers in a modern Danish population The investigators studied C4 and&#xD;
      FGF19 in two pilot studies in selected populations and further established a Danish national&#xD;
      collaboration with four university hospitals and prospectively recruited 71 subjects. The&#xD;
      positive test cut-off C4 ≥ 30 ng/mL had 52% sensitivity and 91% specificity for detecting BAD&#xD;
      defined by SeHCAT ≤ 10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of these results and the literature suggest that taking account of liver&#xD;
      cirrhosis, hyperbilirubinemia, and use of alcohol and statins may increase the diagnostic&#xD;
      yield of C4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT OF BILE ACID DIARRHOEA Sequestrants bind bile acids in the intestinal lumen and&#xD;
      thus alleviate the diarrhoea symptoms. The first line therapy is cholestyramine, but this&#xD;
      powder-formulation is distasteful with a low patient acceptability. Colesevelam tablets are&#xD;
      much better tolerated, and therefore placebo-controlled studies of colesevelam for BAD are&#xD;
      warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A systematic review found cholestyramine to be effective in 70% of BAD patients. A&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial of colesevelam in patients with suspected type 1 BAD. Diarrhoea&#xD;
      intention-to-treat remission rates were 67% for colesevelam and 27% for placebo (p=0.057),&#xD;
      but extreme selection criteria slowed recruitment and the study ended prematurely. Of note,&#xD;
      only one of 19 dropped out due to side effects to colesevelam. In summary, colesevelam and&#xD;
      cholestyramine have similar response rates of 70%. For a clinical trial, colesevelam is&#xD;
      superior due to effective blinding and a much lower dropout rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Effect parameters in chronic diarrhoea Symptoms reported by diary The Bristol stool&#xD;
      form scale (BSFS) classifies stool from 1 (hard lumps) to 7 (completely watery). Clinical&#xD;
      trials often use a seven-day diary. Patients with an organic cause of diarrhoea more often&#xD;
      have ≥3 stools per day or a consistently watery stool consistency (BSF≥6) than those who have&#xD;
      a functional cause of the diarrhoea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for activity and remission of diarrhoea (Hjortswang's criteria) Hjortswang&#xD;
      correlated chronic diarrhoea symptoms with impact on quality of life for patients with&#xD;
      microscopic colitis, and validated the definition of clinical activity as ≥ 3 stools per day&#xD;
      or ≥ 1 watery stool (BSF 6-7) and remission as &lt;3 stools per day and &lt; 1 watery stool as a&#xD;
      mean of the seven-day diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEDICINE Colesevelam The hospital pharmacy of the Capital Region over-encapsulates&#xD;
      colesevelam tablets with Capsugel® DBcaps®&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo Matrix placebo tablets, over-encapsulated as the colesevelam tablets. No side effects&#xD;
      are expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose: One, two or three capsules of 625mg twice daily. The dose is titrated by a central&#xD;
      blinded study nurse without contact to the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POWER CALCULATION Assumed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  remission rate of 67% for colesevelam and 27% for placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  two-sided α = 0.05 and β = 0.20 (ie. 80% power).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1:1 allocation. This gives 23 subjects with BAD in each arm (G.Power 3.1: z-test of two&#xD;
           independent proportions). 27% of subjects in our prospective pilot study that would be&#xD;
           eligible for the SINBAD study had SeHCAT &lt;10%. Thus, (2 x 23 / 27%) = 170 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIOCHEMISTRY C4 and bile acid species are analysed with liquid chromatography - tandem mass&#xD;
      spectrometry. FGF19 is analysed with ELISA (R&amp;D Systems, MN, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hospital laboratories of the participating centres perform the routine biochemical&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PLAN Pre-screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. We send a written invitation to eligible patients who already are referred for SeHCAT&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. At the first SeHCAT visit, further information is provided and voluntary informed&#xD;
           consent is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visit 1 - Day 1: start of baseline registration The investigator creates an electronic&#xD;
      Case Record Form (EasyTrial) including medical and surgical history, medication, and physical&#xD;
      status. Baseline blood analyses include ALT, ALP, bilirubin, amylase; and on indication HCG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator notifies the referring doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants start Study Diary 1 (screening+baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visit 2 - Day 8: Screening results - randomisation This is concurrent with the second&#xD;
      SeHCAT visit. All subjects meet in the fasting for blood sampling. All subjects answer the&#xD;
      baseline questionnaires (SHS, GSRS, SF36v2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening diary is assessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects without diarrhoea: cannot continue to randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. SeHCAT results are registered once available&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Result of the diagnostic work-up is registered at a six-month telephone follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with diarrhoea: continue to randomisation. The subject&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  is given a uniquely numbered treatment package&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  starts Study Diary 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  is telephoned by the central study nurse for the planning of dose titration&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone consultation - Day 9 (treatment day 2):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study nurse takes a history of adverse events and titres the dose&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone consultation - day 13 (± 1 day): End of Run-in-period As on day 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ad hoc telephone consultations Any change in dose mandates a follow-up telephone consult&#xD;
      after 2-3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visit 3 - Day 21 (+ 1-3 days) Intervention-End The intervention has ended on day 20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collects Study Diary 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Takes a history of AEs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collects surplus medication to assess compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Distributes questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Orders follow-up blood analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Schedules study-end telephone consultation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone consultation - Study day 26 (± 2 day): Clinical Study end AE registration continues&#xD;
      three days after the end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess biochemical AEs&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Informs of results&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Takes a history of AEs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Takes action if needed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six-month follow-up The questionnaires are redistributed. The patient's Medical file is&#xD;
      checked and a telephone interview is done to note any conclusive diagnosis on the patients&#xD;
      diarrhoea and (if any) anti-diarrhoea medication&#xD;
