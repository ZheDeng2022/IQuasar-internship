    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ruxolitinib when given together&#xD;
      with venetoclax in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia that has come back&#xD;
      (relapsed) or has not responded to treatment (refractory). Ruxolitinib may stop the growth of&#xD;
      cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Venetoclax may stop the&#xD;
      growth of cancer cells by blocking Bcl-2, a protein needed for cancer cell survival. This&#xD;
      study is being done to see if the combination of ruxolitinib and venetoclax works better in&#xD;
      treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia compared to standard of care chemotherapy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and assess the safety of ruxolitinib in&#xD;
      combination with venetoclax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the preliminary efficacy of the ruxolitinib and venetoclax combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate overall and event-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess in vitro kinase inhibitor sensitivity using patient bone marrow (or peripheral&#xD;
      blood) before and after treatment with the ruxolitinib and venetoclax combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To use molecular techniques (potentially including next-generation sequencing and/or BH3&#xD;
      profiling) to examine the mechanisms of response versus (vs.) no response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To correlate molecular features with the patient response and resistance to venetoclax&#xD;
      combination therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) concentrations in vivo of the&#xD;
      dual drug combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ruxolitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ruxolitinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and venetoclax PO once daily (QD)&#xD;
      on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may receive additional cycles of ruxolitinib&#xD;
      and venetoclax at the discretion of the sponsor-investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months.&#xD;

    <measure>Dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of ruxolitinib and venetoclax in combination</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to day 56</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of ruxolitinib and venetoclax combination will be determined according to the &quot;keyboard&quot; Bayesian toxicity probability interval design. The MTD of the ruxolitinib and venetoclax combination will correspond to the dose level closest to the target DLT probability of 30% and will be estimated from observed dose level-specific DLT rates using isotonic regression. The study will start at dose level 0 with a potential escalation/de-escalation decision occurring for each subsequent cohort of 3 enrolled participants according to the predefined keyboard rules until a dose level has been assigned to all 30 subjects.</description>

    <measure>Clinical benefit rate (CBR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose to end of cycle 2 (up to 36 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The clinical benefit rate (CBR) is defined as the proportion of evaluable subjects obtaining stable disease (SD), partial remission (PR), or composite complete remission (CCR) during the first 2 cycles of therapy. Will be estimated, along with 95% confidence intervals.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall incidence of treatment-related and non-treatment related toxicity</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose to 30 days after last dose of study agent</time_frame>
    <description>The overall incidence of treatment- related and non-treatment- related toxicity will be determined using the safety-evaluable population. The point estimate and 95% confidence interval for the proportion of patients with each of these toxicity types will be reported. Each toxicity event (there can be &gt; 1 event per participant) will be tabulated by dose level and summarized by severity and major organ site according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0.</description>

    <measure>Duration of response</measure>
    <time_frame>From first PR or better to loss of best response, or date of last assessment (up to 24 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Cumulative incidence functions will be applied to the &quot;competing risks&quot; of the duration of response endpoint, namely, loss of best response and non-relapse death.</description>
