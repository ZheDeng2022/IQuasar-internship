    <textblock>
      A significant opportunity exists to involve patients and their caregivers in more effective&#xD;
      perioperative care and transition to home for transplant patients. Stakeholders were engaged&#xD;
      through the University of Cincinnati Liver Transplant Program to prioritize changes in&#xD;
      improving post transplant care. The initial findings indicated that increasing &quot;care between&#xD;
      visits&quot; is the top priority for patients for improving function, quality of life and&#xD;
      independence. Building on existing telehealth research, an enhanced home management program&#xD;
      (HMP) to leverage and improve patient self-care following liver transplantation was&#xD;
      developed, specifically by improving adherence, reducing readmissions and improving the&#xD;
      transition from hospital to home. The improvement of care may have profound effect in the&#xD;
      first 90 days after transplant on important long-term health parameters that affect clinical&#xD;
      outcomes such as depression, weight gain, blood pressure control and diabetes management.&#xD;
      With patient engagement, a randomized controlled trial is proposed comparing traditional&#xD;
      provider-based care vs. traditional care with HMP. These two arms will need 50 patients in&#xD;
      each arm with a 0.5 year follow up. Patients have said that the primary outcomes are quality&#xD;
      of life, function and independence. To that end, the primary study outcomes are assessment of&#xD;
      adherence, readmissions (90-day), patient satisfaction. The HMP model will advise providers,&#xD;
      health care systems, and transplant centers how to improve patient care, especially among&#xD;
      those at greatest risk of poor outcomes specifically minorities and those of low&#xD;
      socioeconomic status.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The successful care of patients undergoing liver transplantation and support of their&#xD;
      caregivers consumes significant personal, institutional and community resources before and&#xD;
      after surgery. Depression and anxiety are common after transplant, leading to apprehension&#xD;
      about the ability to care successfully for oneself and poor adherence with complex medication&#xD;
      and health behavior regimens.1,2 Although a patient's quality of life improves immediately&#xD;
      following transplantation, when compared with the general population the vast majority of&#xD;
      liver transplant recipients have significant deficiencies in most quality of life domains.3,4&#xD;
      This is most evident in minorities and patients of low socioeconomic status who have&#xD;
      difficulty adjusting to the demands of complex medical and surgical care and are challenged&#xD;
      by lack of literacy and cultural bias.5-7 Indeed, the reoperation and readmission rate in the&#xD;
      first 90 days are the highest of any surgery performed in the United States.8 Effective&#xD;
      perioperative care is critical following surgery in this high acuity patient population.&#xD;
      Optimizing care in the perioperative period should improve recovery and outcomes, including&#xD;
      depression, general health maintenance and long-term adherence.9,10 While practice guidelines&#xD;
      for care after liver transplant exist, they lack specifics and are based on outdated models&#xD;
      that do not reflect patient preferences, needs or expectations. Improving current processes&#xD;
      in health care delivery before and after liver transplantation is critical to optimize&#xD;
      outcomes that matter: survival, function, and independence. The improvement of care may have&#xD;
      profound effect in the first 90 days after transplant on important long-term health&#xD;
      parameters that affect clinical outcomes such as depression, weight gain, blood pressure&#xD;
      control and diabetes management.11 Through a stakeholder engagement process with the&#xD;
      University of Cincinnati Liver Transplant Program designed to find ways to improve post&#xD;
      transplant care, increasing &quot;care between visits&quot; is the top priority for patients to improve&#xD;
      function, quality of life and independence. Patients said that medication adherence and&#xD;
      hospital readmissions are their largest barrier to success, and that they believe care&#xD;
      immediately post-transplant in the first 90 days is the most important determinant of&#xD;
      long-term outcomes. A twenty-patient pilot program assessed the feasibility of a&#xD;
      patient-designed telehealth monitoring program after liver transplant, and it met with an&#xD;
      extraordinary level of enthusiasm by our patients. In this proposal, the ability of this home&#xD;
      management program (HMP) will be tested, developed by patients for patients, to improve&#xD;
      transition care from hospital to home and patient adherence with a self-care regimen&#xD;
      following liver transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medical community must develop innovative health delivery systems following complex&#xD;
      surgeries like transplantation in order to maximize post-operative care, adherence to a new&#xD;
      and complex self-care regimen, independence, and ultimately survival. Our proposed telehealth&#xD;
      delivery model will optimize the quality, efficiency and outcomes of post-discharge care&#xD;
      following liver transplantation. The HMP model will advise providers, health care systems,&#xD;
      and transplant centers how to improve patient care, especially among those at greatest risk&#xD;
      of poor outcomes, specifically minorities and those of low socioeconomic status. The&#xD;
      objective of this proposal with the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Perform a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the impact of an enhanced,&#xD;
      telehealth-based home management program (HMP) on medication and behavioral self-care&#xD;
      adherence rates, and on 90-day and 1-year readmission rates following discharge for liver&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Through enhanced patient engagement, HMP will increase medication and self-care&#xD;
      adherence rates and reduce 90-day and 1-year readmission rates when compared to a traditional&#xD;
      care model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SubAim 1A: To determine whether underserved and minority patients achieve greater benefit&#xD;
      from the HMP compared with more advantaged patient populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Evaluate the impact of the HMP on more distal clinical outcomes post liver&#xD;
      transplantation including weight control, diabetes management, blood pressure regulation and&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Enhanced home monitoring will have persisting health benefits beyond the 90-day&#xD;
      time frame of the HMP intervention on a variety of chronic disease measures important in this&#xD;
      population, including weight loss, diabetes management, blood pressure control, and&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;
