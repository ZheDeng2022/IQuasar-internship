    <textblock>
      Observational study looking at the burden of illness in achondroplasia subjects aged 3 and&#xD;
      above. The study will include a 3 year review of historical clinical data as well as a single&#xD;
      point collection of questionnaire data to look at the impact on the following in individuals&#xD;
      with achondroplasia versus a normative population:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical burden&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthcare resource use&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Socio-economic burden&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychosocial burden&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 175 subjects will be enrolled in sites in Argentina, Colombia and Brazil.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multinational, epidemiological, observational, retrospective, cross-sectional study&#xD;
      of individuals with achondroplasia (subjects). This study will be conducted at up to&#xD;
      approximately 4 sites in Latin American Countries - Brazil, Argentina and Colombia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be identified for participation in the study via three routes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. During routine hospital visits&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. From clinic lists of those previously treated but no longer followed at the study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Through collaboration of the Investigator with Achondroplasia patient organizations,&#xD;
           other Achondroplasia-related organizations, other healthcare professionals in their&#xD;
           country and Achondroplasia-related social media sites. A recruitment flyer will be&#xD;
           provided to these organizations, healthcare professionals and distributed to potential&#xD;
           subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected over a minimum of the three years prior to the date of enrolment.&#xD;
      Clinical and healthcare resource use data will be collected from medical records. For each&#xD;
      subject enrolled, data from medical records will be collected and entered onto an electronic&#xD;
      case report form (eCRF) at each site. Data collection from medical records will be&#xD;
      supplemented by records provided by the subject and, if necessary, confirmed by the family&#xD;
      Doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data about QoL, mobility, psychosocial burden, socio-economic burden and healthcare resource&#xD;
      use will be collected via a booklet of validated and structured questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characteristics of subjects with achondroplasia (QoL scores, healthcare resource use,&#xD;
      educational level, family status, employment status) will be compared with those of the&#xD;
      general population, where available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this is an observational study, participation will not affect the subject/Investigator&#xD;
      relationship, nor influence Investigator's treatment, therapeutic or other management of the&#xD;
      subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject participation onto the study will be voluntary, without financial support to the&#xD;
      subject.&#xD;
