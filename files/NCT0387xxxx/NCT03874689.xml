  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the prevalence of taeniosis and (neuro)cysticercosis in two&#xD;
      districts in the southern (Gwembe) and eastern province (Chipata) of Zambia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The true prevalence of Neurocyticercosis in Zambia is not well known. Only one study which&#xD;
      was a pilot study done in Katete district of eastern province demonstrated the prevalence of&#xD;
      NCC among people with epilepsy. There is need to provide an accurate estimate of the&#xD;
      prevalence of NCC among people with cysticercosis in Zambia as well as understand the&#xD;
      clinical manifestations of the disease in humans. Data on the full range of clinical&#xD;
      characteristics of NCC is essential to accurately estimate the burden of the disease in the&#xD;
      community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The epidemiology work package within the human health sector will create awareness of the&#xD;
      size of the problem by delivering scientifically generated prevalence data on TSCT and NCC in&#xD;
      various population groups (adults, children, and those living with epilepsy) in two provinces&#xD;
      of Zambia. This will form an essential prerequisite for the development of public health&#xD;
      policy guidelines for the control/elimination of TSCT/NCC in the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, environmental factors that could play a role in the transmission and maintenance of&#xD;
      T. solium eggs will be studied. This will provide essential data in understanding the&#xD;
      epidemiology of the parasite in endemic regions.&#xD;

        Study participants will be sampled from villages of two districts in Sambia (Gwembe and&#xD;
        Chipata). Villages of these districts will be selected at random and all people from these&#xD;
        villages will be invited to take part in the study. No selection apart from the exclusion&#xD;
        criteria will take place.&#xD;
