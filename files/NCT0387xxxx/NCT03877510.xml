    <measure>Non-motor symptom assessment scale for PD (NMSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>The NMSS is a 9 domain, 30 question scale rating symptom severity on a scale of 0-3 with 3 being most severe; and frequency on a scale of 1-4 with 4 being most frequent. Each question is answered with a severity and frequency rating which are then multiplied. The sum of the products gives the total score. Zero is the best score and 360 is the worst score.</description>
