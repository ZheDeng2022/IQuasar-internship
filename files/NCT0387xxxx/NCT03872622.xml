  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A cohort of CD patients (total n=300) and a cohort of controls (healthy individuals and&#xD;
      family members of CD patients, total n=200) will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will analyze gut host pattern of tissue immune system and epithelial responses to putative&#xD;
      exposome and microbial triggers, expression data in the gut using mRNA expression studies and&#xD;
      genetic analysis of the resident bacterial flora are necessary to identify specific molecules&#xD;
      and signal pathways as well as specific bacterial taxa involved in aberrant response and&#xD;
      instigation of inflammation that is the driver of Crohn's disease. Therefore, We will obtain&#xD;
      stool &amp; blood samples and intestinal biopsy and/or resection specimens from CD patients, and&#xD;
      blood, stool and intestinal biopsy samples from healthy individuals and a-symptomatic family&#xD;
      relatives undergoing colonoscopy for reasons un-related to the study (e.g screening&#xD;
      colonoscopy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients from both cohorts will also undergo environmental and dietary exposure survey. For&#xD;
      environmental exposure, we will use the questionnaire developed by the International&#xD;
      Organization of IBD (IOIBD), with some modification. Questions relate to five main different&#xD;
      areas: (i) Childhood factors up to 20 years; (ii) food habits including daily, weekly or less&#xD;
      frequent consumption; (iii) smoking habits; (iv) sanitary conditions such as the availability&#xD;
      of in-house water tap, hot water tap or flush toilet; and (v) others factors including&#xD;
      physical activity, oral contraceptive pill and stressful events before diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For mapping dietary habits we will employ an interview conducted by a trained dietician and&#xD;
      using the validated structured FFQ (Food frequency Questionnaire).&#xD;

      Only adults&gt;18YO will be included, Two cohorts will be included: A cohort of CD patients&#xD;
      (including specific sub-cohorts of recruited known &amp; new-onset CD and travelling CD patients&#xD;
      and archived pathological specimens of post-operative CD, total n=300) and a cohort of&#xD;
      controls (healthy individuals and family members of CD patients, total n=200). We will obtain&#xD;
      stool &amp; blood samples and intestinal biopsy and/or resection specimens from CD patients, and&#xD;
      blood, stool and intestinal biopsy samples from healthy individuals and a-symptomatic family&#xD;
      relatives undergoing colonoscopy for reasons un-related to the study (e.g screening&#xD;
      colonoscopy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing informed consent, Stool sample and blood sample (20cc) will be obtained.&#xD;
      Enteric infections will be excluded by stool cultures, parasites including entameba, and C.&#xD;
      difficile assay. Inflammatory markers (CRP in blood, calprotectin in stool) will be tested.&#xD;
      Blood samples will undergo immune characterization including in vitro testing by immune cell&#xD;
      activation, cytokine secretion measurements and cell-surface markers analysis by FACS. Two&#xD;
      fecal samples per donor, (≥3g or 3 mL each) will be collected in clean containers at room&#xD;
      temperature, fresh frozen at -20°C and then stored at -80°C within 72h. We will also obtain&#xD;
      at colonoscopy four biopsies from inflamed and non-inflamed ileal and colonic mucosa (total 8&#xD;
      biopsies). From each individual, samples will be divided for analyses at Sheba and for&#xD;
      transfer. Stool will be transferred to Prof. Elinav in Weizmann Institute to perform shotgun&#xD;
      metagenomics of the microbiome. Intestinal biopsy and/or archived resection specimens&#xD;
      (histology) will be transferred to Prof Stappenbeck at Washington University, St. Louis USA,&#xD;
      for histological analysis of innate immune cells and paneth cell morphology analysis by H&amp;E&#xD;
      and immunohistochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ileal and rectal biopsies will be collected and stored immediately in RNAlater. Biopsies will&#xD;
      be obtained from each location (either inflamed or not inflamed, total 8 biopsies) and used&#xD;
      for RNA and for microbial DNA extraction. RNA will be used for mRNAseq of tissue, and DNA for&#xD;
      microbial characterization. mRNAseq will be done at the NIH supported digestive health center&#xD;
      (DHC) core at Cincinnati Children Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), where &gt;700 mRNAseq of&#xD;
      different IBD cohorts including RISK CD and PROTECT UC cohorts were already run with good&#xD;
      results. Microbial 16S amplicon sequencing of stool &amp; biopsy extracted DNA will be done as&#xD;
      previously described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients from both cohorts will also undergo environmental and dietary exposure survey. For&#xD;
      environmental exposure, we will use the questionnaire developed by the International&#xD;
      Organization of IBD (IOIBD), with some modification. The questionnaire consists of 87&#xD;
      questions covering 25 different topics proposed to be environmental risk factors for CD&#xD;
      and/or UC. This questionnaire has been previously used in epidemiological studies&#xD;
      investigating triggers of IBD, including one conducted in South-East Asia and China.&#xD;
      Questions relate to five main different areas: (i) Childhood factors up to 20 years including&#xD;
      breast feeding, appendectomy, tonsillectomy, eczema, vaccinations (tuberculosis, pertussis,&#xD;
      measles, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus, polio), childhood infections (measles, pertussis,&#xD;
      rubella, chickenpox, mumps, scarlet fever) and pet ownership; (ii) food habits including&#xD;
      daily, weekly or less frequent consumption of fruit, vegetables, egg, cereal, bread, cereal,&#xD;
      coffee, tea, juice, sugar and fast food; (iii) smoking habits (current smoker, non-smoker,&#xD;
      ex-smoker); (iv) sanitary conditions such as the availability of in-house water tap, hot&#xD;
      water tap or flush toilet; and (v) others factors including daily physical activity, oral&#xD;
      contraceptive pill and stressful events before diagnosis. We will also add to the IOIBD&#xD;
      questionnaire items pertaining to antibiotic use before and after the age of 15 years, use of&#xD;
      toothpaste and presence of amalgam teeth filling during childhood or later in life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For mapping dietary habits we will employ an interview conducted by a trained dietician and&#xD;
      using the validated structured FFQ (Food frequency Questionnaire). This tool captures &gt;600&#xD;
      food items, prioritized by their pre-defined frequency in regular diet. Personnel will be&#xD;
      trained in the dietary interview method. FFQ results will be further imported into&#xD;
      computerized FFQ version, which automatically derives and normalizes the nutrients content&#xD;
      from an individual patient diet based on known Israel food-items nutrients' database from the&#xD;
      National Institute of Statistics. As shown in the screen-shot figure from this responsive&#xD;
      software for an exemplary patient, each color bar denotes a specific nutrient consumption by&#xD;
      the individual (e.g protein, oligosaccharides, etc), along with its divergence from WHO&#xD;
      normalized consumption (green colored range). The FFQ methodology will be complemented by a&#xD;
      validation prospective three-day dietary itinerary capture by SmartPhone. Participants will&#xD;
      take electronic pictures of all food items consumed during these three day. Photos will be&#xD;
      uploaded to electronic visual data base, and food items will be identified, recorded and&#xD;
      verified against the retrospective FFQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to prioritize among the multiple environmental/dietary factors, we will perform a&#xD;
      systematic review and meta-analysis of all publications pertaining to environmental&#xD;
      risk-factors for CD. We will compute pooled odds ratio and point estimates for each variable,&#xD;
      and define the weighted effects between variables using random effect model. This will enable&#xD;
      to dissect and identify factors which have been most reproducibly and robustly found to be&#xD;
      associated with occurrence of CD. We will then prioritize these variables in a step-wise&#xD;
      manner, for the analysis of environmental factors association with microbiome, transcriptome&#xD;
      and PCP perturbations.&#xD;
