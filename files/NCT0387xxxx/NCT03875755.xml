  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as hyperglycemia first-diagnosed during&#xD;
      pregnancy. Glycemic control reduces GDM-related complications. With the new diagnostic&#xD;
      criteria of GDM, up to 25% of pregnant women have GDM, whereas it was previously 6-10% in&#xD;
      France. Therefore caring for women with GDM is very time-consuming. Therapeutic strategy&#xD;
      includes dietary and lifestyle measures and additional insulin therapy for 15 to 40% of the&#xD;
      women with GDM if the glycemic targets are not achieved after a period of 1 to 2 weeks of&#xD;
      diet. Insulin therapy is imperfect for the following main reasons: need for education (i.e.&#xD;
      subcutaneous administration, dose titration), hypoglycemia and weight gain, limited&#xD;
      acceptance and high cost. Psychosocial deprivation is associated with more cases of GDM and&#xD;
      health accessibility may be unequal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MYO-INOSITOL (MI) is an oral dietary supplement, which reduces insulin resistance. Women with&#xD;
      GDM are deficient in MI. MI supplementation safely prevents GDM by 65 to 87% in high-risk&#xD;
      women. A pilot study has shown a 75% reduction of the need for insulin during GDM not&#xD;
      controlled by diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The coordinator investigator propose here, for the first time, a randomized controlled study&#xD;
      evaluating MI versus placebo in women with newly diagnosed GDM.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, multicenter, superiority, randomised, double blind study with two arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In the 12 participating centers (10 in France and 2 in Belgium): selection of women with&#xD;
           GDM between 11 to 37 (+6 days) amenorrhea weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Explanation of protocol, with signature of consent in case of acceptation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Experimental group: The women will receive 2 caps of MI with acid folic a day,&#xD;
                until delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Control group: The women will receive 2 caps of placebo (containing only acid&#xD;
                folic) a day, until delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
           In both arms, the participants will be routinely followed up during pregnancy:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  diet education,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  self-monitoring of blood glucose before and after meals&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  and during follow-up insulin therapy if glucose value targets are unmet&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Routine monitoring of the women with GDM in both arms, up to delivery, without use of&#xD;
           other oral hypoglycemic agents during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At delivery:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  MI (or placebo) will be stopped&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If applicable, maternal blood samples will be collected at the same time as the&#xD;
                sample routinely collected just before delivery for irregular agglutinin test&#xD;
                measurement, when the women are perfused and cord fluid will be collected at the&#xD;
                same as cord fluid pH is routinely measured just after delivery. The aliquots will&#xD;
                be transported to the &quot;Centre de Ressources Biologiques&quot;(CRB) of the Jean Verdier&#xD;
                Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Events during pregnancy will be collected&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Last visit three months after delivery. Oral glucose tolerance test, anthropometric&#xD;
           measures for women and their child.&#xD;
