  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      this pilot study aims to further explore the potential usage of Fecal microbiota&#xD;
      transplantation in treating constipation and possibly also motor symptoms in Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease (PD) patients, and to increase understanding of the potential relationship between&#xD;
      the identities of intestinal microbial communities and PD.&#xD;

      Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a technique in which intestinal microbiota are&#xD;
      transferred from a healthy donor to the patient, with as primary goal to introduce - or&#xD;
      restore - a stable and 'healthy' microbial community in the gut.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor symptoms and&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal dysfunction, in particular constipation, affects up to 80% of PD patients&#xD;
      and may precede the onset of motor symptoms by years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      this study include one group of PD patients that will receive FMT. two other groups will&#xD;
      serve as controls:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. PD patients that will not receive FMT&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. healthy people who live with PD patients in the same house and share similar surrounding&#xD;
