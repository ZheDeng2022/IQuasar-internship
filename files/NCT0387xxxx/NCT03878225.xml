  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A ketogenic diet (KD) is high in fat and low in carbohydrates and induces ketosis. KD is an&#xD;
      approved non-pharmacological therapy for drug-resistant child epilepsy. Research has shown&#xD;
      that a KD can reduce the behavioral measures of alcohol withdrawal symptomatology in rats.&#xD;
      Ketosis is also possible to achieve without adherence to a KD, by ingestion of a ketogenic&#xD;
      dietary supplement. In this study, we want to investigate if the attenuating effect of the KD&#xD;
      observed in rodents, is also applicable in humans, i.e. whether a ketogenic dietary&#xD;
      supplement, here a ketone monoester, would be effective in suppressing alcohol withdrawal&#xD;
      symptoms in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the effect of a ketogenic dietary supplement on the need for benzodiazepines in&#xD;
      managing alcohol withdrawal syndrome in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults 18-70 years who are alcohol dependent and are seeking treatment for alcohol withdrawal&#xD;
      syndrome in an out-patient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double blinded, randomized clinical trial. The participants will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      either the ketone ester beverage, or a placebo beverage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted over three days (72 hours), with follow-up at 1 month and 1 year&#xD;
      after completion. A sub-set of patients will undergo Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS)&#xD;
      following withdrawal treatment, and again after 1 month.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuroimaging studies have shown that acute alcohol administration decreases glucose&#xD;
      metabolism in the human brain, which was initially thought to reflect decreased brain&#xD;
      function. However, subsequent studies showed that even low doses of alcohol, with minimal&#xD;
      behavioral effects, also decreased baseline brain glucose metabolism and further. This led to&#xD;
      the hypothesis that the reduction in brain glucose metabolism during alcohol intoxication&#xD;
      reflected the brain's utilization of an alternate energy substrate, e.g. the alcohol&#xD;
      metabolite acetate. Acetate is not a ketone body, but biochemically similar to the ketone&#xD;
      bodies, which include acetoacetate, BHB and acetone. Ketone bodies are similarly taken up by&#xD;
      the Monocarboxylate Transporters in neurons, and other brain tissue. A pre-clinical trial has&#xD;
      demonstrated that the implementation of a KD for 10 days significantly reduced the behavioral&#xD;
      measures of alcohol withdrawal symptomatology in rats. In this study, we want to investigate&#xD;
      if the attenuating effect of the KD observed in rodents, is also applicable in humans, i.e.&#xD;
      whether a ketogenic dietary supplement, here a ketone monoester, would be effective in&#xD;
      suppressing alcohol withdrawal symptoms in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will investigate the effect of a five times daily oral administration of a ketone dietary&#xD;
      supplement beverage vs. placebo on the need for benzodiazepines in alcohol withdrawal&#xD;
      syndrome. The KME beverage is a supplement to standardized out-patient alcohol withdrawal&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      36 participants aged 18-70 with a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder according to the DSM-V,&#xD;
      ICD-10, and a previous history of treatment-requiring alcohol withdrawal syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, three-day clinical trial, with an&#xD;
      MRS (Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy) sub-study. The participants will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive either the ketone ester beverage, or a placebo beverage 5 times daily. Participants&#xD;
      will be asked to register benzodiazepine use in a medication-diary during the study.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to self-monitor blood-glucose and ketone levels by use of&#xD;
      fingerstick measurements. During the study patients will be evaluated for withdrawal&#xD;
      severity, and complete questionnaires on alcohol craving, sleep, anxiety and mood.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Randomization will be stratified according to gender and body-weight. The randomization uses stratified permuted block randomization. Selected un-blinded personnel will carry out the randomization procedure. After randomization is carried out, the ketone mono ester or placebo beverages will be delivered to the patients by blinded personnel. Patients, investigators, other caregivers and persons performing data analysis will remain blinded from the time of randomization until the time of database unlock. Un-blinded project personnel will prepare and pack the ketone mono ester/placebo beverage in identical bottles. The placebo beverage will consist of water added with a colorless, bitter flavor enhancer (Bitrex®) and a sweetening agent (Stevia) to approximate the taste of the ketone mono ester beverage as closely as possible.</masking_description>
