    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects of survivin long peptide vaccine and how it works&#xD;
      with the immune system in treating patients with neuroendocrine tumors that have spread to&#xD;
      other parts of the body (metastatic). Tumor cells make proteins that are not usually produced&#xD;
      by normal cells. The body sees these proteins as not belonging and sends white blood cells&#xD;
      called T cells to attack the tumor cells that contain these proteins. By vaccinating with&#xD;
      small pieces of these proteins called peptides, the immune system can be made to kill tumor&#xD;
      cells. Giving survivin long peptide vaccine to patients who have survivin expression in their&#xD;
      tumors may create an immune response in the blood that is directed against neuroendocrine&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess safety, tolerability and toxicity of SVN53-67/M57-KLH peptide vaccine (SurVaxM)&#xD;
      in emulsion with incomplete Freund's adjuvant (montanide ISA 51) and given subcutaneously&#xD;
      with sargramostim (granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF]) in combination&#xD;
      with a somatostatin analogue, octreotide acetate (Sandostatin LAR) in patients with survivin&#xD;
      positive metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine clinical benefit (including complete response, partial response and stable&#xD;
      disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] version [v]1.1)&#xD;
      at 6 months, 9 months and 12 months from study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the immunogenicity of SurVaxM in NETs by measuring anti-survivin antibody&#xD;
      levels and anti-tumor T-cell responses in peripheral blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine time to progression (TTP) compared to prior to study entry, in patients&#xD;
      with metastatic NETs treated with SurVaxM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore immune markers associated with clinical responses to SurVaxM in peripheral&#xD;
      blood of NETs patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive a SVN53-67/M57-KLH peptide vaccine in incomplete Freund's adjuvant&#xD;
      subcutaneously (SC) and sargramostim SC on day 0. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for up to 4&#xD;
      doses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive&#xD;
      octreotide acetate intramuscularly (IM) on day 0. Cycles of octreotide acetate repeat every&#xD;
      28 days for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients&#xD;
      who remain free of tumor progression at 6 months and do not develop any regimen-related&#xD;
      toxicity or serious adverse events will be eligible to receive additional doses of the&#xD;
      vaccine and sargramostim every 3 months, for up to 1 year from the start of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 months.&#xD;

Will be quantified using the observed rates of the adverse events, serious adverse events (SAE) and regimen limiting toxicities. Toxicity rates will be described using upper 1-sided 95% Jeffreys binomial confidence intervals.</description>
