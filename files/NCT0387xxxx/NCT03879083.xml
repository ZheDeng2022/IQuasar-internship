      The palatal rugae, refer to asymmetrical and irregular elevations of the mucosa located in&#xD;
      the anterior third of the palate, on each side of the median palatal raphe and behind the&#xD;
      incisive papilla. The lack of the rugae area on the polished areas of the dentures has been&#xD;
      suggested to impact phonetics in denture patients. Therefore, the aim of this randomized&#xD;
      crossover clinical trial was to compare patients' reported satisfaction with their complete&#xD;
      dentures and oral health related quality of life, when provided with a denture with a&#xD;
      reproduction of their rugae on the anterior palatal area as opposed to a polished palatal&#xD;
      surface.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The use of dentures could impact the patients' phonetics which could impact their speech.&#xD;
      Phonetics could be affected by multiple factors such as having a proper occlusal vertical&#xD;
      dimension, proper occlusal plane, correctly positioned anterior and posterior teeth, and&#xD;
      adequate contouring of the palatal surface. The lack of the rugae area on the polished areas&#xD;
      of the dentures has been also suggested to impact phonetics in denture patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The palatal rugae, refer to asymmetrical and irregular elevations of the mucosa located in&#xD;
      the anterior third of the palate, on each side of the median palatal raphe and behind the&#xD;
      incisive papilla. In addition to enhancing phonetics, the precise reproduction of the rugae&#xD;
      in the complete dentures has been suggested to enhance mastication, deglutition and better&#xD;
      taste perception. However, these suggestions were based on empirical evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have described methods for replicating the patients rague on complete dentures,&#xD;
      however there are no clinical study to ascertain or negate the impact of this procedure.&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this randomized crossover clinical trial was to compare patients'&#xD;
      reported satisfaction with their complete dentures and oral health related quality of life,&#xD;
      when provided with a denture with a reproduction of their rugae on the anterior palatal area&#xD;
      as opposed to a polished palatal surface. The null hypothesis was that there would be no&#xD;
      difference in patients' reported satisfaction rate using visual analogue scale (VAS) and Oral&#xD;
      Health Impact Profile for Edentulous Patients (OHIP-EDENT) Questionnaire response between the&#xD;
      two types of palatal contours after using each type for one month post-delivery.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will randomly be allocated to either group A/B or B/A. Group A: Patients receiving a reproduction of their palatal rugae Group B: Patients receiving a smooth palatal surface.&#xD;
After insertion, all participants will be followed up for a minimum of 1 week to correct any issues with the dentures and eliminate patient complaints.&#xD;
All patients will be recalled at 2 month after insertion to answer questions using the VAS and to fill out the Oral Health Impact Profile-20 EDENT (OHIP-EDENT), and receive the other type of palatal contour.&#xD;
After the second periodthe same process will be repeated.</intervention_model_description>
