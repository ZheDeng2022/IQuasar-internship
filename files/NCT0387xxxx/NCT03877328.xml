      This would be a single center, parallel, two group randomized controlled pilot study that is&#xD;
      designed to assess the feasibility and efficacy of the Virtual Coach Program in elderly&#xD;
      patients with heart failure. Sixteen (16) subjects will be enrolled to allow 8 subjects to be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to each arm. The study will be conducted in Thessaloniki/Greece. The study&#xD;
      is expected to complete enrollment in approximately 3 months. Participants will be randomly&#xD;
      randomized to either the intervention group (use of Virtual Coach program and usual care) or&#xD;
      the control group (use of usual care alone) after successfully fulfilling all inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria.&#xD;

    <description>A group of thirty subjects diagnosed with heart failure (HF) of any etiology undergo an experimental procedure in the following order: resting-state (eyes-closed), passively viewing thirty two agents which are grouped with respect to different appearance characteristics and passively viewing combinations of virtual agents. During the experiment, brain activity, heart rate, skin conductance, temperature and eye-gaze biosignals are collected by means of electroencephalography, Empatica E4 and Gazepoint. Subsequently, a prospective cohort study is performed in a subgroup of ten participants which undergo a three additive stage procedure. Stage 1, a wearable monitoring device (Wavelet Health) is given in order to provide objective information on the patient's activity. Stage 2, the FitForAll physical exercise program is introduced. Stage 3, introduces the coaching aspects, where personalized recommendations and suggestions are delivered through home surfaces' projection.</description>
