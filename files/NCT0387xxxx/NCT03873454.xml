  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this trial is that listening to music will decrease the stress levels that&#xD;
      patients face as evidenced by their STAI scores, salivary cortisol levels and intra-operative&#xD;
      autonomic parameters.&#xD;

      This randomized control trial was conducted from May- July 2014 across National University&#xD;
      Hospital and Singapore National Eye Centre. All the patients of 10 consultants and senior&#xD;
      consults and X medical officers were included in the study. A total of 148 participants were&#xD;
      surveyed, and a total of X saliva samples were collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criterion for patients was cataract surgery patients aged 50 years and above,&#xD;
      with an acceptable hearing level based on CALFRAST hearing and the ability to wear clip-on&#xD;
      on-ear headphones without discomfort. They were required to be mentally and physically&#xD;
      capable of informed consent. Patients were also required to be ASA Grade 3 or lower.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criterion for surgeons was surgeons doing phacoemulsification cataract surgeries,&#xD;
      and for anaesthetists, the inclusion criteria was anaesthetists using only minimal sedation&#xD;
      for the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria was severe/profound hearing impairments, patients with intellectual&#xD;
      disabilities, patients on psychotropic medications or drugs affecting mood or hemodynamic&#xD;
      status, ASA grade 4 and parturients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criterion for surgeons included ECCE procedures. Exclusion criteria for&#xD;
      anaesthetists was anaesthetists using moderate sedation, or who used non-standard drugs&#xD;
      including Droperidol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the NHG Domain-Specific Institutional Review Board and the Singhealth Institutional&#xD;
      Review Board approved the study in May 2014, and all ethical consideration complied with.&#xD;
      Written informed consent was sought prior to the questionnaire administration, and&#xD;
      participants were allowed to withdraw from the study at any time during data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study had 3 arms- an experimental group of patients who listened to music via headphones,&#xD;
      a first control group of patients who wore earphones but did not listen to music, and a&#xD;
      second control group of patients who neither listened to music nor wore headphones. All&#xD;
      patients were assigned a study number and no patient identifiers were noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 hour before the procedure, study participants were approached to do an anonymous survey.&#xD;
      Patients were then asked to produce a saliva sample by pooling saliva under the tongue for 5&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, patients in the experimental group choose one of 30 playlists; if a patient did not&#xD;
      find a playlist to their satisfaction, Spotifiy® was used to generate a new playlist.&#xD;
      Patients were also allowed to listen to their preferred local radio station. Music was played&#xD;
      using wireless headphones synced with a Jabra® Bluetooth device which was clipped onto the&#xD;
      patients OT gown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-operatively, both the surgeon and anaesthetist were blinded to what arm of the study&#xD;
      the patient was undergoing. Autonomic parameters (blood pressure, Mean Arterial Pressure,&#xD;
      Respiratory Rate and Heart Rate) as well as dosages of drugs administered (anxiolytics,&#xD;
      sedatives, anaesthetics, any other drugs used). The total time for the procedure was noted.&#xD;
      Post-operatively, the surgeon was surveyed for complexity of the case and ease of&#xD;
      communication with the patient, whilst the anaesthetist was surveyed for depth of anaesthesia&#xD;
      and ease of communication with the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 minutes post-procedurally, the patient was surveyed again and saliva samples were&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
