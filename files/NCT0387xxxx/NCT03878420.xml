    <textblock>
      This study is a double-masked, sham-controlled, parallel design, prospective multi-site study&#xD;
      for the use of PBM as a treatment for visual impairment in subjects with dry AMD. The target&#xD;
      enrollment is 96 subjects in up to 10 centers in Europe, randomized at a 1:2 ratio into 2&#xD;
      groups: Sham Treatment (S-1) and PBM Treatment (T-2). Once 96 subjects have been enrolled in&#xD;
      the study, if there are less than 144 eyes that qualify for the study, additional subjects&#xD;
      will be enrolled until 144 eyes have been included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      S-1 will receive 3 sham treatments per week over 3 to 5 weeks starting at Baseline and&#xD;
      starting again at Months 4 and 8. T-2 will receive 3 PBM treatments per week over 3 to 5&#xD;
      weeks starting at Baseline and starting again at Months 4 and 8. Each treatment series will&#xD;
      total 9 treatments. Neither the subject nor the study staff will know which treatment the&#xD;
      subject has been assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive standard visual outcome measurements including Early Treatment Diabetic&#xD;
      Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) BCVA, CSV-1000E contrast sensitivity (CS) and the Radner Reading&#xD;
      Test prior to and following each treatment series as well as eye exams, fundus photographs,&#xD;
      Heidelberg OCT and FAF imaging and optional Optos Ultra Wide Field (UWF) imaging of the&#xD;
      retina at selected time intervals. Subjects will also complete the Visual Function&#xD;
      Questionnaire 25 (VFQ-25) at selected time intervals.&#xD;

             dry AMD, has not been stabilized for a minimum of 1 month prior to Screening. Subjects&#xD;
             are considered to be stable if they are taking the AREDS supplements consistently as&#xD;
             prescribed by their treating doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received Low Vision Rehab/Therapy within 30 days prior to Screening or intends to&#xD;
