  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Problems with blood sugar metabolism (i.e., metabolic dysfunction) progressively develop&#xD;
      through old age, which is primarily due to obesity and lack of physical activity. Metabolic&#xD;
      dysfunction increases the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and negatively impacts memory and&#xD;
      related brain function. There is intense interest in developing interventions, particularly&#xD;
      non-drug therapies, to combat AD. Recent clinical trials have found that intranasal insulin,&#xD;
      which facilitates glucose metabolism in the brain, is able to maintain memory in participants&#xD;
      with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), the precursor to AD. While intranasal insulin is a&#xD;
      useful, proof-of-concept intervention, it does not affect visceral fat mass and therefore&#xD;
      metabolic dysfunction will persist in a given person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators wish to engage participants with MCI in intermittent calorie restriction&#xD;
      (CR), to reduce metabolic dysfunction and improve glucose metabolism. Intermittent calorie&#xD;
      restriction in this case refers to eating whatever one wants for 5 days, followed by 2&#xD;
      consecutive days of consuming 530 calories via one protein shake with sufficient nutrients to&#xD;
      sustain the person. This results in reliable weight loss, which itself improves glucose&#xD;
      metabolism in the body and has a wealth of other benefits. (It should be mentioned here that&#xD;
      weight maintenance has been shown in studies when participants restrict to 1 day/week).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AD diagnosis is projected to increase from approximately 5 million to 13.8 million Americans&#xD;
      by 2050. The Alzheimer's Association estimates that healthcare costs for AD by 2050 could be&#xD;
      1.2 trillion dollars per year for Americans aged 65 years or older. There is marked focus on&#xD;
      treating AD during the MCI phase, which precedes AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the brain, insulin normally facilitates microvascular blood flow, glucose uptake, and&#xD;
      glucose oxidation for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation. Insulin resistance (IR) is&#xD;
      defined as a reduced cellular responsiveness to insulin, characterized by higher insulin&#xD;
      levels needed to maintain glucose regulation in the periphery and certain brain areas. IR is&#xD;
      found in MCI and AD patient brains. AD-related neuropathology, such as amyloid&#xD;
      beta-containing plaques, progressive atrophy, and glucose hypometabolism first occur in brain&#xD;
      areas that also have a high density of insulin receptors. Such areas include medial temporal&#xD;
      lobe (MTL) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Furthermore, as illustrated in the literature and&#xD;
      previous work of the investigators, peripheral IR is associated with AD-like changes in MTL&#xD;
      and PFC, including: 1) brain atrophy; 2) less glucose uptake; 3) accumulation of&#xD;
      amyloid-beta, a hallmark of AD; and 4) increased phosphorylation of tau fibrils, another&#xD;
      hallmark of AD. Finally, higher IR is related to deficits in memory performance and executive&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These cognitive deficits can be ameliorated with 40 IU of intranasal insulin, which increases&#xD;
      insulin processing in the brain with minimal peripheral effects, where MCI and AD patients&#xD;
      show stable visuospatial working memory, as well as declarative learning and memory. One&#xD;
      limitation of intranasal insulin is that it does not change obesity, which causes IR, and may&#xD;
      therefore be only temporarily effective. As such, the investigators are interested in dietary&#xD;
      regimens that can lower IR and may have long-term beneficial effects on AD neuropathology and&#xD;
      cognitive output. Critically, intermittent calorie restriction (CR) diets reliably decrease&#xD;
      body weight and IR in human adults. Intermittent CR protects neurons against dysfunction and&#xD;
      degeneration in AD models. The underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms involve improved&#xD;
      cellular bioenergetics and up-regulation of protein chaperones and antioxidant pathways in&#xD;
      neurons. For example, 5-2 CR, a diet consisting of 5 days ad libitum followed by 2&#xD;
      consecutive days consuming 500-600 kcal, decreases IR beyond what is achieved with daily CR,&#xD;
      and has a compliance rate of 83% versus 55% even by 6 months. It is also important to mention&#xD;
      that no serious Adverse Events have occurred during past 5-2 CR studies.&#xD;

The accuracy range is 0-100% and the reaction time range is 500-3000 milliseconds. Higher accuracy is better and higher reaction time is worse. A composite sub-scale of performance is created basically based on log-rescaled median reaction time and accuracy. The range is 0-10. A higher number is better.
