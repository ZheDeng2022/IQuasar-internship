  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to evaluate clinical predictors of intracranial bleeding in elderly&#xD;
      patients who present to the emergency department (ED) after a fall. The aim is to assess&#xD;
      feasibility and rate of patient recruitment, patient follow up, and to establish a point&#xD;
      estimate for the incidence of intracranial bleeding in the investigator's population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there are no guidelines for ED physicians to assess the pretest probability of&#xD;
      intracranial bleed in these patients, and no safe way to exclude a bleed without CT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seniors account for 15% of the Canadian population. The proportion will greatly increase over&#xD;
      the next few years. Elderly people attend the ED more often than younger people, and they&#xD;
      often come to the ED after a fall at home or outside. Falling is associated with head&#xD;
      injuries, which cause half of all the deaths from falling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Head injuries are diagnosed with CT scans. In the ED, it can be difficult for the physician&#xD;
      to know when to perform a CT scan of the head. It can be hard to know if the elderly person&#xD;
      hit their head, and often times, people with bleeding in the head can have a normal&#xD;
      examination. The Investigators think that the overall risk of bleeding in the head in elderly&#xD;
      who fall is between 3 and 10%. If emergency physicians scanned every senior who fell, only a&#xD;
      few would show bleeding, the scanning department would be overwhelmed, there would be&#xD;
      increased costs for the hospital and longer delays for patients. It is important for&#xD;
      physicians to diagnose a serious head injury as there are lifesaving treatments that can be&#xD;
      given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators plan to develop a decision rule for emergency physicians that would inform&#xD;
      them which patients should have a CT scan of the head and which patients can have a serious&#xD;
      head injury safely ruled out without a CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators propose to identify and recruit patients over the age of 65 who come to the&#xD;
      Hamilton General or Juravinski Emergency departments after falling. Patients and their&#xD;
      caregivers will be consented for a telephone follow-up call after 6 weeks. Data collected&#xD;
      will include patient characteristics, general health, and blood test results which might be&#xD;
      predictors of a serious head injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators will develop a tool to help emergency physicians to order a CT scan on the&#xD;
      right patients.&#xD;
