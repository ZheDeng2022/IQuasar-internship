      Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Sintilimab Combined with Metformin Hydrochloride in&#xD;

      This study is an open-label, single-arm, phase II clinical study on the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of Sintilimab combined with metformin in the treatment of locally advanced, recurrent or&#xD;
      metastatic NSCLC patients who fail to receive first-line platinum-containing chemotherapy in&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer in China.&#xD;
      Simon two stages optimal design criteria are used in the test, and 18 subjects are enrolled&#xD;
      in the first stage, and if two or more patients reach the PR/CR evaluation criteria, the&#xD;
      sample size will be increased to 43. If 7 or more of the 43 subjects meets the PR/CR&#xD;
      evaluation criteria, it indicates that the test achieves the expected results. After the&#xD;
      subject signs the informed consent, the subject will receive the treatment of 200 mg IV Q3W&#xD;
      (3 weeks using a) of Sintilimab combine with 500mg of metformin for oral bid until disease&#xD;
      progression, death, toxicity intolerance, withdrawal of the informed consent, initiation of&#xD;
      new anti-tumor treatment or termination of treatment for other reasons specified in the&#xD;
      program. The longest duration of treatment for Sintilimab is 24 months. The main endpoint of&#xD;
      the study is ORR evaluated by the researchers based on RECIST v1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECIST v1.1 is used for clinical tumor imaging evaluation. Based on the clinical conditions&#xD;
      of the patients, it is used every 2 cycles (±7 days) until disease progression, initiation of&#xD;
      new anti-tumor therapy, withdrawal of Inform Consent Form (ICF) or death of the subjects. For&#xD;
      the first time, if the clinical status of the subjects with disease progression is stable,&#xD;
      those who meet the criteria determined by the investigator can continue to receive treatment&#xD;
      of Sintilimab combined with metformin, and must undergo imaging evaluation after 4 weeks (± 7&#xD;
      days) to confirm the disease progression. Patients with disease progression will enter the&#xD;
      survival follow-up stage (every 60 ± 7 days); Patients who stop treatment due to other causes&#xD;
      other than disease progression will continue to receive the tumor assessment every 6 weeks (±&#xD;
      7 days) until the next event (initiation of new anti-tumor treatment, disease progression,&#xD;
      withdrawal of ICF or death), and then enter the survival follow-up stage (every 60 ± 7 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will evaluate and manage the adverse reactions during the treatment period&#xD;
      and within 30 ± 7 days after the last use of the study drug in accordance with the NCI Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 4.0 and immune-related adverse reactions&#xD;
      standard Immune-Related Response Criteria (irRC), evaluation and management of severe adverse&#xD;
      reactions during the treatment period and 90 ± 7 days after the last use of the study drug&#xD;
      (unless patients start new anti-tumor treatment 31 to 90 days after the last use of the study&#xD;
      drug).&#xD;
