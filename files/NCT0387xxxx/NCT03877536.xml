      This study will evaluate the virologic effect, safety and tolerability of Genvoya® in adults&#xD;
      during early acute HIV infection.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label study to describe the effects of early antiretroviral (ART)&#xD;
      therapy on 1) viral load, 2) safety and tolerability of Genvoya®, 3) clinical outcomes and&#xD;
      secondarily on HIV-specific immune responses. This study is a sub-study of RV 217 that will&#xD;
      recruit participants with incident HIV diagnoses from the parent RV 217 cohort. Potential RV&#xD;
      392 volunteers will be recruited from the RV 217 ECHO cohort if they have been diagnosed with&#xD;
      incident HIV Infection. Screening procedures for HIV in RV 217 are designed to identify&#xD;
      participants during acute HIV infection (AHI) or early HIV infection. Participants will&#xD;
      initiate Genvoya®, a once a day antiretroviral pill within 1 week of enrollment. RV 392&#xD;
      follow-up visits will largely overlap with RV 217 visits for the study duration of 96 weeks,&#xD;
      but additional visits will occur early after initiation of Genvoya®. RV 392 participants will&#xD;
      remain co-enrolled in RV 217 (i.e., RV 217 visits also continue); blood collection will be&#xD;
      coordinated by the RV 392 team by prioritizing safety labs and then research labs within the&#xD;
      allotted blood volumes while still meeting scientific objectives for both RV 217 and RV 392.&#xD;
      Blood tests that are required for both protocols will only be collected once and will not be&#xD;
      duplicated across the two protocols.&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Adequate renal function: estimated creatine clearance of &gt;50 mL/min according to the&#xD;
             Cockroft Gault formula 2 weeks prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Urine clean catch: glucose &lt; trace and protein &lt;1+ or as per site-specification 2&#xD;

&#xD;
        Commits to continued use of adequate birth control method for 96 weeks of the study and&#xD;

        skin, surgical methods (hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation), condoms, diaphragms,&#xD;
        intrauterine device (IUD), or abstinence. If depending on hormonal contraception, check&#xD;
        package insert for drug interactions and/or consider adding a second barrier method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any chronic or clinically significant medical condition that in the opinion of&#xD;
             investigator would jeopardize the safety or rights of the volunteer, including but not&#xD;

             forms of drug or alcohol abuse, mental illness, severe asthma, psychiatric disorders,&#xD;
             heart disease, or cancer; or a physical finding on examination considered indicative&#xD;
             of significant disease such as murmur (other than functional), hepatosplenomegaly,&#xD;
             focal neurological deficit, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Untreated AIDS-related opportunistic infection&#xD;
&#xD;

             and the package insert&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Women who are breast-feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        There are no inclusion/exclusion criteria based on CD4 count because CD4 count can be&#xD;
        transiently diminished during acute HIV infection and ART initiation during early or acute&#xD;
        HIV infection offers the potential benefit of limiting reservoir seeding and preventing&#xD;
        immune destruction regardless of peripheral CD4 count at the time of treatment initiation.&#xD;
