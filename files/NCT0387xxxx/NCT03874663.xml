      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the acceptability and performance of a directly&#xD;
      assisted oral HIV self-testing (HIVST) program in a youth population aged 14-24 in Nigeria.&#xD;
      The study is oral HIV self-testing (HIVST) program in a youth population aged 14-24 in&#xD;
      Nigeria. The study is focused on assessing young people's ability to correctly perform the&#xD;
      test.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nigerian youth aged 14-24 make up a significant proportion of Sub-Saharan African youth newly&#xD;
      diagnosed with HIV. However, they do not access essential HIV prevention services, like&#xD;
      routine HIV testing, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and sexually transmitted infection (STI)&#xD;
      testing.This is partly explained by barriers that are individual (fear, and low perceived&#xD;
      risk), social (insufficient social support) and structural (poor access to testing) factors.&#xD;
      Additionally, the most affected groups of young people have remained largely unreached by&#xD;
      traditional HIV testing services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV self-testing (HIVST) can mitigate some of these barriers by decentralizing HIV&#xD;
      testing,decreasing stigma, and linking HIV-negative individuals with preventive services.&#xD;
      HIVST is a process in which a person collects his or her own specimen (oral fluid or blood)&#xD;
      using a simple rapid HIV test and then performs the test and interprets the result, often in&#xD;
      a private setting, either alone or with someone he or she trusts. HIVST offers an alternative&#xD;
      to facility-based HIV testing services, particularly for youth populations who may fear to&#xD;
      get tested for HIV due to stigma and discrimination. Recognizing the expanding evidence&#xD;
      supporting the effectiveness of HIVST, particularly the OraQuick HIV self-testing kits (see&#xD;
      Tun et al, 2018; Nagendo et al., 2017; Kurth et al., 2016; Choko et al., 2016; and WHO&#xD;
      pre-qualification report under the Publications Tab), the World Health Organization released&#xD;
      HIVST guidelines in 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is in part with a parent study called ITEST (Innovative Tools to Expand HIV&#xD;
      Self-Testing) aimed at developing and implementing innovative youth-friendly HIV self-testing&#xD;
      services through open challenges and apprenticeships that provides youth opportunities to&#xD;
      learn about social problems (like HIV) that affect their lives and then propose actions to&#xD;
      address these problems, informed by the youth participatory action research framework (YPAR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent study conducted in Nigeria, already demonstrate the feasibility and acceptability of&#xD;
      HIVST among 257 men sleeping with men (MSMs) in Nigeria (see paper by Tun, 2018). In that&#xD;
      study, 97% reported using the HIVST kits. Almost all participants reported that the HIVST kit&#xD;
      instructions were easy or somewhat easy to understand (99.6%) and perform the test&#xD;
      (98.0%).The most common reasons they liked the test were ease of use (87.3%),&#xD;
      confidentiality/privacy (82.1%), convenience (74.1%) and absence of needle pricks (64.9%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However given the need for youth friendly HIV testing services that are accessible,&#xD;
      acceptable, appropriate and effective to address the specialized needs of young people and&#xD;
      the public health implications of unknown HIV status, especially among young people, the&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the acceptability and performance of directly assisted&#xD;
      oral HIVST in a youth population in Nigeria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that oral HIV self-testing is a new testing approach in Nigeria, there is a strong need&#xD;
      for more research to be done to provide evidence of its acceptability in the general&#xD;
      population. Currently, there has been one completed study that assessed the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of HIVST; however, this was conducted among a sub-population group (Men who&#xD;
      have sex with Men) [Tun et. al., 2018]. Thus, this study seeks to examine in a general&#xD;
      population of adolescents and young people, the acceptability and performance of oral HIV&#xD;
      self-testing and the factors that influence acceptability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study participants will be recruited from a health facility in Nigeria as well as from&#xD;
           local college campuses and other youth-friendly community settings in Nigeria. At the&#xD;
           health facilities, study flyers with mobile phone contact numbers will be used to&#xD;
           recruit participants along with provider word of mouth. At the schools and college&#xD;
           campuses, and community settings, research assistants will introduce the study and&#xD;
           participants between the ages of 14-24 will be invited to participate in the study. All&#xD;
           participants recruited at the health facility, schools, college campuses, and community&#xD;
           settings will be given written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Following informed consent, study staff will administer a pre-HIV testing questionnaire&#xD;
           to collect basic demographic information and assess HIV test history, sexual behavior&#xD;
           history, HIV self-testing knowledge, importance, confidence, and concerns with&#xD;
           performing the test. Respondents will be given a tablet computer-assisted survey&#xD;
           instrument (CASI) due to the sensitive nature of some of questions by NIMR research&#xD;
           assistant and are able to enter their responses themselves. This is thought to increase&#xD;
           the validity of responses, as respondents are more likely to give truthful answers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Next, instructions on how to perform the oral HIVST using OraQuick Rapid HIV 1‚ÅÑ2&#xD;
           Antibody, (OraSure Technologies), a rapid oral fluid test kit approved by FDA to detect&#xD;
           HIV antibodies, will be given in person to each participant by the research assistant.&#xD;
           The research assistant will show a short professionally developed video to introduce the&#xD;
           concept of HIVST. The use of the video will allow us to standardize information provided&#xD;
           to participants and limit discrepancies in the content and quality of the information&#xD;
           provided. Pictorial information on how to perform the test will also be provided to&#xD;
           participants. Instructions on how to perform the test will be repeated if asked by&#xD;
           participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Next, participants perform the oral HIVST in the privacy of a separate room or mobile&#xD;
           tent-set up. After completion of the test, participants take a photograph of their test&#xD;
           results. The photographs of the test result will be taken using a study issued tablet.&#xD;
           To login to the tablet, each participant will be provided with a unique login number&#xD;
           which corresponds to the ID on their pre and post test. By using the photo verification&#xD;
           component, we seek to examine whether they can correctly perform the test on their own&#xD;
           and interpret the result, as intended. The trained research assistant will record the&#xD;
           results as captured in the photo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Next the trained research assistant from our partner organization, the Nigerian&#xD;
           Institute of Medical Research (NIMR), will perform a confirmatory finger prick HIV test&#xD;
           according to the national standards using the Determine and Uni-Gold in parallel as per&#xD;
           the Nigerian HIV testing country guidelines. In a case where a participant test positive&#xD;
           for HIV using the the HIVST kit, confirmatory testing will be available to the&#xD;
           participant at the same location immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Finally, study participants will complete a post-test questionnaire to capture perceived&#xD;
           acceptability of HIVST and whether they had any problems performing oral HIVST.&#xD;
           Respondents will complete survey on a tablet computer-assisted survey instrument (CASI)&#xD;
           due to the sensitive nature of some of questions by NIMR research assistant and are able&#xD;
           to enter their responses themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will adhere to the WHO five key components-the &quot;5 Cs&quot;-that must be respected and adhered&#xD;
      to by all HIV Testing services. These components are: Consent Confidentiality Counselling&#xD;
      Correct test results Connection/linkage to prevention, care and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The five Cs, and the key principles they entail include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. People being tested for HIV must give informed consent to be tested. They must be&#xD;
           informed of the process for HTC, the services that will be available depending on the&#xD;
           results, and their right to refuse testing. Mandatory or compulsory (coerced) testing is&#xD;
           never appropriate, regardless of where that coercion comes from: health-care providers,&#xD;
           partners, family members, employers, or others.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Testing services must be confidential, meaning that the content of discussions between&#xD;
           the person tested and the health-care worker, testing provider, or counselor, as well as&#xD;
           the test results, will not be disclosed to anyone else without the consent of the person&#xD;
           tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Testing services must be accompanied by appropriate and high-quality pre-test&#xD;
           information or pre-test counselling, and post-test counselling. Given that the&#xD;
           confirmatory testing will be administered immediately at the testing site, our partners&#xD;
           NIMR, a PEPFAR supported site will provide pre- and post-test counseling following&#xD;
           regulations in Nigeria. NIMR is a PEPFAR Support HIV Care Services in Lagos, Nigeria&#xD;
           providing care since 2003 for over 24,000 individuals living with HIV in Lagos, Nigeria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Provision of correct test results. Testing must be performed and quality assurance&#xD;
           measures followed according to internationally-recognized testing strategies, norms, and&#xD;
           standards based on the type of epidemic. Results must be communicated to the person&#xD;
           tested unless that person refuses the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Connections to HIV prevention, treatment and care and support services should be&#xD;
           supported through concrete and well-resourced patient referral, support, and/or tracking&#xD;
           systems.&#xD;
