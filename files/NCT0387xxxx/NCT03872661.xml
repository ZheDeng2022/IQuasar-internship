      The purpose of this study is to studying neoadjuvant IBI308, bevacizumab, plus pemetrexed and&#xD;
      carboplatin followed by surgery to see how well it works in treating patients with&#xD;
      unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the recommended therapeutic approach for patients with&#xD;
      unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), although surgery offers the chance&#xD;
      of cure. With combined-modality therapy with radiation therapy and chemotherapy, the&#xD;
      prognosis of stage III NSCLC remains poor. IBI308 (sintilimab) is a recombinant humanized&#xD;
      anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody. This study is to studying neoadjuvant IBI308, bevacizumab,&#xD;
      plus pemetrexed and carboplatin followed by surgery to see how well it works in treating&#xD;
      patients with unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

    <description>Neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery. Neoadjuvant therapy included four drugs. IBI308 was given 200 mg iv infusion on day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 cycles; bevacizumab was administered at a dose of 15 mg/kg; pemetrexed was given 500 mg/m^2 i.v. injection on day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 cycles; carboplatin was given dosed to an area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) of 5 i.v. on day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 cycles. Surgery will be performed at least 21 days after the last dose of neoadjuvant therapy.</description>
