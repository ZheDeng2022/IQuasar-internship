      An evaluation and comparison of results between the 'Accuscreen New' currently in use and an&#xD;
      'Accuscreen New' with different settings to see if the new settings reduce unnecessary&#xD;
      referrals for babies from newborn hearing screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Babies will be tested with the standard and modified equipment. Referrals for diagnostic&#xD;
      testing will be based on the standard equipment. A comparison in referrals between the&#xD;
      standard and modified equipment will be made.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All newborn babies undergo hearing screening, usually within the first few days of life and&#xD;
      some are tested with the automated auditory brainstem response test (AABR). This involves&#xD;
      recording activity from the hearing nerve and parts of the brainstem from three small sensors&#xD;
      placed on the baby's head and neck when a series of clicking sounds are played in to the ear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In March 2015 we started using an 'Accuscreen New' to record the AABR, which is approved by&#xD;
      the Newborn Hearing Screening Programme (NHSP) and used widely across the UK. However, since&#xD;
      introducing the new equipment the 'screen refer' rate increased significantly in very young&#xD;
      babies (less than 48 hours old) and diagnostic testing showed they had satisfactory hearing.&#xD;
      The impact of the increased referral rate caused increased delays on diagnostic testing and&#xD;
      also lead to unnecessarily increased parental anxiety in relation to the hearing of their new&#xD;
      born baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The equipment suppliers (GN Otometrics) and the NHSP Programme centre have agreed to an&#xD;
      evaluation and comparison of results between the 'Accuscreen New' currently in use and an&#xD;
      'Accuscreen New' with different settings which we believe will reduce unnecessary referrals&#xD;
      of so many young babies to Audiology (the modified equipment will test for up to 10 minutes&#xD;
      to see if a response is present, instead of stopping after one or two minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Babies will be tested with the standard and modified equipment. Referrals for diagnostic&#xD;
      testing will be based on the standard equipment. A comparison in referrals between the&#xD;
      standard and modified equipment will be made.&#xD;
