  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perioperative pain and fear in children is an important health problem in our society, both&#xD;
      at the time of surgery and in their future life. Nonetheless, the management of perioperative&#xD;
      pain and fear in children is still challenging and poorly addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bad management of perioperative pain and fear can lead to traumatic events. This might result&#xD;
      in an increased morbidity and mortality on the long term, as these patients do wait&#xD;
      significantly longer than control subjects to consult medical services (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous evidence has shown that preoperative fear, in both children and parents, is a&#xD;
      significant determinant of perioperative pain (2). Other studies revealed that pain and fear&#xD;
      are strongly related; higher preoperative stress can result in higher postoperative pain&#xD;
      scores (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This shows the need for a constructive, effective and clear tool to guide children through&#xD;
      their perioperative experience. Mindbytes created a serious game, &quot;SERES Pain in Children&quot;,&#xD;
      to address this need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious gaming is a way of learning, training and educating using gaming principles. Young&#xD;
      persons, growing up around computers, are especially eligible for gaming. Therefore serious&#xD;
      gaming is a strategy to catch their attention and educate them in a playful manner. Serious&#xD;
      gaming is even incorporated in higher education and corporate entities. There are also a few&#xD;
      examples of serious games for training healthcare providers, supporting patients in their&#xD;
      therapy, disease management or even to promote healthy wellness and lifestyle to the broader&#xD;
      public (4,5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;SERES Pain in Children&quot;-game is created with realistic scenarios based on scientific&#xD;
      literature about perioperative pain and fear in children. The primary goal of the game is to&#xD;
      provide the children insight in the impact of their personal choices on their well-being and&#xD;
      on their environment by giving the children information about the day of the surgery. The&#xD;
      ultimate aim of the game is to create a change in behaviour, enhance children's coping&#xD;
      strategies and reduce the burden of pain and fear in the children and parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of the implementation&#xD;
      of an interactive preparative 'serious' game to decrease the perioperative distress in&#xD;
      children. Our aim is to validate this game by investigating the level of discomfort in&#xD;
      children and care providers who played the game before surgery compared to control subjects&#xD;
      who did not play the game.&#xD;

    <description>Children were asked to scale their pain using the WBFPRS once they were awake and responsive (15 minutes after they were back in their room). The WBFPRS is used to assess pain in children and help them communicate about it [26]. The WBFPRS, which is an auto-evaluation scale, has six faces representing &quot;no pain&quot; (0) to &quot;worst pain ever&quot;.</description>

Additionally, parents were asked to which extent they would recommend CliniPup to peers and a net-promoter score (NPS) was calculated.</description>

    <description>The interactive game is played at home by the children on a computer or tablet before the surgery. The &quot;SERES Pain in Children&quot;-game is created with realistic scenarios based on scientific literature about perioperative pain and fear in children. The primary goal of the game is to provide the children insight in the impact of their personal choices on their well-being and on their environment by giving the children information about the day of the surgery. The ultimate aim of the game is to create a change in behaviour, enhance children's coping strategies and reduce the burden of pain and fear in the children and parents.</description>
