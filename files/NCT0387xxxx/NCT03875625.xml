      The study is aimed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To quantify the change of adipose tissues, triglyceride in liver and pancreas and&#xD;
           cholesterol after lifestyle intervention or bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test the hypothesis that Brown fat is an independent biomarker for the development of&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is associated with different chronic disorders such as metabolic syndrome,&#xD;
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). It can be&#xD;
      classified into mild, moderate and severe using different cut-off values of body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI). Many interventions and treatments against obesity have been proposed. Patients with&#xD;
      mild to moderate obesity are suggested to undergo lifestyle monitoring or intervention&#xD;
      programs while patients with severe or morbid obesity may be suggested to undergo bariatric&#xD;
      surgery. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a specific type of adipose tissue with unique ability&#xD;
      to produce heat by non-shivering thermogenesis. It increases energy expenditure and lower&#xD;
      blood glucose levels and therefore it is suggested to be a potential therapy against obesity,&#xD;
      NAFLD, DM2 etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research studies demonstrated that obesity is strongly associated with NAFLD. From our&#xD;
      previous observation, most obese individuals suffer from NAFLD. Nevertheless, a small portion&#xD;
      of them are protected from NAFLD. We try to understand why and how this small portion of&#xD;
      severe obese patients can keep themselves protected from NAFLD while some lean individual&#xD;
      suffers from it. We would also like to test whether the amount of BAT is a biomarker for&#xD;
      NAFLD. Besides, we would like to validate the accuracy of liver inflammation and fibrosis&#xD;
      (LIF) scores with liver biopsy results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The change of adipose tissues (i.e. brown, subcutaneous, visceral), triglyceride in liver and&#xD;
      pancreas and cholesterol (i.e. HDL and LDL) in bloodstream would be measured in patients with&#xD;
      NAFLD who undergo either bariatric surgery or lifestyle intervention. 40 subjects will be&#xD;
      recruited. Half of them for the lifestyle intervention group while half for the bariatric&#xD;
      group. Baseline MRI and blood test will be performed before the start of their treatments and&#xD;
      two follow-up scans as well as blood tests in six-month and twelve-month intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study allows objective measurement to evaluate efficacy of different treatments against&#xD;
      obesity and the response of NAFLD after weight loss. Furthermore, this study provides&#xD;
      quantitative measurement of BAT and tests whether BAT is associated with NAFLD or other&#xD;
      metabolites disorders such as DM2 and hyperlipidemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b) Research plan and methodology Subjects Eighty volunteers will be recruited for this&#xD;
      project. 40 of them with mild-moderate obesity and the other 40 subjects with morbid obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morbid obesity subjects will be further divided into bariatric group (those who gave consent&#xD;
      for surgery i.e. 20 subjects and 20 for lifestyle intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mild- moderate obesity group will also be divided into two subgroups (20 in each group)&#xD;
      through a randomization process in a 1:1 ratio to participate in the dietitian led life style&#xD;
      modification program or receive usual care. The computer will be used to generate a list of&#xD;
      random numbers for randomization of the two groups and this will be done in blocks of six by&#xD;
      Nursing officers working in the clinic. The treatment assignments will be concealed in&#xD;
      numbered sealed envelopes which will only be opened sequentially upon patient enrollment.&#xD;
      Blinding methods to treatment assignments will be employed to both clinicians and&#xD;
      radiographers during analysis and patient assessments. Inclusion criteria involve individuals&#xD;
      between the age of 18-65, BMI ≥ 25-30 kg/m2 for mild-moderate obesity, BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 with&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome or BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 for morbid obesity, who have been diagnosed with NAFLD.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria include other kind of hepatic diseases or under medications that are known&#xD;
      to affect liver fat accumulation, weight≥250 kg, waist circumference≥150 cm. The maximum&#xD;
      weight and waist circumference are set due to the tolerance of the scanner and its bore size.&#xD;
      Written informed consents will be obtained from all volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol The protocol in this part of the study will be as described by Wong et al. At the&#xD;
      commencement of the study, all the 80 patients will initially be assessed by the dietitian&#xD;
      and relevant individual recommendations will be provided. This will include complete&#xD;
      behavioral change assessments, covering important areas such as the patient's current eating&#xD;
      habits, lifestyles patterns etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical group (bariatric surgery) The surgical group will be identified from the surgical&#xD;
      team and will be enrolled by the surgical team accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lifestyle Modification Group Patients randomized to the intervention group will participate&#xD;
      in a dietitian-led lifestyle modification programme for 12 months. The programme will be held&#xD;
      at 2 urban centres that are open to the public for the management of obesity and related&#xD;
      disorders. The programme will be based on a strategy of increasing energy expenditure and&#xD;
      reducing caloric intake using lifestyle behavioral change to achieve long-lasting impact. The&#xD;
      patients will attend dietary consultation sessions weekly in the first 4 months, and monthly&#xD;
      in the following 8 months. At the first session (about 1 h), the dietitian will carry out a&#xD;
      complete behavioral assessment, covering important areas such as the patient's current eating&#xD;
      and lifestyle patterns, specific eating-related behaviors, knowledge of risks associated with&#xD;
      current eating patterns, concerns and feelings about specific lifestyle changes. The&#xD;
      dietitian will also discuss the expected duration and specific dietary and lifestyle advices&#xD;
      to achieve a desirable weight status with the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the follow-up sessions (about 20 minutes), the dietitian will review the patient's dietary&#xD;
      practice and provide recommendations. Each patient will be given an individualized menu plan.&#xD;
      The dietary component and portion sizes of the menu plan will be based on the recommendations&#xD;
      of the American Dietetic Association . A varied balanced diet with an emphasis on fruit and&#xD;
      vegetables, and moderate-carbohydrate, low-fat, low-glycemic index (GI) and low calorific&#xD;
      products in appropriate portions will be encouraged. This diet will result in a relative&#xD;
      increase in energy consumption from proteins, which also will promote satiety. Each patient&#xD;
      will be provided with two booklets, one for food portion size exchange and tips for eating&#xD;
      out, and another listing the low-GI food options and meal plans (GI &lt;55). Furthermore,&#xD;
      techniques for coping at-risk situations such as parties and festival celebrations will be&#xD;
      taught. Recipes will also be provided to the patients to encourage healthy cooking. Adherence&#xD;
      to dietary intervention will be assessed by calculating the percentage attendance to the&#xD;
      intervention sessions and evaluating the dietary intakes and meal patterns using a weekly&#xD;
      food record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides, patients will be encouraged to see an exercise instructor at least once during the&#xD;
      lifestyle modification programme. During the first exercise consultation (about 30 min), the&#xD;
      exercise instructor will review the patient's medical history and exercise habits, and design&#xD;
      a suitable exercise regime for the patient. The patients will first be instructed to do&#xD;
      moderate intensity aerobic exercise for 30 min, 3 to 5 days a week and encouraged to increase&#xD;
      daily physical activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During subsequent appointments, the exercise instructor will evaluate the patient's exercise&#xD;
      progress on aerobic exercise and stretching during follow-ups. When the patients will be able&#xD;
      to develop a routine exercise habit, they will be instructed to perform resistance training&#xD;
      to increase their muscle endurance and strength for better aerobic performance and liver fat&#xD;
      reduction (30). The intensity of exercise will be gradually increased to 30 minutes every&#xD;
      day. The target will be a reduction of body mass index (BMI) towards 23 kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group Patients in the control group will receive routine care at the medical clinic&#xD;
      of the Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong. At baseline, a clinician will explain the&#xD;
      laboratory test results and the natural history of NAFLD to the patients. The patients will&#xD;
      be encouraged to reduce carbohydrate and fat intake, and to exercise for at least 3 times per&#xD;
      week, 30 minutes per session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up assessments in all groups The patients will attend the clinic at months 4 and 12&#xD;
      for metabolic assessment, and receive further advice from a clinician as appropriate. Before&#xD;
      each visit, patients will be asked to fast overnight for at least 8 hours, then blood samples&#xD;
      will be taken for liver biochemistry, glucose, insulin and lipids. Insulin resistance will be&#xD;
      estimated using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) calculated as fasting plasma&#xD;
      glucose (mmol/L) x insulin (mIU/L) / 22.5 and quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index&#xD;
      (QUICKI), calculated as 1/ [log fasting insulin (μU/mL) +log fasting glucose (mg/dL)]).&#xD;
      Alanine aminotransferase (IU/L), fasting glucose (mmol/L), hemoglobin A1c (%), total&#xD;
      cholesterol LDL, HDL(mmol/L) and triglycerides (mmol/L) will also be measured. Additionally,&#xD;
      Weight, height will be measured during their clinical visit before each of their MRI scan and&#xD;
      BMI will be calculated by weight (kg) / height^2 (m). Waist circumference will be measured at&#xD;
      a level midway between the lower rib margin and iliac crest with the tape all around the body&#xD;
      in the horizontal position. Physical activities will be recorded as the total duration of&#xD;
      active exercise (min) per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Image Acquisition Subjects from all the groups will undergo MRI at baseline before their&#xD;
      intervention and two follow-up scans at 4-months and 12-months intervals. All scanning will&#xD;
      be performed using a Philips Achieva 3.0 Tesla MRI Scanner (Philips Medical System, Best, The&#xD;
      Netherlands). Chemical-shift water-fat images will be acquired by the 3D spoiled multi-echo&#xD;
      modified DIXON sequence with a 16-channel SENSE-XL-Torso array also from Philips Healthcare.&#xD;
      Imaging parameters as follow: Repetition Time(TR) = 5.7-5.9 (ms), Echo time (TE)/echo spacing&#xD;
      = 1.2-1.4 (ms) / 1.0-1.2 (ms), number of echoes = 6, flip angle = 3°, SENSE acceleration = 2,&#xD;
      reconstructed slice thickness/number of slices = 3.0 mm / 50 to yield co-registered water,&#xD;
      fat, fat-fraction and T2* image series. Non-breath-hold acquisition will be performed from&#xD;
      the base of the skull to the base of the thoracic cavity for BAT measurement and breath-hold&#xD;
      acquisition will be performed from the dome of the diaphragm to the pubic symphysis for&#xD;
      abdominal SAT and VAT measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T1 liver images will be acquired using 3D T1-fast-field echo (FFE) sequence, 2-echoes:&#xD;
      TE1=1.8 msec, TE2=4.0 msec, TR=5.2 msec, flip angle=15, SENSE parallel imaging with&#xD;
      acceleration factor 2.0 in phase-encoding direction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vivo quantification of liver fat will be performed using single voxel STEAM spectroscopy&#xD;
      (TE=15 ms, TR=5000 ms, Number of signal avaregaes (NSA)=24, spectral width=2000 Hz, no water&#xD;
      suppression). A 30×30×30-mm^3 (27 mL) voxel will be located on the right liver lobe to avoid&#xD;
      major vessels according to the institutional protocol for hepatic fat measurement. Short TE&#xD;
      and long TR will be selected to minimize T2 and T1 effects. Non-breath hold scan will be&#xD;
      carried out and the acquisition time will be approximately 2 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative Measurement of Brown and Abdominal White Adipose Tissues Volume Brown adipose&#xD;
      tissue (BAT) will be extracted from MR images using an in-house algorithm that has been&#xD;
      validated and published in a recognized domain journal. This method utilizes the unique&#xD;
      features of fat-fraction and T2* values in BAT to segment the tissue. Volume of BAT will be&#xD;
      measured in mm^3 and be converted to mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abdominal white adipose tissue will be separated into subcutaneous and visceral adipose&#xD;
      tissues (SAT and VAT) using another in-house algorithm which has also been validated and&#xD;
      published in a domain journal. Volume will be measured in mililitre (ml) and region of&#xD;
      interest will be covered from the dome of diaphragm to the pubic symphysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spectrum Analysis for Intrahepatic Triglycerides (IHTG). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy&#xD;
      (MRS) data will be exported for offline time-domain analysis using the AMARES algorithm with&#xD;
      Gaussian line shapes fitting in jMRUI software package. IHTG will be measured for relative&#xD;
      fat signal integrals in terms of a percentage of the total signal amplitude. IHTG content is&#xD;
      calculated as [signal Intensity of fat/(Signal Intensity of fat+Signal Intensity of water)] x&#xD;
      100. The definition of NAFLD will be based on liver fat content higher than the threshold of&#xD;
      5.5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver Inflammation and Fibrosis Liver inflammation and fibrosis (LIF) scores based on&#xD;
      iron-corrected T1 (cT1) and T2* values will be calculated using LiverMultiScan™ (LMS,&#xD;
      Perspectum Diagnostics, Oxford, UK). LIF scores range from 0-4 which 0 indicates the least&#xD;
      severe and 4 as the most severe as show in figure 3. To validate the LIF scores, liver biopsy&#xD;
      will be performed during the bariatric surgeries for assessment of degree of inflammation and&#xD;
      fibrosis within the liver in association with NAFLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Within groups comparison will be measured using repeated measures ANOVA&#xD;
      for results acquired from 3 different time points (baseline, Month 4 and Month 12). Variables&#xD;
      with significant differences will be carried forward for pairwise comparison with bonferroni&#xD;
      correction. Between groups comparison (life-style intervention and bariatric groups) will be&#xD;
      measured in relative changes between baseline to Month 4 and Month 4 to Month12. Statistical&#xD;
      analyses will be conducted using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 25 (IBM,&#xD;
      New York , USA). Significant level is selected at p &lt; 0.05 (2-tailed).&#xD;
