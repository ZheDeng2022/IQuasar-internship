    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled clinical trial to compare the pregnancy outcomes of&#xD;
      mild and minimal stimulation in infertile women with polycystic ovarian syndrome. The study&#xD;
      population consisted of all infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome based on Rotterdam&#xD;
      criteria who have not succeed to achieve fertility despite multiple treatments such as drug&#xD;
      therapy, laparoscopic surgery, and the frequent failure of induction therapy using&#xD;
      gonadotropins and are now candidate for in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intra cytoplasmic&#xD;
      sperm injection (ICSI) in Reproductive Biomedicine Research Center, Royan institute, Tehran&#xD;
      Iran.&#xD;

      An overview of the history of assisted reproductive technologies such as IVF and ICSI that&#xD;
      are based on the process of ovulation stimulation, suggests that although this process was&#xD;
      initially welcomed with the aim of achieving a large number of oocytes and embryos,&#xD;
      consequences such as low quality of obtained oocytes and embryos, failure in achieving the&#xD;
      desired results in fertility of treated patients, and the incidence of adverse effects such&#xD;
      as ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome have made researchers re-examine the process of&#xD;
      ovulation stimulation. Hence, mild ovulation stimulation method has been introduced to the&#xD;
      field of assisted reproductive techniques (ART) in recent years. This method includes the&#xD;
      prescription of low doses of gonadotropins or shorter duration of its administration in the&#xD;
      ovulation stimulation cycle. Mild ovulation method has advantages such as reduction of the&#xD;
      physical, mental, and financial risks of treatment which can improve the quality assisted&#xD;
      reproductive services provided for infertile couples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have confirmed the efficiency of this method of ovulation stimulation as a&#xD;
      way for improving the quality of the ovulation process and achieving desirable results in&#xD;
      fertility. However, the important and interesting point in studies conducted in this area,&#xD;
      particularly on IVF and ICSI cycles, is that the application of this method has been mostly&#xD;
      investigated in normal populations and, after the approval of its efficiency, it has been&#xD;
      recommended to be used in patients with poor or high ovarian response. It should be also&#xD;
      mentioned that efficiency of this method in patients with poor ovarian response has been&#xD;
      evaluated in a few studies, while in patients with high ovarian response such as those&#xD;
      suffering from polycystic ovary syndrome, only few studies have been conducted in patients&#xD;
      with a history of ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome. On the other hand, in many cases, the&#xD;
      efficiency of mild ovulation stimulation, in which lower doses or shorter durations of&#xD;
      gonadotropin administration are desired, has been investigated, and the application of&#xD;
      minimal ovulation stimulation method, in which the use of clomiphene citrate is also included&#xD;
      besides lower doses or shorter durations of gonadotropin administration, has been studied in&#xD;
      a few cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the dose and duration of gonadotropin administration, another important point&#xD;
      in achieving the desired results of treatment using the ovulation stimulation cycles is the&#xD;
      type of gonadotropin. The studies conducted on the comparison of recombinant-FSH (rec-FSH)&#xD;
      and Human Menopausal Gonadotropin (HMG) types of gonadotropin indicate the superiority of HMG&#xD;
      gonadotropins, as the results show that the administration of HMG gonadotropins will lead to&#xD;
      achieving fewer but high quality oocytes and embryos. By contrast, rec-FSH application puts&#xD;
      the patients at increased risk of ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome. However, the&#xD;
      interesting and important point in most of these studies is that this comparison has been&#xD;
      drawn in long-term treatment cycles, while few studies have been conducted on antagonist&#xD;
      treatment cycles which do not fully corroborate the results obtained from long-term cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to what mentioned above, the present research aims to study the efficiency of&#xD;
      minimal ovulation stimulation method in the treatment of infertile patients with poly cystic&#xD;
      ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and also the effect of gonadotropin type on treatment cycles with&#xD;
      antagonist gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). It is hoped that the findings of the&#xD;
      present research provide solutions for improving the quality of infertility treatment in PCOS&#xD;
      patients, who currently undergo IVF or ICSI as a last resort.&#xD;
