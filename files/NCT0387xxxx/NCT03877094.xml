    <textblock>
      Randomized clinical trial about the evaluation of the impact of the virtual reality&#xD;
      intervention on the experience of pain, physical and psychological discomfort, well-being and&#xD;
      anxiety of women during breast biopsy use of nature virtual reality video.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast biopsy is one of the main tests for the diagnosis of cancer, which generates emotional&#xD;
      distress and can be a painful procedure. Distraction has considerable efficacy among mild&#xD;
      psychological methods for reducing pain perception. Virtual Reality is the most advanced&#xD;
      technology of distraction, with the highest level of immersion in virtual worlds and&#xD;
      effective results as a non-pharmacological measure in pain perception. However, audiovisual&#xD;
      resources related to nature have not yet been investigated in this clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial aims to verify the impact of the virtual reality intervention on the&#xD;
      experience of pain, physical and psychological discomfort, well-being and anxiety of women&#xD;
      during breast biopsy; its influence on the time of the examination; the degree of&#xD;
      recommendation of the intervention; and if the connection with nature interferes in the&#xD;
      results obtained on the studied variables. The Immersive Reality intervention will be&#xD;
      provided during the breast biopsy and the variables will be evaluated using Likert-type&#xD;
      scales and pain using the Analog Virtual Scale. Our study hypothesis is that this&#xD;
      intervention reduce the perception of pain / discomfort during the biopsy by connecting with&#xD;
      nature, reducing anxiety, exam time, and increasing the sense of well-being.&#xD;

    <description>The Nature Connection Scale is used to verify the affective aspect of the person-environment relationship. It is composed of 14 items, which are answered in a scale of 5 points, ranging from 1 (I totally disagree) to 5 (I totally agree). The higher the score, the greater the individual's connection with nature.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of Discomfort and well-being</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the end of the biopsy procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire contains 6 questions that must be answered using the Likert Scale (from 1 to 5).&#xD;
question: your perception of physical discomfort during the exam. 1 means lot of physical discomfort and 5 a lot of physical comfort.&#xD;
question: what was your perception of psychological discomfort during the exam. 1 means lot of psychological discomfort and 5 a lot of psychological comfort.&#xD;
question: how would you rate your sense of well-being during the examination.1 means total absence of well-being and 5 best well-being welfare.&#xD;
question: how much anxiety you were in relation to the exam. 1 means extremely anxious and 5 nothing anxious.&#xD;
question: how much anxiety you are in relation to the test result. 1 means extremely anxious and 5 nothing anxious.&#xD;
question: Would you recommend this virtual reality intervention during exams that could generate some kind of discomfort? 1 means would definitely recommend and 5 would definitely not recommend</description>
