  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well bendamustine, obinutuzumab, and venetoclax work in&#xD;
      treating patients with mantle cell lymphoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as bendamustine&#xD;
      and venetoclax, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing&#xD;
      the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy&#xD;
      with monoclonal antibodies, such as obinutuzumab, may help the body's immune system attack&#xD;
      the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving&#xD;
      bendamustine, obinutuzumab, and venetoclax may work better in treating patients with mantle&#xD;
      cell lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the efficacy of the combination of bendamustine, obinutuzumab and venetoclax&#xD;
      in patients with untreated mantle cell lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and dose intensity of the combination of bendamustine, obinutuzumab&#xD;
      and venetoclax in untreated mantle cell lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore methods of determining molecular remission for patients with untreated mantle&#xD;
      cell lymphoma (MCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate long-term outcomes including progression-free and overall survival for&#xD;
      patients with untreated MCL who receive the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive venetoclax orally (PO) on days 1-28 of course 1 and days 1-10 of subsequent&#xD;
      courses, bendamustine intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 2, and obinutuzumab IV on days 1, 8,&#xD;
      and 15 of course 1 and day 1 of subsequent courses. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to&#xD;
      6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 45-60 days.&#xD;

             venetoclax or 18 months after the last dose of obinutuzumab, whichever is longer&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal,&#xD;
                  has not reached a postmenopausal state (≥ 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year include&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the&#xD;
                  duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  With female partners of childbearing potential, men must remain abstinent or use&#xD;
                  a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a&#xD;
                  failure rate of &lt; 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 6&#xD;
                  months after the last dose of obinutuzumab. Men must refrain from donating sperm&#xD;
                  during this same period&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  With pregnant female partners, men must remain abstinent or use a condom during&#xD;
                  the treatment period and for at least 6 months after the last dose of&#xD;
                  obinutuzumab to avoid exposing the embryo&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the&#xD;
                  duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
                  patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or&#xD;
                  postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception&#xD;
