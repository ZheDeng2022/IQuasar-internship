      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose Escalation: To determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose&#xD;
           (MAD) and overall safety and tolerability profile of SAR441000 when administered&#xD;
           intratumorally as monotherapy and in combination with cemiplimab in patients who have no&#xD;
           alternative standard treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose Expansion (Combination): To determine the objective response rate of SAR441000&#xD;
           administered intratumorally in combination with cemiplimab in patients with melanoma,&#xD;
           cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of SAR441000 administered as&#xD;
           monotherapy and in combination with cemiplimab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the immunogenicity of SAR441000.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the safety of SAR441000 when administered intratumorally in combination&#xD;
           with cemiplimab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DoR) and progression&#xD;
           free survival (PFS) of SAR441000.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the recommended dose of SAR441000 for the expansion phase.&#xD;

      The expected duration of treatment for patients who benefit from study intervention may vary,&#xD;
      based on progression date. Median expected duration of study per patient is estimated as 9&#xD;
      months in monotherapy and 12 months in combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum treatment duration for non-progressive patients is up to 2 years.&#xD;
