  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective observational study of a single cohort of the patients who will&#xD;
      undergo a scheduled living donor liver transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators attempt to evaluate the association of intraoperative renal regional oxygen&#xD;
      saturation and acute kidney injury in patients undergoing living donor liver transplantation.&#xD;
      Near-infrared spectroscopy sensor will be attached to the skin near bilateral kidney areas in&#xD;
      all patients and renal regional oxygen saturation will be monitored during the operation.&#xD;
      Renal regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) of the patients who developed acute kidney injury&#xD;
      postoperatively will be compared with rSO2 of the patients who did not.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury is a frequent complication after liver transplantation, which is related&#xD;
      to poor prognosis and longer hospital stay. There is no sensitive or specific marker for&#xD;
      predicting postoperative acute kidney injury, although studies of the biomarkers have shown&#xD;
      promising results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Near-infrared spectroscopy is a non-invasive and real-time monitoring device for regional&#xD;
      oxygen saturation measurement. Previous studies revealed that it could be applied to the skin&#xD;
      near the kidney and be used to monitor renal regional oxygen saturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in this study, the investigators will apply near-infrared spectroscopy around&#xD;
      kidney area to measure real-time renal regional oxygen saturation during liver&#xD;
      transplantation surgery and investigate the association between the intraoperative renal&#xD;
      regional oxygen saturation and the development of post-transplant acute kidney injury.&#xD;
