  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Beta-thalassemias are hereditary blood disorders caused by reduced or absent synthesis of&#xD;
      hemoglobin beta chains, with variable outcomes ranging from severe anemia to clinically&#xD;
      asymptomatic individuals. Treatment is symptomatic and thalassemia is a major unmet medical&#xD;
      need. Survival is increased, even in patients needing transfusions, in comparison with a few&#xD;
      years ago, but the quality of life is poor for many patients. In some patients, an anomalous&#xD;
      expression of gamma-globin genes has been observed, with a consequent rise in Fetal&#xD;
      Hemoglobin levels. The patients displaying a clinical phenotype known as Hereditary&#xD;
      Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin (HPFH) exhibit a positive clinical status. To mimick HPFH,&#xD;
      several compounds able to induce expression of fetal hemoglobins (HbF) have been evaluated.&#xD;
      Within this framework, sirolimus is particularly interesting as an inducer of HbF. It has&#xD;
      been used for many years for different indications and the available preclinical evidence&#xD;
      warrant the start of a clinical development plan in thalassemia. The investigators propose a&#xD;
      clinical trial in beta-thalassemia patients, designed to evaluate the effect of sirolimus on&#xD;
      several parameters related to red blood cell status and to the level of HbF in particular, as&#xD;
      a first step for the full clinical development in this new indication.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The general aim of the protocol is to demonstrate the applicability of a personalised and&#xD;
      precision medicine approach in beta-thalassemia in a clinical trial setting for a repurposed&#xD;
      drug, namely sirolimus. The presence of high level of Fetal Hemoglobin (HbF) is considered a&#xD;
      condition predictive of a favourable outcome in thalassemia and its increase induced by&#xD;
      pharmacological agents is considered a potential way to improve clinical status of the&#xD;
      patients. In the present trial, in terms of efficacy analysis, the investigators will focus&#xD;
      their attention on HbF levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To evaluate the suitability of sirolimus for the treatment of beta-thalassemia patients&#xD;
      within the frame of a comprehensive project aimed to the reduction of their transfusions need&#xD;
      (consequently ameliorating their quality of life). This goal can be obtained through a&#xD;
      pharmacologically mediated increased level of HbF, with a prerequisite to be verified, namely&#xD;
      the correlation between induction of HbF in vitro and in vivo in single patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess safety of sirolimus and correlation between administered dose and blood levels&#xD;
           in beta-thalassemia patients,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the influence of sirolimus on transfusion regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effect of sirolimus on hematopoietic and immune system of thalassemia&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;

    <description>Evaluation of the patient quality of life at 6 and 12 months compared to baseline through Transfusion-dependent Quality of Life questionnaire (TranQol), measuring specifically the quality of life in patients with thalassemia. The TranQol is a disease-specific Quality of Life measure that has been shown to be valid and reliable (Klaassen et al, British Journal of Haematology, 2014, 164, 431-437). On a total scale of 0-100, higher values always represent a better outcome. The questions are grouped into four domains: physical health, emotional health, family functioning, and school and career functioning. The adult self-report questionnaires include a fifth category on sexual activity which is only one item. Subscales are summed.</description>
