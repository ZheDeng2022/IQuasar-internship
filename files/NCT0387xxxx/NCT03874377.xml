  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to conduct a single arm open trial to examine the feasibility of a&#xD;
      brief, adjunctive mindfulness intervention tailored to the needs of adolescents with severe&#xD;
      obesity.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether it is feasible to integrate a brief,&#xD;
      adjunctive mindfulness intervention with the standard medical management of obesity in&#xD;
      adolescents with severe obesity. Mindfulness refers to the experience of paying attention to&#xD;
      the present moment in a nonjudgmental manner. Mindfulness training enhances one's ability to&#xD;
      cope with negative emotions and one's awareness of decision-making processes and internal&#xD;
      experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study has two specific aims: 1) to conduct a single arm open trial to examine&#xD;
      the feasibility and acceptability of the mindfulness intervention in a sample of 15&#xD;
      adolescents with severe obesity; and 2) to examine the preliminary efficacy of the&#xD;
      mindfulness intervention on BMI, emotion regulation, eating and weight-related behaviors,&#xD;
      impulsivity, waist circumference, and blood pressure in comparison to the standard of care.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant Satisfaction: Satisfaction Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks post study start date</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess participants' satisfaction with the intervention by having them complete a satisfaction survey at the end of the program to assess perceived helpfulness of the intervention and to elicit feedback on the various components. Participants respond to 6 questions (e.g., &quot;I enjoyed being a part of this program&quot;) on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). An average across scores will be calculated with higher scores reflecting greater satisfaction. Possible scores range from 1 to 5.</description>

    <measure>Binge Eating - Eating Disorders Examination-Questionnaire (EDEQ).</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will report instances of binge eating via items of the Eating Disorders Examination-Questionnaire (EDEQ). Participants report how often they engaged in binge eating over the past 28 days 0 (no days) to 28 (every day). Higher scores represent greater eating pathology.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mindful Attention Awareness Scale-Adolescent (MAAS-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants rate how frequently they experience episodes of mindless behavior via the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale-Adolescent (MAAS-A). The MAAS-A is a 15-item measure of dispositional mindfulness. Participants respond to statements on a scale from 1 (almost always) to 6 (almost never). Items are summed with scores ranging from 15 to 90, with higher scores representing higher levels of mindfulness.</description>

    <measure>&quot;Go&quot; Reaction Time - Measure of Inhibitory Control</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Go No Go Task examines inhibitory control via a computerized program. Participants are instructed to press a button when a certain image is shown on the screen (e.g., a green rectangle, a cross). They are instructed not to respond when another image is shown on the screen (e.g., a blue rectangle, an X). Poor inhibitory control is evident by more failures to inhibit responses in the &quot;no go&quot; condition. Reaction time is the processing speed for correct Go trials.</description>

    <measure>Overeating - Eating Disorders Examination-Questionnaire (EDEQ).</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants report instances of overeating via items of the Eating Disorders Examination-Questionnaire (EDEQ). Participants report how often they engaged in overeating over the past 28 days 0 (no days) to 28 (every day). Higher scores represent greater overeating.</description>

    <measure>Go No Go False Alarm Rate - Measure of Inhibitory Control</measure>

    <description>The Go No Go Task examines inhibitory control via a computerized program. Participants are instructed to press a button when a certain image is shown on the screen (e.g., a green rectangle, a cross). They are instructed not to respond when another image is shown on the screen (e.g., a blue rectangle, an X). Poor inhibitory control is evident by more failures to inhibit responses in the &quot;no go&quot; condition. The false alarm rate refers to incorrect No Go trials.</description>

    <description>The mindfulness intervention consists of 6 weekly sessions, blending material from the evidence-based Learning to BREATHE and Mindfulness-Based Eating Awareness Training manualized interventions. Sessions will focus on: experiential mindfulness exercises, such as mindful eating, loving kindness practices, breath awareness, and mindful movement; hunger and satiety awareness; improving responses to emotions; practicing acceptance and being non-judgmental; and tolerating negative feelings and sensations, including those related to hunger and cravings. Participants will be assigned brief homework exercises (approximately 10 minutes) daily in between appointments.Participants in this arm will also receive the usual care provided by the weight management clinic.</description>

        <title>Participant Satisfaction: Satisfaction Survey</title>
        <description>We will assess participants' satisfaction with the intervention by having them complete a satisfaction survey at the end of the program to assess perceived helpfulness of the intervention and to elicit feedback on the various components. Participants respond to 6 questions (e.g., &quot;I enjoyed being a part of this program&quot;) on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). An average across scores will be calculated with higher scores reflecting greater satisfaction. Possible scores range from 1 to 5.</description>

            <description>The mindfulness intervention consists of 6 weekly sessions, blending material from the evidence-based Learning to BREATHE and Mindfulness-Based Eating Awareness Training manualized interventions. Sessions will focus on: experiential mindfulness exercises, such as mindful eating, loving kindness practices, breath awareness, and mindful movement; hunger and satiety awareness; improving responses to emotions; practicing acceptance and being non-judgmental; and tolerating negative feelings and sensations, including those related to hunger and cravings. Participants will be assigned brief homework exercises (approximately 10 minutes) daily in between appointments.Participants in this arm will also receive the usual care provided by the weight management clinic.</description>

Participants are instructed to press a button when a certain image is shown on the screen (e.g., a green rectangle, a cross). They are instructed not to respond when another image is shown on the screen (e.g., a blue rectangle, an X). Poor inhibitory control is evident by more failures to inhibit responses in the &quot;no go&quot; condition. Reaction time is the processing speed for correct Go trials.</description>
