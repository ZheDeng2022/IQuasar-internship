    <textblock>
      Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a leading cause of childhood illness and hospitalization&#xD;
      across the world. In addition to acute mortality and morbidity, RSV infection is associated&#xD;
      with developing recurrent wheeze in pre-school children and asthma in later life. The&#xD;
      overarching aim of the study is to demonstrate the long-term effect of RSV infection on child&#xD;
      health in resource-poor settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children previously infected with RSV in their first two months of life and age-matched&#xD;
      controls will be followed and epidemiological data will be compared in terms of prevalence of&#xD;
      asthma, lung function status, physical growth status, and asthma risk factors. Enrolled&#xD;
      children will be routinely assessed for a period of 12 months. During this period, this study&#xD;
      will record the health status of the children (respiratory tract illness, wheeze, cough,&#xD;
      other illness, and attendance at medical services), physical growth (height, weight and&#xD;
      mid-upper arm circumference), family history of atopic diseases (e.g. asthma) and&#xD;
      environmental risk exposure (indoor tobacco smoke, crowding, and cooking fuels, cooking&#xD;
      place) among enrolled children. Where the acute asthma exacerbation will be suspected,&#xD;
      physicians will assess the lung condition of the enrolled sick children using stethoscope and&#xD;
      peak flow-meter. The lung function of children will be measured using spirometry,&#xD;
      hyper-reactivity against common allergens will be performed using skin prick methods,&#xD;
      exercise challenge test will be performed to understand the airway hyperresponsiveness, and&#xD;
      blood eosinophil count determine the eosinophil level in the peripheral blood.&#xD;

      Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of childhood illness&#xD;
      which attack the lower respiratory tract and develop bronchitis and pneumonia. Approximately&#xD;
      70% of infants are infected with RSV during their first year of life, and almost all children&#xD;
      are infected at least once by 2 years of age (Wu &amp; Hartert, 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each year, an estimated 33·1 million episodes of RSV-associated acute lower respiratory&#xD;
      infections occur among under-five children globally, leading to 3·2 million hospitalizations&#xD;
      and 118,200 deaths (Ting Shi &amp; Acacio, 2017). The burden of RSV-associated severe acute lower&#xD;
      respiratory tract infection is 10 times higher in developing countries compared to that in&#xD;
      developed countries (36.1 per 1000 life birth vs 3.2 per 1000 life birth, respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to acute mortality and morbidity, RSV infection has a long-term effect on&#xD;
      children's health (Jat &amp; Kabra, 2017; Kneyber, Steyerberg, de Groot, &amp; Moll, 2000). RSV&#xD;
      infection can induce a state of bronchial hyper-reactivity that has an association with the&#xD;
      development of asthma in later life (Balfour-Lynn, 1996), which, in turn, is a major risk&#xD;
      factor of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adulthood (Svanes et al., 2010).. The&#xD;
      prevalence of wheezing and asthma were reported two times higher in the children who had RSV&#xD;
      bronchitis in infancy compared with children without a history of bronchiolitis during&#xD;
      infancy (Sigurs et al., 2010). In a report, it was shown that among the children who&#xD;
      experienced asthma by school age, 31% of them had healthcare visits in infancy due to&#xD;
      respiratory diseases (Wu &amp; Hartert, 2011). The severity of the RSV associated illness was&#xD;
      reported as an additive factor for asthma risk. Hartert et, al., reported that asthma&#xD;
      prevalence was two times higher in the infants who were hospitalized for RSV infection&#xD;
      compared to the other who received care at the outdoor department (Wu &amp; Hartert, 2011). In&#xD;
      the mouse model, it was found that viral infection in neonatal rats delayed the growth of&#xD;
      secondary septa, decreased the alveolar surface density by 14 to 26%, and reduced the&#xD;
      diameter of terminal bronchioles by 11 and 20% (Castleman, Sorkness, Lemanske, Grasee, &amp;&#xD;
      Suyemoto, 1988). However, there is no data on the effect of RSV infection on the lung of&#xD;
      neonates. In human, the lung remains premature at birth and continue to develop for 2-3 years&#xD;
      postnatally and can be assumed that the impact of RSV infection during early infancy would be&#xD;
      very severe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collecting clinical samples from young infants and lack of appropriate diagnostic to detect&#xD;
      RSV virus are the major obstacles to study RSV infection in developing countries. No study&#xD;
      from developing countries has investigated the long-term effect of RSV infections incurred&#xD;
      during the young infant period. It is assumed that the long-term effect of RSV infection&#xD;
      might be more intense if infection occurs during this period, as the lungs of newborns&#xD;
      continue to develop for the first several months of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a study aimed to determine the etiology of young infant infection at five centers&#xD;
      of three South Asian countries (Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan). This study identified 474&#xD;
      young infants who had laboratory-confirmed RSV infection; additionally, this study tested&#xD;
      specimens from 1,873 age and sex-matched healthy infants, which were found to be negative for&#xD;
      RSV. The current age of that cohort is between 5 and 7 years, which provides a unique&#xD;
      opportunity to gather information on the long-term effect of RSV infection in a large number&#xD;
      of laboratory-confirmed cases at a low cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the relative frequency and impact of RSV infection in developing healthcare settings,&#xD;
      should the investigators identify a high prevalence of subsequent wheeze and asthma the&#xD;
      potential benefit of interventions to reduce RSV will be enhanced. In addition, this study&#xD;
      will have the following supplementary benefits (1) the ability to report the feasibility to&#xD;
      identify wheeze frequency by self-reporting in South Asian populations, (2) the feasibility&#xD;
      and outcomes of tests that are utilized to support the diagnosis of asthma and other&#xD;
      respiratory diseases in children, i.e. skin prick tests, Eosinophil count and spirometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Questions: The overarching aim of this study is to understand the long-term effect&#xD;
      on child health of RSV infection occurring in the first two months of life. Therefore,&#xD;
      through this study, the investigators aim to investigate the following research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is there an association between RSV infection in the first two months of life and&#xD;
           development of asthma later in childhood?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is the lung function of children who had RSV infection in the first 2 months of life&#xD;
           lower than that of children who did not have RSV infection?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Is there an association between RSV infection in the first two months of life and&#xD;
           physical development in childhood?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Are risk factors for childhood asthma different for the children who had RSV infection&#xD;
           in the first two months of life than others without RSV infection at the same age?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodologies: The investigators have identified sites of the Aetiology of Neonatal Sepsis in&#xD;
      South Asia (ANISA) study, two in Pakistan and one each in Bangladesh and India to implement&#xD;
      this study. Health workers will visit the households of eligible children. Children whose&#xD;
      parents provide consent will be visited three times in one year period, at baseline, after&#xD;
      six months and the end of the year. In the first visit, a member of the research team will&#xD;
      explain the study objectives and procedures to one of the family members (primarily the&#xD;
      mother) of the eligible children to provide consent for enrolling the children in the study,&#xD;
      the parents of the enrolled children will be interviewed using a structured questionnaire to&#xD;
      record the current and previous health status of children. Study team members will remain&#xD;
      blind about the RSV infectious status of the children to avoid enrollment bias. To ascertain&#xD;
      asthma and wheeze, parents will be inquired about breathing difficulties of the children&#xD;
      using a questionnaire designed by the International Study of Allergies and Asthma in&#xD;
      Childhood (ISAAC), dermatitis will be defined by the criteria provided by The U.K. Working&#xD;
      Party's Diagnostic Criteria for Atopic Dermatitis. It was previously reported that terms such&#xD;
      as ''wheeze'' and ''difficulty in breathing'' used in the ISAAC questionnaire have little&#xD;
      validity when comparing clinical cases between parents and also between clinicians, and the&#xD;
      conceptual understandings of ''wheeze'' for parents of children with reported wheeze are&#xD;
      different from definitions used in epidemiology (Bisgaard &amp; Szefler, 2007). To reduce the&#xD;
      differences in patient responses, the research team will provide a video demonstration of&#xD;
      wheeze and asthma-like symptoms to the parents before introducing the questionnaire. They&#xD;
      will also introduce a child &quot;case card&quot; to the parents and request to record the wheezing&#xD;
      episodes of their enrolled children using this case card. Additionally, they will also&#xD;
      request the parents to reach team (over the phone) if they notice wheezing sound to their&#xD;
      children, a research team will visit the symptomatic children and perform a physical&#xD;
      assessment of the child using auscultation and peak flowmetry. The research team will return&#xD;
      to the families after six months to emphasize the use of the case card for recording wheeze&#xD;
      episodes and also refer the children to the health facilities for physical assessment&#xD;
      (spirometry, exercise challenge test, skin prick test, and eosinophil count test and&#xD;
      anthropometric measurements). In the health facilities, physicians will perform afore mention&#xD;
      tests and procedures. The research team will return to the families again after one year of&#xD;
      the first visit and collect the &quot;case card&quot; from where they will record the number of&#xD;
      wheeze/asthma episode occurred in the last one year (follow-up period).&#xD;

        Between 2011 and 2015, ANISA study team members enrolled 56,987 newborns in four study&#xD;
        sites. All the suspected sick infants were referred to the health facilities where study&#xD;
        physicians assessed the infants using the criteria of possible serious bacterial. Infants&#xD;
        who were identified as sick were advised to provide respiratory samples (oropharyngeal and&#xD;
        nasopharyngeal swabs). Total 6,394 respiratory samples were collected from 5,350 ill&#xD;
        infants, 433 infants were positive for RSV. Additionally, ANISA study team collected&#xD;
        respiratory specimens from 1587 age and sex-matched healthy children who did not have any&#xD;
        clinical sign of illness at the time of specimens collected and were also remain apparently&#xD;
