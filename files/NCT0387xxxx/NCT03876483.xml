  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In contrast all other age groups, adolescents (age 10-19 years) have experienced constant,&#xD;
      rather than declining, HIV-related mortality in the last decade. This is due in part to poor&#xD;
      retention in care and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in this age group. As youth&#xD;
      living with HIV enter adulthood, they transition from pediatric to adult HIV care. The&#xD;
      transition to adult care presents heightened challenges to retention, due to disruption of&#xD;
      established relationships with pediatric healthcare providers and a shift to an adult care&#xD;
      model that requires greater autonomy and offers less specialized support. Resources to&#xD;
      support youth through the transition are lacking. Mobile technology for health promotion&#xD;
      (mHealth) using social media is a promising approach to maintain engagement in care through&#xD;
      the transition. mHealth reminders, education, and support from healthcare workers have been&#xD;
      successful in improving ART adherence in the adult HIV care setting and there have been&#xD;
      limited, though promising, results in youth care. This study will support the development of&#xD;
      a novel mHealth strategy for the Pediatric to Adult HIV Care Transition (mPACT). The&#xD;
      conceptual framework for this intervention is based on providing support to youth who are&#xD;
      transitioning to adult care through a combination of virtual group peer support and 1-to-1&#xD;
      communication with a healthcare worker trained in youth HIV care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are to (1) identify the specific barriers to successful youth&#xD;
      transition to adult HIV care, develop the mPACT intervention messaging strategy, and create a&#xD;
      prototype of the mHealth platform; (2) Pilot the mPACT intervention to determine its effect&#xD;
      on the intermediate outcomes of transition preparedness, ART knowledge, stigma, depression,&#xD;
      social and caregiver support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using an iterative mixed methods approach we will develop and pilot the mPACT intervention to&#xD;
      improve transition to adult HIV care. Aim 1 focuses on identifying barriers, assessing user&#xD;
      requirements, developing and refining communication content and strategies, and adapting&#xD;
      existing technology platforms through in-depth individual interviews and focus group&#xD;
      discussions and with youth living with HIV, healthcare works, caregivers, and policy makers.&#xD;
      Aim 2 will pilot the intervention tool using a cluster randomized trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      impact of the intervention on intermediate factors relevant to transition to adult HIV care.&#xD;

      AIM 1a: Youth IDIs and caregiver and HCW/peer counselor FGDs Participants in in-depth&#xD;
      individual interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs) will be recruited from the&#xD;
      study clinics. IDIs and FGDs will be performed in a private room at the clinic from which the&#xD;
      participant was recruited. IDIs and FGDs will be conducted by a trained qualitative&#xD;
      interviewer fluent in English and Kiswahili. Before the IDI or FGD begins, socio-demographic&#xD;
      information will be collected in standardized questionnaires using a tablet-based system&#xD;
      (Open Data Kit, ODK). For youth, sociodemographic data to be collected include age, HIV&#xD;
      treatment history, HIV status disclosure, family socio-economic status, education level, and&#xD;
      technology access. For caregivers, data to be collected include age, relationship to the&#xD;
      youth patient, and involvement in youth's HIV care. For HCW/peer counselors, data include&#xD;
      age, professional role, time in practice and technology access. The interviewer will then&#xD;
      describe procedures and norms for the IDI/FGD and participants will be given a chance to ask&#xD;
      questions. Participants will be reminded that their participation is voluntary and they may&#xD;
      refuse to answer any question or end the interview/FGD at any time. Participants will receive&#xD;
      unique identification numbers and will not be addressed by their names to maintain&#xD;
      confidentiality. The interviewer will then ask questions and facilitate a discussion based on&#xD;
      a discussion guide. Aim 1a IDIs will last approximately 1 hour and Aim 1a FGDs will last 1.5&#xD;
      - 2 hours. The IDI/FGD will be audio recorded and the facilitator will take written notes.&#xD;
      Discussions will be conducted in English or Kiswahili, depending on participant preferences.&#xD;
      Notes will be compared to audio-recordings to fill in missing information, transcribed and&#xD;
      translated to English (if necessary). Transcribed data will be de-identified. Audio-recorded&#xD;
      interviews will be destroyed after the transcripts have been validated. Participants will be&#xD;
      provided refreshments and KSh 400 to compensate for their time and transportation expenses to&#xD;
      participate in the study. We will provide this monetary compensation to each participant at&#xD;
      the conclusion of each IDI/FGD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1a: Policy-maker IDIs Policy-makers will be approached and recruited to participate. IDIs&#xD;
      will be performed in a private room at the policy-maker's place of work or at the study&#xD;
      clinic, depending on the participant's preference. IDIs will be conducted by a trained&#xD;
      qualitative interviewer fluent in English and Kiswahili. Before the IDI begins,&#xD;
      socio-demographic information will be collected in standardized questionnaires using a&#xD;
      tablet-based system (Open Data Kit, ODK). Data to be collected include age, professional&#xD;
      role, and involvement with policy-making and implementation related to youth HIV care. The&#xD;
      interviewer will then describe procedures and norms for the IDI and participants will be&#xD;
      given a chance to ask questions. Participants will be reminded that their participation is&#xD;
      voluntary and they may refuse to answer any question or end the interview/FGD at any time.&#xD;
      Participants will receive unique identification numbers and will not be addressed by their&#xD;
      name to maintain confidentiality. The interviewer will then ask questions and facilitate a&#xD;
      discussion based on a discussion guide. Policy-maker IDIs will last approximately 1 hour. The&#xD;
      IDI will be audio recorded and the facilitator will take written notes. Discussions will be&#xD;
      conducted in English or Kiswahili, depending on participant preferences. Notes will be&#xD;
      compared to audio-recordings to fill in missing information, transcribed and translated to&#xD;
      English (if necessary). Transcribed data will be de-identified. Audio-recorded interviews&#xD;
      will be destroyed after the transcripts have been validated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1b: User-centered design FGDs with youth and HCW/peer counselors Based on input from&#xD;
      interviews and FGDs conducted in Aim 1a, we will develop a prototype mHealth intervention&#xD;
      that will use WhatsApp to provide peer support groups and 1-to-1 text messaging between youth&#xD;
      and HCWs. The prototype will include messaging content, facilitation guides, and an interface&#xD;
      to manage communication that will be used by facilitators and HSWs. To evaluate the&#xD;
      acceptability of the prototype and to get feedback on how it can be improved, we will conduct&#xD;
      2 rounds of user-centered designed FGDs with youth and HCW.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will evaluate the prototype intervention using user-centered design FGDs with youth living&#xD;
      with HIV who are in the process of transitioning to adult care or have completed the&#xD;
      transition and with HCWs/peer counselors who care for youth living with HIV. Participants for&#xD;
      each set of FGDs will be recruited as described above. Following informed consent,&#xD;
      participants will complete an enrollment visit in which questionnaire data will be collected&#xD;
      using tablet-based ODK forms. For youth, data to be collected include sociodemographic&#xD;
      characteristics such as age, family socioeconomic status, education level, technology access,&#xD;
      HIV treatment history, social support, depression, stigma, ART knowledge and motivation, ART&#xD;
      adherence. For HCWs/peer counselors, data include age, professional role, time in practice&#xD;
      and technology access. FGDs will be conducted in 2 rounds. In the first round, FGDs with&#xD;
      youth will explore their comprehension, interest and reactions to prototypical messages and&#xD;
      discussion topics. FGDs with HCW will explore their reactions and comfort with prototypical&#xD;
      messages and discussion topics. HCW will also be presented with the prototype message&#xD;
      management interface, training materials, and their input sought on improvements. The second&#xD;
      round of FGDs will recruit a new group of participants to evaluate the modified content and&#xD;
      interface. Participants will be provided refreshments and KSh 400 (approximately $4) to&#xD;
      compensate for their time and transportation expenses to each study visit, provided to&#xD;
      participants at the conclusion of each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 Pilot intervention trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent forms and data collection materials will be generated based on findings from the&#xD;
      formative work conducted in Aim1. These materials will be submitted for approval as a&#xD;
      modification prior to initiation of the pilot trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention package: The intervention package will be piloted at the 4 intervention&#xD;
      facilities and compared to the 4 control facilities. The intervention package will consist of&#xD;
      a WhatsApp group that is setup and organized by the study. Participants will be divided into&#xD;
      1-3 WhatsApp groups, each with 10-55 youth. Each group will be facilitated by a study staff&#xD;
      member trained as a counselor (the same facilitator will facilitate all groups). The&#xD;
      facilitator will send weekly messages to the group, containing content related to the topic&#xD;
      areas outlined in Table 4. Messages from the facilitator will not contain overtly HIV-related&#xD;
      language. These messages are intended to spark unstructured discussion among study&#xD;
      participants, or with the facilitator, at any time through the WhatsApp group or&#xD;
      individually. Subsequent messages from the study will answer participant questions or correct&#xD;
      misinformation. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) will be developed for standardizing&#xD;
      responses to the questions received so that study staff follow national guidelines and local&#xD;
      practice standards to respond. The process will be adaptive as new scenarios unfold - a new&#xD;
      question not addressed by the SOPs will be discussed by study team and SOP developed if it is&#xD;
      a question likely to be encountered repeatedly. Weekly review of the log of WhatsApp chats by&#xD;
      the study PIs will enable standardization and quality assurance of WhatsApp interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the start of the intervention, participants will be invited to attend an optional&#xD;
      in-person meeting at the study clinic with the other members of their WhatsApp group to&#xD;
      establish connection and discuss the name and agreements of the group. This meeting will be a&#xD;
      completely optional component of the intervention. Participants who attend this meeting will&#xD;
      be provided refreshments and KSh400 (approximately $4) to compensate for their time and&#xD;
      transportation expenses, provided at the end of the meeting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team will monitor the discussion to learn about the content of the discussions and&#xD;
      how it relates to the intervention aims. We will also monitor for abusive or problematic&#xD;
      content or behavior in the discussion and will intervene if necessary. Guidelines and ground&#xD;
      rules for the discussion group will be presented to all members when they begin participation&#xD;
      and all participants will be informed that the content of the discussions will be monitored&#xD;
      by the study team. They will also be informed that the content will be kept confidential, but&#xD;
      that it is possible that members of the discussion group could potentially disclose&#xD;
      confidential information outside of the group, though this will be explicitly discouraged by&#xD;
      the study team. The technology development for the intervention package will be conducted by&#xD;
      a contractor that has not yet been identified. The identity of the contractor will be&#xD;
      submitted to the ERC prior to the start of the contract period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: The pilot trial will be conducted at 8 facilities. To maximize internal&#xD;
      validity of the pilot, facilities will be selected based on adequate number of youth in care&#xD;
      and similarity of youth patient populations. We will randomly select 4 facilities to receive&#xD;
      the intervention and 4 facilities to serve as control sites. Eligible participants will be&#xD;
      youth aged 16-24 living with HIV, who have daily access to a mobile phone (their own or&#xD;
      shared) that can access the intervention technology platform. The stage of transition at&#xD;
      which youth become eligible will be based on their score on the Transition Readiness&#xD;
      Assessment Questionnaire (TRAQ), with the threshold for eligibility to be determined in Aim&#xD;
      1. If Aim 1 indicates that peer chat groups should be tailored based on youth characteristics&#xD;
      (e.g., route of transmission, developmental age), we will limit the trial to the subgroup&#xD;
      with the largest number of youth, but will also assess interest among youth from other&#xD;
      subgroups in participating in a future peer intervention. We will enroll 50 participants from&#xD;
      intervention facilities (~12 at each facility) to receive the intervention for 12 months and&#xD;
      50 participants from control facilities who will be followed for 12 months without&#xD;
      intervention. Based on data from the ongoing ATP study, we estimate 20% of facilities&#xD;
      nationally have at least 50 patients in this age group engaged in care annually. We expect to&#xD;
      complete enrollment within 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of intervention impact: A screening questionnaire will be used to assess&#xD;
      eligibility and collect sociodemographic characteristics such as age, school attendance and&#xD;
      technology access of all screened individuals. In order to evaluate the intervention's reach&#xD;
      and uptake, differences in these characteristics between screened and enrolled participants&#xD;
      will be assessed by chi-squared test for categorical and t-test for continuous variables. At&#xD;
      baseline (enrollment) and endline (12 months), participants will complete a standardized&#xD;
      questionnaire to evaluate intermediate outcomes in our intervention framework. Participants&#xD;
      who do not return for their 12-month visit will be traced by phone call and home visit.&#xD;
      Participants will be provided refreshments and KSh 400 to compensate for their time and&#xD;
      transportation expenses to each study visit, provided to participants at the conclusion of&#xD;
      each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mediating and moderating factors: Based on our conceptual model linking the intervention to&#xD;
      elements of social support that promote the care transition, we expect the intervention will&#xD;
      affect successful transition through multiple mechanisms. While the pilot trial is not&#xD;
      powered to assess impact on primary transition outcomes, we will focus on its impact on&#xD;
      hypothesized mediators.&#xD;
