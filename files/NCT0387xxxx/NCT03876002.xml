      The overall goal of this protocol is to evaluate microglial activation in the brain using&#xD;
      [18F]PBR06 in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The specific objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the dynamic uptake and washout of [18F]PBR06 (Peripheral benzodiazepine&#xD;
           receptor-06) in brain using positron emission tomography (PET) in patients with ALS and&#xD;
           healthy volunteers (HV).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate test/retest reliability of the tracer binding parameters in patients with&#xD;
           ALS and HV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the correlation of [18F]PBR06 binding with ALS disease clinical severity&#xD;
           (ALSFRS-R, upper motor neuron burden (UMNB) and Ashworth Score), clinical disease&#xD;
           sub-categorization, and other clinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To perform kinetic modeling using plasma-based (metabolite corrected plasma&#xD;
           concentration) or reference region based methods or simplified quantification methods to&#xD;
           assess the ability of [18F]PBR06 PET to measure microglial activation in brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To acquire safety data following injection of [18F]PBR06.&#xD;

    <description>Time-activity data will be analyzed with 2-tissue compartment model, using the radiometabolite-corrected plasma input function. To correct the brain data for its vascular component, radioactivity in serial whole blood will be measured and then subtracted from the PET measurements. Non-invasive simple tissue ratio methods will also be evaluated.</description>
