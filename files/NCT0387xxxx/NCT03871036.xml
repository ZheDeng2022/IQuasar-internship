    <textblock>
      This trial will include metastatic urothelial carcinoma patients who progressed during or&#xD;
      after treatment with anti-PD(L)1 therapy and have been treated by a platinum-containing&#xD;
      regimen, or are cisplatin-ineligible. Patients will receive either paclitaxel in combination&#xD;
      with durvalumab (anti-PDL-1) and a single dose (300 mg) of tremelimumab (anti-CTLA4), or&#xD;
      paclitaxel with only a high dose of tremelimumab (750 mg). Tremelimumab (750 mg), without&#xD;
      paclitaxel will be used as a comparison arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A run-in safety phase will be followed by a non-comparative 3-arm randomized study with a&#xD;
      Simon's 2-stage optimal design.&#xD;

      This trial will include metastatic urothelial carcinoma patients who progressed during or&#xD;
      after treatment with anti-PD(L)1 therapy and have been treated by a platinum-containing&#xD;
      regimen, or are cisplatin-ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A run-in safety phase will be followed by a non-comparative 3-arm randomized study with a&#xD;
      Simon's 2-stage optimal design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before enrollment, patients will need to complete the following screening procedures (among&#xD;
      other assessments):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline evaluation by CT chest/abdomen/pelvis (&lt;4 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tissue biopsy (in at least 6 patients per arm)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Run-in phase-1 (R1): n=3 patients will be treated with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  paclitaxel 70 mg/m2 on day 1, 8, 15 of cycles 1-6&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  tremelimumab 75 mg on day 1 of cycles 2-6 and then every 12 weeks until week 45&#xD;
&#xD;
      Run-in phase-2 (R2): n=3 patients will be treated with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  paclitaxel 70 mg/m2 on day 1, 8, 15 of cycles 1-6&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  tremelimumab 225 mg on day 1 of cycles 2-6 and then every 12 weeks until week 45&#xD;
&#xD;
      Run-in phase-3 (R3): n=2 x 3 patients will be randomized over 2 arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  paclitaxel 70 mg/m2 on day 1, 8, 15 of cycles 1-6&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  tremelimumab 750 mg on day 1 of cycles 2-6 and then every 12 weeks until week 45 OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  paclitaxel 70 mg/m2 on day 1, 8, 15 of cycles 1-6&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  tremelimumab 75 mg on day 1 of cycles 2-5&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  durvalumab 1500 mg on day 1 of cycles 2-12, every four weeks (until week 49)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Run-in phase-4 (R4): n=3 patients will be treated with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  paclitaxel 70 mg/m2 on day 1, 8, 15 of cycles 1-6&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  tremelimumab 300 mg once on day 1 of cycle 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  durvalumab 1500 mg on day 1 of cycles 2-12, every four weeks (until week 49)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment will start with the first run-in cohort (R1) and will be halted after inclusion of&#xD;
      the 3rd patient, until 60 days after start of treatment of this patient. Stopping rules are&#xD;
      defined in the section 6.3 of the protocol. In case unexpected toxicity occurs (either as&#xD;
      defined by the stopping rules or otherwise unexpected severe toxicity), the study team will&#xD;
      discuss with the IDMC whether expansion to include 3 additional subjects is warranted. If no&#xD;
      unexpected toxicity has occurred within 60 days after initiation of treatment of the 3rd&#xD;
      patient of R1, enrollment for R2 will begin in a similar fashion. If 2 or more&#xD;
      nonhematological toxicities as described in section 6.3 &quot;Definition of DLT&quot; occur in R1 or&#xD;
      R2, enrollment will be suspended until the IDMC has formulated an advice. After this advice,&#xD;
      the sponsor will decide on continuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If no unexpected toxicity has occurred within 60 days after initiation of treatment of the&#xD;
      3rd patient of R2, the study will continue with a third run-in cohort (R3) where patients&#xD;
      will be randomized over 2 arms (R3A and R3B), n=3 per arm. If no unexpected toxicity has&#xD;
      occurred within 60 days after initiation of treatment of the 3rd patient in arm R3A, this arm&#xD;
      will be continued into the main study phase (as Arm A). If unacceptable toxicity is observed&#xD;
      at either 225 mg or 750 mg of tremelimumab during one of the run-in cohorts, a lower dose&#xD;
      level can be used in the main study. In addition, after completion of R3A and continuation in&#xD;
      the main study phase, a control arm (Arm C) will be initiated where patients will be treated&#xD;
      with tremelimumab monotherapy (without paclitaxel).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If no unexpected toxicity has occurred within 60 days after initiation of treatment of the&#xD;
      3rd patient of R3B, enrollment for run-in cohort R4 will begin in a similar fashion as&#xD;
      described for the earlier run-in cohorts. Expansion arms A and C will be paused while this&#xD;
      cohort is enrolling. If no unexpected toxicity has occurred within 60 days after initiation&#xD;
      of treatment of the 3rd patient of R4, enrollment for arm R4 will be continued into the main&#xD;
      study phase (as Arm B). If unacceptable toxicity is observed at 300 mg of tremelimumab in&#xD;
      combination with 1500mg durvalumab, arm B, combining paclitaxel, tremelimumab and durvalumab,&#xD;
      will be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  paclitaxel 70 mg/m2 on day 1, 8, 15 of cycles 1-6&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  tremelimumab 750 mg on day 1 of cycles 2-6 and then every 12 weeks until week 45&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  paclitaxel 70 mg/m2 on day 1, 8, 15 of cycles 1-6&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  tremelimumab 300 mg once on day 1 of cycle 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  durvalumab 1500 mg on day 1 of cycles 2-12, every four weeks (until week 49)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm C (control arm):&#xD;
&#xD;
      • tremelimumab 750 mg on day 1 of cycles 1-5 and then every 12 weeks until week 41&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment will be halted when 12 patients are enrolled in each arm; this will include&#xD;
      patients treated in R3 at the dose level used in the main study. These patients will be&#xD;
      included in the efficacy analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the last patient has had the second evaluation scan, the Objective Response Rate (ORR)&#xD;
      of each treatment arm will be evaluated. If one or more of the experimental arms has ≥2&#xD;
      responses, the study team will discuss continuation of one of the experimental arms to n=20&#xD;
      with the IDMC. In case 2 responses are seen in one of the arms prior to the second evaluation&#xD;
      scan of the last patient, a decision on expansion of that arm may be recommended earlier.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Capable of giving signed informed consent which includes compliance with the&#xD;
             requirements and restrictions listed in the informed consent form (ICF) and in this&#xD;
             protocol. Written informed consent and any locally required authorization (eg,&#xD;
             European Union [EU] Data Privacy Directive) obtained from the patient/legal&#xD;
             representative prior to performing any protocol-related procedures, including&#xD;
             screening evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with histologically or cytologically documented metastatic or irresectable&#xD;
             (i.e. T4b, N1-3 and/or M1a/b) urothelial cell carcinoma (including renal pelvis,&#xD;
             ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients ineligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy OR previous treatment with&#xD;
             platinum-based chemotherapy, either in the neo-adjuvant setting or in any other&#xD;
             setting. This is defined as progression on or after at least 2 cycles of&#xD;
             platinum-based chemotherapy (e.g. MVAC, cisplatin/gemcitabine,&#xD;
             carpoblatin/gemcitabine). Patients who had to stop platinum-based therapy because of&#xD;
             toxicity after at least 2 cycles are eligible if progressive disease has been&#xD;
             confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Previous treatment with anti-PD(L)1 immunotherapy. The following conditions apply for&#xD;
             inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Must not have experienced a toxicity that led to permanent discontinuation of&#xD;
                  prior anti-PD(L)1 immunotherapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. All treatment-related AEs while receiving prior anti-PD(L)1 immunotherapy must&#xD;
                  have completely resolved or resolved to baseline prior to screening for this&#xD;
                  study;&#xD;

               3. Must not have experienced a ≥Grade 3 immune related AE or an immune related&#xD;
                  neurologic or ocular AE of any grade while receiving prior anti-PD(L)1&#xD;
                  immunotherapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Patients with endocrine AE of ≤Grade 2 are permitted to enroll if the AEs are&#xD;
                  stably maintained on appropriate replacement therapy and are asymptomatic;&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Must not have required the use of additional immunosuppression other than&#xD;
                  corticosteroids for the management of an AE, not have experienced recurrence of&#xD;
                  an AE if re-challenged, and not currently require maintenance doses of &gt;10 mg&#xD;
                  prednisone or equivalent per day;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. At least 1 lesion, not previously irradiated, that can be accurately measured at&#xD;
             baseline as ≥10 mm in the longest diameter (except lymph nodes which must have a&#xD;
             Revised Clinical Study Protocol short axis ≥15 mm) with computed tomography (CT) or&#xD;
             magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and that is suitable for accurate repeated&#xD;
