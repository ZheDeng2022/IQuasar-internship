      Background To optimise cancer outcome in Denmark, cancer diagnostic pathways should, beside&#xD;
      cancer patient pathways (CPP) for alarm symptoms, also include a pathway for patients with&#xD;
      vague and non-specific symptoms. Research has demonstrated that 50% of all cancers do not&#xD;
      qualify for specific CPPs, although the majority of patients initially present symptoms in&#xD;
      general practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Direct access to an abdominal 'yes-no' pathway is feasible in general practice.&#xD;
      Aim The aim of this study is to assess the implementation and clinical implications of direct&#xD;
      access to an abdominal 'yes-no' pathway for primary care patients with vague and non-specific&#xD;
      abdominal symptoms Materials and methods The study is a feasibility study in which all&#xD;
      general practitioners (GPs) in the municipality of Silkeborg in Central Denmark Region are&#xD;
      offered direct access to a newly developed abdominal ´yes-no´ pathway for both men and women&#xD;
      aged 30 years or above, who present vague and non-specific abdominal symptoms in primary&#xD;
      care. The abdominal ´yes-no´ pathway consists of: 1) Medical and objective examination, 2)&#xD;
      Selected blood samples and a Fecal Immunochemical test (FIT), and 3) Abdominal ultrasound&#xD;
      (US) and transvaginal US (TVUS) (for women).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives This study will provide important knowledge on how to improve abdominal cancer&#xD;
      diagnostics in general practice.&#xD;

      Background Danish cancer patients have poorer cancer outcome compared to other European&#xD;
      cancer patients. Earlier cancer diagnosis is a pivotal step to improve the prognosis, and&#xD;
      there seems to be opportunity for improvement, as e.g. colon cancer is more often diagnosed&#xD;
      at an advanced stage in Denmark than in other countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Denmark, more than 11,500 abdominal cancers are registered yearly, which corresponds to&#xD;
      31% of all newly diagnosed cancers. The majority (75-85%) of cancer patients initially&#xD;
      present symptoms to their GP. But only half of the patients present an alarm symptom, while&#xD;
      20% present serious non-specific symptoms, and 30% present vague non-specific symptoms.&#xD;
      Site-specific CPPs for alarm symptoms were implemented in Denmark in 2008/2009 to optimise&#xD;
      the diagnostic route for cancer. In 2012, a new Danish CPP was implemented to target patients&#xD;
      with serious non-specific symptoms and signs of cancer (NSSC-CPP). No pathway exists for&#xD;
      patients with vague abdominal symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presenting in general practice with abdominal symptoms is very common. Most abdominal&#xD;
      symptoms presented in general practice can be signs of serious disease in the abdomen and the&#xD;
      pelvic region. However, in most cases, the symptoms are benign, self-limiting and harmless.&#xD;
      Still, more than ten different cancer types can cause these symptoms, but clinically it is&#xD;
      often difficult to distinguish between the symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients presenting vague symptoms to the GP, the ideal strategy could be easy and direct&#xD;
      access to relevant investigations rather than a wait-and-see approach or referral to a CPP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim The study sets out to investigate the need for an abdominal 'yes-no' pathway for primary&#xD;
      care patients with vague and non-specific abdominal symptoms, how it could be clinically&#xD;
      organised and integrated, and whether such pathway is feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods Prior to the current intervention, a developmental part was conducted in&#xD;
      2018. It consisted of focus group meetings with 16 selected specialist, with expertise&#xD;
      regarding patients with abdominal symptoms in general practice and abdominal cancers and&#xD;
      other abdominal diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators assembled two focus groups during autumn 2017, each comprising the&#xD;
      following experts: two GPs, a physician with expertise in gastroenterology, an abdominal&#xD;
      surgeon, a radiologist, a gynecologist, a microbiologist and a physician in clinical&#xD;
      biochemistry. The focus groups aimed to develop and agree on an abdominal 'yes-no' pathway&#xD;
      using the following criteria: 1) reduce the time to diagnosis, 2) avoid unnecessary tests, 3)&#xD;
      increase patient safety and minimise missed opportunities, 4) order the specific&#xD;
      investigations temporally, 5) place responsibility and develop a structure and 6) illustrate&#xD;
      an optimal pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From January to September 2018, the investigators completed two meetings in each focus group,&#xD;
      after which the investigators compared the results and gathered the groups in a common&#xD;
      session. From the literature and the preliminary results of an yet unpublished register&#xD;
      study, the investigators were able to present the clinical challenges to the participants&#xD;
      during the meetings. Moreover, the possible access to investigations was presented&#xD;
      (laboratory tests, imaging, endoscopies and access to specialist advice). Based on&#xD;
      discussions during the meetings, the investigators developed an abdominal ´yes-no´ pathway.&#xD;
      The abdominal ´yes-no´ pathway consists of three steps; 1) Medical and objective examination,&#xD;
      2) Selected blood samples and a FIT, and 3) Abdominal US and TVUS. The GP continues to hold&#xD;
      responsibility for follow-up, while hospital examinations are performed on an outpatient&#xD;
      basis with direct access from general practice. After finished investigation, the results&#xD;
      from the tests will all return electronically to the referring GP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is planned to initiate as a feasibility study at Silkeborg Regional Hospital&#xD;
      from 1 April 2019. Agreements have been made with the hospital management, and an information&#xD;
      meeting has taken place in March 2019 at the hospital. All GPs in the municipality of&#xD;
      Silkeborg were invited to participate. An illustration, to hand out for involved GPs has been&#xD;
      developed. Prior to investigation, all patients referred to the abdominal ´yes-no´ pathway&#xD;
      will receive a consent form with information of the study. The inclusion period is 6 months&#xD;
      from 1 April 2019 to 30 September 2019, after which the investigators will monitor the&#xD;
      patients for up to 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has been approved and is registered in the Record of Processing Activities at the&#xD;
      Research Unit of General Practice in Aarhus in accordance with the provisions of the General&#xD;
      Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The Central Denmark Region Committees on Health Research&#xD;
      Ethics has concluded that the study can be conducted without an approval from the Committees&#xD;
      (Request 16/2019). Further, The committee on multi-practice studies under the Danish College&#xD;
      of General Practitioners (DSAM) and the Organisation of General Practitioners in Denmark&#xD;
      (PLO) have been asked to recommend GPs to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analyses will be descriptive with frequencies and incidence rates of use of the pathway&#xD;
      corrected for practice population. An overview of all findings in the abdominal 'yes-no'&#xD;
      pathway will be provided, and possible side effects will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives The study will provide new important knowledge of patients with vague and&#xD;
      non-specific abdominal symptoms, who do not fulfil access criteria for the CPPs, but for whom&#xD;
      the diagnosis of an abdominal cancer should not be missed. This may improve the diagnostics&#xD;
      of abdominal cancers or other serious abdominal disease in the future, aiming to reduce time&#xD;
      to diagnosis.&#xD;
