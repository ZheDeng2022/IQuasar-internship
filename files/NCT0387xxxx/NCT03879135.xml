    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the long-term safety and hemostatic efficacy of recombinant von&#xD;
      Willebrand factor (rVWF) (vonicog alfa) prophylaxis in adult and pediatric participants (aged&#xD;
      12 to &lt;18 years) with severe von Willebrand disease (VWD) with the option of once weekly&#xD;
      dosing, and to further assess the safety and efficacy of rVWF in on-demand (OD) treatment of&#xD;
      bleeding episodes, and in perioperative management of surgical bleeding.&#xD;

      22 JUN 2020: The temporary enrollment stop of new patients into this study due to the&#xD;
      COVID-10 pandemic has been lifted in one or more countries/sites, and the study is now again&#xD;
      enrolling new patients. However, some countries/sites may still have paused the enrollment of&#xD;
      new patients due to the pandemic.&#xD;
