      This phase 1 dose-escalation and dose-expansion study is designed to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of olaparib in combination with 177Lutetium-Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen&#xD;
      (177 Lu-PSMA) in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase 1, open label, multicentre, dose-escalation and dose-expansion study is designed&#xD;
      to evaluate the safety and tolerability of olaparib in combination with 177Lu-PSMA in&#xD;
      patients with mCRPC. Patients with mCRPC who have previously progressed on a novel AR&#xD;
      targeted agent (abiraterone and/or enzalutamide and/or apalutamide) and have not had prior&#xD;
      exposure to platinums, PARP inhibitors or 177Lu-PSMA will be eligible for the study. Patients&#xD;
      can have had prior exposure to docetaxel in the chemotherapy naïve setting or castrate&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled in two stages: a dose escalation and a dose expansion phase. The&#xD;
      clinical and translational outcomes from this study will inform the design of future phase&#xD;
      2/3 clinical trials of this combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single arm study where patients will receive 177Lu-PSMA and olaparib for upto 4&#xD;
      cycles.&#xD;
