  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled,&#xD;
      non-inferiority trial designed to assess the efficacy and safety of Brexpiprazole in the&#xD;
      Treatment of Adults With Acute Schizophrenia. A total of approximately 370 subjects will be&#xD;
      included in the study, and randomized to Brexpiprazole (2~4 mg/d) or Aripiprazole (10~20&#xD;
      mg/d) in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Screening Phase: It will begin when informed consent form (ICF) is signed and be a maximum of&#xD;
      14 days, to evaluate the inclusion/exclusion criteria, collect information such as&#xD;
      demographic data, medical history, wash out previous antipsychotic agents and other&#xD;
      prohibited concomitant medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double-blind Treatment Phase: It lasts 6 weeks; the purpose is to compare the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of Brexpiprazole with Aripiprazole in the treatment of adults with acute&#xD;
      schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Phase: All subjects will be followed up for safety reasons via telephone contact or&#xD;
      clinic visit 30 (+ 2) days after the last dose of investigational medicinal product,&#xD;
      collecting safety information (adverse events and concomitant medication).&#xD;

    <measure>Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) measures psychotic symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. PANSS includes 30 items (7 items for positive symptoms, 7 items for negative symptoms, and 16 items for general psychopathology symptoms), and each item ranges from 1 to 7. The PANSS total score is a sum of scores from all items, ranging from 30 to 210, where a higher score represents severer psychotic symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) score ranges from 1 to 7. A higher score represents a severer clinical impression on the patient's severity based on investigator/clinician's judgment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP) global score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP) contains four domains: socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, self-care, and disturbing and aggressive behavior. A higher domain score represents worse functional performance in each domain. The final global score is defined according to a summary instruction table converting four domain scores into a single, overall rating from 1 to 100, where a higher score represents better personal and social function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) positive scale score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) positive scale includes 7 items, assessing positive symptoms in schizophrenia such as delusion, hallucinatory or excitement, and each item ranges from 1 to 7. The positive scale score is a sum of scores from the 7 items, ranging from 7 to 49, where a higher score represents severer schizophrenia positive symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) negative scale score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) negative scale includes 7 items, assessing negative symptoms in schizophrenia such as blunted affect or emotional withdrawal, and each item ranges from 1 to 7. The negative scale score is a sum of scores from the 7 items, ranging from 7 to 49, where a higher score represents severer schizophrenia negative symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) score ranges from 1 to 7. A higher score represents a poorer clinical impression on the patient's improvement based on investigator/clinician's judgment.</description>
