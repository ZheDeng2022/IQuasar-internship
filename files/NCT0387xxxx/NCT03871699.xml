      In general, anemia is associated with a greater presence of HF symptoms, worsening NYHA&#xD;
      functional class, higher rate of hospitalization for heart failure, and reduced survival.&#xD;
      However, it is unclear whether anemia is the cause of decreased survival or a marker for more&#xD;
      advanced disease. Correction of iron deficiency in patients with New York Heart Association&#xD;
      (NYHA) class II or III HF using intravenous iron (Ferinject®) improved &quot;overall patient&#xD;
      self-assessment&quot; and NYHA functional class of 6-minute walk and health-related quality of&#xD;
      life) in the FAIR-HF trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is unknown if iron deficiency is correlated with intra-myocardial iron load as assessed by&#xD;
      cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and if the treatment with intravenous iron has any impact on&#xD;
      intra-myocardial iron load and left ventricular function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effect of intravenous iron replacement on&#xD;
      intra-myocardial iron deposits and the effect on left ventricular function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because it is a pilot study with few data in the literature, it is planned to use an initial&#xD;
      sample of 20 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to evaluate the global ventricular function, the iron load by the T2 * method, the&#xD;
      cardiac strain, the &quot;Fiddle&quot; and the &quot;Fat water&quot; of each patient by CMR. After this&#xD;
      examination, patients will undergo intravenous infusion of 1g of Ferric Carboxymaltose&#xD;
      (Ferinject®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comparative analysis of the ejection fraction values at the beginning and at the end of the&#xD;
      study by CMR will be performed, in addition to a clinical reassessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria will be: Patients older than 18 years, with iron deficiency and&#xD;
      reduced ejection fraction defined as: serum ferritin &lt;100 μg / L or with ferritin 100-299 μg&#xD;
      / L with transferrin saturation &lt;20 %; Hemoglobin &lt;12g / dL in women and &lt;13g / dL in men;&#xD;
      Clinical stability in the last 3 months; Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;40%&#xD;
      assessed by transthoracic echocardiography or CMR in the last 3 months. The exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be: patients with preserved ejection fraction (&gt; 50%), pregnant women, refusal&#xD;
      to participate in the present study, implantable pacemaker or implantable defibrillator&#xD;
      incompatible with MRI, cerebral cerebral aneurysm clip and/or intracerebral or intraocular&#xD;
      metal fragments, electronic cochlear implants, patients with claustrophobia, patients with&#xD;
      clinical or hemodynamic instability and patients with indication for blood transfusion (Hb ≤&#xD;
      7g / dL).&#xD;

      Anemia (defined as a hemoglobin concentration below 13 g / dL in men and less than 12 g / dL&#xD;
      in women) is a condition frequently associated with heart failure (HF), and its prevalence is&#xD;
      estimated at around 4% to 50 %, depending on the study population and the adopted definition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, anemia is associated with a greater presence of HF symptoms, worsening NYHA&#xD;
      functional class, higher rate of hospitalization for heart failure, and reduced survival.&#xD;
      However, it is unclear whether anemia is the cause of decreased survival or a marker for more&#xD;
      advanced disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The etiology of anemia is multifactorial, including reduced sensitivity to erythropoietin&#xD;
      receptors, presence of a hematopoiesis inhibitor and / or a defective iron supply for&#xD;
      erythropoiesis. There is growing evidence that iron availability may be reduced absolutely&#xD;
      due to decreased enteral iron absorption and / or occult hemorrhage, as well as in relative&#xD;
      form, resulting from the dysregulation of iron homeostasis and accumulation of iron in cells&#xD;
      of the reticuloendothelial system, characteristic of chronic disease anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, it has been suggested that iron deficiency itself may be an independent predictor&#xD;
      of outcome in HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correction of iron deficiency in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or&#xD;
      III HF using intravenous iron (Ferinject®) improved &quot;overall patient self-assessment&quot; and&#xD;
      NYHA functional class of 6-minute walk and health-related quality of life) in the FAIR-HF&#xD;
      trial. The treatment of patients with heart failure with mild to moderate anemia (hemoglobin&#xD;
      levels from 9.0 to 12.0 g / dL) with the erythropoietin analogue, darbepoetin alfa was&#xD;
      evaluated in the RED-HF trial (Reduction of Events with Darbepoetin Alfa in Heart Failure).&#xD;
      No differences in the primary end point of death from any cause or hospitalization due to HF,&#xD;
      or in the secondary outcome of cardiovascular death or time until the first hospitalization&#xD;
      due to HF. The absence of darbepoetin was consistent across all subgroups. Of relevant,&#xD;
      treatment with darbepoetin alfa led to an early increase (within one month) and sustained in&#xD;
      the hemoglobin level throughout the study. These RED-HF trial results suggest that the level&#xD;
      of hemoglobin, as well as other sub- stantial outcomes in HF, may be a prognostic marker,&#xD;
      with decreased levels correlated with a worse prognosis, rather than a therapeutic target of&#xD;
      HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 2009 study tested the hypothesis of the association between anemia and HF severity, and the&#xD;
      outcome could be explained by the emptying of iron stores, particularly at the myocardium&#xD;
      level. This concept is based on previous experimental work showing that iron deficiency is&#xD;
      associated with progressive left ventricular dysfunction and cardiac fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although serum ferritin is clinically used to estimate body iron stores, it reports&#xD;
      approximately 1% of the total iron storage pool and its measurement can be confounded by a&#xD;
      number of conditions, such as inflammation, abnormal liver function, and ascorbic acid&#xD;
      deficiency. In contrast to serum ferritin, hepatic iron may serve as a better indicator of&#xD;
      serum iron; however, it does not reflect myocardial iron. Cardiac iron overload and related&#xD;
      toxicity may occur despite low hepatic iron concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of cardiac iron represented a major challenge to society. Endomyocardial biopsy&#xD;
      is highly risky and potentially imprecise due to the small sample size and the heterogeneous&#xD;
      deposition of cardiac iron. The introduction of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR)&#xD;
      provided a reliable measure of tissue iron and revolutionized our understanding and&#xD;
      management of iron-induced cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron, because is paramagnetic, can be quantified by Magnetic Resonance (MRI) in both the&#xD;
      liver and the heart through a method called T2 * (T2 &quot;star&quot;). Myocardial iron deposition can&#xD;
      be detected using myocardial T2 * and is the most important variable for predicting a need&#xD;
      for treatment for ventricular dysfunction in the context of iron overload (eg,&#xD;
      polytransfusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinically important iron load is defined as T2 * with values less than 20 ms, and is&#xD;
      considered serious if it is less than 10 ms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2016, a study in Spain evaluated patients with heart failure (with or without anemia) and&#xD;
      their response to intravenous iron infusion. These patients, initially with mean T2* values&#xD;
      of 39.5 msec, were followed by Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) before and after iron&#xD;
      replacement with Ferric Carboxymaltose (Ferinject®) , obtaining at the end of the study,&#xD;
      improvement in ventricular function and increase in the myocardial iron load (T2 * mean of 32&#xD;
      msec ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study was to evaluate the correlation between intravenous iron&#xD;
      replacement and increased intra-myocardial iron deposits and their effect on ventricular&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the CMR, the global ventricular function, the iron load by the &quot;T2 * method&quot;, the cardiac&#xD;
      &quot;Strain&quot; and the &quot;Fat Water&quot; of each patient will be analyzed. After this examination,&#xD;
      patients will undergo intravenous 1g of Ferric Carboxymaltose (Ferinject®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comparative analysis of the ejection fraction values at the beginning and at the end of the&#xD;
      study by CMR will be performed, in addition to a clinical reassessment, in which improvement&#xD;
      of dyspnea and tiredness are expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be laboratory reassessment of ferritin and transferrin saturation to monitor&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
