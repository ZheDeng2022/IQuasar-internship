  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that a consistent use of Medium cut-off membrane (Theranova) increased&#xD;
      clearance of pro-inflammatory molecules in a broad molecular weight range attenuates the&#xD;
      chronic inflammatory state in patients with poor response to ESA therapy and absence of&#xD;
      absolute iron deficiency and that this leads to an improvement in ESA responsiveness (EPO&#xD;
      resistance index).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hemodialysis Patients present chronic inflammation caused by multiple inflammatory stimuli.&#xD;
      Chronic inflammation is linked to clinical signs and symptoms and cardiovascular mortality in&#xD;
      these patients. Inflamed dialysis patients show impaired response to&#xD;
      erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) mainly related to a reduced iron utilization&#xD;
      (functional iron deficiency) with a greater need for ESA to meet hemoglobin targets. If&#xD;
      absolute iron deficiency can been excluded, EPO resistance is likely related to 'inflammatory&#xD;
      block'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The high molecular permeability of the Theranova Medium cut-off membrane allows for&#xD;
      significant clearance of medium molecular toxins and we know that a number of uremic solutes&#xD;
      have been identified as pro-inflammatory, including several with a molecular weight in the&#xD;
      size range of 20-45 kDa (cytokines, kappa/lambda free light chains and hepcidine). The EPO&#xD;
      index has been previously used in clinical trials to measure EPO responsiveness [2,3] and is&#xD;
      associated with mortality of ESRD patients [4-7].&#xD;
&#xD;
      All AE, SAE and other safety issues will be collected and described. The even review&#xD;
      committee could be consulted in case of Safety event, and give recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data entry to be carried out into an electronic CRF hosted database. This database allows the&#xD;
      follow-up of any modifications made during data entry and monitoring. Data consistency will&#xD;
      be checked on line according to the procedure described in the Data Management Plan (DMP), as&#xD;
      part of the Study Master File. Each eCRF follows the study schedule structure. It is divided&#xD;
      in sections for each visits or specific forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be consecutively randomized in a 1:1 fashion to the standard dialysis&#xD;
      or to dialysis with MCO dialyzer. The random sequence will be centrally generated in the CRF&#xD;
      tool. The randomization procedure will be stratified per centre. Size of block is only known&#xD;
      by the statistician to keep the investigator blinded regarding group allocation for the next&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient must be identified on the CRF with his initials and identification number.&#xD;
      Investigators must keep the list of all the patients, including identification numbers, full&#xD;
      names and last known addresses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must be informed that the results obtained will be computer-stored and analyzed,&#xD;
      that local laws must be applied, that patient's confidentiality must be preserved, and that&#xD;
      they are entitled to obtain any information concerning the data stored and analyzed by a&#xD;
      computerized system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator must give the Study Monitor direct access to relevant hospital or clinical&#xD;
      records to confirm their consistency with the CRF entries. No information in these records&#xD;
      about the identity of the subjects will leave the study site. Standards requirement is full&#xD;
      verification for the presence of informed consent, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria, documentation of SAEs and the recording of primary efficacy and safety variables.&#xD;
      Additional checks of the consistency of the source data with the CRFs are performed according&#xD;
      to the study-specific monitoring plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final statistical analysis will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP),&#xD;
      which will be prepared and signed prior to clean file. The SAP will include detailed&#xD;
      information regarding the analysis of safety and efficacy. Per protocol dataset will be&#xD;
      defined by Endpoint Review Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering these assumptions, it is estimated that 55 patients per group will be required&#xD;
      for a mean follow- up period of 48 weeks. A total number of 110 patients is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be analyzed by ANOVA for repeated measurements. Data will be&#xD;
      expressed as mean standard deviation if normally distributed or as percentile of the&#xD;
      distribution elsewhere for continuous variables and as proportion for dichotomous variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators must keep essential study documents (including all original raw data&#xD;
      together with the patients' identification list and signed informed consents) minimum 5 years&#xD;
      after product commercialization is stopped and should be retained for a longer period however&#xD;
      if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by an agreement with the sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient medical files have to be kept as much as possible at each investigation site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will be informed by Sponsor when documents related to the study could be&#xD;
      deleted. Prior to destroying study-related documentation, the investigator shall make sure&#xD;
      with the Sponsor, which it does not need to be kept any longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of this clinical study will be submitted to a respected international peer-reviewed&#xD;
      journal. They may also be submitted as abstracts to a scientific congress for oral or poster&#xD;
      communication.&#xD;
