      The mucopolysaccharidoses are a group of inherited lysosomal storage disorders. Lysosomes&#xD;
      function as the primary digestive units within cells. Enzymes within lysosomes break down or&#xD;
      digest particular nutrients, such as certain carbohydrates and fats. In individuals with MPS&#xD;
      disorders, deficiency or malfunction of specific lysosomal enzymes lead to an abnormal&#xD;
      accumulation of certain complex carbohydrates (mucopolysaccharides or glycosaminoglycans) in&#xD;
      the arteries, skeleton, eyes, joints, ears, skin and/or teeth. These accumulations may also&#xD;
      be found in the respiratory system, liver, spleen, central nervous system, blood, and bone&#xD;
      marrow. This accumulation eventually causes progressive damage to cells, tissues, and various&#xD;
      organ systems of the body. There are several different types and subtypes of&#xD;
      mucopolysaccharidosis. These disorders, with one exception, are inherited as autosomal&#xD;
      recessive traits and all vary in their clinical phenotype. Within our clinical trial we focus&#xD;
      on MPS type IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morquio syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis type IV; MPS IV) is a mucopolysaccharide storage&#xD;
      disease that exists in two forms (Morquio syndromes A and B) and occurs because of a&#xD;
      deficiency of the enzymes N-acetyl-galactosamine-6-sulfatase and beta-galactosidase,&#xD;
      respectively. A deficiency of either enzyme leads to the accumulation of mucopolysaccharides&#xD;
      in the body, abnormal skeletal development, and additional symptoms. In most cases,&#xD;
      individuals with Morquio syndrome have normal intelligence. The clinical features of MPS IV-B&#xD;
      are less severe than those associated with MPS IV-A. Symptoms may include growth retardation,&#xD;
      a prominent lower face, an abnormally short neck, knees that are abnormally close together&#xD;
      (knock knees or genu valgum), flat feet, abnormal sideways and front-to-back or side-to-side&#xD;
      curvature of the spine (kyphoscoliosis), abnormal development of the growing ends of the long&#xD;
      bones (epiphyses) resulting in dwarfism, and/or a prominent breast bone (pectus carinatum) as&#xD;
      well as bell shaped chest. Though the CNS and peripheral nerves are primarily not affected&#xD;
      the bone defects may result in neurological symptoms such as spinal cord compression. Hearing&#xD;
      loss, weakness of the legs, and/or additional abnormalities may also occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the study is to prepare a cell culture from patients affected with Morquio&#xD;
      disease in order to identify novel pathways and proteins involved in disease progression that&#xD;
      allow for an earlier diagnosis (i.e. before symptom onset) and that are suitable targets for&#xD;
      an individualized therapeutic approach able to address not only the hepatic form, but also&#xD;
      the neurologic form of the disease, which is less responsive to the current therapeutic&#xD;
      approaches.&#xD;

    <description>The aim of this study is to generate patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells and then differentiate them into chondrocytes to study the accumulation of keratin sulfate (KS) and chondroitin-6-sulfate (C6S), and possible mechanism to reduce the accumulated substances and modulate the defective enzyme</description>

      The skin biopsy will be carried out for patients with a diagnosis of Niemann Pick. The biopsy&#xD;
      is performed by the physician by means of punch biopsy (diameter 2-3 mm) under local&#xD;
      anesthesia, preferably on the forearm (alternatively: thigh). The biopsy is immediately&#xD;
      transferred to sterile cell culture medium and sent by center representative for the quickest&#xD;
      possible processing to CENTOGENE's laboratory located in Germany or to professional&#xD;
      collaborators being part of the project.&#xD;
