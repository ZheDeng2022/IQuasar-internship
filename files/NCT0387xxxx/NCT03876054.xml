    <textblock>
      The REALITY study is a prospective, post-market, non-randomized, multi-center, single-arm,&#xD;
      open-label study intended to collect short- and long-term safety and effectiveness data on&#xD;
      various populations implanted with Abbott's neurostimulation systems.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study has broad inclusion criteria and minimal exclusion criteria to ensure the results&#xD;
      are representative of the real-world use of these devices. Enrollment caps will be&#xD;
      implemented to ensure patients from approved indications are represented. Individuals who are&#xD;
      scheduled to receive an implantable Abbott neurostimulation system are eligible for study&#xD;
      consideration. The study will enroll up to 2,000 subjects from up to 100 participating&#xD;
      centers. Subject enrollment is expected to be completed within 7 years; subjects will be&#xD;
      followed for 5 years. The total duration of the study is expected to be 13 years, including&#xD;
      enrollment, data collection from all subjects, and study close out.&#xD;

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS-29 is used to estimate overall quality of life by assessing the following domains known to impact activities of daily living: physical function, sleep disturbance, depression, anxiety, fatigue, pain interference, pain intensity, and social role satisfaction. The scale requires subjects to rate the frequency and/or severity of symptoms and experiences related to each of these domains. The final item is an 11-point pain intensity numerical rating scale (NRS) by which the subject rates their average pain over the past 7 days. Subjects should read each item and check the one box that most closely represents their response.&#xD;

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pain Catastrophizing Scale is a validated scale that measures the magnitude of catastrophizing (negative thoughts and feelings while a patient is experiencing pain). Subjects answer questions about how they feel and what they think about when they are in pain (i.e., not at the current moment). The scale includes 13 statements concerning pain experiences that are rated on a scale between 0 'not at all' and 4 'all the time'. The scale is self-administered and takes 5 minutes to complete. A higher score indicates a higher level of catastrophizing.&#xD;

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ODI is a 10-item scale that evaluates disability related to low-back and leg pain. It is widely used, validated, and has been translated into several languages. Each section in the scale covers a different domain (pain intensity, personal care, lifting, walking, sitting, standing, sleeping, sex life, social life, and traveling). Each item is scored on a scale from 0-5 with the first item scored a &quot;0&quot; and representing no disability. The final item is scored a &quot;5&quot; and represents the maximum level of disability. If more than one response in a section is checked, the highest score is chosen. The scores for each section are summed for a final score ranging from 0 to 50. If an item is not answered, the total score is instead calculated as a percentage of the total possible score for all items that were completed.&#xD;

    <measure>Mean Change in Clinical improvement from baseline to each follow up visit assessed by Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Years</time_frame>
    <description>The ODI is a 10-item scale that evaluates disability related to low-back and leg pain. It is widely used, validated, and has been translated into several languages. Each section in the scale covers a different domain (pain intensity, personal care, lifting, walking, sitting, standing, sleeping, sex life, social life, and traveling). Each item is scored on a scale from 0-5 with the first item scored a &quot;0&quot; and representing no disability. The final item is scored a &quot;5&quot; and represents the maximum level of disability. If more than one response in a section is checked, the highest score is chosen. The scores for each section are summed for a final score ranging from 0 to 50. If an item is not answered, the total score is instead calculated as a percentage of the total possible score for all items that were completed.&#xD;
This study has no primary or secondary endpoints, all endpoints are of equal weight.</description>
