&#xD;
          -  Healthy male subjects according to the assessment of the investigator, as based on a&#xD;
             complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (Blood Pressure&#xD;
             (BP), Pulse Rate (PR)), 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age of 18 to 50 years (inclusive)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BMI of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (inclusive)&#xD;

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study, in&#xD;
             accordance with GCP and local legislation&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including Blood Pressure (BP), Pulse Rate (PR)&#xD;
             or Electrocardiogram (ECG) and including the neurological examination) deviating from&#xD;
             normal and assessed as clinically relevant by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg,&#xD;
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 50 to 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the&#xD;
             range of 45 to 90 bpm&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be&#xD;
             of clinical relevance&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease assessed as clinically relevant by the&#xD;
             investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,&#xD;
             immunological or hormonal disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cholecystectomy or other surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere&#xD;
             with the pharmacokinetics of the trial medication (except appendectomy or simple&#xD;
             hernia repair)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of&#xD;
             seizures or stroke), and other relevant neurological or psychiatric disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells, or blackouts&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic or relevant acute infections&#xD;
&#xD;

             medication or its excipients)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of drugs within 30 days of planned administration of trial medication that might&#xD;
             reasonably influence the results of the trial (including drugs that cause QT/QTc&#xD;
             interval prolongation)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intake of an investigational drug in another clinical trial within 60 days of planned&#xD;
             administration of investigational drug in the current trial, or concurrent&#xD;
             participation in another clinical trial in which investigational drug is administered&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Smoker (unless the subject quit smoking for at least 3 months prior to first planned&#xD;
             administration of trial medication)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Drug abuse or positive drug screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood donation of more than 100 mL within 30 days of planned administration of trial&#xD;
             medication or intended blood donation during the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intention to perform excessive physical activities within one week prior to the&#xD;
             administration of trial medication or during the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to comply with the dietary regimen of the trial site&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (such as QTc intervals that are&#xD;
             repeatedly greater than 450 ms) or any other relevant Electrocardiogram (ECG) finding&#xD;
             at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of additional risk factors for Torsade de Pointes (such as heart failure,&#xD;
             hypokalaemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator, for instance,&#xD;
             because the subject is not considered able to understand and comply with study&#xD;
             requirements, or has a condition that would not allow safe participation in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition, the following trial-specific exclusion criteria apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of relevant neurological disorder affecting the peripheral or central nervous&#xD;
             system (this includes, but is not limited to: stroke, epilepsy, inflammatory or&#xD;
             atrophic diseases affecting the nervous system, cluster headache or any cancer of the&#xD;
             nervous system). Febrile seizures in childhood or adolescence, recovered carpal tunnel&#xD;
             syndrome, recovered uncomplicated meningitis, recovered herpes zoster, tension&#xD;
             headache, occasional benign tics (e.g. due to stress) or minor par- or dysesthesia&#xD;
             (e.g. as a side effect of prior blood withdrawal) do not constitute a history of&#xD;
             relevant neurological disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of immunological disease except allergy not relevant to the trial (such as&#xD;
             mild hay fever or dust mite allergy) and except asthma in childhood or adolescence&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of cancer (other than successfully treated basal cell carcinoma)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects with WOCBP partner who are unwilling to use male contraception (condom&#xD;
             or sexual abstinence) from time point of first administration of trial medication&#xD;
             until 30 days after the last administration of trial medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Further exclusion criteria apply&#xD;
