  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Good nutritional status of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with better&#xD;
      outcome of the disease. The prevalence of malnutrition in patients with Crohn's disease&#xD;
      varies and is higher in patients with active disease. Available studies in the literature&#xD;
      have assessed the nutritional status of patients with Crohn's disease. However, sample size&#xD;
      of available studies is small and highly heterogeneous, and most patients are hospitalized&#xD;
      with active disease. The aim of the present study is a thorough assessment of nutritional&#xD;
      status of 220 patients either with active Crohn's disease or in remission of the disease&#xD;
      using multiple widely available tools and methods, in order to assess their accuracy and&#xD;
      estimate the prevalence of multiple malnutrition phenotypes such as undernutrition,&#xD;
      sarcopenia, sarcopenic obesity and cachexia. Finally, the effect of the nutritional status on&#xD;
      the course of the disease will be investigated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study sample will comprise of 220 adults with proven Crohn's disease, either with active&#xD;
      disease or in remission phase. A detailed medical and nutritional assessment will be&#xD;
      implemented at baseline. Data regarding the hospitalizations, disease relapse, duration of&#xD;
      remission and complications of all the patients will be collected one year after the baseline&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More specifically regarding the detailed assessment, firstly, gastroenterologists of the&#xD;
      research team will complete a full medical record regarding the localization of the disease,&#xD;
      activity of disease (active or remission), complications, comorbidities and medication. The&#xD;
      activity of Crohn's disease will be assessed using the Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI). Blood&#xD;
      will be collected for all patients with Crohn's Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, in the Laboratory of Clinical Nutrition &amp; Dietetics at Harokopio University,&#xD;
      patients will participate in the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Indirect calorimetry: Resting Energy Expenditure (REE) measurement will be performed&#xD;
           (Ultima Series, Cosmed).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthropometry: Weight, height, waist and mid-arm circumference, and triceps skinfold&#xD;
           will be measured. Body mass index, mid-arm muscle circumference and area will be&#xD;
           estimated using standard equations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body composition analysis and bone density measurement: Total body Dual-energy X-Ray&#xD;
           Absorptiometry (DXA) and Spine (Lunar DPX-MD, Madison, WI, USA) will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Muscle strength and performance status: Handgrip strength measurement based on certain&#xD;
           protocol and the &quot;Short Physical Performance Battery&quot; (SPPB) tool will be implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dietary intake evaluation: A Food-Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) and two non-consecutive&#xD;
           24h recalls (one weekday and one weekend day) will be recorded. Data will be analyzed to&#xD;
           estimate energy, macro- and micronutrients intake (Nutritionist Pro software, 2.2&#xD;
           version). Food group intake and meal patterns will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical activity assessment: Patients' physical activity levels will be assessed using&#xD;
           the &quot;Harokopio Physical Activity Questionnaire&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fatigue and Quality of Life Assessment: Assessment of fatigue will be performed with&#xD;
           &quot;Fatigue Severity Scale&quot; (FSS), when assessment of quality of life with be performed&#xD;
           with &quot;Food Related Quality of Life&quot; (FR-QoL) and &quot;Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease&#xD;
           Questionnaire&quot; (SIBDQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, patients' nutritional risk or nutritional status will be assessed through&#xD;
      several previously validated tools like the Subjective Global Assessment, the Nutrition Risk&#xD;
      Score 2002, the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool, the efficacy of which will be tested&#xD;
      in the present study. Patients will be also categorized according to ESPEN's (European&#xD;
      Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition) recent malnutrition diagnostic criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The full assessment will be repeated only for patients who will change medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three months, six months, nine months and twelve months after the baseline assessment of the&#xD;
      study samples, data will be collected regarding the hospitalizations, disease relapse,&#xD;
      duration of remission and complications of all the patients.&#xD;
