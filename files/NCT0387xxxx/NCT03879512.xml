  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trials evaluates the feasibility, safety and efficacy of an individualized&#xD;
      cancer vaccine, based on autologous, tumor-lysate loaded dendritic cells in children and&#xD;
      adolescents with relapsed high-grade gliomas. In addition, regulatory T cells are depleted by&#xD;
      a short cycle of metronomic cyclophosphamide upfront of the vaccine in order to facilitate&#xD;
      induction of immune responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic DC vaccines are followed by four cycles of Nivo/Ipi double checkpoint blockade&#xD;
      and a Nivolumab monotherapy maintenance in order to optimize the induced T-cell response.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Relapsed high-grade gliomas (in the following addressed as high-grade gliomas = HGG) in&#xD;
      children and adolescents represent a very bad prognosis group for which a recommended&#xD;
      standard salvage therapy is currently not available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combination of Dendritic Cell (DC) vaccination, metronomic cyclophosphamide, and checkpoint&#xD;
      blockade will be investigated in the present trial as a new treatment strategy for these&#xD;
      patients: metronomic cyclophosphamide has been shown to significantly reduce numbers of&#xD;
      regulatory T cells (Treg) without inducing general leukopenia. DCs might induce&#xD;
      tumour-directed immune responses thereby facilitating long-term remissions. Efficacy of&#xD;
      primed T-cell responses by the vaccine will potentially be enhanced by the application of&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitors Nivolumab (antiPD-L1) and Ipilimumab (antiCTLA4) in the post-vaccine&#xD;
      phase and during maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide is an established drug used as an anti-cancer or immunosuppressive substance&#xD;
      since decades, with extensive experience when used in low, non-myeloablative dosages. DCs&#xD;
      represent an innovative new strategy in cellular immunotherapy. DCs in cancer patients have&#xD;
      been used in a number of smaller studies, and in some of these trials, promising results&#xD;
      could be obtained. Several studies showed a trend towards a prolonged overall survival with a&#xD;
      few long-term survivors which is otherwise extremely rare in this high-risk population.&#xD;
      Results seemed to be more favourable in pediatric than in adult patients. Checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitors (antiPD-L1 and/or antiCTLA4) have been shown to exhibit synergistic effects with&#xD;
      vaccines in preclinical models, and prelimnary data of several early stage trials have shown&#xD;
      promising results. Therefore, our study aims to improve the efficacy of a DC-based&#xD;
      therapeutic vaccine by optimizing the conditions upfront of the vaccine (Treg depletion) and&#xD;
      improving T-cell responses by checkpoint blockade after the vaccine in the effector phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, this study will exploit the optimal efficacy of a therapeutic vaccine in&#xD;
      children and adolescents with relapsed HGG.&#xD;
