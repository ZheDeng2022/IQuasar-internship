  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Florida has the fifth largest transgender population in the United States. Transgender women,&#xD;
      particularly those of color, in the southern part of Florida are a marginalized population&#xD;
      who are impacted by co-morbidities of substance abuse and HIV in their communities. The&#xD;
      overall objective of the study is to use a vetted adapted brief intervention to stem the&#xD;
      development of substance abuse in at-risk transgender women, and thereby increase primary and&#xD;
      secondary prevention methods such as routine HIV screening, uptake of pre-exposure&#xD;
      prophylaxis (PrEP) and use of non-occupational post-exposure prophylaxis (nPEP).&#xD;

      Background: Transgender women are disproportionally affected by substance abuse and HIV.&#xD;
      Evidence-based interventions that can address both issues simultaneously may efficiently&#xD;
      improve the overall health of transgender women and reduce burdensome health and societal&#xD;
      costs associated with substance abuse and HIV. In South Florida, the majority of transgender&#xD;
      women identify as Black or Latina, or transgender women of color (TWOC). TWOC are at highest&#xD;
      risk for substance abuse and HIV acquisition, due to multiple external stressors arising as a&#xD;
      consequence of being a gender minority, and also a racial/ethnic minority. Studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) to be effective&#xD;
      in mitigating development of substance use disorders (SUD) in other at-risk, marginalized&#xD;
      populations. An adapted culturally-tailored SBIRT focused on linkage to substance use&#xD;
      services and HIV pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP and nPEP) may effectively reduce&#xD;
      the odds of individuals in this special population developing a SUD and also facilitate their&#xD;
      voluntary election of HIV screening and use of PrEP/nPEP for HIV prevention. Objectives: K99&#xD;
      -In preparation for the independent phase, the career development phase will include training&#xD;
      in qualitative research methods and intervention development. R00 - In the independent phase,&#xD;
      the study objectives will be to (a) use a mixed-methods approach to obtain formative data&#xD;
      among 40 transgender women that will aid in adapting and developing an adapted culturally&#xD;
      tailored SBIRT intervention (SBIRT-A), (b) pre-test and refine SBIRT-A in 15 transgender&#xD;
      women based on formative work and, (c) pilot test SBIRT-A in a sample of 76 transgender to&#xD;
      assess feasibility and acceptability. Pilot Design: Randomized trial among 76 adult (18 years&#xD;
      or older) HIV uninfected transgender women at moderate risk for developing a substance use&#xD;
      disorder who will be randomized to either SBIRT-A or the control condition (INFO-C). The&#xD;
      INFO-C group will be a time-matched comparison control where information will be provided on&#xD;
      substance use and PrEP services in a non-SBIRT format via printed and audio-visual study&#xD;
      material. There will be a follow-up visit in three months to assess linkage, and barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators to substance use services and PrEP/nPEP. Analysis: Bivariate difference tests&#xD;
      (chi square and t-tests) will be used to test differences between SBIRT-A and INFO-C&#xD;
      participants for the primary outcome measures (linkage to substance use services, PrEP, and&#xD;
      nPEP) at the three-month visit. Multivariate binary logistic regressions (post- and&#xD;
      pre-intervention) will be used to determine substance use as a predictor of (1) HIV/STI&#xD;
      screening in the past three months and (2&amp;3) PrEP and nPEP uptake in the past three months.&#xD;
      Significance: Results derived from this study will help elucidate the relationship between&#xD;
      substance use and HIV among transgender women, including TWOC, in South Florida, and will&#xD;
      provide evidence for a larger study that can test the efficacy of SBIRT-A to reduce&#xD;
      prevalence of substance abuse and HIV in this special population. The aims of this study are&#xD;
      parallel to the NIH/National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) strategic plan to decrease&#xD;
      HIV/AIDS health disparities, prevent HIV transmission, and better understand the interaction&#xD;
      of drug abuse and HIV/AIDS.&#xD;
