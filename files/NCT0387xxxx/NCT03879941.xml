    <textblock>
      The thumb accounts for 50% of the total hand function. This study reports the functional&#xD;
      outcomes and complications of people with traumatic thumb amputations who underwent&#xD;
      toe-to-thumb reconstruction.From 2013-01 to 2018-01, 29 patients with second-degree thumb&#xD;
      defect underwent thumb reconstruction with distal phalangeal braided toenail flap. The&#xD;
      footscan foot pressure gait analysis system was used to measure the index changes of the same&#xD;
      foot before and after one, three and six months. The contact area, peak pressure, impulse&#xD;
      value, contact time of each gait phase, centre of gravity coordinate and foot balance were&#xD;
      analysed statistically. Twenty-nine cases of thumb reconstruction recovered well. After&#xD;
      following up for 6-15 months, the appearance of the reconstructed thumb was close to normal,&#xD;
      and the sensation was restored to S3+. The two-point discrimination was 6-8 mm, and the&#xD;
      function of the thumb was good. The function of the donor foot was well restored, and no skin&#xD;
      ulceration, pain and claudication were noted during walking. Compared with that before&#xD;
      operation, the biomechanical indices of the donor foot were basically restored to normal six&#xD;
      months after operation. Only the stress and impulse values of the third metatarsal head were&#xD;
      significantly increased, forming a stress concentration area centred on the third metatarsal&#xD;
      head.This study confirmed that the toe nail flap with distal phalangeal bone restored the&#xD;
      second-degree thumb defect without destroying the main functional structure of the sole. The&#xD;
      biomechanical indices of the donor foot were basically restored to normal six months after&#xD;
      operation. Only the stress concentration area centred on the third metatarsal head, and the&#xD;
      pain on the forefoot was induced after the operation. Discomfort, callus formation,&#xD;
      metatarsal fasciitis, etc. can lead to fatigue fracture of the third metatarsal bone in&#xD;
      severe cases, which requires further follow-up and observation.&#xD;

    <description>According to the anatomical region, the plantar was divided into eight stress regions.The increase or decrease of contact area reflects the stress distribution of sole after operation.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Peak pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Six months</time_frame>
    <description>Its increase indicates that the pressure in the unit area increases when the sole touches the ground.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Impulse value</measure>
    <time_frame>Six months</time_frame>
    <description>Impulse value refers to the product of touchdown time and pressure in each stress area of the foot in each cycle. The increase of impulse is more suggestive of fatigue damage and subsequent foot deformities.</description>

        The causes of injury were as follows: 2 cases of amputation and loss, 21 cases of machine&#xD;
        rolling damage, 5 cases of rotational tear and replantation failure and 1 case of childhood&#xD;
        traumatic defect. The patients included 19 males and 10 females with age of 17-46 years&#xD;
        (mean 29.1 years), height of 156-179 cm (average 170.4 cm), weight of 50-80 kg (average&#xD;
        62.3 kg) and foot length of 23-26 cm (average 24.5 cm). The defect cases included 12 on the&#xD;
        left side of the toe and 17 on the right side.&#xD;
