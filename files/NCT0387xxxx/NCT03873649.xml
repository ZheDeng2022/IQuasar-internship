  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is an inflammatory lung disease that is caused by exposure&#xD;
      of susceptible individuals to organic materials in the environment. It is also known by&#xD;
      various names depending on the exposure and some of these names include farmer's lung, pigeon&#xD;
      breeder's lung, hot tub lung to name a few. HP can cause lung scarring that impairs breathing&#xD;
      and oxygenation. Early detection and avoidance of triggers can stop and reverse the disease&#xD;
      but a significant number of patients continue to have active disease requiring treatment in&#xD;
      spite of avoiding the trigger. The current choice of therapies is based on clinical&#xD;
      experience and not on rigorous clinical trials. Not fully understanding the type of&#xD;
      inflammation that is seen in HP and the cells involved in this inflammatory response limits&#xD;
      health care providers' ability to choose drugs to study in HP that can stop the inflammation&#xD;
      and limit scar formation. The goal of the investigators' study is to better understand the&#xD;
      type of cells that are involved in the inflammatory response in the lungs of HP patients and&#xD;
      what drives these cells to be active. By better understanding the type of cells and what&#xD;
      drives them, health care providers can begin to choose and study drugs that can limit the&#xD;
      inflammation and subsequent scarring. The investigators' will recruit HP patients and with&#xD;
      their consent perform a scope of the lungs (bronchoscopy) with a limited lung wash to get the&#xD;
      inflamed cells out of the lungs to further study them in the lab. The investigators' study&#xD;
      will provide us with preliminary results to guide us in performing a more detailed study in&#xD;
      the future to better understand the disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is a granulomatous lung disorder triggered by exposure to&#xD;
      one of a multitude of organic antigens. Incidence rates of HP vary by geography, season and&#xD;
      population studied but it is estimated to be the third most common interstitial lung disease&#xD;
      with an estimated prevalence rate in the USA of 420-3000/100,0002. HP accounts for at least&#xD;
      7.5% of ILD related lung transplant. Exposure to an antigen in a susceptible host induces an&#xD;
      inflammatory response with the subsequent formation of poorly formed granulomas that impact&#xD;
      gas exchange which clinically manifests as shortness of breath, hypoxia and radiographic&#xD;
      changes. HP can present acutely, subacutely or chronically depending on the duration of&#xD;
      symptoms and radiographic changes. Radiographic manifestations of HP include ground-glass&#xD;
      changes, centrilobular nodules, air trapping known as mosaic pattern, fibrosis, emphysema, or&#xD;
      more frequently a combination of these. The cornerstone of management is identification and&#xD;
      avoidance of the inciting agent which is effective if accomplished early in the disease&#xD;
      process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although detection and avoidance of possible triggers can attenuate or reverse the disease, a&#xD;
      significant number of patients continue to have active and/or progressive disease requiring&#xD;
      chronic immunosuppressive therapy. Standard of care for IS therapy is corticosteroids and&#xD;
      azathioprine but this is based on clinical experience and not based on randomized clinical&#xD;
      trials(ref). The efficacy of this regimen is not known and patients develop persistent or&#xD;
      progressive disease in spite of aggressive therapy leading to end stage lung disease&#xD;
      necessitating lung transplantation or ending with death. To date, there are no randomized&#xD;
      trials for immunosuppressive therapies and no reports of the use of biological agents in HP.&#xD;
      The lack of studies is partially due to the lack of a thorough understanding of the immune&#xD;
      response in HP especially in patient based studies that focus at the site of disease&#xD;
      activity, the lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immunological response and pathways leading to this response have not been fully&#xD;
      investigated especially in humans. The Th17 pathway has been implicated in disease&#xD;
      pathogenesis and T-regulatory cell dysfunction has been described although studies in humans&#xD;
      are limited. Recent work in sarcoidosis, a granulomatous lung disease, has shown that Th17.1&#xD;
      cells play a potential important role in granuloma immunopathogenesis. Through an R01&#xD;
      mechanism, the investigators are currently investigating the role of T-cell skewing and&#xD;
      associated gene expression in sarcoidosis that is associated with progressive disease vs&#xD;
      stable disease and the investigators are investigating its impact on disease course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This gap in knowledge in HP has limited the choice and study of immunomodulatory agents in HP&#xD;
      and especially biological agents in the treatment of persistent and progressive disease. To&#xD;
      narrow this knowledge gap, the investigators propose conducting a study to investigate the&#xD;
      lung CD4+ T-cell immunophenotype and CD4+ T-cell gene expression in HP to enhance the&#xD;
      investigators' understanding of the immune response in HP and the pathways involved in the&#xD;
      immune response which would enable the investigators to further pursue guided therapeutic&#xD;
      trials in subacute and chronic HP.&#xD;
