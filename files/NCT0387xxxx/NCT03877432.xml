  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will test S2-S4 dermatome stimulation with spinal cord injury (SCI) individuals&#xD;
      using intermittent catheterization to estimate the clinical impact on bladder capacity and&#xD;
      continence. For individuals with SCI using intermittent catheterization, investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that dermatome stimulation will decrease bladder spasm frequency and intensity,&#xD;
      and reduce bladder incontinence chronically. The goal of this study is to provide objective&#xD;
      evidence for the assertion that dermatome stimulation chronically decreases bladder activity&#xD;
      and therefore the unwanted side effects of neurogenic bladder. This project will improve the&#xD;
      understanding of the neurophysiology of afferent-mediated neural pathways that affect bladder&#xD;
      function, and translate recent advances discovered in animal and human studies into clinical&#xD;
      research and treatment. The ability to void safely and effectively by electrical stimulation&#xD;
      without cutting sacral nerves or the external urethral sphincter would be a major advance. A&#xD;
      socially acceptable, predictable and reliable device for reducing incontinence would be&#xD;
      widely used and improve quality of life.&#xD;

      Investigators will test S2-S4 dermatome stimulation with SCI individuals using intermittent&#xD;
      catheterization to estimate the clinical impact on bladder capacity and continence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For individuals with SCI using intermittent catheterization, investigators will verify that&#xD;
      S2-S4 dermatome stimulation is acutely effective at reducing hyper-reflexive bladder activity&#xD;
      during bladder filling. Investigators hypothesize that S2-S4 dermatome stimulation will&#xD;
      reduce the number and severity of incontinent episodes, increase bladder capacity, and&#xD;
      increase the volume catheterized. By comparing the extended outcomes to the acute laboratory&#xD;
      outcomes obtained by ourselves and others, investigators can assess the feasibility of acute&#xD;
      urodynamics to identify subjects for implanted devices or future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For individuals with SCI using intermittent catheterization, investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      dermatome stimulation will decrease bladder spasm frequency and intensity, and reduce bladder&#xD;
      incontinence chronically. The goal of this study is to provide objective evidence for the&#xD;
      assertion that dermatome stimulation decreases bladder activity and therefore the unwanted&#xD;
      side effects of neurogenic bladder. These experiments will demonstrate the neurophysiologic&#xD;
      response of acute stimulation through urodynamic test, and will also provide increased&#xD;
      evidence for future clinical trials through proof of lessened bladder pressures - an&#xD;
      important cause of vesico-ureteral reflux and renal injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a potentially larger population of persons with incomplete SCI than complete SCI who&#xD;
      retain sensation in the pelvis who could gain benefit from dermatome stimulation. To examine&#xD;
      the outcomes following incomplete SCI (in persons who retain sensation in the pelvis),&#xD;
      investigators will test dermatome stimulation to determine the tolerable and effective&#xD;
      electrical stimulation parameters in persons that have some degree of preserved motor or&#xD;
      sensory function through the lowest sacral spinal cord segments. Investigators will acutely&#xD;
      measure the effects of dermatome stimulation on bladder pressure and hyper-reflexic bladder&#xD;
      contractions during bladder filling. Investigators hypothesize that dermatome stimulation&#xD;
      will increase bladder capacity at stimulus amplitudes that are acutely tolerable to subjects&#xD;
      with incomplete SCI. It will determine the feasibility of a non-invasive screening procedure&#xD;
      to identify potential candidates for future device implantation, thereby providing a pathway&#xD;
      for translation of the technology to implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will improve the understanding of the neurophysiology of afferent-mediated&#xD;
      neural pathways that affect bladder function, and translate recent advances discovered in&#xD;
      animal and human studies into clinical research and treatment. The ability to void safely and&#xD;
      effectively by electrical stimulation without cutting sacral nerves or the external urethral&#xD;
      sphincter would be a major advance. A socially acceptable, predictable and reliable device&#xD;

A total of 8 serial cystometrograms will be performed: 2 control fills, followed by 4 fills with stimulation, followed by 2 control fills. The minimum (or threshold) stimulation amplitude (T) necessary to elicit the genito-anal reflex was first determined for each subject. Subsequently, each subject received a randomized sequence of cystometric fill trials with and without continuous dermatome stimulation. The dermatome stimulation was randomly stimulated at stimulation amplitudes of 1, 2, 3, and 4 T.</description>

          <description>Check the effect of improving the function of bladder storage and bladder capacity before and after dermatome stimulation.&#xD;
Dermatome stimulation: Dermatome (S2-S4) stimulation is aimed at improving the function of bladder storage and bladder capacity. A total of 8 serial cystometrograms will be performed: 2 control fills, followed by 4 fills with stimulation, followed by 2 control fills. The minimum (or threshold) stimulation amplitude (T) necessary to elicit the genito-anal reflex was first determined for each subject. Subsequently, each subject received a randomized sequence of cystometric fill trials with and without continuous dermatome stimulation. The dermatome stimulation was randomly stimulated at stimulation amplitudes of 1, 2, 3, and 4 T.</description>
