    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open label, phase I/II, dose-escalation study, involving a single&#xD;
      injection of Temferon, an investigational advanced therapy consisting of autologous&#xD;
      CD34+-enriched hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells exposed to transduction with a&#xD;
      lentiviral vector driving myeloid-specific interferon-ɑ2 expression, which will be&#xD;
      administered to up to 9 patients affected by multiple myeloma in early relapse after&#xD;
      intensive front line treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open label, single center, phase I/II, therapeutic exploratory,&#xD;
      dose-escalation, prospective study, involving a single intravenous infusion of Temferon, an&#xD;
      investigational advanced therapy consisting of autologous CD34+-enriched hematopoietic stem&#xD;
      and progenitor cells (HSPCs) exposed to transduction with a third-generation, vesicular&#xD;
      stomatitis virus-G (VSV-G) pseudo-typed lentiviral vector driving myeloid-specific&#xD;
      interferon-ɑ2 (IFN-ɑ2) expression, which will be administered to up to 9 patients affected by&#xD;
      multiple myeloma in early relapse after intensive front line treatment. The study will&#xD;
      recruit, treat and follow-up patients at a specialist hematology and bone marrow&#xD;
      transplantation unit at Ospedale San Raffaele (OSR) in Milan, Italy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enrol multiple myeloma patients that have experienced an early relapse after&#xD;
      intensive front line treatment, have been treated with an approved second line combination&#xD;
      treatment regimen and obtained at least a very good partial remission (VGPR) according to&#xD;
      International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria. Once the written informed consent is&#xD;
      obtained, and screening procedures have been completed, harvesting of HSPCs will occur.&#xD;
      Patients will be offered maintenance treatment during Temferon production and release. Upon&#xD;
      Temferon release for clinical use, patients will be admitted to the transplantation unit for&#xD;
      receipt of a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen consisting of melphalan. This will be&#xD;
      followed by autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) and administration of Temferon. In-patient&#xD;
      monitoring will occur until hematological recovery occurs. Thereafter, regular follow-up of&#xD;
      patients will occur up to 2 years (+730 days). At the +730 day visit, patients will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in a long term follow-up study which will last for an additional 6&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 cohorts of 3 patients will receive escalating doses of Temferon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that MM disease progression occurs, patients will be managed according to best&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;

    <description>Autologous CD34+-enriched hematopoietic progenitor cells exposed ex vivo to a specific lentiviral vector encoding for the human IFN-ɑ2 gene.&#xD;
Its expression is tightly controlled by the human TIE2 enhancer/promoter sequence and by a post-transcriptional regulation layer represented by target miRNA sequences. This enables suppression of IFN-ɑ2 expression in HSPCs, thereby further increasing the specificity of the delivery strategy for their Tie2 expressing myeloid cell progeny.</description>
