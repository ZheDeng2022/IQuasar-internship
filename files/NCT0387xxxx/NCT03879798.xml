The study population for Phase I dose-escalation will include only patients who complete at least 1 full cycle of treatment (including the initial 7-day safety run-in and the complete 21-days of Cycle 1); only these patients will be considered evaluable for DLT and determination of the MTD.</description>

    <description>The first part of this study is a phase I trial to assess the safety and tolerability of DS-3201b in combination with fixed-dose irinotecan. The second part of this study will be an open label, single-arm phase II study of DS-3201b at the established recommended phase II dose (RP2D) in combination with fixed-dose irinotecan. Dose-Escalation, which enrolled a total of 12 patients at MSK, is completed. Phase 1 of this study determined that the highest and safest dose of DS-3201b in patients was 100 mg daily.</description>

                  contraception.&#xD;
