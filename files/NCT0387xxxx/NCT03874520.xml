      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medical helpline 1813 in Copenhagen, Denmark handles telephone calls regarding&#xD;
      non-life-threatening medical emergencies. Next to 200,000 calls/year concern children and&#xD;
      afterwards about 30% are referred to a pediatric urgent care center. However, most of these&#xD;
      children have very mild symptoms, which do neither require treatment nor any tests, but&#xD;
      merely parental medical guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial assessment; triage, of children on the telephone is difficult, especially when the&#xD;
      operator does not know the child or the parents, and when it is difficult to describe the&#xD;
      symptoms in medical terms. This may result in both too many not-so-sick children getting&#xD;
      unnecessarily referred to hospitals, and perhaps also too few more severely sick children&#xD;
      sent to the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will study if triage of children by videocalls (video triage) provide greater&#xD;
      security for parents and health care personnel in the decision that more children can stay at&#xD;
      home after medical guidance, thus causing at least 10% fewer visits to a pediatric urgent&#xD;
      care center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the investigators will study if video triage identifies more children with the&#xD;
      need of urgent admission to a Department of Pediatrics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children aged 6 months to 5 years with symptoms from the respiratory tract will be triaged by&#xD;
      either video or telephone by an operator every other day, in order to compare the results&#xD;
      between these two similar groups. In cases of video triage, the parent will receive a text&#xD;
      message to their smartphone with a video link.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of video triage will be assessed by reviewing the hospital case reports of all&#xD;
      patients for contact within the 48 hours after the 1813 call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Video assessment at call centers may &quot;give eyes to the operators&quot; and revolutionize telephone&#xD;
      triage. The study may result in fewer children referred to hospitals, more appropriate use of&#xD;
      resources and better experiences for the families.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each year the Copenhagen Emergency Services receives approximately 190,000 calls to the&#xD;
      medical helpline 1813 regarding sick children younger than 12 years (injuries excluded)&#xD;
      (Rasmussen MV, ref. 1). These children are not so sick that the parents call the emergency&#xD;
      helpline 112, but the parents need to contact the health care system outside their general&#xD;
      practitioners' (GP) opening hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After contact with the parents the medical helpline 1813's health professionals have several&#xD;
      possibilities for the children; e.g. admitting the children to a Department of Pediatrics,&#xD;
      referring them to assessment in Børnelægevagten (a pediatric urgent care center), guiding&#xD;
      them to self-care at home, or referring them to their GP the next workday.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of the 190,000 calls annually regarding sick children, the majority of the calls concerns&#xD;
      small children; in 2018, about 175,000 of the calls concerned children younger than 6 years.&#xD;
      About 30% of these children were referred to assessment in a pediatric urgent care center.&#xD;
      Most of these patients have mild symptoms which do neither require treatment nor paraclinical&#xD;
      testing, but merely parental medical guidance. These consultations can be experienced as&#xD;
      unnecessary and inappropriate for the sick child and its parents. Moreover, the visits are&#xD;
      expensive for the health system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone triage is difficult, especially when the operator does not know the child or the&#xD;
      parents, and when it is difficult to describe symptoms in medical terms. Telemedicine, i.e.&#xD;
      the use of communication- and information technology within the healthcare system, is gaining&#xD;
      increasing influence in the medical society, also within pediatrics (Olson CA et al, ref. 2).&#xD;
      The American Academy of Pediatrics has urged both general pediatricians and pediatric&#xD;
      subspecialists to use telemedicine to serve more children (Marcin JP et al, ref. 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two studies both found good agreement between face-to-face and video-assisted assessment of&#xD;
      children with respiratory symptoms (Siew L et al, Gattu R et al, ref. 4, 5). Another study&#xD;
      about children with acute worsening of asthma, reported that the parents felt safer when the&#xD;
      triage of the child was done by a health professional who could watch the child on video, and&#xD;
      the health professionals also felt safer with the video triage (Freeman B et al, ref. 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does triage of children by videocalls (video triage) provide greater security for parents and&#xD;
      health care personnel in the decision that more children can stay at home after medical&#xD;
      guidance, thus causing at least 10% fewer visits to Børnelægevagten (a pediatric urgent care&#xD;
      center)? Furthermore, doses triage of children by videocalls (video triage) identify more&#xD;
      children with the need of urgent admission to a Department of Pediatrics?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will investigate the safety of video triage, by subsequently reading in the&#xD;
      children's hospital case reports and study if the children have been examined at a pediatric&#xD;
      department within the first 48 hours after the 1813 call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also examine the parents' and the operators' experience with the video&#xD;
      call, regarding feelings of safety and the technical quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project thus aims to evaluate the value of improving triage with the new technology,&#xD;
      video calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, there are no other studies of the effect of video calls in the initial&#xD;
      triage of children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and structure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is a prospective quality improvement study investigating the results of a new&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, a smaller group of nurses is trained in video triage. They will offer video triage&#xD;
      every other work day, i.e. one-day video triage and the next day ordinary telephone triage,&#xD;
      etc. Consequently, the operators are always the same, and the only difference between the&#xD;
      groups will be if video triage is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the project period, more nurses will be trained in video triage. There will thus be a&#xD;
      step-by-step inclusion of nurses who carry out video triage. The project thereby has the&#xD;
      character of a stepped wedge randomized trial (Hemming K et al, ref. 7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results from video triage days will be compared with results from non-video triage days.&#xD;
      The control group will thus be the patients from non-video triage days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method of video triage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially 20 operators, all nurses, will be trained in video triage. During the project&#xD;
      period, on video days, the operators will offer video triage to children aged 6 months up to&#xD;
      and including 5 years, with respiratory symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parents will receive a text message with a link on their smartphone, which upon&#xD;
      activation starts a video call with the operator at 1813.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operators will use the medical history as well as the video, i.e. both video and audio,&#xD;
      to make a plan for the child together with the parent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after the call, the parents will receive a text message with a link to an&#xD;
      electronic questionnaire regarding their experience with the call and the assessment of their&#xD;
      child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the call, the operators at 1813 will also answer an electronic questionnaire, about the&#xD;
      experience regarding the call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On non-video days, the operators will enroll corresponding children to telephone triage.&#xD;
      Similarly, these children's parents will receive a text message about their experience with&#xD;
      the call, and the nurses will also fill out a questionnaire after these calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 2 to 8 workdays after the call the project group will read the child's hospital case&#xD;
      report, to investigate if the child has been at a hospital within 8 hours or 48 hours after&#xD;
      the call to 1813. If the child has been at a hospital, there will be noted for example date,&#xD;
      time and diagnosis, and if the child was admitted to an intensive care unit, or in the worst&#xD;
      case, got lasting injuries or died.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data department at the Copenhagen Emergency Services will daily extract data on the&#xD;
      children enrolled in the project from a patient treatment database at the Copenhagen&#xD;
      Emergency Services, which was established with the approval of the regional information&#xD;
      security department. The data sheet will include data on the patient and the call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2018 there were 177,000 calls regarding children up to and including 5 years. Of the&#xD;
      177,000 calls, 9% were referred directly to admission at a department of Pediatrics, 30% were&#xD;
      referred to assessment at pediatric urgent care center, 31% were guided in self-care, 25%&#xD;
      were advised to call their GPs the next workday and 5% were referred to other options. That&#xD;
      is, 56% stayed at home the day the parents called 1813.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that video triage can result in at least 10% more parents&#xD;
      staying at home with the child on the day they call 1813, i.e. an increase from 56% to 66%.&#xD;
      With a power of 80% and two-sided significance of 95%, a total of 774 children distributed on&#xD;
      two equal sized groups of 387 patients should be included according to openepi&#xD;
      (http://openepi.com/SampleSize/SSCohort.htm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If, on the other hand, video triage results in 15% more parents staying at home with the&#xD;
      child the day they call 1813, i.e. an increase from 56% to 71%, it is only necessary to&#xD;
      include 346 children in total to identify such a difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast, if video triage results in 7% more parents staying at home with the child at the&#xD;
      day, they call 1813, i.e. an increase from 56% to 63% 1582 children divided into two groups&#xD;
      must be included, and if video triage only results in 5% more parents staying at home with&#xD;
      the child at the day of the call to 1813, i.e. an increase from 56% to 61% 3102 children&#xD;
      divided into two groups must be included. In all cases in according to openepi&#xD;
      (http://openepi.com/SampleSize/SSCohort.htm) with a power of 80% and two-sided significance&#xD;
      of 95%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-parametric statistics, two-sided and with significance at p-value &lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first 200 video calls, an interim analysis to study the effect of the video triage&#xD;
      will be performed, including the period of time it has taken to enroll these children, as&#xD;
      well as how the video triage technically has worked, in order to be able to correct possible&#xD;
      problems. The safety will also be reviewed, in order to make sure that the children assessed&#xD;
      on video do not have higher admittance rate and/or mortality rate, as a sign that they arrive&#xD;
      too late to the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first 400 first calls, another interim analysis to study the effect of video calls&#xD;
      will be made. This will also include a study of whether there is a significant difference&#xD;
      between the number of children staying at home the day the parents call 1813 using video&#xD;
      triage and using common telephone triage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If no significant difference is revealed the study will go on and the effect of video triage&#xD;
      will be evaluated when 774 patients has been enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a significant effect is still not revealed between the patients using video triage and&#xD;
      using common telephone triage the project will go on until 1600 patients have been included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If no significant difference is revealed the study will go on and the effect of video triage&#xD;
      will be evaluated when 3500 patients has been enrolled. However, the study will not go on&#xD;
      more than 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives and possible yield&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of this initial project, the project group expect to know if use of video triage&#xD;
      can increase the number of children who safely can stay at home the day their parents call&#xD;
      1813, i.e. the children are referred to self-care or to their GP. This may be beneficial for&#xD;
      the sick child and its parents and there may be a socio-economic win. It will also be known&#xD;
      if children with more severe symptoms more often are referred directly to a Department of&#xD;
      Pediatrics, rather than to an initial assessment in a pediatric urgent care center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the study of the video triage, the management at the Emergency Services Copenhagen can&#xD;
      decide if video triage will be an integrated option at the medical helpline 1813.&#xD;
