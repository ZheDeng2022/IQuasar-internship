  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking causes cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, cancers and diabetes, and it has been&#xD;
      a leading risk factor for death globally. Despite the availability of smoking cessation&#xD;
      services locally, most smokers do not use such services. Workplace is one of the most&#xD;
      convenient platforms to provide smoking cessation services and over 55% of smokers are&#xD;
      employed according to the local population-based survey. However, the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      smoking cessation programme conducted in workplace is yet to be examined in Hong Kong, and&#xD;
      the attitudes and practices of corporations in promoting smoking cessation are not clear.&#xD;
      Thus, this study aims to examine the employers'/ managerial staff's knowledge, attitudes and&#xD;
      practices in promoting smoking cessation in workplace and evaluate the smoking behaviors of&#xD;
      participants before and after attending a smoking cessation intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will separate into two phases. Phase I is a large scale cross-sectional survey to&#xD;
      corporations in Hong Kong to examine the employers' knowledge, attitudes and practices in&#xD;
      promoting smoking cessation in the workplace. Phase II is a 2-arm randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      will be conducted to examine the effectiveness of WhatsApp intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of the study is to measure participated smokers' self reported 7-day&#xD;
      point prevalence quit rate at 6-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes include participated&#xD;
      smokers' (i) self reported 7-day point prevalence quit rate at 9- and 12-month follow-ups;&#xD;
      (ii) self-reported reduction rate at 6-, 9- and 12-month follow-ups; (iii) self-reported quit&#xD;
      attempt at 6-, 9- and 12-month follow-ups; (iv) change in self-efficacy towards smoking&#xD;
      cessation at 6-, 9- and 12-month follow-ups compared with baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to measure the (1) basic information of the corporations,&#xD;
      including the total number of employees and smoking employees; (2) knowledge on smoking of&#xD;
      employers/managerial staff; (3) attitudes on smoking cessation of employers/managerial staff;&#xD;
      (4) practices of the corporations with respect to smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics such as frequency, percentage, and mean will be used to summarize the&#xD;
      outcomes and other variables. Chi-square tests and t-tests will be used to compare outcome&#xD;
      variables between subgroups. The intention-to-treat analysis will be used such that those&#xD;
      lost to contact and refused cases at the follow-ups will be treated as no reduction in&#xD;
      cigarette consumption nor quitting. Subgroup analyses will be conducted among the &quot;adherence&quot;&#xD;
      cohort, which is classified as subjects who actively participant in the WhatsApp interaction.&#xD;
