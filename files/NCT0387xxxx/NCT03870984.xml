  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a problem of ever-growing importance, especially in industrialized countries, both&#xD;
      in adults and in the pediatric population. Children and obese adolescents, like adults, have&#xD;
      an increased risk, compared with normal-weight peers, to develop metabolic syndrome and&#xD;
      atherosclerotic disease, pathophysiological basis of cardiovascular events. Alteration of the&#xD;
      elastic properties of the arteries has been described previously in obese children and&#xD;
      adolescents and is considered an initial marker of atherosclerotic vascular damage. The&#xD;
      determination of the indices of arterial stiffness (PWV, Pulse Wave Velocity; AI,&#xD;
      Augmentation Index, SI, Stiffness Index) is possible through techniques currently used for&#xD;
      the determination of vascular function even in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nuts and hazelnuts are rich in potentially beneficial substances including unsaturated fatty&#xD;
      acids, especially omega-6 (present in both) and omega-3 (present only in nuts), Several&#xD;
      clinical trials have already shown in adults a potential beneficial effect of the addition of&#xD;
      different types of nuts (walnuts, hazelnuts, cashews, pistachios, etc.) on the&#xD;
      characteristics of the metabolic syndrome also through their possible antioxidant effect and&#xD;
      vasoactive. In children, some epidemiological studies have associated with a higher&#xD;
      consumption of nuts reduced risk of hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity and fasting glucose.&#xD;
      The study will be conducted with a randomized design with two arms in parallel with blinded&#xD;
      operator. The main objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of 15 grams of nuts and&#xD;
      15 grams of nuts a day in addition to a low calorie diet on the content of erythrocyte&#xD;
      membranes of alpha-linolenic acid three months after the beginning of the trial in a group of&#xD;
      obese children. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of walnuts and hazelnuts in&#xD;
      improving the systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure values, lipid profile, glucose and&#xD;
      fasting insulin, vascular function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a problem of ever-growing importance, especially in industrialized countries,&#xD;
      widespread both in adults and in the pediatric population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children and obese adolescents, like adults, have an increased risk, compared with&#xD;
      normal-weight peers, to develop high blood pressure, insulin resistance, diabetes,&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia, fatty liver disease and the resulting long-term complications. This cluster&#xD;
      of metabolic and hemodynamic risk factors, which is known as metabolic syndrome, greatly&#xD;
      increases the risk of cardiovascular events in adults. Cardiovascular disease is the leading&#xD;
      cause of mortality and morbidity in developed countries and are becoming even in developing&#xD;
      countries. Atherosclerotic disease is the pathophysiological basis of cardiovascular events.&#xD;
      Atherosclerosis is a multifactorial disease whose early stages of subclinical damage are&#xD;
      documented much earlier in cardiovascular events with non-invasive tests. The determination&#xD;
      of the indices of arterial stiffness (PWV, Pulse Wave Velocity; AI, Augmentation Index, SI,&#xD;
      Stiffness Index) is possible through techniques currently used for the determination of&#xD;
      vascular function even in children. The alteration of the elastic properties of the arteries&#xD;
      has been described previously in obese children and adolescents and is considered initial&#xD;
      marker atherosclerotic vascular damage. Fats particularly saturated fats, without adequate&#xD;
      intake of polyunsaturated fat, may facilitate the development of obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consumption of some specific foods including dried fruit (in a broad sense including&#xD;
      walnuts, hazelnuts, almonds, cashews, etc.) within a reduced calorie diet is considered to be&#xD;
      a promising approach in the prevention and care of the different components of the metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome. The nuts and hazelnuts are rich in potentially beneficial substances including&#xD;
      unsaturated fatty acids, especially omega-6 (present in both) and omega-3 (present only in&#xD;
      nuts), L-arginine, fiber, minerals, vitamin E, fitosetrols and polyphenols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several clinical trials have already shown in adults a potential beneficial effect of the&#xD;
      addition of different types of nuts (walnuts, hazelnuts, cashews, pistachios, etc.) on the&#xD;
      characteristics of the metabolic syndrome also through their possible antioxidant and&#xD;
      vasoactive effect .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In children, some epidemiological studies have associated a higher consumption of nuts with&#xD;
      reduced risk of hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity and fasting glucose alteration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our group conducted a study in obese children observing an inverse relationship between&#xD;
      omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, contained in large amounts in walnuts, and certain&#xD;
      features of metabolic syndrome, such as waist circumference, triglycerides, fasting insulin,&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure of 24-hours, suggesting a possible beneficial effect. The project was&#xD;
      financed by health ministry and included also the present Protocol (&quot;Obesity, hypertension&#xD;
      and subclinical vascular damage in children: the role of dietary factors and lipid mediators.&#xD;
      An epidemiological and translational study. &quot;Project Code: GR-2011-02349630).&#xD;
&#xD;
      From arachidonic acid, the main omega-6 type polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), certain&#xD;
      metabolites are produced via cytochrome P450 which have vasoactive and natriuretic effect:&#xD;
      20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), the epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and&#xD;
      dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs). From numerous studies in animal models and some human&#xD;
      studies, it is known that these metabolites via cytochrome P450 may be involved both in the&#xD;
      homeostasis of blood pressure pressure and in the development of hypertension. In particular,&#xD;
      plasmatic 20-HETE has a vasoconstrictor effect while EETs are vasodilators; both exert renal&#xD;
      natriuretic effect. Our study intends to verify if in a group of obese children, a&#xD;
      low-calorie diet that contains a portion of walnuts and hazelnuts, can change the content of&#xD;
      polyunsaturated fatty acids in erythrocyte membranes, particularly alpha-linolenic acid. This&#xD;
      could result in possible beneficial effects on the characteristics of the metabolic syndrome&#xD;
      in obese children, like an improvement of waist circumference, blood pressure, HDL&#xD;
      cholesterol, triglycerides and blood sugar. Our study also intends to acquire information on&#xD;
      the effect of the addition of walnuts and hazelnuts and the metabolites of polyunsaturated&#xD;
      fatty acids omega-3 and omega-6 metabolized by cytochrome P450 that derives from these nuts&#xD;
      in change vessel elasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. STUDY DESIGN The study will be conducted with a randomized design (two arms in parallel&#xD;
      with blinded operator). Doctors in charge of vascular measurements and laboratory technicians&#xD;
      will not know which of the two groups analyzed will only have taken the low-calorie diet and&#xD;
      who will have assumed the low-calorie diet with walnuts and hazelnuts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of 15 grams of nuts and 15 grams&#xD;
      of nuts a day in addition to a low calorie diet, in modifying the content of of&#xD;
      alpha-linolenic acid in erythrocyte membranes evalutated three months after the beginning of&#xD;
      the assumption in a group of obese children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the efficacy of walnuts and hazelnuts in improving in obese children:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure values;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  metabolic disorders (in particular of the lipid profile: LDL, HDL, triglycerides, and&#xD;
           glucose: glucose and fasting insulin);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  vascular function measured by tonometry (PWV and PWA), and ultrasonography (carotid&#xD;
           distensibility).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the modifications of the profile of eicosanoids via CYP450 in plasma and urine&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - the relationship between intake of nuts and hazelnuts, fatty acid profile of erythrocyte&#xD;
      membranes and eicosanoids via CYP450, the components of the metabolic syndrome including the&#xD;
      blood pressure and vascular elasticity.&#xD;
