  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well atorvastatin works in treating patients with stages&#xD;
      IIb-III triple negative breast cancer who did not achieve a pathologic complete response to&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Pathologic complete response is the lack of all signs of cancer in&#xD;
      tissue samples removed during surgery after upfront chemotherapy. Atorvastatin is used for&#xD;
      the treatment of high cholesterol and may reduce the risk of triple negative breast cancer&#xD;
      from coming back. Triple-negative breast cancer is a type of breast malignancy that is&#xD;
      comprised of cancer cells that do not have estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, or&#xD;
      large amounts of HER2/neu protein. Patients with TNBC do not have established systemic&#xD;
      therapies such as anti-estrogens or HER2-targeting agents to reduce recurrence after surgery,&#xD;
      and residual cancer found at surgery is associated with higher relapse rate.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the proportion of patients with undetectable circulating tumor cells (CTCs)&#xD;
      at 6 months in patients with stage IIB/III triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) who did not&#xD;
      achieve a pathologic complete response a (pCR) or Residual Cancer Burden-I (RCB-I) after&#xD;
      receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) with and without atorvastatin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if baseline fasting lipid profile level (low density lipoprotein cholesterol&#xD;
      [LDL-C]) and/or change in serum lipid levels are a predictive biomarker of change in the&#xD;
      proportion of patients with CTCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess effect of biomarkers on atorvastatin treatment response, defined as CTCs,&#xD;
      circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR),&#xD;
      C-reactive protein (CRP), serum Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and other inflammatory cytokines, for&#xD;
      the purpose of identifying the optimal patient population for future larger scale adjuvant&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine if baseline fasting lipid profile level (LDL-C) and/or change in serum&#xD;
      lipid levels are associated with 2-year relapse free survival (RFS) rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine if baseline CRP and/or change in serum lipid levels are a predictive&#xD;
      biomarker of change in the proportion of patients with CTCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine if baseline C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or change in CRP are associated with&#xD;
      2-year RFS rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To determine if baseline absolute number of CTCs and/or CTC change are associated with&#xD;
      2-year RFS rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To estimate the 2-year RFS rate of patients with TNBC who did not achieve pCR with and&#xD;
      without atorvastatin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To describe the toxicity and adverse events profile of atorvastatin treatment when&#xD;
      given concurrently with standard doses of radiotherapy to the chest wall and regional nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the correlation between multiplexed imaging biomarkers in the normal or tumor&#xD;
      tissue taken at the time of surgery, and response to atorvastatin-induced CTC changes or with&#xD;
      measured outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Patients receive standard of care atorvastatin orally (PO) once daily (QD) for up to&#xD;
      24 months. A physical exam is performed, and blood drawn at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after&#xD;
      starting standard of care treatment or at any time the disease appears to get worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Patients not eligible to receive atorvastatin, will be enrolled into non-statin&#xD;
      observation group with/without capecitabine treatment.&#xD;
