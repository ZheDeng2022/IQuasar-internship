    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, open phase I/II trial to evaluate feasibility, dosage,&#xD;
      safety and toxicity as well as efficacy of ex vivo expanded autologous T cells genetically&#xD;
      modified to express anti-CD20 and CD19 immunoreceptor (MBCART2019.1) in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed or resistant aggressive CD20 and CD19 positive B-NHL/CLL/SLL.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will be performed as a multi-center phase I/II trial with MB-CART2019.1 and&#xD;
      consists of part I. In part I, 12 to 18 patients with relapsed or resistant CD20 and CD19&#xD;
      positive NHL/CLL/SLL will be treated. Six plus three (6+3) patients in dose level 1 and 2&#xD;
      will be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be conducted in Hematology Departments of Hospitals which meet the structural&#xD;
      and personnel requirements for performing the planned regular trial-related investigations.&#xD;
      Only sites will be chosen with expertise in and necessary facilities for managing cytokine&#xD;
      release storm and other severe adverse events associated with this therapy such as&#xD;
      neurotoxicity. A corresponding training to site personnel prior to trial start must be&#xD;
      performed. The responsible intensive care unit (ICU) must be informed about the clinical&#xD;
      trial before inclusion of the first patient and the respective dosing date in order to make&#xD;
      sure that the medical staff of the ICU is able to react appropriately without any loss of&#xD;
      time in case of emergency. The University Hospital of Cologne will provide the Coordinating&#xD;
      Investigator. Additional clinical sites may be added during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be screened between day -30 and day -15. If the patient satisfies all the&#xD;
      protocol inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria, he/she will be included in the&#xD;
      clinical trial. Leukapheresis will be performed at the collection center on day -14 according&#xD;
      to local standard practice. The leukapheresis product of the patient will be shipped by a&#xD;
      special courier to the designated manufacturing center assigned by the sponsor. The&#xD;
      leukapheresis sample will be used for the individual manufacturing of MB-CART2019.1 by using&#xD;
      the automated CliniMACS Prodigy® System. The manufacturing of MB-CART2019.1 will start on day&#xD;
      -13 and will be finished on day -1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 5 of the manufacturing process the IPC (in-process-control) will indicate, if the&#xD;
      manufacturing process is successful. Therefore, the lymphodepleting chemotherapy must only be&#xD;
      started after the positive result of the IPC was confirmed by the manufacturer. Chemotherapy&#xD;
      for lymphodepletion will be done on days -5 to -3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of MB-CART2019.1 will be performed on day 0 in the Hematology Departments of&#xD;
      all sites. Patients will be followed up as inpatients until week 4 with close monitoring of&#xD;
      their vital functions and lab parameters for signs of adverse events. In the second follow-up&#xD;
      phase (week 4 until week 12), response will be assessed, and adverse events will be&#xD;
      documented. A follow-up examination will be performed at week 12 (achievement of primary&#xD;
      endpoint) and at month 12 which is considered end of trial or end of active part of the&#xD;
      trial. In the long-term follow-up yearly until 5 years or patient's death, safety and&#xD;
      response assessment as well as persistence of MBCART2019.1 will be performed. These&#xD;
      assessments will be analyzed and reported separately and are not part of the entire clinical&#xD;
      trial. This is a 6+3 trial design with a 0.3 log dose increment (1x106/2.5x106 MBCART2019.1&#xD;
      per kg BW in a single infusion) and maximum 2 dose levels. If none or one of the six patients&#xD;
      at dose level 1 experiences a dose limiting toxicity, another six patients will be treated at&#xD;
      dose level 2. If two DLTs are observed at dose level 1 another three patients will be treated&#xD;
      with the same dose. If more than two DLTs are observed at dose level 1, trial will continue&#xD;
      at dose level 0. Dose escalation continues until at least &gt;2 patients among a cohort of six&#xD;
      to nine patients experience dose-limiting toxicities or dose level 2 is completed. The MTD is&#xD;
      defined as the dose level below the dose inducing a DLT in more than 2 patients within one&#xD;
      dose level. DLT will be evaluated within 4 weeks after the infusion of MB-CART2019.1. An&#xD;
      interval of at least 28 days between the treatment of the first and the second patient in&#xD;
      each dose level is mandatory. An observation period for DLT of 28 days is considered to be&#xD;
      safe to exclude potential toxicities prior to inclusion of the next patients into the same&#xD;
      dose group or prior to dose escalation.&#xD;
