      A cross-sectional descriptive study which will investigate the Prevalence of Dental Traumatic&#xD;
      injuries in A Group of Egyptian Children with Special Health Care needs aging 6-14 years&#xD;
      Attending Pediatric Dentistry and Dental Public Health Department at Faculty of Dentistry,&#xD;
      Cairo University., Investigate the types, causes, and possible risk factors and treatment&#xD;
      sought.&#xD;

      Study Design:A Cross -sectional descriptive study design. Participant: Children with special&#xD;
      health care needs between 6 to 14 years. Setting: Patients coming to pediatric dentistry and&#xD;
      dental public health department in Cairo University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the procedures will be explained to the parents or guardians prior to the&#xD;
      investigation.An informed consent will be signed by parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:Data for the study will be collected using an interviewer - administered&#xD;
      questionnaire.The interviewer - administered questionnaire will be in Arabic in multiple&#xD;
      choice form and will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. History of current and previous dental trauma: including place and cause of the trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment sought :&#xD;
&#xD;
      If treatment was sought, the parent will be asked to indicate the type of treatment received:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pharmacological: prescription of pain killers, antibiotics, and tetanus injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Dental: restorative, endodontic, surgical, prosthetic, and splinting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If treatment was not sought, the parent will be asked to select one or more of the reasons&#xD;
      for this, including the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Financial: transportation, dental insurance coverage, and acceptance of insurance by&#xD;
           dentist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Parental attitude: lack of trust in dentists, inability to wait for appointment, lack of&#xD;
           dental awareness such as not knowing where to go, or the belief that the trauma was not&#xD;
           worth seeking treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Difficulties in getting an appointment: availability of dental clinics that was willing&#xD;
           to see the children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical examination will be carried out under artificial light of dental unit by using&#xD;
      mirror and Goldman- Fox periodontal probe according to custom-made examination chart which is&#xD;
      made according to Assessment of acute traumatic injuries chart (Adopted from American Academy&#xD;
      of Pediatric Dentistry, Pediatr Dent 24 (7suppl):95-96, 2002) and consisted of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Child's demographic data (Personal history), past and present medical history, past&#xD;
           dental history and history of the trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Extra oral examination and intra oral examination to detect:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The presence/absence of dental traumatic injuries determined by direct clinical&#xD;
                examination, when trauma is present will be recorded according to the Andreasen&#xD;
                classification (1994) .&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Condition of the injured tooth: mobility, tenderness to percussion, and&#xD;
                discoloration of traumatized teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Possible associated risk factors with dental traumatic injuries: overjet, overbite,&#xD;
                lip competence, anterior crowding.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Using Goldman -Fox periodontal probe overjet will be measured as the amount of&#xD;
                extension of the incisal edges of upper incisors labially beyond the incisal edges&#xD;
                of the lower incisors when the jaws are closed normally. Overbite will be measured&#xD;
                as the amount of overlap of the incisal edges of the upper anterior teeth and the&#xD;
                incisal edges of the lower teeth when the jaws are closed.&#xD;
