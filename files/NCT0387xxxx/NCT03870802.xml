      Monocentric, observational and prospective study in adult women having an early-stage breast&#xD;
      cancer without genetic risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to characterize quantitatively and qualitatively, after solitary&#xD;
      confinement, the resident breast stem cells and the immune system cells infiltrated in the&#xD;
      mammary gland in women:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  With a moderate risk of breast cancer progression (women with an early &quot;Luminal A&quot;&#xD;
           tumor) = Group A.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  With a high risk of breast cancer progression (women with an early &quot;Luminal B&quot; or basal&#xD;
           tumor) = Group B.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is one of the most frequent and the second cause of mortality for women in the&#xD;
      world. Breast is a complex organ which has several changes (puberty, pregnancy and&#xD;
      menopause). These modifications are controlled by numerous signals as those transmitted by&#xD;
      the oestrogens. They are possible through the presence of stem cells in the mammary gland&#xD;
      which are able to reply to these signals and can be the target of alterations leading to&#xD;
      cancer cells occurence. Breast tumors are composed of complex entities of different kinds of&#xD;
      cancer and normal cells which constitute the tumor micro-environment including the immune&#xD;
      system cells. This micro-environment transmits a lot of signals to cancer cells and&#xD;
      particularly stem cells which can contribute to their survival, the tumor progression and&#xD;
      interfere with the treatments efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The detection of the major deregulation of BMP2 synthesis by mammary micro-environment cells&#xD;
      may be a reliable and early biomarker of carcinogens exposure and an indicator of a high risk&#xD;
      of developing a luminal type breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immune micro-environment, which has an impact on solid cancer patients' survival, should&#xD;
      be taken into consideration for new therapeutic strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some infiltrating tumour immune cells, as macrophages (TAM) or regulating T and B cells, have&#xD;
      shown their key role in tumour escape and metastases apparition. It is relevant to associate&#xD;
      the evaluation of immune infiltrate to the breast stem cells in early stage tumours since the&#xD;
      literature suggests a functional interaction of these two cellular compartments, particularly&#xD;
      in the glioblastoma and the prostate cancer. It seems that mammary stem cells are a major&#xD;
      element in the comprehension of breast carcinogenesis but also in the possibilities of&#xD;
      repairing the mammary tissue controlling the mammary carcinogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is fundamental to clarify the role of stem cells and immunity. Our hypothesis is that&#xD;
      breast stem cells are altered in women having a high risk of cancer progression. They would&#xD;
      be responsible for a reduced activity of cellular repair and/or contribute to tumour&#xD;
      development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MACSSI project consists in isolating, quantifying and characterizing the breast stem cells&#xD;
      and the isolated immune cells of samples obtained for the prophylactic mastectomy in women&#xD;
      presenting different tumour progression risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be compared to normal samples already collected in women who had a breast&#xD;
      reduction.&#xD;
