  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The oral bio-availability of cannabidiol (CBD) is low due to poor water solubility and&#xD;
      susceptibility to extensive first pass metabolism, resulting in relative bio-availability of&#xD;
      6%.This project is designed to evaluate the plasma concentration vs. time profile of a self&#xD;
      emulsifying drug delivery system termed Long Chain Nano Lipospheres (LNL) for enhancing the&#xD;
      oral bio-availability of cannabidiol (CBD). The main goal of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      bio-equivalence of CBD in the LNL product, compared to CBD in a sesame oil vehicle and CBD&#xD;
      without any formulation, in powder form. Bio-equivalence is measured by AUC 0-24h, Tmax and&#xD;
      Cmax.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cannabidiol (CBD) is considered the non-psychoactive component of the cannabis plant with a&#xD;
      myriad of pharmacological attributes. There is preliminary data that CBD can be a useful&#xD;
      treatment for different therapeutic conditions such as epilepsy, anxiety, pain etc. CBD has&#xD;
      been investigated for its analgesic effect in patients with neuropathic and chronic pain,&#xD;
      especially resistant to other treatments. Further supportive evidence for CBD's efficacy in&#xD;
      treatment of pain, is established pre-clinically and requires additional research in a&#xD;
      clinical setting. The use of CBD in epilepsy has been assimilated in treatment guidelines in&#xD;
      many countries including Israel. However, the potential medical use of whole-plant cannabis&#xD;
      extracts, particularly in children with a developing brain, is limited by the psychoactive&#xD;
      properties and the adverse effects associated with long-term THC use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although a therapeutic rational for the use of CBD has been demonstrated, an optimal oral&#xD;
      dosage form to deliver this compound is not available yet. Oral administration is challenging&#xD;
      because of CBD's poor solubility and extensive first pass metabolism, leading to an oral&#xD;
      bioavailability of approximately 6%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, investigators utilize a bio-pharmaceutical method to enhance the&#xD;
      bioavailability of CBD using an advanced self-emulsifying drug delivery system termed Long&#xD;
      Chain Nano Lipospheres (LNL). The LNL formulation is composed of long chain triglycerides,&#xD;
      surfactants and co-solvent. This constellation is termed the pre-concentrate, which dissolves&#xD;
      CBD in its lipid core and administered in a soft gelatin capsule. When reaching the aqueous&#xD;
      phase of the GI tract, this pre-concentrate spontaneously forms a drug encapsulated O/W nano&#xD;
      emulsion. Previously, investigators have shown in a pre-clinical investigation that&#xD;
      incorporation of CBD into the LNL is a promising strategy to increase the compound's&#xD;
      bioavailability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the bioequivalence of the developed CBD-LNL&#xD;
      product to CBD in a sesame oil vehicle and CBD in powder form. Sesame oil is the commonly&#xD;
      used vehicle for cannabinoids oral uptake for lack of other options. However, this option&#xD;
      often leads to significant inter and intra subject variability in cannabinoids' plasma&#xD;
      concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed on 12 healthy male volunteers. It will be randomized, blind,&#xD;
      three way cross-over study intended to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of CBD. Each volunteer&#xD;
      will receive CBD-LNL capsule, CBD in sesame oil vehicle capsule and CBD without any vehicle&#xD;
      in powder form. All study groups will receive the same dose of CBD-90 mg. Blood samples will&#xD;
      be drawn from forearm 30 minutes before (pre-dose) and every 30 minutes interval for the&#xD;
      first 4 hours, then samples will be taken at 5,6,7,8,12 and 24 hours after the intake of the&#xD;
      study drug. Blood concentration profiles of CBD and its main metabolites 7-hydroxy-CBD and&#xD;
      CBD-glucoronide-11 will be determined in order to calculate the pharmacokinetic parameters of&#xD;
      CBD.&#xD;
