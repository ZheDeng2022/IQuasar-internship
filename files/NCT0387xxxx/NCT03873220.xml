      Sleep sensors, wrist worn accelerometers, polysomnography (PSG), and associated data analysis&#xD;
      platforms would provide quantitative and qualitative knowledge regarding the action of&#xD;
      scratching and sleep quantity in a symptomatic atopic dermatitis (AD) population. The overall&#xD;
      aim of this research is to validate the use of sensor technology and digital measures to&#xD;
      quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate scratch and sleep in AD patients, and specifically&#xD;
      in this study in children ages 2 to 11 years. To evaluate this experimental paradigm, the&#xD;
      investigators propose using wearable accelerometers, a sleep sensor, PSG, videography and&#xD;
      associated traditional patient-reported outcome measures/clinical outcome assessments&#xD;
      (PRO/COA) in patients/caregivers with AD in a well-controlled in-laboratory and at-home&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      To assess the feasibility of quantifying scratch and sleep in children with Atopic Dermatitis&#xD;
      (AD), children, age 2 to 11 years, with AD will be recruited. The subjects will complete&#xD;
      specific questionnaires related to itch, sleeping habits and AD and continuously wear two&#xD;
      wrist worn accelerometry devices. The EarlySense Sleep Monitor will also be placed underneath&#xD;
      the mattress to measure additional sleep related activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be comprised of two overnight sleep laboratory site visits. The clinic visits&#xD;
      will be followed by a continuous ~48 hour in-home environment assessment period (defined as&#xD;
      the subject's daily routine environment). During the sleep lab site visit, the subject and&#xD;
      accompanying parent(s)/guardian(s) will sleep overnight at the facility. The subject will be&#xD;
      video-recorded during the in-sleep lab visit, wear the wrist accelerometry devices, use the&#xD;
      sleep sensor and complete assessments (Depending on age, parent/guardian may complete some&#xD;
      assessments). Upon the completion of sleep lab activities the subjects will then continue to&#xD;
      wear the wrist accelerometry devices, utilize the sleep sensor and complete Patient Reported&#xD;
      Outcome/Clinical Outcome Assessments (PRO/COA) assessments during the 48 hour in-home&#xD;
      assessment. At the conclusion of the in-home portion of the assessment, the subject will&#xD;
      return the device/s and assessments to the facility and undergo brief assessments/interview.&#xD;

    <description>One GENEActiv watch will be used on each hand at a sampling rate of 100 Hz to measure movement in the x, y, and z direction. The movement will be analyzed using the algorithm described by Cole et al. to differentiate between periods of wakefulness and sleep.</description>

    <time_frame>From enrollment through the end of visit 5 (5 days +/- 2 days).</time_frame>
    <description>Polysomnography (PSG) will be used to report the number of sleep occurrences and appropriate sleep staging based on the scoring guide provided by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) for children. The following sleep stages will be scored: Stage W (wakefulness), Stage N1 (NREM 1), Stage N2 (NREM 2), Stage N3 (NREM 3), Stage N (NREM), and Stage R (REM).</description>
