      To evaluate the short term out comes of the polymer free stents in patients presented with&#xD;
      non ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (which include ST depression myocardial infarction&#xD;
      and unstable angina ) after percutaneous coronary intervention .&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the treatment options for CAD is a percutaneous coronary intervention through balloon&#xD;
      angioplasty or stent insertion . Although the restenosis rate can be reduced by using bare&#xD;
      metal stents , the in-stent restenosis (ISR) rate is still high at around 20%-30% .&#xD;
&#xD;
      increased rates of stent thrombosis were reported with first-generation DESs.(5) The high&#xD;
      rate of late and very late stent thrombosis is caused by a long duration of drug elution,&#xD;
      which can delay endothelial healing and prolong metallic structure exposure to blood vessel .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventionally, DES (drug eluting stents ) are coated with permanent polymers that facilitate&#xD;
      drug release and remain long after drug elution is complete. These permanent polymers can&#xD;
      cause delayed healing, impaired stent strut endothelialization , and a hypersensitivity&#xD;
      reaction, which can culminatein ST (stent thrombosis ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research has led to the design of the newer DES (drug eluing stents) that have biodegradable&#xD;
      polymers, novel coatings, or are completely polymer free. The polymer-free technology has the&#xD;
      potential advantage to reduce the inflammatory and prothrombotic risks related to the&#xD;
      utilization of polymers .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Our study will be conducted on at least thirty patients with non-ST-segment elevation&#xD;
           acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS)who will be subjected to the early invasive strategy&#xD;
           . Polymer-free drug eluting stents will be used for these patients instead of the&#xD;
           usually used polymer-permanent drug eluting stents .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with NST-ACS who will meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
           subjected to the following during the admission in the ICU :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of the patient concerning :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis of presenting complaint . Past history of previous similar complaints or the&#xD;
           coarse of his illness if he is known to have IHD(ischemic heart disease ) before . Risk&#xD;
           factors ( Diabetus mellitus , hypertension , smoking ,....) .Any other co-morbidities&#xD;
           and therapeutic history .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examination will be done with special concern payied for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, Jugular Venous Pressure (JVP), cardiac&#xD;
           examination and chest auscultation .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigations in the form of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serial 12 lead ECG .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory investigations : (Complete Blood Count (CBC) , Prothrombine time and&#xD;
           concentration ,Kidney function ,HCV-Ab , HBs-Ag , HIV Ab , Creatine kinase (CK and CK-MB&#xD;
           ) and Troponin at admission and 6 hours later ) .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imaging:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Echocardiographic evaluation with certain emphasis on the following parameters (Wall&#xD;
           motion abnormalities ,systolic function , diastolic function and cardiac dimensions).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction ) risk score will be calculated to every&#xD;
           patient .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each of the following criteria constitutes one point for TIMI scoring :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age ≥65 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three or more risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) (family history of CAD,&#xD;
           hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Known CAD (stenosis &gt;50%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aspirin use in the past 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe angina (≥2 episodes in 24 hours)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ST deviation ≥0.5 mm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Elevated cardiac marker level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Syntax score will be caiculated during PCI .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Early invasive strategy with percutaneous coronary intervention will be done for these&#xD;
           patients using Polymer-free drug eluting stents instead of the polymer-permanent drug&#xD;
           eluting stents .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patients will be followed for 6 months after the intervention .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patients included in the study will be followed up and re-evaluated at one month and&#xD;
           six months after the intervention ( by telephon calls and office visits )&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Re-evaluation will include asking about and analysing symptoms of IHD after the PCI ,&#xD;
           compliance to the medications .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examination: Vital signs , JVP , chest and heart examination .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12-lead ECG and cardiac enzymes if needed .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow up Echocardiography will be done at six months .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be subjected to follow up diagnostic coronary angiography six months of&#xD;
           PCI (whenever possible).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Six months views after the index procedure coronary angiography will be evaluated by&#xD;
           quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) with edge detection method used for evaluation&#xD;
           of coronary lesion in index and follow up procedures. Minimal luminal diameter (MLD),&#xD;
           Reference vessel diameter (RVD), Percent diameter stenosis %DS), Acute Gain, Late loss&#xD;
           and Late loss index will be estimated.&#xD;
