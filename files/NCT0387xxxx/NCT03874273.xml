  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Targeted therapy based on target identification by genetic examinations is a promising&#xD;
      direction in the treatment of patients with a complicated course of inflammatory&#xD;
      myofibroblastic tumor. Recently, the main work covered in foreign publications, aimed at&#xD;
      finding additional methods of treatment, by identifying new targets for targeted therapy in&#xD;
      patients with unresectable IMT, but currently there is no standardized approach to the&#xD;
      treatment of IMT in children worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study can show the benefits of the usage of crizotinib as targeted therapy in children&#xD;
      with ALK/ROS1 positive unresectable, progressive or reccurent inflammatory myofibroblastic&#xD;
      tumors. The main hypothesis is that crizotinib would increase an objective response rate in&#xD;
      this group of patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a rare type of childhood neoplasm characterized&#xD;
      by intermediate biological behavior. The main method of treatment of this tumor is a complete&#xD;
      surgical removal. It should be said, that in 2-5% of patients the presence of distant&#xD;
      metastases was noted at the time of diagnosis, in addition, the complex anatomical&#xD;
      localization of the process sometimes does not allow a radical surgical intervention. In&#xD;
      patients with unresectable IMT, the presence of distant metastases, residual tumor after&#xD;
      initial resection or progression of the disease, attempts have been made to prescribe therapy&#xD;
      with steroids , nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), cytostatic drugs. However, the&#xD;
      effectiveness of this therapy was low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the late 90s, it is known that with the identification of a number of specific&#xD;
      cytogenetic changes, this type of neoplasm is a true neoplastic process. In 50% of all cases&#xD;
      of IMT there are clonal translocations of the ALK gene located at the 2p23 encoding the&#xD;
      anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). It was shown that ALK gene activation is based on&#xD;
      translocations involving a large number of partner genes with tyrosine kinase activity.&#xD;
      Currently, there are more than 21 partner genes involved in the formation of chimeric&#xD;
      transcripts. The most frequent are TPM3, TPM4, CLTC, CARS, RANBP, EML4, TFG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The introduction of modern molecular genetic methods, including the next generation&#xD;
      sequencing (NGS), has expanded the understanding of the mechanisms of carcinogenesis in IMT.&#xD;
      Along with ALK gene rearrangements, the ROS1 gene (YWHAE-ROS1 and TFG-ROS1) and PDGFRB (NAB2)&#xD;
      genes were detected in the group of patients with ALK-negative IMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (crizotinib) has become possible not only in&#xD;
      patients with ALK-positive tumor, but also in a group of patients who do not have an ALK gene&#xD;
      rearrangement, but in whom a rearrangement of the ROS1 gene has been detected [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously, large-scale studies using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (crizotinib) have not been&#xD;
      conducted in patients under 18 with IMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase 1 study, conducted by the Children's Cancer Group (USA), showed the response rate&#xD;
      on therapy with crizotinib in 3/7 patients, and . disease stabilization in 4/7 patients&#xD;
      (Mosse Y., 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The median age of patients with IMT, included in the study, was 8.4 years (range 1.1 - 21.4).&#xD;
      In this study, it was noted that the use of crizotinib in a dose regimen of 280 mg / m2 twice&#xD;
      a day in this group of patients does not lead to an increase in the incidence of side effects&#xD;
      of grade 3 and 4. Thereby, the maximum permissible dose was determined, which amounted to 560&#xD;
      mg / m2 / day in two doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase 2 study, it was shown that in the group of patients with IMO a response in 86%&#xD;
      of cases has been achieved, with complete response in 36% (5/14), partial response in 50%&#xD;
      (7/14), and stabilization of the disease in 14% (Mosse Y., 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the recently published single-drug, open-label, non-randomized phase 2 study the objective&#xD;
      response rate on crizotinib in ALK+ patients was 50% (n=6/12) Schöffski P., et al. Lancet&#xD;
      Respir Med. 2018 Jun;6(6):431-441. doi: 10.1016/S2213-2600(18)30116-4. Epub 2018 Apr 15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's study is designed in order to show if the treatment with ALK-inhibitor&#xD;
      crizotinib is able to improve the outcome of pediatric IMTs in Russia.&#xD;
