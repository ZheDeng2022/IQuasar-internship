  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II randomized trial is for patients with clinical stage II-III, ER and PR &lt;10%,&#xD;
      HER2-negative invasive breast carcinoma (triple negative breast cancer) for whom adjuvant RT&#xD;
      is planned and pre-operative RT is deemed feasible by the treating radiation oncologist.&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized into arm A or B and treatment will last for 16 weeks. Both groups&#xD;
      will receive Durvalumab 750mg IV Q2 weeks x 2 then a biopsy prior to durvalumab 1500mg IV Q4&#xD;
      weeks x 3 with paclitaxel and carboplatin IV weekly x 12. Arm B will receive radiation (24 Gy&#xD;
      total) starting with the second durvalumab dose every other day (8Gy per fraction) for one&#xD;
      week. Following treatment, subjects will receive SOC breast surgery and continue on to&#xD;
      physician's choices SOC treatment during the 3 year follow up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study hopes to explore the impact of checkpoint blockade administration with a non-&#xD;
      anthracycline chemotherapy regimen plus RT on post-surgery pathologic complete response (pCR)&#xD;
      rate in the breast and axilla (ypT0/Tis ypN0) following 12 weeks of treatment and surgery.&#xD;
