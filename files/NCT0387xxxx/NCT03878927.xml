    <textblock>
      This is an open label study to assess the safety and efficacy of CPX-351 in combination with&#xD;
      gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) as first intensive therapy in older (age &gt;55 years) subjects with&#xD;
      newly diagnosed AML who are eligible for intensive induction chemotherapy, or AML subjects&#xD;
      who previously failed low-intensity therapy but who would be eligible for high-intensity&#xD;
      chemotherapy, with companion cognitive function testing to determine whether this contributes&#xD;
      to outcome in these subjects. Subjects may have received prior AML treatment with&#xD;
      non-intensive regimens, e.g. hypomethylating agents, low-dose cytarabine, or lenalidomide or&#xD;
      a clinical trial drug in combination with hypomethylating agents or low-dose cytarabine, but&#xD;
      may not have received intensive AML treatment with anthracyclines and/or infusional&#xD;
      cytarabine prior to enrollment on this trial. Subjects may not have been treated with GO or&#xD;
      other antibody targeting CD 33 prior to enrollment on this trial. The cohort will include 30&#xD;
      subjects treated with the combination of CPX-351 and GO and is designed to establish the&#xD;
      safety and feasibility of the combination. These subjects will be assessed for efficacy and&#xD;
      safety. Quality of life will be assessed using the FACT-LEU in all subjects. Cognitive&#xD;
      function will be assessed using the Blessed Orientation-Memory-Concentration Test and the&#xD;
      Montreal Cognitive Assessment.&#xD;

    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The relationship of cognitive function to outcome will be assessed using the Blessed Orientation-Memory-Concentration Test. The score for 6 items are multiplied to yield a &quot;weighted&quot; score. The higher the total weighted score, the more likely the patient has cognitive disability. Weight scores totaling greater than 10 are generally accepted as an indication of the presence of clinically meaningful cognitive impairment.</description>

It assesses different cognitive domains: attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation. The total possible score is 30 points; a score of 26 or above is considered normal.</description>
