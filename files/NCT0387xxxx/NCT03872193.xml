    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the effects of virtual reality applications on quality of&#xD;
      life, performance, balance, prosthesis adaptation and gait parameters in individuals with&#xD;
      transtibial amputation. 20 Transtibial amputee were included in study. All participants were&#xD;
      using transtibial prothesis with active vacuum system at least 1 year. Participants were&#xD;
      divided into two groups. While a group of virtual reality applications were being performed&#xD;
      additionally standart physiotherapy, only standard physiotherapy methods were applied in the&#xD;
      second group. Balance and gait practices were performed for each group. Individuals were&#xD;
      treated for 3 days a week for 4 weeks, and individuals were evaluated before and after&#xD;
      treatment. Individuals were evaluated for quality of life, performance, balance, prosthesis&#xD;
      adaptation and time-distance parameters of walking.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to compare the effects of virtual reality applications on quality of&#xD;
      life, performance, balance, prosthesis adaptation and gait parameters in individuals with&#xD;
      transtibial amputation.20 transtibial amputee with 36 mean age were included in study. All&#xD;
      participants were using transtibial prothesis with active vacuum system at least 1 year.&#xD;
      Participants were divided into two groups. While a group of virtual reality applications were&#xD;
      being performed, standard physiotherapy methods were applied in the second group. Balance and&#xD;
      gait practices were performed for each group. Individuals were treated for 3 days a week for&#xD;
      4 weeks, and individuals were evaluated before and after treatment. Individuals were&#xD;
      evaluated for quality of life, performance, balance, prosthesis adaptation and time-distance&#xD;
      parameters of walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose, SF-36 Questionnaire, 6-minute walking test, one leg rest time, Trinity&#xD;
      Amputation and Prosthetic Experience Scale, wearable biometric device and footprint method&#xD;
      were utilized. There was a statistically significant difference between the two groups in&#xD;
      pre-treatment and post-treatment performance, balance and gait parameters in the groups of&#xD;
      individuals (p &lt;0.05). The quality of life pain parameter was statistically decline in the&#xD;
      group receiving virtual reality (p&lt;0.05). On the other hand, significant differences in the&#xD;
      quality of life and prosthesis adaptation of the individuals were not found between the&#xD;
      groups (p&gt; 0.05). The results of this study showed that virtual reality practices and&#xD;
      standard physiotherapy methods are effective on performance, balance and walking in&#xD;
      transtibial amputee rehabilitation. It is thought that it will be important to perform&#xD;
      virtual reality applications in amputee rehabilitation separately in both methods, in&#xD;
      addition to standard physiotherapy methods, to include in rehabilitation process, to bring an&#xD;
      ability of alternative application to professionals working in this area and to work about&#xD;
      amputees with using different suspension systems and with different amputation levels.&#xD;
