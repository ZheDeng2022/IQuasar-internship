  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Motor vehicle crashes cause the death of an American child every 3 hours, more than any other&#xD;
      cause. When installed correctly, car seats reduce risk of serious injury and death to infants&#xD;
      and young children. Unfortunately, a large portion of child restraints is installed&#xD;
      incorrectly. A network of trained technicians work across the country to assist parents in&#xD;
      achieving correct use of child restraints through scheduled &quot;car seat checks,&quot; where&#xD;
      technicians work with parents to install restraints in their vehicles. Car seat checks are&#xD;
      effective in reducing errors in child restraint installations. However, the services are&#xD;
      highly underutilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study evaluates use of interactive virtual presence technology (also called&#xD;
      interactive merged reality) to remotely assist parents to install child restraints correctly&#xD;
      into their vehicles. Building from small pilot studies on the topic, the investigators will&#xD;
      conduct a randomized non-inferiority trial to evaluate whether parents who install child&#xD;
      restraints while communicating with a remote expert technician via interactive virtual&#xD;
      presence achieve installations and learning that are not inferior in their safety to parents&#xD;
      who install restraints live with a remote technician onsite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit 1476 parents at 7 locations nationwide and randomly assign&#xD;
      consenting parents to install their child restraint either via interactive virtual presence&#xD;
      or with a live technician. The correctness of installation safety will be assessed using&#xD;
      objective checklists, both following installation and again four months later. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to demonstrate that child restraint installation is accurate (&gt;90% correct)&#xD;
      when conducted remotely via interactive virtual presence, that such installations are not&#xD;
      inferior to the accuracy of installation with a live on-site expert, and that parents learn&#xD;
      and retain information about correct child restraint installation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Motor vehicle crashes cause the death of an American child every 3 hours, more than any other&#xD;
      cause. When installed correctly, car seats (also called &quot;child restraints&quot;) reduce risk of&#xD;
      serious injury and death to infants and young children roughly threefold. Unfortunately, a&#xD;
      large portion of child restraints is installed incorrectly. A network of trained technicians,&#xD;
      many affiliated with Safe Kids Worldwide, work across the country to assist parents in&#xD;
      achieving correct use of child restraints through scheduled &quot;car seat checks,&quot; where&#xD;
      technicians work with parents to install restraints in their vehicles. Car seat checks are&#xD;
      effective in reducing errors in child restraint installations. However, the services are&#xD;
      highly underutilized due to barriers in access, scheduling complications, and resources to&#xD;
      staff the car seat checks sufficiently to meet demand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study evaluates use of interactive virtual presence technology (also called&#xD;
      interactive merged reality) - joint and simultaneous remote verbal and visual interaction and&#xD;
      exposure to the same 3D stimuli - to remotely assist parents to install child restraints&#xD;
      correctly into their vehicles. If effective, this technology could supplement or replace car&#xD;
      seat checks, significantly reduce the number of errors made in car seat installations&#xD;
      nationwide, and revolutionize how government, industry, and non-profit agencies help parents&#xD;
      install restraints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Building from small pilot studies on the topic, the investigators propose a large randomized&#xD;
      non-inferiority trial to evaluate whether parents, including especially underserved parents&#xD;
      in rural areas and/or of underrepresented racial or ethnic minority background, who install&#xD;
      child restraints while communicating with a remote expert technician via interactive virtual&#xD;
      presence achieve installations and learning that are not inferior in their safety to parents&#xD;
      who install restraints live with a remote technician onsite. Non-inferiority trials are a&#xD;
      type of randomized trial whereby a novel treatment (in this case, interactive virtual&#xD;
      presence to install child restraints) is compared to an existing treatment known to be&#xD;
      effective (in this case, live one-on-one installation of restraints) to demonstrate the novel&#xD;
      treatment does not perform inferiorly to the existing treatment known to be effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To accomplish the study goals, the investigators will recruit 1476 parents at 7 Safe Kids&#xD;
      locations nationwide and randomly assign consenting parents to install their child restraint&#xD;
      either via interactive virtual presence or with a live technician. The correctness of&#xD;
      installation safety will be assessed using objective checklists, both following installation&#xD;
      and again four months later. The investigators aim to demonstrate that child restraint&#xD;
      installation is accurate (&gt;90% correct) when conducted remotely via interactive virtual&#xD;
      presence, that such installations are not inferior to the accuracy of installation with a&#xD;
      live on-site expert, and that parents learn and retain information about correct child&#xD;
      restraint installation.&#xD;
