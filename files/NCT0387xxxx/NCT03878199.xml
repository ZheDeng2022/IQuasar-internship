  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the best dose of ruxolitinib when given together with CPX-351&#xD;
      and to see how well they work in treating patients with accelerated phase or blast phase&#xD;
      myeloproliferative neoplasm. Ruxolitinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some&#xD;
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth. CPX-351 is a mixture of 2 chemotherapy drugs&#xD;
      (daunorubicin and cytarabine) given for leukemia in small fat-based particles (liposomes) to&#xD;
      improve the drug getting into cancer cells. Giving ruxolitinib and CPX-351 may work better in&#xD;
      treating patients with secondary acute myeloid leukemia compared to CPX-351 alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of ruxolitinib in combination with&#xD;
      liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine (CPX-351). (Phase I) II. To evaluate the&#xD;
      objective response rate in participants with post-myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN)-&#xD;
      accelerated phase (AP)/blast phase (BP) following treatment with the combination of&#xD;
      ruxolitinib and CPX-351 (per 2012 MPN-BP criteria). (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ruxolitinib in combination with CPX-351. (Phase&#xD;
      I) II. Assess survival outcomes and proportion of patients receiving transplant associated&#xD;
      with ruxolitinib in combination with CPX-351. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the rate of response among participants with MPN-AP/BP using European Leukemia&#xD;
      Net (ELN) criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess the proportion of treated participants with minimal residual disease. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of ruxolitinib followed by a phase II&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION: Patients receive CPX-351 intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5&#xD;
      and ruxolitinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 6-28 of cycle 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RE-INDUCTION: Patients with significant residual disease may receive CPX-351 IV on days 1 and&#xD;
      3 and ruxolitinib PO BID on days 4-28 of cycle 2 per the discretion of the treating&#xD;
      physician. Patients who have persistent disease following 2 cycles of therapy (induction and&#xD;
      re-induction) will be offered salvage chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSOLIDATION: Patients that have =&lt; 5% blasts in bone marrow receive CPX-351 IV on days 1&#xD;
      and 3 and ruxolitinib PO BID on days 4-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 cycles&#xD;
      provided that counts have partially recovered in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients who successfully complete consolidation therapy with a&#xD;
      continued =&lt; 5% blasts in bone marrow and have not undergone an allogeneic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation (SCT) receive ruxolitinib PO BID on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28&#xD;
      days for up to 8 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ALLOGENEIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION: Patients may undergo an allogeneic SCT at any time&#xD;
      after achieving =&lt; 5% blasts in bone marrow if they have a suitable donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 2&#xD;
      months for up to 1 year.&#xD;
