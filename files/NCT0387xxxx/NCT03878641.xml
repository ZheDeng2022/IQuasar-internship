  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Telepractice refers to the application of telecommunication technology (e.g., Skype, Webex,&#xD;
      Zoom) to the delivery of speech-language and audiology services. The development of&#xD;
      telepractice, an emerging alternative to traditional service delivery, has been driven by the&#xD;
      need for equitable access and cost-effective services to all client, regardless of&#xD;
      geographical locations, physical conditions, or social and economic status (Theodoros, 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of telepractice-delivered&#xD;
      intervention targeting literacy (i.e., reading and writing) and literate language skills&#xD;
      (e.g., narrative skills) to promote better academic outcomes in school-age children. The&#xD;
      investigators conduct a single-subject, multiple probe design across four participants to&#xD;
      examine the functional relation between a telepractice intervention and two educational&#xD;
      outcomes - reading self-corrections and narrative ability. Participants with language and&#xD;
      literacy needs receive three weekly intervention sessions via ZOOM (a videoconferencing&#xD;
      software). A single-subject, multiple-probe design across participants enables the&#xD;
      examination of treatment effectiveness: If three replications of treatment effect are&#xD;
      established across participants (i.e., visual analysis indicates evident behavioral change on&#xD;
      progress-monitoring assessment), the proposed intervention yields a high likelihood of&#xD;
      producing benefits to children who share similar learning needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to intervention effectiveness of telepractice, the investigators examine&#xD;
      feasibility along two dimensions: Fidelity and scoring reliability. Fidelity here includes&#xD;
      two components - fidelity of intervention (i.e., whether the intervention activities are&#xD;
      implemented as intended) and procedural fidelity of probe assessment administration (whether&#xD;
      the progress-monitoring probes are administered as intended). Scoring reliability (e.g.,&#xD;
      interobserver agreement) examines if the interventionist's scoring is consistent with a&#xD;
      reliability coder's scoring. Evidence derived from analyses of fidelity, reliability, and&#xD;
      intervention effectiveness will be examined collectively to determine the feasibility of&#xD;
      delivering literacy and language intervention via telepractice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The single-subject multiple-probe design comprises four phases: (a) eligibility&#xD;
      determination, (b) a baseline condition, wherein participants receive business-as-usual&#xD;
      practice, (c) a 15-week intervention condition, and (d) a maintenance condition (see Figure&#xD;
      1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility determination. The investigators employ a two-stage screening procedure&#xD;
      (psycho-educational assessments) to identify children in Grade 1 to 5 who demonstrate&#xD;
      language-based learning difficulties. Following the completion of the two-stage screening,&#xD;
      the investigators conduct a mock tutoring session to familiarize the potential participants&#xD;
      with the technology platform. The interventionist fills out a behavior checklist that&#xD;
      consists of steps needed to be accomplished in the mock session to determine if the child&#xD;
      meets the minimum criteria for telepractice candidacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline condition. In the baseline condition, the interventionist meets with each&#xD;
      participant three times a week to collect baseline data. Participants receive&#xD;
      business-as-usual instruction-that is, the interventionist stops the child immediately at&#xD;
      point of miscues, supplies the word, and tells the child to continue reading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention condition. The proposed intervention program consists of three components: (a)&#xD;
      Word reading and phonics instruction, (b) applying a comprehension monitoring strategy to&#xD;
      improve text reading accuracy, and (c) complex sentences use in written text. With each&#xD;
      participant, instruction is delivered in three 50-minute weekly sessions across 15 weeks.&#xD;
      Intervention activities delivered in the first, second, and third session of the week is&#xD;
      outlined in Figure 1. The interventionist collects the CUBED Narrative Language Measure (NLM)&#xD;
      probe on the fourth day of the week when no instruction is given. The 3-minute reading probes&#xD;
      will be administered on a weekly basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance condition. Across three weeks of no intervention, each of the progress-monitoring&#xD;
      assessments is administered once per week.&#xD;
