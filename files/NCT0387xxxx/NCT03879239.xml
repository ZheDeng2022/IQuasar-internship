    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, randomized, multicenter, adaptive design, single blinded,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Vibrant Capsule vs. placebo&#xD;
      in relieving constipation in subjects with Chronic Idiopathic Constipation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will come for 4 visits: Screening (visit 1), baseline (visit 2), after 4 treatment&#xD;
      weeks from baseline (visit 3) and after 8 treatment weeks from baseline (Final visit , visit&#xD;
      4). A total of 8 treatment weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three arms will be assessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vibrant Capsule mode A administered 5 times per week&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vibrant Capsule mode B administered 5 times per week&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo Capsule administered 5 times per week The difference between the 2 operating&#xD;
           modes is in the vibrating sequence during the capsule's operating time.&#xD;
