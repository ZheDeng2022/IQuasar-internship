      Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demonstrate functional markers derived from electrophysiological signals recorded during&#xD;
      cognitive tests. These markers should make it possible to optimize the targeting procedures&#xD;
      of electrode implantation sites for a better effectiveness of deep brain stimulation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanisms of action of the deep brain stimulation (DBS) involve the modulation of the&#xD;
      activity, locally and on a large scale, of functional cortical-subcortical networks showing&#xD;
      pathological behavior beforehand. The electrophysiological measurements in response to&#xD;
      different tasks make it possible to highlight precise dysfunctions of these neural networks,&#xD;
      in relation with the behavioral and / or motor disorders associated with the pathologies&#xD;
      treated by DBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, we hypothesize that the exploitation of electrophysiological responses during&#xD;
      cognitive or sensorimotor tasks performed during the implantation procedure of stimulation&#xD;
      electrodes in patients treated with DBS will allow :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To collect fundamental data to understanding the physiological functioning of basal&#xD;
           ganglia in humans ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To collect functional markers from the operating room in relation to the symptoms&#xD;
           targeted by the DBS that will help in the choice of implantation site of the stimulation&#xD;
           electrode ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Define long-term predictive markers of DBS effects by comparing electrophysiological&#xD;
           effects measured post-operatively and clinical scores under DBS.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pathology requiring brain stimulation therapy (criteria of severity, therapeutic&#xD;
             resistance and severity of disability): motor disorders (eg Parkinson's disease,&#xD;
             dystonia) or psychiatric disorders (eg OCD, depression).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  These pathologies therefore include motor disorders (eg Parkinson's disease, dystonia)&#xD;
             or psychiatric disorders that can be treated with brain stimulation therapy. Note that&#xD;
             these are independent of motor disorders. The inclusion criteria obviously depend on&#xD;
             the pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        As an example for a motor pathology treated by stimulation, in Parkinson's disease the&#xD;
