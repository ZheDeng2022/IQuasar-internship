      Aim of work:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To detect abnormal corneal thinning in keratoconus using pachymetry maps measured by&#xD;
           high-speed anterior segment optical coherence tomography (OCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the visualization and depth of the demarcation line with anterior segment&#xD;
           optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) after corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the depth of demarcation line between epithelial-on (Epi-on) and&#xD;
           epithelial-off (Epi-off) corneal collagen cross-linking.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Keratoconus is a bilateral, asymmetric, progressive, non-inflammatory corneal ectatic&#xD;
      disorder that is characterized by progressive thinning, steepening and potential scaring.&#xD;
      Usually it affects the inferior or central cornea that becomes thinner and bulges forward in&#xD;
      a cone-shaped fashion, inducing irregular astigmatism and myopia and reducing the quality of&#xD;
      vision. Approximately 50% of clinically normal fellow eyes will progress to KC within 16&#xD;
      years. The greatest risk is during the first 6 years of the onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Annual incidence of KC also varies greatly from 0.002% , to 0.23% of 100,000 population per&#xD;
      year. Most of the western studies support the lower figure of 0.002% , while in the&#xD;
      Middle-East it is about 0.02 per year. In the middle-East, there is about ten-fold higher&#xD;
      incidence (0.02% compared to 0.002%), and ten-fold higher prevalence (2.34% compared to&#xD;
      0.23%), as compared to Western counries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of keratoconus depends on a variety of factors including visual acuity, the degree&#xD;
      of corneal thinning and steepening. Rigid gas permeable contact lenses (RGPs) have been tried&#xD;
      to correct corneal irregularity and astigmatism in keratoconus but they don't stop&#xD;
      keratoconus progression. Corneal collagen cross linking (CXL) is now considered as the&#xD;
      treatment of choice in mild to moderate cases of keratoconus and is proven to halt the&#xD;
      disease progression. The implantation of intrastromal corneal ring segments (e.g. INTACS,&#xD;
      Ferrara &amp; Keraring) has been indicated for cases with moderate keratoconus to flatten the&#xD;
      steep irregular corneas. Advanced cases of keratoconus with marked deterioration of vision or&#xD;
      corneal scarring may be good candidates for deep anterior lamellar or penetrating&#xD;
      Keratoplasty (DALK or PKP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collagen cross-linking (CXL) is a relatively new conservative approach for progressive&#xD;
      corneal ectasia, which is able to strengthen corneal tissue reforming new covalent bonds.&#xD;
      This strategy is based on the underlying pathology of the disease. Corneal collagen cross&#xD;
      linking (CXL) idea was based on the fact that a photosensitizer substance like riboflavin&#xD;
      (vitamin B2) can interact with ultraviolet irradiation (Ultraviolet-A) to strengthen the&#xD;
      corneal tissue inter and intrafibrillar collagen bonds thus preventing further thinning,&#xD;
      corneal protrusion and reduces corneal irregular astigmatism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epithelial debridement enhances riboflavin corneal penetration that allows absorption of wide&#xD;
      range of light spectrum wave lengths including ultra violet A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The idea of trans-epithelial delivery (Epi-on technique) of riboflavin into the corneal&#xD;
      tissue was hindered by the fact that riboflavin can't penetrate intact corneal epithelium.&#xD;
      The addition of certain molecules such as trometamol allows penetration of riboflavin into&#xD;
      the corneal stroma that markedly reduces the possible complications of removing of the&#xD;
      corneal epithelium (Epi-off technique) such as persistent epithelial defects, scarring and&#xD;
      serious infectious keratitis. Another advantage of trans-epithelial CXL that it reduces the&#xD;
      cytotoxic effects of ultraviolet irradiation on corneal endothelium and intraocular&#xD;
      structures especially in thin corneas less than 400 um.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, CXL techniques were developed to minimize ultraviolet exposure and shorten the time&#xD;
      of the procedure on basis of photochemical reciprocity in which increased irradiation&#xD;
      intensity with reduced intervals achieve the same effect of the conventional cross linking&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corneal collagen cross linking induces stromal collagen fiber shrinkage. Ultraviolet A&#xD;
      exposure enhances covalent bond formation between collagen fibers especially in the anterior&#xD;
      stroma where 65% of ultraviolet irradiation is absorbed within first 250 um thus a&#xD;
      hyperrefelctive transitional area can be detected between the anterior cross linked and the&#xD;
      posterior untreated corneal stromal tissue referred to as a demarcation line that is usually&#xD;
      evident 1 - 6 months after CXL procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comprehensive slit lamp examination could detect the demarcation line; however anterior&#xD;
      segment ocular coherence tomography (AS-OCT) is a more sensitive tool to assess the extent&#xD;
      and depth of a stromal demarcation line that is deeper centrally than peripherally due to the&#xD;
      natural corneal curvature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies confirm the effectiveness and safety of conventional cross-linking procedure,&#xD;
      which is also known as &quot;Dresden protocol&quot;, in which the interaction between 0.1% riboflavin&#xD;
      molecules absorbed in corneal tissue and UV-A rays delivered at 3 mW/cm2 for 30 minutes (5.4&#xD;
      J/cm2 energy dose) releases reactive oxygen species that promote the formation of &quot;molecular&#xD;
      bridges&quot; between and within collagen fibers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corneal cross-linking causes a dose-dependent keratocytes damage. Wollensak et al. described&#xD;
      cellular apoptosis to a depth of 300 µm radiating with UV- A at 3 mW/cm2. Histopathological&#xD;
      studies showed an already complete keratocyte apoptosis limited to the anterior stroma within&#xD;
      24 hours. Some authors characterized the corneal stromal DL as a clinical sign to evaluate&#xD;
      the depth of the CXL treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies hypothesize the role of the DL after CXL depth as representative of CXL&#xD;
      effectiveness. Recently, the essential debate focused on whether the depth of the corneal&#xD;
      stromal DL is indeed a true indicator of CXL efficacy. The main question is whether &quot;the&#xD;
      deeper, the better&quot; principle can be applied to CXL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) and confocal&#xD;
      microscopy have been used as tools to assess the depth of DL and consequently the depth of&#xD;
      the cross-linking effect. By using the AS-OCT, the stromal DL is detected within an enhanced&#xD;
      image of the cornea in the horizontal meridian. The image is captured when the corneal reflex&#xD;
      is visible, and the depth of DL is measured using the caliper tool provided by the&#xD;
      manufacturer. Doors et al described the best visibility of corneal stromal DL using AS-OCT at&#xD;
      1 month after CXL treatment, with an average DL depth of 313 µm; Yam et al measured the depth&#xD;
      of DL at 6 months highlighting that the severity of ectasia and age may cause a worse DL&#xD;
      visibility.&#xD;
