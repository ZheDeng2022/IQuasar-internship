  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well low dose ipilimumab works in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab in treating patients with melanoma that has spread to the&#xD;
      brain. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab and pembrolizumab, may&#xD;
      help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor&#xD;
      cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined as complete response (CR) + partial&#xD;
      response (PR) + stable disease (SD) &gt; 6 months, in the brain in subjects with melanoma brain&#xD;
      metastasis (MBM) per modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1&#xD;
      criteria who are treatment naive to anti-PD-1 agents in the metastatic setting (prior&#xD;
      adjuvant anti-PD1 allowed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess clinical benefit rate (CBR) in the brain in subjects with MBM per modified&#xD;
      RECIST 1.1 in patients who previously progressed on PD-1 inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS). III. To evaluate the&#xD;
      brain-specific safety and tolerability of the combination regimen in subjects with or without&#xD;
      stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) received prior to study entry, or on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate cytokine levels and changes in the T-cell population in the cerebrospinal&#xD;
      fluid (CSF) and blood in patients treated with combination low dose ipilimumab and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess changes in relative apparent diffusion coefficient as measured by magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) as an early predictor of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To assess changes in circulating cfDNA (cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid) as determinants&#xD;
      of response and/or markers of early progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To evaluate molecular and immunological changes in extracranial lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ipilimumab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes and pembrolizumab IV over 30&#xD;
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 4 cycles for ipilimumab and up to&#xD;
      35 cycles for pembrolizumab in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 6 weeks for&#xD;
      the first year, and then every 12 weeks thereafter.&#xD;

             Ethics Committee) approved written informed consent form in accordance with regulatory&#xD;
             and institutional guidelines. This must be obtained before the performance of any&#xD;
             protocol related procedures that are not part of normal subject care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment schedule,&#xD;
             laboratory testing, and other requirements of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed malignant melanoma with measurable metastases in the brain&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Tumor tissue should be of good quality based on total and viable tumor content.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who do not have tissue specimens may undergo a biopsy during the&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Tumor tissue from bone metastases is not evaluable for PD-L1 expression and is&#xD;

             (creatinine clearance).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 ULN OR direct bilirubin =&lt; ULN for participants with total&#xD;
