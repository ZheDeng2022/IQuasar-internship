    <textblock>
      Part I- Observational study In the first part , investigator would investigate and compare&#xD;
      the energy requirements and substrate utilization in healthy subjects and in patients with&#xD;
      liver cirrhosis of various etiologies across the disease severity state viz compensated,&#xD;
      stable decompensated, critically ill cirrhotics. The investigator would also enroll patients&#xD;
      with chronic kidney disease, critically ill patients of acute liver failure or acute on&#xD;
      chronic liver failure as disease controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II- Randomized Controlled Study All the eligible, critically ill cirrhotic patients on&#xD;
      mechanical ventilator support would be randomized to a control group (receiving the&#xD;
      nutritional therapy as per the standard enteral nutritional practice in a critical care&#xD;
      setting) or the intervention group (receiving enteral nutrition based on proposed measured&#xD;
      requirements by Indirect calorimetry (IC) given till the patient is in ICU(Intensive care&#xD;
      unit). The IC would be done thrice a week in both groups.&#xD;
