    <textblock>
      This research is being done to see if it is safe and feasible to give the investigational&#xD;
      drugs, nivolumab (also known as BMS-936558) before surgery to people with newly diagnosed or&#xD;
      recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN). Patients with recurrent disease&#xD;
      may have a limited number of sites of metastatic (spread) squamous cell carcinoma of head and&#xD;
      neck. Another goal of this study is to learn how nivolumab impacts the immune system's&#xD;
      ability to treat the cancer. While nivolumab is approved by the U. S. Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with metastatic SCCHN with progression on&#xD;
      or after platinum-based chemotherapy, the word &quot;investigational&quot; in this context means that&#xD;
      the study drugs are not approved by the FDA for the treatment of head and neck cancers prior&#xD;
      to surgery and thus is still being tested in research studies. However, the FDA is allowing&#xD;
      the use of nivolumab in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will have two arms. Cohort (arm) 1 will examine one dose of nivolumab given about&#xD;
      4 weeks before surgical resection (removal) of a newly diagnosed SCCHN. Twelve patients will&#xD;
      be enrolled to this arm. Cohort 2 will examine one dose of nivolumab given about 4 weeks&#xD;
      before surgical resection (removal) of SCCHN which has recurred and possibly spread to&#xD;
      distant sites, but still can be resected with one surgery. Twelve patients will be enrolled&#xD;
      to this arm.&#xD;
