    <textblock>
      Study goals are to determine if a novel post-surgical foot offloading device can reduce&#xD;
      post-operative pain and expedite the return to daily activity following fat grafting.&#xD;
      Investigators will perform a prospective, randomized study utilizing PopSole™, a novel fully&#xD;
      customizable post-operative shoe insert, to aid in the recovery of patients post-surgical fat&#xD;
      graft injections for pain and limited activity due to foot disorders (ie. fat pad atrophy of&#xD;
      the forefoot, heel, or for chronic plantar fasciitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard of care fat grafting is often used in plastic surgery for cosmetic or reconstructive&#xD;
      reasons. Foot fat grafting, though not considered part of this research trial, is routinely&#xD;
      offered in the UPMC Aesthetic Plastic Surgery center as a cosmetic surgery option; however,&#xD;
      treatment modality options following the completion of a foot fat grafting procedure to&#xD;
      protect the fat grafts and reduce weight bearing on the fresh fat grafts are limited. Current&#xD;
      standard of care options including crutches, scooters, bulky post-operative shoes (ie. Darco&#xD;
      shoes [Darco Intl. Huntington WV.]), and the addition of padding to insoles or orthotics that&#xD;
      attempt to offload the treated area. Most of these devices are flat and provide poor&#xD;
      anatomical support, leading to compensatory gait issues which can lead to further problems&#xD;
      and pain in the knees, hips, and back. The most common complication with post-operative foot&#xD;
      gear is non-compliance: patients do not wear it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have devised a novel foot offloading device (PopSole™) which will allow for&#xD;
      customization of the area where the fat has been injected into the foot, as well as allow for&#xD;
      customizable arch support and elevation of the metatarsals. By randomizing patients to&#xD;
      recovery with standard methods versus this new device, the investigators are hopeful for&#xD;
      earlier patient ambulation and return to work with decreased pain.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Subjects will complete the following screening research procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline reported outcome measures (PROMs) questionnaires and surveys that will take&#xD;
           approximately 25 minutes to complete:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) questionnaire to assess subject ADL and&#xD;
                function ability&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mayo Clinical Scoring System questionnaire (MAYO) to assess subject pain, activity&#xD;
                and function&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society questionnaire (AOFAS) to assess subject&#xD;
                pain and function&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Manchester Foot and Ankle Disability Index to assess subject foot pain/discomfort&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pittsburgh Foot Survey to assess subject pain, activity, life satisfaction/quality&#xD;
                of life&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Offload Device Survey to assess the ease and comfort of the offload device&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Foot ultrasounds will be performed to assess and measure baseline thickness of the&#xD;
           plantar fascia, forefoot, or heel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 2D Photographs of both feet will be performed for a visual baseline assessment skin and&#xD;
           soft tissue thickness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the clinical fat graft procedure occurs on a day different from the screening visit, the&#xD;
      following research activities will be completed at Visit 2 if the subject continues to remain&#xD;
      interested and eligible for study participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Collection of subject's vital signs (Temp, HR, Resp., BP), medication profile,&#xD;
           allergies, weight, BMI calculation and adverse event collection and reporting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Medical and surgical history collection review - the Investigator will confirm that the&#xD;
           subject's medical status has not changed since last seen and the subject continues to&#xD;
           satisfy eligibility criteria for study intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Performance of a limited physical and foot exam by PI and /or Co-investigator MD&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Women of childbearing potential will receive a urine pregnancy dip test with results&#xD;
           documented to study chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Diary cards with instruction to start entry on the diary card 24 hours after the fat&#xD;
           grafting surgery to continue through Post-operative Visit 4 (Month 1) and be placed to&#xD;
           study chart. The subject will be instructed to document self-assessment of the following&#xD;
           events pertaining to the surgical site: Pain, Bruising, Redness of the skin, Itching,&#xD;
           Swelling, Bleeding, Other (any concerns/issues not listed). The subject will be&#xD;
           instructed to identify on the diary card the location, date and day of each documented&#xD;
           event. Unresolved events at Visit 4 will be carried over for documentation to the&#xD;
           adverse event log.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. 2D Photographs of both feet&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Offload Device Distribution to remain in use at all times during ambulation and activity&#xD;
           instruction to stay off of feet as much as possible for 3 days, then limit ambulation to&#xD;
           10 minutes per hour for 4 weeks and no sports, kicking, running or exercise for 4 weeks.&#xD;
           Devices will be provided for both feet to maintain symmetry and gait stability between&#xD;
           the two feet.&#xD;
