  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the reproducibility over time of functional and structural&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging, as well as specific biomarkers in plasma in healthy volunteers&#xD;
      before and after a two-hour rest. This design mimics the timing of repeated scans and blood&#xD;
      sampling before and after two hours of anaesthesia in subsequent substudies of the protocol,&#xD;
      'Neuroplasticity Induced by General Anaesthesia'.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the study 'Neuroplasticity Induced by General Anaesthesia', the investigators intend to&#xD;
      explore the effects of general anaesthesia on the brain by state-of-the-art magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI data - especially changes in functional MRI recordings - may theoretically depend on a&#xD;
      variety of physiological variables such as cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume, and&#xD;
      cerebral metabolic oxidative rate of oxygen, and may thus also be affected by pharmacological&#xD;
      agents. However, to interpret data it is important to know the inherent variability of the&#xD;
      scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This first substudy therefore aims to determine the reproducibility of the MRI recordings&#xD;
      without administration of pharmacological agents. Another aim of the study is to ensure&#xD;
      feasibility of the design before embarking on the more resource-demanding substudies in&#xD;
      anaesthetised subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this substudy, the investigators will perform the same MRI measurements as in the main&#xD;
      study; rather than undergoing two hours of general anaesthesia, the volunteers will be&#xD;
      subjected to two hours of undisturbed rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant goes through a pre-study interview and physical examination to ensure that&#xD;
      the participant is healthy and suitable for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each participant, the study consists of three study days:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 0: Baseline MRI and blood tests. Intervention. Two hours of post-intervention care&#xD;
      followed by post-intervention MRI and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day +1 (the day after Day 0): MRI and blood tests. Day +7 (one week after Day 0): MRI and&#xD;
      blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All MRI scans will be performed with a 3 Tesla Philips Achieva d-stream with a 32-channel&#xD;
      receive head coil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests: Haemoglobin, sodium, potassium, white blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), S&#xD;
      calcium-binding protein 100b (S100b), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), interleukin-1 (IL-1),&#xD;
      IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-18, tumor necrosis factor Alpha (TNF-Alpha) and transforming growth&#xD;
      factor beta (TGF-beta).&#xD;
