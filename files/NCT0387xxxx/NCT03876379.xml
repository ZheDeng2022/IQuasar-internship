  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the operating room, the state of anesthesia is monitored during general anesthesia-induced&#xD;
      hypnosis through EEG-based neuro-monitoring. Recent studies suggest that variables extracted&#xD;
      from per-operative EEG change as brain ages. Furthermore, aging is itself an independant&#xD;
      factor associated to an increased sensitivity to General Anesthesia (GA). Among fragility&#xD;
      sign, per-operative Burst Suppression (BS) has been associated to a poor postoperative&#xD;
      cognitive trajectory. The main goal of this observational clinical study is to extend the&#xD;
      traditional use of per-operative EEG to the detection and prediction of various degrees of&#xD;
      brain fragility, depending on the depth of anesthesia (DoA).&#xD;

      Main objective : Extend the traditional use of per-operative EEG to the detection and&#xD;
      prediction of various degrees of brain fragility, depending on the depth of anesthesia (DoA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indices derived from the EEG signal, Spectral Edge Frequency 95 (SEF95), Patient State Index&#xD;
      (PSI) and Bi-spectral Index (BIS) are now widely used in the operating room to monitor the&#xD;
      Depth of Anesthesia (DoA). Recent studies suggest that variables extracted from per-operative&#xD;
      EEG change as brain ages. A detailed reading of the quantitative EEG (qEEG) under GA has been&#xD;
      recently described depending both on the specific drug used and patients' age. For GA induced&#xD;
      with Propofol (2,6 di-isopropylphenol), a GABAergic receptor agonist used in Total Intra&#xD;
      Venous Anesthesia (TIVA), the EEG signal under frontal derivations exhibits a specific&#xD;
      signature characterized by a powerful alpha band. However, the elderly attenuates these EEG&#xD;
      characteristics, which might be the results of a change in thalamic-cortical function and&#xD;
      decreased neuronal excitability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this observational clinical study is to assess the fragility of a patient under&#xD;
      GA and based on the EEG SEF13 characteristics, weighted by the amount of Propofol&#xD;
      administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures are based on EEG signal and subfrequency power spectral densities including alpha&#xD;
      band as well as the amount of Propofol, each measured for EEG periods where SEF 95 = 8-13Hz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design: This is a single-center, interventional, category I prospective study&#xD;
      (minimal risks and constraints)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population concerned : Patients eligible for interventional neuroradiology or orthopedic&#xD;
      surgery performed under GA are selected to participate in this prospective, observational,&#xD;
      single-center, routine care study. Patients will be included if they received, for a&#xD;
      non-urgent scheduled procedure, a Total IntraVenous Administration (TIVA) anesthesia by&#xD;
      Propofol according to the Schnider model combined with a morphine derivative. Minor patients,&#xD;
      pregnant women and patients who refused to provide informed consent are excluded from the&#xD;
      study. Patients with a BMI &gt; 36 kg/m2 for whom the Schnider model is not validated are also&#xD;
      excluded. Patient demographics will be collected during the anesthesia consultation. Total&#xD;
      IntraVenous Anesthesia (TIVA) and Target Controlled Infusion (TCI) are used for morphine&#xD;
      derivative and Propofol, EEG parameters will be collected from frontal electrodes montage&#xD;
      (Fp1, Fp2, F7, F8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Proceedings : Measures are based on EEG signal through routine EEG-based&#xD;
      neuro-monitoring and subfrequency power spectral densities including alpha band as well as&#xD;
      the amount of Propofol, each measured for EEG periods where SEF95 = 8-13Hz. Standard&#xD;
      monitoring (Pulse Oxygen Saturation: SpO2, Heart Rate: HR, Systolic, Diastolic and Mean&#xD;
      Arterial Blood Pressure: SBP, DBP, MAP, Temperature, End tidal CO2: (EtCO2) and&#xD;
      electro-encephalogram monitoring by the Masimo Sedline monitor (SEF 95, PSI and BS) will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General anesthesia is then induced in a standardized manner with a morphine followed by&#xD;
      intra-venous administration of Propofol. All the measures are obtained non-invasively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual benefit: There is no benefit for the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collective benefit: Aging is associated to change in cerebral activity and it's crucial to&#xD;
      distinguishes fragile patients from normal ones. The tailoring of doses according to the&#xD;
      degree of &quot;cerebral fragility&quot; could predict poor postoperative cognitive or behavioral&#xD;
      evolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks and minimal constraints added by the research: No added risk. The procedure is&#xD;
      performed according to the usual protocol including routine EEG-based neuro-monitoring All&#xD;
      the measures are obtained non-invasively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all patients whatever the comorbidities, anesthesia induction will be performed using a&#xD;
      target-controlled infusion (Orchestra® Base Primea - Fresenius Kabi France). According to our&#xD;
      standard of care, intra-operative episodes of hypotension (mean arterial pressure (MAP) &lt; 65&#xD;
      mmHg or &lt; 80% baseline) are treated by Norepinephrine bolus of 10 μg. For all patients, data&#xD;
      from EEG-neuromonitoring and hemodynamic data are collected at the end of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of selected subjects Selection of patients up to 60 analysable patients Number of&#xD;
      Centre : 1 Research Agenda inclusion period: 12 months duration of participation (treatment +&#xD;
      follow-up): duration of the interventional neuroradiology or orthopedic procedure: 1 day&#xD;
      total duration: 12 months Number of planned inclusions by centre and month : 5 Number of&#xD;
      subjects required : 60&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics The significance level used in this study chose as 0.05. The values is expressed&#xD;
      in percentage for qualitative variables and median (InterQuartile Range: [IQR]) for&#xD;
      quantitative variables. All parameters will be recorded and the brain total power spectral&#xD;
      density (PT), alpha band power spectral density (Pα) and the Propofol TCI (µg/ml) will be&#xD;
      calculated on the entire population. The median value of Pα,PT,PropofolTCI combination will&#xD;
      be compared using non-parametric Kruskal Wallis and Man Whitney tests for quantitative data,&#xD;
      while qualitative variable will be analyzed based on the Fisher's test. Research on the&#xD;
      correlation between age and brain total power spectral is carried out by Pearson's test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then analysis will be also performed according to the occurrence of BS during induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia. ROC curves will be constructed from univariate logistic régressions. For each&#xD;
      univariate regression investigators provided Odd Ratios (OR) given with a 95% Confidence&#xD;
      Interval (CI) and Areas Under the Curve (AUC). Multivariate analysis is finally performed&#xD;
      with a logistic regression model where explanatory variables are chosen according to the&#xD;
      results of the univariate analysis (p-value≤0.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size calculation is based on the following assumptions : Assuming an incidence of&#xD;
      40% BS, with a power at 80% and an alpha risk at 5%, it is necessary to include 60 patients&#xD;
      to highlight an area under the ROC curve of 80% with a confidence interval width of 0.1.&#xD;
