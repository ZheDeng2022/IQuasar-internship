  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trial Subjects (patients), will receive single infusions of pembrolizumab in combination with&#xD;
      CXD101 every 3 weeks for two years or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity&#xD;
      develops.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Trial Subjects (patients) who are deemed eligible for the trial will initially be entered&#xD;
      into the safety run-in stage of the trial. Up to 12 patients will be registered into the&#xD;
      safety run-in stage, in cohorts of 3 patients at a time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 patients will be registered initially and will be administered a single infusion of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab (200mg, day 1) in combination with CXD101 (20mg twice daily days 1 to 5). This&#xD;
      is dose level 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If 0 to 1 dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed, 3 more patients will be entered into the&#xD;
      trial and treated at dose level 0. If 0 to 1 DLT is observed across all 6 patients, the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be declared and the expansion stage of the trial will be&#xD;
      opened.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If more than 1 DLT is observed at dose level 0, 3 patients will be recruited and treated at&#xD;
      dose level -1. The CXD101 dose will be reduced by 25% (20mg in the morning and 10mg in the&#xD;
      evening, days 1 to 5), while the pembrolizumab dose will remain the same (200mg, day 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If 0 or 1 DLT is observed, 3 more patients will be recruited and treated at dose level -1. If&#xD;
      0 or 1 DLT is observed across all 6 patients the maximum tolerated dose will be declared and&#xD;
      the expansion stage of the trial will be opened.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If more than 1 DLT is observed at dose level -1 the combination will be deemed excessively&#xD;
      toxic and no further patients enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the MTD is declared, the cohort will be expanded and a further 33 patients will be&#xD;
      treated at this dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will continue to receive pembrolizumab and CXD101 at 3 weekly intervals for a&#xD;
      maximum of 2 years or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity develops. Patients&#xD;
      on pembrolizumab will be seen every 3 weeks during trial treatment. Patients who progress&#xD;
      will be seen annually for disease status. Patients completing treating or who stop treatment&#xD;
      early for reasons other than disease progression will be followed every 3 months for up to&#xD;
      one year after the end of treatment, and annually thereafter until end of trial is declared&#xD;
      (when the last patient has completed 1 year follow up).&#xD;

    <description>Pembrolizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody which targets the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor. It blocks a protective mechanism on cancer cells, and allow the immune system to destroy these cancer cells. CXD101 is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor which kills cancer cells by blocking the vital functions of HDAC enzymes.</description>
