  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Western Equine Encephalitis Virus (WEEV), Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus (EEEV), and&#xD;
      Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus (VEEV) are transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes&#xD;
      and can cause encephalitis (swelling of the brain) and other neurological manifestations,&#xD;
      including fever, chills, discomfort, feeling sick, muscle pain and then headache, vomiting,&#xD;
      restlessness, irritability, seizures, coma, and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccines teach the body to prevent or fight an infection. When the body learns to fight an&#xD;
      infection, this is called an immune response. Researchers developed a vaccine against&#xD;
      Western, Eastern and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses to help the body make an immune&#xD;
      response. There are no live or killed viruses in the vaccine, so you cannot get infected with&#xD;
      any of these 3 viruses from getting the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental trivalent encephalitis vaccine, VRC-WEVVLP073-00-VP, is composed of Western&#xD;
      equine encephalitis (WEE), Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), and Venezuelan equine&#xD;
      encephalitis (VEE) virus-like particles (VLP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test three doses (6 mcg, 30 mcg, and 60 mcg) of this&#xD;
      experimental vaccine against Western, Eastern and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, open-label, dose-escalation study to examine the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and immune response of three doses (6 mcg, 30 mcg, and 60 mcg) of the WEVEE&#xD;
      vaccine (VRC-WEVVLP073-00-VP) alone or with alum adjuvant (VRC-GENMIX083-AL-VP) in a&#xD;
      2-product administration regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects were randomized to WEVEE alone (Groups 1, 3, and 5) or WEVEE plus alum&#xD;
      (Groups 2, 4, and 6, respectively) in each dose group. No more than 1 subject was randomized&#xD;
      and vaccinated per day for the first 3 subjects at each dose. If the 6 mcg dose of WEVEE was&#xD;
      assessed as not showing safety concerns by a Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT),&#xD;
      randomization began for Groups 3 and 4 (30 mcg WEVEE without alum and with alum,&#xD;
      respectively). In a second safety review conducted on the first 3 subjects to receive 30 mcg,&#xD;
      if the 30 mcg dose of WEVEE was assessed as not showing safety concerns by the PSRT,&#xD;
      randomization began for Groups 5 and 6 (60 mcg WEVEE without and with alum, respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The product was administered in the upper arm muscle as an intramuscular (IM) injection via&#xD;
      needle and syringe at Day 0 and 8 weeks later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all groups, solicited reactogenicity was evaluated using a 7-day diary card. Assessment&#xD;
      of vaccine safety included clinical observation and monitoring of hematological and chemical&#xD;
      parameters at clinical visits throughout the study.&#xD;

WEVEE vaccine alone (Group 1, Group 3, and Group 5) or, WEVEE vaccine mixed with alum (Group 2, Group 4, and Group 6, respectively).&#xD;
The study started by randomizing subjects to get a dose of 6 mcg in Group 1 or Group 2. Safety data were reviewed after 2 weeks to make sure this vaccine dose had no safety concerns before subjects were randomized to get the next dose of 30 mcg in Group 3 or Group 4. Safety data were reviewed again to make sure the 30 mcg vaccine dose had no safety concerns before subjects were randomized to the 60 mcg dose in Group 5 or Group 6.&#xD;
A total of 30 subjects were randomized among the 6 groups.</intervention_model_description>

        <title>Number of Subjects Reporting Local Reactogenicity Signs and Symptoms For 7 Days After Each Product Administration</title>
        <description>Subjects recorded the occurrence of solicited symptoms on a diary card for 7 days after each study product administration and reviewed the diary card with clinic staff at a follow up visit. Subjects were counted once for each symptom at the worst severity if they indicated experiencing the symptom at any severity during the reporting period. The number reported for &quot;Any Local Symptom&quot; is the number of subjects reporting any local symptom at the worst severity. Reactogenicity grading (Mild, Moderate, Severe) was done using the Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials (modified from FDA Guidance - September 2007).</description>
        <time_frame>7 days after each product administration, at approximately Week 1 and Week 9</time_frame>
        <population>Population included all enrolled subjects who received at least one study injection and provided safety data (via diary card and/or laboratory results) following the injection.</population>

        <title>Number of Subjects Reporting Systemic Reactogenicity Signs and Symptoms For 7 Days After Each Product Administration</title>
        <description>Subjects recorded the occurrence of solicited symptoms on a diary card for 7 days after each study product administration and reviewed the diary card with clinic staff at a follow up visit. Subjects were counted once for each symptom at the worst severity if they indicated experiencing the symptom at any severity during the reporting period. The number reported for &quot;Any Systemic Symptom&quot; is the number of subjects reporting any systemic symptom at the worst severity. Reactogenicity grading (Mild, Moderate, Severe) was done using the Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials (modified from FDA Guidance - September 2007).</description>
        <time_frame>7 days after each product administration, at approximately Week 1 and Week 9</time_frame>
        <population>Population included all enrolled subjects who received at least one study injection and provided safety data (via diary card and/or laboratory results) following the injection.</population>

        <description>Any abnormal laboratory results recorded as unsolicited adverse events (AEs) are summarized. Safety laboratory parameters included hematology (hemoglobin, hemoglobin change from baseline, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), platelets, and white blood cell (WBC), red blood cell (RBC), neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, eosinophil and basophil counts) and chemistry (alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine). Complete blood count (CBC), differential, platelet, and ALT results were collected at screening (≤ 28 days before enrollment), Day 0 prior to study product administration (baseline), and at Days 14, 28, 56, 70, 84, 168 and 252. Creatinine results were collected at screening, Day 0 and Day 56. Institutional laboratory normal ranges as well as the Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventative Vaccine Clinical Trials (modified from FDA Guidance, September 2007) were used.</description>

        <description>Unsolicited AEs and attribution assessments were recorded in the study database from receipt of the first study product administration through the visit scheduled for 4 weeks after each study product administration. At other time periods between study product administrations and when greater than 4 weeks after the last study product administration, only serious AEs (SAEs reported as a separate outcome and in the AE module) and new chronic medical conditions that required ongoing medical management were recorded through the last study visit. The relationship between an AE and the study product was assessed by the investigator based on clinical judgment and the definitions outlined in the protocol. A subject with multiple experiences of the same event is counted once using the event of worst severity.</description>

At other time periods between study product administrations and when greater than 4 weeks after the last study product administration, only serious AEs (SAEs reported as a separate outcome and in the AE module) and new chronic medical conditions that required ongoing medical management were recorded through the last study visit. The relationship between an AE and the study product was assessed by the investigator based on clinical judgment and the definitions outlined in the protocol.

Unsolicited AEs were reported from receipt of the first injection through 4 weeks after the last study injection administered. Following the time period defined for AEs through the last expected study visit at Day 252, only new chronic medical conditions were collected as unsolicited AEs. Serious AEs (SAEs) were reported from receipt of the first study injection through the last expected study visit at Day 252.</time_frame>
      <desc>All AEs recorded on the study were reported. Solicited AEs collected through systematic assessment and unsolicited AEs collected through non-systematic assessment are reported for participants who received study product and had safety data collected following the product administration. Data represent the number and percentage of participants experiencing the event. A participant with multiple experiences of the same event is counted once using the event of worst severity.</desc>
