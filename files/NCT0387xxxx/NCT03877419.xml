      Comparison of different drilling speed to classify bone quality by tactile sensation on a saw&#xD;
      bone model&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bone quality is one of the major factors influencing the dental implant survival rate. Bone&#xD;
      quality is believed to have effects on initial implant stability and success of&#xD;
      osseointegration. Different implant designs and surgical protocols were developed for&#xD;
      improving the survival rate in different bone quality. Although bone quality can be partly&#xD;
      diagnosed by radiographic images, lots of experienced surgeons also evaluate bone quality&#xD;
      with tactile sensation when they drill the bone. However, variations in evaluation of bone&#xD;
      density maybe exist among different surgeons. The drilling speed also may have effect on the&#xD;
      outcome of evaluation. For less experienced dentists, it is difficult to diagnose bone&#xD;
      quality with tactile sensation in the beginning. The purpose of this study is to find proper&#xD;
      drilling speed to classify bone quality by tactile sensation on a saw bone model. Saw bones&#xD;
      of variant densities are used as training &amp; testing materials. The proper drilling speed to&#xD;
      distinguish different bone quality will be evaluated and offered to junior dentists for&#xD;
      better implant treatment outcome.&#xD;

    <measure>Units on a Visual Analog Score for bone density</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>the range of the visual analog score was from 0 to 100, 0 indicated drilling into the air, 100 indicated drilling into the hardest jaw bone. The investigators will provide participants several saw bone blocks with different density. Participants needed to answer each bone density of blocks on the scale by drilling feedback sensation after drilling. It's better result that the answers close to the correct bone density of the saw bone blocks.</description>
