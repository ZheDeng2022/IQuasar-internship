  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The R-TAVI study is a randomized pilot study examining the use of the right radial artery&#xD;
      versus the femoral artery for secondary vascular access during transcatheter aortic valve&#xD;
      implantation (TAVI).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The R-TAVI study is a prospective, single institution, pilot study in which eligible TAVI&#xD;
      patients will be randomized pre-procedurally to receive either secondary radial artery (RA)&#xD;
      access or femoral artery (FA) access during TAVI. Our study will take place over a projected&#xD;
      18 month enrollment period.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1) Patient meets eligibility for TAVR as decided upon by pre-TAVR testing (Echo, cardiac&#xD;
        catheterization, CTA TAVR, 2 CT surgical consults, heart team discussion). 2) Undergoing&#xD;
        TAVR procedure and follow-up at Carilion Clinic Cardiology Roanoke Memorial Hospital (CRMH)&#xD;
        3) Patient's secondary vascular access can be performed femorally OR radially, as&#xD;
        determined by TAVR operator after review of pre-TAVR CT scan imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4) Interventional Cardiologist performing the TAVR agrees to consider patient for&#xD;
        enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5) Patient provides consent 6) Age ≥ 18 years old 7) No evidence of precluding arterial&#xD;
        disease of both femoral arteries 8) No evidence of precluding arterial disease of right&#xD;
        radial and subclavian arteries 9) Must have palpable pulses in both radial arteries&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Review of pre-TAVR CT scan imaging deems patient unsuitable for radial OR femoral&#xD;
             secondary access based on presence of excessive calcification, stenosis, or tortuosity&#xD;
             of the femoral, subclavian, or innominate arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Valve implantation (primary access) planned via alternative vascular access&#xD;
             (trans-caval, axillary, carotid, direct aortic, trans-apical)-as determined by&#xD;
             implanting Interventional Cardiologist/TAVR operator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery in which a radial artery graft was&#xD;
             harvested and used as a conduit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients on hemodialysis OR with arteriovenous fistulas.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Interventional Cardiologist performing the TAVR declines patient consideration in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient declines consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Urgent or emergent TAVI cases&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patient is already participating in another clinical research study&#xD;
