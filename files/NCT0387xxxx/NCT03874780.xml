The OAB-q questionnaire is a validated, multi-sectional questionnaire that assesses the patient's coping with overactive bladder symptoms. The questionnaire is commonly used in clinical research and clinical setting for this indication, and consists of the following 6 scores:&#xD;
Symptoms severity score&#xD;
Coping score&#xD;
Concern/worry score&#xD;
Social score&#xD;
Sleep score&#xD;
Quality of life score These scores are further analyzed to obtain two domains: Quality of Life total score (improvement is demonstrated in higher scores), and Symptoms Bother Score (improvement is demonstrated in lower scores).</description>
