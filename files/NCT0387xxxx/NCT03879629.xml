    <textblock>
      Breast cancer patients undergoing trastuzumab-based HER2-directed therapy are at risk of&#xD;
      heart function decline or heart failure symptoms, but it is unknown if, when, and for how&#xD;
      long cardiovascular protective strategies, e.g. with a beta-blocker, could help. This study&#xD;
      randomly assigns those taking curative-intent trastuzumab-based HER2-directed therapy to the&#xD;
      beta-blocker carvedilol-either when significant heart function decline or subtle early signs&#xD;
      of heart injury (either by elevation of a cardiac blood biomarker, i.e. cardiac troponin, or&#xD;
      by an abnormal heart ultrasound marker, i.e. global longitudinal strain) are noted, or&#xD;
      preventatively before beginning trastuzumab-based HER2-directed therapy. This study will&#xD;
      further randomly assign those patients on carvedilol to either discontinuation at the end of&#xD;
      trastuzumab-based HER2-directed therapy or continuation for another year, providing much&#xD;
      needed clinical trial data on what the best strategy (&quot;tactic&quot;) for those at risk of&#xD;
      cardiotoxicity with trastuzumab-based HER2-directed therapy is.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the current application is to evaluate different strategies of&#xD;
      cardiovascular therapy with carvedilol, aiming to reduce the incidence of LVEF decline and HF&#xD;
      in patients undergoing curative intent trastuzumab-based HER2-directed therapy for breast&#xD;
      cancer. It will compare: a) a pre-emptive preventive approach, i.e. cardiovascular therapy&#xD;
      with the beta-blocker carvedilol started before trastuzumab-based HER2-directed therapy and&#xD;
      b) a reactive preventive approach, i.e. cardiovascular therapy started in response to early&#xD;
      subclinical signs of cardiac dysfunction/injury (either cardiac troponin elevation or&#xD;
      abnormal global longitudinal strain), with the current standard approach of initiation&#xD;
      cardiovascular therapy once cardiotoxicity has occurred, addressing the question if and at&#xD;
      which point in time carvedilol therapy would be efficacious. It will furthermore compare&#xD;
      outcome measures between a limited carvedilol therapy duration, confined to the time of the&#xD;
      active trastuzumab-based HER2-directed treatment and cardiac function recovery versus an&#xD;
      extended carvedilol therapy duration continuing one year after completion of&#xD;
      trastuzumab-based HER2-directed therapy, addressing how long carvedilol needs to be given in&#xD;
      this unique patient population. The above will be combined with pharmacogenomic measures to&#xD;
      identify those at highest risk of irreversible LVEF decline and lack of response to therapy.&#xD;
      The investigator's central hypothesis is that a pre-emptive or a reactive preventive approach&#xD;
      will reduce the incidence of cardiotoxicity in breast cancer patients undergoing treatment&#xD;
      with trastuzumab, and that extension of carvedilol therapy beyond the active&#xD;
      trastuzumab-based HER2-directed therapy treatment will prove superior for preservation of&#xD;
      cardiac function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three specific aims will be pursued:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: to compare the incidence of a) HF or asymptomatic decline in LVEF by &gt;10% in patients&#xD;
      whose LVEF is ≥50% or LVEF drop ≥5% in those with a decrease to &lt;50%. (primary aim #1), and&#xD;
      b) reversible LVEF decline to within 5% of baseline (secondary aim #1) with a pre-emptive and&#xD;
      reactive preventive approach with carvedilol versus a &quot;wait-and-see strategy&quot; of carvedilol&#xD;
      initiation in response to HF or LVEF declines in breast cancer patients over the course of&#xD;
      trastuzumab therapy. It is to address the question if and when to start cardioprotective&#xD;
      efforts for patients undergoing trastuzumab therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To compare the delta change in LVEF from completion to one year after completion of&#xD;
      trastuzumab therapy between cardioprotective approach with carvedilol confined the duration&#xD;
      of trastuzumab therapy or extended for one year thereafter. This aim is to address the&#xD;
      question of duration of cardioprotective efforts for patients undergoing trastuzumab therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To identify genetic variants that predict trastuzumab cardiotoxicity in general as&#xD;
      well as lack of response (primary prevention of drop in LVEF or secondary improvement of&#xD;
      LVEF) to carvedilol.&#xD;
