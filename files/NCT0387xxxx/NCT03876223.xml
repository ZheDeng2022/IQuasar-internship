  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine small vessel disease (a condition in which the small&#xD;
      arteries in the heart become narrowed). The investigators want to know how the small vessel&#xD;
      disease contributes to pre-HFpEF (a condition with inadequate heart muscle function in the&#xD;
      setting of preserved muscle pumping) and to better identify potential treatment for&#xD;
      prevention of HFpEF. The main procedures of this study include up to 2 clinic visits (initial&#xD;
      visit and a second clinical visit only if participants are unable to complete all research&#xD;
      procedures at the initial visit); a 6-week phone interview visit, 4 quarterly follow-up phone&#xD;
      interview visits in year 1; year 1 follow up cardiac MRI based on availability and ongoing&#xD;
      annual follow-up phone interview visits to track progress. If participants choose to take&#xD;
      part in this study, participants direct participation will end after 1 year, participants&#xD;
      will then have the option of participating in ongoing annual check-in calls. Participants&#xD;
      will be asked to undergo a physical exam and provide a completed medical history; complete a&#xD;
      Cardiovascular (or Cardiac) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMRI) with contrast agent; complete&#xD;
      questionnaires to describe heart symptoms and overall quality of life status; undergo blood&#xD;
      draws to provide blood samples for research testing, and allow the study team to have access&#xD;
      to medical records.&#xD;

      Coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) due to changes in the function and structure of&#xD;
      coronary microcirculation in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) is&#xD;
      poorly understood. Ischemia with no obstructive CAD (INOCA) and myocardial infarction with no&#xD;
      obstructive CAD (MINOCA) are increasingly observed in women and men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once established, the investigators will be well positioned to aggressively target identified&#xD;
      mechanistic targets in a specific well-characterized at-risk population, with the primary&#xD;
      goal of preventing progression to HFpEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this novel hypothesis, the investigators propose the following Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that CMD-related ischemia contributes to myocellular damage and&#xD;
      impaired ventricular relaxation. CMD will be measured directly, using our established&#xD;
      intracoronary pharmacological vasoactive protocol, in subjects with signs/symptoms of&#xD;
      ischemia but no obstructive CAD. In our labs (&gt;420 patients), ~60% of those tested have&#xD;
      evidence for CMD. All subjects will perform provocative stress testing with isometric&#xD;
      handgrip - chosen for its unique ability to increase myocardial afterload and myocardial&#xD;
      oxygen demand - while myocardial ischemia will be assessed directly through invasive&#xD;
      simultaneous arterial and coronary sinus/great cardiac vein oxygen tension and lactate&#xD;
      measurements, and continuous ECG's recordings. Left ventricular function will be directly&#xD;
      assessed using Millar-catheter LV pressure-volume loops (perfected in our lab over the past&#xD;
      24 months). Stress-induced myocellular damage will be directly measured by coronary&#xD;
      sinus/great cardiac vein hs-cTnI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that CMD-related ischemic myocellular damage contributes to LV&#xD;
      diastolic dysfunction progression. Subjects from Aim 1 will also undergo comprehensive&#xD;
      cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) at enrollment and 1-2 years later. The&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate CMRI LV perfusion, myocardial scar, diffuse fibrosis, LV&#xD;
      remodeling, and diastolic function. The investigatorswill leverage the strengths and&#xD;
      resources of our world-renowned proteomics core to establish evidence of chronic myocellular&#xD;
      damage using prospectively repeated ambulatory hs-cTnI determinations.&#xD;
