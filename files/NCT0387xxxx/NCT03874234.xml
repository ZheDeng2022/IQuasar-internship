  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK profile of single&#xD;
      and repeat ascending doses of GSK3186899 in healthy subjects. This is a Phase 1 first time in&#xD;
      human study, to investigate the effect of food on PK of GSK3186899. This study will consists&#xD;
      of two parts. Part A (dose escalation phase) will be a single ascending, sequential&#xD;
      cross-over design in cohorts 1, 2 and 3 of subjects. Cohort 1 and 2 will be 4-way cross-over&#xD;
      which includes 4 dosing regimens of GSK3186899 and placebo (3:1 ratio) under fasted&#xD;
      conditions. Cohort 3 will be 2-way cross-over which includes 2 treatment periods, 2 dosing&#xD;
      regimens in fasted and fed conditions. In Part B (repeat dose escalation phase) subjects will&#xD;
      be randomized to receive repeat doses of either GSK3186899 or placebo (3:1 ratio) in either&#xD;
      fed or fasted conditions. Part B will be conducted based on the review of all safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and PK data from Part A. The study duration includes screening, treatment&#xD;
      periods and follow-up.&#xD;
