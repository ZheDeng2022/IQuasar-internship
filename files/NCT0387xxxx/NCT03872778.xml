             surgical sterility is defined as bilateral salpingectomy (or bilateral oophorectomy or&#xD;
             hysterectomy).&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. Use of oral, injected, or implanted hormonal methods of contraception. In case of&#xD;
                  use of oral contraception, women should be stable on the same pill for a minimum&#xD;
                  of 3 months before taking [177Lu]-NeoB treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or&#xD;
                  cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository&#xD;
                  Post-menopausal women are allowed to participate in this study. Women are&#xD;
                  considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12&#xD;
                  months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile&#xD;
                  (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six months of&#xD;
                  spontaneous amenorrhea with serum Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) levels &gt; 40&#xD;

                  oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy or tubal ligation at&#xD;
