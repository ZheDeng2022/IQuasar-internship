  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to collect information regarding usefulness of positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) scans using a special dye called 68Ga-DOTATATE for patients with&#xD;
      neuroendocrine tumours by determining the number of of patients whose clinical management was&#xD;
      changed as a result of the scans.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When patients are suspected of having neuroendocrine tumours, they will usually undergo&#xD;
      various imaging scans such as computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI), and octreotide scintigraphy (octreoscan) to try to identify the primary tumour. During&#xD;
      the patients' course of disease, they will continue to have various CT, MRI, and/or&#xD;
      octreoscans. Sometimes, despite using scans, laboratory tests, and examination, it is still&#xD;
      difficult to properly diagnose neuroendocrine tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doctors have found that most neuroendocrine tumours make too much of a hormone called&#xD;
      somatostatin on their cell surface. Because of this doctors have been using positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) scans using a special contrast dye called 68Ga-DOTATATE in hopes of better&#xD;
      diagnosing and managing neuroendocrine tumours. 68Ga-DOTATATE can label the cells that have&#xD;
      somatostatin (such as neuroendocrine tumour cells) so that the PET scan can take better&#xD;
      pictures and doctors can better diagnose and manage the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, despite 68Ga-DOTATATE PET scans showing promise, it is still not widely accessible.&#xD;
      Because of this, researchers are creating a registry for patients who may need 68Ga-DOTATATE&#xD;
      PET scans to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify their primary tumour where the doctor suspects is a neuroendocrine tumour&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Staging of the neuroendocrine tumour&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Restage the tumour prior to surgery/radiotherapy or help to assess the tumour where&#xD;
           standard scans such as CTs, MRIs, or octreoscans are not properly showing your tumours&#xD;
           despite other clinical or laboratory tests showing that your disease has progressed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For other issues when confirmation of site of disease and/or disease extent may impact&#xD;
           clinical management of the neuroendocrine tumour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This registry help the participant's treating physician to obtain approval for the&#xD;
      participant to undergo 68Ga-DOTATATE PET scans for their neuroendocrine tumour.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to undergo PET/CT without sedation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any of the following indications:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For the initial diagnosis of patients with clinical (e.g., signs, symptoms)&#xD;
                  and/or biochemical (e.g., tumor markers) suspicion of neuroendocrine tumours&#xD;
                  (NETs) but for whom conventional imaging is negative or equivocal or for whom&#xD;
                  biopsy is not easily obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For the staging of patients with localized primary NETs and/or limited metastasis&#xD;
                  where definitive surgery is planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Restaging of patients with NET where surgery or peptide-receptor radiotherapy&#xD;
                  (PRRT) is being considered; OR, where conventional imaging is negative or&#xD;
                  equivocal at time of clinical and/or biochemical progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  As a problem-solving tool in patient with NET when confirmation of site of&#xD;
                  disease and/or disease extent may impact clinical management.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Approved by a review panel&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindication for PET examination as per institutional safety guidelines, including&#xD;
             but not limited to pregnancy, or inability to lie still for PET examination.&#xD;
