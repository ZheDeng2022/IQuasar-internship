      PROBLEM STATEMENT Stroke is the fifth cause of death in the United States and the number one&#xD;
      cause of long term disability. Annually around 800,000 persons are diagnosed with stroke in&#xD;
      this country, causing the death of around 130,000 persons, each 4 minutes one person die due&#xD;
      to this disease in the U.S.A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Mexico there is very few statistical information published about stroke, according to the&#xD;
      Mexican clinical practice guidelines &quot;CENETEC&quot; this disease was the third cause of death,&#xD;
      with the 5.6% percent of the main death causes, with an estimated rate of 25.6/100,000&#xD;
      habitants and more than 25,000 deaths per year according to data of the health department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The monetary cost of the direct attention and the indirect expenses is enormous, with an&#xD;
      approximate expenditure of 34 billion dollars per year. Around 20% of the survivors require&#xD;
      special care during the first 3 months after a stroke event and around 30% remain with a&#xD;
      severe disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Mexico there is an alarming increase of stroke cases that correlates with the demographic&#xD;
      transition to an older population, and also to the increase of risk factors for vascular&#xD;
      atherothrombotic disease, as the hypertension, diabetes, obesity and dyslipidemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local statistics show that from the different type of stroke the distribution in Mexico is:&#xD;
      72.94% as ischemic stroke, 20.17% hemorrhagic and 6.8% with subarachnoid hemorrhage, this&#xD;
      numbers are similar to the statistic reported in the literature of other countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the first multicentric registry in Mexico &quot;The Premier Study&quot; the distribution&#xD;
      of the etiology of the ischemic stroke was: large vessel atherosclerosis 8%, cardiac embolism&#xD;
      20%, lacunar stroke 20% , miscellaneous 5% and undetermined etiology 41%. In Mexico only 0.6%&#xD;
      of the patients with stroke are treated with I.V. thrombolysis, and of these patients, 33%&#xD;
      arrived in a window &lt;3 hrs. after the onset of the stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      JUSTIFICATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medical care and diagnosis of the patients with stroke is considered a medical emergency,&#xD;
      studies have reported the denominated &quot;Time is brain&quot; due to the fact, that patients with a&#xD;
      typical large vessel ischemic stroke, each minute 1.9 million neurons, 14 billion of synapsis&#xD;
      and around 12 km. of myelinated fibers are lost, this remark the need of an early diagnosis&#xD;
      and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to &quot;The Premier Study&quot; one of the most concerning outcomes in the medical care of&#xD;
      stroke in Mexico is that only a fifth of the patients with stroke arrive to the hospital&#xD;
      within the window for I.V. thrombolysis, and of them &lt; 1% receive treatment with rTPA. This&#xD;
      is due to factors as the lack of specialized medical teams for an opportune and precise&#xD;
      diagnosis, a limited number of staff with expertise in stroke and a lack of technological&#xD;
      resources for diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fort he particular case of the stroke, there are several characteristics that propitiate the&#xD;
      use of artificial intelligence (A.I.) systems, some of them are the great quantity of data&#xD;
      and multidisciplinary approaches used for the medical decision making, particularly the use&#xD;
      of imaging studies, due to the fact that this are key factors in the stroke management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other factors that have contributed for the use of A.I. in stroke are the lack of experts for&#xD;
      the imaging diagnosis, this problem is clearly exacerbated in developing countries. Only a&#xD;
      few hospitals have access to specialized neuroradiologists or neurologist to provide an&#xD;
      opportune and optimal diagnosis, this generates a delay or even an inaccurate diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is even a variable concordance ranging up to 39% between specialized physicians for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of stroke in non-contrasted computed tomography in the medial cerebral artery&#xD;
      territory, this demonstrate the great inter-reader variability, furthermore there is sparse&#xD;
      definition of the characteristics of early infarct, demonstrating the need for a standardized&#xD;
      method of stroke imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of the A.I. systems in the stroke diagnosis,&#xD;
      most of them show that the automatized diagnosis with the A.I. is in the majority of the&#xD;
      times the same or even better than the manual segmentation with human diagnosis by stroke&#xD;
      experts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is even a stroke evaluation system already in the market, based on A.I. algorithms,&#xD;
      this has already demonstrated its utility in the ENCHANTED trial (Enhanced Control of&#xD;
      Hypertension and Thrombolysis Stroke Study), &quot;The Electronic-Alberta Stroke Program Early&#xD;
      Computed Tomography Score Software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUNDS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The A.I. has been defined as the study of the computations that make possible to perceive,&#xD;
      think and act. A.I. systems have focused to emulate the cognitive functions of the humans,&#xD;
      due to the rapidly advances in the computational sciences the A.I. is being used in multiple&#xD;
      fields, especially in big companies of information technology as google.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The precision medicine has been defined as the personalized diagnosis and treatment of an&#xD;
      individual patient, this is an emerging concept in the contemporary medicine. The great&#xD;
      number of information generated in biology, immunology, genomics and the advances in the&#xD;
      imaging technology has created the path to this personalized medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These advances have generated a transition in the modern healthcare models, propelled by the&#xD;
      great quantity of data and the advance of the analytic techniques. Guided by relevant&#xD;
      clinical questions, the A.I. systems can reveal valuable information hided within massive&#xD;
      amounts of data (big data), due to its analytic qualities. This can be helpful in the&#xD;
      clinical decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there are companies as I.B.M. and it's A.I. system Watson for Oncology (WFO),&#xD;
      developing Clinical Decision-Support Systems (CDSSs) in collaboration with hospitals as the&#xD;
      Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, this system pretends to help oncology specialist with&#xD;
      the current challenges of the great amount of data in fields as genetics, pharmacology and&#xD;
      treatment guidelines, analyzing big data bases for a more personalized treatment of the&#xD;
      patient. WFO was tested with real cases discussed in the multidisciplinary boards at the&#xD;
      Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center obtaining a great level of concordance in their&#xD;
      series, and currently is already available in the market.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of the systems of machine learning for the quantification, location and diagnosis of&#xD;
      ischemic stroke in non-contrasted head computed tomography, is a method with high efficacy,&#xD;
      accessible and susceptible for standardization, for the assistance in the clinical decision&#xD;
      making in the absence of specialized health personnel for the attention of this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Design an A.I. algorithm for the quantification, location and diagnosis of ischemic stroke&#xD;
      in non-contrasted head computed tomography, base in a hybrid model with the use of machine&#xD;
      learning and statistic modeling, evaluated its efficacy and create a software for the&#xD;
      assistance of medical decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standardize the data collection and the creation of data banks of non-contrasted head&#xD;
           computed tomography with ischemic stroke diagnosis for the inclusion into the A.I.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Create non-contrasted head computed tomography data bases with representative samples of&#xD;
           the different types of ischemic stroke, considering the multiple anatomical&#xD;
           distributions, sizes and evolution phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standardize an image segmentation method, location of the lesion, diagnosis and ASPECT&#xD;
           (Alberta Stroke Programme Early CT Score) scoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Generate an efficient software for the assistance of clinical decision making to&#xD;
           non-specialized medical staff in the diagnosis of this disease, in order to expedite the&#xD;
           medical care of this population of patients in places, where a lack of specialized teams&#xD;
           and technologic resources exists, for the diagnosis of this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technical Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standardize the collection of the anonymized non-contrasted head computed tomography&#xD;
           DICOM files with their respective system specifications (headers) for the creation of&#xD;
           the &quot;Ground Truth&quot; of the machine learning system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Create an efficient algorithm and evaluate its accuracy in the stroke diagnosis through&#xD;
           several pre-clinical tests with expert specialized physicians in cerebrovascular&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Design an interactive software and easy to use for the medical staff, for fast a&#xD;
           clinical decision making and with support on evidence-based medicine for patients with&#xD;
           suspicion of ischemic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GOALS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Create a software for the quantification, location and automatized diagnosis of stroke ,&#xD;
           that is efficient and accurate for the clinical decision making in the absence of&#xD;
           specialized medical staff and technological resources for the medical care of patients&#xD;
           with stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain the register of a patent of the machine learning based software.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Generate the publication of multiple articles in international journals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational prospective study, descriptive, without patient intervention, without blinding&#xD;
      for the analysis of the non-contrasted head computed tomography and its clinical correlation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study the confidentiality of the patient will be maintained, as the&#xD;
      investigators won't need the identification data from the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study the investigators pretend to create a hybrid A.I. model using a combined&#xD;
      method of statistic modeling for the first prototype of the algorithm and then continue with&#xD;
      the creation of the machine learning algorithm, combining both algorithms for a better&#xD;
      accuracy and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the first algorithm with statistic modeling the investigators pretend to obtain a&#xD;
      representative sample with the different types of ischemic stroke, until the investigators&#xD;
      collect 50 images, clinical information and its respective diagnosis and ASPECT score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuing with the prospective creation of a data base of computed tomography imaging,&#xD;
      clinical correlation, and their respective diagnosis and ASPECT score for the feeding of the&#xD;
      machine learning algorithm, that usually requires large quantities of data for its training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both algorithms the investigators pretend to test them with independent evaluators, whose&#xD;
      expertise will be on cerebrovascular disease, and the investigators will compare de results&#xD;
      of the A.I. system with the diagnosis of the specialized evaluators, in order to calibrate&#xD;
      the cut off points of the algorithm to obtain the maximal concordance .&#xD;
&#xD;
      INFRASTRUCTURE&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the developing of this protocol the investigators pretend to use the facilities of the&#xD;
      Department of Neurosciences form the Health Sciences Center of the University of Guadalajara&#xD;
      &quot;CUCS&quot;. The collection of the images will be done in collaboration with the Department of&#xD;
      radiology of the &quot;Hospital Civil de Guadalajara, Fray Antonio Alcalde&quot; and &quot;Hospital Civil de&#xD;
      Guadalajara, Juan I. Menchaca&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of the images will be performed in collaboration with the Neurology Department&#xD;
      of the &quot;Hospital Civil de Guadalajara, Fray Antonio Alcalde&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The creation of the A.I. algorithm will be done in collaboration with the University Center&#xD;
      of Engineering and Exact Sciences (CUCEI) from the University of Guadalajara, in the&#xD;
      department of computational sciences from CUCEI.&#xD;
