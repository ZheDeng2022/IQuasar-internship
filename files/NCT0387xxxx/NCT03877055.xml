    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and any good and bad side effects of&#xD;
      combining 2 study drugs, copanlisib and ibrutinib. This combination of drugs could shrink&#xD;
      your Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL), but it could also cause side effects. Both these drugs have&#xD;
      been given to people before, but this is the first time that they are being given together.&#xD;

    <description>Copanlisib is given intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of 28 day cycles. Ibrutinib is given orally every day on 28 days cycles. The maximum duration of treatment is 36 cycles not exceeding 36 months. In the phase II study, the cohort will expand and accrue patients at the recommended phase II dose of copanlisib and ibrutinib determined during phase I dose escalation. In a simon two stage mini-max design, an initial 18 patients will be enrolled, inclusive of 6 patients treated at MTD or RP2D from phase I study, in first stage.</description>
