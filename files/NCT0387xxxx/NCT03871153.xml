  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multi-institutional, single arm Phase II trial. All patients will be&#xD;
      treated with Carboplatin, Paclitaxel, Durvalumab and Radiation. All patients with non-PD&#xD;
      after induction therapy who remain surgical candidates will undergo surgical resection 4-12&#xD;
      weeks following induction therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgical resection, all patients who remain eligible will be treated with adjuvant&#xD;
      Durvalumab every 4 weeks for 6 cycles beginning 4-12 weeks after surgical resection.&#xD;
