      This trial will compare the application of Glass Ionomer Cement (GIC) sealant with&#xD;
      no-intervention for the most clinically- and cost-effective strategy for managing MIH molars&#xD;
      without post-eruptive breakdown, in a school setting, using low-technology and child-friendly&#xD;
      dental techniques. Methods/Design: This two-arm, parallel group, patient-randomized&#xD;
      controlled, superiority trial will have treatment provided in schools. Schoolchildren (age&#xD;
      6-9), presenting at least one MIH molar (n molars = 195,) will have random allocation to&#xD;
      treatment with or without the application of a GIC sealant (GC Fuji TRIAGE®, GC Europe,&#xD;
      Leuven, Belgium). Baseline measures and outcome data will be assessed through participant&#xD;
      report and clinical examination. The primary outcome is the presence of post-eruptive&#xD;
      fracture and development of caries lesions. Secondary outcomes are: (1) self-reported dental&#xD;
      hypersensitivity; (2) oral health-related-quality of life, reported by children; (3) plaque&#xD;
      index, (4) gingival health, (5) caries status (according to ICCMS scores) in primary and&#xD;
      permanent teeth; (6) the incremental cost-effectiveness. A trained and calibrated examiner&#xD;
      will evaluate the treated teeth every six months post treatment for a period of 36 months.&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression tests will be used to investigate the primary outcome. The&#xD;
      Logistic Regression and Poisson Regression Analysis will be used to analyze the secondary&#xD;
      outcomes (α=5%).&#xD;

      Background: Molar-Incisor Hypomineralisation (MIH) is defined as a qualitative defect that&#xD;
      occurs during the mineralization phase of enamel of at least one first permanent molar. The&#xD;
      opacities vary in size and color and are demarcated by healthy enamel. MIH molars present&#xD;
      lower mechanical properties when compared to non-affected molars, due to the enamel's&#xD;
      decreased mineralization. Allied to that, patients often report dental hypersensitivity,&#xD;
      which impairs the mechanical removal of dental plaque; therefore, those molars are more prone&#xD;
      to post-eruptive fractures and present higher risk of developing dental caries. This trial&#xD;
      will compare the application of Glass Ionomer Cement (GIC) sealant with no-intervention for&#xD;
      the most clinically- and cost-effective strategy for managing MIH molars without&#xD;
      post-eruptive breakdown, in a school setting, using low-technology and child-friendly dental&#xD;
      techniques. Methods/Design: This two-arm, parallel group, patient-randomized controlled,&#xD;
      superiority trial will have treatment provided in schools. Schoolchildren (age 6-9),&#xD;
      presenting at least one MIH molar (n molars = 195,) will have random allocation to treatment&#xD;
      with or without the application of a GIC sealant (GC Fuji TRIAGE®, GC Europe, Leuven,&#xD;
      Belgium). Baseline measures and outcome data will be assessed through participant report and&#xD;
      clinical examination. The primary outcome is the presence of post-eruptive fracture and&#xD;
      development of caries lesions. Secondary outcomes are: (1) self-reported dental&#xD;
      hypersensitivity; (2) oral health-related-quality of life, reported by children; (3) plaque&#xD;
      index, (4) gingival health, (5) caries status (according to ICCMS scores) in primary and&#xD;

      will evaluate the treated teeth every six months post treatment for a period of 36 months.&#xD;

    <description>The dental caries index ICCMS (Ismail et al., 2015) will be used. For that, a visual-tactile exam will be performed with the aid of an OMS probe.&#xD;

    <description>The sealants 'retention will be clinically evaluated and scored as: 0- fully retained sealant; 1- partially retained sealant and 2- sealant absent (Oba et al., 2009). (Hilgert LA et al., 2017)&#xD;

    <description>All children will be interviewed concerning their OHQoL by a local dentist. For that, the Child Perceptions Questionnaire (CPQ) will be used. This questionnaire has already been adapted and validated into Spanish-language (Carmen Aguilar-Díaz F et al., 2011).</description>

    <description>The cost-effectiveness analysis will take into account the direct and indirect costs of the procedures. The time spent in each session will be considered, with the total time spent timed by an external assistant. The numbers of consultations attended to each participant and the procedures performed will be registered.</description>

    <measure>Hypersensitivity</measure>
    <time_frame>hypersensitivity will be evaluated at 6-month intervals so that evaluations will be completed in 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months by the same examiner.</time_frame>
    <description>A questionnaire will be used which will be applied to children with specific questions, a) presence of hypersensitivity when ingesting hot and cold drinks; b) hypersensitivity when brushing teeth. Clinically it will be used the methodology used by Mehta D, et al., 2015. A cold air stimulus (2-s air blast, approximately 40 psi, from a dental syringe directed perpendicular to the molar surface at 0.5 cm distance). Neighboring teeth were shielded with cotton rolls or with the fingers of the examiner. Immediately after stimulation patients were asked to point to the g visual analog scale VAS scale (no pain = 0 and worst pain = 10 cm) to the nearest full centimeter number describing their pain perception. Brushing the child's teeth will identify if the child has hypersensitivity and the VAS is used in the same way.</description>
