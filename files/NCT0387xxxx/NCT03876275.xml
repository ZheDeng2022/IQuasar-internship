  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extended arthrodesis of the spine is indicated in the treatment of deformities. The principle&#xD;
      of the intervention is to correct the spinal imbalance and to obtain a fusion of the&#xD;
      vertebral segment operated in order to guarantee the durability of this correction, in order&#xD;
      to guarantee a functional result the best possible one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a great disparity in the techniques available to obtain this result: as regards the&#xD;
      correction of the deformation itself, it is possible to resort to various types of gestures&#xD;
      aimed at &quot;freeing&quot; the spine to allow the getting the correction. It may be staged or&#xD;
      transpedicular osteotomies or previous releases (staged discectomies). Regarding the&#xD;
      arthrodesis itself, this can be obtained by an isolated posterior graft or by a&#xD;
      circumferential graft itself performed in a time using interbody cages PLIF type (posterior&#xD;
      lumbar interbody fusion) or TLIF (transforaminal interbody fusion) or in two stages by a&#xD;
      complementary anterior graft. These are heavy interventions with a high complication rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The choice of this or that technique is based on data from the literature and remains at the&#xD;
      discretion of the surgeon who makes the surgical indication. However, it has never been&#xD;
      possible to compare these different techniques in a prospective study. The few articles&#xD;
      comparing the different techniques tend to show that there is no significant difference&#xD;
      between the techniques with a higher complication rate for the two-step techniques. However,&#xD;
      these are retrospective studies, with all the biases that this implies and despite these&#xD;
      results the disparity in surgical indications remains substantial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this work is therefore to evaluate, according to an identical protocol, the&#xD;
      different surgical techniques for the treatment of spinal deformities associated with a&#xD;
      fusion in order to determine the morbidity associated with each of the techniques and if this&#xD;
      morbidity is justified by a better functional result at a minimum follow-up of two years.&#xD;
