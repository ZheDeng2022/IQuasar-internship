    <textblock>
      This trial will be carried out in two stages in the sick baby room of the Children's Hospital&#xD;
      of China Medical University (CMUH). The first stage is: the enzyme active reaction kit&#xD;
      (usually called API ZYM kit) was used to determine the β-glucuronidase activity of 9 strains&#xD;
      of Lactobacillus and 4 strains of Bifidobacterium, screening out the probiotics that have the&#xD;
      best inhibitory efficacy of intestinal β-glucuronidase activity; The second stage is: using&#xD;
      the results of the first stage analysis, treating the newborns of jaundice by oral&#xD;
      probiotics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hyperbilirubinemia is one of the common diseases in neonates. According to the literature,&#xD;
      the incidence of neonatal jaundice is around 60~70% in Western countries, and even higher&#xD;
      among newborns of Asian ethnicity. There are many causes of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, one&#xD;
      of the important mechanisms is the lack of intestinal microbial flora, which causes high&#xD;
      level of conjugated bilirubin to be converted to unconjugated bilirubin via β-glucuronidase&#xD;
      in the intestine. The high level of unconjugated bilirubin will be absorbed or returned to&#xD;
      the blood via the enterohepatic circulation, resulting in jaundice. The main treatment of&#xD;
      neonatal jaundice is phototherapy: unconjugated bilirubin is converted to a non-toxic isomer&#xD;
      by blue light (wavelength 425-457 nm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, it has been confirmed that Escherichia coli (E. coli) in the intestine of animals&#xD;
      produces two harmful bacterial enzymes, β-glucosidase and β-glucuronidase. Therefore, in&#xD;
      recent years, scientists have used probiotics that inhibit the growth characteristics of&#xD;
      pathogenic bacteria to study the treatment of neonatal jaundice. Chen Yi-Ji et al. have shown&#xD;
      that probiotics inhibit the activity of intestinal β-glucuronidase, preventing the conversion&#xD;
      of conjugated bilirubin to unconjugated bilirubin, thereby reducing the level of unconjugated&#xD;
      bilirubin in the blood. Funda Tuzun et al.'s research indicates that bifidobacteria&#xD;
      probiotics prevent breast milk jaundice, and probiotics prevent jaundice by increasing&#xD;
      intestinal peristalsis and microbial flora. In addition, many studies have shown that&#xD;
      Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species have inhibitory efficacy on intestinal&#xD;
      β-glucuronidase activity, but there is no specific indication of which strain has the best&#xD;
      inhibitory efficacy. Based on the above research, the question investigators need to clarify&#xD;
      is whether oral probiotics can correct the intestinal microbial flora of newborns of&#xD;
      jaundice? Is there any difference in the improvement of neonatal jaundice by the addition of&#xD;
      probiotics in breast milk, formula or mixed milk? Therefore, this study will first screen out&#xD;
      the probiotics that have the best inhibitory efficacy of intestinal β-glucuronidase activity.&#xD;
      In the second stage, the results of the first stage will be used to perform a neonatal&#xD;
      jaundice oral probiotic double-blind randomized trial and the therapeutic efficacy will be&#xD;
      observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will be carried out in two stages in the sick baby room of the Children's Hospital&#xD;
      of China Medical University (CMUH). The first stage is: the API ZYM kit was used to determine&#xD;
      the β-glucuronidase activity of 9 strains of Lactobacillus and 4 strains of Bifidobacterium,&#xD;
      screening out the probiotics that have the best inhibitory efficacy of intestinal&#xD;
      β-glucuronidase activity; The second stage is: using the results of the first stage analysis,&#xD;
      treating the newborns of jaundice by oral probiotics. The inclusion criteria of jaundice&#xD;
      infants were as follows: the full-term infant (≧37 weeks) had a jaundice index greater than&#xD;
      15 mg/dl on the fourth day after birth, while neonates with hypothyroidism, trisomy 21,&#xD;
      maternal blood type A, B and O incompatibility, gastrointestinal disease, Glucose-6-Phosphate&#xD;
      Dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD deficiency), hemangioma, cephalhaematoma or hemorrhages,&#xD;
      severe asphyxia (stage III), fetal chromosomal anomalies, cyanotic congenital heart disease,&#xD;
      omphalocele, early onset sepsis or liver failure were excluded. The second stage of jaundice&#xD;
      newborns will be divided into three groups: (I. experimental group) light therapy +&#xD;
      Lactobacillus salivarius AP-32 (L. salivarius AP-32), (II. experimental group) light therapy&#xD;
      + Bifidobacterium Animalis subspecies Lactis CP-9 (B. Animalis subsp. Lactis CP-9), (III.&#xD;
      control group) light therapy + placebo. The study will be conducted for 7 days, the serum&#xD;
      bilirubin level will be measured by the same group of experienced nurses every day, and all&#xD;
      babies are monitored for adverse conditions such as vomiting, diarrhea or bloating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculation of sample size in the second stage: According to Chou Hung-Chieh et al.'s&#xD;
      research, the incidence of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia was 30.5% for a concentration ≧15&#xD;
      mg/dl. investigators assume that the experimental group has a 50% improvement compared with&#xD;
      the control group. If investigators allow 5% chance of type 1 error (α=0.05) and 10% chance&#xD;
      of type 2 error(β=0.1), then the required sample size in each group will be 60 people (total&#xD;
      180 babies).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research data will be based on statistical software (called IBM SPSS) for analytical&#xD;
      statistics. Normally distributed data were analyzed using Student's t-test two-tailed assay,&#xD;
      and non-normally distributed data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Data&#xD;
      were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SEM) or median, with P values &lt; 0.05 being&#xD;
      considered statistically significant.&#xD;
