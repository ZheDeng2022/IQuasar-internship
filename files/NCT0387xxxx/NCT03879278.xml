    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, single center, placebo-controlled, multiple&#xD;
      ascending dose (MAD) study in a maximum of 3 cohorts of 8 healthy male and female subjects&#xD;
      each. Subjects in Cohorts 1, 2 and 3 will receive ascending multiple IV doses of NPT189 or&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple dose, dose&#xD;
      escalation safety, tolerability and PK study of NPT189 in healthy subjects. Three dose&#xD;
      cohorts are planned each with a maximum of 8 subjects (6 active: 2 placebo) enrolled per&#xD;
      cohort. Eligible subjects will be administered NPT189 by IV infusions at the dose specified&#xD;
      for their cohort (i.e., 2 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, and 12.5 mg/kg) or a matching placebo. Subjects&#xD;
      will receive a total of 5 doses of NPT189, with doses administered at weekly intervals.&#xD;
      Safety and tolerability will be assessed by analysis of adverse events (AEs), vital signs,&#xD;
      electrocardiograms (ECG), laboratory and physical examinations. PK will be assessed by&#xD;
      analysis of serum NPT189 concentrations.&#xD;
