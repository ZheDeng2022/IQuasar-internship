    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is nowadays an important health problem and associated with high use of&#xD;
      resources and healthcare cost, but the prevalence of heart failure is increasing due to&#xD;
      better care and treatment of HF and to the aging of the population. Epidemiology of HF is&#xD;
      changing and shifting towards a higher prevalence of patients with HF with preserved ejection&#xD;
      fraction. Moreover, the outcome of HF is grim. The mortality rate is high and&#xD;
      hospitalizations are frequent and associated with worse outcomes. The majority of studies&#xD;
      that analyzed HF outcomes have focused on HF hospitalizations. However, in patients with HF,&#xD;
      all-cause hospitalizations can affect up to 23-58% of the patients at 1-year follow-up and&#xD;
      non-cardiovascular hospitalizations are associated with risk of subsequent mortality similar&#xD;
      to cardiovascular hospitalizations. Despite the evidence that all-cause hospitalizations are&#xD;
      detrimental in HF patients, few studies have analyzed whether the factors associated with&#xD;
      all-cause and HF-hospitalizations are different in HF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the characteristics and outcome of HF patients are not well described in developing&#xD;
      countries like Egypt. Documenting patients' characteristics and the outcome might improve&#xD;
      management of comorbidities associated with heart failure patients in Egypt as well as the&#xD;
      disease outcome, However, characteristics and outcome of HF patients are not well described&#xD;
      in developing countries like Egypt. Documenting patients' characteristics and the outcome&#xD;
