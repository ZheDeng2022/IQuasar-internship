    <textblock>
      This study is to be performed as an open label, multicenter, single arm study of 2X-121 to&#xD;
      evaluate anti-tumor efficacy of 2X-121 as single agent therapy in a 28-days cycle in advanced&#xD;
      ovarian cancer patients. 2X-121 will be supplied for oral administration once daily as 600 mg&#xD;
      (3 x 200 mg) capsules in a 28 days cycle. Patients with predicted high likelihood of&#xD;
      responding to the drug (2X-121) using drug response prediction (DRP®), will be included in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
