  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As a consequence of the impending increase in life expectancy, there is urgent need to adopt&#xD;
      life-saving interventions, such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, (SCT) in groups&#xD;
      of patients that have been regarded as unsuitable for such medical procedures owing to their&#xD;
      advanced age. However, a growing body of evidence shows that age per se does not account for&#xD;
      a reliable estimation of the capability of an individual to cope with the stressful procedure&#xD;
      of SCT and to deal with the cognate adverse effects. Recent literature shows that changes in&#xD;
      epigenetic markers (i.e. the extent of methylation) at specific loci of genomic DNA marks the&#xD;
      rate of aging and allows for the estimation of the so called &quot;biologic aging.&quot; In other&#xD;
      words, individuals of the same chronologic age may turn out to be older or younger respect&#xD;
      when their biologic age is assessed. This latter is expected to be tightly linked to changes&#xD;
      in major homeostatic mechanisms and consequently to be in relationship the chance of&#xD;
      successful SCT. The primary objective of the study is the study of DNA in patients undergoing&#xD;
      allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. DNA will be assessed for the extent of&#xD;
      methylation, which will be also in relationship with circulating exogenous DNA (i.e the&#xD;
      microbiome).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in groups of patients previously&#xD;
      unsuitable because of age is progressively increasing. Nowadays, allogeneic SCT in patients&#xD;
      aged over 60 years represents approximately 18%. In the European SCT database, the number of&#xD;
      patients aged &gt; 65 years was &lt;1% up to 2000 and 6.7% after 2000. This trend is the consequent&#xD;
      to a growing clinical need caused to the progressive global aging of general population and&#xD;
      to the increasing proportion of subjects with good performance status among elderly patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fitness to transplantation is currently measured by the absence of the major comorbidities&#xD;
      assessed by Sorror's Comorbidity Index score (HCT-CI). The score correlates with the outcome&#xD;
      after transplant and provides clear indications on the intensity of the chemotherapy to be&#xD;
      administered in pre-transplant phase in order to reduce Non Relapse Mortality (NRM).NRM is&#xD;
      the mortality not due to the recovery of the disease; it can arise from three orders of&#xD;
      complications: immunological (Graft versus Host Disease -GVHD-); infectious (opportunistic&#xD;
      infections) and toxic (organ toxicity related to chemotherapy). The intensity of conditioning&#xD;
      regimen is reduced consequently in presence of comorbidity and in the elderly patient, more&#xD;
      frequently affected by comorbidities. But reducing the intensity of conditioning regimen also&#xD;
      means significantly increasing the probability of relapse of haematological disease and&#xD;
      therefore this reduction must be made on the basis of indexes of aging and comorbidity, as&#xD;
      mentioned above (HCT-CI), in order to not overly reduce the curative potential of the&#xD;
      transplant.This study aims to apply innovative markers of biological age for the evaluation&#xD;
      of SCT patients. Biological age assessment is a rapidly expanding research area that has&#xD;
      produced very promising results. Biological age is an index composed of molecular markers&#xD;
      (such as DNA methylation of nucleated blood cells or the level of glycans associated with&#xD;
      circulating proteins); it is strongly related to chronological age, but is capable of&#xD;
      expressing the speed of aging of the single subject and consequently is able to highlight the&#xD;
      risks for health associated with aging, with more emphasis than chronological age. The recent&#xD;
      literature clearly indicates that DNA is also present in the non-cellular fraction, in the&#xD;
      form of free DNA that it is largely contained in the compartment of nanovesicles. In&#xD;
      particular, it is interesting to study if nanovesicles DNA can provide useful data regarding&#xD;
      the epigenome and to verify how the epigenome is linked with the presence of exogenous DNA,&#xD;
      that is the microbiome.This entity includes all the bacterial and viral species that coexist&#xD;
      with every human, mostly located in the gastrointestinal tract, and which are increasingly&#xD;
      determining to understand the pathogenesis of inflammatory and/or metabolic diseases, as well&#xD;
      as the biological bases of aging. In this regard, the recent literature shows a close&#xD;
      relationship between GVHD, viroma and intestinal microbiome.Epigenetics does not specifically&#xD;
      deal with the modification of the sequence of the subject's DNA but with all the regulatory&#xD;
      processes that influence gene expression. In particular, methylation is an epigenetic&#xD;
      modification of DNA. Therefore, epigenetic studies differ from classical genetic studies in&#xD;
      which the analysis of the exact DNA sequence of the subjects is carried out. In this&#xD;
      protocol, the investigators will refer to the &quot;study of DNA&quot; as the study of its&#xD;
      modifications in the methylation status and not in its sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Study of DNA in samples of patients undergoing allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation. In particular, DNA will be extracted from leukocytes and plasma&#xD;
      extracellular nanovesicles. DNA will be assessed for the extent of methylation, which will be&#xD;
      also in relationship with circulating exogenous DNA (i.e the microbiome).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study of DNA in urine and faeces samples of the same subjects to describe further&#xD;
           elements of the systemic microbiome - namely the urinary virome and the intestinal&#xD;
           microbiome-.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlation of circulating epigenome and systemic microbiome with clinical outcomes&#xD;
           (overall survival, GVHD, incidence of infections) and comorbidity index (HCT-CI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Absence of signed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No treatment is provided; patients will be treated and followed according to normal clinical&#xD;
      practice and according to international guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The visits and evaluations are those of routine practice will not be modified. Samples of&#xD;
      different biological materials will be taken at the start of recovery, at day -1, +1, and&#xD;
      after 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 months after transplantation. After discharge, all patients will be&#xD;
      followed as usual by the Day Hospital of the Transplant Unit of the Hematology Institute,&#xD;
      where the prospective collection of samples at defined times will continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is descriptive. The evaluation of the main clinical&#xD;
      variables is done with descriptive analysis (mean, median, range, etc.). Survival analysis&#xD;
      will be performed according to Kaplan-Meier methodology for censored data. Regression&#xD;
      analysis for censored data will be performed using Cox proportional risk models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DNA methylation is expressed in terms of continuous variables, as a percentage of&#xD;
      methylation of the different analyzed gene loci. The analysis of methylation data will be&#xD;
      performed through a pipeline of algorithms developed by the proponents. The viromic data are&#xD;
      nominal variables (presence/absence of viral species).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is of exploratory nature and it is expected to enroll 50 patients.&#xD;
