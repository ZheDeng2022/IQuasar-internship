  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Family Planning Elevated (FPE) is a statewide contraceptive initiative with two primary aims:&#xD;
      1) supporting existing and proposed legislative policy that expands family planning services&#xD;
      in Utah among low-income individuals covered by contraceptive legislation (currently&#xD;
      individuals at ≤100% federal poverty) and 2) demonstrating additional existing service need&#xD;
      among low-income individuals who currently fall in the contraceptive coverage gap (101%-250%&#xD;
      federal poverty). Family Planning Elevated provides contraceptive grants, education and&#xD;
      training, and technical assistance on comprehensive contraceptive care to participating&#xD;
      clinics. The purpose of this evaluation is to assess the effect of FPE on clinic-level family&#xD;
      planning service delivery among 1) low-income women at ≤100% federal poverty, and 2)&#xD;
      low-income women who fall in the contraceptive coverage gap (currently 101-250% federal&#xD;
      poverty) compared to matched control clinics which did not receive the intervention. To&#xD;
      assess these effects, FPE will collect monthly family planning service delivery data from&#xD;
      both intervention and control clinics, beginning 12 months prior to the FPE intervention, and&#xD;
      following for 12 months after the FPE intervention ends. A difference-in-difference analysis&#xD;
      will compare trends and level-changes in family planning services provided to intervention&#xD;
      and control groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intervention clinics (FPE Contraceptive Access Program [FPE CAP]) receive a multifaceted&#xD;
      contraceptive intervention, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Training and technical assistance on contraceptive counseling and provision for FPE CAP&#xD;
           providers, administrators, and health center support staff. FPE CAP staff will be&#xD;
           required to attend an annual contraceptive training conference and receive additional&#xD;
           remote and on-site technical support on counseling and provision of contraceptive&#xD;
           methods. Methods include emergency contraception, oral contraceptive pills,&#xD;
           contraceptive patch, vaginal ring, contraceptive injection, fertility awareness methods,&#xD;
           condoms, contraceptive implant, hormonal IUDs, and non-hormonal IUD and other&#xD;
           contraceptive methods, as feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. FPE will provide FPE CAP members a cash grant to offset personnel and equipment costs&#xD;
           associated with FPE CAP start-up and implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Monthly reimbursement for FPE CAP contraceptive services. As a result of the Medicaid&#xD;
           Family Planning Waiver effective January 1, 2019, Utah health centers may claim Medicaid&#xD;
           reimbursement for contraceptive services provided to Medicaid enrolled clients at ≤100%&#xD;
           Federal Poverty Level. FPE CAP seeks to expand this coverage by providing reimbursement&#xD;
           to FPE CAP health centers for contraceptive services provided to clients at 101% - 250%&#xD;
           FPL (or 0% - 250% FPL for undocumented clients). Clients must be of reproductive age&#xD;
           seeking female-user dependent methods and not be eligible for Medicaid/PCN.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Contraceptive method stock. The high upfront cost of some contraceptive methods,&#xD;
           particularly IUDs and implants, is often a barrier for health centers to maintain&#xD;
           adequate contraceptive inventory. During the FPE CAP project period, members will be&#xD;
           provided a stock of IUDs and implants to provide to eligible FPE CAP clients. Health&#xD;
           centers will be also be reimbursed or provided vouchers for short-acting methods&#xD;
           including oral contraceptive pills, vaginal rings, contraceptive injections, condoms,&#xD;
           cycle beads, and emergency contraception. FPE will provide technical assistance to&#xD;
           members to build a sustainable inventory of contraceptive methods for the post-FPE CAP&#xD;
           project period. This will include training on drug forecasting and stocking, 340B Drug&#xD;
           Discount Program, group purchasing organizations, and patient assistance programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Evaluative Support: FPE CAP members will be responsible for providing routine data to&#xD;
           FPE to help us assess the impact of the program. As part of this effort, FPE CAP members&#xD;
           will receive evaluative support in developing and reporting data requirements both for&#xD;
           the program and to fill existing clinical data needs around contraception. Additionally,&#xD;
           data provided to the FPE team will be analyzed and returned back to the individual&#xD;
           health centers as part of the dissemination strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Marketing campaign: FPE will produce a targeted media campaign to increase public&#xD;
           awareness of expanded eligibility for contraceptive services, improve demand for&#xD;
           contraceptive services at community health centers, and provide client education on&#xD;
           available contraceptive options. FPE will support FPE CAP members by creating customized&#xD;
           media campaigns for community outreach and education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control clinics are similar clinics (matched by clinic size, geography, and serving Medicaid&#xD;
      clients) who are not interested in participating in Family Planning Elevated, but are willing&#xD;
      to provide the monthly service delivery data for the same time periods as their matched&#xD;
      intervention clinic.&#xD;
