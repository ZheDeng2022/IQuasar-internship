  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to investigate and compare the reduction in (1) soft tissue inflammation and&#xD;
      (2) amount of plaque accumulation at implant sites with (test) or without (control) patient&#xD;
      administered use of single tufted brush.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratified randomized single blinded clinical controlled trial with 2 parallel arms is&#xD;
      designed to achieve the aims of this research project. Study participants will be enrolled&#xD;
      from NUH University Dental Cluster. They will be randomly assigned into the test (toothbrush,&#xD;
      interdental brush, and single tufted brush) and control (toothbrush and interdental brush)&#xD;
      groups and reviewed at 2 weeks (± 3 days), 4 weeks (± 3 days), 3 months (± 7 days), and 6&#xD;
      months (± 7 days).&#xD;

      There are two study phases during the whole course of the study. PHASE 1: EXAMINER&#xD;
      CALIBRATION Examiner will be calibrated before the study period with 10 volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intra-examiner reliability will be assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient. The&#xD;
      volunteers will be recruited based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Probing pocket depths (PPD) at 6 sites per implant ii. mBI at 6 sites per implant iii. mPI&#xD;
      at 8 sites per implant Clinical parameters (i) to (iii) will be performed at day 0 and day 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE 2: STUDY INTERVENTION Study participants who are visiting University Dental Cluster or&#xD;
      any other dental clinics or hospitals will be referred for this study. They will be enrolled&#xD;
      at NUH University Dental Cluster if they fulfill the inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test: Subjects in this group will receive a single tufted brush and interdental brushes&#xD;
           of an appropriate size that will fit the interdental spaces around the implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control: Subjects in this group will only receive interdental brushes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will be randomly assigned into either test or control group based on a&#xD;
      computer generated randomization code after screening of inclusion and exclusion criteria and&#xD;
      signing of informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding and Allocation Concealment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study examiner who will be doing the clinical examination and collecting the study data&#xD;
      will be blinded to the group allocation; however it is not possible to blind the study&#xD;
      subjects to the group allocation. The clinician, who will be performing the treatment and&#xD;
      providing oral hygiene instructions, will be given a sequentially numbered envelope&#xD;
      containing the subject's group allocation after non-surgical periodontal therapy has been&#xD;
      performed and before giving the oral hygiene instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Probing pocket depths (PPD) (6 points per implant) ii. mBI (6 points per implant) iii. mPI&#xD;
      (8 points per implant) iv. Characteristics of the implant and implant crown: tissue level or&#xD;
      bone level, supraor submucosal margin, degree of overcontour as seen on periapical radiograph&#xD;
      v. Peri-apical radiograph of implant taken with parallel technique Clinical parameters (i) to&#xD;
      (iii) will be performed at baseline, 2-weeks, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months post&#xD;
      instrumentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical parameter (iv) and (v) will be performed at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peri-apical radiographs will be taken with paralleling technique to determine that there is&#xD;
      peri-implant bone loss beyond 2mm at baseline.&#xD;
