      The objective of this study is to assess the safety and feasibility of allogeneic adipose&#xD;
      tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) injected into the lacrimal gland in a smaller&#xD;
      groups of 7 patients with Aqueous Deficient Dry Eye Disease (ADDE)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye disease (DED) is a very common problem seen in patients all over the world. According&#xD;
      to an older study the prevalence of DED in a Danish population 30-60 years of age was 11%.&#xD;
      Aqueous tear deficient dry eye (ADDE) is a subtype of DED in which the tear production in the&#xD;
      lacrimal gland (LG) is impaired. Current treatment of ADDE is only to relieve symptoms as a&#xD;
      curative treatment of ADDE does not exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) reside in almost all connective tissues and are multipotent&#xD;
      stem cells with the capacity to differentiate into several kinds of tissue. Several studies&#xD;
      have shown that MSCs reduces inflammation in various diseases. Adipose tissue-derived MSCs&#xD;
      (ASCs) have gained considerable attention, since they are readily available from the&#xD;
      abdominal fat where it is most easily collected and expanded. In resting MSCs, MHC class II&#xD;
      is not expressed on the surface, which reduces the inherent immunogenicity of the cells. This&#xD;
      supreme attribute allows allogeneic MSC transplantation. Treatment with allogeneic MSCs have&#xD;
      been investigated in an extensive number of human subjects for various conditions in clinical&#xD;
      trials and no documented adverse events related to an anti-donor immune response exist. One&#xD;
      potential advantage of treatment with allogeneic cells is the possibility of their use as an&#xD;
      &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; therapeutic agent, avoiding the need for tissue collection and culture to&#xD;
      delay and increase the cost of treatment. It has also been suggested that the function of&#xD;
      autologous MSCs could be impaired in patients with comorbidities or advanced age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In canines as in humans the most common cause of ADDE is an immune-mediated inflammatory&#xD;
      response targeting the LG. Two studies with injection of allogeneic ASCs from healthy donors&#xD;
      in a total of 48 eyes in 27 canines with ADDE have been performed with a significant increase&#xD;
      in tear production and no observed adverse events to the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies with injection of ASCs into the human LG has never been conducted. This present study&#xD;
      will test the hypothesis that injection of allogeneic ASCs into the LG in patients suffering&#xD;
      from ADDE is safe and increases tear production and reduces inflammation resulting in&#xD;
      increased ocular comfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7 patients with severe ADDE from Dept. of Ophthalmology, Rigshospitalet-Glostrup, will be&#xD;
      recruited if they are 1: eligible for the study and 2: sign the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At inclusion the participants will fill out the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI)&#xD;
      questionnaire and undergo an eye examination in the following order:&#xD;
&#xD;
      measurement of tear osmolarity (TearLab™), tear break-up time (TBUT), ocular surface staining&#xD;
      according to the Ocular SICCA Grading Score, and Schirmer's I test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a maximum of 14 days from screening all participants will receive an injection with&#xD;
      ASCs into the lacrimal gland on one eye. If both eyes fulfill the eligibility criteria the&#xD;
      most affected eye with the lowest tear production assessed with the Schirmer's I test will be&#xD;
      the study eye; the contralateral eye will not be treated but examined according to the same&#xD;
      protocol as the study eye at each follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The product used is CSCC_ASC(22) and the dose injected contains approximately 11 million ASCs&#xD;
      per LG in a suspension with a total volume of 0.5 ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 week (±2 days), 4 weeks (±4 days), and 4 months (±7 days) after intervention the&#xD;
      participants are followed up with eye examination as described above, OSDI questionnaire, and&#xD;
      blood test. At 4 months the primary outcomes of safety will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of trial is defined as last participant's last visit (LPLV) at 3 years late follow-up.&#xD;
