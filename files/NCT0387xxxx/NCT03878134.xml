      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computed Tomography (CT) scans use x-rays to make three-dimensional images of the body. A new&#xD;
      type of CT scanner, called a photon counting CT, measures the x-rays differently than a&#xD;
      standard scanner. Researchers want to see if the new scanner can provide better images at a&#xD;
      lower x-ray dose. They also want to compare the new images and technique to the standard CT&#xD;
      scan images and techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test a new type of CT scanner, called a photon counting CT, to see if it provides better&#xD;
      images at a lower x-ray dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older who are scheduled for a CT scan as part of their standard care at&#xD;
      the NIH Clinical Center&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a collection and review of their medical records. Women of&#xD;
      child bearing age will provide blood and urine samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants past imaging data and studies done after the photon counting CT scan may be&#xD;
      collected, analyzed, and compared to the CT scans performed in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have CT scans. During the test, they will lie on a padded table. The table&#xD;
      will slide into a donut-shaped machine. An x-ray tube will move around the body, taking many&#xD;
      pictures as it rotates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be in the CT scan machine for about 20 minutes. The CT scans requested by&#xD;
      the participant s healthcare team will be performed. One CT scan with the new technology will&#xD;
      also be performed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      NIH develops new imaging techniques as one of its priorities for accelerating science,&#xD;
      including methods for non-invasive patient assessments. Computed tomographic (CT) imaging is&#xD;
      a mainstay of diagnostic imaging. The latest major technological advance is photon counting&#xD;
      CT (PCCT) which uses a new x-ray detector that measures x-ray penetration of the body and the&#xD;
      energy of each x-ray photon. NIH has one of three prototype Siemens PCCT CounT systems in the&#xD;
      world for investigational use. The scanner can perform standard CT and PCCT imaging. In this&#xD;
      protocol, NIH patients already enrolled in a clinical research protocol and who are referred&#xD;
      to Radiology for diagnostic CT as part of that research may be enrolled in this study of&#xD;
      PCCT. The diagnostic CT scan requested by their medical care team will be performed on the&#xD;
      CounT scanner, providing the clinically indicated imaging, along with a single, brief PCCT&#xD;
      exam to support PCCT development. The data will be used to characterize quality of the PCCT&#xD;
      images and to develop testable hypotheses and new diagnostic applications using PCCT&#xD;
      capabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current CT systems, such as the Siemens SOMATOM Flash, have two x-ray tubes, each paired with&#xD;
      an x-ray detector that measures total x-ray penetration of the patient and uses that&#xD;
      information to create the images. The CounT scanner is a modified version of the Flash in&#xD;
      which one of the two standard detectors has been replaced with a PCCT detector. The two&#xD;
      imaging modes for the CounT scanner are (i) standard detector study as in a Flash scanner and&#xD;
      (ii) PCCT scan. The patient scan will thus include clinically indicated radiation exposure&#xD;
      with the standard detector and research radiation with the PCCT detector. The CounT system is&#xD;
      sited at the Clinical Center under a CRADA with Siemens Medical Solutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to current scanners, PCCT offers four major advantages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  lower radiation dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  greater spatial resolution&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reduced imaging noise&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  x-ray energy discrimination&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  develop and characterize new medical imaging methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  facilitate translation of PCCT advantages into clinically useful applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a translational development protocol, all imaging studies are open-label and data may be&#xD;
      analyzed as they are collected. Bias is minimized using objective measurements. Observational&#xD;
      data may be characterized using descriptive statistics. Simple comparisons between the&#xD;
      standard CT and PCCT may use paired and unpaired parametric and non-parametric techniques.&#xD;
      These studies will form the foundation to develop advanced clinical imaging capabilities and&#xD;
      applications.&#xD;
