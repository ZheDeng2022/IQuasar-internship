  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research applies the highly innovative technology of real-time functional&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rtfMRI) to examine plasticity of brain-regulatory mechanisms&#xD;
      related to cognitive and affective processing and to determine benefits for cognition and&#xD;
      affect in young and older adults and in Parkinson Disease (PD) patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is increasing evidence that age-related alterations in brain function associated with&#xD;
      affective processing and attention contribute to these motivational and emotional changes&#xD;
      with age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these theoretical considerations as well as the previous study's data, the proposed&#xD;
      research will apply well-tested emotion processing and attention paradigms to address the&#xD;
      pivotal question of whether brain activity can be modulated in healthy aging and PD (in the&#xD;
      substudy) via contingent rt-fMRI neurofeedback and whether this neuroregulatory modulation&#xD;
      increases emotion processing and cognitive performance.&#xD;

    <description>Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Participants in each group will be trained using functional magnetic resonance imaging to regulation brain activity in primary auditory cortex. The primary auditory cortex is a brain region that is NOT specifically involved in emotion processing. Activation of this region is NOT expected to improve emotion processing; and thus activation of this brain region serves as &quot;control/placebo&quot; condition in the current design (placebo comparator).</description>
