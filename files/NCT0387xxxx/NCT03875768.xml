    <textblock>
      The goal of Nourish is to help adults with high blood pressure enjoy an eating pattern called&#xD;
      DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) to lower blood pressure and improve health.&#xD;
      Nourish will use a mobile app and information about DASH to help study participants follow&#xD;
      the DASH dietary plan by tracking what they eat and drink every day. The primary outcome of&#xD;
      the study is 6-month change in following the DASH eating plan, as measured by 24-hour dietary&#xD;
      recalls. The secondary outcome is change in blood pressure. Study participation will last one&#xD;
      year.&#xD;

      Over 100 million Americans suffer from high blood pressure and are at increased risk for&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. Evidence supports the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension)&#xD;
      dietary pattern to reduce blood pressure. DASH is rich in fruits and vegetables, legumes,&#xD;
      lean protein, and low-fat dairy, and reduced in red meats, sweets and processed foods. The&#xD;
      Nourish trial will look at the effect of the intervention on changes in dietary quality and&#xD;
      blood pressure among men and women with high blood pressure. Participants who join Nourish&#xD;
      will be asked to track what they eat and drink every day through a smartphone app and to&#xD;
      participate in online study visits. Some participants will also receive additional support&#xD;
      from a registered dietitian. We are doing this study to understand how technology can help&#xD;
      adults with high blood pressure follow a heart-healthy eating plan to improve their blood&#xD;
      pressure.&#xD;
