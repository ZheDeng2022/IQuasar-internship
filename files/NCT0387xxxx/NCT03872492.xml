    <textblock>
      Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a debilitating disease characterized by a depressed mood,&#xD;
      diminished interests, impaired cognitive function and vegetative symptoms, such as disturbed&#xD;
      sleep or appetite. MDD occurs about twice as often in women than it does in men and affects&#xD;
      about 6% of the adult population worldwide each year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard symptoms scales like the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale or the Montgomery-asberg&#xD;
      Depression Rating Scale, the Self-Report 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology&#xD;
      were initially developed for the evaluation of a therapeutic intervention or a&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment and are routinely used by clinicians in the assessment of Treatment&#xD;
      Resistant Depression (TRD) occurrence. In parallel, patient-reported outcomes have gained&#xD;
      increasing importance and are widely recommended by health authorities in the assessment of&#xD;
      depression. The same institutions insist on the collection of real-world data to provide&#xD;
      clinicians with ecological measurements. It has been demonstrated that an early response to&#xD;
      an AntiDepressant (AD) treatment can be seen as early as week 2 and is not related to a&#xD;
      placebo-effect. While there is no consensus on the exact cut-off values, several factors&#xD;
      emerge as early predictors of a later treatment response, such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improvement in emotional processing of happy facial expressions after 1 week of&#xD;
           treatment,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Circa 20% improvement in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 item (HDRS-17) at week 2.&#xD;
           The hypothesis is therefore that repeated, systematic and real-time, contextualized and&#xD;
           multimodal collection of depressive symptoms from patients at home will establish a&#xD;
           threshold score that can predict a subsequent response to their treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REDRESS was inspired by several standard depression scales used and recommended by the French&#xD;
      Health Authority, augmented with digital active and passive activity monitoring, speech&#xD;
      analysis and emotional processing assessment. Another important assumption is that honesty&#xD;
      and willingness to disclose personal or embarrassing things will be best achievable via a&#xD;
      digital solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this assumption, the overall scores and each subscores on the REDRESS numerical scale&#xD;
      will be compared in people with MDD showing adequate response to those showing insufficient&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The response to treatment at week 6 will be studied (end of Phase 1). Non-responders and&#xD;
      responders to the first treatment round will be enrolled in a 6-week extension phase (Phase&#xD;
      2). Non-responders will receive another treatment course (Other AD, combination, etc.).&#xD;
      Responders will just be followed up and will keep the same treatment. The REDRESS scores will&#xD;
      be analysed in this population and will allow us to test the investigator's assumption in&#xD;
      people with treatment resistant depression. This study will also allow to assess patients'&#xD;
      quality of life at the end of each phase of treatment and to compare results with REDRESS&#xD;
      scores.&#xD;

Scores between 10 and 20 are associated with significant functional impairment but less severe clinical symptomatology. Scores below 10 appears to be associated with subclinical populations.
