  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic surgery has not changed much in safety compared with open surgery through many&#xD;
      existing studies, and has become a procedure to help patients' recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, laparoscopic surgery has been actively performed for pancreaticoduodenectomy, one&#xD;
      of the most complicated procedures in intraperitoneal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the investigators will perform a prospective study to establish a higher level of evidence&#xD;
      for the efficacy and safety of laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study was to compare the short-term clinical outcomes including the&#xD;
      functional recovery after surgery, complications and confirm that laparoscopic&#xD;
      pancreaticoduodenectomy is safe and appropriate. This study includes an interim analysis and&#xD;
      can be terminated early by analysis at the completion of 50% of planned patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Pancreatoduodenectomy is a standard procedure for periampullary disease of the duodenum&#xD;
           (pancreatic cancer, biliary pancreatic cancer, bile duct cancer, etc.) and is a very&#xD;
           extensive and complicated operation for partial resection of the pancreas, duodenum,&#xD;
           bile duct, gallbladder and occasionally stomach. In addition, anastomotic anastomoses&#xD;
           are considered to be one of the most complicated surgeries among intraperitoneal&#xD;
           procedures, even in open surgery. Laparoscopic surgery has been advancing rapidly with&#xD;
           the development of the technique of laparoscopic surgery. In recent years,&#xD;
           Pancreatoduodenectomy has been actively attempting laparoscopic surgery centering on&#xD;
           large organs. As a result, large incision and abdominal wall traction can be avoided.&#xD;
           Common advantages include postoperative pain relief, rapid recovery of bowel movements,&#xD;
           fewer days of hospitalization, and a quick return to daily life. In addition, recently&#xD;
           reported meta-analysis has shown that laparoscopic Pancreatoduodenectomy has a&#xD;
           significantly lower bleeding volume and duration of hospitalization compared to open&#xD;
           surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study was aimed to compared functional recovery between open and laparoscopic PD in&#xD;
           3 tertiary referral centers in Korea. The investigators will measure functional recovery&#xD;
           .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A case of pancreaticoduodenectomy with benign tumor in the pancreas will be included.&#xD;
           The expected number of patients is 252. The laparoscopic surgery was performed in the&#xD;
           experimental group and the open surgery was performed in the control group. When&#xD;
           achieving 50% of the planned target group, the interim analysis will decide whether to&#xD;
           continue the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical study is a randomized prospective comparative study of the outcome of&#xD;
      laparoscopic and open Pancreatoduodenectomy, and the research hypothesis is as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nursing Hypothesis: There is no difference in the functional recovery between patients&#xD;
           who underwent laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy and patients who underwent open&#xD;
           surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alternative Hypothesis: Based on the results of the same operation of the existing&#xD;
           institution, the average functional recovery for open pancreaticoduodenectomy is&#xD;
           estimated to be 14 days, and the functional recovery for laparoscopic&#xD;
           pancreaticoduodenectomy is reduced by 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The random assignment of this study is assigned according to the order of assignment in the&#xD;
      planning stage of the study as a block randomization scheme with appropriate block size set.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plan for recruitment of research subjects All patients who underwent&#xD;
           pancreaticoduodenectomy for the pancreas or peripapillary lesion were selected and&#xD;
           selected as subjects after explaining the study and accepting consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Operative methods Both patients underwent conventional pancreaticoduodenectomy or&#xD;
           pyloric preservation pancreaticoduodenectomy. In the control group, the midline incision&#xD;
           was performed and the operation was performed by the laparotomy. In the experimental&#xD;
           group, laparoscopic surgery was performed using 5-6 trocars. Laparoscopy and laparotomy&#xD;
           are performed through the same surgical procedure and the procedure is as follows.&#xD;
           Kocher maneuver is performed to mobilize the duodenum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Omentectomy is performed and the gastrocolic truck is identified and ligated. The stomach or&#xD;
      duodenum is cut off using an automatic stapler. A cholecystectomy is performed. The bile duct&#xD;
      is cut and the frozen section is checked to confirm whether the tumor is invaded. The hepatic&#xD;
      and hepatic arteries are dissected and the surrounding lymph nodes are dissected. The&#xD;
      gastroduodenal artery is detached and ligated. The pancreas is cut from the pancreas neck,&#xD;
      and the tumor is examined by freezing biopsy. The proximal plant is dissected and cut, and&#xD;
      the pancreas uncinate process is released from the superior mesenteric artery and vein.&#xD;
      Pancreaticojejunal anastomosis, hepaticojejunal anastomosis, gastrojejunal or duodenojejunal&#xD;
      anastomosis are performed. In this case, anastomosis is performed by the method used by each&#xD;
      institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indications for open conversion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In a situation where the safety of the patient is threatened, it is possible to switch&#xD;
           to the opener at any time under the judgment of the researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vascular involvement of the superior mesenteric vein, superior mesenteric artery, and&#xD;
           hepatic artery is suspected and the operation is difficult to perform.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The operation is difficult due to severe pancreatitis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laparoscopic treatment is difficult if there is bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient management after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 day after surgery: Removal of blood and nasogastric tube after surgery, water intake,&#xD;
           early gait, cytokine check&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 days after surgery: initiation or death, cytokine check&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 days after surgery: intravenous patient controlled analgesia removal, after 3 days,&#xD;
           considering drain amylase and drain volume can be removed. Check functional recovery&#xD;
           daily after 3 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5 days after surgery: Perform computed tomography.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  7 days after surgery: If the patient is a malignant tumor, the tumor marker will be&#xD;
           collected. Cytokine check&#xD;
