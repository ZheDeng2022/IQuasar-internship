    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria (Imaging):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a target intracranial aneurysm located in the internal carotid artery (up&#xD;
             to the terminus).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a target intracranial aneurysm with an aneurysm neck ≥4mm or a&#xD;
             dome-to-neck ratio of &lt; 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a target intracranial aneurysm that has a parent vessel with diameter&#xD;
             1.5-5.0 mm distal/proximal to the target intracranial aneurysm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria (Clinical):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject (or subject's legally authorized representative) has provided written informed&#xD;
             consent using the IRB and Medtronic approved Informed Consent Form and agrees to&#xD;
             comply with protocol requirements. HIPAA/data protection authorization has been&#xD;
             provided and signed by the subject (or subject's legally authorized representative).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 22-80 years at the time of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy ≥3 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a mRS ≤ 2 at baseline to be determined by a certified independent assessor&#xD;
             at the site.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject's last recorded P2Y12 reaction units (PRU) value is between ≥60 and ≤200 prior&#xD;
             to study procedure. For OUS sites, a Thromboelastogram (TEG) test may be carried out&#xD;
             instead of the PRU test (depending on PRU test availability). In cases where TEG test&#xD;
             is carried out, the subject should have a pre-procedure therapeutic ADP% between &gt;30%&#xD;
             to &lt;90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has multiple increased risk factors for intracranial aneurysm rupture,&#xD;
             including but not limited to, aneurysm morphology, smoking, hypertension, diabetes,&#xD;
             age, prior and/or family history of rupture, and/or history of subarachnoid hemorrhage&#xD;
             that may result in a benefit risk profile of endovascular treatment to outweigh the&#xD;
             risks of intracranial aneurysm rupture during the subject's expected lifetime if left&#xD;
             untreated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria (Imaging):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has internal carotid artery bifurcation aneurysm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aneurysms that arise from the Posterior Communicating Artery (PComm).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The internal carotid artery aneurysms of the C7 segment will be excluded under the&#xD;
             following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Observed fetal posterior communicating artery (PComm) of fetal origin (A PComm of&#xD;
                  fetal origin is defined as a small, hypoplastic, or absent P1 segment of the&#xD;
                  posterior cerebral artery (PCA) with the PComm artery supplying a majority of&#xD;
                  blood flow to the P2 and higher order segments of the PCA)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. PComm overlapping with the aneurysm neck&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. PComm branch arising from the dome of the aneurysm&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has aneurysm arising from internal carotid artery but is primarily fed by&#xD;
             posterior circulation (i.e., retrograde flow from the basilar artery) as confirmed by&#xD;
             DSA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria (Clinical):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject requires treatment of another aneurysm (with another treatment modality)&#xD;
             within the affected territory of the target aneurysm during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has received an intracranial implant (e.g. coils) in the area of the target&#xD;
             intracranial aneurysm within the past 6 months prior to the study procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has had a SAH and/or target aneurysm rupture in the past 30 days prior to the&#xD;
             study procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has undergone a surgery including endovascular procedures in the last 30 days&#xD;
             prior to the study procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aneurysm vessel characteristics (e.g. parent vessel stenosis, irregular morphology)&#xD;
             that would preclude the device from fully confirming to the parent vessel to reduce&#xD;
             any risk of embolic complications, retreatment, or device movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has active vasospasm, malignant brain tumor or vascular malformation (e.g.&#xD;
             arteriovascular malformation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of major bleeding disorder (based on coagulation profile and platelet count)&#xD;
             and/or subject presents with signs of active bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject requires adjunctive device use (e.g. coils) during the index procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has extradural target aneurysm &lt;12mm which is not symptomatic or not&#xD;
             exhibiting aneurysm growth (exception: unless it is a fusiform aneurysm &lt;12 mm i.e.,&#xD;
             asymptomatic extradural fusiform aneurysms &lt;12 mm can be included).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any known contraindication to treatment with the Pipeline™ Vantage Embolization Device&#xD;
             with Shield Technology™, or use of antiplatelet therapy including:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Active bacterial infection&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Contraindication to DAPT agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-existing stent is in place in the parent artery at the target intracranial&#xD;
             aneurysm location&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelet count &lt; 100 x 10^3 cells/mm^3 or known platelet dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The Investigator determines that the health of the subject or the validity of the&#xD;
             study outcomes (e.g., high risk of neurologic events, conditions that may increase the&#xD;
             chance of stroke) may be compromised by the subject's enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is pregnant or wishes to become pregnant during the first year of study&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is participating in another clinical trial at any time during the duration of&#xD;
             the study that could confound the treatment or outcomes of this investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject with known allergy to platinum or cobalt chromium alloy (including the major&#xD;
             elements platinum, cobalt, chromium, nickel or molybdenum).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of previous acute ischemic stroke&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is unable to undergo DSA or CTA imaging at follow-up&#xD;
