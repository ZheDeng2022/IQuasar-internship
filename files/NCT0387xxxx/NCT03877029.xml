  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is to generate evidence about quality of life related to side&#xD;
      effects of treatment of women with screen-detected versus symptomatic breast cancer. The&#xD;
      project will investigate the impact of detection mode (by screening or by symptoms) versus&#xD;
      tumor characteristics as a predictor of quality of life among breast cancer survivors. The&#xD;
      burden of long-term effects, measured as quality of life at specific points after diagnosis,&#xD;
      will be compared between these groups. The results will also be compared with a control group&#xD;
      of women, who have attended screening, but never been diagnosed with breast cancer.&#xD;

      The project will include a retrospective information which will be collected by using a&#xD;
      self-administered questionnaire about the treatment women received and their quality of life&#xD;
      at certain time points after a breast cancer diagnosis. Women aged 50-69 years at the time of&#xD;
      diagnosis are the target group of BreastScreen Norway and also for this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The women will be identified from the Cancer Registry databases. The questionnaire will be&#xD;
      based on EQ-5D-5L and will be developed in close collaboration with breast cancer survivors&#xD;
      who have personally experienced the long-term effects of breast cancer treatment, whether&#xD;
      resulting from screen-detected or symptomatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire will cover topics related to demographics, treatment, and information&#xD;
      required to estimate health related quality of life (HRQoL) and Quality-Adjusted Life Years&#xD;
      (QALY). Information about detection mode and disease stage at diagnosis will be extracted&#xD;
      from the Cancer Registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study I - a review of the literature in a paper describing and analyzing the current evidence&#xD;
      on quality of life among women diagnosed with breast cancer and treated for this disease,&#xD;
      with a focus on disease stage at diagnosis. Due to substantial changes in treatment during&#xD;
      the last decades, only studies reporting on women who have received treatment in 1995 or&#xD;
      later will be included. Solely studies written in English will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For studies II, III and IV, data collected from the self-administered questionnaire will be&#xD;
      used. In addition, information about screening history and tumor characteristics will be&#xD;
      obtained from the Cancer Registry of Norway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Study II, quality of life will be compared between 1000 women treated for screen-detected&#xD;
      and 1000 women treated for symptomatic breast cancer. The main hypothesis is that women with&#xD;
      screen-detected breast cancer have a higher quality of life than women diagnosed with&#xD;
      symptomatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study III will be a continuation of Study II, where quality of life among women with&#xD;
      screen-detected breast cancer, interval breast cancer, breast cancer diagnosed outside the&#xD;
      screening program and women without any diagnosis of breast cancer will be analyzed. The main&#xD;
      hypothesis is that women with no history of breast cancer and those with a screen-detected&#xD;
      breast cancer have a higher quality of life than those diagnosed with an interval breast&#xD;
      cancer or breast cancer detected outside the screening program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of Study IV is to investigate the impact of detection mode versus tumor&#xD;
      characteristics as the main predictor of long-term quality of life among women diagnosed and&#xD;
      treated for breast cancer among the two groups of women treated for breast cancer (diagnosed&#xD;
      with sceen-detected breast cancer, diagnosed with interval breast cancer, and diagnosed with&#xD;
      symptomatic breast cancer).&#xD;

        The study population will include women residing in Norway, who are currently alive and&#xD;
        were invited and attended, and were invited but did not attend the screening program. Among&#xD;
        the attending and not attending women, women who were and were not diagnosed with breast&#xD;
        cancer, 1996-2016, will be randomly selected. The women diagnosed with breast cancer will&#xD;
        be stratified by detection mode (screen-detected versus symptomatic breast cancer). The&#xD;
        women within each group will be matched by year of diagnosis, age and residing county.&#xD;
        Additionally, women who have never had a diagnosis of breast cancer will be randomly&#xD;
        selected from the target population of BreastScreen Norway. The women will be matched by&#xD;
        age and residing county.&#xD;
