  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at the best ways to prevent anxiety and depression in&#xD;
      older Latino adults who are at risk for developing anxiety and depression. Participants will&#xD;
      be randomized to either a health promotion intervention or a healthy lifestyles education&#xD;
      program.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the prevalence and morbidity of depression in later life, the inadequacies of current&#xD;
      treatment approaches for averting years living with disability, the inequities in access to&#xD;
      the mental health care delivery system, and the workforce shortages to meet the mental health&#xD;
      needs of older Latinos, development and testing of innovative strategies to prevent&#xD;
      depression and anxiety are of great public health significance and have the potential to&#xD;
      change practice.&#xD;
