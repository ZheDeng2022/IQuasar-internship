  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Somali-born women comprise one of the largest groups of immigrant women of childbearing age&#xD;
      in Sweden, with increased risks for perinatal morbidity and mortality and poor experiences of&#xD;
      care. Midwives in antenatal care have expressed a need for development of care tailored for&#xD;
      this group of women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim is to develop and test the acceptability and immediate impacts of group&#xD;
      antenatal care for Somali women residing in Sweden, in an effort to improve their experiences&#xD;
      of antenatal care, their knowledge about childbearing and the Swedish health care system,&#xD;
      their emotional wellbeing and ultimately, their pregnancy outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes four steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step I is the preparation phase including needs assessment. Step II is the intervention&#xD;
      development and evaluation tool development phase. Step III is the intervention phase, which&#xD;
      includes the implementation and evaluation of the intervention using historical controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step IV is the process evaluation and &quot;lessons learned&quot;. Historical controls (n=80) have&#xD;
      received standard individual care according to the national Swedish program for antenatal&#xD;
      care, i.e. 8-9 appointments with a midwife during a normal pregnancy. Women in the&#xD;
      intervention group (n=80) receive Group Antenatal Care provided in group sessions in a&#xD;
      dialogue sensitive to language and cultural issues. The sessions are led by a midwife,&#xD;
      assisted by a trained female Somali interpreter. 15 minutes for individual checkups in&#xD;
      privacy are provided at end of the session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes: Women's overall ratings of antenatal care and views about specific aspects&#xD;
      of care are captured by core questions in the Migrant Friendly Maternity Care Questionnaire&#xD;
      (MFMCQ); and emotional wellbeing by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data are collected at recruitment, in gestational week 36 and at 2 months postpartum by means&#xD;
      of face-to face interviews or interviews by telephone by a trained bilingual research&#xD;
      assistant.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Group antenatal care is developed in collaboration with Somali women, midwives and a&#xD;
      reference group; to suit Somali born women's needs. The intervention is now evaluated for&#xD;
      feasibility, acceptability and sustainability, by means of a historically controlled trial.&#xD;
      The study is a non-randomized feasibility study in which the intervention and material has&#xD;
      been developed parallel to the data collection for the control group; i.e. the historical&#xD;
      controls receiving standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives for the study are;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To establish with Somali-born women and antenatal caregivers the acceptability and&#xD;
           feasibility of group antenatal care and to develop an appropriate model in order to&#xD;
           improve outcomes for Somali-born women;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To establish appropriate recruitment and data collection procedures and outcome measures&#xD;
           in consultation with the Somali community and with care providers in order to evaluate&#xD;
           the new model; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To implement and evaluate an agreed model of group antenatal care in partnership with&#xD;
           the Somali community and antenatal caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step I was the preparation phase, including needs assessment, the development of contextual&#xD;
      understanding and building a logic model for the project. A project steering group comprised&#xD;
      of research team members, antenatal care midwives and representatives of the Somali community&#xD;
      in Borlänge and North Stockholm was formed, to inform the intervention and the study. Somali&#xD;
      born women in local community settings were encountered to develop a fuller understanding of&#xD;
      issues and concerns about pregnancy and birth in a new country. The idea of group antenatal&#xD;
      care was also discussed with women antenatal care midwives for its relevance, attractiveness&#xD;
      and feasibility, and further how to best evaluate such a model. Focus group discussions were&#xD;
      conducted with the following groups: 1) Somali born mothers 2) Somali born fathers; all with&#xD;
      recent birth giving experience in Sweden, and 3) antenatal care midwives in multi-cultural&#xD;
      settings in Sweden. The discussions were tape recorded and analysed by means of thematic&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step II was the intervention development and evaluation tool development phase. The knowledge&#xD;
      gained in the first step, was used to develop an appropriate Group Antenatal Care model in&#xD;
      dialogue with the project steering group and midwives. The participating midwives&#xD;
      participated in a two days education about group antenatal care facilitation of group&#xD;
      discussions, with input from the Steering Group representatives and findings in the focus&#xD;
      groups discussions to enhance their understanding. Participating interpreters were oriented&#xD;
      in the Swedish antenatal care system and the concept of group antenatal care. During this&#xD;
      phase information material regarding the study and the intervention, a manual for midwives&#xD;
      and tools for data collection were developed, and data collection for the historical controls&#xD;
      receiving standard care commenced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step III is the intervention phase, which has commenced. In this phase the implementation and&#xD;
      evaluation of the intervention is taking place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention and intervention group: Group antenatal care&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is a developed group antenatal care to suit Somali women. Group antenatal&#xD;
      care follows the same guidelines as for individual care but with content tailored according&#xD;
      to findings in phase 1; i.e. based on person centred principles and dialogue by the use of&#xD;
      motivational interviewing in group. The main-part of the care is provided in group sessions&#xD;
      in a dialogue sensitive to language and cultural issues. Group numbers are around 8; the&#xD;
      woman and if she wishes, her partner and/or other chosen companion. The sessions is led by a&#xD;
      midwife, assisted by the trained female Somali interpreter/advocate. Two midwives takes turns&#xD;
      leading the sessions for continuity and back-up. Sessions will be held in the antenatal&#xD;
      clinic. Information and discussions include for instance sharing of information about being&#xD;
      pregnant and giving birth in Somalia and Sweden, differences in health care, role of and&#xD;
      trust in midwives and doctors, complications during pregnancy, labour and birth, and healthy&#xD;
      diet during pregnancy. One hour will be allocated for individual meetings with one of the&#xD;
      midwives (the same every time) in the clinic while the group members can chat and socialise.&#xD;
      The midwife will document attendance and compile a summary of the discussions in a checklist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes: Women's overall rating of antenatal care and views about specific aspects&#xD;
      of care are captured by a core question in the Migrant Friendly Maternity Care Questionnaire&#xD;
      (MFMCQ) developed by the Reproductive Outcomes And Migration international research&#xD;
      collaboration (team members Small and Essen involved), now also translated and culturally&#xD;
      validated in Somali (by Essen) and available for use in this study. Women's emotional&#xD;
      wellbeing is measured by the EPDS, available in a Somali translation, but not yet fully&#xD;
      validated requiring further cultural validation as part of the development work for this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: Adequate number of visits are measured by the The Adequacy of Prenatal&#xD;
      Care Utilization Index (APCUI), i.e. expected number of visits in relation to actual number&#xD;
      adjusted for gestational week at booking visit and delivery). Social support during&#xD;
      pregnancy, worries about the upcoming birth and knowledge about different aspects of&#xD;
      maternity care are assessed in interviews with women. Information about birth events and&#xD;
      infant health will be retrieved from patient records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: The baseline measurement is conducted at recruitment, around gestational&#xD;
      week 20. A research assistant contacts women for a face-to-face interview in a place of their&#xD;
      choice. The interview follows the first questionnaire (Q1) including questions on background&#xD;
      (education, occupation), migration (time in country, reason for migration, migration status,&#xD;
      language) and social support, knowledge of the health system, pregnancy and birth and&#xD;
      expectations about the up-coming birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up interviews will take place around gestational week 36 and at two months postpartum&#xD;
      using a second and third questionnaire (Q2, Q3) with questions from the MFMCQ about&#xD;
      experiences of care received during the pregnancy and birth and attendance at parent&#xD;
      education classes. Maternal and infant data will be retrieved from the patient record and&#xD;
      include the following: gestational age at the first visit, Hemoglobin, S-Ferritin, weight&#xD;
      gain, relevant health conditions, total number of antenatal care visits, attendance at parent&#xD;
      education, mode of birth, interventions (induction of labour, pain relief including epidural,&#xD;
      oxytocin), blood loss, diagnoses (mother) and gestational age, birth weight, small for&#xD;
      gestational age, large for gestational age, head circumference, Apgar score, umbilical cord&#xD;
      pH, and the need for neonatal intensive care (infant). Midwives' experiences of different&#xD;
      aspects of the intervention will be collected by means of individual interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: Historical controls: Individual care&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual care follow the present model of care according to the national Swedish program&#xD;
      for antenatal care, i.e.8-9 appointments with a midwife during a normal pregnancy. The visits&#xD;
      are scheduled for 30 minutes and include information and regular pregnancy check-ups. Women&#xD;
      are offered classes that provide preparation for birth and parenthood according to the same&#xD;
      guidelines and the present routine at the clinic. Midwives are the primary caregivers and&#xD;
      they meet the same women throughout pregnancy. Obstetricians and general practitioners will&#xD;
      have a consultant role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment for both intervention and control groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In line with the actual birth rates and recruitment of one third of the Somali women at both&#xD;
      sites, 80 women have been recruited as historical controls (2017-2018) and 80 will&#xD;
      participate in the new model (2018-2019). Inclusion criteria are Somali born women 18 years&#xD;
      of age or beyond, both nulliparous and multiparous, &lt;25 gestational weeks giving consent to&#xD;
      access their patient record data. The only exclusion criterion is severe medical problem(s)&#xD;
      requiring individual care only, as determined by the participating clinical practice.Women&#xD;
      are invited to participate with the help of bilingual research assistants and receive verbal&#xD;
      and written information in Somali about the study. A small gift will be offered for their&#xD;
      baby in appreciation for taking part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences will be described as odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals after estimation by&#xD;
      means of logistic regression analyses. Comparison of means will be undertaken using t-tests&#xD;
      where data are normally distributed, or medians compared using Mann-Whitney U tests if not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step IV consists of a process evaluation using a mixed methods approach with data collection&#xD;
      conducted throughout the study. The process evaluation will address whether the intervention&#xD;
      was carried out according to plan, what was achieved, if and what adaptations were needed,&#xD;
      who was reached by the intervention, any unexpected events and to understand the mechanisms&#xD;
      of impact and what mediated these mechanisms. The process evaluation will also address&#xD;
      contextual factors.&#xD;
