  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 3.5% to 6% of newly diagnosed breast cancer patients are stage IV metastatic.&#xD;
      De novo metastatic breast cancer accounts for 20% to 25% of these cases. Despite a decrease&#xD;
      in mortality in Europe and North America due to early detection and access to treatment,&#xD;
      breast cancer remains the 2ⁿᵈ leading cause of cancer deaths in developed countries after&#xD;
      lung cancer and the world's leading cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the ESME French national retrospective cohort (NCT03275311), the newly diagnosed estrogen&#xD;
      receptor (ER)-positive and HER2-negative (luminal) metastatic patients had a 59.1 months&#xD;
      overall survival (OS) for pre-menopausal women and 44.7 months for postmenopausal women. In&#xD;
      the same cohort, the median OS was 47.4 months for de novo metastatic patients with hormone&#xD;
      receptor (HR)-positive / HER2-negative breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most important current treatment for metastatic breast cancer remains systemic therapy.&#xD;
      Surgery and radiation are mainly used to treat symptoms. However, more than 15 retrospective&#xD;
      studies have assessed the impact of locoregional treatment on relapse and OS. These studies&#xD;
      suggested an improvement of the OS in patients with de novo metastatic breast cancer thanks&#xD;
      to the addition of locoregional treatment to systemic therapy. Recent data from the ESME&#xD;
      cohort suggest that patients with de novo luminal or HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer&#xD;
      may benefit from local treatment of the primary tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several prospective trials have attempted to demonstrate the benefit of locoregional&#xD;
      treatment with mixed results. This can be explained by a limited power of statistical&#xD;
      analysis, on the recruitment of patients with breast cancer of all types, and on a limited&#xD;
      access to effective systemic therapies in some cases and all before the area of anti CD4/6&#xD;
      which is the current standard treatment in patients with HR-positive / HER2-negative luminal&#xD;
      metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, guidelines indicate that a &quot;multimodal approach, including curative locoregional&#xD;
      treatments, should be considered&quot;. As a result, many clinicians offer locoregional treatment&#xD;
      of the primary tumor, especially if there is a good response to the first line of systematic&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taken together, these data underscore the need for an evaluation of the value of combined&#xD;
      therapy - endocrine therapy - CDK4/6 inhibitor and locoregional treatment - in this&#xD;
      population of patients with newly diagnosed HR-positive / HER2-negative breast cancer.&#xD;

               -  Visceral crisis is defined as severe organ dysfunction as assessed by signs and&#xD;
                  symptoms, laboratory studies and rapid progression of disease. Visceral crisis is&#xD;
                  not the mere presence of visceral metastases but implies important visceral&#xD;
                  compromise leading to a clinical indication for a more rapidly efficacious&#xD;
                  therapy, particularly since another treatment option at progression will probably&#xD;
                  not be possible.&#xD;
