  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, active-control, multi-center, phase IIb/III clinical study&#xD;
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of surufatinib vs. Capecitabine as a second-line therapy&#xD;
      in patients with unresectable or metastatic biliary tract cancer (BTC). About 298 subjects&#xD;
      are randomly assigned to two study treatment groups in the ratio of 1:1 by Interactive Web&#xD;
      Response System (IWRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active group: 300 mg of surufatinib，once a day for 3 weeks as a cycle;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group: In each 3-week cycle, Capecitabine is given at 1250 mg/m2 by oral&#xD;
           administration twice a day for 2 weeks, followed by 1 week rest period (equivalent to&#xD;
           2500 mg/m2 total daily dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be treated based on the arm to which they have been randomized. Treatment&#xD;
      on study will continue until disease progression, death, intolerable toxicity or other&#xD;
      criteria for discontinuation from study treatment. The tumor assessments are performed with&#xD;
      imaging every 6 weeks (+3 days) until progressive disease (RECIST v1.1) or death on the study&#xD;
      treatment period, and the treatment and survival of the patients after progressive disease&#xD;
      are recorded. Safety indicators include adverse events, laboratory tests, vital signs, and&#xD;
      changes in electrocardiograms and echocardiograms.&#xD;
