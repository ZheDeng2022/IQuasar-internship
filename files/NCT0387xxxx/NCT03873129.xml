  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is now well-accepted that lowering community-level viral load through expansion of&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) can reduce HIV transmission among people who use drugs. However,&#xD;
      achieving durable viral suppression among patients with substance use disorders is a major&#xD;
      challenge for providers and health systems. This study aims to adapt and implement an&#xD;
      existing mobile health (mHealth) system, A-CHESS (Addiction Comprehensive Health Enhancement&#xD;
      Support System) to improve care for HIV patients with substance use disorders.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with substance use disorders are continuously at risk for relapse and other&#xD;
      disruptive life events, which may lead to lapses in antiretroviral treatment and subsequent&#xD;
      viral rebound, thereby increasing their level of infectivity. Behaviors that place others at&#xD;
      risk for HIV transmission such as sharing drug paraphernalia and unprotected sex may also&#xD;
      increase during these periods of social and behavioral instability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various biomedical, behavioral, and structural interventions have been used to prevent lapses&#xD;
      in HIV care or minimize their impact when they occur. A potentially transformative strategy&#xD;
      would be the one that makes novel use of ubiquitous technology and the existing clinical&#xD;
      workforce to provide highly-effective, tailored support to the patients at greatest risk, at&#xD;
      the time and place it is needed the most.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has 2 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I has been completed and it was an observational study, not a clinical trial. Patients&#xD;
      who volunteered were recruited to use the mobile phone app to enter data, but it was not&#xD;
      intended to improve their health or health care. The data collected during phase 1 will be&#xD;
      used to inform the intervention in phase 2, where the study team hope to use the system to&#xD;
      improve patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 will conduct a single-arm implementation study (with historical controls) of A-CHESS&#xD;
      when implemented in 2 high-volume HIV clinics, providing evidence describing the&#xD;
      effectiveness and durability of an mHealth strategy for maintaining viral suppression among&#xD;
      patients with substance use disorders treated with ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive mHealth system that&#xD;
      identifies the critical time-varying determinants of lapses in HIV care for substance using&#xD;
      patients, and translates these diverse inputs into actionable, patient-specific alerts to&#xD;
      clinical providers. This goal will be achieved by adapting and implementing an existing&#xD;
      mHealth intervention, A-CHESS, which might improve HIV care for patients with substance use&#xD;
      disorders through two mechanisms. First, existing A-CHESS services will improve treatment&#xD;
      adherence by enhancing self-determination (i.e., intrinsic motivation, competence and social&#xD;
      relatedness). Second, through new functionality incorporating predictive analytics with&#xD;
      patient-level data, A-CHESS will identify moments when patients are at the highest risk for&#xD;
      antiretroviral treatment failure, allowing clinic-based staff to provide targeted&#xD;
      interventions that maximize the efficiency of care coordination resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If successful, this project would translate important individual and neighborhood-level data&#xD;
      into timely and clinically-relevant knowledge that is accessible to the HIV care team,&#xD;
      representing a major step forward in our ability to support patients with complex needs.&#xD;
