      The second visit of the Expanded Programme of Immunization when the child is 2 months old&#xD;
      (EPI-2) represents a unique opportunity to link the EPI and PMTCT programmes and to introduce&#xD;
      preventive and therapeutic rescue interventions in order to: 1) Assess the efficacy of the&#xD;
      PMTCT cascade up to 2 months postpartum; 2) Allow at least 80% of HIV-1-infected infants&#xD;
      identified at the second EPI visit who were not involved in HIV care to initiate ARVs at the&#xD;
      earliest, but no later than 2 months after confirmation of HIV diagnosis; 3) Reduce HIV-1&#xD;
      transmission to less than 3% between 2 and 12 months among exposed children who completed the&#xD;
      second EPI visit&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the vast majority of sub-Saharan African countries, all mothers attend an immunization&#xD;
      (EPI) visit when their child is 6 to 8 weeks old (the first EPI visit for BCG and OPV0&#xD;
      vaccination, takes place at childbirth).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study primarily aims at utilizing existing strategies to prevent postnatal HIV-1&#xD;
      transmission through optimizing the use of lamivudine as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for&#xD;
      at risk children. For this purpose, the study will use recently marketed diagnostic point of&#xD;
      care (POC) tests at the first level of care for maternal HIV-1 viral load and early infant&#xD;
      diagnosis (EID). This POC early infant diagnosis will also allow optimizing treatment of&#xD;
      HIV-infected infants by offering to all the benefits of an early ART initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the second visit for routine vaccination (Expanded Program of&#xD;
      Immunization visit 2: EPI-2) represents a unique opportunity to link EPI and PMTCT programs&#xD;
      and introduce rescue preventive and therapeutic interventions. The EPI visit will allow an&#xD;
      opportunity to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the efficacy of the PMTCT cascade.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identify HIV-1-infected children early and refer them for early initiation of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Provide their children with an antiretroviral drug that can protect them from HIV-1,&#xD;
           irrespective of their mother's adherence to ART as part of the Phase III Randomized&#xD;
           Controlled Trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase III RCT will be testing a rescue preventive intervention among HIV-1-uninfected&#xD;
      children exposed to HIV-1 by their HIV-1-infected breastfeeding mothers against a control&#xD;
      routine Option B+ implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following a brief questionnaire and counselling on ART adherence and breastfeeding,&#xD;
      participant mothers aged 15 years or older who meet eligibility criteria will be randomized&#xD;
      to the control or intervention arms at a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase III Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) testing a rescue preventive intervention&#xD;
      among HIV-1-uninfected children exposed to HIV-1 by their HIV-1-infected breastfeeding&#xD;
      mothers against a control routine Option B+ implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control arm, routine Option B+ national guidelines including HIV-1 plasmatic viral&#xD;
      load testing will be adhered to as part of the clinics' usual practice. Visits will take&#xD;
      place at 6-8 weeks, 6 and 12 months post-partum to collect samples from the mother for the&#xD;
      analysis of viral load results at 12 months. In addition, at 6-8 weeks, 6 and 12 months&#xD;
      post-partum, POC tests will be done for the diagnosis of HIV-1 in their infants (by HIV-1 DNA&#xD;
      PCR) and results will be shared within 2 hours. Children infected with HIV-1 will be referred&#xD;
      to the National Programme for confirmed diagnosis and immediate ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention arm aims at reducing the risk of HIV transmission for infants exposed to&#xD;
      large amounts of HIV-1 through breastfeeding, which correlates with the maternal plasma viral&#xD;
      load. At 6-8 weeks post-partum, a venous blood sample will be taken from the mothers to&#xD;
      assess their viral load using a GenXpert® HIV RNA POC test. Concomitantly, a capillary blood&#xD;
      sample will be taken from the child for the detection of HIV-1 (by HIV-1 DNA PCR). Children&#xD;
      infected with HIV-1 will be referred to the National Programme for confirmed HIV diagnosis&#xD;
      and immediate ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For children that are not HIV-1 infected in the intervention arm, the results on the mother's&#xD;
      viral load will guide the next steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Mothers with a detectable plasma viral load (≥ 1000 copies/mL) will receive reinforced&#xD;
      counselling on ART adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, their child will be initiated on PrEP, lamivudine syrup (7.5 mg twice daily if 2&#xD;
      to 4 kg; 25 mg twice a day if weight &lt;8 kg; and 50 mg twice a day if weight &gt;8 kg). Mothers&#xD;
      will come with their child to the study site every month (at M3, M4, M5, M7, M8, M9, M10 and&#xD;
      M11) to collect drug supplies, safety follow-up, child's PrEP adherence adherence and&#xD;
      counselling, mother's ART adherence and reporting. In Zambia, high risk HIV negative infants&#xD;
      on a 12-week prophylactic regimen and are still taking ART at this visit, their first day of&#xD;
      the study prophylaxis administration will take place at Month 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Mothers with an undetectable viral loads (&lt;1000 copies/mL) will continue receiving ART&#xD;
      adherence counselling. However, the children of these mothers will not be initiated on PrEP&#xD;
      on the study at 6-8 weeks of age. However, because ART compliance declines rapidly over time&#xD;
      within the first year of initiation, additional monitoring on the viral load of the mother&#xD;
      and the diagnosis of the child will take place at 6 months: If the maternal plasmatic viral&#xD;
      load is ≥ 1000 copies/mL, the child will be initiated on PrEP, lamivudine syrup (7.5 mg twice&#xD;
      daily if 2 to 4 kg; 25 mg twice a day if weight &lt;8 kg; and 50 mg twice a day if weight &gt;8&#xD;
      kg), until the baby is 12 months old or until the confirmed end of breastfeeding.&#xD;
      Breastfeeding will be considered to be ceased if the mother confirms she is no longer&#xD;
      breastfeeding for 2 consecutive monthly visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children infected with HIV-1 will be referred to the National Programme for confirmed&#xD;
      diagnosis and immediate ART.&#xD;
