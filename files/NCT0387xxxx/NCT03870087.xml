  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To collect data on the routine patterns of use, safety and effectiveness, including the&#xD;
      clinical and technical performance of the CorPath GRX System, in the delivery and&#xD;
      manipulation of coronary guidewires and stent/balloon catheters, and manipulation of guide&#xD;
      catheters during PCI procedures in the first 231 patients treated with the CorPath device in&#xD;
      Japan.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, multi-center patient registry in Japan of the CorPath GRX&#xD;
      System to examine its performance during PCI procedures and patient outcomes through 72 hours&#xD;
      post-procedure or hospital discharge, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
