  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DigTech investigates the effect of a text message-based intervention to encourage lifestyle&#xD;
      change on objective measures of cardiovascular risk in individuals with coronary heart&#xD;
      disease (CHD) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DigTech will recruit 700 participants from 18-75 years old with CHD after PCI. Half of the&#xD;
      participants will be randomised into a 24 week intervention trial, which includes sending 4&#xD;
      personalized short messages about risk factors modification 4 times per week and the other&#xD;
      half will be controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete 3 main study visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1: Baseline visit conducted at the beginning of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 2: Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 3: End of study (24 weeks). Each visit will repeat the same set of cardiovascular&#xD;
           measures including information about previous treatment, blood pressure, ECG,&#xD;
           echocardiography, stress tests, blood sampling, International Physical Activity&#xD;
           Questionnaires (IPAQ) and other measures.&#xD;

      DESIGN: DigTech is a parallel-group, single-blind, randomized clinical trial investigating&#xD;
      the changes in cardiovascular risk factors (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C]&#xD;
      level, blood pressure, body mass index [BMI]) according to personalized intervention, based&#xD;
      on individual short messages in CHD patients after PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND AND AIMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular disease prevention, including lifestyle modification, is important but&#xD;
      underutilized. Mobile health strategies could address this gap but lack evidence of&#xD;
      therapeutic benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial aims at the examination of the effect of a lifestyle-focused personalized support&#xD;
      program delivered by mobile phone text message on cardiovascular risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANTS: 700 participants aged 18-75 with CHD after PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT: Tyumen Cardiology Research Center, branch of the Tomsk NRMC&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONFIDENTIALITY: All information and documents collected will be stored securely and kept in&#xD;
      strict confidence in compliance with regulatory acts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study samples, investigation results and incidental findings. The use of the participants'&#xD;
      study samples and investigations are clearly defined in the participant information leaflet&#xD;
      and will be explained during the informed consent process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSIDERATION OF NULL HYPOTHESES: A null hypotheses that personalized lifestyle intervention&#xD;
      based on received 4 text messages per week for 6 months in addition to usual care in CHD&#xD;
      patients after PCI does not reduce LDL-C levels, blood pressure and BMI&quot; was not selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE SELECTION: Prior study shows that a sample size of 634, increasing to 704 to&#xD;
      allow for a10% loss to follow-up, would have 90% power (2-tailed and at a 5% significance&#xD;
      level) to detect a difference of 10 mg/dL in LDL-C level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION: The text message will be based on the prevention program involved delivery of&#xD;
      regular personalized text messages (some messages personally addressed through a&#xD;
      &quot;mail-merge&quot;-type function with the participant's preferred name) providing advice,&#xD;
      motivation, and information that is aimed to improve diet, increase physical activity, and&#xD;
      encourage smoking cessation (if relevant). Content for each participant will be selected&#xD;
      using a re-specified algorithm dependent on key baseline characteristics. Participants will&#xD;
      receive 4 messages per week for 24 weeks. Each message will be sent on 4 of 5 randomly&#xD;
      selected days and arrived at random times of the day during working hours. The content of&#xD;
      messages will be based on national guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES AND DATA COLLECTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCREENING VISITS: Screening Visit Procedures (Visit 0). Evaluation of inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Patients will provide written informed consent on this visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAIN STUDY VISITS COMPLETION OF STUDY VISITS 1-3&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three main visits planned for each participant:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: conducted at the beginning of trial (baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire. It will collect detailed information about physical activities&#xD;
           (International Physical Activity Questionnaires short form) and also lifestyle&#xD;
           information such as daily routines and use of alcohol and tobacco, information about&#xD;
           previous treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical Measures. Investigators will measure blood pressure, height, weight, BMI, heart&#xD;
           rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiovascular Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Electrocardiogram (ECG).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Echocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Six Minute Walk Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Coronary angiography&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood Sampling including blood lipid spectrum (total cholesterol, triglycerides,&#xD;
           cholesterol high-density lipoproteins and cholesterol low-density lipoproteins). Fasting&#xD;
           blood samples will be analyzed by local laboratories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: Randomization. Randomization will be performed after PCI, prior to discharge from&#xD;
      the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will occur via a computerized randomization program that will access through a&#xD;
      secure web interface. The random allocation sequence will be in a uniform 1:1 and will be&#xD;
      concealed from study personnel. Study staff will enroll patients by entering data into the&#xD;
      secure web interface. The computerized randomization program interfaced with the&#xD;
      message-sending program to trigger the sending of messages to patients randomized to the&#xD;
      intervention. To maintain blinding of personnel study, patients will be informed of their&#xD;
      allocation in a text message sent after hospital discharge. Prior to their follow-up&#xD;
      appointment patients also will receive a text message to ask them not to reveal their&#xD;
      allocation status to study personnel or clinicians in follow-up visits. Intervention&#xD;
      participants will receive, in addition to usual care, the 6-months prevention program of&#xD;
      approximately 96 messages. Control participants will receive usual care, which generally&#xD;
      included community follow-up with the majority referred to inpatient cardiac rehabilitation,&#xD;
      as determined by their usual physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3: conducted after 24 weeks (at the end of the trial, Follow-up visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSIS: Patient demographic characteristics and other baseline information will be&#xD;
      summarised by treatment group. Numbers (with percentages) for binary and categorical&#xD;
      variables and mean (standard deviation), or median (interquartile or full range) for&#xD;
      continuous variables will be presented. Normality of variables will be assessed by visual&#xD;
      assessment of the normality curves and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The analysis of the&#xD;
      primary outcome will be assessed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusting for baseline&#xD;
      values and minimisation factors used in the randomisation process. Results will be presented&#xD;
      as adjusted mean difference in change in ambulatory blood pressure between randomised groups&#xD;
      at 4 months with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and associated two-sided p value. The above&#xD;
      method was also used for continuous secondary outcomes. With respect to management of&#xD;
      combined risk factors, the proportion of patients achieving control of risk factors was&#xD;
      analyzed in terms of relative risk at month 6 and compared between groups using a&#xD;
      log-binomial regression. If the model assumptions are not met and evidence of departure from&#xD;
      Normality is observed, transformations of the data will be employed or non-parametric tests&#xD;
      will be carried out. Statistical analysis will be carried out using SPSS statistical&#xD;
      software.&#xD;
