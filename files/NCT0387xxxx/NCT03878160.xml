  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to identify Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS) patients' specific&#xD;
      needs and preferences for depression treatment via in-person or virtual individual interviews&#xD;
      to (a) guide MBCT adaptation; and identify barriers and facilitators to (b) group&#xD;
      videoconferencing delivery, and (c) blood spot data collection to enhance feasibility.&#xD;
      Through qualitative measures participants will report specific physical, cognitive, and&#xD;
      behavioral symptoms to be targeted in the intervention, discuss barriers and facilitators to&#xD;
      participating in a video-conference treatment program and completing blood spot data&#xD;
      collection procedures.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a qualitative research study that will involve individual interviews of ACS patients&#xD;
      with elevated depression symptoms (stratified by time since ACS [≤2 years and &gt;2 years post&#xD;
      ACS]; N=10 participants per strata) to explore patients' treatment needs and preferences for&#xD;
      an adapted MBCT intervention, and barriers and facilitators for future intervention research&#xD;
      procedures (i.e., videoconferencing delivery of the intervention and collection of dried&#xD;
      blood spots). It will also involve individual interviews of ACS patients without elevated&#xD;
      depression symptoms (N=10) to better understand the needs of ACS patients who are interested&#xD;
      in treatment but not currently depressed, in order to inform future outreach and treatment&#xD;
      development efforts (total N=30). Interviews will be conducted either in person, by phone, or&#xD;
      by video conference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited in several ways. First, participants will be identified using&#xD;
      the MGH Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR). Participants will be pre-screened for&#xD;
      eligibility and sent an opt-out letter. Patients will have the option to opt out via phone or&#xD;
      email. Patients who do not opt out and meet eligibility requirements will be contacted via&#xD;
      phone. Over the phone, patients who express interest in the study will complete an&#xD;
      eligibility screen; patients who meet study eligibility criteria will then complete a verbal&#xD;
      consent to enroll in the study. Second, patients will be recruited through advertisements&#xD;
      (e.g., flyers, brochures) placed throughout inpatient and/or outpatient hospital clinics,&#xD;
      community mental health clinics, community businesses (e.g. coffee shops) and social media&#xD;
      platforms. The advertisements will ask patients to contact study staff if they are interested&#xD;
      in learning more about the study, and the screening procedures will be the same as those&#xD;
      described above for RPDR patients. Lastly, patients will be recruited via direct referrals&#xD;
      from their providers (e.g., cardiologists, psychiatrists). We will inform providers about the&#xD;
      study (e.g., via short presentations at their team meetings) and provide them with&#xD;
      advertisement materials to give to their patients. The patients may either contact study&#xD;
      staff directly using the information their provider gave them, and/or the provider will&#xD;
      contact the study team with the patient's information so that the study team may reach out to&#xD;
      the patient. Providers will obtain verbal permission from the patient for the research team&#xD;
      to contact them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once enrolled, participants will partake in a semi-structured in-person individual interview.&#xD;
      Individual interviews will be stratified by time since ACS and depressive symptoms and will&#xD;
      explore (a) emotional symptoms; (b) health behavior challenges; (c) specific preferences for&#xD;
      the MBCT intervention; and (d) potential barriers and facilitators of group videoconferencing&#xD;
      and (e) blood spot data collection. Participants will also complete a survey detailing&#xD;
      depression symptoms, trait mindfulness, health behaviors, and other psychological,&#xD;
      behavioral, and physical constructs that may potentially be impacted by the MBCT intervention&#xD;
      in subsequent trials will be measured. Data collected from the individual interviews will be&#xD;
      used to guide MBCT adaptations and research procedures for future clinical trials.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants With Perspectives on Blood Spot Data Collection</measure>
    <time_frame>one 30-90-minute session</time_frame>
    <description>This portion of the individual interview will focus on exploring ACS patients who had perspectives on participating in a remote dried blood spot procedure. Participants were individually interviewed via telephone using a semi-structured interview guide. Three independent coders conducted qualitative thematic analysis and results were analyzed within each group. The criteria used to determine the outcome measure is the number of participants upon interview who reported any type of perspective on participating in a remote dried blood spot procedure (self-collection of dried blood spot via finger-prick). Please note that the number of perspectives reported for each theme can exceed the number of people per group because each participant reported multiple perspectives (e.g., both pros and cons of videoconferencing).</description>

Individual Interview: Individual Interviews will focus on exploring (a) changes after ACS, such as psychosocial changes and health behavior changes; (b) specific preferences for the MBCT intervention; and (c) potential barriers and facilitators of group videoconferencing and (d) blood spot data collection. Individual interviews will use a semi-structured interview guide. Individual interviews will be conducted until thematic saturation is reached. Individual interviews will be audio-recorded for transcription and data analysis.</description>

Participants were individually interviewed via telephone using a semi-structured interview guide. Three independent coders conducted qualitative thematic analysis and results were analyzed within each group. The criteria used to determine the outcome measure is the number of participants upon interview who reported any type of perspective on participating in a remote dried blood spot procedure (self-collection of dried blood spot via finger-prick). Please note that the number of perspectives reported for each theme can exceed the number of people per group because each participant reported multiple perspectives (e.g., both pros and cons of videoconferencing).</description>

The scoring scale ranges from 1, very slightly or not at all, to 5, extremely. For this study, we will only use the positive affect sub-scale. The scale values for the positive affect sub-scale range from 10-50. Higher values on the positive affect scale represent higher levels of positive affect, whereas, lower values on the negative affect scale represent lower levels of positive affect. Data collection for this measurement is cross-sectional, and is performed during one, 30-90 minute time interval.</description>

          <title>Positive Affect Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)</title>
          <description>This is a 20-question scale, composed of 2, 10-item scales that measure positive and negative affect. The scoring scale ranges from 1, very slightly or not at all, to 5, extremely. For this study, we will only use the positive affect sub-scale. The scale values for the positive affect sub-scale range from 10-50. Higher values on the positive affect scale represent higher levels of positive affect, whereas, lower values on the negative affect scale represent lower levels of positive affect. Data collection for this measurement is cross-sectional, and is performed during one, 30-90 minute time interval.</description>
