    <description>The first 3 subjects will receive oral TMZ at 150mg/m2 day 1 to 5 during cycle&#xD;
1, followed by nivolumab via IV infusion at 480 mg every four weeks (Q4W) starting 4 weeks after TMZ day 1 (i.e. Cycle 2 day 1). Nivolumab will continue for up for 2 years maximum. If confirmed that TMB increased in at least 2 of 3 subjects following 1 cycle of TMZ, then subsequent patients will continue to receive TMZ during cycle 1 only, and the original three participants will not be replaced. If it is determined that TMB did not increase following 1 cycle of TMZ, then subsequent patients will receive TMZ up to cycle 3, those first 3 patients will discontinue further Nivolumab and be replaced and an additional 6 patients will initially be enrolled. If confirmed that TMB increased in at least 1 of 6 subjects following 3 cycles of TMZ, then 12 more patients will be allowed to enroll for a total of 18 in stage I.</description>
