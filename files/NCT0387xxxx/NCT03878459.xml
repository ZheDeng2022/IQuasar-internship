      Purpose: To examine the effect of addition of combination therapy with dapagliflozin plus&#xD;
      pioglitazone to insulin on glucose control and plasma ketone concentration in patients with&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes (T1DM) Research Design: 120 patients with type 1 diabetes who otherwise are&#xD;
      healthy constitute the study population. After screening, eligible subjects will start 4 week&#xD;
      run in. At week 4, subjects will receive dapagliflozin for 12 weeks. At week 16, subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive in a double blind fashion pioglitazone or placebo for 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: the following techniques will be employed in the present study: (1) mixed meal&#xD;
      tolerance test; (2) indirect calorimetry; (3) continuous glucose monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Relevance: the results of the present study will demonstrate that the addition of&#xD;
      pioglitazone to SGLT2 inhibitor in T1DM patients produces greater reduction in the HbA1c&#xD;
      without increasing risk of ketoacidosis and hypoglycemia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insulin deficiency, due to autoimmune destruction of beta cells, is the primary factor&#xD;
      responsible for the development of T1DM, and insulin replacement therapy is the mainstay for&#xD;
      the management of hyperglycemia. However, insulin therapy often is associated with adverse&#xD;
      events, including weight gain which promotes insulin resistance leading to an increase in&#xD;
      insulin demand. This results in a self-perpetuating vicious cycle whereby the increase in&#xD;
      insulin dose causes weight gain that worsens insulin sensitivity, and further enhances&#xD;
      insulin requirement. Hyperinsulinemia per se also induces insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To break this cycle, adjunctive therapies have been added to insulin in T1DM patients to&#xD;
      lower the plasma glucose concentration. However, the addition of metformin, pioglitazone, and&#xD;
      GLP-1 agonists to insulin in T1DM patients have not provided convincing evidence for a&#xD;
      clinically meaningful reduction in the HbA1c or significant reduction in daily insulin dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are a novel class of antidiabetic agents which reduce the plasma&#xD;
      glucose concentration by inhibiting renal glucose reuptake and producing glucosuria. Because&#xD;
      of this unique mechanism of action, which is independent of insulin secretion and insulin&#xD;
      action, SGLT2i have proven to be very effective in lowering the plasma glucose concentration&#xD;
      in T1DM. Initial proof of concept studies have demonstrated that, compared to placebo, all&#xD;
      members of this class (dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, canagliflozin and sotagliflozin)&#xD;
      effectively lower the plasma glucose concentration, HbA1c and daily insulin dose in T1DM&#xD;
      without increased risk of hypoglycemia. Further, SGLT2i improved cardiovascular risk factors&#xD;
      in T1DM by promoting weight loss and decreasing blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the promising potential for SGLT2i as adjunctive therapy to insulin in T1DM, recent&#xD;
      large clinical trials have demonstrated two important limitations to this therapeutic&#xD;
      strategy: First, although the decrease in HbA1c caused by SGLT2i in T1DM patients was&#xD;
      statistically significant, the absolute decrease was relatively modest (0.30-0.45%). The&#xD;
      investigators, previously have shown that SGLT2i stimulate an increase in the basal rate of&#xD;
      hepatic glucose production (HGP) in T2DM patients. This SGLT2i-induced increase in HGP&#xD;
      offsets by approximately one half the amount of glucose lost in the urine. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators have hypothesize that, similar to what they have observed in T2DM patients, the&#xD;
      addition of SGLT2i to insulin in T1DM patients stimulates HGP thereby attenuating the&#xD;
      decrease in HbA1c. Further, the decrease in daily insulin dose after initiating therapy with&#xD;
      SGLT2i in T1DM patients would be expected to enhance the increase in HGP and diminish the&#xD;
      decrease in HbA1c. Thus, preventing the increase in HGP caused by SGLT2i in T1DM can be&#xD;
      expected to markedly amplify the clinical efficacy of SGLT2i and enhance the reduction in&#xD;
      HbA1c.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second limitation of the use of SGLT2i an adjunct therapy to insulin in T1DM patients is&#xD;
      the increase in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) risk. In three large clinical trials , the&#xD;
      addition of SGLT2i to insulin in T1DM patients was associated with a 3-6% increase in DKA&#xD;
      risk (see Table 1 below). Because of the significant morbidity and mortality associated with&#xD;
      DKA, the increased DKA risk in T1DM has raised concerns about the use of SGLT2i as an adjunct&#xD;
      therapy to insulin in T1DM patients despite their multiple metabolic benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators previously have demonstrated that SGLT2i cause a significant increase in&#xD;
      plasma FFA concentration, fat oxidation and subsequent increase in plasma ketone&#xD;
      concentration in T2DM patients (27). Therefore, they hypothesize that in T1DM, SGLT2i cause a&#xD;
      similar increase in plasma FFA concentration, fat oxidation and plasma ketone concentration&#xD;
      which in certain clinical conditions (e.g. acute illness) can increase the production of&#xD;
      ketones and result in the development of DKA. Further, prevention of the increase in plasma&#xD;
      FFA concentration will inhibit the increase in plasma ketone concentration and reduce DKA&#xD;
      risk associated with SGLT2i use in T1DM patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pioglitazone inhibits lipolysis and markedly decreases the plasma FFA concentration. Further,&#xD;
      pioglitazone is a potent inhibitor of HGP. These actions of pioglitazone are due to direct&#xD;
      actions of the drug on adipocytes and liver, respectively, are mediated by PPAR gama, and are&#xD;
      independent of the plasma insulin and glucagon concentrations. In fact, pioglitazone inhibits&#xD;
      lipolysis and HGP in type 2 diabetic patients despite a decrease in plasma insulin&#xD;
      concentration. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that the addition of pioglitazone to&#xD;
      SGLT2i in T1DM patients will prevent the rise in HGP caused by SGLT2i and, thereby, augment&#xD;
      the decrease in HbA1c. Further, combination therapy with pioglitazone plus SGLT2i will&#xD;
      prevent the increase in plasma FFA concentration and subsequent increase in plasma ketone&#xD;
      concentration, thus reducing the risk of DKA.&#xD;
