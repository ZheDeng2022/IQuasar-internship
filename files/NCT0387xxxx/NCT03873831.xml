    <textblock>
      Animal-Assisted Interventions (AAI) can increase social behavior in children with autism&#xD;
      spectrum disorder (ASD), although the mechanism by which this occurs remains elusive. The&#xD;
      central goal of this project is to identify the mechanisms involved in the social-enhancing&#xD;
      effect of dogs on children with ASD. The investigators will incorporate therapy dogs into an&#xD;
      established evidence-based, group social skills instruction program for children with ASD,&#xD;
      using a controlled experimental design with between- and within- subject comparisons and&#xD;
      physiological and behavioral outcome measures. The investigators predict therapy dogs to have&#xD;
      a specific and measurable effect on children's social behavior and that this effect is gained&#xD;
      through identifiable mechanisms. Specifically, the investigators hypothesize that (1) an&#xD;
      integration of therapy dogs into group social skills instruction will result in reduced&#xD;
      stress and improved social behavior compare to traditional group instruction; (2) repeated&#xD;
      exposure to the therapy dog across sessions will increase a child's preference for spending&#xD;
      time with the dog and will increase the social-enhancing effects of the dog; and (3) that the&#xD;
      therapists will experience less stress, engage in more social and affiliative behavior&#xD;
      towards the children, and deliver higher quality instruction during sessions that include&#xD;
      dogs. The investigators will enroll 72 children with ASD into group social skills instruction&#xD;
      classes taught by 6 therapists. Each child will experience a 10-week, 8-student class in&#xD;
      which either (a) the first 5 weeks will involve a therapy dog, (b) the last 5 weeks will&#xD;
      involve the therapy dog, or (c) the class will not involve a therapy dog. The therapists will&#xD;
      teach the courses repeatedly across the three cycles of the program with different children,&#xD;
      rotating through each condition. Social behavior, stress behavior, heart rate, electrodermal&#xD;
      activity, and salivary cortisol concentrations of children and therapists will be assessed&#xD;
      and compared across conditions. The direction of the children's social behavior towards the&#xD;
      dog and peers and the changes in quality of instruction of therapists during dog sessions&#xD;
      compared to no-dog sessions will also be assessed. The outcomes of this research will lead to&#xD;
      significant enhancements in current interventions for individuals with ASD.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 1 in 68 children are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The most&#xD;
      detrimental hallmarks of autism are significant deficits in social and conversational skills,&#xD;
      resulting in difficulties forming and maintaining social relationships. Children who have few&#xD;
      friends are at a high risk for having depression, doing poorly in school, and not being&#xD;
      employed as adults. Animal-Assisted Interventions (AAI) have been shown to increase social&#xD;
      behavior in both children with ASD as well as in various human populations. Children with ASD&#xD;
      display more social behavior in a classroom setting when a therapy dog is present, but while&#xD;
      the effect dogs have on increasing social behavior has been well-established, the mechanism&#xD;
      by which this increase occurs remains elusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our long-term goal is to identify causal mechanisms that may ameliorate the social behavior&#xD;
      deficit in autism. The specific goal of this research is to identify the mechanisms involved&#xD;
      in the social-enhancing effect of dogs on children with ASD. Our central hypothesis is that&#xD;
      therapy dogs have a specific and measurable effect on children's social behaviors.&#xD;
      Furthermore, by directly testing a number of significant confounds frequently found in AAI&#xD;
      research (novelty effects and the effects of the dog on the therapist), the investigators&#xD;
      will rule out alternative hypotheses. It has been suggested that the effects of AAI are&#xD;
      partly caused by the novelty of having an animal in a location where animals are not&#xD;
      typically seen (such as a classroom) rather than caused by an underlying feature specific to&#xD;
      the animal. Additionally, the therapist's potentially altered quality of instruction in&#xD;
      response to the presence of a dog in the room has not been previously explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will attain our goal by incorporating therapy dogs into an established&#xD;
      group social skills instruction program for children with ASD, using a quasi-experimental,&#xD;
      repeated-measures counter-balanced mixed design with physiological and behavioral outcome&#xD;
      measures. Furthermore, using a rigorous experimental single-subject design, the investigators&#xD;
      will assess the effect of the dogs on therapists. Group social skills instruction&#xD;
      interventions based on the principles of applied behavior analysis (ABA) and that target&#xD;
      conversational and communication skills have been shown as particularly successful at&#xD;
      improving social behavior in individuals with ASD. Despite the beneficial outcomes, any&#xD;
      educational interventions, especially those that require social interaction, can be a source&#xD;
      of stress for children with ASD, and stress can impact learning and memory. Creating an&#xD;
      educational setting that balances the levels of stress is beneficial. Dogs may have a&#xD;
      stress-ameliorating effect on the child, thereby allowing social behavior to emerge during&#xD;
      the instructional period and enhance the child's ability to learn social skills. Another&#xD;
      barrier to effective instruction may be that peer-to-peer contact is perceived as highly&#xD;
      aversive to children with ASD. Thus, by providing a non-judgmental therapy dog learning&#xD;
      partner, the children may first practice social skills in a safer environment, free from&#xD;
      negative feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Identify the mechanism by which dogs increase group social behavior in children with&#xD;
      ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will directly test two complementary hypotheses: (1) stress-ameliorating&#xD;
      effect of the dog on the child, and (2) the dog as a non-judgmental learning partner. The&#xD;
      investigators predict that the presence of the dog in group social skills instruction program&#xD;
      (n = 72 children, with 8 children per group) will not only improve the quantity and quality&#xD;
      of social behavior, but also reduce physiological (salivary cortisol, heart rate, and&#xD;
      electrodermal activity) and behavioral signs of stress compared to the absence of the dog.&#xD;
      The investigators further predict that during therapy sessions with dogs, most of the&#xD;
      children's social behavior will be directed towards the dog rather than peers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Identify if and how repeated exposure to the dog influences social behavior of&#xD;
      children with ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that repeated exposure to the therapy dog across sessions will&#xD;
      alter 1) the preference to spend time with the dog, as measured by changes in time spent in&#xD;
      proximity, and 2) the social-enhancing effects of the dog.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Identify the effects of the dog on the therapist. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      during repeated sessions with the dog, therapists (n = 6) will experience less stress (as&#xD;
      measured by salivary cortisol, heart rate, and electrodermal activity), engage in more social&#xD;
      and affiliative behavior towards the children, and deliver higher quality instruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes of this research will lead to significant enhancements in the current&#xD;
      understanding of the mechanism by which dogs increase social behavior in children with ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The innovative combination of methodologies from animal science and ABA therapy is uniquely&#xD;
      suited for the determination of the mechanism of the social-enhancement effect of dogs. By&#xD;
      measuring both behavioral responses and physiological biomarkers of stress during the&#xD;
      intervention, the investigators will determine the mechanism through a rigorous and&#xD;
      all-inclusive approach. Furthermore, by directly assessing two key confounding variables, the&#xD;
      novelty effect and the effect of the dog on the therapist, the investigators will pave the&#xD;
      way for more rigorous research into AAI. Completion of this research will expand our&#xD;
      knowledge about the mechanism by which dogs may benefit children with ASD, introduce new&#xD;
      intervention methods to provide longer-term benefits for children, and provide a starting&#xD;
      point for research into new interdisciplinary technology using animals in ABA-based therapy.&#xD;

Children will be taught new social skills each week using an established teaching interaction procedure, in which the therapist first describes the target skill, provides a rational and context for the behavior, divides the skill into smaller steps, demonstrates the behavior, and has each learner role-play the skill while providing feedback in the form of praise and tokens and corrective instruction. The last week involves a probe &quot;free-play&quot; session, in which children are assessed in a more naturalistic environment without any corrective feedback from therapists.</description>
