  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a randomized clinical trial to test the feasibility, initial&#xD;
      efficacy, and mechanisms of action of our PTSC-S intervention as compared to a time-matched&#xD;
      intervention that does not address task persistence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that participants will attend at least 60% of PTSC-S treatment&#xD;
      sessions and that those attending the PTSC-S treatment sessions will have a larger percentage&#xD;
      of abstinent days and larger rates of prolonged- and 7-day point prevalence abstinence (all&#xD;
      biochemically verified with CO&lt;8ppm) at end-of-treatment and 3-months post quit-date as&#xD;
      compared to those attending an active, time-matched control intervention based on the NCI's&#xD;
      Clearing the Air intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that PTSC-S will result in greater task persistence than will a&#xD;
      control treatment and that greater changes in task persistence will be related to greater&#xD;
      abstinence rates. While a Stage 1b therapy development study such as this is likely to be&#xD;
      underpowered to detect mediation, the investigators will nevertheless test an exploratory&#xD;
      mediational hypothesis that PTSC-S has its effect on smoking abstinence primarily through its&#xD;
      effect on task persistence.&#xD;
