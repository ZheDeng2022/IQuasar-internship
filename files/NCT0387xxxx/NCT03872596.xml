    <textblock>
      This is a two-part trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of Part A is to estimate the ratio of geometric means of&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and their within-subject variability for the 300mg quetiapine&#xD;
      tablet formulation A and the 300mg quetiapine tablet formulation B compared to 300mg&#xD;
      Seroquel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of Part B is to estimate the ratio of geometric means of PK parameters&#xD;
      and their within-subject variability for the selected tablet formulation from Part A of 25mg&#xD;
      quetiapine compared to 25mg Seroquel.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a two-part, crossover study. In Part A, participants will be randomized into one of three treatment sequences, each receiving Seroquel immediate release (IR) 300mg, Quetiapine Formulation A 300mg and Quetiapine Formulation B 300mg. In Part B, participants will be randomized into one of two treatment sequences, each receiving Seroquel IR 25mg and Quetiapine 25mg, the formulation of which will be established in Part A.</intervention_model_description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Part A:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have a current diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, as determined by&#xD;
             the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Version 5 (DSM-5) criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have a Body Mass Index between 18 and 35 kg/m^2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Good physical health as determined by no clinically significant deviation from normal,&#xD;
             in the opinion of the investigator, in medical history, clinical laboratory&#xD;
             determination, ECGs, or physical examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be considered stable, per the investigator's judgment, on one of the&#xD;
             following atypical oral antipsychotic medications at an adequate dose (eg, low- to&#xD;
             mid-range of the recommended dose range for the treatment of schizophrenia or bipolar&#xD;
             disorder, according to the manufacturer labeling) and for an adequate duration (30&#xD;
             days) prior to the administration of IMP: aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, risperidone,&#xD;
             olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone, paliperidone, cariprazine, lurasidone, and&#xD;
             asenapine. Other oral antipsychotic medications may be allowed if approved by the&#xD;
             medical monitor and sponsor; however, clozapine will not be allowed. Per the&#xD;
             investigator's judgment, they should be comfortable with the participant discontinuing&#xD;
             background antipsychotic therapy during the trial period and then restarting the&#xD;
             antipsychotic therapy once trial participation has been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Part B:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female participants between 18 and 45 years of age, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have a Body Mass Index between 18 and 32 kg/m^2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Good physical health as determined by no clinically significant deviation from normal,&#xD;
             in the opinion of the investigator, in medical history, clinical laboratory&#xD;
             determination, ECGs, or physical examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to provide informed consent prior to the initiation of any protocol-related&#xD;
             procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and female participants who are surgically sterile, female participants who have&#xD;
             been postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months prior to the screening visit,&#xD;
             or male participants/female participants (of childbearing potential) who agree to&#xD;
             practice 2 of the approved birth control methods from the screening visit and for at&#xD;
             least 30 days after the last dose of IMP for a female participant or 80 days after the&#xD;
             last dose of IMP for a male participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Part A:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are unable to stop receiving varenicline beyond the screening visit.&#xD;
             If a participant is receiving varenicline at the screening visit, attempts should be&#xD;
             made to discontinue the medication, if clinically feasible, to allow potential&#xD;
             participants to enter the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have a significant risk of committing suicide based on history,&#xD;
             routine psychiatric status examination, investigator's judgment, or who have an answer&#xD;
             of &quot;yes&quot; on questions 4 or 5 (current or over the last 3 months) on the&#xD;
             Baseline/Screening Version of the C-SSRS or participants with any suicidal behavior&#xD;
             during the 6 months prior to the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants currently in an acute relapse of schizophrenia as assessed by the&#xD;
             investigator. Bipolar participants who currently have an unstable mood (manic, mixed,&#xD;
             or depressed) as assessed by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a current DSM-5 diagnosis other than schizophrenia or bipolar&#xD;
             disorder, including schizoaffective disorder, major depressive disorder, delirium,&#xD;
             dementia, amnestic, or other cognitive disorders. Also, participants with borderline,&#xD;

          -  Use of any moderate-strong CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer within 14 days or 5 plasma&#xD;
             half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the administration of IMP and for the&#xD;
             duration of the trial. Weak CYP3A4 inhibitors, including valproic acid, may be allowed&#xD;
             based on the investigator's judgment, provided the participant has been on a stable&#xD;
             dose for at least 30 days prior to IMP administration and throughout the duration of&#xD;
             the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, seizure disorder, or&#xD;
             clinically significant tardive dyskinesia as assessed by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of any significant drug allergy or known or suspected&#xD;
             hypersensitivity to antipsychotics, in particular to quetiapine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are maintained on long-acting insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any participant who does not successfully tolerate a quetiapine dose of 300 mg BID&#xD;
             during the titration period of this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Part B:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of any significant drug allergy to quetiapine, prescription drugs,&#xD;
             non-prescription drugs, or food.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any history of significant bleeding or hemorrhagic tendencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exposure to any substances known to stimulate hepatic microsomal enzymes within 30&#xD;
             days prior to screening through the end of the trial (eg, occupational exposure to&#xD;
             pesticides, organic solvents, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have supine blood pressure after resting for ≥ 5 minutes, higher than&#xD;
             130/80 mmHg or lower than 100/50 mmHg (systolic/diastolic). The sponsor may allow&#xD;
             exceptions if they are not deemed clinically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have a supine pulse rate, after resting for ≥ 5 minutes, outside the&#xD;
             range of 60 to 90 beats per minute. The sponsor may allow exceptions if they are not&#xD;
             deemed clinically significant (eg, bradycardia attributable to superior physical&#xD;
             fitness).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of serious mental disorders that, in the opinion of the investigator, would&#xD;
             exclude the participant from participating in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any CYP3A4 inhibitors or CYP3A4 inducers within 14 days or 5 plasma half-lives&#xD;
             (whichever is longer) prior to the administration of IMP and for the duration of the&#xD;
             trial.&#xD;
