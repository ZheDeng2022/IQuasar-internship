  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single arm, phase II study to assess the effect of nilotinib reduced&#xD;
      to half the standard dose for 12 months on treatment-free remission in patients with Chronic&#xD;
      Myeloid Leukemia - Chronic Phase (CML-CP) treated with first-line nilotinib who reached a&#xD;
      sustained deep molecular response before entering the study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the rate of full treatment-free molecular&#xD;
      remission in a selected population of CML-CP patients treated with nilotinib at half the&#xD;
      standard dose during a consolidation period of 12 months, followed by complete therapy&#xD;
      cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is made up of 4 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening (week -4 - week 0)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nilotinib consolidation (week 0 - week 48)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nilotinib treatment-free remission (TFR) phase (week 48 - week 144)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow up phase Patients fulfilling this protocol-specific definition of sustained deep&#xD;
           molecular response (DMR) and all other inclusion/exclusion criteria will start the&#xD;
           consolidation phase of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Nilotinib consolidation (week 0 - week 48) period, patients will be treated with&#xD;
      nilotinib 300 mg QD. At the end or during the consolidation period, patients will proceed as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with sustained DMR at the end of the consolidation phase will enter the&#xD;
           tretament-free remission (TFR) phase and nilotinib will be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with loss of major molecular response (MMR) at any time during the&#xD;
           consolidation phase will enter the follow-up phase and will return to the standard&#xD;
           nilotinib administration regimen (nilotinib 300 mg BID) until the end of the trial (week&#xD;
           144). Loss of MMR is defined as breakpoint cluster region--c-abl oncogene 1 (BCR-ABL)&#xD;
           &gt;0.1% international scale assessed in a single blood sample and will mandate&#xD;
           reinitiation of nilotinib treatment at 300 mg BID within 5 weeks after the collection of&#xD;
           the blood sample demonstrating loss of MMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with more than MMR, but without meeting the definition of sustained DMR, will&#xD;
           remain in the consolidation phase and will be treated with nilotinib 300 mg QD until the&#xD;
           end of the trial (week 144).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the TFR phase, BCR-ABL levels will be monitored every month for the first year at&#xD;
      weeks 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, 80, 84, 88, 92, 96 and then every three months until the&#xD;
      end of the study at weeks 108, 120, 132 and 144 (end of study) or whenever clinically&#xD;
      indicated at the discretion of the investigator. The primary objective will be evaluated at&#xD;
      week 96. During the TFR phase, loss of MMR will cause reinitiation of nilotinib treatment at&#xD;
      300 mg BID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up phase for patients who were discontinued from the trial, starting from the date of&#xD;
      trial discontinuation up to the end of the trial (144 week), and for patients with loss of&#xD;
      MMR at any time during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients discontinued from the treatment for any reason will be followed for survival&#xD;
      information every 3 months until week 144.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients still on study treatment at the end of the study will be transitioned to&#xD;
      prescription nilotinib.&#xD;

             the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). The vasectomized male&#xD;
             partner should be the sole partner for that subject.&#xD;

             contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for example hormone&#xD;
             vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In case of use of oral contraception, women should have been stable on the same pill for a&#xD;
        minimum of 3 months before starting the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women are considered post-menopausal and not of childbearing potential if they have had 12&#xD;
        months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (i.e. age&#xD;
        appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy&#xD;
        (with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks&#xD;
        ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has&#xD;
        been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of childbearing&#xD;
        potential.&#xD;
