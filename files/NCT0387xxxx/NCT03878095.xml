  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well olaparib and ceralasertib (AZD6738) work in treating&#xD;
      patients with IDH mutant cholangiocarcinoma or solid tumors. Cancer is caused by changes&#xD;
      (mutations) to genes that control the way cells function. Laboratory studies have shown that&#xD;
      olaparib and AZD6738 can shrink IDH mutant tumors or stop them from growing. Olaparib and&#xD;
      ceralasertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for&#xD;
      cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the overall response rates of olaparib and ceralasertib (AZD6738) in subjects&#xD;
      with recurrent/progressive IDH1/2-mutant solid malignant tumors, who will be recruited to 2&#xD;
      cohorts: a. Cholangiocarcinoma b. Other solid malignant tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the progression free survival (PFS) of olaparib and AZD6738 in adults with&#xD;
      recurrent/progressive IDH1/2-mutant solid malignant tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the overall survival (OS) in adults with recurrent/progressive IDH1/2- mutant&#xD;
      solid malignant tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the duration of response in adults with recurrent/progressive IDH1/2-mutant&#xD;
      solid malignant tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of olaparib and AZD6738.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) concentration in plasma by mass spectrometry and&#xD;
      correlate with treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate 2HG levels in tumor biopsies prior to the beginning of treatment and while on&#xD;
      therapy and correlate with treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Correlate 2HG concentration in plasma and in tumor biopsies. IV. To evaluate&#xD;
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) double strand breaks (DSBs) as measured by mass cytometry time of&#xD;
      flight (CyTOF)-imaging mass cytometry (IMC) in tumor biopsies before and after treatment with&#xD;
      olaparib and AZD6738.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and ceralasertib PO once&#xD;
      daily (QD) on days 1-7. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be able to understand the nature of this trial and provide written&#xD;
             informed consent, prior to any study specific procedures. Patients with impaired&#xD;
             decision making capacity (IDMC) who have a close caregiver or legally authorized&#xD;
             representative (LAR) may be considered eligible for this study at the treating&#xD;
             physician's discretion, provided that the physician is reasonably sure that the&#xD;
             possible risks and benefits of the study are clear and that the patient will take the&#xD;
             drug as prescribed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be diagnosed with a cholangiocarcinoma or other solid malignant tumor&#xD;
             that has progressed despite standard therapy, or for which no effective standard&#xD;
             therapy exists. Patients with primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors, e.g.&#xD;
             glioma, are not allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have biopsy-confirmed evidence of an IDH1 or IDH2 mutation, confirmed in&#xD;
             a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA)-certified laboratory, associated with&#xD;
             neomorphic activity of the encoded proteins&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have tumors determined to be easily accessible for biopsy and must be&#xD;
             willing to have serial biopsies. Tumor biopsies will be performed on the most&#xD;
             accessible biopsiable site of disease. All possible precautions to avoid complications&#xD;
             will be taken, including discussions in multidisciplinary meetings, if needed. If a&#xD;
             patient opts out of a pre-treatment biopsy, biopsy is not possible, or if a&#xD;
             pre-treatment biopsy does not yield sufficient tissue for analysis, the patient must&#xD;
             be willing to provide an archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimen, if&#xD;
             available, for liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analysis of 2HG.&#xD;
             Permission of the study principal investigator (PI) is required in all of the above&#xD;
             scenarios&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In order to maximize the availability of newly obtained specimens for 2-HG&#xD;
                  analysis, at least 10 biopsies will be required in each group (cholangiocarcinoma&#xD;
                  and other solid tumors) of 14 patients treated in the first stage of this Simon&#xD;
                  two-stage design. Thus if 4 patients in an arm have already opted out, further&#xD;
                  patients may only enroll on that arm (in the first stage) if they agree to&#xD;
                  undergo the pre- and on-treatment biopsies. If a patient has agreed to undergo&#xD;
                  the two biopsies and undergoes the pre-treatment biopsy, he or she may not opt&#xD;
                  out of the second biopsy unless such a biopsy would not be safe (e.g.&#xD;
                  inaccessible tumor). Permission of the study PI is required in this scenario&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  All patients must be willing to provide 5 unstained archival slides, if&#xD;
                  available, for pre-treatment 2-HG analysis and correlation with 2-HG levels in&#xD;
                  pre-treatment frozen specimens&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be willing to undergo extra blood sampling for correlative studies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
             (RECIST) version (v)1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have at least one lesion, not previously irradiated, that can be&#xD;
             accurately measured at baseline as &gt;= 10 mm in the longest diameter (except lymph&#xD;
             nodes which must have short axis &gt;= 15 mm) with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic&#xD;
             resonance imaging (MRI) or &gt;= 10 mm with callipers by clinical exam OR at least one&#xD;
             lesion (measurable and/or non-measurable) that can be accurately assessed by&#xD;
             CT/MRI/clinical exam at baseline and follow up visits&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have progressive cancer at the time of study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior experimental (non-Food and Drug Administration [FDA] approved) therapies (other&#xD;
             than drugs that target ATR) and immunotherapies are allowed. Patients must not have&#xD;
             received these therapies for 30 days or five half lives of the drug (whichever is&#xD;
             less) prior to the initiation of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Toxicities from prior therapies should have recovered to =&lt; grade 1, with the&#xD;
             exception of stable chronic grade 2 toxicities that are not overlapping with presumed&#xD;
             toxicities of olaparib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if there is no evidence of&#xD;
             progression for at least 4 weeks after central nervous system (CNS)-directed&#xD;
             treatment, as ascertained by clinical examination and brain imaging (MRI or CT scan)&#xD;
             during the screening period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with new or progressive brain metastases (active brain metastases) or&#xD;
             leptomeningeal disease are eligible if the treating physician determines that&#xD;
             immediate CNS specific treatment is not required and is unlikely to be required for at&#xD;
             least 4 weeks (or scheduled assessment after the first cycle of treatment), and a&#xD;
             risk-benefit analysis (discussion) by the patient and the investigator favors&#xD;
             participation in the clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, HBV viral load must be&#xD;
             undetectable on suppressive therapy if indicated. If history of hepatitis C virus&#xD;
             (HCV) infection, must be treated with undetectable HCV viral load&#xD;

             clarithromycin, protease inhibitors boosted with ritonavir or cobicistat, indinavir,&#xD;
             saquinavir, nelfinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) or moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g.&#xD;
             ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, diltiazem, fluconazole, verapamil). The required washout&#xD;
             period prior to starting study treatment is 2 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant use of known strong (e.g. phenobarbital, enzalutamide, phenytoin,&#xD;
             rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine, carbamazepine, nevirapine and St John's Wort) or&#xD;
             moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g. bosentan, efavirenz, modafinil). The required washout&#xD;
             period prior to starting study treatment is 5 weeks for enzalutamide or phenobarbital&#xD;
             and 3 weeks for other agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persistent toxicities caused by previous cancer therapy. Toxicities should have&#xD;
             recovered to =&lt; grade 1, excluding alopecia, or should be stable chronic grade 2&#xD;
             toxicities that do not overlap with presumed toxicities of olaparib and/or AZD6738&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or&#xD;
             features suggestive of MDS/AML&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with new or progressive brain metastases (active brain metastases) or&#xD;
             leptomeningeal disease are not eligible if the treating physician determines that&#xD;
             immediate CNS specific treatment is required, and a risk-benefit analysis (discussion)&#xD;
             by the patient and the investigator does not favor participation in the clinical&#xD;
             trial. A scan to confirm the absence of brain metastases is not required. The patient&#xD;
             can receive a stable dose of corticosteroids before and during the study if these were&#xD;
             started at least 4 weeks prior to treatment. Patients with spinal cord compression&#xD;
             unless considered to have received definitive treatment for this and evidence of&#xD;
             clinically stable disease for 28 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery within 2 weeks of starting study treatment. Major surgeries typically&#xD;
             require general anesthesia, are associated with an estimated blood loss of &gt; 500 mL,&#xD;
             and require an overnight hospital stay. Examples include laparoscopic surgery, open&#xD;
             resection of organs, joint replacements and other orthopedic surgeries, and vascular&#xD;
             or intracranial surgeries. Examples of minor surgeries include those performed on an&#xD;
             ambulatory basis, cataract surgery, dental surgeries, cutaneous, endoscopic, and&#xD;
             arthroscopic procedures. Effects from major surgeries should have recovered to =&lt;&#xD;
             grade 1, with the exception of stable chronic grade 2 toxicities that are not&#xD;
             overlapping with presumed toxicities of olaparib and/or AZD6738&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients considered a poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical&#xD;
             disorder, non-malignant systemic disease or active, uncontrolled infection. Examples&#xD;
             include, but are not limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 3&#xD;
             months) myocardial infarction, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, unstable spinal&#xD;
             cord compression, superior vena cava syndrome, extensive interstitial bilateral lung&#xD;
             disease on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan or any psychiatric disorder&#xD;
             that prohibits obtaining informed consent and would limit compliance with study&#xD;
             requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients unable to swallow orally administered medication and patients with&#xD;
             gastrointestinal disorders likely to interfere with absorption of the study medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are actively breast feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a known hypersensitivity to olaparib or AZD6738 or any of the excipients&#xD;
             of the products. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar&#xD;
             chemical or biologic composition to olaparib or AZD6738&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant or double umbilical cord blood&#xD;
             transplantation (dUCBT)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Whole blood transfusions in the last 120 days prior to entry to the study (packed red&#xD;
             blood cells and platelet transfusions are acceptable within the last 28 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because olaparib is an agent with the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with olaparib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated&#xD;
             with olaparib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving, or having received during the 14 days prior to first dose, corticosteroids&#xD;
             (at a dose &gt; 10 mg prednisone/day or equivalent) for any reason&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any of the following cardiac diseases currently or within the last 6 months (by New&#xD;
             York Heart Association (NYHA) &gt;= class 2 where applicable):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Unstable angina pectoris&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Congestive heart failure or known reduced left ventricular ejection fraction&#xD;
                  (LVEF) &lt; 55%&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Acute myocardial infarction&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Conduction abnormality not controlled with pacemaker or medication e.g. complete&#xD;
                  left bundle branch block, third degree heart block&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Significant ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias e.g. (patients with&#xD;
                  chronic rate-controlled atrial fibrillation in the absence of other cardiac&#xD;
                  abnormalities are eligible)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients at risk of brain perfusion problems, e.g., medical history of carotid&#xD;
             stenosis or pre-syncopal or syncopal episodes, history of transient ischemic attacks&#xD;
             (TIAs)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontro&#xD;
