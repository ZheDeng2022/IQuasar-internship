  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a need for better preventive and abortive therapies for migraine. Previous research&#xD;
      has indicated that non-invasive neurostimulation may have prophylactic effects on migraine&#xD;
      and improve symptoms and functional outcomes in migraineurs. One such method is a&#xD;
      non-invasive transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). This double-blind randomized&#xD;
      sham-controlled two-parallel-arm study aims to evaluate efficacy and safety of tDCS&#xD;
      self-delivered in daily 20-minute applications for 2 months (60 days) by adult migraine&#xD;
      patients at home for migraine prevention and migraine symptom management, as compared to sham&#xD;
      tDCS application; and to evaluate patients' satisfaction with the procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will employ a double-blind randomized sham-controlled two-parallel-arm design and&#xD;
      involve 60 adults with migraine. For each participant, the study will involve 3 study visits&#xD;
      and last about 90 days (30 days of the baseline followed by 60 days of the tDCS/sham study&#xD;
      intervention). A post-study safety monitoring will continue bi-weekly by phone for 30 days&#xD;
      after the last tDCS/sham application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 1, patients will provide written informed consent and undergo screening for the&#xD;
      eligibility. This will be followed by 30 days of baseline at home during which patients will&#xD;
      keep daily records (Daily Diaries) of migraine occurrence and provide answers to a set of&#xD;
      symptom-related questionnaires. Patients with 4 or more migraine days per month who fully&#xD;
      meet the study eligibility criteria at the end of the baseline period will be randomized in&#xD;
      double-blind manner into two groups: Group 1 will be randomized to receive active tDCS in&#xD;
      daily 20-minute applications for 60 days; Group 2 will be randomized to receive sham tDCS in&#xD;
      daily 20-minute applications for 60 days, self-applied at home. Following randomization,&#xD;
      patients will continue keeping the Daily Diaries and Visit #2 will be held either in the&#xD;
      patient's home or in the research facility, based on the patient's preference. tDCS device&#xD;
      will be deployed to the patient and instructions on tDCS use will be provided. The first&#xD;
      tDCS/sham self-application by the patient will be done at Visit 2. Daily tDCS/sham&#xD;
      self-application by the patient at home and records in the form of Daily Diaries will&#xD;
      continue for the rest of the 60-day period. Study staff will be in regular remote contact&#xD;
      with the patient via phone and/or HIPAA-compliant videoconferencing. Upon conclusion of the&#xD;
      intervention, Visit 3 will be held either in the patient's home or in the research facility,&#xD;
      based on the patient's preference. tDCS device will be collected from the patient. Safety&#xD;
      monitoring will continue bi-weekly by phone for 30 days after the last tDCS/sham application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome assessment will be carried out at the end of the baseline, and at Day 30 (the&#xD;
      secondary time-point) and Day 60 (the primary time-point) of the tDCS/sham intervention.&#xD;
