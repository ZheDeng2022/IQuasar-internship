      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers want see if three new HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) vaccines are safe. Two&#xD;
      vaccines are carried by live adenoviruses, which are natural and typically cause cold&#xD;
      symptoms or an eye infection. Researchers want to see if all the vaccines help fight HIV and&#xD;
      if the adenoviruses are contagious.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the safety and effects of three new HIV vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults 18 49 years old (vaccinees)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Their household and intimate contacts 18 65 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccinees will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions about HIV risk&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccinees will learn how to prevent spreading the viruses and about required contraception&#xD;
      during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccinees will get consent forms for their household and intimate contacts. All contacts must&#xD;
      be age 18 65. All intimate contacts must sign a consent form. Contacts will have 4 visits&#xD;
      over 8 months for blood tests and a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All applicable participants will have a pregnancy test at every visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccinees will have about 9 visits over 12 months. They will repeat screening tests and get:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 of the 2 adenovirus vaccines sprayed in the nose at 2 visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      The booster vaccine by needle in an arm at 1 visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasal swabs taken at some visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccinees will note their temperature and symptoms for at least 1 4 weeks after each vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccinees may choose to have:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leukapheresis. Blood will be removed by needle in a vein in one arm. A machine will remove&#xD;
      white blood cells. The rest of the blood will be returned into the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Small pieces of the tonsil removed&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 study to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of adenovirus serotype 4&#xD;
      (Ad4)-based HIV vaccines when administered via the intranasal route to healthy human&#xD;
      volunteers. It is hypothesized that the vaccines will be safe for human administration and&#xD;
      will elicit immune responses to the HIV components. All study activities will be carried out&#xD;
      at the NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study vaccinee will receive 5x10^8 viral particles of either Ad4-Env150KN or&#xD;
      Ad4-Env145NFL, administered as an intranasal spray at months 0 and 2. An intramuscular&#xD;
      protein booster vaccination with the heterologous soluble trimeric protein&#xD;
      VRC-HIVRGP096-00-VP (Trimer 4571) with alum will be administered to all vaccinees at month 6.&#xD;
      Specimens to evaluate immunogenicity will be taken at baseline and at specified time points&#xD;
      through month 12. The HIV-specific immune responses will be assessed by cellular immune&#xD;
      function assays (intracellular cytokine analysis, flow cytometry-based killing assays), as&#xD;
      well as measures of humoral immunity (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] and&#xD;
      neutralization assays).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal will be to compare the safety and immunogenicity of the Ad-HIV vaccine&#xD;
      regimens. Participants who have previously received another HIV vaccine and/or are Ad4&#xD;
      seropositive will be enrolled into an exploratory arm to be analyzed separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Household contacts willing to participate and all intimate contacts (current and/or those&#xD;
      expected within the first 4 weeks after vaccination) will also be enrolled and monitored for&#xD;
      transmission of the vaccine virus by serology.&#xD;
