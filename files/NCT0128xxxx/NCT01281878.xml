    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators will prospectively analyze the reduction of urinary oxalate&#xD;
      excretion under the treatment with PLP in dosages of 5mg/kg/day up to 20 mg/kg/day and serum&#xD;
      level response relationship with PLP as an i.v. solution used orally in 12 patients with&#xD;
      primary hyperoxaluria type I as an inherited autosomal-recessive-disorder leading to&#xD;
      increased endogenous oxalate production, urolithiasis and end stage renal disease.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documentation of diagnosis of PH I by any one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Liver biopsy confirmation of deficient liver specific peroxisomal&#xD;
                  alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase, (AGT or mislocalization of AGT from&#xD;
                  peroxisomes to mitochondria)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for a known mutation in the causative&#xD;
                  gene (AGXT) for PH I&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female subjects between 5 years and 60 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Renal function defined as an estimated GFR &gt; 60 ml/min normalized to 1.73 m2 body&#xD;
             surface area&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects receiving pyridoxal-phosphate before the study must be willing to discontinue&#xD;
             therapy with pyridoxal-phosphate for a wash out phase of at least 4 weeks but always&#xD;
             until normalization of serum pyridoxal-phosphate levels&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent from patients and/or legally acceptable representatives&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating women&#xD;

             method with a pearl-index &lt; 1. Highly effective contraception methods are oral,&#xD;
             transdermal, injectable, or implanted contraceptives, IUD, abstinence, or sterile&#xD;
             sexual partner and must agree to continue using such precautions during the&#xD;
             pyridoxal-phosphate study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects post liver or kidney transplantation or combined transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic diarrhoea with the risk of malabsorption&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other abnormal finding such as physical examination or laboratory evaluation, in&#xD;
             the opinion of the investigator, is indicative of a disease that would compromise the&#xD;
             safety taking pyridoxal-phosphate per os and the absorption&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects participating in other clinical trials with investigational products 4 weeks&#xD;
             prior to trial entry, during the trial and 4 weeks after the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are unable to take the trial medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are unable to collect 24-hour urine samples or follow other study&#xD;
             procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are under treatment with L-Dopa, Isoniazid, D-Penicillamine (interactions&#xD;
             between these drugs and pyridoxal-phosphate are known and might influence serum&#xD;
             pyridoxal-phosphate levels)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with known allergies to substances of contents (e.g. Potassium sorbet,&#xD;
             raspberry syrup)&#xD;
