  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that fibromyalgia (FM) and painful diabetic peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy (pDPN) patients with access restrictions on pregabalin will lead to higher&#xD;
      healthcare resource use and cost compared to patients without such restrictions on pregabalin&#xD;
      in a naturalistic setting. The randomization will occur at the physician level and not the&#xD;
      patient level.&#xD;

      This trial was terminated prematurely on April 2, 2012, due to the inability to recruit the&#xD;
      planned number of subjects. The decision to terminate the trial was not based on any safety&#xD;
      or efficacy concerns.&#xD;

        There are six practice types that are expected to be able to provide patients to this&#xD;
        study. Of these, four (internal medicine, family/general practitioners, neurologists, and&#xD;
        anesthesia/pain physicians) will be expected to enroll patients into both pDPN and FM&#xD;
        disease groups. The fifth group, rheumatology physicians, will be expected to enroll&#xD;
        patients into the FM cohort only and the sixth group, endocrinologists, will be expected to&#xD;
        enroll patients into the pDPN cohort only.&#xD;
