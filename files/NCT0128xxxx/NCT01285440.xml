  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to show that improvements in the molecular breast imaging (MBI)&#xD;
      technology will allow reduction of the administered dose of Tc-99m sestamibi while&#xD;
      maintaining a sensitivity of 90% for tumor detection.&#xD;

      A total of 150 patients will be studied. Each patient will have a suspicious lesion on&#xD;
      mammogram, ultrasound or breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for which biopsy is&#xD;
      scheduled. The lesion size on mammogram, ultrasound or breast MRI must be less than 2 cm in&#xD;
      diameter and must be considered &quot;suspicious&quot; or &quot;highly suspicious&quot; for malignancy. Following&#xD;
      injection of 8 mCi Tc-99m sestamibi, all patients will undergo craniocaudal (CC) and&#xD;
      mediolateral oblique (MLO) views of each breast using a molecular breast imaging (MBI) system&#xD;
      incorporating the latest hardware and software algorithms. Each image will be acquired for 10&#xD;
      minutes in dynamic mode as 4 x 2.5 minute images. Summation of a given number of frames from&#xD;
      each acquisition will yield images of an increasing mCi dose. Hence with an 8 mCi injection&#xD;
      and a dynamic acquisition mode, we can evaluate the sensitivity of MBI as a function of&#xD;
      administered doses of Tc-99m sestamibi ranging from 2 to 8 mCi. The thickness of the breast&#xD;
      will be recorded to determine its relevance to lesion detectability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Selection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to enroll 150 female patients in this study. The rationale for a&#xD;
      study number of 150 patients is given in Appendix D. Patients referred for a mammogram,&#xD;
      ultrasound or breast MRI study at Mayo Clinic Rochester will be considered for the study if&#xD;
      they meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a lesion on mammogram, ultrasound or breast MRI that measured &lt; 2 cm and is&#xD;
           considered suspicious or highly suggestive of malignancy according to the Breast Imaging&#xD;
           Reporting and Data System Atlas criteria (BI-RADS 4 or 5). (Note: while 2 cm is larger&#xD;
           than the desired lesion size that we wish to study, this limit was recommended by our&#xD;
           radiology colleagues as estimates of lesion size from mammography, ultrasound and MRI&#xD;
           are not exact)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are scheduled for biopsy (needle and/or surgical biopsy) of the suspicious lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are &gt; 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Had a negative pregnancy test or must be postmenopausal or surgically sterilized&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be offered enrollment if the time interval between mammogram,&#xD;
      ultrasound or MRI and scheduled biopsy allows for performance of MBI. Patients with prior&#xD;
      needle biopsy of the lesion will be excluded from this study, as such biopsies may&#xD;
      effectively remove all or part of the lesion. Prospective patients will be identified by the&#xD;
      radiologist based on findings in their mammographic, ultrasound or MRI studies.&#xD;
