    <textblock>
      This was an open-label, balanced, randomized, two-treatment, four-period, two-sequence,single&#xD;
      dose, replicate crossover bioequivalence study in healthy, adult, human, male subjects under&#xD;
      fasting conditions.48 healthy male adults were enrolled.A washout period of 07 days was&#xD;
      maintained between the successive dosing days.One tablet containing mycophenolate mofetil 500&#xD;
      mg was administered orally with 240 mL water in sitting posture, after an overnight fast of&#xD;
      at least 10 hours in each period. This activity was followed by a mouth check to assess&#xD;
      compliance to dosing. The subjects were not allowed to lie down for the first three hours&#xD;
      after dosing.&#xD;
