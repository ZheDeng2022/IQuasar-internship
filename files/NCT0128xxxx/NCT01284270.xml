    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether some features of plaques in coronary&#xD;
      arteries predispose the heart muscle to injuries during angioplasty in patients with a&#xD;
      narrowing in at least one of the arteries that may need a stent placed during a heart&#xD;
      catheterization. Participants undergo a cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study&#xD;
      before the heart catheterization to look for scarring in the heart muscle. During the heart&#xD;
      catheterization, participants undergo an intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) exam to look at the&#xD;
      make-up of the plaques before the stent placement and the investigators will measure the&#xD;
      pressures in the arteries to look at how severe the blockage is. Within 30 days after the&#xD;
      heart catheterization, participants will have a second MRI done to look for any new scar in&#xD;
      the heart muscle.&#xD;
