      Background: Whether Supra-Fiber, a plum-derived fiber supplement is useful in the treatment&#xD;
      of constipation is not known. Supra Fiber is the first fiber supplement that has a blend of&#xD;
      whole food fruit as its main ingredient. It contains prunes, pomegranates, blueberries, and&#xD;
      Acai berries. Unlike psyllium, which is mostly (90%) insoluble fiber, Supra Fiber is a&#xD;
      balanced (50%) blend of insoluble and soluble fiber. This may provide the beneficial effects&#xD;
      of fiber, and eliminate potential adverse symptoms of fiber such as bloating, distention,&#xD;
      hard bulky stools and excess gas. In this study, we expect to not only evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      but also the palatability and tolerability of Supra Fiber in the treatment of chronic&#xD;
      constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate and compare the effects of Supra Fiber (5 grams BID) or psyllium (5 grams&#xD;
           BID) on the number of complete spontaneous bowel movements per week, and bowel symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine the effects of fiber supplements on taste and quality of life in adults with&#xD;
           functional chronic constipation in a randomized, double-blind, parallel group controlled&#xD;
           trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: We propose to enroll 90 subjects with functional constipation in a single blinded,&#xD;
      randomized, cross-over study comparing 4 weeks of Supra Fiber with 4 weeks of treatment with&#xD;
      Psyllium&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: The primary outcome measure will be the global relief of constipation symptoms&#xD;
      as rated by the subject at the end of each phase of the study. Additionally, we will assess&#xD;
      several secondary outcome measures that will include the number of Complete Spontaneous Bowel&#xD;
      Movements (CSBM) per week, Quality of Life , psychological profile, patient rating of taste&#xD;
      on a VAS scale, patient rating of bloating, distension, satiety and fullness and patient&#xD;
      rating of constipation-related symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: We anticipate that treatment with Supra Fiber will improve symptoms of&#xD;
      constipation compared to the baseline. This improvement will be comparable or superior to&#xD;
      that achieved with psyllium treatment. Additionally, Supra Fiber will offer a natural, food&#xD;
      based, convenient and more tasty alternative to over-the-counter laxatives and fiber&#xD;
      supplements.&#xD;

    <description>1. Number of Complete Spontaneous Bowel Movements (CSBM) per week. This will be analyzed from the daily stool diaries (Appendix 1). The CSBM provides a more robust and better assessment of the overall change in bowel function that takes into account not only the stool frequency but also the completeness and satisfaction with bowel function. A CSBM is defined as a bowel movement that is produced without the use of additional laxatives, suppositories or enemas in the previous 24 hours, other than the study medication.</description>
