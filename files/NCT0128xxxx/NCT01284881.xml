      Oral appliances, such as Mandibular Repositioning Appliances (MRA), have emerged as a&#xD;
      treatment option for sleep-disordered breathing (SDB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare active measurement of MRA compliance with patient's&#xD;
      self-report.&#xD;

      Background Oral appliances, such as Mandibular Repositioning Appliances (MRA), have emerged&#xD;
      as a conservative treatment option for sleep-disordered breathing (SDB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to this date, no objective method is available to measure compliance during oral appliance&#xD;
      treatment for SDB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As with CPAP in the early years, the sleep apnea community nowadays has a strong interest in&#xD;
      the objective measurement of oral appliance use and adherence. Subjective measures and&#xD;
      self-report commonly result in overestimation of compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods We will perform a 12-week clinical trial comparing active/objective measurement of&#xD;
      compliance with subjective self-reported usage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will enroll 50 patients with an established diagnosis of SDB that received treatment with&#xD;
      a titratable, duobloc MRA (RespiDent Butterfly® MRA, RespiDent, Nijlen, Belgium).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active microsensors (TheraMon®,Handelsagentur Gschladt, Hargelsberg, Oostenrijk) are provided&#xD;
      by the Handelsagentr Gschladt (Hargelsberg, Oostenrijk) without any costs. The sampling&#xD;
      interval of the recording will be done at a rate of 1 measurement per 15 minutes (every 900&#xD;
      seconds). Using this sample interval, the capacity of the active microsensor allows for data&#xD;
      acquisition during a 100 day period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The microsensors are intercalated into the MRA devices by the dental technician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive explanation to the purpose of the study, in the fact that the&#xD;
      investigators want to study temperature fluctuations during the night in the oral cavity. As&#xD;
      a result, the subjects are unaware that their MRA use and compliance is being measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A first follow-up appointment is scheduled after the first 4 weeks. A second and final&#xD;
      follow-up visit is scheduled again 12 weeks after the start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each follow-up visit patients are asked to fill out a questionnaire containing&#xD;
      questions about MRA wear during the last 4 or 8 weeks (mean hours/night, mean nights/week),&#xD;
      respectively. The objective measurement of MRA wear time (total hours of wear time and the&#xD;
      mean hours of wear per night over the respective period) will be based on the assumption that&#xD;
      the MRA has been worn when the chip records a temperature intraorally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study design will provide a 12-week evaluation of all patients (n=50).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspective and Hypothesis The removable nature of an oral appliance warrants an objective&#xD;
      assessment of the effective use and compliance with overnight MRA treatment for SDB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that objective compliance might turn out to be significantly lower compared to&#xD;
      the subjectively reported compliance.&#xD;
