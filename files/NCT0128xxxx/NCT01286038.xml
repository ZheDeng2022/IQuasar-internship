  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of eltrombopag in people who&#xD;
      have myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with thrombocytopenia who have progressed or are&#xD;
      resistant to decitabine or azacitidine. (These are the only 2 drugs approved by the U.S. Food&#xD;
      and Drug Administration [FDA] which can improve platelet counts). The investigators (the&#xD;
      study doctor, study staff, and sponsor) want to find out what effects, good or bad,&#xD;
      eltrombopag (study drug) may have on people with low platelet counts due to MDS. The&#xD;
      investigators will also be testing how well eltrombopag may work at different doses in these&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;

      Study drug will be administered on an outpatient basis. The study is divided into two parts:&#xD;
      in Stage 1 the best dose of eltrombopag will be found to take forward to Stage 2. In Stage 1&#xD;
      of the study, small groups of participants will be enrolled in steps. The first group will be&#xD;
      given a dose of 50 mg per day of study drug for 8 weeks. If these participants have few or&#xD;
      manageable side effects, the next group of participants enrolled will receive a higher dose&#xD;
      of study drug (100 mg per day for 8 weeks). This increase in doses with groups of&#xD;
      participants will continue until the study doctor finds the highest dose of study drug that&#xD;
      can be given without causing severe or unmanageable side effects up to a 300 mg daily dose.&#xD;
      Stage 2 will include 15 participants at the best dose based on the Stage 1 part of the study.&#xD;
      The participant's dose may be adjusted to a lower or higher dose based upon their platelet&#xD;
      count, which will be determined by the study doctor. Eltrombopag will be supplied by a&#xD;
      company called GlaxoSmithKline as white to off-white, round film coated tablets containing&#xD;
      eltrombopag equivalent to 12.5mg, 25mg, 50 mg, 75 mg and 100 mg of eltrombopag.&#xD;
