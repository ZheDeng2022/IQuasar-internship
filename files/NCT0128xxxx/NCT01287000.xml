      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There has been little research on the long-term health effects from oil spills, even&#xD;
           though at least 10 percent of all oil tanker spills between 1970 and 2009 have affected&#xD;
           coastal populations. The Deepwater Horizon disaster, with its release of approximately 5&#xD;
           million barrels (~680,000 tons) of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico, is far larger than&#xD;
           any of the individual tanker spills. Given the magnitude of this spill and the scope of&#xD;
           the potential exposures, including the 55,000 workers involved in clean-up efforts and&#xD;
           countless residents of the affected areas, researchers are interested in monitoring Gulf&#xD;
           clean-up workers to understand the adverse consequences of oil spills in general.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Gulf Long-term Follow-up Study will investigate health effects associated with the&#xD;
           clean-up activities following the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico on&#xD;
           April 20, 2010. More than 100,000 persons completed safety training in preparation for&#xD;
           participation in clean-up activities related to the spill. Many of these individuals&#xD;
           participated in active clean-up efforts, but others did not. Exposures among persons&#xD;
           involved in clean-up range from negligible to potentially significant, especially for&#xD;
           workers involved in tasks associated with direct exposure to crude or burning oil, or to&#xD;
           chemical dispersants. However, prediction of adverse health effects is not possible&#xD;
           because the long-term human health consequences of oil spills are largely unknown. In&#xD;
           addition to the oil itself, the widespread economic and lifestyle disruption caused by&#xD;
           the oil spill may contribute to mental health problems among this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To investigate potential short- and long-term health effects associated with clean-up&#xD;
      activities and exposures surrounding the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - English-, Spanish-, and Vietnamese-speaking workers and volunteers at least 21 years of age&#xD;
      engaged or potentially engaged in oil spill clean-up operations in the Gulf of Mexico, or who&#xD;
      lived in affected areas (Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida coastal regions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be divided into groups of those who performed oil-spill&#xD;
           clean-up-related work ( exposed ) and those who did not engage in clean-up-related work&#xD;
           ( unexposed controls).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a full medical history and physical examination, as&#xD;
           well as an interview to determine the nature of their potential exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide blood, hair, toenail, urine, and saliva (spit) samples.&#xD;
           Participants may also have a lung function exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have researchers collect dust from their homes by using wipes and&#xD;
           special vacuum bags.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will also provide detailed contact information, including their Social&#xD;
           Security number, to be contacted in the future for long-term health follow-up&#xD;
           appointments. These appointments will include 30-minute telephone interviews every 2&#xD;
           years.&#xD;

      The Gulf Long-term Follow-up Study (GuLF STUDY) will investigate potential short- and&#xD;
      long-term health effects associated with the clean-up activities following the Deepwater&#xD;
      Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010. Crude oil, burning oil, and the&#xD;
      dispersants used during clean-up efforts contain a range of known and suspected toxins. Over&#xD;
      100,000 persons have completed safety training in preparation for participation in clean-up&#xD;
      activities related to the spill. While many of these individuals participated in active&#xD;
      clean-up efforts, others did not. Exposures among persons involved in clean-up range from&#xD;
      negligible to potentially significant, especially for workers involved in tasks associated&#xD;
      with direct exposure to crude or burning oil, or to chemical dispersants. However, prediction&#xD;
      of adverse health effects is not possible because the long-term human health consequences of&#xD;
      oil spills are largely unknown due to the dearth of research in this area. The potential&#xD;
      health effects associated with the levels of exposure experienced by clean-up workers are&#xD;
      largely unstudied. Heat and stress experienced by these workers may also have adverse&#xD;
      long-term health effects. In addition to the oil itself, the widespread economic and&#xD;
      lifestyle disruption caused by the oil spill may contribute to mental health problems among&#xD;
      this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The over-arching hypotheses of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Exposure to constituents of oil, dispersants, and oil-dispersant mixtures, and to&#xD;
           spill-related stress by workers engaged in clean-up of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill&#xD;
           are associated with adverse health effects, particularly respiratory, neurological,&#xD;
           hematologic, and psychological or mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There are exposure-response relationships between the above exposures and health&#xD;
           effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Biomarkers of potentially adverse biologic effects are associated with the above&#xD;
           exposures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on what is known about individuals involved in clean-up efforts, the cohort will&#xD;
      consist primarily of English-, Spanish-, or Vietnamese-speaking adults who performed&#xD;
      oil-spill clean-up-related work ( exposed ) and similar persons who did not engage in&#xD;
      clean-up-related work ( unexposed controls). Accommodations for enrolling participants&#xD;
      speaking other languages will be developed through community collaborations as appropriate.&#xD;
      Workers will be sampled from across job/potential exposure groups. A total of approximately&#xD;
      55,000 persons are expected to be enrolled into the cohort. A random sample of the full&#xD;
      cohort, stratified by category of job/potential exposure (including N~6,000 with no oil-spill&#xD;
      work to serve as controls) and oversampled for workers with higher potential exposures, will&#xD;
      be enrolled into an Active Follow-up Sub-cohort (N~20,000). A random sample of the Active&#xD;
      Follow-up Sub-cohort, also stratified by category of job/potential exposure and oversampled&#xD;
      for workers with higher potential exposures, will be enrolled into a Biomedical Surveillance&#xD;
      Sub-cohort (N~5,000). Participants will be interviewed about their clean-up-related tasks,&#xD;
      demographic and socioeconomic factors, occupational and health histories, psychosocial&#xD;
      factors, and physical and mental health. Members of the Active Follow-up Sub-cohort will also&#xD;
      be asked to provide biological samples (blood, urine, hair, toenail clippings, and possibly&#xD;
      saliva) and environmental samples (house dust) and will have basic clinical measurements&#xD;
      (height, weight, waist and hip circumference, blood pressure, urinary glucose levels, FEV1&#xD;
      and FVC as a measure of pulmonary function) taken during home visits at baseline. The&#xD;
      Biomedical Surveillance Sub-cohort will participate in a more comprehensive clinical&#xD;
      assessment after the initial home visit, including more comprehensive pulmonary function&#xD;
      testing, neurological testing, and collection of additional biological and environmental&#xD;
      samples. The specific tests to be performed and clinical protocols will be developed in&#xD;
      collaboration with extramural investigators selected through a request for proposals (RFP).&#xD;
      When developed, the protocol for this portion of the study will be submitted separately to&#xD;
      the Institutional Review Board as a study amendment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposures will be estimated using detailed job-exposure matrices developed from data from&#xD;
      monitoring performed by different agencies and organizations during the crisis, as well as&#xD;
      information on recommended or actual use of personal protection, information obtained by&#xD;
      interview, and the available scientific literature. It should be noted that, in the absence&#xD;
      of individual or group monitoring data for most workers, estimates of exposure, whether based&#xD;
      on job activities or on more refined job-exposure matrices, will indicate the degree of&#xD;
      potential exposure (i.e., exposure opportunity) rather than known exposure. We will&#xD;
      investigate acute health effects via self-report from the enrollment interview among all&#xD;
      cohort members and also via clinical measures and biological samples from Active Follow-up&#xD;
      Sub-cohort members. All cohort members will be followed for development of a range of health&#xD;
      outcomes through record linkage (cancer, mortality) and if feasible, through linkage with&#xD;
      electronic medical records that may become available during the course of follow-up. Health&#xD;
      outcomes among the Active Follow-up Sub-cohort will also be identified through self-report&#xD;
      via periodic follow-up interviews. Additional outcome information will be obtained on the&#xD;
      Biomedical Surveillance Sub-cohort from periodic follow-up clinical evaluations (e.g.,&#xD;
      spirometry, neurological testing) and analysis of follow-up biospecimens (e.g., immunologic&#xD;
      parameters, liver function, renal function, DNA damage). Follow-up of the entire cohort is&#xD;
      initially planned for 10 years, with extended follow-up possible depending upon scientific&#xD;
      and public health needs and the availability of funds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of subjects should begin in March 2011, with the telephone interviews expected to&#xD;
      be completed within 12-24 months and the baseline home visits within 18-26 months. For the&#xD;
      home visits, we will initially target workers residing in the four most affected Gulf States&#xD;
      (LA, MS, AL, and FL), although we may expand to other states if further information about the&#xD;
      geographic distribution of workers and their potential exposures warrants additional&#xD;
      follow-up in these states. We will work closely with a Community Advisory Board to develop&#xD;
      community support for this study and appropriate communications and study materials.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        We anticipate screening as many as 90,000 individuals in order to recruit approximately&#xD;
        55,000 volunteers primarily from the four most affected Gulf States* (LA, MS, AL, and FL)&#xD;
        into the cohort, which will include a randomly sampled Active Follow-up Sub-cohort of&#xD;
        approximately 24,000 individuals nested within it. Eligibility criteria for the cohort&#xD;
        include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  21 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fall into one of two oil-related exposure categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Potentially exposed subjects must have completed at least one day of oil-spill&#xD;
                  clean-up-related work (other than safety training), either paid or volunteer.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Unexposed subjects will be individuals who were not directly involved in oil&#xD;
                  spill clean-up activities, but who worked near the oil spill or completed some&#xD;
                  oil spill worker training.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unexposed subjects will be individuals who were not directly involved in oil spill&#xD;
             clean-up activities, but who worked near the oil spill or completed some oil spill&#xD;
             worker training.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  pregnant women will be allowed to enroll in the study, and women who become pregnant&#xD;
             during the study will not be withdrawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children will not be enrolled because they were not allowed to participate in clean-up&#xD;
             activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those who were deemed medically ineligible to participate in clean-up activities&#xD;
             because of pre-existing conditions are excluded because they won t be representative&#xD;
             of those individuals who were engaged in clean-up activities.&#xD;
