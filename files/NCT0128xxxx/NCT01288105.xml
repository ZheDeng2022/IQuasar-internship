      The specific aim of this proposal is to examine the impact of OCT and IVUS-guided management&#xD;
      of patients with prior DES implantation who need major non-cardiac surgery and&#xD;
      discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy on the perioperative (1 week prior to surgery&#xD;
      until 30 days post surgery) incidence of major adverse cardiac events.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who receive drug-eluting stents (DES) and subsequently require non-cardiac surgery&#xD;
      have increased risk for perioperative stent thrombosis, especially when antiplatelet therapy&#xD;
      discontinuation is required. Perioperative administration of a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa&#xD;
      inhibitor may decrease the stent thrombosis risk, but it is cumbersome and carries high cost.&#xD;
      Stents that have been endothelialized by optical coherence tomography (OCT) are likely to&#xD;
      have low risk for perioperative stent thrombosis and therefore intensive management&#xD;
      strategies, such as &quot;bridging with a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor&quot; would not be required.&#xD;
      The current study will assess whether OCT utilization can help optimize the preoperative&#xD;
      management of DES patients requiring major non-cardiac surgery.&#xD;

      The specific aim of this proposal is to examine the impact of OCT and IVUS-guided management&#xD;
      of patients with prior DES implantation who need major non-cardiac surgery and&#xD;
      discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy on the perioperative (1 week prior to surgery&#xD;
      until 30 days post surgery) incidence of major adverse cardiac events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that OCT and IVUS-guided treatment will have low incidence (≤10%) of&#xD;
      perioperative major adverse cardiac events.&#xD;
