      The purpose of this study is to assess the extent to which a culturally appropriate,&#xD;
      self-management intervention that combines patient education with a patient outreach liaison&#xD;
      strategy improves outcomes associated with type-2 diabetes among low-income diabetic women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, the prevalence of diabetes has significantly increased among women and&#xD;
      because of the expected fast growth rate of minority populations, the number of women in&#xD;
      these groups who will be diagnosed with diabetes is also expected to increase significantly&#xD;
      over the coming years. Among women from minority groups diabetes is the fourth leading cause&#xD;
      of death while it is the seventh among non-Hispanic White females. Non-compliance to diabetes&#xD;
      self-care is a major concern for type 2 diabetic women of racial/ethnic groups because of the&#xD;
      existing socio-economic and environmental barriers. Often, these women live in poverty; have&#xD;
      less than a high school education as well as language barriers and inadequate health&#xD;
      literacy, which further place them at risk for complications, and the daily activities of&#xD;
      diabetes self-care are implemented within the context of family responsibilities and&#xD;
      patient's priorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a 12-month randomized controlled trial designed to compare a lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention group (combination group) and a control group (education only group).&#xD;
      Participants assigned to either group will receive three group education sessions (baseline,&#xD;
      3 and 6 months) with an emphasis on self-management.&#xD;
