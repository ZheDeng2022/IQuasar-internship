  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with Cancer or congenital heart disease (CHD) experience complex, physical,&#xD;
      psychosocial and behavioural symptoms and problems due to the illness, treatment, and medical&#xD;
      procedures. To help children cope with their problems and prevent psychological distress, the&#xD;
      investigators developed SiSom, a support system to help children with cancer or CHD report&#xD;
      their symptoms and problems in an age-adjusted manner on a touch-pad, portable computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This quasi-experimental study with 202 children age 7-12 with CHD or cancer will test the&#xD;
      following hypotheses: When children use SiSom to report their symptoms and problems, and this&#xD;
      information is provided to their clinicians in their outpatient consultations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children and parents will experience less anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children and parents will be more satisfied with the outpatient visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There will be greater congruence between children's reported symptoms and problems and&#xD;
           those addressed by their clinicians as evidenced in documented patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To better understand the mechanisms by which these effects may occur, the investigators will&#xD;
      also explore:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Differences between control and experimental groups in patient-provider communication in&#xD;
           terms of instrumental and affective behaviour, participation, initiative and person&#xD;
           addressed;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The relationships among outcomes of patient-provider communication, congruence between&#xD;
           patients' reported symptoms and those addressed by their clinicians and children's and&#xD;
           parents' anxiety and satisfaction; and how these relationships differ between treatment&#xD;
           and control conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the investigators will investigate time requirements, ease of use and usefulness of&#xD;
      SiSom by children and clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For analyses the investigators will use inferential statistics and qualitative analyses of&#xD;
      the video-taped consultation sessions. This study will contribute to improving&#xD;
      patient-centred care for a particularly vulnerable population, and to a better understanding&#xD;
      of the triadic communication and interactions among child-parent and clinician.&#xD;
