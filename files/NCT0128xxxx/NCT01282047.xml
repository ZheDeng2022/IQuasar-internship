      Lenakap : This multicenter, non randomized (single arm), open, phase II study aims to&#xD;
      evaluated the efficacy of Lenalidomide in HIV-associated kaposi disease. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed for 48 weeks. Measurement of primary endpoint will be at 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The observation period is 48 weeks. The main criteria is evaluated at 24 weeks Inclusion&#xD;
      period: 72 weeks from the setting-up meeting.Lenalidomide will be stopped in the case of&#xD;
      progression and the patients will be considered as drop-out from the trial, but will be taken&#xD;
      into account in the final analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two-steps procedure: 14 evaluable patients in the first step; if one response to treatment is&#xD;
      observed, other patients are included up to 25 evaluable patients.&#xD;
