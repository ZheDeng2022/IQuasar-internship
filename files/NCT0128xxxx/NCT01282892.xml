      Abstract Background: Visceral fat or peri-omental fat is increasingly associated with&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome, a condition carrying a high risk of coronary artery disease. The&#xD;
      independent role of Visceral Fat in cardiovascular risk remains unclear. Aim: Evaluate the&#xD;
      relationship between visceral fat, fatty liver and asymptomatic coronary atherosclerosis in&#xD;
      patients with the major cardiovascular risk factors and with or without metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 50 patients (age 53±7) with excess of visceral fat visceral, 30 patients with NAFLD&#xD;
      and 30 sex, age matched individuals without NAFLD will be recruited . All will be&#xD;
      asymptomatic for cardiac related symptoms. Subjects with clinical history of ischemic heart&#xD;
      disease, cerebrovascular disease, renal failure, cancer and allergy to lode will be excluded.&#xD;
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) will be defined as coronary plaques, with obstructive (70%) or&#xD;
      non obstructive lesions (30%). Degree of fatty infiltration (ultrasound), Visceral fat amount&#xD;
      (CT), coronary plaques and stenosis (coronary computed tomography angiography,CCTA), markers&#xD;
      of insulin resistance,lipotoxicity, systemic inflammation, and oxidant-antioxidant status&#xD;
      will be measured measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Results: Patients with excess of visceral fat and patients with NAFLD will have&#xD;
      higher prevalence of coronary plaques and higher prevalence of non obstructive coronary&#xD;
      stenosis, higher HOMA CRP, and TG serum levels than controls. In patients with excess of&#xD;
      visceral fat , more segments with atherosclerosis per patient will be detected . Multiple&#xD;
      regression analysis is expected to show that visceral fat and fatty liver are strong&#xD;
      predictors of coronary atherosclerosis independently by metabolic syndrome diagnosis and&#xD;
      independently by markers of insulin resistance, lipotoxicity and inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: Patients with excess of visceral fat and NAFLD patients will have higher&#xD;
      prevalence of coronary atherosclerosis plaques independently by metabolic syndrome diagnosis.&#xD;
      Suggesting that the presence of visceral fat and/or fatty liver will be considered an&#xD;
      important condition to optimize the cardiovascular risk stratification.&#xD;
