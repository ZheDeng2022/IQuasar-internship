  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2190915 is under development as an oral controller for the treatment of adult and&#xD;
      pediatric asthma. This study is an open label, single and repeat dose escalation study, in&#xD;
      children with asthma. It will investigate the pharmacokinetics of GSK2190915 in children,&#xD;
      aged from 1 to 12 years old inclusive, to determine how the dosage regimen for GSK2190915 in&#xD;
      a pediatric population should be adjusted to achieve approximately the same level of systemic&#xD;
      exposure that is safe and effective in adults.&#xD;

      Subjects will be recruited into 2 cohorts, Cohort 1 with children from 4 years of age to less&#xD;
      than 12 years of age and cohort 2 with children from 1 year of age to less than 4 years of&#xD;
      age. Cohort 1 is further subdivided, dependent on a subject's weight, which enables different&#xD;
      dosing regimens and pharmacokinetic sampling within the cohort. There are 3 scheduled&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic and Safety Review meetings, which enable dose adjustment and dosing in the&#xD;
      younger subjects through the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine are collected for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis. Safety will&#xD;
      be assessed by measurement of heart rate, blood pressure, ECG, safety laboratory data and&#xD;
      review of adverse events. Subjects will also perform PEF and Spirometry if assessed as&#xD;
      capable by the study investigator.&#xD;
