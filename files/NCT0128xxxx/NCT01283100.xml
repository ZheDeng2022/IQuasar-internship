    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label, three-period, fixed-sequence cross over study in healthy&#xD;
      adult subjects. A total of approximately 16 healthy subjects will be enrolled to provide data&#xD;
      from 12 evaluable subjects. Subjects will have a screening visit within 30 days prior to the&#xD;
      first dose of study drug, three treatment periods, and a follow-up visit 7-14 days after the&#xD;
      last dose of study drug. There will be a washout period between Period 1 and Period 2 but no&#xD;
      washout between Period 2 and Period 3. Day 1 of Period 3 will be the day after Day 5 of&#xD;
      Period 2.&#xD;

             tests, and electrocardiograms (ECGs).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference&#xD;
             range for the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator and&#xD;
             the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional&#xD;
             risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female between 18 and 55 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the&#xD;

             (removal of the ovaries) or hysterectomy, or is post-menopausal defined as 12 months&#xD;
             of spontaneous amenorrhea. A follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level will be&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Unwilling to refrain from the use of illicit drugs and adhere to other protocol-stated&#xD;
             restrictions while participating in the study.&#xD;

             heparin-induced thrombocytopenia should not be enrolled.&#xD;

             heart rate is outside the range of 50-100 beats per minute (bpm) for female subjects&#xD;
