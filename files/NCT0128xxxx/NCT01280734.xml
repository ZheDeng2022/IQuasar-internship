        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The subject must have signed an informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The subject is a healthy man or woman. Women of child bearing potential or within two&#xD;
             years of menopause must have negative urine pregnancy test at screening and use&#xD;
             contraceptives as indicated in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The subject is 55 to 64 years of age (extremes included).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The subject has a BMI &gt;19 kg/m2 and &lt; 30 kg/m2 at the Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The subject has a normal circadian rhythm, defined as a person who usually wakes&#xD;
             between 06:00 and 09:00 and goes to sleep between 21:00 and 24:00.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The subject is, in the opinion of the investigator, generally healthy based on&#xD;
             assessment of medical history and examination at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The subject is affiliated with, or beneficiary of a social security system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Major Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The subject has taken disallowed medication within 1 week prior to the first dose of&#xD;

             CYP pathways, such as St. John's Wort (except for hormonal contraceptives or hormonal&#xD;
             substitution therapy). Subjects who have taken any non-prescribed systemic or topical&#xD;
             medication may still be entered into the study if, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             the medication will not interfere with the study procedures, study results, or&#xD;
             compromise safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The subject weighs &gt;136 kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The subject cannot stand erect and unsupported for more than 2 to 3 minutes or loses&#xD;
             balance when standing on a fixed surface with eyes opened.&#xD;

             cups or glasses daily).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The subject has a presence or history of alcohol abuse defined as alcohol consumption&#xD;
             greater than 21 units per week for men and greater than 14 units per week for women;&#xD;
             or a presence or history of drug abuse within the last 6 months, or a history of&#xD;
             substance abuse deemed relevant by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The subject has taken any investigational products including these IMPs (zolpidem,&#xD;
             melatonin) within 3 months prior to admission on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The subject has taken these IMPs earlier in this clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The subject has known hypersensitivity to the melatonin, zolpidem or their excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The subject has a history of severe drug allergy or hypersensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. The subject is pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. The subject has a presence or history of sleep disorder, fainting, cardiovascular&#xD;
             diseases, carotid sinus syndrome, relevant dizziness or arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. The subject has a history of or presence of any clinically relevant immunological,&#xD;
             cardiovascular, pulmonary, metabolic, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal,&#xD;
             endocrinological, haematological, dermatological, venereal, neurological, systemic,&#xD;
             ocular or psychiatric or infectious disease or other major disorder, or sign of acute&#xD;
             illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. The subject has a history of cancer, other than basal cell or Stage 1 squamous cell&#xD;
             carcinoma of the skin, which has not been in remission for at least 5 years before the&#xD;
             first dose of IMP.&#xD;
