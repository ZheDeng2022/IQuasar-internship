  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alloimmunization to blood products in transfused patients is a recognized management&#xD;
      challenge in the clinical setting. In particular the ethnic and racial specificity of RBC&#xD;
      antigens and the limited availability of matched healthy volunteer blood donors have&#xD;
      intensified the dilemma. The presence of low prevalence clinically significant RBC antigens&#xD;
      among minorities account for the higher rate of alloimmunization observed in patients from&#xD;
      this group. This is partly due to the racial and ethnic differences between the blood donor&#xD;
      and recipient populations in the U.S.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The increasing number of new Ethiopian-American immigrants in the US presenting to the health&#xD;
      care system with blood transfusion requirements makes understanding the unique transfusion&#xD;
      needs of this minority population imperative. Although the majority of African Americans&#xD;
      claim origin to West Africa, Ethiopians, being from East Africa, represent a rapidly growing&#xD;
      population in the United States. Furthermore, identifying genetic similarities and&#xD;
      disparities to their West African counterparts will certainly have clinical implications in&#xD;
      terms of transfusion support and disease modifiers. This additional information would help in&#xD;
      understanding the natural history and transfusion requirements of certain debilitating&#xD;
      diseases, such as Sickle Cell Disease (SCD), which are known to occur more commonly in&#xD;
      African Americans. Identifying ethnically and racially similar individuals could assist in&#xD;
      recruiting healthy volunteer donors with similar RBC antigen profiles potentially&#xD;
      supplementing the rare donor pool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although extensive archeological and sporadic serologic RBC antigen studies have been&#xD;
      conducted in Ethiopia, there are no population wide RBC antigen molecular studies. Our study&#xD;
      population is selected by altitude and migration history. Ethiopia, being in close proximity&#xD;
      to the Red Sea in the northeast, Indian Ocean in the southeast and the rest of Africa in the&#xD;
      south/west has diverse population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a population based analysis of genetic variation of blood group antigens in&#xD;
      three distinct and conserved Ethiopian sub-populations. Statistical analysis using Chi-square&#xD;
      tests will be performed for each blood group antigen to detect differences in the&#xD;
      distribution between the three sub-populations. The The Lead Associate Investigator (LAI),&#xD;
      and, as appropriate, additional Investigators, will travel to Ethiopia to collect blood&#xD;
      samples, which will be analyzed in the Department of Transfusion Medicine (DTM) at the&#xD;
      National Institutes of Health (NIH) using the standard serologic methods and currently&#xD;
      available molecular genotyping systems. Samples will also be stored for future high&#xD;
      throughput sequencing analysis and other studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a systematic analysis of the distribution of blood group antigens in&#xD;
      Ethiopian sub-populations. Furthermore, new variants could be detected allowing insight into&#xD;
      the correlation of particular genotypes and phenotypes.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy Volunteers &gt;= 18 year of age. Volunteer healthy donors above the age of 18 years,&#xD;
        who have lived in the area since birth, and are at least 6 or 7 generation from endogenous&#xD;
        families in the region, will be recruited. A detailed ancestral line of descent (pedigree)&#xD;
        is not mandatory to the study and will not be performed. Individuals residing in rural&#xD;
        regions are mostly conserved and it may be possible that some donors could be closely&#xD;
        related. However, to identify as diverse a population of potential blood donors as&#xD;
        possible, and avoid dilution of ancestral genes blood samples will be collected from&#xD;
        individuals known to reside in the region for generations and not known to be closely&#xD;
        related. Donors will be recruited through the local schools, churches, and community&#xD;
        organizations. The oral consent will include a question where each donor will be asked if&#xD;
        anyone in his/her family is also donating a sample, and, if so, how close the relationship&#xD;
        is to that individual. Blood collection will be on a firstcome, first serve basis;&#xD;
        individuals will be made aware that only one person among a group of close relatives will&#xD;
        be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals &lt; 18 years of age will be excluded from the study. The study is a population&#xD;
        study and the information obtained from individuals above 18 years is not expected to be&#xD;
        different from those who are under 18 years old. Also, the need to involve adults to&#xD;
        consent individuals under 18 years old would be complicated. All donors should be healthy&#xD;
        volunteer individuals at the time of sample collection. Any potential donor with physical&#xD;
        and mental disability, individuals with known infectious and/or non-infectious diseases,&#xD;
        and pregnant women, are excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The study will be conducted in coordination with Addis Ababa University Medical Faculty and&#xD;
        the regional Health Offices in collaboration with Ethiopian Red Cross. The local PI, Dr.&#xD;
        Amha Gebgremedhin, is a member of the Addis Ababa University Medical faculty, Department of&#xD;
        Hematology, residing in Addis Ababa. The local health centers in the three regions listed&#xD;
        above will be used as centers for sample collection.&#xD;
