  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at investigating the effects of maternal depressive symptomatology on&#xD;
      pregnancy outcomes and newborn development. How paternal psychopathology is involved in the&#xD;
      association will also be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a three-year prospective cohort study. Three versions of questionnaires (the mother,&#xD;
      the father, and the infant) will be developed first. For parents, data on self-reported&#xD;
      symptomatology such as depression, anxiety, and stress will be collected, while for infants,&#xD;
      maternal report on newborn development will be measured. Then, two medical centers and two&#xD;
      regional hospitals will be selected. All pregnant women who undergo a first-trimester&#xD;
      prenatal visit, who plan to carry the baby till term, and whose spouse is also willing to&#xD;
      participate will be invited to join the study. The investigators expect to recruit a total of&#xD;
      194 pairs of depressive mothers and her spouses and 278 pairs of non-depressive mothers and&#xD;
      her spouses in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the informed consent is obtained, one baseline assessment (i.e., the first trimester)&#xD;
      and four follow-up assessments (i.e., the second trimester, the third trimester, one month&#xD;
      postnatal and six months postnatal) will be implemented. Basically, prenatal investigation&#xD;
      (for both mothers and fathers) will be carried out at the outpatient prenatal visit.&#xD;
      Postnatal investigation (for the mothers, fathers and infants) will be processed at the&#xD;
      pediatric outpatient visit when the infants are schedule for an immunization injection. After&#xD;
      data are collected, descriptive, analytic and longitudinal data analyses will be performed to&#xD;
      investigate the association between parental psychopathology and pregnancy outcomes and&#xD;
      newborn development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will explore the effects of the developmental trajectories of parental&#xD;
      psychopathology on newborn growth during the critical stage of pregnancy. It is hoped that&#xD;
      evidence based data could be obtained, examined, and applied in future&#xD;
      prevention-intervention program to promote parental and newborn health, both physically and&#xD;
      psychologically.&#xD;
