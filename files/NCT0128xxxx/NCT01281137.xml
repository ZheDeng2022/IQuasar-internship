      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood in the laboratory from patients receiving treatment for&#xD;
      cancer may help doctors learn more about changes that may occur in DNA and identify&#xD;
      biomarkers related to cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying changes in estrogen levels and grip strength in&#xD;
      postmenopausal women who have received 4 to 6 years of hormone therapy for breast cancer and&#xD;
      are currently receiving letrozole on clinical trial IBCSG-35-07.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the serum level of estrogens (Estradiol [E2], Estrone [E1], and Estrone&#xD;
           Sulphate [E1S] and sex hormone binding globulin [SHBG]) in postmenopausal women with&#xD;
           prior endocrine-responsive, node-positive, resectable breast cancer completing 4 to 6&#xD;
           years of adjuvant endocrine therapy and enrolled on clinical trial IBCSG-35-07 receiving&#xD;
           letrozole.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the degree of recovery of E2, E1, and E1S during the 3-month letrozole-off&#xD;
           gap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the association between estrogen level changes and the clinical outcomes of&#xD;
           toxicity and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effect of prior adjuvant endocrine therapy, age, body mass index, and&#xD;
           type of menopause on estrogen levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the variability of estrogen level changes and its association with germline&#xD;
           single nucleotide polymorphisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine changes in grip-strength score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients undergo blood sample collection at baseline for the analysis of single&#xD;
      nucleotide polymorphisms, after randomization on clinical trial IBCSG-35-07 and prior to the&#xD;
      beginning treatment on IBCSG-35-07. Patients also undergo serum collection at baseline and at&#xD;
      9, 10.5, and 12 months for the analysis of estrogen levels and sex hormone binding globulins.&#xD;
      Patients undergo measurement of grip strength at baseline and at 9 and 12 months. Samples may&#xD;
      be banked for future research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete quality-of-life questionnaires (Breast Cancer Prevention Trial [BCPT]&#xD;
      Symptom Scales on Form 35-PRS and IBCSG Trial 35-07 QL Form) periodically.&#xD;

    <description>In SOLE-EST, levels of E1, E2, and E1S were summarized over time at 0 (baseline), 9, 10.5, and 12 months from randomization among patients in the longitudinal analysis population (N=90 with post-baseline sample).</description>

    <description>Toxicity grade changes from 6 to 12 months (hot flashes, insomnia and arthralgia; Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3 values 1- 4 grouped as no change, increase in grade [worsening] or decrease in grade [improvement])</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life (QoL) Score Changes</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 months: Change is calculated from 12 months minus 6 months, therefore positive values indicate an improved condition and negative values indicate a declined condition</time_frame>
    <description>All patients in SOLE-EST were assessed for symptom specific QoL. QoL changes from 6 to 12 months (sleep change, hot flushes, tiredness, difficulties of becoming aroused, loss of sexual interest, physical wellbeing and mood; LASA (linear analogue self-assessment) scores 0-100 (higher is better QoL) were calculated as 12 months minus 6 months, so that negative is worsening and positive is improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Grip-strength Score in the Dominant Hand</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes in grip strength score is calculated at 12 months minus 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Grip strength was measured using the Martin Vigorimeter (a modified sphygmomanometer which measures the force of compression in kilo pascal by means of a compressible rubber ball). To perform the hand grip test, the patients were asked to squeeze the ball of a modified sphygmomanometer three times with maximal force and the maximal value of three trials of each hand were used for evaluation. Higher value represents greater strength, thus changes are calculated as 12 months minus 9 months so that positive is improved condition and negative is declined condition.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The phase 3 randomized, open-label Study of Letrozole Extension (SOLE) enrolled 4884 postmenopausal women between December 2007 and October 2012. Among them, 104 patients were enrolled in the SOLE Estrogen Substudy (SOLE-EST). SOLE was a multinational study performed in 240 centers of the Breast International Group-affiliated cooperative groups in 22 countries.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>There were 104 patients enrolled during the active period (25 continuous letrozole, 79 intermittent letrozole). Blood samples were obtained from 103 patients at baseline. For the longitudinal analysis, patients (N=90) were included if they had at least one post-baseline sample. At 9, 10.5, and 12 months, 85 (21 continuous, 64 intermittent), 84 (20 continuous, 64 intermittent) and 81 (19 continuous, 62 intermittent), patients, respectively, could be included in longitudinal analyses.</pre_assignment_details>

    <baseline>
      <population>Postmenopausal woman with hormone receptor-positive, lymph node-positive, and operable breast cancer of any age were included in the study. They must have undergone local treatment and have completed 4-6 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy. At enrollment, they had to be clinically free of breast cancer without any evidence of recurrence. Patients were randomized 1:1 for SOLE and enrolled in 1:3 ratio for SOLE-EST.</population>

QoL changes from 6 to 12 months (sleep change, hot flushes, tiredness, difficulties of becoming aroused, loss of sexual interest, physical wellbeing and mood; LASA (linear analogue self-assessment) scores 0-100 (higher is better QoL) were calculated as 12 months minus 6 months, so that negative is worsening and positive is improvement.</description>
        <time_frame>6 and 12 months: Change is calculated from 12 months minus 6 months, therefore positive values indicate an improved condition and negative values indicate a declined condition</time_frame>

        <title>Change in Grip-strength Score in the Dominant Hand</title>
        <description>Grip strength was measured using the Martin Vigorimeter (a modified sphygmomanometer which measures the force of compression in kilo pascal by means of a compressible rubber ball). To perform the hand grip test, the patients were asked to squeeze the ball of a modified sphygmomanometer three times with maximal force and the maximal value of three trials of each hand were used for evaluation. Higher value represents greater strength, thus changes are calculated as 12 months minus 9 months so that positive is improved condition and negative is declined condition.</description>
