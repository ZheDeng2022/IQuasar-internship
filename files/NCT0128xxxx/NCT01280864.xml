      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The bidirectional signaling between the cortex, and the pelvic floor/gut is deranged in&#xD;
           patients with IC and in IBS. Consequently, they will demonstrate hyperexcitability of&#xD;
           the pelvic floor/brain axis as evidenced by shorter latencies and increased amplitudes&#xD;
           for both the afferent anorectal-cortical evoked potentials and efferent&#xD;
           cortically-induced (magnetic) anorectal motor evoked potentials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Unlike patients with IC alone, patients with IBS will also demonstrate anorectal&#xD;
           visceral hypersensitivity and anorectal sensory-motor dysfunction.&#xD;

        Subjects: Sixty six consecutive adult, out-patients, over 18 years with IC alone and 66&#xD;
        adult patients with IBS alone and 30 healthy controls will be recruited for this 5 year&#xD;
        study and to fulfill all 4 aims of this study. All study aims will recruit under a unified&#xD;
        strategy. For most of the funding cycle, we will recruit simultaneously for several study&#xD;
        aims. To prevent confusion about concordant studies, similar standardized forms and&#xD;
        diagnostic tests will be used for each aim, with supplemental tools as needed.&#xD;

        Interstitial Cystitis/Painful Bladder Syndrome (IC/PBS) Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        IC/PBS patients who have met all three of the modified NIDDK criteria (84) for IC/PBS as&#xD;
        described below on a urinary symptom assessment form (Appendix 3):&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants will report the occurrence of bladder pain with a score of &gt;3 on a Likert&#xD;
             scale of 1-10.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participants will report the presence of increased urinary frequency with a score of&#xD;
             &gt;3 on a Likert scale of 1 -10.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The bladder pain and increased urinary frequency will have been present for at least 6&#xD;
             weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        We recognize that the NIDDK is currently working on recommending new diagnostic criteria&#xD;
        for interstitial cystitis. We will adopt any revised criteria commiserate with the new&#xD;
        recommendations of the NIDDK as our study progresses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of genitourinary tuberculosis, bladder cancer, high grade dysplasia, carcinoma&#xD;
             in situ, urethra, vaginal, or cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Previous treatment with cytoxan or cyclophosphamide (as reported by the patient).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Radiation cystitis (as reported by the patient).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Neurogenic bladder dysfunction (e.g.,) due to spinal cord injury, stroke, Parkinson's,&#xD;
             MS, spina bifida, or diabetic cystopathy (reported by the patient or determined during&#xD;
             a neurologic exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Having had an augmentation cystoplasty (as reported by the patient).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Having undergone a cystectomy, cystolysis, or neuroectomy as reported by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Having a urethral stricture of less than 12 French (as reported by the patient).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Urinalysis with &gt;10 white blood cells per high-powered field.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. A positive urine culture for bacterial cystitis within the past three months (by&#xD;
             report) or a positive dipstick for leucocyte esterase or nitrates on urinary dipstick&#xD;
             test at the time of presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Symptoms of vaginitis (as reported by the patient).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Active herpes at presentation or has had active herpes in the last three months (by&#xD;
             report).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Use of antimicrobials in the past three months for urinary tract infections (by&#xD;
             report).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Presence of bladder, ureteral, or urethral calculi (as reported by the patient).&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Having undergone a cystometrogram, bladder cystoscopy under anesthesia or bladder&#xD;
             biopsy under anesthesia or urethral dilation within the 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional Criteria for recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be assessed no sooner than 6 weeks following a DMSO or other treatment or a&#xD;
        hydrodistention as these treatments may influence inflammation. Subjects should have had no&#xD;
        infectious illness within 2 weeks of participation. As estrogen levels are thought to&#xD;
        contribute to IC symptoms, and symptom exacerbation has been reported perimenstrually (85),&#xD;
        all menstruating subjects will be tested during the mid-luteal portions of their menstrual&#xD;
        cycle (approx. days 7-14) to control for hormonal variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        We weighed the issue of excluding IC patients taking pain and psychotropic medication vs.&#xD;
        including these patients. Amitriptyline is commonly used for treatment of pain in both IC&#xD;
        and IBS; these patients commonly take other psychotropic drugs, systemic antihistamines,&#xD;
        and drugs for pain. If we were to exclude all patients on any medication, we would be able&#xD;
        to recruit a small and unrepresentative sample of the healthiest IC patients. If we asked&#xD;
        patients to refrain from using medication for 2 weeks before the study, we would be&#xD;
        subjecting them to undue pain and hardship, and might trigger an exacerbation of the&#xD;
        disease. However, use of antihistamines affect measurements of methylhistamine, and use of&#xD;
        amitriptyline and other anti- depressants produce a general blunting of the HPA response to&#xD;
        a stressful stimuli (86, 87) as well as modulate the neurobiologic responses. We will&#xD;
        exclude all subjects on antidepressants to examine a more homogeneous population. To try to&#xD;
        obtain as representative a sample as possible without confounding of results we used the&#xD;
        following strategy in our pilot studies and plan to use the same strategy in the proposed&#xD;
        study. Subjects taking systemic antihistamines could not be included if they had taken&#xD;
        antihistamines within a week of the study. Our preliminary data indicated that there was no&#xD;
        significant difference in the ACTH or cortisol response to the reactivity challenge among&#xD;
        patients using vs. those not using amitriptyline or other psychotropic medications (p's =&#xD;
        .45 to .90).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy Controls study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additionally, we will recruit 30 healthy controls matched for our patient group with&#xD;
        regards to age, gender, hormonal status and parity. Controls will be healthy women with no&#xD;
        history of urological disease or genito-urinary symptoms and no immunomodulatory disease&#xD;
        such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, MS, chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, diabetes, cancer,&#xD;
        HIV, vestibulitis, allergies, chronic fungal infections, migraines, depression, or chronic&#xD;
        pain conditions. Healthy controls will be asked to complete the Mayo Health Screening&#xD;
        survey and this will be used to adjudicate their health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy controls will be on NO meds other than multivitamins, oral contraceptives, and&#xD;
        possibly low dose aspirin. They can not be taking anti-hypertensives, serotonin reuptake&#xD;
        inhibitors, thyroid meds or other medications.&#xD;
