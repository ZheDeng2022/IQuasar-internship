      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The blood-brain barrier helps to protect the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord)&#xD;
      from harmful toxins, but also prevents potentially useful chemotherapy from reaching brain&#xD;
      tumors. The barrier is formed by tight connections between blood vessel cells and molecules&#xD;
      found on the surface of brain blood vessels such as Permeability-glycoprotein (Pgp). Pgp may&#xD;
      influence whether patients with brain tumors known as gliomas respond to chemotherapy and&#xD;
      what side effects they may experience. The compound (11C)N-desmethyl-loperamide ((11C)dLop)&#xD;
      reacts to Pgp molecules, and therefore may be used with positron emission tomography (PET)&#xD;
      imaging to study the blood brain barrier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study the ability of PET imaging with (11C)dLop to evaluate the blood brain barrier in&#xD;
      brain tumor patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have a brain tumor with characteristics that may&#xD;
      be imaged with techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) andPET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a full physical examination and medical history,&#xD;
           blood and urine tests, and tumor imaging studies (fluorodeoxyglucose PET and MRI scans&#xD;
           with contrast agent).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The (11C)dLop scan will take 1 hour to perform. Participants will be asked to return for&#xD;
           blood and urine tests approximately 24 hours after the PET scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have followup visits at least every 4 months by repeating a complete&#xD;
           history and physical exam and brain MRI. Participants may have repeat scans with&#xD;
           (11C)dLop at various points in the course of cancer treatment, but will not have these&#xD;
           scans more than twice in a 12-month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be followed for as long as possible during treatment to see if imaging&#xD;
           with (11C)dLop correlates with response to the treatments.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A potential impedance to successful glioma chemotherapy is sanctuary for tumor behind the&#xD;
      blood brain barrier. P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is an efflux transporter encoded by MDR1 that&#xD;
      contributes to the functional regulation of substrates across the cerebrovasular endothelium.&#xD;
      Pgp activity in patients with gliomas may influence response to therapy and neurotoxicity.&#xD;
      (11C) N-desmethyl-loperamide (11C)dLop) is a radioligand substrate for Pgp, and PET imaging&#xD;
      with this molecular marker may provide a non-invasive, in vivo method of examining Pgp&#xD;
      function in brain tumor patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To measure the uptake of (11C)N-desmethyl-loperamide ((11C)dLop) using PET imaging as a&#xD;
      marker of Pglycoprotein function in patients with intracranial gliomas&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate (11C)dLop PET uptake with perfusion MRI parameters and FDG PET uptake for&#xD;
           volumes of interest (VOI) determined by the baseline MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop exploratory data for the correlation of (11C)dLop PET imaging with patient&#xD;
           outcomes such as response to therapy, survival, and neurotoxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop exploratory data for the correlation of (11C)dLop PET imaging with&#xD;
           immunohistochemical and molecular genomic assays of MDR1 and Pgp&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with predominantly non-enhancing intracranial gliomas will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study of (11C)dLop PET imaging in 10 patients with intracranial glioma.&#xD;
      Standard uptake values (SUVs) corrected for cerebral blood flow determined by (15O)H20 PET&#xD;
      scans will be correlated to DCE-MRI (obtained within prior 2 weeks) and FDG-PET (obtained&#xD;
      within prior 4 weeks) to characterize locoregional differences in Pgp function. When&#xD;
      available, correlative studies performed on archived tumor tissue acquired immediately&#xD;
      subsequent to (11C)dLop scanning will include immunohistochemical assays of Pgp expression,&#xD;
      as well as characterization of MDR1 polymorphisms. Patient case histories will be followed&#xD;
      longitudinally to make observations about how (11C)dLop imaging may correlate with patient&#xD;
      outcomes such as response to therapy, survival, and neurotoxicity.&#xD;
