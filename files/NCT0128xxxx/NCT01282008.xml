      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This document outlines the study design and procedures to be used to evaluate a series of&#xD;
      corrective statements to augment consumer knowledge and beliefs about smoking as related to&#xD;
      past actions of tobacco companies. The statements were ordered by a U.S. Federal Court in&#xD;
      U.S. v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., and are intended to target potential misperceptions&#xD;
      resultant of past marketing and promotion practices undertaken by the tobacco industry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Department of Justice has asked NCI to take the lead on developing and testing&#xD;
      corrective statements with adult and youth audiences to ensure both message comprehension and&#xD;
      avoidance of unintended consequences of message exposure, such as boomerang effects, smoking&#xD;
      triggers, or knowledge gaps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The court has identified five areas that the statements shall address:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The adverse health effects of smoking;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The addictiveness of smoking and nicotine;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The lack of any significant health benefit from smoking low tar, light, ultra light,&#xD;
           mild, and natural cigarettes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The tobacco industry s manipulation of cigarette design and composition to ensure&#xD;
           optimum nicotine delivery;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The adverse health effects of secondhand smoke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Message testing will be undertaken with the following audiences:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current smokers (with an oversample of low socioeconomic status individuals)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General population nonsmokers and former smokers (with an oversample of low&#xD;
           socioeconomic status individuals)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spanish-speaking Hispanics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Youth age 14-17&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both qualitative and quantitative methods (focus groups and post-test comparison group&#xD;
      Web-enabled surveys) will be used to develop and test a range of corrective statements in the&#xD;
      five areas outlined by the court.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Focus group participants: 48-64&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survey participants: 2500&#xD;
