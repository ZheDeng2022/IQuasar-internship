      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and pegylated liposomal&#xD;
      doxorubicin hydrochloride (PLD) work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,&#xD;
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Everolimus may stop the growth&#xD;
      of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving carboplatin and&#xD;
      PLD together with everolimus may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of everolimus when&#xD;
      given together with carboplatin and PLD in treating patients with relapsed ovarian&#xD;
      epithelial, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cavity cancer&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of RAD001 (everolimus) in combination with&#xD;
      carboplatin and PLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine safety/tolerability of the three drug combination of carboplatin, PLD and RAD001&#xD;
      (everolimus).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine preliminary analysis of anti-tumor activity of this regimen in patients with&#xD;
      recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of everolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive carboplatin intravenously (IV) and PLD IV on day 1 and everolimus orally&#xD;
      (PO) once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 1 year.&#xD;
