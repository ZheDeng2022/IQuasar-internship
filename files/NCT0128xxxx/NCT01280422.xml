    <textblock>
      The doctor's overridden rate for Drug-drug interaction (DDI) alert systems was 85-95% in&#xD;
      foreign and there was more than 90% overridden rate in Taiwan. Why DDI alerts systems which&#xD;
      spent much time and money to establish could not use medicinal information to increase drug&#xD;
      safety? One of the reasons which induced to override was that health care thought there were&#xD;
      too much DDI alerts and high false alerts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The difference between DDI alert systems from pharmacists to confirm drug-drug interaction&#xD;
      was that pharmacists not only confirmed ordering drug at the same time but also checked the&#xD;
      other drug information such as frequency, rote and refill etc. Therefore, DDI alert systems&#xD;
      which were established by drug code alone would induce a lot of false alerts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to study how much false alert rate in drug-drug interactions, this research selected&#xD;
      most common drug-drug interaction which was antacids and antibiotics. Antacids were most&#xD;
      self-payment so this research needed to analyze ROCDR (Establishing a Multi-Center,&#xD;
      Longitudinal, Research-Oriented Clinical Data Repository for Clinical Research). The aim was&#xD;
      to study how many drug-drug interactions and false alerts from antacids and antibiotics and&#xD;
      analyze the difference in different department. Finally, proposing advice and assessment for&#xD;
      building drug-drug interaction alerts system to strength drug information system and increase&#xD;
      drug safety.&#xD;
