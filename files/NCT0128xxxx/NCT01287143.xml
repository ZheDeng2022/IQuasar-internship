      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Fever is a common symptom of illness, but it can involve many signs (a signal that&#xD;
      something is not right in the body that can be seen by others, such as vomiting) and symptoms&#xD;
      (a signal that something is not right in the body that are felt only by the person, such as&#xD;
      pain) that may differ depending on the type of illness involved. Researchers are interested&#xD;
      in studying individuals who have a fever to examine how often these signs and symptoms are&#xD;
      experienced by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To identify and evaluate the signs and symptoms of fever and examine their frequency in&#xD;
      individuals who have fever.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 8 years of age who are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center and have a&#xD;
      fever (body temperature of at least 38 degrees Celsius/100.4 degrees Fahrenheit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened upon admission to the NIH Clinical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will review the Clinical Center admission records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will complete a 15- to 20-minute survey with questions about how they are&#xD;
           feeling and what symptoms they have experienced before, during and after an episode of&#xD;
           fever.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fever is one of the most prevalent signs in hospitalized patients, signaling the activation&#xD;
      of the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is little empiric evidence related to symptoms or signs that accompany changes in body&#xD;
      temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding the nature, timing and relationship of patient signs and symptoms of fever will&#xD;
      provide insight into the febrile process and guide more informed treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol is divided into two phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To develop and implement a simple clinical tool for assessing and documenting&#xD;
      patient-reported signs and symptoms of fever.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To describe the prevalence and relationship of signs and symptoms that accompanies a febrile&#xD;
      state and related patterns of change over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adult and pediatric medical-surgical patients hospitalized at the Clinical Center&#xD;
           admitted to 3NE (oncology/ transplant), 3NW (surgical oncology) and 1NW (pediatric).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 8 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Understand and speak English&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inpatients admitted to the Clinical Research Center&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 8 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Descriptive study involving qualitative interviews and chart reviews from medical surgical&#xD;
      inpatients. Two types of interviews with two different sets of patients will be conducted.&#xD;
      The maximum number of research participants for this phase will be 65. The final sample size&#xD;
      will be determined based on the point of saturation, defined as four consecutive interviews&#xD;
      during which no new signs or symptoms associated with fever are identified. The second set of&#xD;
      interviews will involve 20 to 30 new research participants, including at least 5 patients&#xD;
      less than 18 years of age who will review a list of signs and symptoms of fever for&#xD;
      comprehension and clarity to inform the final list and determine the terminology to be used&#xD;
      in the FAST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study of the Febrile Assessment Tool (FAST)&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Test of the FAST in 120 patients. Before placing the FAST in the electronic record (Clinical&#xD;
      Research Information System-CRIS) this new assessment tool will be used in approximately 120&#xD;
      patients during routine vital sign measurements. Patients admitted to the surgical oncology&#xD;
      unit (3NW) will be consented and followed with collection of the FAST assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Education Implementation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inform nursing staff of the background, content and procedures for using the Febrile&#xD;
           Assessment Tool (FAST)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Educational interim will last 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Approximately 2 months or at the discretion of the PI after FAST education&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Descriptive study involving chart review from unidentified inpatients. The sample size&#xD;
           will be a maximum of 500.&#xD;
