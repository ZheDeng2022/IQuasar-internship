  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether anakinra is able to reduce insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be tested in overweighted type I diabetes mellitus patients, which have no residual&#xD;
      beta-cell function. By using this patient group, all positive effects on glycemic control&#xD;
      should be the consequence of improved insulin sensitivity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although typically associated with type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance has been documented in&#xD;
      Type 1 diabetes. Insulin resistance may also play an important role in the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes mellitus. Once diabetes has emerged chronically elevated glucose levels&#xD;
      further induce insulin resistance (glucose toxicity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammation is an important link between obesity and insulin resistance. The mechanism of&#xD;
      hyperglycemia-induced insulin resistance is not clear, but evidently must be related to high&#xD;
      glucose levels. There are indications that chronic hyperglycemia can induce inflammation, for&#xD;
      example hyperglycemia induces IL-1β release, and recent studies have shown an interaction&#xD;
      with thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP), at the level of the beta-cell but also, as&#xD;
      found by our own group, at the level of the adipose tissue&#xD;
&#xD;
      All together, these findings suggest that blocking IL-1β-receptor activation by the&#xD;
      interleukin-1 receptor antagonist anakinra, may reverse insulin resistance associated both&#xD;
      with obesity and/or chronic hyperglycemia. When applied in (hyperglycemic) subjects with type&#xD;
      2 diabetes, blocking IL-1β should diminish the effects of glucose toxicity both at the level&#xD;
      of beta-cell function as at the level of insulin sensitivity. When applied in (hyperglycemic)&#xD;
      subjects with type 1 diabetes, the effects of glucose toxicity at the level of insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity should decrease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to be able to study an isolated effect of IL-1β blockade on insulin sensitivity,&#xD;
      this study will test this hypothesis in subjects with type 1 diabetes and hence provide a&#xD;
      proof of principle in vivo in humans for a proposed link between hyperglycemia, inflammation&#xD;
      and insulin resistance.&#xD;
