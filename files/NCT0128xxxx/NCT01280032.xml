  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vertebral column is the most prevalent location of bone metastases. Besides axial pain,&#xD;
      vertebral metastases cause pathological fracture and neurological dysfunction by spinal cord&#xD;
      compression. Although the median overall survival of patients with bone metastases is only&#xD;
      7-9 month, half of them live longer and will require palliative treatment for their symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment options are radiotherapy and /or surgical treatment such as laminectomy,&#xD;
      vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty. Various studies have shown the superiority of postoperative&#xD;
      external beam radiotherapy after kyphoplasty in spinal metastases compared to surgery or&#xD;
      radiotherapy alone. Nevertheless postoperative radiation schedules last 2-4 weeks. Moreover&#xD;
      many patients present visceral and bone metastases simultaneously and require urgent systemic&#xD;
      therapy. However, due to potentiated toxicity, concurrent therapy with full dose chemotherapy&#xD;
      and radiotherapy is rarely possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have therefore established a novel method for intraoperative radiotherapy&#xD;
      (IORT) during kyphoplasty which enables immediate stability, sterilization of the metastasis&#xD;
      and immediate initiation of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The kyphoplasty itself is performed according to the standard procedure with some minor&#xD;
      modifications. In short under general anaesthesia, a bipedicular approach into the affected&#xD;
      vertebra is chosen with insertion of specially designed metallic sleeves to guide the&#xD;
      electron drift tube of the miniature X-ray generator (INTRABEAM®). To perform the IORT during&#xD;
      a kyphoplasty with this device a new applicator was designed. This sterile applicator&#xD;
      consists of a plastic head, which is needed to attach it to the X-ray source and a stainless&#xD;
      steel tube. This tube protects the probe from bending. Under fluoroscopic guidance the&#xD;
      applicator including the drift tube is guided through the metallic sleeves in the vertebral&#xD;
      body. A dose of 8 Gy in 5 mm distance is delivered. After IORT the INTRABEAM system is&#xD;
      removed. The kyphoplasty balloon is inflated and PMMA-cement is injected. Afterwards the&#xD;
      sleeves are removed and the wound is closed as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of this study is the definition of the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) for IORT during a&#xD;
      kyphoplasty using specific MTD-criteria and evaluating the effectiveness of this combined&#xD;
      treatment procedure. To determine the MTD 3 levels with increasing doses are planned:&#xD;
&#xD;
      8 Gy in 5 mm distance, 8 Gy in 8 mm distance and 8 Gy in 10 mm distance.&#xD;
