      Objective: To evaluate pediatric emergency department provider lumbar puncture success with&#xD;
      and without the Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced, a new pressure transducer, in order to&#xD;
      determine: the proportion of lumbar punctures where a) any cerebrospinal fluid is obtained on&#xD;
      the first attempt, b) any cerebrospinal fluid is obtained on any attempt, and c) sufficient&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid is obtained for standard tests (culture, chemistries, cell count); the&#xD;
      time to provider success in obtaining a) a drop of fluid from the needle, and b) opening&#xD;
      pressure measurement; the proportion of successful lumbar punctures that contain blood; and&#xD;
      provider satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Lumbar punctures are necessary to diagnose meningitis, neurological diseases and&#xD;
      some cancers. They are common pediatric emergency department procedures that frequently&#xD;
      require repeated attempts or are only partially successful, with sufficient blood to limit&#xD;
      interpretation. Measuring cerebrospinal fluid pressure during lumbar punctures is recommended&#xD;
      but rarely done, due to limitations of current technology. Liquid column manometry is&#xD;
      cumbersome, time-consuming and frequently impractical. Existing pressure transduction probes&#xD;
      that connect via tubing to external monitors are not designed or recommended for lumbar&#xD;
      punctures. The pressure is displayed on a monitor that is difficult to view during the LP&#xD;
      procedure and they equilibrate too slowly to keep pace of pressure changes during LPs. The&#xD;
      Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced is a new, inexpensive, disposable, medical device,&#xD;
      specifically designed for use during LPs, that has the potential to increase lumbar punctures&#xD;
      success and decrease blood contamination. It attaches to the spinal needle and displays both&#xD;
      a numeric pressure value and a pressure waveform, allowing physicians to more readily&#xD;
      identify the cerebrospinal fluid space and measure cerebrospinal fluid pressure. The device&#xD;
      is small, easy to use, and readily incorporated into standard practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced uniquely provides immediate feedback about pressure that&#xD;
      may allow physicians to more quickly and confidently identify the CSF space, and instantly&#xD;
      determine cerebrospinal fluid pressure when the space is reached. The investigators believe&#xD;
      the Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced will increase lumbar punctures success and decrease the&#xD;
      proportion containing blood. It has the potential to become the standard of care and be used&#xD;
      in every lumbar puncture procedure. This study is expected to demonstrate the clinical&#xD;
      utility of the Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced to the medical community. Increased awareness&#xD;
      of the Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced and a positive demonstration of the viability of the&#xD;
      technology will help attract either the investment capital or the strategic partnership&#xD;
      necessary to fully develop the market.&#xD;

      Objective: To evaluate pediatric emergency department (ED) provider lumbar puncture success&#xD;
      with and without the Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced, a new pressure transducer, in order to&#xD;
      determine: the proportion of lumbar punctures (LPs) where a) any cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is&#xD;
      obtained on the first attempt, b) any CSF is obtained on any attempt, and c) sufficient CSF&#xD;
      is obtained for standard tests (culture, chemistries, cell count); the time to provider&#xD;
      success in obtaining a) a drop of fluid from the needle, and b) opening pressure measurement;&#xD;
      the proportion of successful lumbar punctures that contain blood; and provider satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Lumbar punctures are necessary to diagnose meningitis, neurological diseases and&#xD;
      some cancers. They are common pediatric emergency department procedures that frequently&#xD;
      require repeated attempts or are only partially successful, with sufficient blood to limit&#xD;
      interpretation. Measuring cerebrospinal fluid pressure during a lumbar puncture is&#xD;
      recommended but rarely done, due to limitations of current technology. Liquid column&#xD;
      manometry is cumbersome, time-consuming and frequently impractical. Existing pressure&#xD;
      transduction probes that connect via tubing to external monitors are not designed or&#xD;
      recommended for LPs. The pressure is displayed on a monitor that is difficult to view during&#xD;
      the lumbar puncture procedure and they equilibrate too slowly to keep pace of pressure&#xD;
      changes during lumbar puncture. The Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced is a new, inexpensive,&#xD;
      disposable, medical device, specifically designed for use during lumbar punctures, that has&#xD;
      the potential to increase lumbar puncture success and decrease blood contamination. It&#xD;
      attaches to the spinal needle and displays both a numeric pressure value and a pressure&#xD;
      waveform, allowing physicians to more readily identify the cerebrospinal fluid space and&#xD;
      measure cerebrospinal fluid pressure. The device is small, easy to use, and readily&#xD;
      incorporated into standard practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This randomized clinical trial will test adding the Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced&#xD;
      vs. standard care in 60 children 0-16 years old who are receiving a lumbar puncture in the&#xD;
      Seattle Children's Hospital Emergency Department. We will test the Compass Lumbar Puncture&#xD;
      Enhanced against standard care in 60 children receiving lumbar puncture, comparing success,&#xD;
      pressures obtaining, time to success, complications (e.g. &gt;200 red blood cells/mm3) and&#xD;
      provider satisfaction. Results will be compared with chi-squared tests, regressions,&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier and logrank tests. We expect improved success, decreased time to success and&#xD;
      complications and high provider satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact: Currently, one third of lumbar punctures require multiple attempts, 7-20% contain&#xD;
      blood that limits interpretation, and 6% are unsuccessful. This results in unnecessary&#xD;
      hospitalizations, increased hospital days, increased antibiotic use and increased numbers of&#xD;
      repeat procedures. The Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced uniquely provides immediate feedback&#xD;
      about pressure that will allow physicians to more quickly and confidently identify the&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid space, and instantly determine cerebrospinal fluid pressure when the&#xD;
      space is reached. We believe the Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced will increase lumbar&#xD;
      puncture success and decrease the proportion containing blood. It has the potential to become&#xD;
      the standard of care and be used in every lumbar puncture procedure. This study is expected&#xD;
      to demonstrate the clinical utility of the Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced to the medical&#xD;
      community.&#xD;
