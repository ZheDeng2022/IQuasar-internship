  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I clinical trial studies the side effects and best dose of veliparib when given&#xD;
      together with paclitaxel and cisplatin and to see how well they work in treating patients&#xD;
      with cervical cancer that has spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured&#xD;
      or controlled with treatment or that has come back. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      paclitaxel and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by&#xD;
      killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.&#xD;
      Veliparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell&#xD;
      growth. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) and giving chemotherapy together&#xD;
      with veliparib may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities of ABT-888&#xD;
      (veliparib) when combined with cisplatin and paclitaxel in women with advanced, persistent,&#xD;
      or recurrent cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To examine the safety of administering ABT-888 when combined with cisplatin and&#xD;
      paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Once the recommended phase II dose is established, to estimate the efficacy of&#xD;
      cisplatin, paclitaxel, and ABT-888 with respect to objective tumor response in patients with&#xD;
      advanced, persistent, or recurrent carcinoma of the cervix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To examine the effects of this regimen on progression-free survival and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the proportion of patients with advanced, persistent, or recurrent cancer of&#xD;
      the cervix whose tumors demonstrate loss of the Fanconi anemia group D2 (FancD2) foci&#xD;
      formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the association between loss of FancD2 foci formation and progression-free&#xD;
      survival, overall survival, and response in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of veliparib followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours on day 1, cisplatin IV over 1&#xD;
      hour on day 2, and veliparib orally (PO) on days 1-7. Courses repeat every 21 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and&#xD;
      then every 6 months for 3 years.&#xD;
