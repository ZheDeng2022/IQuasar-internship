      Study description and purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short description: Observational multicentre study in ICU patients. Study purpose:&#xD;
      Epidemiological determinants of candidemia, management and outcome evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How the study would help? It would help to evaluate outcomes of current management strategies&#xD;
      and to develop future better management strategies of candidemia cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Critical issues &amp; risk: Site &amp; center selection would be important No risk for patients&#xD;
      included in the study as it is only observational study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Site selection: A questionnaire will be circulated (annexure I) to all major tertiary care&#xD;
      centers of India. The centers will be selected on the competence of candidemia diagnosis and&#xD;
      availability ICU facilities. Expected number of centers ~ 20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study period: October 1, 2010 - March 31, 2012 No of patients/sites: Consecutive all patients&#xD;
      with candidemia detected during ICU stay over the study period will be included in the study&#xD;
      in each site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient selection: Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Admitted in ICU for &gt; 48 hours (to coincide definitions of nosocomial or ICU-acquired)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. All age group patients will be included (pediatric &amp; adult)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Diagnosed as proven candidemia (isolation of Candida species from blood culture on ≥ 1&#xD;
           occasion during ICU stay)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Blood culture positive for Candida spp. , if sample has been drawn within 48 hrs after&#xD;
           discharge from the ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Patient already diagnosed of candidemia before admission in ICU Variables|: types of ICU,&#xD;
      demographic data of patients, underlying illness, risk factors, severity scores, diagnostic&#xD;
      methods, treatment characteristics (Annexure II) and treatment outcomes (Annexure III)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of candidemia: Isolation of Candida species from blood culture (arterial/venous) by&#xD;
      any method (conventional/ lysis-centrifugation/ automated system/ any other method). No&#xD;
      intervention in diagnostic processes at any center. Centers not performing diagnosis of&#xD;
      candidemia will be excluded from the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data recording: both manual and online. The form of Annexure II will be filled up within 5&#xD;
      days of diagnosis of candidemia; Annexure III will be filled up within 7 days of discharge&#xD;
      from hospital or 30 days after starting the antifungal therapy or death of the patient (which&#xD;
      over period is early).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: appropriate statistical method will be employed for analysis of data.&#xD;

&#xD;
             1. Determine the prevalence of candidemia among ICU patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Determine the prevalence of candidemia due to C. albicans and each species of&#xD;
                non-albicans Candida species.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Determine the demographics and risk factors for candidemia patients, and comparison&#xD;
                of relevant variables between the cases with C. albicans and non-albicans Candida&#xD;
                species isolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Describe the management of candidemia cases and outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Determine the in-vitro antifungal susceptibility testing of Candida isolates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study description and purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1 Observational multicentre study of ICUs in India. Institute having ICUs and facility&#xD;
           for diagnosis of candidemia will be chosen.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2 Purpose: Determination of epidemiological parameter of candidemia, description of&#xD;
           current management and outcome of patients with candidemia. This would help in&#xD;
           formulation of a guideline for management of patients with candidemia especially when&#xD;
           the patients are critically ill and admitted in ICUs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3 Critical issues &amp; risk: There is no risk for patient as it only observational study&#xD;
           and no intervention is intended. The site selection would be important to get useful&#xD;

&#xD;
           During the study period, all process of patient management including diagnosis and&#xD;
           treatment will be determined by treating physician. There will be no intervention in&#xD;
           patient management as a part of study related activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Conduct of the study 6.1 Investigators of the study - The ICU specialist in charge and&#xD;
           microbiologist/mycologist of each center will be the site investigators of the study.&#xD;
           Prof. Arunaloke Chakrabarti of PGIMER, Chandigarh will be coordinator of the study.&#xD;
           A/Prof. Sharon Chen, Medical Mycologist, Infectious Diseases and Microbiology, Westmead&#xD;
           Hospital, Australia will be the advisor of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2 Patient enrollment - The investigator should ensure that only the patients with&#xD;
      candidemia development in the ICU (see inclusion criteria) are included. Consecutively all&#xD;
      patients meeting the eligibility criteria will be consecutively enrolled. The patients will&#xD;
      be enrolled prospectively as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed. The patients will be&#xD;
      followed up till discharge from hospital or 30 days after start of antifungal therapy or&#xD;
      death (whichever is earlier).&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.3 Data collection - The form (Annexure II) will be filled up within 5 days of diagnosis of&#xD;
      candidemia. The investigator would make sure that the patient is not identified (No mention&#xD;
      of patient's name, address, hospital registration no. or any laboratory no. on the survey&#xD;
      forms). The data collection will be performed both on line and on hard copy. The following&#xD;
      variable will be noted:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demographic data&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluation of the severity of the patient (severity will be assessed on the basis of&#xD;
           scoring system available in the hospital (e.g, APACHE, SOFA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Underlying disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Risk factors&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. History of previous antifungal therapy (prophylaxis/empiric/ definitive treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Description of candidemia episode&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Laboratory results&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Diagnosis of candidemia. 6.4 Laboratory or mycological tests - No laboratory or&#xD;
           microbiological test is mandatory for the patient as a part of study. Study protocol&#xD;
           will not intervene anywhere in laboratory investigation of the patient. Data of the&#xD;
           laboratory tests performed as part of routine will be collected on study cases forms 6.5&#xD;
           Patient management: The study will not intervene anywhere in patient management. The&#xD;
           clinician in charge will manage the patient. The data of management practiced will be&#xD;
           incorporated retrospectively in management form (Annexure III) within 7 days of&#xD;
           patient's discharge from hospital or 30 days after start antifungal therapy or patient's&#xD;
           death (whichever is earlier) 6.6 Identification of Candida isolates and antifungal&#xD;
           susceptibility testing: Candida isolates may be identified and antifungal susceptibility&#xD;
           testing may be performed at the study centers as part of the center's routine procedure.&#xD;
           However, all Candida isolates (isolated from blood) will be submitted to the reference&#xD;
           laboratory at Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER),&#xD;
           Chandigarh after filling the form IV. PGIMER, Chandigarh will confirm the identity of&#xD;
           all Candida isolates and perform antifungal susceptibility testing according to CLSI&#xD;
           M27-A3 protocol (broth microdilution method) 6.7. Statistical analysis: Descriptive&#xD;
           statistical methods will be employed to analyze the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Security and Confidentiality Once the patient is deemed eligible to participate and&#xD;
      consent has been obtained (if any), a unique study number will be assigned. Subject initials&#xD;
      and institution identification will be entered into a log book that will remain sole property&#xD;
      of each site. The logbook will be kept secured at each site according to site's policies and&#xD;
      procedures. The logbook will assist the investigator at the particular Institute to track and&#xD;
      upload data in the system. Each site will be able to view its own patients entered and&#xD;
      summary data on the aggregate patients of all centers, but no data from other sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Publication : In the event of publication, the Investigators' names that will be cited&#xD;
      will be those who have attributed the largest number of cases of the study. The coordinator&#xD;
      and the advisor will also be cited. The order of the authorship would depend upon the number&#xD;
      of cases per investigator per center, in the decreasing order. The exact number of authors&#xD;
      remains to be decided upon, but the maximum number may be restricted to 11. The 'SIHAM'&#xD;
      candidemia network will be mentioned at the end of authors. All other investigators will be&#xD;
      acknowledged as participants of the network in the appendix. The sponsor of the network will&#xD;
      be acknowledged in each publication. None of the sites is permitted to make any publication&#xD;
      on its sites data, based solely on the parameters included in this study for the cases&#xD;
      included in the present study, during this study period. If there is any breach of this&#xD;
      understanding, the data from that centre will not be included in the final data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. Ethical Issue: The project should be cleared by the participating centers at their&#xD;
      respective local Ethics Committee before commencing the project. The Ethics approval&#xD;
      Certificate should be submitted to the coordinator before commencing the project.&#xD;
