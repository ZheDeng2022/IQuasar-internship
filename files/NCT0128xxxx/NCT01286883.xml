      The study will enroll patients with metastatic colorectal cancer receiving chemotherapy. A&#xD;
      total of approximately 22 cc of blood will be drawn during various chemotherapy infusions.&#xD;
      Additional proposed laboratory studies may unravel important biological insights into the&#xD;
      relationship of circulating tumor cell genomic and genetic profiles as they compare to the&#xD;
      primary tumors. Additionally the investigators hope to gain an understanding of potential&#xD;
      subgroups of patients that have very high numbers of circulating tumor cells or those with&#xD;
      early relapse of circulating tumor cells after early reduction of circulating tumor cell&#xD;
      numbers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) has a five year survival of &lt;10% and is the cause of&#xD;
      death of nearly 50,000 individuals in the United States each year. Current first and second&#xD;
      line therapies for mCRC include FOLFOX, XELOX, or FOLFIRI in combination with Bevacizumab or&#xD;
      Cetuximab or Panitumumab, as well as Xeloda, camptosar or infusional 5-FU within various less&#xD;
      intensive regimens for patients who cannot tolerate full-dose chemotherapy. Current practice&#xD;
      involves evaluation of response by imaging at 2-3 months after initiation of therapy. Recent&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated that the number of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the blood of&#xD;
      patients with mCRC has independent prognostic value in terms of reflecting disease burden as&#xD;
      well as indicating response to therapy. The use of CTC counts offers the possibility of&#xD;
      predicting response in treated patients at an earlier time than through standard means by&#xD;
      using CT scans. The investigators hypothesize that subsets of CTCs with cancer stem cell&#xD;
      (CSC) markers or other known prognostic markers may improve the prognostic value of CTC&#xD;
      evaluation in the course of therapy of patients with mCRC. The protocol will use Veridex&#xD;
      CellSearch technology and will when possible compare this to other emerging technologies&#xD;
      including microfluidic devices that can isolate CTCs or GFP-expressing adenoviruses that&#xD;
      replicate in telomerase-expressing epithelial tumor cells ex-vivo. The protocol will enroll&#xD;
      200 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer receiving therapy. Additional proposed&#xD;
      laboratory studies may unravel important biological insights into the relationship of CTC&#xD;
      genomic and genetic profiles as they compare to the primary tumors. Additionally the&#xD;
      investigators hope to gain an understanding of potential subgroups of patients that have very&#xD;
      high numbers of CTCs or those with early relapse of CTC after early reduction of CTC numbers.&#xD;
      The impact of this research may be in better prediction of response to mCRC therapy so that&#xD;
      patients can be treated with second line or other experimental therapy if they are unlikely&#xD;
      to respond to their current therapy as predicted by CTC evaluation.&#xD;
