      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a symmetric polyarticular arthritis that primarily affects the&#xD;
      small diarthrodial joints of the hands and feet. In addition to inflammation in the synovium,&#xD;
      which is the joint lining, the aggressive front of tissue called pannus invades and destroys&#xD;
      local articular structures. The synovium is normally a relatively acellular structure with a&#xD;
      delicate intimal lining. RA is also a chronic autoimmune disease and can lead to deformities&#xD;
      and severe disabilities, due to irreversible damage of tendons, joints, and bones. It is&#xD;
      known that RA can be considered as a complex genetic disease and many &quot;disease-risk&quot; genes or&#xD;
      &quot;disease-protective&quot; genes can be involved. Numerous studies reported the association of&#xD;
      IL-6, IL-8 genes with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and the association of HLA-DR gene&#xD;
      polymorphisms with RA. In addition, the chronic inflammatory process of RA is mediated&#xD;
      through cytokines network, which leads to induce some destructive enzymes, like matrix&#xD;
      metalloprotieases, in the cellular synovial tissue of joints. Although RA is a common&#xD;
      arthritis with a prevalence of 1% in Taiwan, the pathogenesis is still incompletely studied,&#xD;
      especially in DNA repair relative genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this proposal, we would like to perform the following experiments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study the associations of the polymorphisms of DNA repair relative genes and the&#xD;
           susceptibility to RA;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study the associations of the copy number variation (CNV) of DNA repair relative genes&#xD;
           and the susceptibility to RA;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Functional assay in DNA repair relative genes and compare it with the copy number&#xD;
           variation (CNV), genotype and/or haplotype in RA patients; So far, we have analyzed the&#xD;
           association between RA and several SNPs of MUTYH in DNA repair systems. We also analyzed&#xD;
           the relationship between the SNPs results and RA using the pathological features. These&#xD;
           data are helpful to clarify the susceptibility of RA patients with the genotype and/or&#xD;
           haplotype in DNA repair system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is valuable for the understanding the role of DNA repair system plays in the&#xD;
      progression of rheumatoid arthritis and for the development of new therapeutic modality in&#xD;
      the future.&#xD;
