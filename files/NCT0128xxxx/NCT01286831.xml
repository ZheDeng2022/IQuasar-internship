    <textblock>
      This will be a single-centre, open-label, single-dose study to characterise the metabolic&#xD;
      disposition of oral [14C]GW642444. Six healthy male subjects will be enrolled to ensure at&#xD;
      least four fully evaluable subjects. Each subject will receive a single 200μg oral dose of&#xD;
      GW642444 containing 2 μCi (0.074MBq) of [14C]GW642444. Whilst subjects are inhouse, blood,&#xD;
      urine and faecal samples will be collected for a minimum of 168 hours after dosing (7 days)&#xD;
      or for up to 240 hours (10 days) depending on amounts of radioactivity still being excreted&#xD;
      after Day 5. Faecal sample collection may continue at home for up to 14 days. Bile samples&#xD;
      will be collected using Entero-Test string sampling of duodenal bile. Plasma will be prepared&#xD;
      from blood at various sample times after dosing to measure parent drug and total&#xD;
      radiolabelled drug-related material. Urine and faeces aliquots will be taken to measure total&#xD;
      radiolabelled drug-related material. Samples of urine, faeces, plasma and bile will be&#xD;
      transferred into a separate study to characterise and, where feasible, quantify metabolites&#xD;
      in these matrices. Safety and tolerability will be assessed by blood pressure, heart rate,&#xD;
      12- lead electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical laboratory safety tests, and collection of adverse&#xD;
      events (AEs).&#xD;
