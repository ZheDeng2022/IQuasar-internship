  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the influence of a lung protective ventilation with&#xD;
      conventional ventilation on postoperative complications following major abdominal surgery.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative complications are associated with a significant and quantifiable rate of both&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality, increased length of hospital stay and cost of care. Intra-abdominal&#xD;
      surgery, especially upper abdominal surgery, is an important risk factor of both pulmonary&#xD;
      and extra-pulmonary complications. Up to 15-20% of patients will develop postoperative&#xD;
      respiratory failure which may require respiratory support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent data from both experimental and clinical studies suggested that, compared with&#xD;
      conventional ventilation using high tidal volume (TV) without positive end-expiratory&#xD;
      pressure (PEEP), intraoperative lung protective ventilation using low tidal volume, PEEP and&#xD;
      recruitment maneuvers (RM) could reduce postoperative complications. Conventional ventilation&#xD;
      promotes sustained cytokine production and could therefore contribute to development of lung&#xD;
      injury with in patients with normal lungs. Conversely, lung protective ventilation was found&#xD;
      to reduce pulmonary and systemic inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to compare a lung protective ventilation with conventional&#xD;
      ventilation (high tidal volumes without PEEP) during abdominal surgery: 1- Conventional&#xD;
      ventilation with TV of 10-12 mL/kg predicted body weight (PBW) without PEEP; 2- Protective&#xD;
      lung ventilation with TV of 6-8 mL/kg PBW, PEEP of 6-8 cmH2O and RM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that lung protective ventilation could reduce postoperative pulmonary and&#xD;
      extra-pulmonary complications compared with conventional ventilation.&#xD;
