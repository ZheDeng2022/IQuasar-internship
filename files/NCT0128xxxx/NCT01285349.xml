    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial is designed to address gaps in couple-based HIV prevention&#xD;
      research by focusing exclusively on HIV negative concordant couples where one or both&#xD;
      partners are drug-involved. Building on prior couple-based HIV research that resulted in an&#xD;
      evidence-based HIV prevention model for couples (Connect), intervention components were&#xD;
      modified to address dyadic drug risk reduction and drug-related unsafe sex and a couple-based&#xD;
      HIV risk reduction intervention (Connect II) was designed specifically for drug-involved, HIV&#xD;
      negative concordant heterosexual couples at risk for HIV/STIs. For this RCT, couples are&#xD;
      recruited primarily through street outreach in drug using locations and randomized into one&#xD;
      of three arms: (1) couple-based HIV Risk Reduction condition; (2) individual-based HIV Risk&#xD;
      Reduction, which delivered the same content as the couple-based condition but was provided to&#xD;
      either the male or female drug-using partner alone; or (3) couple-based Wellness Promotion,&#xD;
      which served as an attentional control arm. This RCT tests two major hypotheses: (1) whether&#xD;
      the HIV risk reduction intervention provided to the couple or an individual partner would be&#xD;
      more efficacious in decreasing number of unprotected acts of intercourse and having a lower&#xD;
      cumulative incidence of biologically confirmed STIs over the 12-month follow-up period&#xD;
      compared to the Wellness promotion control arm and (2) whether the couple-based HIV risk&#xD;
      reduction intervention would be more likely to decrease the number of unprotected acts and&#xD;
      have a lower cumulative STI incidence compared to the Individual HIV Risk reduction Arm.&#xD;

      Study Design and Population This prospective, blinded randomized controlled trial was&#xD;
      conducted between November 2004 and September 2009 in West Harlem, New York City.&#xD;
      Participants were recruited through homeless shelters, soup kitchens, syringe exchange&#xD;
      programs, street outreach and &quot;word-of-mouth.&quot; Most qualified couples came through street&#xD;
      outreach. Recruiters informed potential participants about the study, obtained consent to be&#xD;
      screened, and screened them for eligibility. People who seemed to be eligible were asked to&#xD;
      invite their main sexual partner to participate. A letter to their partner that introduced&#xD;
      the study was given to potential participants. Partners interested in participating were&#xD;
      screened. If eligible, the recruiter scheduled the couple for baseline data collection.&#xD;
      Participants received monetary compensation for completing the baseline assessment and each&#xD;
      follow up assessment. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Columbia&#xD;
      University. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Couples were eligible to participate if both were 18 and older and at least one partner was&#xD;
      18-40; (2) both tested HIV negative using Oratest procedures; (3) both identified each other&#xD;
      as main, regular partner, boy/girlfriend, spouse, lover; (4) both reported that they have&#xD;
      been together for at least 6 months; (5) both intended to remain together for at least one&#xD;
      year; (6) at least one partner reported using illicit drugs in the prior 90 days and was&#xD;
      seeking or in drug treatment; (7) at least one partner reported having had unprotected&#xD;
      intercourse with the other in the prior 90 days. Additionally, at least one partner had to&#xD;
      report one or more of the following HIV risk criteria: (1) having had sex with other partners&#xD;
      in the prior 90 days; (2) injecting drugs in the prior 90 days; or (3) self-report being&#xD;
      diagnosed with an STI in the prior 90 days. Couples were excluded from the study (1) if&#xD;
      either partner reported experiencing severe intimate partner violence in the past year by the&#xD;
      other partner as assessed by subscales of the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale (Straus, Hamby&#xD;
      et al. 1996); (2) if either partner exhibited a severe cognitive or psychiatric impairment&#xD;
      assessed during informed consent (3) if either partner did not have sufficient understanding&#xD;
      of English and (4) if either partner reported intentions to have a baby in the next year and&#xD;
      to relocate beyond a reasonable distance from the study site in the coming year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Couples were randomized to the Couple Risk Reduction, Individual Risk&#xD;
      Reduction, or the Couple Wellness Promotion conditions at the time of their arrival at their&#xD;
      first session (within 10 days from baseline, allowing sufficient time to receive HIV and STI&#xD;
      test results). A random number generator was used to assign each couple to one of the three&#xD;
      arms with equal probability. The gender of index participant who reported drug use in the&#xD;
      past 90 days and seeking or in substance abuse participant was used as a blocking factor to&#xD;
      ensure that couples with drug-involved female and male participants were equally balanced&#xD;
      across intervention arms. If both partners met above drug involvement criteria eligibility&#xD;
      criteria, one partner was randomly selected as the index participant. The Data Coordinator&#xD;
      informed the facilitator and couple as to which condition was assigned, entered the treatment&#xD;
      assignment into a case report form that contained only the male and female participants'&#xD;
      study identification numbers, and then destroyed the assignment card and envelope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures All three intervention conditions consisted of seven weekly structured 2-hour&#xD;
      sessions delivered by female and male facilitators who had at least a bachelor's degree and 2&#xD;
      years of clinical experience in the HIV prevention field. Facilitators completed 40 hours of&#xD;
      training and were trained to deliver all three conditions to minimize the threat of&#xD;
      facilitator effects. To ensure the fidelity of implementation of all three conditions,&#xD;
      facilitators used structured manuals with detailed implementation protocols and were asked to&#xD;
      fidelity assessment forms after each session. In addition, facilitators met for weekly&#xD;
      60-minute group supervision to discuss clinical challenges and adherence to the protocol for&#xD;
      all three conditions. All intervention sessions were digitally recorded. Recordings and&#xD;
      session-specific quality assurance checklists were reviewed to monitor fidelity of&#xD;
      implementation of all three conditions and to provide corrective feedback to facilitators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Couple-based HIV risk reduction intervention was guided by social cognitive theory (SCT)&#xD;
      (Bandura 1992) and a relationship-oriented ecological framework (Bronfenbrenner 1979) which&#xD;
      has been described elsewhere (El-Bassel et al., 2001). The core components of the&#xD;
      intervention focus on both sexual and drug risk reduction (1) encouraging both partners to&#xD;
      disclose and identify mutual drug-related and sexual risks (2) modeling, role-playing and&#xD;
      practicing couple communication, negotiation and problem solving skills that both partners&#xD;
      may employ together to reduce their drug-related and sexual risks; (3) practicing technical&#xD;
      condom use placement skills along with a broader repertoire of pleasurable safer sex&#xD;
      activities and syringe disinfection skills and (4) enhancing both couple's motivation to&#xD;
      protect each other and set mutual risk reduction goals. Facilitators are trained to validate&#xD;
      the relationship's strengths (e.g., commitment, love, trust) and empower the dyad to enact&#xD;
      protective behaviors (El-Bassel, 2001, 2005, 2010C). A safe environment is created where&#xD;
      sensitive or taboo topics (e.g., outside sexual partners) related to couple's risks may be&#xD;
      disclosed and addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Individual Risk Reduction Intervention covered the same content, skills and sequencing of&#xD;
      activities as the Couple Risk Reduction, but was delivered to either or the male or female&#xD;
      drug-involved partner in individual sessions by a facilitator of the same gender. In these&#xD;
      individual sessions, facilitators are trained to model and role play communication,&#xD;
      negotiation and problem-solving skills with participants and encourage them to practice these&#xD;
      HIV-related skills and share HIV information with their partners in homework activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Couple Wellness Promotion comparison intervention was designed to control for Hawthorne&#xD;
      effects -- to reduce the likelihood that the effects of Connect II risk reduction&#xD;
      intervention could be attributed to non-specific features, such as special attention, dosage&#xD;
      and couple interaction. Guided by social cognitive theory, the core components of the&#xD;
      intervention consist of 7 weekly sessions and employ the same structure as the HIV risk&#xD;
      reduction sessions which focus on maintaining a healthy diet promoting physical fitness in&#xD;
      daily routines, promoting age appropriate recommendations for screening for common diseases&#xD;
      affecting men and women such as cancers, heart disease, diabetes, etc., improving access to&#xD;
      health care services by identifying and addressing service barriers and learning&#xD;
      stress-reducing exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants in all three conditions provided behavioral and biological outcome data at&#xD;
      baseline, immediate post intervention IPT, 6- and 12-month post-intervention time points. An&#xD;
      Audio Computer Assisted Self-Interview (ACASI) was used to collect self-reported data on&#xD;
      drug-related and sexual behavioral outcomes and socio-demographic variables. ACASI provided&#xD;
      both audio and video presentation of the questions and response options on a computer&#xD;
      enabling participants with low literacy to respond to questions. ACASI was used collect data&#xD;
      on self -reported sexual behaviors from participant with their study partners and with all&#xD;
      other partners in the prior 90 days, including number of vaginal and anal intercourse acts,&#xD;
      number of unprotected vaginal or anal intercourse acts with their study partners and with all&#xD;
      other partners, proportion of condom protected acts of vaginal or anal intercourse (e.g. # of&#xD;
      times condoms were used during vaginal sex/# of acts of vaginal intercourse), consistent&#xD;
      condom use (e.g. used condom100% of time during vaginal sex), and incidence of concurrent&#xD;
      sexual partners in the past 90 days at baseline and all follow-ups. The timeline follow-back&#xD;
      method was used to enhance recall of sexual behaviors (REF). The primary behavioral outcome&#xD;
      was the number of unprotected acts of vaginal intercourse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug risk behavioral outcomes included whether or not and number of times injecting drugs in&#xD;
      the past 90 days and number or times sharing syringes, cookers, cotton, or rinse water with&#xD;
      another user in the past 90 days. In addition, self-reported data on frequency and type of&#xD;
      drug use in the prior 90 days were collected for the following substances: cocaine, crack,&#xD;
      heroin, cannabis, and not prescribed sedatives, opiates and stimulants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To complement self-reports of primary behavioral outcome, we assessed biologically confirmed&#xD;
      STI cumulative incidence over the 12-month follow-up period. All participants were asked to&#xD;
      provide a self-collected urine specimen after completing the ACASI. Molecular assay of urine&#xD;
      specimens for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae using. Urine specimens were&#xD;
      assayed for Trichomonas vaginalis using. Participants with positive STI test results were&#xD;
      referred for single-dose antimicrobial treatment and risk-reduction counseling per CDC&#xD;
      recommendations. If either partner tested positive for an STI, both were recommended for&#xD;
      treatment. If participants tested positive for any STI at any assessment visit, they were&#xD;
      considered an incident STI case for that visit. HIV testing was repeated at the 12-month&#xD;
      follow up assessment using Oratest procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis To assess intervention effects, multilevel mixed-effects models were&#xD;
      constructed. . Each observation at the first level of the model represents an individual&#xD;
      measurement at one of the three post-treatment time points. Random effect parameters in the&#xD;
      model account for dependencies present with each of two types of grouping, couple and time&#xD;
      point. Multilevel mixed-effects Poisson regressions were used to estimate effects of the&#xD;
      intervention on the number of unprotected acts of intercourse. Effect estimates are reported&#xD;
      as incident rate ratios (IRR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Multilevel&#xD;
      mixed-effects linear regressions were used for the proportion of protected acts of&#xD;
      intercourse; adjusted mean differences and 95% confidence intervals are reported. Multilevel&#xD;
      mixed-effects logistic regressions were used to estimate effects on consistent condom use,&#xD;
      having concurrent partners, injecting drugs, sharing needles or syringes, and sharing works,&#xD;
      cooker, cotton, or rinse water; for these effect estimates odds ratios (OR) and 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals are reported. Due to the low prevalence of STI at baseline and low&#xD;
      cumulative incidence over the follow-up period, the biological outcomes were not included in&#xD;
      multilevel analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orthogonal contrast coding was used to test separately for intervention effect (Couple and&#xD;
      Individual Risk Reduction jointly vs. Couple Wellness Promotion) and modality effect (Couple&#xD;
      Risk Reduction vs. Individual Risk Reduction) within one model. To test for an intervention&#xD;
      effect, the coding for Couple Risk Reduction, Individual Risk Reduction and Health Promotion&#xD;
      were +1/3, +1/3, and -2/3 respectively. To test for modality effects, the coding for Couple&#xD;
      Risk Reduction, Individual Risk Reduction and Health Promotion were+1/2, -1/2 and 0&#xD;
      respectively. All the multilevel models adjusted for the baseline measure of the outcome and&#xD;
      gender. The primary analyses used standard intent-to-treat methods in which all available&#xD;
      data on all randomized participants were included.&#xD;
