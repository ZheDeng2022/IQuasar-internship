  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-invasive, energy-based, aesthetic treatments are becoming increasingly popular among&#xD;
      female and male patients of all ages. Different technologies are presently available to&#xD;
      rejuvenate skin, including therapeutic ultrasound, lasers and intense pulsed light (IPL),&#xD;
      however radiofrequency has emerged as the most effective and versatile modality for the&#xD;
      broadest range of body and facial treatments, including non-invasive wrinkle treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The apollo™ system is an RF system, based on the TriPollar™ technology. The technology is&#xD;
      based on three or more electrodes designed to deliver RF current focused into the skin, thus&#xD;
      generating heat in the dermal layer. Selective and focused electro-heating of the skin is&#xD;
      intended to stimulate collagen remodeling in the dermal layer resulting in non invasive&#xD;
      wrinkle treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The apollo™ system is intended for use in dermatologic and general surgical procedures for&#xD;
      non invasive treatment of facial wrinkles and rhytides. This study was designed in order to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Apollo™ System for facial wrinkles and rhytides&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
