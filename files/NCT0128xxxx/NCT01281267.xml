    <textblock>
      Face transplantation surgery is the transfer of face tissue from a deceased human donor to a&#xD;
      patient with a severe facial deformity. Face transplantation is an innovative reconstructive&#xD;
      procedure that has the potential to significantly improve the lives of patients with severe&#xD;
      facial injuries. The purpose of this study is to develop the best practices for facial&#xD;
      transplantation that will improve the outcomes of future face transplant recipients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The United States Department of Defense (DoD) awarded Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) a&#xD;
      research contract to fund 5 face transplantation surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are now actively seeking candidates for the procedure. The primary&#xD;
      requirements to be considered as a candidate for face transplant surgery are: at least 18&#xD;
      years old; lost a major part of the face, such as the nose or the lips, or lost at least 25%&#xD;
      of their facial tissue; and the facial injury cannot be treated acceptably by conventional&#xD;
      reconstructive surgery. There are number of other factors that the investigators consider to&#xD;
      determine who would be a suitable candidate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the time the investigators begin our search for a qualified face transplant recipient to&#xD;
      the continuing care the investigators provide following surgery, a significant amount of&#xD;
      time, expertise, and attentiveness is contributed toward making the procedure a progressive&#xD;
      success. Below is an overview of what happens before, during and after a face transplant&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Face transplant candidates go through an extensive screening process that is likely to last&#xD;
      several months. This screening includes a psychiatric and social support evaluation and a&#xD;
      series of imaging tests to help determine a patient's physical and mental readiness for the&#xD;
      procedure. If, upon completion of the screening process, it is determined that a patient is a&#xD;
      suitable candidate, the investigators will place the patient on a transplant waiting list.&#xD;
      The investigators will then begin working to find a donor who matches the recipient's tissue&#xD;
      requirements - e.g., similar age, right blood type. This search could take many months, and,&#xD;
      if a suitable donor is not found within one year, the investigators will speak with the&#xD;
      patient to determine whether they're willing to continue waiting. When a donor is found, the&#xD;
      investigators will immediately inform the patient about when to arrive at the hospital for&#xD;
      the operation. As the timing for this type of procedure is extremely important, patients are&#xD;
      expected to be readily available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The area most likely to be reconstructed in a face transplant is the central region of the&#xD;
      face, which includes the nose and lips, as these facial structures are the most difficult to&#xD;
      reconstruct with conventional plastic surgery techniques. In our most recent case, the face&#xD;
      transplant included the entire nose; the soft tissues of the mid-face, including all its&#xD;
      blood vessels, muscles, and nerves; and a significant portion of the mid-facial skeleton.&#xD;
      Surgeons will then connect the facial graft blood vessels to the patient's blood vessels&#xD;
      under a microscope to restore blood circulation before connecting nerves and other tissue,&#xD;
      such as bone, cartilage and muscles, as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the face transplant is taking place, a separate, smaller surgery will also be&#xD;
      performed. The investigators will take a skin sample (graft) from the arm of the donor and&#xD;
      then attach the sample to the patient's chest or abdomen. The intent is to have the graft&#xD;
      behave like the face transplant tissue, eventually becoming part of the patient's own skin.&#xD;
      This is done so that later the investigators can take tiny samples (biopsies) of the new&#xD;
      chest/abdomen tissue to look for signs of rejection, thereby minimizing the need to disturb&#xD;
      the new face tissue after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after surgery, the face transplant recipient will be taken to the Intensive Care&#xD;
      Unit (ICU) for observation. The patient will typically stay in the ICU for one or two days&#xD;
      and then be moved to a private room. At this point, a physical therapist will help the&#xD;
      patient regain as much facial movement as possible, and a psychiatrist will discuss any&#xD;
      psychological concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will stay in the hospital until both the plastic surgery and medical transplant&#xD;
      teams agree that it is safe for the patient to return home. This post-operative stay is&#xD;
      anticipated to be approximately 7-14 days, but can vary due to a number of factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following their discharge, face transplant patients will need to return to BWH for routine&#xD;
      visits. These visits will include monitoring transplant drug levels (immune suppressants)&#xD;
      through regular blood tests, imaging tests, assessing quality of life and checking for the&#xD;
      return of sensation and movement to the face. The investigators will also periodically&#xD;
      examine small tissue samples from the chest/abdomen graft under a microscope to look for any&#xD;
      signs of rejection. These visits will typically take place on a weekly basis for the first&#xD;
      three months and then at least once a month for the first year following surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first year, it is expected that face transplant patients will need to visit the&#xD;
      hospital less and less as time passes. However, patients should be prepared to make a&#xD;
      lifetime commitment to immune suppressants to help prevent the rejection of the transplanted&#xD;
      face tissue.&#xD;
