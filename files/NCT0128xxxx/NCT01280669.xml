  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out about the safety and effectiveness of two different&#xD;
      doses the study drug, sirolimus, administered intravitreally in patients with uveitis. The&#xD;
      potential effectiveness of sirolimus can be utilized to control inflammation in uveitis and&#xD;
      yet avoid the potential complications that are usually associated with the systemic use of&#xD;
      the drug and other immunomodulatory therapies. In this study, the investigators will&#xD;
      administer sirolimus inside the eye (intravitreally) in one of two doses (440mcg/mcL or&#xD;
      880mcg/mcL). Local administration of sirolimus to the eye is not expected to have effects on&#xD;
      the rest of the body. Therefore, it may offer a safer way than the current methods used to&#xD;
      control the inflammation caused by non-infectious uveitis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Uveitis is a condition in which certain parts of your eye become inflamed. The inflammation&#xD;
      is usually recurrent. If the inflammation is not treated adequately, permanent damage to the&#xD;
      eye and to the vision may occur. The inflammation can be caused by infectious or non&#xD;
      infectious causes. The current research is being done to determine the safety and the&#xD;
      usefulness of treatment of non-infectious uveitis using different doses of intravitreal&#xD;
      injections of a drug called sirolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatment options for uveitis include oral corticosteroids and drugs that weaken the&#xD;
      immune system of the body (i.e., immunosuppressant drugs). Treatment using oral&#xD;
      corticosteroids, especially for long periods, may cause many undesirable side effects and&#xD;
      complications such as high blood sugar, high blood pressure, bone weakness, obesity, stomach&#xD;
      ulcers, abnormal hair growth, and increased risks of infection. In addition to that, in some&#xD;
      cases, the disease cannot be controlled even with the highest dose of steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injection of steroids around and inside the eye can be used to control uveitis. However, the&#xD;
      inflammation does not always respond to such kind of treatment. The eyes may develop high&#xD;
      pressure and cataract with injections of steroids into the eyes or around the eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, despite their potential effectiveness, treatment with drugs that weaken&#xD;
      the immune system may cause severe side effects. Increased risk of infection is a common side&#xD;
      effect of all the immunosuppressant drugs. The immune system protects the body from&#xD;
      infections. When the immune system is suppressed, infections are more likely to happen. Some&#xD;
      of these infections are potentially dangerous. Because the immune system protects the body&#xD;
      against some forms of cancer, immunosuppressant drugs are also associated with a slightly&#xD;
      increased risk of cancer. For example, long-term use of immunosuppressant drugs may carry an&#xD;
      increased risk of developing skin cancer as a result of the combination of the drugs and&#xD;
      exposure to sunlight. The immunosuppressive drugs are very powerful and can cause serious&#xD;
      side effects such as high blood pressure, kidney problems, and liver problems. Some side&#xD;
      effects may not show up until years after the medicine is used.&#xD;
