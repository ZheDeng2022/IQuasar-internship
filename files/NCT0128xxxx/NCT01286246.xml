  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prematurity remains the most important single factor in perinatal morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, the rate of premature delivery is increasing in Canada and is especially high&#xD;
      in Alberta with 7.5% of pregnancies ending before 37 weeks gestation. Despite years of&#xD;
      research into the causes of spontaneous preterm labor, few effective treatments have been&#xD;
      identified. Progesterone is one candidate treatment. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate whether progesterone can prolong pregnancy in women who have symptoms of preterm&#xD;
      labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women who have symptoms of premature labor will be invited to take part in the study&#xD;
      if they are between 22 to 24 weeks pregnant. If they agree to join the study, they will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated to either take progesterone 200mg each day via the vagina until 36 weeks,&#xD;
      or to take a placebo preparation. Neither the women nor their clinician will know which group&#xD;
      they are in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women and their babies will be followed until 28 days after the birth, to find out about the&#xD;
      length of the pregnancy, any adverse events that might occur (none have been reported in&#xD;
      previous trials), and to look at whether women have taken the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the study is complete, the results for the progesterone group will be compared to the&#xD;
      placebo group. If progesterone is found to be useful in helping to prolong pregnancy, then&#xD;
      this will be a possible treatment to help mothers in the future.&#xD;
