  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AC430 will be administered, orally under fasting conditions (fasting 4 hours before and 2&#xD;
      hours after dosing) with approximately 240 mL of water either once daily or twice daily. It&#xD;
      is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple&#xD;
      oral doses of AC430.&#xD;
