  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While clinical phlebotomy is current standard practice for alleviating non-transfusion iron&#xD;
      overload in patients with PCT, it may not be suitable for all patients. For example, some&#xD;
      patients are unwilling to be adequately phlebotomized because of inconvenience, as phlebotomy&#xD;
      can be cumbersome, especially during the induction treatment phase requiring frequent clinic&#xD;
      visits (twice a month, for at least 6 months) or because of venous access difficulties. Other&#xD;
      patients are unable to undergo phlebotomy due to medical reasons such as anemia or&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary disorders. It is postulated such patients with PCT who have non-transfusion&#xD;
      iron overload could benefit from treatment with deferasirox (Exjade®), a once daily oral iron&#xD;
      chelator licensed in several countries, including the EU, for treating transfusion iron&#xD;
      overload in adult and pediatric patients. Although there is some data on the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of deferasirox in patients with HH, who, like those with PCT, have non-transfusional&#xD;
      iron overload, there is a need to evaluate the safety and efficacy of deferasirox treatment&#xD;
      of non-transfusion iron overload in patients with PCT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The primary objective is to assess the safety of deferasirox in treating non-transfusion iron&#xD;
      overload in patients with PCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to assess the effectiveness of deferasirox treatment :&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 3 and 6 months to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      •Lower serum ferritin from abnormal to normal standard ranges specified for males and females&#xD;
      in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 6 months to :&#xD;
&#xD;
      •Lower liver iron content after 24 weeks of treatment measured by liver MRI T2&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 3 and 6 months to :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improve clinical symptoms, i.e. improvement in skin lesions (reduction or no new bullae&#xD;
           formation), and skin fragility (photographs will be used).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduce porphyrin levels.&#xD;

             familial as per the European Porphyria Network guidelines i.e. increased urinary and&#xD;
             plasma porphyrins and faecal isocoproporphyrin detected by fluorescence emission&#xD;
             spectroscopy,&#xD;
