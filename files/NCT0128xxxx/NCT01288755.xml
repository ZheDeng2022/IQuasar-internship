  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of steady-state concentrations of&#xD;
      raltegravir (administered as 400 mg, twice daily) on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      TMC278 (25 mg, once daily), and vice versa. Steady state is a term that means that the drug&#xD;
      has been given long enough so that the plasma levels will remain at about the same level with&#xD;
      each subsequent dose. TMC278 is being investigated for the treatment of human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Raltegravir is a commercially available&#xD;
      antiretroviral drug for treatment of HIV infection. Pharmacokinetics (PK) means how the drug&#xD;
      is absorbed into the bloodstream, distributed in the body and eliminated from the body.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      TMC278 is being investigated for treatment of HIV infection. Raltegravir is a commercially&#xD;
      available HIV drug. The results of this study will provide dosing recommendations for&#xD;
      coadministration of TMC278 and raltegravir in HIV-infected patients. This is a Phase I,&#xD;
      open-label (both participant and investigator know the name of the medication given at a&#xD;
      certain moment), randomized (sequence of treatment with study medications is assigned by&#xD;
      chance), crossover trial in 24 healthy volunteers to investigate the pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      interaction between TMC278 and raltegravir, at steady state. The study will consist of 3&#xD;
      phases: a screening phase, an open-label treatment phase consisting of 2 treatment periods,&#xD;
      and end-of-study or withdrawal assessments. The duration of participation in the study for an&#xD;
      individual participant will be up to 3 months (including screening). All participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to 1 of 2 possible treatment sequences and receive the following 2&#xD;
      treatments (Trt-s): TMC278 25 mg, once daily, alone for 11 days (TrtA), and raltegravir 400&#xD;
      mg, twice daily, alone for 4 days immediately followed by coadministration of the same&#xD;
      raltegravir dose plus TMC278 25 mg, once daily, for 11 days (TrtB+C). There will be a washout&#xD;
      period (a period where no study drug will be taken in view of having all the medication&#xD;
      eliminated from the body before starting a new treatment) of at least 14 days between last&#xD;
      intake of study medication in one session and first intake of study medication in the&#xD;
      subsequent session. Pharmacokinetic profiles of both compounds will be determined through&#xD;
      blood samples taken at regular intervals during the study. Safety and tolerability will be&#xD;
      assessed during the study period and in follow-up. Blood and urine samples, electrocardiogram&#xD;
      (ECG) and vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate) will be taken at screening, before&#xD;
      medication intake in TrtA on Days 1, 11, and 12 (Day 12 is without ECG), in TrtB+C on Days 1,&#xD;
      4, 5, 15, and 16 (Day 16 is without ECG) and at the 2 follow-up visits (but without ECG) at 1&#xD;
      week and 4 weeks after last dose of study medication in the last session. A physical&#xD;
      examination will be performed at screening, on Days 10 and 12 of TrtA, on Days 3, 14, and 16&#xD;
      of TrtB+C, and at both follow-up visits. Healthy volunteers will stay overnight in the study&#xD;
      center for 3 nights in TrtA and for 5 nights in TrtB+C. Each volunteer will receive in a&#xD;
      randomized order 2 treatments, minimum 14 days apart from each other. TrtA is TMC278 25 mg,&#xD;
      once daily, for 11 days. TrtB+C is raltegravir 400 mg, twice daily, alone for first 4 days&#xD;
      (TrtB) followed by coadministration of 400 mg raltegravir, twice daily, and TMC278 25 mg,&#xD;
      once daily, on Days 5 to 15 (TrtC).&#xD;
