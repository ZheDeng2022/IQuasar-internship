      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan hydrochloride, work in different&#xD;
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing. Chemoembolization kills tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor and keeping&#xD;
      chemotherapy drugs near the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well chemoembolization using irinotecan works in&#xD;
      treating patients with liver metastases from metastatic colon or rectal cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To define the response rate of colorectal liver metastases (in the treated lobe) treated&#xD;
      with DEBIRI, in refractory mCRC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the time to progression in the treated lobe for this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the overall survival for this patient population. III. To evaluate patient&#xD;
      tolerance and the toxicity profile of treatment with DEBIRI in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive irinotecan-eluting beads via hepatic artery embolization every 3 weeks for&#xD;
      up to 3 (unilobar disease) or 4 (bi-lobar disease) courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3&#xD;
      months for 2 years.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will be treated with drug-eluting irinotecan beads per protocol at up to 100 mg per dose every 3 weeks. Patients will receive chemoembolization using LC Bead, loaded with irinotecan. The beads size range used in the study will be 100-300Âµm (nominal) with a dose of up to 100mg irinotecan per treatment. The beads will be mixed with a non-ionic contrast media in the vial immediately prior to use according to the instructions for use. Irinotecan will be loaded onto the beads not more than 2 hours prior to the procedure. The study goal will be to deliver the full dose of 100mg of irinotecan per treatment</description>

    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>hepatic artery embolization</intervention_name>
    <description>Using a unilateral femoral approach, selective catheterization of the hepatic artery will be performed. Vascular access is obtained via the common femoral artery and a guide-wire advanced under fluoroscopic guidance. A microcatheter is then inserted over the guide-wire. The superior mesenteric artery is selected and an angiogram performed to identify any aberrant arterial anatomy and verify antegrade portal vein flow. The celiac axis is then selected and an angiogram completed. The catheter and guide-wire are used to select the proper hepatic artery and a limited angiogram performed to identify the branches of the hepatic artery. The right or left hepatic artery is selected distal to the cystic artery (if visualized), depending on the location of the lesions to be treated. The LC Bead, loaded with irinotecan will be delivered into the artery.</description>
