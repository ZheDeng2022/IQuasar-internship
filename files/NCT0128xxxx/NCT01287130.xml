      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The experimental cancer treatment drug AZD6244 has been shown to block signals that tell&#xD;
      cancer cells to grow. Cetuximab, a drug approved to treat cancer of the head, neck, colon,&#xD;
      and rectum, also blocks signals that tell cancer cells to grow. Researchers are investigating&#xD;
      the highest safe dose of AZD6244 to give with cetuximab, and will also investigate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of this drug combination in individuals who have colorectal cancer that&#xD;
      involves a particular protein known as the K-RAS protein. Cetuximab is not used to treat&#xD;
      colorectal cancer with K-RAS tumors because it has not been shown to be effective, but&#xD;
      researchers believe that adding AZD6244 to cetuximab may improve how well cetuximab works,&#xD;
      even in people with K-RAS tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of AZD6244 in combination with cetuximab for&#xD;
           solid tumors that have not responded to standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of AZD6244 in combination with cetuximab for&#xD;
           colorectal cancer that involves the K-RAS protein and has not responded to standard&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with solid tumors that have&#xD;
           not responded to standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with colorectal cancer that&#xD;
           has not responded to standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This protocol will involve two separate studies: an initial study to establish the&#xD;
           highest safe and effective dose of AZD6244 and cetuximab in individuals with solid&#xD;
           tumors, and an expansion study of AZD6244 and cetuximab in individuals with colorectal&#xD;
           cancer involving the K-RAS protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a full medical history and physical examination,&#xD;
           blood samples, imaging studies, and other tests as required by the researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AZD6244 is a capsule to be swallowed once or twice a day, every day, with water on an&#xD;
           empty stomach. Cetuximab will be given intravenously once a week, over 2 hours for the&#xD;
           first dose and over an hour for every following dose. This combination of daily AZD6244&#xD;
           and weekly cetuximab will be repeated in 28-day cycles of treatment. Participants will&#xD;
           keep a diary to record the time of taking AZD6244 each day, as well as any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have frequent blood tests and other exams during the first cycle of&#xD;
           treatment, up to five visits to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other visits&#xD;
           to their local doctor to in the first 28-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During subsequent cycles, participants will have four visits to NIH and four visits to&#xD;
           your local doctor for examinations, blood tests, and imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may continue to receive the AZD6244 with cetuximab for up to 6 cycles,&#xD;
           until the tumor grows, unacceptable side effects development, or the participant or&#xD;
           participant's doctor decides to stop participation. There will be a final study visit&#xD;
           that repeats the procedures performed during the screening visit....&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AZD6244 is an oral highly selective and potent uncompetitive inhibitor of&#xD;
           mitogen-activated protein kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The presence of KRAS mutations predict resistance to EGFR-directed antibody therapy of&#xD;
           metastatic colorectal cancer. This appears secondary to KRAS activation of signaling&#xD;
           cascades downstream of the EGFR receptor, including the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Our hypothesis is that EGFR inhibition by cetuximab would be augmented in patients with&#xD;
           KRAS mutations if activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK cascade were to be inhibited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the dose limiting toxicities and the maximum tolerated dose of AZD6244 in&#xD;
           combination with cetuximab in advanced, refractory solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess for evidence of anti-tumor activity with this combination, per tumor&#xD;
           measurements using RECIST criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of AZD6244 and cetuximab when administered&#xD;
           concomitantly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of AZD6244 and cetuximab in&#xD;
           patients with K-RAS mutated metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the inhibition of the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway in peripheral blood mononuclear&#xD;
           cells secondary to treatment with AZD6244.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of AZD6244 in combination with cetuximab and the&#xD;
           relation to treatment side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have histologically confirmed malignancy that is metastatic or&#xD;
           unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are&#xD;
           no longer effective. In the MTD expansion cohort: Patients must have biopsy proven K-RAS&#xD;
           mutant, metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a phase 1 dose escalation study of AZD6244 in combination with fixed-dose&#xD;
           cetuximab with an expanded cohort in K-RAS mutated metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be treated with AZD6244 orally twice daily continuously, and cetuximab&#xD;
           will be administered at standard doses on days 1, 8, 15 and 22. Dose escalations are&#xD;
           outlined per the schema in the parent protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The dose of AZD6244 will be escalated using a 3-patient cohort design based on first&#xD;
           cycle toxicities until dose limiting toxicities (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
           are defined. Once the MTD/RP2D has been identified, an additional 12 patients with K-RAS&#xD;
           mutant colorectal cancer will be enrolled at that dose level, in an effort to more fully&#xD;
           characterize pharmacokinetic characteristics of this combination. If at least an 8%&#xD;
           response rate is observed in the expanded cohort, the combination will be recommended&#xD;
           for future analysis.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the dose escalation cohorts: Patients must have histologically confirmed malignancy&#xD;
             that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative&#xD;
             measures do not exist or are no longer effective. Histology can be based on either the&#xD;
             primary tumor or metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the MTD expansion cohort: Patients must have biopsy proven K-RAS mutant, metastatic&#xD;
             colorectal cancer that has progressed on at least 2 prior standard therapies. K-RAS&#xD;
             mutation status must be verified by a CLIA-certified laboratory. (NOTE: colorectal&#xD;
             patients enrolled during the dose escalation portion do not need to be K-RAS mutant in&#xD;
             order to be eligible).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be at least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy, 6 weeks if the last&#xD;
             regimen included nitrosureas or mitomycin C. Prior radiation is allowed as long as the&#xD;
             radiation was completed 4 weeks prior to study treatment and no more than 35% of&#xD;
             marrow irradiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than or equal to18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are&#xD;
             currently available on the use of AZD6244 in combination with cetuximab in patients&#xD;
             less than 18 years of age, children are excluded from this study, but will be eligible&#xD;
             for future pediatric phase 1 combination trials.&#xD;

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 X institutional upper limit of&#xD;
                  normal (AST and ALT less than or equal to 5.0 X institutional upper limit of&#xD;
                  normal will be permitted if liver metastases are present)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine less than or equal to to to1.5X institution upper limit of normal OR&#xD;
                  creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, as calculated by&#xD;
                  Cockroft-Gault formula, for patients with creatinine levels above institutional&#xD;
                  normal. May use a 24 hr. urine collection to determine creatinine clearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have received prior cetuximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with brain metastases that have been treated and stable for 2 months will be&#xD;
             eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects undergoing anti-coagulation therapy with LMWH and warfarin are eligible.&#xD;
             Subjects receiving both warfarin and AZD6244 should have more frequent PT/INR&#xD;
             monitoring (see section 10.0)&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy, radiotherapy or hormonal therapy within 4 weeks (6&#xD;
             weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have&#xD;
             not recovered (less than or equal to grade 1) from adverse events due to agents&#xD;
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent treatment with an investigational agent other than the investigational&#xD;
             agent(s) used in this study OR treatment within 4 weeks of study entry with any&#xD;
             investigational agent(s) or device(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Failure to recover fully (as judged by the investigator) from prior surgical&#xD;
             procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to AZD6244 or other agents used in study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients taking high doses (more than recommended daily dose) of vitamin E will be&#xD;
             excluded. Patients can discontinue use of high dose vitamin E prior to study entry to&#xD;
             be considered eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition (e.g., gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in an inability to take&#xD;
             oral medication or a requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical procedures&#xD;
             affecting absorption, or active peptic ulcer disease) that impairs their ability to&#xD;
             swallow and retain AZD6244 capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with malabsorption syndrome, disease significantly affecting gastrointestinal&#xD;
             function, or resection of the stomach or small bowel are excluded. Subjects with&#xD;
             ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, or a partial or complete small bowel&#xD;
             obstruction are also excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, prior&#xD;
             cardiomyopathy, LVEF less than 50%, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia (i.e.&#xD;
             atrial fibrillation), or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because AZD6244 is a small molecule kinase&#xD;
             inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there&#xD;
             is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with AZD6244, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with AZD6244. These potential risks may also apply to other agents&#xD;
             used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with AZD6244. In addition, these&#xD;
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients&#xD;
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are serologically positive for Hepatitis B or C, or have a history of&#xD;
             liver disease, other forms of hepatitis or cirrhosis are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of strong CYP1A2 or 3A4 inducers and/or inhibitors (for example, but not limited&#xD;
             to, ketoconazole, rifampacin, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole,&#xD;
             nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO),&#xD;
             voriconazole, grapefruit or grapefruit juice, ifabutin, rifapentine, phenytoin,&#xD;
             carbamazepine, phenobarbital and St. John's Wort) is not permitted while on study or&#xD;
             within 7 days prior to study enrollment.&#xD;
