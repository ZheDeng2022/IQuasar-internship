  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial will be conducted in subjects with uncomplicated Plasmodium&#xD;
      vivax malaria during November 2010 to March 2012. The aim of the study is to compare the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of artesunate-amodiaquine plus primaquine (AS-AQ + PQ) and&#xD;
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus primaquine (DHP + PQ) in uncomplicated vivax malaria. The&#xD;
      significance of the study is to find alternative drug for treating patients with vivax&#xD;
      malaria in case the standard treatment is not available or become resistance. This study will&#xD;
      give thorough information about the efficacy and safety of 2 artemisinin-based combination&#xD;
      therapies (ACTs) in combination with primaquine. It will also inform the Indonesian Ministry&#xD;
      of Health on their suggested policies for radical cure of vivax malaria, and provides&#xD;
      evidence based treatment options for chloroquine resistant vivax malaria. This study will&#xD;
      also provide information about prevalence of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)&#xD;
      deficiency and G6PD variants in North Sumatera population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The emergence and spread of drug resistance are major problems in the control of malaria.&#xD;
      Resistance to chloroquine in P. vivax was first detected in 1989 then spread to other parts&#xD;
      of the world. In Indonesia, resistance of P. vivax to chloroquine has emerged in many parts&#xD;
      of the country, ranging from over 50% failure rates in Papua to 20% failure rates in Nias,&#xD;
      North Sumatera. Artemisinin derivatives are the most potent and rapidly acting antimalarial&#xD;
      drugs available nowadays and also seem to be effective for treatment of vivax malaria, but&#xD;
      the number of studies evaluating this is limited. If artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs)&#xD;
      are combined with drug that can eliminate parasites in the liver, such as primaquine, this&#xD;
      will further optimize the treatment of P. vivax infections. The addition of a course of&#xD;
      primaquine will provide radical cure from relapse, and importantly will reduce the&#xD;
      transmission of infection because of its gametocyticidal effects. Since 2008, Indonesian&#xD;
      government has deployed artesunate-amodiaquine (AS-AQ) as the first line treatment for&#xD;
      uncomplicated vivax malaria and promotes radical cure by adding primaquine (PQ). For more&#xD;
      than 50 years, Indonesia has used standard dose of primaquine (0.25mg/kg for 14 days)&#xD;
      sometimes without prior test of G6PD status of the patients because the screening test is not&#xD;
      usually available especially in remote areas. Unfortunately, there is no data to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of this standard dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with fever or history of fever in preceding 48 hours who are attending the public&#xD;
      health centre in study area (study centre) will be examined. Thick and thin blood smear will&#xD;
      be taken, stained and examined under light microscope. Slides will be carefully read&#xD;
      (according the procedure) for P. vivax malaria. The patients will be assessed by the trial&#xD;
      doctor, if they meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, they&#xD;
      will receive detail explanation on study &amp; enrolment condition by trial staff. If they agree&#xD;
      to participate in the study, they will sign the informed consent form and will be randomized&#xD;
      to receive either AS-AQ plus PQ or DHP plus PQ. Essential laboratory tests (hemoglobin, and&#xD;
      methemoglobin) will be performed, and filter blood paper for G6PD genotyping will be&#xD;
      collected. No patients will be screened for G6PD status. Oral treatment dose will be given&#xD;
      under close observation, those who vomit within half an hour will be re-dosed; if they vomit&#xD;
      again they will be withdrawn. Patients will be managed as outpatient and be asked to return&#xD;
      to the clinic daily, on fourteen consecutive days, days 1-14) to receive physical&#xD;
      examination, laboratory test and study treatment and adverse events monitoring, and then&#xD;
      weekly on days 21, 28, 35, 42 or any day if feel unwell. Patients who missed their&#xD;
      appointments on scheduled day after day 3 will still be included in the study if they appear&#xD;
      on the next day (24 hours), or will be visited at home. Patients who develop any acute&#xD;
      hemolytic attack symptoms or reduction on hemoglobin during treatment will be closely&#xD;
      observed and transfer to hospital for blood transfusion if needed and withdrawn from the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After days 42, patients will be visited at home every month (± 1 week from scheduled day will&#xD;
      still be accepted) for up to 1 year. Each patient will be given serial number and an&#xD;
      appointment card marked with the dates of follow-up.&#xD;
