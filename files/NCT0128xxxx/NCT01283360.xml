      After completing a screening evaluation, 280 eligible participants, including 40 sex workers,&#xD;
      will be enrolled into Stage 1A of the study during which they will undergo a baseline medical&#xD;
      evaluation for both history and presence of STIs and anorectal health pathologies or&#xD;
      injuries, as well as a detailed Web-based baseline behavioral assessment. The first 140&#xD;
      eligible participants, including 20 sex workers, reporting at least one occasion of&#xD;
      unprotected RAI in the previous 3 months will be invited to enroll into Stage 1B. In Stage 1B&#xD;
      participants will apply the universal placebo gel (HEC) rectally prior to each episode of RAI&#xD;
      over a 3-month period, reporting each use via a phone reporting system; they will complete a&#xD;
      Web-based questionnaire and take part in a video teleconference at the end of the 3 months.&#xD;
      The first 24 eligible participants completing Stage 1B will be invited to enroll in Stage 2.&#xD;
      The subset of sex workers who took part in Stages 1A and 1B will terminate participation at&#xD;
      the end of 1B. Eligible participants will be randomized to receive either tenofovir 1% gel or&#xD;
      HEC placebo gel as part of Stage 2, the Phase 1 safety study. Following a baseline visit,&#xD;
      participants will return to the clinic, where a single dose of the study gel will be&#xD;
      administered. Within approximately 30 minutes, rectal swab and rectal biopsy specimens will&#xD;
      be obtained via anoscopy. After a one-week recovery period participants will return to the&#xD;
      clinic for assessment. If no significant adverse events (AEs) are reported they will begin to&#xD;
      self-administer once-daily outpatient doses of the study gel for 7 days, after which they&#xD;
      will return to the clinic for evaluation and specimen collection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Microbicides are products that can be applied in the vagina or rectum to decrease the chances&#xD;
      of transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV. In the US, one of&#xD;
      the most vulnerable groups for acquiring HIV infection is young men, especially young Black&#xD;
      and Latino men who have sex with men (MSM). This study will be conducted with a young 18-30&#xD;
      year-old ethnically diverse sample of HIV-negative MSM who report engaging in receptive anal&#xD;
      intercourse (RAI) using condoms inconsistently or not at all. Our goal is to test whether&#xD;
      patterns of use of a placebo rectal gel prior to RAI suggest that the product would be used&#xD;
      correctly and consistently in real life circumstances and whether this highly vulnerable&#xD;
      population could safely use tenofovir gel, a microbicide candidate. In Version 3.0 of this&#xD;
      multicentered protocol, a cohort of 40 male and transgender female sex workers were added to&#xD;
      Stages 1A and 1B in order to determine the feasibility of recruitment and retention of men&#xD;
      who have sex with men (MSM) with high risk sexual behavior, such as sex workers, for&#xD;
      microbicide studies, and their likelihood to use noncondom based HIV prevention strategies.&#xD;
      This study will be conducted by the University of Pittsburgh in collaboration with&#xD;
      researchers at the HIV Center for Clinical and BehavioralStudies at Columbia University; the&#xD;
      Fenway Community Health in Boston; and the University of Puerto Rico Clinical Trial Unit in&#xD;
      San Juan, Puerto Rico. Subjects will be enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh, Fenway&#xD;
      Community Health, and the University of Puerto Rico. This is a two-stage longitudinal study&#xD;
      including a clinical and behavioral evaluation (Stage 1A) with an acceptability and adherence&#xD;
      trial (Stage 1B), followed by a Phase 1 randomized, double-blind, multi-site,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial (Stage 2). Participants who complete Stage 1A are eligible to be&#xD;
      selected for enrollment into Stage 1B; a similar transition occurs between Stage 1B and Stage&#xD;
      2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Stage 1A, approximately 280 MSM between the ages of 18-30 will be enrolled, including&#xD;
           a subset of 40 sex workers and will undergo a baseline medical evaluation and a detailed&#xD;
           Web-based baseline behavioral assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Stage 1B, approximately 140 participants from Satge 1A, including a subset of 20 sex&#xD;
           workers, will be asked to apply a placebo gel (HEC) rectally prior to each episode of&#xD;
           RAI over a 3-month period, reporting each use via a phone reporting system. At the end&#xD;
           of the 3 months, participants will complete a Web-based questionnaire and take part in a&#xD;
           video teleconference.The first 42 eligible participants, excluding the mal and&#xD;
           transgender female sex worker cohort, (approximately 14 at each site) completing Stage&#xD;
           1B with a reported adherence of 80% or greater will be invited to enroll in Stage 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Stage 2, approximately 24 eligible participants from Stage 1B will progress to Stage&#xD;
           2 and be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to tenofovir 1% gel or HEC placebo gel.Following a&#xD;
           baseline visit, participants will return to the clinic, where a single dose of the study&#xD;
           gel will be administered. Within approximately 30 minutes, rectal swab, stool, and&#xD;
           rectal biopsy specimens will be obtained via anoscopy. After a one-week recovery period&#xD;
           participants will return to the clinic for assessment. If no significant adverse&#xD;
           events(AEs) are reported they will begin to self-administer once-daily outpatient doses&#xD;
           of the study gel for 7 days, after which they will return to the clinic for evaluation&#xD;
           and specimen collection.&#xD;
