      This Phase II study will use the MTD from a previous Phase I study at the recommended dose&#xD;
      for the combination regimen from the Phase I trial, Doxil 25mg/m2 IV Q 4 weeks and&#xD;
      temsirolimus 25mg IV Q week.&#xD;

      This proposal aims to capitalize on the consensus recommendations of the NCI panel, the known&#xD;
      antitumor activity of doxorubicin in HCC, and the as yet unpublished results of a recently&#xD;
      completed Phase I clinical trial (WU HRPO# 07-0447, NCT00703170) combining pegylated&#xD;
      liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil®) and temsirolimus (Torisel®) in patients with advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors. In this Phase I study, twenty-two patients were enrolled and treated. The MTD and&#xD;
      recommended Phase II dose for the combination regimen from this trial is is Doxil 25mg/m2 IV&#xD;
      Q 4 weeks and temsirolimus 25mg IV Q week. During the conduct of this study two patients&#xD;
      experienced confirmed partial responses (PR). One patient had heavily pretreated metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer and remained on the study for 6 months. The second patient with a PR had HCC&#xD;
      that was previously treated with sorafenib. She remained on the study regimen for 14 months&#xD;
      and tolerated this treatment well. Based on the tolerability of the drug combination and the&#xD;
      observed anti-tumor activity in HCC, the current Phase II study in HCC is proposed.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologic Diagnosis: Patients must have a histologically or cytologically proven&#xD;
             hepatocellular cancer (HCC) that is not amenable to treatment via resection or liver&#xD;
             transplantation. In the absence of a tissue diagnosis, nodules on CT with a&#xD;
             characteristic appearance of HCC plus Alpha Fetoprotein (AFP) &gt; 400ng/ml will be&#xD;
             considered diagnostic of HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable Disease: Patients must have measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at least one&#xD;
        dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥20 mm with conventional techniques (PET,&#xD;
        CT, MRI, x-ray) or as ≥10 mm with spiral CT scan. All tumor measurements must be recorded&#xD;
        in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters).&#xD;
&#xD;
        A positive bone scan, osteoblastic metastases, and pleural or peritoneal effusions are not&#xD;
        considered measurable. Patients with only these lesions are not eligible for entry to the&#xD;
        study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior Therapy: Patients may or may not have received prior systemic therapy in the&#xD;
             metastatic setting. No prior treatment with an mTOR inhibitor or with doxorubicin is&#xD;
             permitted. Participants must have recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior&#xD;
             chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy prior to entering this study. No&#xD;
             chemotherapy or radiotherapy may be given within 4 weeks prior to the start of&#xD;
             protocol treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age: Patients must be ≥18 years old. Because no dosing or toxicity data are currently&#xD;
             available on the use of temsirolimus in combination with pegylated liposomal&#xD;
             doxorubicin in patients &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Performance Status: ECOG 0-2 at study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life Expectancy: Patients must have a life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Required Laboratory Values:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  platelets ≥100,000/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤1.5 x ULN (≤2.5 x ULN for patients with liver metastases)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  alkaline phosphatase ≤2.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.732 for patients with creatinine levels above 2.0&#xD;
             mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  serum cholesterol ≤350 mg/dL /9.0 mmol/L (fasting)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  triglycerides ≤400 mg/dL (fasting)*&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  albumin ≥3.0 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with triglyceride levels &gt;400 mg/dL can be started on lipid lowering&#xD;
                  agents and reevaluated within 1 week. If levels go to ≤400 mg/dL, they can be&#xD;
                  considered for the trial and continue the lipid lowering agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Child-Pugh (CP) A or B liver dysfunction are eligible unless the bilirubin is&#xD;
                  &gt;1.5 x ULN. If non-contraindicated, hepatic impairment (bilirubin &gt;1-1.5 x ULN or&#xD;
                  AST &gt;ULN but bilirubin ≤ULN) is present patients can be treated at a lower dose&#xD;
                  (15 mg/week) of temsirolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant Medications: Temsirolimus is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Patients&#xD;
             cannot be receiving enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs; e.g., phenytoin,&#xD;
             carbamazepine, phenobarbital) nor any other CYP3A4 inducer such as rifampin or St.&#xD;
             John's wort, as these may decrease temsirolimus levels. A partial list of agents which&#xD;
             interact with cytochrome P450 (CYP3A) is found in Appendix B. Use of agents that&#xD;
             potently inhibit CYP3A (and hence may raise temsirolimus levels), such as&#xD;
             ketoconazole, is discouraged, but not specifically prohibited. Temsirolimus can&#xD;
             inhibit CYP2D6, and may decrease metabolism (and increase drug levels) of drugs that&#xD;
             are substrates for CYP2D6, such as codeine. The appropriateness of use of such agents&#xD;
             is left to physician discretion. A list of drugs that may have potential interactions&#xD;
             with CYP2D6 is found in Appendix A. If there is any doubt about eligibility based on&#xD;
             concomitant medication, the Principal Investigator should be contacted. All&#xD;
             concomitant medications must be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known Allergies: Patients with known hypersensitivity reactions to macrolide&#xD;
             antibiotics (such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin) are not eligible&#xD;
             for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cardiac Function: Patients must have a normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF&#xD;
             ≥50%) by MUGA scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sexually Active Patients: For all sexually active patients, the use of adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control) will be required prior to&#xD;
             study entry and for the duration of study participation. Non-pregnant status will be&#xD;
             determined in all women of childbearing potential. Pregnant and nursing women are not&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-Positive Patients: Patients receiving anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) for HIV&#xD;
             infection are excluded from the study because of possible pharmacokinetic&#xD;
             interactions. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving HAART&#xD;
             therapy, when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neurologic Status: Patients must not have active CNS disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recovery from Intercurrent Illness: Patients must have recovered from uncontrolled&#xD;
             intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection,&#xD;
             symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris or cardiac arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Informed Consent: Patients must have signed a Washington University Human Research&#xD;
             Protection Office (HRPO) approved informed consent. The patient should not have any&#xD;
             serious medical or psychiatric illness that would prevent either the giving of&#xD;
             informed consent or the receipt of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inclusion of Women and Minorities: Entry to this study is open to both men and women&#xD;
             and to all racial and ethnic subgroups.&#xD;
