    <textblock>
      Medical imaging is one of the fastest growing sectors in health care and increases in&#xD;
      utilization underscore the need to ensure imaging technology is developed and used&#xD;
      effectively. Evaluation of the clinical and economic impact of such imaging lags behind the&#xD;
      technology development. Heart failure (HF)represents the final common pathway for most forms&#xD;
      of heart disease and morbidity and mortality remain high. There is a need to identify imaging&#xD;
      approaches that have a positive impact on therapy decisions, patient outcomes and costs. As&#xD;
      well as standard methods to evaluate new and emerging techniques to better test their&#xD;
      potential in a clinical management setting. The OVERALL OBJECTIVES of the IMAGE-HF trial are&#xD;
      1) to determine the impact of emerging imaging strategies, on relevant clinical outcomes and&#xD;
      decision making in patients with HF; 2) to establish standardization quality assurance (QA)&#xD;
      measures and central databases in order to achieve reliable outcome driven research; 3) to&#xD;
      apply this as a platform for evaluation of new and emerging imaging biomarkers in HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project I-A: The PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF AIMI-HF is to compare the effect of HF imaging&#xD;
      strategies on the composite clinical endpoint of cardiac death, MI, resuscitated cardiac&#xD;
      arrest and cardiac re-hospitalization (WHF, ACS, arrhythmia). Patients with an ischemic heart&#xD;
      disease (IHD) etiology will follow HF imaging strategy algorithms according to the&#xD;
      question(s) asked by the physicians (is there ischemia and/or viability), in agreement with&#xD;
      their local practices for standard and alternative imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of AIMI-HF To compare the effect of HF imaging strategies on&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The incidence of revascularization procedures (PCI, CABG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. LV remodeling: LV volumes, LVEF&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. HF symptoms, NYHA class&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. QOL (MLHFQ, the EQ5D)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The evolution of serum prognostic markers in HF (e.g. BNP, RDW, hs-cTnT, hs-CRP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Health economics: Costs estimated through regression analysis and cost effectiveness&#xD;
           assessed through decision modeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The safety of imaging tests measured by cumulative radiation, adverse reactions to&#xD;
           imaging contrast agents and stress testing agents will also be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The evolution of renal function (eGFR) and LV remodeling-associated biomarkers (e.g.&#xD;
           PIIINP, OPN).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among patients with coronary artery disease and HF, mortality rates range from 10-60% at 1&#xD;
      year. Many trials have demonstrated benefit of revascularization in patients with ischemic&#xD;
      heart disease (IHD) and LV dysfunction. Some criteria, such as severe angina or left main&#xD;
      coronary artery stenosis may indicate the need for surgical therapy for HF patients; however,&#xD;
      a large number of patients fall into a gray zone without clear evidence for benefit from&#xD;
      surgical intervention. The need remains for approaches that can help better define and select&#xD;
      the HF patients most likely to benefit from revascularization; which could be either surgical&#xD;
      or percutaneous intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increasingly over the past three decades, information describing cardiac structure,&#xD;
      perfusion, hemodynamics, and metabolism obtained from noninvasive cardiac imaging studies has&#xD;
      been used to guide management decisions for patients with HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMI-HF is part of a large Canadian team grant IMAGE-HF (Imaging Modalities to Assist with&#xD;
      Guiding therapy and the Evaluation of patients with Heart Failure) involving 3 parallel&#xD;
      randomized trials addressing the role of imaging in HF patients according to HF etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis of AIMI-HF:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with HF due to IHD with LVEF less than or equal to 45%, a management algorithm&#xD;
      that applies alternative imaging strategies (PET or CMR) achieves a better clinical outcome&#xD;
      measured as the composite clinical endpoint (CCE) of cardiac death, MI, resuscitated cardiac&#xD;
      arrest and cardiac re-hospitalization (WHF, ACS, arrhythmia) than an approach with &quot;standard&#xD;
      care&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypotheses of AIMI-HF:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Compared to standard care, in patients with HF due to IHD with LVEF ≤ 45%, a management&#xD;
      algorithm that applies alternative imaging modalities (PET or CMR) achieves: a) more&#xD;
      efficient use of revascularization procedures with similar complication rates than standard&#xD;
      care imaging strategies b) better LV remodeling (including favorable evolution of serum&#xD;
      markers associated with LV remodeling e.g. PIIINP, OPN) c) better HF and angina symptom&#xD;
      reduction, d) better QoL, measured using MLHFQ and EQ5D, e) more favorable evolution of&#xD;
      selected serum markers of prognosis in HF (e.g. BNP, RDW, hs-cTnT, hs-CRP) and f) is&#xD;
      economically attractive in patients with HF due to IHD with LVEF&lt;45%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) In patients with HF due to IHD with LVEF ≤ 45%, a HF management algorithm that applies&#xD;
      PET achieves a better primary composite clinical endpoint (CCE) and secondary outcomes&#xD;
      (revascularizations, remodeling, QoL, Cost efficiency) compared to one that applies CMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii) Renal function impairment is a known independent predictor of cardiovascular events in&#xD;
      HF. Renal function may influence revascularisation decisions and its evolution could be&#xD;
      modified by revascularisation procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMI-HF is the IMAGE-HF Project 1-A trial; it is a prospective comparative effectiveness&#xD;
      study to compare the effect of HF imaging strategies in patients with HF due to IHD. Eligible&#xD;
      patients will have LV systolic dysfunction due to IHD where evaluation of ischemia and&#xD;
      viability is relevant. Patients will be prospectively randomized to standard (SPECT) versus&#xD;
      advanced (PET or CMR) imaging. Patients who meet inclusion criteria but cannot be randomized&#xD;
      due to clinical management decisions, yet undergo standard or advanced imaging (SPECT, PET/CT&#xD;
      or CMR), will be entered into a registry. Based on site screening logs, patients who could&#xD;
      not be randomized, who met all other inclusion criteria and underwent standard or advanced&#xD;
      imaging, will be retrospectively enrolled, from the date of original HREB approval, into the&#xD;
      study as registry participants. Registry recruitment will be monitored to ensure a balanced&#xD;
      recruitment for each modality registry.&#xD;

    <description>For the primary analysis, the time-to-event of the composite clinical endpoint of cardiac death, MI, arrest and cardiac re-hospitalization&#xD;
(WHF, ACS, arrhythmia) will be compared between the advanced modality (PET or CMR) to an approach with standard care using SPECT imaging using survival analysis. Kaplan-Meier survival curves of the primary endpoint will be compared between the advanced and standard modalities with the log-rank test. In addition for the primary hypothesis, a SPECT registry will be considered in order to make the allocation between the advanced and standard modalities 1:1.</description>
