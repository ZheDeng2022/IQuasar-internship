      This study will compare the absolute and relative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of&#xD;
      asthma management in patients in the USA on inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) maintenance therapy&#xD;
      as HFA-BDP (Qvar®) pressurised metered dose inhaler (pMDI) compared with fluticasone&#xD;
      propionate (FP) pMDI. .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current asthma guidelines are underpinned by evidence derived from randomised controlled&#xD;
      trials (RCTs). Although RCT data are considered the gold standard, patients recruited to&#xD;
      asthma RCTs are estimated to represent only a small percentage of the real-world asthma&#xD;
      population. The poor representation of the asthma population is due to a number of factors,&#xD;
      such as tightly-controlled inclusion criteria for RCTs. There is, therefore, a need to carry&#xD;
      out real-world observational studies to inform existing guidelines on the effectiveness of&#xD;
      available treatments as used in every-day clinical practice in the heterogeneous asthma&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma management guidelines recommend long-term, daily anti-inflammatory controller therapy&#xD;
      to attenuate the chronic airway inflammation of persistent asthma. The choice of inhaled&#xD;
      corticosteroid can be guided by practical considerations (e.g., cost factors) as RCTs have so&#xD;
      far failed to identify consistent, significant differences in outcomes among the available&#xD;
      inhaled corticosteroids, and data from observational studies are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FP and HFA-BDP are the two main ICS therapies prescribed in the US for the management of&#xD;
      asthma. FP is approximately twice as potent and efficacious, on a microgram basis, as BDP. In&#xD;
      clinical trials, however, the extra-fine hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) formulation of BDP has&#xD;
      demonstrated potency similar to that of FP. This is felt to be because HFA-BDP shows higher&#xD;
      and more even lung deposition than FP, with HFA-BDP, unlike FP, having distribution to both&#xD;
      large and small airways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Owing to similarity of effectiveness of extra-fine HFA-BDP and FP suggested by clinical trial&#xD;
      data, and the even lung distribution afforded by the smaller HFA aerosol particles, we&#xD;
      hypothesises that extra-fine HFA-BDP may be at least as effective as FP in real-world&#xD;
      clinical practice. This hypothesis was supported by a retrospective database study of HFA-BDP&#xD;
      versus FP using the UK's General Practice Research Database (GPRD). The study found&#xD;
      significantly lower odds for achieving the composite proxy measure for asthma control with FP&#xD;
      in both patients initiating ICS therapy (0.77, 95%CI 0.61-0.98) and stepping-up ICS therapy&#xD;
      (0.82, 95%CI 0.44-1.52) relative to HFA-BDP. The analysis also revealed that FP was&#xD;
      prescribed at significantly higher doses than extra-fine HFA-BDP yet had lower associated&#xD;
      odds of achieving asthma control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to significant health benefits, delivering effective asthma control is critical&#xD;
      to reducing the substantial economic burden of asthma, with research indicating annual costs&#xD;
      are disproportionately attributable to patients with poorly controlled disease. Recent&#xD;
      estimates place the annual figure at 56 billion dollars ($) in the US alone, consisting of&#xD;
      direct costs and productivity losses.It is therefore of particular importance to consider&#xD;
      outcomes achieved in relation to costs incurred when assessing overall benefit of asthma&#xD;
      therapies, with a cost-effectiveness analysis of HFA BDP and FP planned as part of the&#xD;
      current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the absolute and relative effectiveness and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of asthma management in patients in the US on inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)&#xD;
      maintenance therapy as extra-fine HFA-BDP (Qvar®) pressurised metered dose inhaler (pMDI)&#xD;
      compared with fluticasone propionate (FP) pMDI to further examine the findings of the UK&#xD;
      study, and to identify similarities or differences in effectiveness and cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      outcomes and prescribing practice between the two countries.&#xD;

Differences in costs and proportions of patients controlled will be displayed graphically on a cost-effectiveness plane. The four quadrants of the cost-effectiveness plane represent QVAR being:&#xD;
Quadrant I: more costly and more effective (a trade-off);&#xD;
Quadrant II: more costly and less effective (FP dominant);&#xD;
Quadrant III: less costly and less effective (a trade-off); and&#xD;
Quadrant IV: less costly and more effective (QVAR dominant)&#xD;
Where the point estimates indicate 'trade-off' between treatments, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio will be calculated:ICER = cQVAR - cFP/eQVAR - eFP (cQVAR and eQVAR are the cost and effectiveness of QVAR respectively and CFP and EFP are the cost and effectiveness of FP).</description>
