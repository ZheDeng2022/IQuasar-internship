    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of lapatinib ditosylate and Akt&#xD;
      inhibitor MK2206 in treating women with metastatic breast cancer. Lapatinib ditosylate and&#xD;
      Akt inhibitor MK2206 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of continuous daily administration of lapatinib&#xD;
      (lapatinib ditosylate) in combination with weekly administration of MK2206 (AKT inhibitor&#xD;
      MK2206) in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive advanced&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and identify the maximum-tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for this administration schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of MK2206 and lapatinib, each given alone and in&#xD;
      the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate potential pharmacogenetic influence of the candidate drug metabolizing&#xD;
      enzymes and transporters on the PK of MK2206 and lapatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the change in select breast cancer biomarkers in the phosphatase and tensin&#xD;
      homolog (PTEN)/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt-signaling pathways, (e.g.,&#xD;
      phosphorylated [p]PTEN, PTEN, pAkt, Akt, phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase&#xD;
      (pGSK)3-beta, GSK3-beta), Wnt/beta-catenin pathway (e.g., activated beta-catenin (ABC),&#xD;
      beta-catenin), and pHER2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the change in breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) biomarkers, aldehyde&#xD;
      dehydrogenase (ALDH)1 and cluster of differentiation (CD) 44+/CD24-, before and after 2 weeks&#xD;
      of treatment with the combination of MK2206 and lapatinib at the MTD. The percent change in&#xD;
      BCSCs in tumor biopsies will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine tumor response in patients with measurable disease as assessed by the&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), and by percent change in BCSCs within&#xD;
      the tumor before vs after 2 weeks of combination treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To perform genomic profiling of the tumor cell and BCSC populations before and after 2&#xD;
      weeks of treatment with the combination of MK2206 and lapatinib at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by an expansion cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive lapatinib ditosylate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1 and 15-28 of&#xD;
      course 1 and on days 1-28 of subsequent courses. Patients also receive AKT inhibitor MK2206&#xD;
      PO QD on days 8, 15, and 22 of course 1 and on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of subsequent courses.&#xD;
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;

             study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not receive any other anti-cancer therapy (cytotoxic, biologic,&#xD;
             radiation, or hormonal other than for replacement) while on this study except for&#xD;
             medications that are prescribed for supportive care but may potentially have an&#xD;
             anti-cancer effect (i.e. megestrol acetate, bisphosphonates); these medications must&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Preclinical studies indicated transient changes in corrected QT (QTc) interval during&#xD;
             MK-2206 treatment; prolongation of QTc interval is potentially a safety concern while&#xD;

             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding should be discontinued if&#xD;
             the mother is treated with MK-2206; these potential risks may also apply to other&#xD;
             agents used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with malabsorption syndrome or other condition that would interfere with&#xD;
             intestinal absorption; patients must be able to swallow tablets&#xD;

             serial biopsies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Due to a high incidence of bradycardia observed in early trials of MK-2206, patients&#xD;
             with significant bundle branch block, or bradycardia related to cardiac disease,&#xD;
