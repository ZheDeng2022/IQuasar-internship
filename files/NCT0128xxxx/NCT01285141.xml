  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A vaccine to prevent infection with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is urgently&#xD;
      needed. Worldwide, most HIV infections occur through sex between a man and woman. The vaccine&#xD;
      in this study consists of a protein from HIV that has been synthetically produced and linked&#xD;
      to a protein that boosts immune responses. It has not been tested in humans before, but it is&#xD;
      expected (from animal studies) that direct application into the female genital tract (via the&#xD;
      vagina) as liquid drops, will provoke immune protection at the site of HIV infection. This is&#xD;
      less applicable to men, therefore only healthy, HIV negative women will be recruited. The&#xD;
      investigators will recruit at one site, which is a university vaccine research centre with&#xD;
      experience of running similar trials. The study will last 24 weeks during which subjects will&#xD;
      have blood samples taken on six visits, and three immunisations over 12 weeks in which 1&#xD;
      millilitres of vaccine is placed into the vaginal by inserting a small plastic syringe. The&#xD;
      purpose of this initial small study is to monitor safety of the vaccine and to determine&#xD;
      whether it is appropriate to continue into future, larger studies in which the immune&#xD;
      response to the vaccine is measured.&#xD;

      This hypothesis-generating, first-in-human, Phase 1 study will be conducted according to the&#xD;
      Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) of St George's. The purpose of the study is to determine&#xD;
      the immediate safety and reactogenicity of the vaccine, to guide future larger Phase 1/2&#xD;
      studies of safety and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eight subjects will be included to receive 3 cervico-vaginal topical applications of 100Âµg of&#xD;
      CN54gp140-hsp70 conjugate vaccine in 1.0 mL physiological buffer, administered as topical&#xD;
      intra-vaginal drops on day 0, and at 4 and 12 weeks after the first immunisation. The study&#xD;
      will consist of 1 pre-study screening visit, 3 immunisation visits, and 2 follow-up visits&#xD;
      over a total period of 20 weeks. Subjects will be recruited as one cohort in two groups of&#xD;
      four. The dose of antigens and immunisation schedule has been selected based on pre-clinical&#xD;
      and clinical experience with the same HIV envelope protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject's medical history (including past and present illnesses, current medications,&#xD;
      family medical history) will be formally assessed and recorded at screening. Volunteers' age,&#xD;
      gender, height, weight and ethnic origin will be recorded. A full physical examination will&#xD;
      be conducted by a registered medical practitioner at screening and the final study visit.&#xD;
      Regular assessments of vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, temperature) will be made on all&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diary cards, investigator-prompted recall of events, laboratory tests (haematology,&#xD;
      biochemistry) and direct visualisation of immunisation site will be used to identify Adverse&#xD;
      Events. Frequency of vaccine-related Adverse Events is the Primary Study Endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and after each immunisation visit (0, 4 and 12 weeks) blood samples will be obtained&#xD;
      for collection of serum and for separation of PBMCs for cellular assays. At each time point,&#xD;
      vaginal and cervical secretions will be taken. All immunology assays are exploratory and are&#xD;
      not study endpoints. HIV serology and DNA detection will be repeated at the final visit to&#xD;
      detect subjects who may have contracted HIV infection during the study period, and who may&#xD;
      therefore have developed antibody and T-cell responses due to the HIV infection that would&#xD;
      interfere with exploratory immunology assays.&#xD;
