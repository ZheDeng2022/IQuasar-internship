  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Most psychotropic medications that are effective in the treatment of Bipolar&#xD;
      Disorder (BD) are associated with endocrine-metabolic changes (EMCs). To date, there is no&#xD;
      long-term study in BD that has examined specifically the association of inflammation with&#xD;
      EMCs in BD. Specific aims: 1) to identify predictors of EMCs among adolescents and adults&#xD;
      with BD who are being started on a medication ; 2) to compare change in EMCs in youth and&#xD;
      adults treated for BD; 3) to measure change in EMCs associated with use of different&#xD;
      medications for BD. Research Design: Participants: 30 adolescents (14-18 years old) with BD&#xD;
      and 30 adults (19-65 years old) with BD. Measures: Blood levels of biomarkers that are&#xD;
      associated with EMCs will be measured.&#xD;

        Thirty adolescent participants with BD (type I, II, or not otherwise specified), and 30&#xD;
        adult participants with BD will be enrolled. Participants with BD will be recruited from&#xD;
        the Youth and Adult Mood Disorder Clinics. Psychiatry Division staff will identify patients&#xD;
        who meet the study criteria during weekly treatment team meetings. New referrals will also&#xD;
        be screened to identify potential participants.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Provision of written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diagnosis of BD type I, II, or NOS as determined by DSM-IV diagnostic criteria&#xD;
             (confirmed using SCID or K-SADS)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Both females and males, age14 to 65 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Decision by physician and patient to initiate pharmacotherapy with a traditional mood&#xD;
             stabilizer or atypical antipsychotic&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Able to understand and comply with requirements of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Proficient in English.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A primary psychiatric disorder other than bipolar disorder I, II or NOS (comorbid Axis&#xD;
             I or II disorders are permitted, as long as clinician judges that bipolar disorder is&#xD;
             the primary condition)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Initiation of an antipsychotic, mood stabilizer or other medication with known&#xD;
             endocrine-metabolic effects within 4 weeks prior to baseline visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who, in the investigators opinion, are unlikely to adhere to pharmacotherapy&#xD;
             for at least 4 weeks after baseline visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Significant medical condition that would contraindicate the use of mood stabilizers or&#xD;
             atypical antipsychotics&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients who are receiving pharmacological treatment for diabetes mellitus (DM),&#xD;
             hyperlipidemia, or obesity&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Acute or chronic medical illness (e.g. urinary tract infection, bronchitis, rheumatoid&#xD;
             arthritis) that, as judged by the investigator, would significantly alter&#xD;
             inflammatory, metabolic, or endocrine indices&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Screening bloodwork that identifies any other clinically significant deviation from&#xD;
             the reference range in clinical laboratory test results, as judged by the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
