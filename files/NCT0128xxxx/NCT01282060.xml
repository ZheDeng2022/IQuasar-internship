      The purpose of this study is to asses the link between glycaemic balance (summarised by HBA1C&#xD;
      LEVEL) and specific causes of death.&#xD;

      The GERODIAB study is the first prospective, longitudinal follow-up cohort study, the main&#xD;
      aim of which is to assess the link between glycaemic balance (evaluated on the basis of HbA1c&#xD;
      levels) and total mortality at 5 years in diabetic patients aged 70 and over, and suffering&#xD;
      from type 2 diabetes. An extension to 10 years is considered given the innovative features of&#xD;
      this cohort follow-up procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the link between glycaemic balance and the mortality rate with specific&#xD;
           causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the link between glycaemic balance and the onset of or change in&#xD;
           diabetes-related complications: cardiovascular diseases, change in renal function,&#xD;
           diabetic retinopathy, peripheral neuropathy, perforating ulcer of the foot and acute&#xD;
           metabolic complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the link between glycaemic balance and nutritional status, the onset of or&#xD;
           changes in cognitive disorders and a loss of autonomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To specify the role of other cardiovascular risk factors combined with glycaemic&#xD;
           balance, in mortality, diabetes-related complications, cognitive disorders and loss of&#xD;
           autonomy.&#xD;
