      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine is working to improve physicians'&#xD;
      understanding of brain injury. More information is needed on traumatic brain injury (TBI),&#xD;
      especially how well a person recovers from TBI and how the brain changes over time in people&#xD;
      with TBI. To conduct this research, the center is sponsoring a number of research studies on&#xD;
      TBI and is interested in evaluating individuals with TBI or post-concussive syndrome to&#xD;
      determine if they might be eligible for future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To develop a pool of individuals with traumatic brain injury and post-concussive syndrome&#xD;
      for future research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have symptoms of or have been diagnosed with&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury or post-concussive syndrome and are willing to participate in future&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with an initial telephone interview, and will be asked to&#xD;
           come to the National Institutes of Health for an in-person screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the screening visit, participants will provide a medical history, have a physical&#xD;
           examination and complete a study questionnaire on their TBI and its symptoms, including&#xD;
           how the injury occurred, when it occurred, and any previous brain-related injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects may also return for a second visit at the NIH CC if eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each visit may involve blood samples, an MRI scan, and a series of tests to evaluate&#xD;
           brain function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will also provide contact information to enable researchers to contact them&#xD;
           for future studies....&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      This screening and registry protocol is designed to facilitate subject recruitment for the&#xD;
      Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine (CNRM) sponsored clinical research studies&#xD;
      on traumatic brain injury (TBI) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and participating&#xD;
      CNRM sites. This protocol will serve as a first step for evaluating subjects for possible&#xD;
      inclusion in CNRM sponsored natural history, observational, or interventional protocols.&#xD;
      Other approved CNRM protocols may continue to recruit subjects directly into their respective&#xD;
      studies, and may refer subjects to this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this protocol is to develop a subject recruitment database that will house&#xD;
      preliminary data on research subjects who are interested in and potentially eligible for&#xD;
      current and future CNRM sponsored protocols. The effectiveness of the recruitment methods&#xD;
      utilized in this protocol will be evaluated to determine the most successful outreach&#xD;
      approaches and recruitment tools for the enrollment of TBI or post concussive study subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol will enroll 2500 male and female adult subjects with signs/symptoms or&#xD;
      diagnosis of TBI or post-concussive syndrome, from participating sites, other CNRM sponsored&#xD;
      protocols and within the community using various methods of outreach and advertisement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves an initial study visit conducted in one of two ways: at the NIH Clinical&#xD;
      Center,or at the participating site. Subjects enrolled acutely and/or at a participating site&#xD;
      may also be provided the option to complete an additional visit at the NIH CC after their&#xD;
      initial visit. Based on the information obtained during the initial study visit, the subject&#xD;
      will be referred to appropriate CNRM protocols for further protocol-specific screening prior&#xD;
      to enrollment, or informed that s/he is not eligible for any other actively enrolling CNRM&#xD;
      studies at this time. Study procedures may include: physical exam, medical history, nursing&#xD;
      evaluation, questionnaires completed by interview, blood and urine sample collection, and&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits will be conducted by telephone at regular intervals for a year, and then ad&#xD;
      hoc at potential referral eligibility to update contact information and collect outcome data.&#xD;
      No treatment is offered under this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome measures include accrual of subjects, retention of enrolled subjects and loss to&#xD;
      follow-up, and referral number and rate of enrolled subjects to other CNRM studies. In&#xD;
      addition, we will evaluate the frequency and certainty of injury classification (possible,&#xD;
      probable, or definite TBI).&#xD;

        Enrollment in this protocol will occur at a participating site MedStar Washington Hospital&#xD;
        Center (WHC) or Johns Hopkins Suburban Hospital (Suburban), or at the NIH Clinical Center&#xD;
        (NIH CC). Applicable study procedures will depend on the visit site, diagnostic certainty,&#xD;
        and logistic considerations such as distance from NIH and feasibility of transport. All&#xD;
        subjects will undergo a study visit at a participating enrollment site and/or the NIH&#xD;
        Clinical Center. Subjects enrolled acutely at the NIH CC may undergo an additional study&#xD;
        visit at the NIH. Phone follow-up will occur at 6-months, 1 year from initial consent.&#xD;
        Additional subject follow-up contact will be made should @@@a subject become eligible for&#xD;
        referral to another eligible protocol.@@@&#xD;
