    <textblock>
      Over the past five years, a spectrum of studies has shown that the stromal cell populations&#xD;
      surrounding or embedding cancer cells in a variety of different tumor types are intrinsically&#xD;
      involved in the mechanisms affecting tumor growth and metastasis. Among these cells,&#xD;
      fibroblasts and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) have been shown to play key roles in&#xD;
      the regulation of tumor cell behaviors, via differential gene expression, regulation and&#xD;
      secretion of specific chemokines (e.g., RANTES, CXCL12 and CXCL14), cytokines (e.g., TNF-α,&#xD;
      IL-1β, NF-κB) and control by inflammatory and immunomodulatory cells, molecules or potent&#xD;
      growth factors. Of particular interest is that the various stromal immune cells (dendritic&#xD;
      cells and T cells) and inflammatory MDSCs found in primary and metastatic tumors behave very&#xD;
      differently from those present in normal or non-cancerous counterpart tissues. In light of&#xD;
      these &quot;new understandings&quot; in cancer biology, the investigators believe that systematic and&#xD;
      innovative approaches to further research are very much needed in Taiwan and at our Academy.&#xD;
      Here the investigators propose to investigate the tumor suppressive effect of&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory phytomedicines on regulation of stromal immune cells and fibroblasts in&#xD;
      breast cancers. The investigators will employ the TS/A and 4T1 mouse mammary carcinoma system&#xD;
      to conduct an in vivo study of several specific candidate phytomedicines (cytopiloyne,&#xD;
      Wedelia chinensis, shikonin, emodin and others that the investigators have already identified&#xD;
      as conferring anti-inflammation related activities) for inhibition of TS/A and 4T1 tumor&#xD;
      growth and specific effects on inflammation-associated, cellular and molecular functions of&#xD;
      stromal immune cells, fibroblasts and MDSCs. When potent and specific anti-tumor effects are&#xD;
      detected, the investigators will extend our study to a three-dimensional collagen/Matrigel&#xD;
      culture system for ex-vivo study focusing on the stromal cell-mediated or -associated&#xD;
      anti-tumor effects of TS/A or 4T1 cells, using the &quot;organoid&quot; tissue culture systems the&#xD;
      investigators have previously developed in our laboratory (JNCI, 1979; Cancer Res., 1981).&#xD;
      The investigators will establish reconstituted TS/A or 4T1 tumor cells with the stromal&#xD;
      immune cells in a co-cultivation system. When the investigators have achieved demonstrable&#xD;
      success, the investigators will extend the mouse system to human breast cancers (including&#xD;
      primary and metastatic tumors) by a close collaboration (which the investigators have already&#xD;
      established) with Drs.&#xD;

      Ji-Hong Jhu (朱紀洪, Hospital President, M.D./surgeon) and Huey-Kong Sytwu (司徒惠康, M.D., Ph.D.)&#xD;
      at the National Defense University Hospital. The investigators will then study the molecular&#xD;
      signaling effect of specific phytocompounds already identified to confer in vivo (mouse),&#xD;
      anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory activities, in primary/organoid cultures of human breast&#xD;
      tumor cells under ex vivo conditions. Finally, the investigators intend to identify the key&#xD;
      molecular regulators, immune-modulatory effectors of test stromal immune cells that are&#xD;
      affected by the candidate phytomedicines, using molecular and cell biology assays to&#xD;
      investigate the interplay between immune cells and tumor cells in the stromal tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study is expected to reveal one or more highly specific, anti-inflammatory phytocompounds&#xD;
      that mechanistically confer specific effects on stromal fibroblast or immune cell types,&#xD;
      resulting in potent anti-tumor effects on test mammary carcinoma systems. Five Specific Aims&#xD;
      are thus designed to investigate the immuno-modulating effects of specific medicinal&#xD;
      constituents from TCM materials. The experimental findings obtained from this study would&#xD;
      provide insights in the molecular, cellular and signaling mechanisms/effects of several&#xD;
      medicinal phytocompounds that may have potential applications in chemoprevention or herbal&#xD;
      medicine adjuvant treatment of human breast cancers.&#xD;
