      Melanoma is the most aggressive skin cancer, with a propensity to metastasize, and is&#xD;
      resistant to most of the current therapeutic regimens. Incidence rate of melanoma in patients&#xD;
      with MDM (Mal De Maleda, with SLURP-1 mutation) is much higher than normal counterpart.&#xD;
      SLURP-1 (lymphocyte antigen 6/urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor related&#xD;
      protein-1) is an allosteric agonist to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR) and it&#xD;
      regulates epidermal homeostasis and T-cell function. The preliminary results of comparing&#xD;
      human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 4 affected and 15 unaffected members&#xD;
      from the family with MDM revealed that T-cell activation was impaired in PBMCs with the&#xD;
      heterozygous and homozygous SLURP-1 G86R mutation. (2 of affected members developed&#xD;
      melanoma.) Since there is currently no effective treatment for metastatic melanoma,&#xD;
      identifying novel molecular mechanisms may lead to development of new treatments for&#xD;
      metastatic melanomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous study showed that melanoma stem cells (MSCs) are crucial in melanoma pathogenesis:&#xD;
      1.Melanoma contains ABCB5, CD133 and ABCG2 positive cells had enhanced tumorigenic potential.&#xD;
      2.Higher frequencies of cells capable of initiating melanoma xenografts when using IL2Rγ-/-&#xD;
      NOD SCID mice. These data confirmed the interaction between T cells and MSCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, we will investigate the roles of SLURP-1 in melanoma and MSCs. Investigating&#xD;
      and verifying the interaction between T-cells from patients with MDM and melanoma cells to&#xD;
      confirm the SLURP-1 function of tumorigenesis in xenotransplant mice (IL2Rγ-/- NOD SCID)&#xD;
      model. To reveal the role of SLURP-1 silencing in melanoma cell lines by using not only A2058&#xD;
      , A375 and MeWo mwlanima cell lines but also ABCB5+ melanoma cells and ABCB5- melanoma cells&#xD;
      through the tumorigenesis, apoptosis,angiogenesis, proliferation, melanosphere formation&#xD;
      assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to investigate the roles and molecular mechanisms of SLURP-1 in&#xD;
      melanoma carcinogenesis, which may improve the development of novel treatments for melanoma.&#xD;

      Cutaneous melanoma is an aggressive neoplasm refractory to traditional therapies, especially&#xD;
      at the metastatic stage. Furthermore, its incidence is continuously increasing during the&#xD;
      last decade (1). Melanomas develop through a multistep process that from normal melanocytes&#xD;
      proceeds to nevi and to radial and vertical growth phase tumors (2). During this process,&#xD;
      melanomas are characterized by certain well-defined genetic alterations as well as frequent&#xD;
      chromosomal aberrations associated with tumor progression (3). However, the molecular&#xD;
      mechanisms involved in the carcinogenesis and progression of melanoma are complex and not&#xD;
      entirely clear (4). Because of the intractability of metastatic melanomas with only 14% of&#xD;
      the patients survive for 5 years and no effective treatments (2), understanding the&#xD;
      underlying molecular mechanisms involved in melanoma and identifying molecular markers may&#xD;
      lead to improvements in therapeutic approaches for metastatic melanomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mal de Meleda (MDM; OMIM 248300) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by&#xD;
      erythema and hyperkeratosis of the palms and soles, extending to the dorsal aspects of the&#xD;
      hands and feet (known as transgrediens), and perioral erythema and psoriasiform plaques on&#xD;
      the elbows and knees. (5-7) Homozygous mutations of the SLURP1 gene (previously known as ARS&#xD;
      component B) encoding lymphocyte antigen 6/urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor&#xD;
      related protein-1 (SLURP-1) have been identified as the cause of MDM. (8-10) Mutations of the&#xD;
      SLURP1 gene affect the expression, integrity and stability of SLURP-1 on the upper layer of&#xD;
      the epidermis and in cultured mature keratinocytes. (11) Other studies also demonstrated that&#xD;
      SLURP-1 acts as a positive allosteric ligand for 7-nAchR in keratinocytes, eliciting&#xD;
      proapoptotic activity and differentiation. (12,13) As well as in epidermis and keratinocytes,&#xD;
      the expression of SLURP-1 has been found in T cells, B cells, dendritic cells and&#xD;
      macrophages. (14-15) Malignant melanoma (MM) has been reported to be the predominant&#xD;
      cutaneous malignancy occurring in the hyperkeratotic area in patients with MDM. (16) The&#xD;
      incidence of MM in MDM is significantly higher than in the general population.(17) At least&#xD;
      six cases of MM have been reported in patients with MDM;27-29 two of the reported cases were&#xD;
      siblings. (18) The possible explanations of the higher incidence of MM in patients with MDM&#xD;
      include: (i) lack of proapoptotic effect of SLURP-1; (ii) defective T-cell activation and&#xD;
      tumour monitoring; or (iii) prolonged inflammation in hyperkeratotic skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The previous study showed that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with the&#xD;
      heterozygous and homozygous SLURP-1 G86R mutation had defective T-cell activation. This was&#xD;
      restored by the addition of 0•5 μg mL-1 recombinant human SLURP-1 protein. (19) Previous&#xD;
      study showed that a putative monoclonal antibody that recognized ABCB5 was used to isolate&#xD;
      melanoma stem cells (MSCs). (20) In this study, the investigators will investigate the roles&#xD;
      of SLURP-1 in melanoma cells (including MSC) and also its interaction between melanoma cells&#xD;
      and T-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims：&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the significance and correlation of SLURP-1 expression in melanoma cells and&#xD;
           melanoma metastasis in human tissues and mouse metastasis models.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the function of the SLURP-1 protein in melanoma cells and melanoma stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate the interaction between T-cells with SLURP-1 mutation and melanoma cells&#xD;
           / MSCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Confirm the biological effects of SLURP-1 on melanoma cells / MSCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To investigate the relationship between SLURP-1 overexpression and melanoma cancer&#xD;
           biology.&#xD;
