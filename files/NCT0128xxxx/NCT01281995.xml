      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Corticosteroids have been used to treat inflammation and immune system diseases for&#xD;
      decades. However, despite their widespread use, there is little information on the specifics&#xD;
      of how corticosteroids affect the immune system in humans. The Center for Human Immunology,&#xD;
      Autoimmunity, and Inflammatory Diseases is interested in studying how the steroid hormone&#xD;
      hydrocortisone affects the immune system in healthy volunteers, and in doing so to understand&#xD;
      how hydrocortisone given at different doses works in treating many immune and inflammatory&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate the effects of hydrocortisone on the immune and inflammatory responses of&#xD;
      healthy volunteers over the short and intermediate term (up to 28 days after administration).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy volunteers at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a full medical history and physical examination, and&#xD;
           blood and urine tests. At this visit, participants will be separated into two groups,&#xD;
           with each group scheduled to receive a different amount of hydrocortisone during the&#xD;
           study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One week before the study visit, participants will provide a blood sample for baseline&#xD;
           testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be admitted for a 24-hour inpatient stay that will involve frequent&#xD;
           blood draws. Between blood draws, participants will be able to work, watch TV, walk&#xD;
           around, and so on, and will be provided with regular meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood will be drawn 1 hour before the infusion of hydrocortisone. Participants will be&#xD;
           divided into two further sets of groups with different blood draw schedules:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Groups 1 (lower dose) and 2 (higher dose) will have blood draws 1, 4, 8, 12, and 24&#xD;
           hours after the hydrocortisone infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Groups 3 (lower dose) and 4 (higher dose) will have multiple blood draws over 24 hours,&#xD;
           with timing based on data from the previous groups blood test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide additional blood samples 7 and 28 days after the in-patient&#xD;
           visit....&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Corticosteroids have been in widespread therapeutic use as anti-inflammatory and&#xD;
      immunomodulatory agents for decades, and there is a wealth of information on their&#xD;
      immunosuppressive effects in animals and in human cells cultured in vitro. However, despite&#xD;
      their ubiquitous clinical use, there is a paucity of information on the effects of&#xD;
      corticosteroids administered to humans systemically, and no previous study has examined their&#xD;
      effects on the human immunome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the Center for Human Immunology, Autoimmunity, and Inflammatory Diseases proposes&#xD;
      this protocol designed to obtain blood from healthy adult subjects at baseline, and then at&#xD;
      various time points after administration of 250 mg and 50 mg of intravenous hydrocortisone.&#xD;
      These samples will be used to perform a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the immune&#xD;
      system in response to corticosteroid administration. To our knowledge, this protocol will be&#xD;
      the first study to characterize the human cellular and molecular immune system parameters, or&#xD;
      immunome, in healthy adult subjects after administration of corticosteroids. This information&#xD;
      may be useful in understanding the mechanistic effects of this commonly prescribed class of&#xD;
      medications in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to perform laboratory studies to characterize the immune response in&#xD;
      healthy adult volunteers after administration of moderate (250 mg) and low (50 mg) doses of&#xD;
      the glucocorticoid hydrocortisone. Primary endpoint is the results of the research laboratory&#xD;
      assessments. As samples will be stored indefinitely, the time frame for primary endpoint is&#xD;
      indefinite.&#xD;
