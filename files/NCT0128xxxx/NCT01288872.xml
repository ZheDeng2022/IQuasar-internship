  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to understand whether the drug praziquantel (PZQ) is metabolized&#xD;
      or broken down differently when women are pregnant versus not pregnant. PZQ is used to treat&#xD;
      schistosomiasis (worm infection). Researchers will study how PZQ is broken down among 15&#xD;
      women who are 12-16 weeks pregnant, 15 women who are 30-36 weeks pregnant, and 15 women&#xD;
      nonpregnant women who are producing breast milk. All women will be 18 or older and otherwise&#xD;
      healthy. The usual practice is to wait until after mothers have finished pregnancy and breast&#xD;
      feeding before giving PZQ. Participants will receive 2 doses of PZQ separated by 3 hours.&#xD;
      Study procedures will include a 24 hour hospital stay following administration of PZQ, blood,&#xD;
      stool and urine samples, ultrasound if pregnant, and physical exams of mother and baby.&#xD;
      Patient participation for mother/infant pair is about 9 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schistosomiasis infects over 200 million individuals and remains a significant cause of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality in developing countries, despite the availability of effective&#xD;
      pharmacologic therapy with praziquantel (PZQ). Researchers propose to conduct a phase I study&#xD;
      of the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of PZQ for the treatment of Schistosomiasis (S.)&#xD;
      japonicum among pregnant and lactating women living in the province of Leyte, The&#xD;
      Philippines. In practice, treatment of schistosomiasis is withheld for both pregnant and&#xD;
      lactating post partum women in the Philippines as well as other countries endemic for&#xD;
      schistosomiasis. Without treatment, these women accrue known morbidities identified among&#xD;
      non-pregnant subjects including hepatic fibrosis, under-nutrition, and anemia. The overall&#xD;
      aims of this study are to see if there are differences in PZQ PK and safety during pregnancy&#xD;
      compared to post partum, to describe the kinetics of breast milk transfer of PZQ and to&#xD;
      estimate the dose of PZQ received by a nursing infant whose mother is treated with PZQ. This&#xD;
      protocol will enroll 15 pregnant women in early pregnancy (12-16 weeks gestation), 15&#xD;
      pregnant women in late pregnancy (30-36 weeks gestation) and 15 lactating nonpregnant women&#xD;
      between 5 and 7 months postpartum. The study population will consist of S. japonicum infected&#xD;
      women in study villages or at the Municipal Health Centers. Women must be: age 18 or older,&#xD;
      otherwise healthy without disease of any major organ system, without history of seizures,&#xD;
      chronic medical problem or any neurologic disorders, without history of severe allergic&#xD;
      reaction to PZQ and willing to provide informed consent to participate. The pregnant women&#xD;
      must: have a singleton pregnancy, be carrying a fetus without evidence of anomaly by&#xD;
      ultrasound. Pregnant subjects will be treated with PZQ in early pregnancy (12-16 weeks&#xD;
      gestation) or late pregnancy (30-36 weeks gestation), lactating nonpregnant (5-7 months&#xD;
      postpartum inclusive ). A total dose of 60 mg/kg of study medication will be provided in 2&#xD;
      split doses over 3 hours as this has been shown to substantially reduce drug side effects.&#xD;
      All subjects will be hospitalized overnight for intensive blood sampling and for monitoring&#xD;
      for adverse events. Serial breast milk samples will be collected from lactating women. Plasma&#xD;
      and breast milk will be assayed for PZQ concentration. PK parameters in pregnant and&#xD;
      postpartum women will be compared and kinetics of praziquantel breast milk transfer and&#xD;
      estimation of infant PZQ dose from breast milk will be determined. Safety assessments will be&#xD;
      performed on pregnant women and their infants through 1 month postpartum, and on postpartum&#xD;
      women through 2 weeks post dosing. This study is linked to Division of Microbiology and&#xD;
      Infectious Disease (DMID) protocol 06-0039.&#xD;
