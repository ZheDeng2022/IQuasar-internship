  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some patients with brain tumors receive standard radiation to help prevent tumor growth.&#xD;
      Although standard radiation kills tumor cells, it can also damage normal tissue in the&#xD;
      process and lead to more side effects. This research study is looking at a different form of&#xD;
      radiation called proton radiotherapy which helps spare normal tissues while delivering&#xD;
      radiation to the tumor or tumor bed. Proton techniques irradiate 2-3 times less normal tissue&#xD;
      then standard radiation. This therapy has been used in treatment of other cancers and&#xD;
      information from those other research studies suggests that this therapy may help better&#xD;
      target brain tumors then standard radiation.&#xD;

      - Participants will receive proton radiotherapy at the Francis H. Burr Proton Therapy Center&#xD;
      which is located at the Massachusetts General Hospital. They will receive the proton&#xD;
      radiotherapy 5 days per week. The number of weeks the participant will be receiving proton&#xD;
      radiotherapy depends upon the tumor type and location and how well they are tolerating the&#xD;
      treatment. Participant's will have a physical exam weekly during proton radiotherapy&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Biopsy proven low grade glioma or astrocytoma, ependymoma, craniopharyngioma,&#xD;
             meningioma, neurocytoma, medulloblastoma or gangliogliomas or other rare tumor&#xD;
             requiring tumor bed or tumor irradiation. Patients with a presumed diagnosis of optic&#xD;
             glioma or gliomas based on imaging and clinical characteristics will also be allowed&#xD;
             on this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with biopsy proven high grade glioma (excluding GBM) and a gross total&#xD;
             resection and patients with non-disseminated atypical teratoid rhabdoid (ATRT) may&#xD;
             also be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pathologic diagnosis must be based on pathology or pathology review by Department of&#xD;
             Pathology at MGH or another DF/HCC institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age between 1-25 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG Performance Status 0, 1, 2 or 3 or Lansky performance status 30 or greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Girls and women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had radiotherapy to the site to be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known spinal or distant metastases. Patients with ependymoma,&#xD;
             medulloblastoma or germinoma must have metastatic workup including spine MRI to rule&#xD;
             out metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who cannot participate in contributing to the neurocognitive outcomes due to&#xD;
             severe neurologic impairment or language barrier (ie not English or Spanish speaking)&#xD;
             will be excluded from this study.&#xD;
