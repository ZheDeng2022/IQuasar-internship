  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain following total hip arthroplasty (THA) (1) is often considered moderate to&#xD;
      severe and can therefore influence the postoperative course of event and result in delayed&#xD;
      postoperative mobilization and prolonged hospitalization. It is therefore necessary to find&#xD;
      the most optimal method for alleviation of pain for these patients. Traditionally, this has&#xD;
      been managed by epidural analgesia, continuous peripheral nerve blocks, parental- or spinal&#xD;
      opioids. Recently, Drs Kerr and Kohan at the Joint Orthopaedic Centre in Sydney, Australia&#xD;
      developed a local infiltration analgesia (LIA) technique. The technique was introduced in&#xD;
      Scandinavia during 2001 and has been shown to be efficacious during knee surgery. The LIA&#xD;
      technique is based on a systemic infiltration of a mixture of a long-acting local anaesthetic&#xD;
      (ropivacaine), a non steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (ketorolac), and epinephrine into the&#xD;
      tissue around the surgical field to achieve satisfactory pain control with little&#xD;
      physiological disturbance. A catheter is left from the skin and into the joint cavity,&#xD;
      allowing repeated injection on the morning after surgery (10). Effective pain relief with&#xD;
      early mobilization and reduced hospital stay has been reported following total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty and, recently, following unicompartmental knee arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess whether LIA technique is equi-efficacious to intrathecal&#xD;
      morphine, the standard of care in our hospital.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind parallel-group study where two different methods for&#xD;
      postoperative pain relief after total hip arthroplasty, intrathecal morphine (IM) and local&#xD;
      infiltration analgesia (LIA), will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at the Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care and the&#xD;
      Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, at USÖ. A total of 80 patients undergoing total hip&#xD;
      arthroplasty will be included in the study, 40 patients in group IM and 40 patients in group&#xD;
      LIA. The patients will be divided into one of the two groups according to computer-generated&#xD;
      randomization. Study duration per patient will be 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria will take place at the&#xD;
      preoperative assessment at the outpatients' anesthesia clinic 3 - 6 weeks before the total&#xD;
      hip arthroplasty. One of the participating investigators will inform the patient, both&#xD;
      verbally and in writing, about what participation in the study involves. The patient will be&#xD;
      given time to ask questions and to consider participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient wants to be enrolled in the study, inclusion will take place at the&#xD;
      preoperative assessment that takes place before the total hip arthroplasty. One of the&#xD;
      participating Investigators would inform the patient again about what participation in the&#xD;
      study means. The patient will be given time to ask questions and to consider participation in&#xD;
      the study. The patient can be enrolled in the study after signing and dating the written&#xD;
      Informed Preoperative Preparation The patients will be informed in details about the surgery,&#xD;
      anesthesia, postoperative pain relief and physiotherapy. All patients will be asked to&#xD;
      complete two health related quality of life questionnaires, SF-36 and EQ5D (appendix 2 and&#xD;
      3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A baseline value for HOOS (appendix 4) and NRS (Numeric Rating Score) will be assessed prior&#xD;
      to surgery. The patients will also be instructed on how to use the patient controlled&#xD;
      analgesia (PCA) morphine pump that will serve as post-operative rescue medication in case of&#xD;
      pain &gt; 3 on the numeric rating scale (NRS) Dalteparin 5000 IU is administered subcutaneously&#xD;
      once each evening for 10 days, starting the night before surgery for thrombo-prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation Randomisation will be made at the USÖ Hospital Pharmacy the day before surgery.&#xD;
      The patients will be randomized into two groups, 40 patients in Group IM and 40 patients in&#xD;
      Group LIA, according to computer-generated randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study medication/saline will be prepared, blinded and labeled by a pharmacist at the USÖ&#xD;
      Hospital Pharmacy. The hospital pharmacy will send the double-blinded study medication/saline&#xD;
      to the operating theater on the day of surgery. This way, double blinding will be ensured&#xD;
      such that neither the patient nor the anaesthesiologists, the staff attending the surgery,&#xD;
      the staff concerned with the postoperative care of the patients or the physiotherapist are&#xD;
      aware of the group to which the patient has been randomized. The study medication/saline will&#xD;
      be stored in room temperature in the operating theatre and will be given within one hour from&#xD;
      the time it is received. Study medication/saline for the peri-articular injection on&#xD;
      postoperative day one will be kept in a refrigerator at the Department of Anesthesiology and&#xD;
      intensive care until it is to be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthesia All patients will receive a mixture of midazolam 0.03 mg/kg orally 1 hour before&#xD;
      planned surgery. Cloxacillin 1g will be given intravenously before surgery and at 8, 16 and&#xD;
      24 h postoperatively. The operation will be performed using spinal anaesthesia, performed in&#xD;
      the sitting position, using a 27G spinal needle. All patients will receive bupivacaine plain&#xD;
      5 mg/ml (17.5 mg = 3.5 ml) injected intrathecally. In addition, patients randomized to Group&#xD;
      IM will receive morphine special 0.4 mg/ml (0.1 mg =0.25 ml) and patients randomized to Group&#xD;
      LIA will receive an equivalent amount (= 0.25 ml) of normal saline. Total volume of injectate&#xD;
      will for each patient be 3.75 ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery and Perioperative Management The surgery will be performed in a standardized way&#xD;
      according to routine at Örebro University hospital. At the end of surgery, and after the hip&#xD;
      prosthesis is in place, patients in Group LIA would receive a total volume of 151.5 ml of a&#xD;
      mixture consisting of: a long-acting local anaesthetic (ropivacaine 2 mg/ml = 150 ml), a&#xD;
      no-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (ketorolac 30 mg/ml = 1 ml), and epinephrine (1 mg/ml =&#xD;
      0.5 ml) injected intraarticularly and into the surrounding peri-articular tissues in a&#xD;
      standardized way. Patients in Group IM would receive a similar volume (151.5 ml) of normal&#xD;
      saline injected in the same way at similar sites in order to ensure double-blinding of all&#xD;
      personnel involved in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multi-holed catheter (a peri-articular catheter) would be inserted into the tissue planes&#xD;
      under direct vision in a standardized way before closing the wound and would be connected to&#xD;
      a bacterial filter under sterile conditions. After the surgery the patient would be&#xD;
      transferred to the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) and thereafter to the orthopaedic ward&#xD;
      for further management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first post-operative day, 24 hours after surgery the following solutions will be&#xD;
      injected peri-articularly via the multi-holed catheter by a nurse who is blinded to the&#xD;
      injectate:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group LIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 ml of ropivacaine (7.5 mg/ml)&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 ml ketorolac (30 mg/ml)&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 ml of epinephrine (0.1 mg/ml)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group IM:&#xD;
&#xD;
      22 ml saline&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total volume of injectate will for each patient be 22 ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The multi-holed catheter would then be removed and the tip of the catheter sent for culture&#xD;
      and sensitivity testing. Any evidence of fever or local or systemic infection will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain Management All patients will receive 1 g paracetamol orally 4 times a day, starting on&#xD;
      the morning of the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A patient controlled analgesia (PCA) morphine pump (1 mg bolus dose, 6 min lock-out time)&#xD;
      would be connected IV in all patients, and will serve as rescue medication in case of pain &gt;&#xD;
      3 on the numeric rating scale (NRS; 0 = no pain, 10 = worst imaginable pain). The patients&#xD;
      will be instructed on its use the day before surgery. If pain is &lt; 4 during a 12 h period,&#xD;
      the PCA-pump will be discontinued and tramadol 50 mg given orally up to 4 times/day as&#xD;
      necessary as rescue medication for pain management. All patients would receive Paracetamol 1&#xD;
      g six-hourly as basal analgesic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mobilization and Home discharge The first attempt to mobilization will be made about 30 min&#xD;
      after the peri-articularly injection of study medication/saline, 24 h after surgery. The&#xD;
      patient will be asked to stand up and to walk 10 steps. If unsuccessful, another attempt will&#xD;
      be made to mobilize the patient every 12 h until the patient can walk 10 steps. If the 12 h&#xD;
      period is after 9 pm, the next attempt would be made on the following morning. Subsequently,&#xD;
      mobilization will also be quantified using a TUG test (appendix 5) from postoperative day 1&#xD;
      until discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be discharged when the discharge criteria are fulfilled:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mild pain (NRS &lt; 3) sufficiently controlled by oral analgesics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ability to walk with elbow crutches&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ability to eat and drink without nausea or vomiting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No signs of any surgical complications&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will also be asked to register pain (NRS) and analgesic consumption during the&#xD;
      first 14 postoperative days and at week 2, 3 and 4. (appendix 6)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recordings and Assessments (Flowchart, appendix 7)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age, gender, height and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of stay at the hospital (LOS):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of postoperative days to home discharge, day 0 = the day of surgery would be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home discharge criteria are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mild pain (NRS &lt; 3) sufficiently controlled by oral analgesics,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ability to walk with elbow crutches&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient can eat and drink without nausea or vomiting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No signs of any surgical complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain assessment will be recorded by NRS scale preoperatively and at 1, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and&#xD;
      48 hours postoperative, subsequently every 24 hour until the patient is discharged from&#xD;
      hospital, on day 14 and 3 and 6 months postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain will be assessed both at rest and on motion (after walking 10 steps).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analgesic consumption:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morphine consumption will be recorded during 0 - 4, 4 - 24 and 24-48 hours postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral analgesic consumption will be recorded each day until home discharge. The patients will&#xD;
      be asked to record their pain and analgesic consumption once each day for 14 days and weekly&#xD;
      on weeks 2, 3 and 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research nurse or physiotherapist will record the hip extension and flexion every 24 h&#xD;
      until discharge and after 14 days, 3 and 6 months postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TUG test will be performed från postoperative day 1 until discharge Patient satisfaction&#xD;
      during the first 24 postoperative hours and after 7 days will be rated according to a&#xD;
      satisfaction score: 1= poor, 2= satisfactory, 3= good and 4= excellent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HOOS will be collected preoperatively, and at 2 weeks, 3 and 6 months postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health-related questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SF-36 and EuroQol (EQ-5D) questionnaires will be collected preoperatively and&#xD;
      postoperatively on day 7 (only EQ-5D), 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SF-36 is a validated health survey consisting of 36 questions that measure 8 health&#xD;
      concepts: physical functioning (PF), role limitations due to physical problems (RP), bodily&#xD;
      pain (BP), general health (GH), vitality (VT), social functioning (SF), role limitations&#xD;
      secondary to emotional problems (RE) and mental health (MH). Additionally, 2 summary scores&#xD;
      are available: a standardized physical component (PCS) and a standardized mental component&#xD;
      (MCS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EuroQol (EQ-5D) is a standardised instrument for use as a measure of health outcome. It&#xD;
      provides a single index value from 0 to 1 where 0 represents death and 1 represents perfects&#xD;
      health.&#xD;
