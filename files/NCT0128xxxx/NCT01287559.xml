  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are studying a disease called &quot;necrotizing enterocolitis&quot; (or &quot;NEC&quot; for&#xD;
      short), which affects premature infants. It is the most common surgical emergency involving&#xD;
      neonates admitted to Newborn Intensive Care Units. Currently, clinicians are unable to&#xD;
      identify which infants will go on to develop NEC before they become ill. Clinical signs of&#xD;
      illness occur relatively late in the course of the condition, making NEC more difficult to&#xD;
      treat. The investigators will test a new probe that uses safe levels of visible and infrared&#xD;
      light, with and without ultrasound imaging, to see if the investigators can identify infants&#xD;
      before they get sick using a simple, noninvasive test, This test will be repeated through at&#xD;
      least one feeding (which stresses the gut) each day. If successful, the health benefit will&#xD;
      be large, as it is estimated that treating NEC alone (not including treating its later&#xD;
      complications) adds $650 million to the annual health bill.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this 5-year study, we extend our prior feasibility study to test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      very-low-birth-weight neonates (VLBW) who develop necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) can be&#xD;
      reliably detected early in the process using broadband optical spectroscopy sensitive to&#xD;
      changes in perfusion of the gut. Such perfusion changes result in regional tissue hypoxemia,&#xD;
      which we have demonstrated to be detectable by combined broadband visible/near-infrared&#xD;
      tissue oximetry, a real-time method that can assess the adequacy of deep tissue oxygenation.&#xD;
      Initially this will be an optical-only device; then combining it with ultrasound will be&#xD;
      studied in years 2-5, first on the benchtop, and then in the intensive care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common life-threatening surgical emergency&#xD;
      encountered in the neonatal intensive care unit [ ]. NEC is a multi-factorial (infectious,&#xD;
      inflammatory, and ischemic) disease of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of newborns and&#xD;
      neonates. The end result is mucosal injury and/or transmural necrosis of the intestine.&#xD;
      Currently, there is no test to diagnose NEC in the early stages of the disease, before the&#xD;
      later and ominous clinical signs appear. The mortality of NEC ranges from 10% to 50%,&#xD;
      approaching 100% for neonates with severe forms of the disease characterized by&#xD;
      full-thickness necrosis of the intestine, followed by rupture and sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ninety percent of NEC cases occur in infants born before 36 weeks' gestational age, occurring&#xD;
      in up to 10% of all very-low-birth-weight (VLBW, &lt;1500g) neonates [ ]. A diagnosis of NEC&#xD;
      increases the NICU length of stay by 22-60 days, and increases the total hospital charges by&#xD;
      $76,000-$186,000 per case [ ]. Finally, Neonates recovering from NEC often incur additional&#xD;
      serious complications (malnutrition, liver dysfunction). NEC requiring surgery carries&#xD;
      increased risk of cerebral palsy, cognitive or psychomotor impairment, or both.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeated attempts to use clinical signs to reliably identify neonates most likely to progress&#xD;
      to severe NEC have been unsuccessful. Broadband oximetry appears to offer a solution.&#xD;
      Developed by the PI and others, broadband oximetry is sensitive to ischemia. It differs from&#xD;
      typical near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) methods that generally use only 2-4 wavelengths in&#xD;
      that broadband oximetry measures hundreds of wavelengths. Broadband approaches, have shown&#xD;
      significantly tighter normal ranges, lower noise, and better reproducibility in vivo.&#xD;
      Further, typical NIRS fails to account for shifts in water, fat, blood volume, and stool, any&#xD;
      of which can affect oxygenation measurements if not specifically accounted for, making NIRS&#xD;
      unreliable for quantitative studies of the gut. In contrast, in our just-completed 1-year&#xD;
      feasibility R43 trial, we demonstrated that NEC can be detected using broadband methods. The&#xD;
      question remains: how will this new device perform clinically in a multicenter study? By&#xD;
      incorporating broadband oximetry monitoring into the management of VLBW neonates, we may&#xD;
      detect NEC at its earliest stages and prevent the cascade that leads to bowel necrosis.&#xD;
      Success should lead quickly to clinical use, as this team has previously developed, received&#xD;
      FDA approval for, and commercialized two biomedical devices.&#xD;
