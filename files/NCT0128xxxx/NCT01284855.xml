  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at comparing two doses of antivenom in the treatment of snake bite&#xD;
      envenoming. It will take place in 3 centers in rural Nepal and will involve 250 snake bite&#xD;
      victims presenting with one or more sign of neurotoxic envenoming. The objective of the study&#xD;
      is to generate enough scientific evidence to improve Nepal's current national guidelines for&#xD;
      the management of snake bites.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Snake bites are considered as one of the major neglected public health issues of tropical&#xD;
      areas. They occur chiefly in developing countries and mainly affect poor rural communities.&#xD;
      Besides the inadequate supply, distribution and accessibility of antivenom, a major problem&#xD;
      is the absence of standardized and adequate treatment protocol. There is a significant&#xD;
      diversity in clinical practices, in particular concerning the dose of antivenom given.&#xD;
      Additionally, antivenom is often given even in the absence of a clear indication for&#xD;
      envenoming. Altogether, this leads to an incredible waste of a scarce and costly resource.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Nepal there are gross disparities in the management and outcomes of snake bite envenoming.&#xD;
      The country's national guidelines, issued in 2004, prescribe an initial antivenom dose that&#xD;
      is 5 times less than the one advocated by most experts. The dosage recommended by the&#xD;
      National guidelines is not based on scientific or clinical evidence, and currently, there is&#xD;
      confusion about the adequate dose to be administered. Some physicians follow recommendations&#xD;
      published by experts, others follow the National guidelines, but for most, dosage is&#xD;
      arbitrary. These discrepancies directly impact on morbidity and mortality and lead to wastage&#xD;
      of a costly treatment that few can afford.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal objective of the study is to establish unequivocally which dosage regimen is&#xD;
      the most appropriate for the treatment of snake bite neurotoxic envenoming. It is a&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, clinical trial comparing high and low initial doses of snake&#xD;
      polyvalent antivenom also known as Anti Snake Venom Serum (ASVS). 250 snake bite victims&#xD;
      showing signs of neurotoxic envenoming will be enrolled over 2 years in three health centres&#xD;
      of Southern Nepal. Each participant will initially receive either 2 vials or 10 vials of&#xD;
      snake polyvalent antivenom. Mortality, the proportion of patients needing assisted&#xD;
      respiration, and the percentage of patients who show worsening of neurotoxic signs and&#xD;
      therefore require additional doses of antivenom will be compared in both arms. The kinetics&#xD;
      of recovery and the total consumption of antivenom will also be compared. Finally, the&#xD;
      incidence and severity of early and late adverse reactions to antivenom will be assessed. The&#xD;
      economical impact of snake bite envenoming will also be determined by measuring direct and&#xD;
      indirect costs to both health services and individual victims. Because they chiefly affect&#xD;
      agricultural workers and children, snake bites have serious economic consequences, a fact&#xD;
      that is frequently overlooked by national authorities.&#xD;
