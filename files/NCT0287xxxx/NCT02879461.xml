  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stenosis of symptomatic lumbar canal is presented as a series of degenerative changes&#xD;
      affecting the various vertebral segment structures, including: a joint zigoapofisária, yellow&#xD;
      ligament, the articular capsule and the intervertebral disk. These changes decrease the area&#xD;
      of the spinal canal and press the neural structures and may present clinically as the narrow&#xD;
      tunnel syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This presentation was first described by Verbiest associated with these anatomical changes&#xD;
      the clinical manifestations; corresponding to low back pain, pain in the legs that worsen&#xD;
      with the fact ambulate and improve with rest, this presentation called neurogenic&#xD;
      claudication .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lumbar canal stenosis was divided into two main types; congenital and acquired . The&#xD;
      first is associated with a reduced size of the pedicles, which leads to a reduction of the&#xD;
      diameter of the spinal canal, common in patients achondroplasics . The acquired is considered&#xD;
      the most common type and is associated with aging, including all anatomical structures of the&#xD;
      lumbar segment .&#xD;
&#xD;
      With an aging population the number of symptomatic patients is increasing, although there is&#xD;
      no statistic defined stenosis of symptomatic lumbar canal is the main reason for surgical&#xD;
      approaches to the spine in patients over 60 years of age (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As described by Daffner et al a reduction in blood flow leads to production of inflammatory&#xD;
      mediators, which associated with anatomical changes previously described lead to the clinical&#xD;
      picture with lameness and pain in the lower limbs Treatment of these patients is beginning&#xD;
      with guidance on the disease, adequate pain control, physical therapy and exercise for&#xD;
      maintaining the activities of daily living. If these measures fail a surgical approach may be&#xD;
      necessary, especially in patients with exercise intolerance, difficulty walking and urinary&#xD;
      incontinence .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical approach despite being widely studied in the literature prospective controlled&#xD;
      studies are rare, found series of case studies or retrospective studies, we try to evaluate&#xD;
      the effectiveness of surgery compared to rehabilitation in symptomatic patients in an attempt&#xD;
      to assess the impact of surgery associated with comparing therapy with isolated therapy in&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;

      these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.OBJETIVOS The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of surgical approach&#xD;
      associated with physiotherapy compared with physiotherapy alone in the quality of life in the&#xD;
      lumbar narrow tunnel syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: to evaluate the influence of physical therapy on muscle gain and&#xD;
      improves the conditioning of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the incidence of complications in patients undergoing surgical approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. PATIENTS AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 - Delineation Our research contains a controlled prospective, randomized and blinded to&#xD;
      the evaluator that evaluates the effectiveness of the surgical approach more physical therapy&#xD;
      associated with isolated physical therapy in symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 - Patients As research subjects will be randomized 62 patients through board electronic&#xD;
      randomization ..&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be included patients aged 50 to 75 years, of both genders, who agreed to&#xD;
      participate in the work, having previously agreed to sign the consent form. Patients will be&#xD;
      subject to an anthropometric assessment, with altitude record, weight and presence of&#xD;
      associated comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the initial evaluation, patients will be randomized, with a group that will undergo&#xD;
      surgery and after 3 weeks postoperatively initiated a rehabilitation program, a second group&#xD;
      will be isolated physiotherapy. As an evaluation factor, also you will be given a bottle of&#xD;
      paracetamol 750 mg and dated sheet, which will be instructed to register the day and the&#xD;
      number of capsules taken for a period of 90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 - Clinical diagnosis In the clinical diagnosis of the case was the presence of&#xD;
      claudication under walk 100m and at least two of the following complaints in lower limb pain,&#xD;
      weakness, burning or tingling that worsens with walking and improves with the stop of&#xD;
      ambulation and may or may not It is associated with low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 - Radiological diagnosis In our study, the presence of lumbar canal stenosis was&#xD;
      considered with an area less than 100mm2, based on criteria Hamanishi measured on MRI of the&#xD;
      lumbar spine in follow-L3 to S1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients underwent MRI on a device of 1 Tesla (Philips, Giroscan) belonging to the image&#xD;
      of Hospital Santa Marcelina, SP. The test was done with the patient supine and cushion on his&#xD;
      knees to maintain flexion of the hip and knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To avoid bias in the channel area due to the angle, all the cuts were made parallel to the&#xD;
      discs, being accepted a difference of angle of at most 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The calculation was based on mathematical values, as follows: we calculated the laterolateral&#xD;
      diameter (a) and anteroposterior (b) where the major axis whose data were provided by&#xD;
      computer program (OSIRIX® 2010) on the scanned image. In case there were any differences, the&#xD;
      figures would be recalculated and decided whether, then, for an average value between the&#xD;
      measures. After calculating these values were divided by two, individually and multiplied by&#xD;
      the value π (PI) . The obtained result is multiplied by a constant ranging from 0.8 (when the&#xD;
      channel was circular), 0.7 (where the channel was elliptical), in the presence of 0.6 and 0.5&#xD;
      facet compression, when compression was made by the disc and the facets. Thus, (a / 2) x (b /&#xD;
      2) x π (constant) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5 - Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the patient's initial assessment and the same take part in the study. Will be&#xD;
      randomized in one of the groups the 1st group will be associated with decompression with&#xD;
      arthrodesis implant placement type pedicle screws, are included patients requiring&#xD;
      decompression of up to three levels. After three weeks of surgical treatment the patient&#xD;
      started a rehabilitation program with physiotherapy assistance with weekly frequency for a&#xD;
      period of 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second group is subjected to a rehabilitation program isolated identical to the 1st group&#xD;
      for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will be offered 750 mg of paracetamol for up to 3 taken daily for 90 days. The&#xD;
      evaluations will be carried out at the time of inclusion in the project, and the patient who&#xD;
      undergoes surgery had performed surgery the following week after the assessment. The second&#xD;
      evaluation will be conducted 4 weeks after, in both groups, this evaluation will be conducted&#xD;
      to compare the muscle losses after surgery. The following evaluations will be performed in&#xD;
      T12, 12 weeks after the start of rehabilitation, 24 and 48 weeks after the start of&#xD;
      rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be also evaluated the incidence of complications in patients undergoing surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are on medical treatment and opt for surgical treatment may do so at any time of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an auxiliary method of evaluation will be made a mensuramento the quadriceps diameter and&#xD;
      sural triceps at all owner?.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.6 - Assessment tools&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Visual Analog Scale (VAS): instrument subjectively assesses the pain using a visual&#xD;
           analog scale, in which the patient quantifies the degree of their pain following a line&#xD;
           of 0 to 10 cm, with 0 being no pain and 10 unbearable pain (FERRAZ, 1990). The patient&#xD;
           was asked about the pain he felt to walk last week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Roland-Morris is extracted questionnaire physical component of the Sickness Impact&#xD;
           Profile, plus in each question, the phrase &quot;because of my back.&quot; This questionnaire&#xD;
           consists of 24 questions relevant to the daily lives of individuals with low back pain,&#xD;
           easy application, applied in less than 5 minutes and immediately score&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 6-minute walk test: used to evaluate the functional capacity of the patient. The test&#xD;
           was performed on a track of 22 meters traveled at a maximum speed achieved by the&#xD;
           patient for six minutes following the guidelines of the American Thoracic Society&#xD;
           (American Toracic Society (ATS) Committee on Proficiency Standards for Clinical&#xD;
           Pulmonary Function Laboratories).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Short Form SF36: generic instrument to assess quality of life, translated from English&#xD;
           into Portuguese and validated with 36 questions divided into eight areas. In this&#xD;
           questionnaire are discussed aspects related to functional capacity, limitations on&#xD;
           physical aspects, pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, emotional aspects&#xD;
           and mental health. The score ranges from zero to one hundred, zero being the worst&#xD;
           health condition, and one hundred the best .&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Scale Likert: It is a psychometric scale commonly used in questionnaires where the&#xD;
           patient reports his opinion directly, according to their view of treatment: much better,&#xD;
           somewhat better, not better, just worse and worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Disability Index Oswestry The ODI is used for functional evaluation of the lumbar spine,&#xD;
           incorporating measures of pain and activity. The scale consists of 10 questions six&#xD;
           alternatives, whose value ranges from 0 to 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.7 - Calculation of n. Considering a 80% power and 5% significance, to compare VAS between&#xD;
      the two groups at 5 different times, considering a standard deviation equal to 2 and a&#xD;
      minimum difference between the measures equal to 2, it took 31 individuals in each group to&#xD;
      greater certainty as to the validity of the results.&#xD;
