    <textblock>
      The liver may not be an optimal site for islet transplantation due to obstacles by an instant&#xD;
      blood-mediated inflammatory response, and low revascularization of transplanted islets.&#xD;
      Therefore, intramuscular islet transplantation offers an attractive alternative, based on its&#xD;
      simplicity, enabling easier access for noninvasive graft imaging and cell explantation.&#xD;

      The field of β cell replacement therapies has progressed extensively over the last decades.&#xD;
      It is well established that successful intraportal islet transplantation can restore&#xD;
      endogenous β cell function to subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus. In fact, when the graft&#xD;
      function is optimal, insulin independence can be consistently prolonged for up to 5 years in&#xD;
      50% of patients. Several factors influence the outcome and performance of the graft upon&#xD;
      implantation. For instance, preclinical studies have confirmed the significant differences in&#xD;
      utilizing several sites for the implantation of islet grafts, but the most utilized clinical&#xD;
      approach is embolization into the liver. However, it has become evidently clear that the&#xD;
      liver may not be the optimal environment as a recipient site for pancreatic islets, owing not&#xD;
      only to immunologic, but also to anatomic and physiologic factors that may promote a decline&#xD;
      in islet function. Moreover, intrahepatic islet infusion is often associated with an&#xD;
      immediate blood- mediated inflammatory reaction , thrombosis and hepatic tissue ischemia with&#xD;
      elevated blood liver enzymes. In addition, the cross-talk between activated coagulation and&#xD;
      inflammatory mediators after implantation, dramatically affects islet cell survival and&#xD;
      engraftment, resulting in β cell dysfunction or death, depicting primary nonfunction as a&#xD;
      consequence of reduced functional islet mass. This intrahepatic environment appears to&#xD;
      potently impair the metabolic functions of transplanted islets. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      complications associated with graft recovery within the hepatic site, will further limit its&#xD;
      potential applications in exploiting insulin-secreting cells obtained from alternative cell&#xD;
      sources. These include xenogenic islets, immortalized β cell lines, embryonic stem cells, or&#xD;
      adult progenitor cells, including β cell encapsulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Restoration of β cell function is a highly desirable goal for patients with unstable&#xD;
      diabetes; therefore, the search for an alternative site that is safer for islet&#xD;
      transplantation is imperative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In man, autotransplantation of minced tissue into striated muscle following blunt dissection&#xD;
      has been successfully used in parathyroid surgery for several decades. Initially demonstrated&#xD;
      in rodents in the early 1980s, intramuscular islet transplantation (IMIT) has rarely been&#xD;
      considered as a clinically feasible implantation site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study want to provide direct evidence of the feasibility and function of autologous&#xD;
      islets transplanted in the muscle&#xD;
