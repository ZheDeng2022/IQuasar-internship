  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Around 250 millions of people in the world (3.8%) have knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Due to&#xD;
      aging and increasing obesity, the prevalence of KOA is expected to increase in the developed&#xD;
      country in the next 20 years. KOA decreases quality of life of patients through chronic pain,&#xD;
      joint stiffness, and reduced social activity, which influence emotional wellness as well. KOA&#xD;
      has also impact on the biomechanics of the lower limbs, leading or amplifying the&#xD;
      tibiofemoral misalignment and an increase of the medial knee joint loading. Increase of the&#xD;
      medial knee joint loading may lead patients into a vicious circle by increasing knee pain,&#xD;
      decreasing activities, increasing weight and disease progression. Knee brace is a&#xD;
      non-pharmacological treatment recommended for KOA. It aims to reduce misalignment of the&#xD;
      limb. However, the main issue is the poor compliance because of lack of effectiveness, more&#xD;
      drawbacks than benefits, discomfort, bad fitting, migration of the brace, bulkiness,&#xD;
      aesthetic, skin irritation, blisters and too much pressure on the knee. By its freedom in&#xD;
      design, 3D printing may resolve most of these complaints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to compare clinical and biomechanical effectiveness, comfort and patients&#xD;
      complaints of a knee brace made by 3D printing to a conventional knee brace.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The institute for Applied Health Research of Glasgow Caledonian University (GCU) will lead&#xD;
      the experimental trial. They will recruit men or women (40 to 70 years old) suffering from&#xD;
      medial KOA in Glasgow area. Participants will be in study for 10 weeks. During this period,&#xD;
      they will wear 2 different knee braces for two weeks each with a 1-week period without knee&#xD;
      brace between. Participants will have five visits to GCU: once for leg measurement to make&#xD;
      knee braces and four times to fill questionnaires and perform gait analysis. Besides, they&#xD;
      will wear activity monitor for 3 non-consecutive weeks.&#xD;
