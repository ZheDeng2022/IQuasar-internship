  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anthracycline therapy is well-known for its adverse cardiac effects. Anthracycline-induced&#xD;
      cardiotoxicity (AIC) is associated with a poor prognosis; since classical heart failure&#xD;
      treatment can potentially reverse cardiac dysfunction at the early stage of cardiac toxicity,&#xD;
      early detection of AIC is crucial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transthoracic echocardiography is recommended for monitoring left ventricular function in&#xD;
      patients receiving these molecules. In routine practice, left ventricular systolic function&#xD;
      is mainly assessed by the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), measured by&#xD;
      two-dimensional echocardiography imaging. However, LVEF depends on the operator's experience&#xD;
      and is not sensitive enough to detect subclinical myocardial dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome these limitations, two-dimensional speckle-tracking imaging has been proposed.&#xD;
      This technique allows for a study of global and regional myocardial deformation, especially&#xD;
      the longitudinal component, which appears to be the most sensitive one. Several studies have&#xD;
      already emphasized the role of global longitudinal strain (GLS) to detect slight alterations&#xD;
      in systolic function, especially in the setting of potentially cardiotoxic drugs and even&#xD;
      after low to moderate doses of anthracyclines. A recent expert consensus paper strongly&#xD;
      recommends GLS assessment for the detection of subclinical left ventricular dysfunction due&#xD;
      to anthracycline therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there is growing evidence that GLS can predict subsequent alterations in LVEF, few&#xD;
      data exist on the optimal timing to perform echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that very early measurement of GLS in the time course of&#xD;
      anthracycline therapy could predict subsequent left ventricular systolic dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was, therefore, to determine whether assessment of GLS after 150 mg/m²&#xD;
      of anthracyclines can predict AIC.&#xD;

      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-centre, prospective cohort study. The patients are evaluated at four time&#xD;
      points: visit 1 (V1), before the initiation of anthracycline therapy; visit 2 (V2), after&#xD;
      reaching a cumulative dose of 150 mg/m²; visit 3 (V3), at the end of the treatment; and visit&#xD;
      4 (V4), 1 year after V1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical examination at each visit and standard echocardiography are performed. The study is&#xD;
      approved by our ethics committee (EudraCT number 2011-002721- 22).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two-dimensional echocardiography:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiography examinations are performed using a Vivid E9 imaging device (GE Medical&#xD;
      systems, Horten, Norway). The left ventricular end-diastolic and endsystolic volumes are&#xD;
      measured from the apical two- and four-chamber views; LVEF are calculated using Simpson's&#xD;
      rule. GLS is computed from high frame rate (&gt;50 frames per second) apical views (four-, two-,&#xD;
      and three-chamber). By tracing the endocardial borders on an end-systolic frame, myocardial&#xD;
      speckles are automatically tracked on the subsequent frames. Adequate tracking is verified,&#xD;
      and manually corrected if necessary. GLS is obtained as the average of regional strains.&#xD;
      Percentage change in GLS and absolute reduction in GLS are calculated between baseline and&#xD;
      V2. Other classic diastolic and systolic parameters are recorded according to current&#xD;
      guidelines. Digital loops are stored for off-line analysis. For LVEF and GLS, digital loops&#xD;
      are done in triplicate to assess inter- and intraobserver variability. LVEF and GLS are&#xD;
      analysed by two readers. The readers are blinded to each other's measurements and to the&#xD;
      patient visit number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiographic definition of AIC:&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to a recent consensus paper, anthracycline cardiotoxicity is defined as a decrease&#xD;
      in the LVEF of &gt;10 percentage points, to a value &lt;53%, at V4. This decrease has to be&#xD;
      confirmed by a repeat echocardiography performed a few weeks after V4.&#xD;
