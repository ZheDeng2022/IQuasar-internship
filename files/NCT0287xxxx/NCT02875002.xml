      This phase 1, multicenter, open-label study is designed to find the RP2D of volasertib, a&#xD;
      PLK1 inhibitor, and belinostat, an HDAC inhibitor, when given in combination to patients with&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory B-cell or T-cell lymphoma. A standard 3+3 dose-escalation design will&#xD;
      be employed with study enrollment beginning at dose level 1.&#xD;

    <description>Dose escalation will follow the traditional 3+3 plan to determine the MTD and the recommended phase 2 doses (RP2D). The MTD will be defined as that dose level at which ≤ 1/6 patients experience Dose Limited Toxicity (DLT), with ≥ 2/6 experiencing DLT at the next higher dose level.&#xD;
If the MTD is not reached at dose level 5, consideration will be given to amending the dose level escalation schema to add an additional dose level.</description>
