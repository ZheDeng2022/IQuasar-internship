  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) have debilitating urinary&#xD;
      frequency and urgency, and chronic pelvic or bladder pain perceived to be related to the&#xD;
      bladder. Although many clinicians think that IC/BPS symptoms result from a bladder problem,&#xD;
      tight pelvic floor muscles can cause similar symptoms and might be responsible for ICBPS&#xD;
      symptoms instead of the bladder. Inadequate assessment of the problem leads to delays in&#xD;
      treatment and often years of suffering. This clinical trial will test a bladder directed&#xD;
      therapy (bladder instillations) compared to a course of pelvic floor physical therapy (PFPT)&#xD;
      to assess the role of the pelvic floor as a major contributor to pelvic pain and voiding&#xD;
      dysfunction in adult women with non-ulcerative IC/BPS. Early assessment of the pelvic floor&#xD;
      muscles in patients with IC/BPS symptoms may prevent common delays in proper diagnosis and&#xD;
      allow for early, more effective treatment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective randomized trial of pelvic floor therapy vs. bladder directed&#xD;
      therapy. The study target population consists of females, aged 18 to 85 years of age with a&#xD;
      clinical diagnosis of IC/BPS and symptoms of chronic urinary frequency, pelvic&#xD;
      pain/discomfort, and/or urinary urgency. The approximate number of subjects that will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study is 128, 64 women in each treatment group. Women who satisfy all of the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the study and randomized to receive bladder&#xD;
      treatments (instillation of medications into the bladder) or pelvic floor physical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures will include validated questionnaires, voiding diaries, and Global Response&#xD;
      Assessment (GRA). The investigators also will evaluate changes in pelvic floor muscle tone&#xD;
      and discomfort pre and post treatment, and their relationship to symptom changes. Finally,&#xD;
      the investigators will utilize their well-established urine and serum biomarkers evaluations&#xD;
      pre and post treatment to determine if they correlate with symptom change.&#xD;
