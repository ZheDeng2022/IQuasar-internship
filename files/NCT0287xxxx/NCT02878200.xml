      Reactive treatment of household contacts of a confirmed malaria case has been shown to reduce&#xD;
      infection prevalence since the former as they are at an increased risk of infection. However,&#xD;
      implementing this on a programmatic scale poses significant pressure on the health system and&#xD;
      may not be sustainable without the active involvement of the recipient community. This study&#xD;
      investigates a novel approach to reducing residual malaria transmission that combines the&#xD;
      elements of active community involvement in reactive treatment of household contacts of a&#xD;
      clinical case reporting at a health facility. The investigators hypothesize that in areas of&#xD;
      low transmission (prevalence of infection â‰¤10%), most asymptomatic carriers are clustered&#xD;
      around clinical malaria cases in the same households. Also, targeting individuals sharing a&#xD;
      sleeping area with diagnosed malaria case will reduce parasite carriage in the community.&#xD;
      This is a cluster-randomized trial where villages in Central and Upper Baddibu, North Bank&#xD;
      East Region of The Gambia, are randomized to receive either reactive treatment of household&#xD;
      contacts following a confirmed case of malaria or standard care, i.e. treatment of index case&#xD;
      only. Formative research into community perception and reaction to self-administered&#xD;
      treatment will be used to generate, adapt and evaluate messages that encourage adherence and&#xD;
      compliance to treatment. This will be tested in the first year of the implementation, and&#xD;
      findings used to develop a final model of messages to be implemented in the second year of&#xD;
      the study. The primary outcome is the prevalence of malaria infection, determined by&#xD;
      molecular methods, in all age groups at the end of the second intervention year and the&#xD;
      incidence of clinical malaria during the transmission season.&#xD;

      Achieving malaria elimination presents a challenge because of important gaps in the knowledge&#xD;
      about the strategies and tools needed achieve this. While malaria control measures aim to&#xD;
      reduce morbidity and mortality in vulnerable populations, interventions to reduce&#xD;
      transmission are designed to interrupt transmission of malaria parasites from humans,&#xD;
      especially asymptomatic parasite carriers [1], to mosquitoes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of asymptomatic infections in transmission has grown with the awareness that&#xD;
      the majority of the human reservoir of infection are asymptomatic carriers [2] and these are&#xD;
      quite difficult to target [3]. Previous malaria elimination campaigns have applied a strategy&#xD;
      of mass drug administration: extensive treatment of entire populations, irrespective of their&#xD;
      infection status, in one or multiple rounds [4]. Although transmission was interrupted in&#xD;
      some cases, albeit temporarily [5], there is a reluctance to apply this method because the&#xD;
      evidence of its impact has been mixed. A Cochrane systematic review of MDAs showed that long&#xD;
      term reductions were not possible within the current concept and highlighted the need for&#xD;
      studies in low- and moderate-transmission settings and studies that could address potential&#xD;
      barriers for community uptake, and contribution to the development of drug resistance [6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      More conservative approaches involving screening for infection with a rapid malaria&#xD;
      diagnostic test (RDT) and treating only positive individuals; mass screening and treatment,&#xD;
      did not have a significant impact on the malaria incidence [7], largely due to low test's&#xD;
      sensitivity that would miss a large proportion of infected individuals with low parasite&#xD;
      densities. Implementing reactive screening on a programmatic scale puts significant pressure&#xD;
      on the health system [8] and available field-based screening tests lack the required&#xD;
      sensitivity for low-density parasitaemia seen with asymptomatic infections [9]. More&#xD;
      importantly, understanding the local context and adapting intervention strategies may help&#xD;
      improve coverage and participation by recipient communities [10].&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study investigates a novel approach to reducing residual malaria transmission that&#xD;
      combines the elements of reactive treatment of household contacts of a clinical case&#xD;
      reporting at a health facility with the active involvement of both patients and their&#xD;
      households. The approach to implementation will be developed through formative research that&#xD;
      identifies the optimum means of community engagement that will result in the best possible&#xD;
      compliance and adherence to the treatment in the household.&#xD;
