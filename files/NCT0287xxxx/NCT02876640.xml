    <textblock>
      This phase 1b trial studies the biologic effect of 9cUAB30 on early stage breast cancer.&#xD;
      9cUAB30 is a retinoid X receptor (RXR)-selective retinoid that acts in a tissue selective&#xD;
      manner with the goal of minimizing side effects, a necessary feature of agents under&#xD;
      development for cancer prevention.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Compare molecular analysis of pre- and post-treatment tissue samples of breast cancers of&#xD;
      patients treated with 14-28 days of oral retinoid X receptor (RXR)-selective retinoid 9cUAB30&#xD;
      (9 cUAB30) will demonstrate significantly reduced proliferation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine if 14-28 days of oral RXR-selective 9c-UAB30 treatment increases apoptotic&#xD;
      index, as measured by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Examine the differences in gene expression from baseline to post-exposure breast cancer&#xD;
      samples using a custom gene panel from Nanostring Technologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To examine if the maximum concentration (Cmax) and safety of 9cUAB30 in the first 5&#xD;
      participants is affected by reducing the number of capsules at the 240 mg dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To examine the Cmax of all participants at baseline and on the day of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Determine if treatment with 2-4 weeks of 9cUAB30 prior to surgery will increase activated&#xD;
      type I dendritic cells in peripheral blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Determine if treatment with 2-4 weeks of 9cUAB30 prior to surgery will increase gene&#xD;
      expression of type I immune cells in the tumor immune environment of all participants except&#xD;
      the first 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Assess the overall safety of 9cUAB30 in comparison with known retinoid toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive retinoid 9cUAB30 orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 14 to 28 days. Patients&#xD;
      then undergo tumor resection surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 7 days and 4-5 weeks.&#xD;
