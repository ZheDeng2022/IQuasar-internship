      of Avastin® (pharmacokinetics is nested in this study for Indian patients).&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether CBT124 and Avastin® are comparable in terms&#xD;
      of efficacy, safety, immunogenicity; and whether the pharmacokinetics of CBT124 matches that&#xD;
      of Avastin® (pharmacokinetics is nested in this study for Indian patients). To test the&#xD;
      clinical equivalence in terms of efficacy and safety, a two-sided test approach based on a&#xD;
      pre-specified range to test the null hypothesis that the proposed biosimilar is either (1)&#xD;
      inferior to the reference product or (2) superior to the reference product based on the&#xD;
      pre-specified equivalence margin will be used. The equivalence margins are chosen to enable&#xD;
      detection of clinically meaningful differences in effectiveness between CBT124, candidate&#xD;
      biosimilar bevacizumab and reference product (EU-sourced Avastin®) at the 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval (CI). In this trial, asymmetric equivalence margins will be used, i.e., the upper&#xD;
      (superiority) and the lower (inferiority) bounds of the equivalence margin are not symmetric.&#xD;
      The goal is to reject the null hypothesis of non-equivalence and accept the alternative&#xD;
      hypothesis that the two treatments (in this case, CBT124 and EU-sourced Avastin®) are&#xD;
      equivalent (i.e., the differences between the two are not clinically and statistically&#xD;
      meaningful). The hypothesis testing will be performed by determining if the difference in the&#xD;
      primary end point (Objective Response Rate [ORR]) between the reference product (EUsourced&#xD;
      Avastin®) and proposed biosimilar (CBT124) is within the equivalence margin at the 95% CI.&#xD;
