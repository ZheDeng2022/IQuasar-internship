  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this project is to demonstrate the feasability of an endomicroscopic&#xD;
      biomarker of efficacy of vedolizumab and adalimumab, in Ulcerative colitis (UC) by coupling&#xD;
      vedolizumab to a fluorescent component, FITC (Fluorescein isothiocyanate) , and adalimumab to&#xD;
      rhodamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project should allow the development of a biomarker of therapeutic efficacy for&#xD;
      vedolizumab and adalimumab that can be used in a single time-frame in vivo in humans, while&#xD;
      respecting manufacturing standards and Good manufacturing procedures.&#xD;

      Patients will be recruited before initiation of vedolizumab injections. The schedule for&#xD;
      vedolizumab infusions will corresponding to the protocol follow-up visits (Week 0, W2, W6,&#xD;
      W14, W22), and flexible sigmoidoscopy appointments will be performed at Week 0 and 22.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For responder patients, the end of the study will occured two weeks after the last&#xD;
      vedolizumab infusion (W24).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At week 22, nonresponder patients to vedolizumab may be treated by adalimumab in the absence&#xD;
      of contraindication and depending on the decision of the physician responsible for the&#xD;
      patient. Patients will be treated every two weeks during 8 weeks. The protocol follow up will&#xD;
      end 2 weeks after the fourth adalimumab injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During W0 and W22, colon biopsies will be collected. Blood samples will be collected on W0,&#xD;
      W2, W6, W14, W22 (and W30 for non responder).&#xD;
