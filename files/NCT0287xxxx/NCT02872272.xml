  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The loss of skin barrier function after burn causes increased susceptibility to infections,&#xD;
      which are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in burn patients. Topical antibiotics&#xD;
      are one part of the therapeutic arsenal available to treat these infections. Pseudomonas&#xD;
      aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are the two major colonizing agents found in this&#xD;
      population of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of dressings impregnated with amikacin is a common practice. Actually, there are no&#xD;
      available data on local and systemic effects with this antibiotic. The study of tissue and&#xD;
      plasma pharmacokinetics of amikacin is therefore very important to secure and optimize this&#xD;
      singular use of amikacin and improve the care of burn patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to describe the plasma and tissue pharmacokinetics of amikacin&#xD;
      after dermal administration and impregnated dressing to estimate the pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      parameters and their variability in a burned population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to assess on the one hand the relationship between the effectiveness&#xD;
      of treatment and the concentration of antibiotic at the site of tissue infection, and on the&#xD;
      other hand to assess the relationship between plasma concentration and the toxicity found of&#xD;
      this treatment. We would like also to note the efficacy of the antibiotic treatment in terms&#xD;
      of: need for repeat surgery (new skin graft), healing time and hospital length of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples and skin biopsies will be made for each patient to day 3 and day 7 after the&#xD;
      start of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The knowledge about the tissue concentrations obtained and a possible systemic absorption&#xD;
      will then provide additional safety data and optimize the conditions of use of these&#xD;
      dressings (dosage, frequency of administration) for effective treatment and safe.&#xD;
