    <textblock>
      Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), as the most common subtype non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL),&#xD;
      has great heterogeneity in clinical manifestations, histological morphology and prognosis.&#xD;
      R-CHOP Protocol (Rituximab + Vindesine + Cyclophosphamide + Epirubicin + Prednisone) is the&#xD;
      gold therapeutic criteria for patients with NHL, and it is also used as the first-line&#xD;
      treatment for patients with DLBCL. After treatment, 50％～60％of patients with DLBCL receive&#xD;
      complete remission (CR), 30％～40％ recurrent and 10% will never be cured due to initial and&#xD;
      secondary drug tolerance. This study aimed to explore whether Cinobufacini Tablets had&#xD;
      synergistic effect in the treatment of DLBCL, and whether its action was in close association&#xD;
      with the positive expression of Na+/K+-ATPase α3, and to observe the rates of adverse&#xD;
      reactions induced by Cinobufacini Tablets during treatment.&#xD;

      Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), as the most common subtype non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL),&#xD;
      accounts for 30％～40％ of adults with NHL, and has great heterogeneity in clinical&#xD;
      manifestations, histological morphology and prognosis. R-CHOP Protocol (Rituximab + Vindesine&#xD;
      + Cyclophosphamide + Epirubicin + Prednisone) is the gold therapeutic criteria for patients&#xD;
      with NHL, and it is also used as the first-line treatment for patients with DLBCL. After&#xD;
      treatment, 50％～60％of patients with DLBCL receive complete remission (CR), 30％～40％ recurrent&#xD;
      and 10% will never be cured due to initial and secondary drug tolerance. The study of Tao Wu&#xD;
      et al in domestic showed that cinobufacini combined with CHOP protocol had excellent efficacy&#xD;
      in the treatment of NHL, with response rate reaching up to 91.7%, and the adverse reactions&#xD;
      were mild and tolerable, whereas the response rate of single CHOP was only 62.5%. In the&#xD;
      clinical practice of our studies, it was also found that some patients with recurrent DLBCL&#xD;
      NHL also had shrunken or disappeared tumors and a survival time of more than 2 years after&#xD;
      single administration of cinobufacini tablets for 3~6 months following the withdrawal of&#xD;
      chemotherapy. This study aimed to explore whether Cinobufacini Tablets had synergistic effect&#xD;
      in the treatment of DLBCL, and whether its action was in close association with the positive&#xD;
      expression of Na+/K+-ATPase α3, and to observe the rates of adverse reactions induced by&#xD;
      Cinobufacini Tablets during treatment.&#xD;
