      Surgical samples of human primitive breast: In order to use human samples from the&#xD;
      anatomo-pathological laboratory collection, several statements will be signed and coordinated&#xD;
      by the legal department of Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) and Institut&#xD;
      National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale (INSERM) in accordance with Centre&#xD;
      Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU). Representative and various surgical samples of human&#xD;
      primitive breast carcinoma in terms of histological type (no special type, lobular etc …),&#xD;
      grade, tumor size (except tumor less than 1 cm for having enough material), hormone receptor&#xD;
      status, HER2 status and index of proliferation will be prospectively analysed. Moreover,&#xD;
      healthy tissue from the same patient will be analysed in parallel. Adjacent normal epithelial&#xD;
      structures will be defined as at least 5 mm away from the tumor and histologically normal in&#xD;
      appearance, as independently determined by a clinical pathologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All clinical characteristics of the patients will be collected : age at diagnosis, body mass&#xD;
      index, nulliparous status or not, pre-peri- or post- menopausal status, systemic adjuvant&#xD;
      treatment in terms of hemotherapy, tailored therapy and local treatments. Moreover all&#xD;
      histo-pathological characteristics of the infiltrative primary breast carcinoma will be&#xD;
      determined by team 2 :histological type (no special type, lobular etc …), grade Scarff-Bloom&#xD;
      et Richardson (SBR), tumor size, hormone receptor status (estrogen and progesterone&#xD;
      receptor), HER2 status (overexpression/amplication), index of proliferation (count of mitosis&#xD;
      and antigen KI67), presence or not of embole vascular, presence or not of in-situ carcinoma&#xD;
      and nodal status. For the human breast tissue cohort, the amounts of connective tissue and&#xD;
      collagen will be determined as percent of positive intralobular stain to total lobular area&#xD;
      per case. Intralobular connective tissue content will be examined using Hematoxylin and Eosin&#xD;
      (H&amp;E) stain and fibrillar collagen content via Masson's trichrome stain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isolation and differentiation of human monocyte-derived Mphs: Human Mphs will be&#xD;
      differentiated from blood monocytes isolated from the same patient than the tumor sample.&#xD;
      Blood samples will be obtained following standard ethical procedures and with the approval of&#xD;
      the concerned Internal Review Boards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human blood-derived Mphs will be stained with CellTracker™ Green 5-chloromethylfluorescein&#xD;
      diacetate (CMFDA) Dye prior to co-culture with breast tumors explants to allow distinguishing&#xD;
      them from endogenous Mphs in immunohistochemistry staining.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ex vivo tumor slice preparation and co-culture with Mphs: Ex vivo tumor slices will be&#xD;
      performed. Surgical samples will be embedded in 3% low gelling temperature agarose prepared&#xD;
      in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) to allow for easier slicing. 500-µm slices will be&#xD;
      obtained with a microtome dedicated to live tissues, a Krumdieck tissue slicer filled with&#xD;
      ice-cold PBS set to medium blade and arm speeds. Slices will be cultured on 30-mm cell&#xD;
      culture insert featuring a hydrophilic PolyTetraFluoroEthene (PTFE) membrane with pore size&#xD;
      of 0.4 µm (Merck Millipore) placed inside 6-well plates containing 1.1 mL of Dulbecco's&#xD;
      Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with or without Ameboid Migration (AM) or Mensenchymal Migration&#xD;
      (MM) inhibitors. The same day, co-cultures will be performed by seeding 5 × 105 human&#xD;
      Monocyte Derived Macrophages (hMDMs) on top of tumor slices and left in a 37°C 5% CO2&#xD;
      environment. Culture medium will be replaced daily for three days before overnight fixation&#xD;
      with formalin at 4°C (Sigma-Aldrich).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For determination of the Mph migration mode, two parameters will be evaluated to determine&#xD;
      the migration mode of Mphs inside tumors: the sensitivity to inhibitors and the cell&#xD;
      morphology.Mph will be layered on tumor slices from breast tumor biopsies in the presence or&#xD;
      absence of the AM inhibitor (20 µM Y27632) or the MM inhibitor (10 µM Batimastat) to identify&#xD;
      the Mph migration mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inhibitors: If the infiltration of Mphs into tissues is inhibited by Y27632 (a ROCK&#xD;
      inhibitor) and insensitive to protease inhibitors, and then allow to conclude that they use&#xD;
      the AM. If the opposite is true, it will conclude that they use the MM. If inhibitors have an&#xD;
      additional effect, it will conclude that both AM and MM are used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cell morphology: [Mph have an elongated and protrusive morphology during MM. In contrast,&#xD;
      during AM, Mph show a round morphology. Although difficult to assess on ImmunoHistoChemistry&#xD;
      (IHC) slices, Mph morphology will be analyzed. If elongated Mph can be detected, it will&#xD;
      provide us with additional information to conclude on the migration mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunohistochemistry on tumor slices: Tumor slices used in co-cultures with hMDMs will be&#xD;
      embedded in paraffin. For Mph infiltration quantification assays, slices will then be cut&#xD;
      along the diameter and serial sectioning will be performed along the cut. Sections will be&#xD;
      stained using an anti-CellTracker™ Green CMFDA Dye Rabbit Polyclonal Antibody (Life&#xD;
      technologies) to specifically stain exogeneously added human MDMs. To determine viability of&#xD;
      tissue slices, sections will be stained with hematoxylin and eosin to assess cell apoptosis&#xD;
      and necrosis. Slides will then be scanned using a Panoramic 250 Flash II slide scanner&#xD;
      (3DHISTECH, Hungary) with a 20× magnification lens..The number of Mphs per mm2 of tissues&#xD;
      will be quantified (Mirax Scan Zeiss virtual slide scanner). This task will be accomplished&#xD;
      withDrTalal Al Saati, supervisor of the experimental histopathology technical platform&#xD;
      (INSERM-IFR150/Génopole Toulouse-Midi Pyrénées, CHU Purpan, Toulouse).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Value-creation of experimental results: The Mph migration mode will be identified in a&#xD;
      significant number of human primitive breast carcinoma of each type as defined by clinicians,&#xD;
      based on their histological type, grade, tumor size, hormone receptor status, HER2 status and&#xD;
      index of proliferation and clinical characteristics of the patients collected by team2.&#xD;
      Moreover, the migration mode of Mph in the healthy tissue from the same patients will be&#xD;
      analysed in parallel and will be used as a reference of Mph migration in non-tumoral tissue&#xD;
      in each patients. Then, it will determine i) if Mph perform MM in all types of tumor or if&#xD;
      they use MM in some tumors and AM in others, and ii) whether a correlation exists between the&#xD;
      migration mode used by macrophages to infiltrate tumors and the type of tumor. Finally, it&#xD;
      will establish if there is a correlation between the invasive properties of the studied&#xD;
      breast cancer (which will be determined by histo-pathological analysis performed by team2)&#xD;
      and the migration mode used by Mph in order to determine whether a correlation exists between&#xD;
      the migration mode used by macrophages and tumor invasiveness. Actually, the result expected&#xD;
      is that when TAMs use the MM which involves proteases and deep remodeling of the&#xD;
      extracellular matrices, the tumor invasiveness will be higher than in tumors in which Tyro-3,&#xD;
      Axl, and Mer (TAMs) use the AM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the long term, the patient outcome will also be taken into account in these analyses as an&#xD;
      additional knowledge about the relationship between TAM migration and tumor progression.&#xD;
