      This study aims to develop highly sensitive methods for early detection of relapse based on&#xD;
      the patients unique mutations. Initially, a mutational screen is being performed. Primers&#xD;
      directed against these mutations will be constructed and presence of mutations will be&#xD;
      followed in bone marrow and blood frequently after transplantation.&#xD;

      This study aims to develop highly sensitive methods for early detection of relapse based on&#xD;
      the patients unique mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening of mutations In collaboration with Department for clinical genetics, Uppsala, an&#xD;
      initial screening of mutations will be performed using the commercial TrueSight© sequencing&#xD;
      panel which includes 54 genes recurrently mutated in myeloid diseases. Based on the mutations&#xD;
      identified, PCR-primers for all patient-specific mutations will be designed. Patients without&#xD;
      any mutation will be excluded from the study. The mutational screen is performed as soon as a&#xD;
      patient is being identified as a potential candidate for allogeneic stem cell transplantation&#xD;
      (SCT) and evaluated for most optimal pre-SCT treatment. The patient is included in the study&#xD;
      before the bone marrow sampling preceding SCT. In case a mutational screen has not been&#xD;
      performed before pre-SCT MDS treatment, a mutational screen from the diagnostic national&#xD;
      biobank sample (peripheral blood) can be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRD surveillance After the transplantation, peripheral blood samples will be collected once&#xD;
      monthly; and bone marrow samples will be collected at month 1, 3, 6 after SCT followed by&#xD;
      sampling every third month until relapse or death. The samples are sent to Biobanking and&#xD;
      Molecular Resource Infrastructure of Sweden (bbmri) who will extract DNA and store the&#xD;
      samples. By using the highly sensitive digital-PCR method the investigators will determine&#xD;
      the size of the different clones at the different time points. In addition to biobanking of&#xD;
      DNA, bbmri will collect and vital froze mononuclear cells (MNCs) to be used for experimental&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Landmark analyses will be performed at different time points after SCT, using&#xD;
      presence of MRDs as a risk factor included in a multivariate analysis. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      investigators will calculate sensitivity, specificity and predictive value for MRDs in&#xD;
      relation to relapse. For each specific mutation, with high enough frequency in the cohort,&#xD;
      the investigators will define cut-off values of the MRD where relapse is impending.&#xD;
