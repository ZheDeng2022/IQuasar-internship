    <textblock>
      The WristBot constitutes a comprehensive, integrated robotic system for the early diagnosis&#xD;
      and rehabilitation of sensory and fine motor dysfunction to neurological or orthopedic&#xD;
      disease. It has been validated in three clinical trials, including orthopaedic patients,&#xD;
      Parkinsons disease and 9 chronic stroke patients. Its unique feature uses adaptive,&#xD;
      progressive robot-aided therapy to achieve intensive, task specific wrist movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the context of the proposed project we will target the stroke population. Integration&#xD;
      refers here to the system's ability to perform the assessment of proprioceptive status and&#xD;
      proprioceptive training in a single device. The scope of the current project is investigating&#xD;
      the efficacy of the proprioceptive assessment of the WristBot and correlating the result&#xD;
      throughout the rehabilitation protocol. The proposed technology comprises a hardware device&#xD;
      with four motors that can apply torques to the human wrist about its three degrees of freedom&#xD;
      (i.e. axes of rotation: wrist flexion/extension,abduction/adduction and forearm&#xD;
      pronation/supination). This allows for guided and controlled movements of the wrist by&#xD;
      delivering assistive, resistive, perturbation or no forces (patient actively moves the&#xD;
      wrist). It contains a set of specialized software modules that a) allow for the objective,&#xD;
      psychophysical assessment of sensory dysfunction in patients, and b) provide specialized&#xD;
      training modules designed to improve sensory and motor functions of the wrist.&#xD;
