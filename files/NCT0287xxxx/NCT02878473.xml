  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diagnosis of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) is increasingly common in patients with&#xD;
      liver cirrhosis, but these patients are denied liver transplantation (LT) by most centres due&#xD;
      to historically poor results. Two retrospective evaluations have shown a 5 year survival ~65%&#xD;
      in selected patients with an iCCA diagnosis at the pathology of the explanted liver. This&#xD;
      suggests that LT can be a curative treatment if applied selectively. This study will evaluate&#xD;
      the effectiveness of LT as a treatment for very early iCCA diagnosed in cirrhotic patients&#xD;
      who meet the strict selection criteria. Patients with advanced cirrhosis (not candidates for&#xD;
      resection) currently have no other curative treatment options. Participants will be allowed&#xD;
      bridging therapies prior to receiving transplant. Participants will be followed for 5 years&#xD;
      from the time of transplant with patient survival and disease recurrence as outcome measures.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Diagnosis of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) is increasingly common in patients with&#xD;
      liver cirrhosis. iCCA is not an indication for Liver transplantation (LT) at most transplant&#xD;
      centres given the historically poor rates of survival and high rates of disease recurrence. A&#xD;
      recent retrospective study shows that patients found to have very early iCCA on explant after&#xD;
      undergoing LT for another indication, had a 5 year survival of 65% and recurrence rate of&#xD;
      13%.This suggests that LT can be a curative treatment if applied selectively and that it is&#xD;
      time to reevaluate LT as a treatment option for those with very early iCCA. This study will&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of LT as a treatment for very early iCCA diagnosed in cirrhotic&#xD;
      patients. Diagnosis of iCCA will be based upon biopsy results of a new tumor which does not&#xD;
      present radiologically as an HCC. Patients fulfilling the strict study selection criteria&#xD;
      will undergo a full transplant assessment and must be deemed otherwise &quot;suitable&quot; for liver&#xD;
      transplant as per their centre's criteria. Patients will be treated with bridging therapies&#xD;
      while they are on the transplant waiting list according to each center's policy. Patients&#xD;
      with disease progression (tumor &gt;3cm or development of extrahepatic disease) at any time&#xD;
      prior to transplantation will be excluded. Participants will be followed for 5 years from the&#xD;
      time of transplant with patient survival and disease recurrence as outcome measures.&#xD;
