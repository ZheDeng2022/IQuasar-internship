  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic heart failure is a common disease. It is also a serious disease with a mortality of&#xD;
      50% at 5 years, representing a significant cost in terms of public health expenditure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart transplantation represents the &quot;gold standard&quot; of care for terminal heart failure&#xD;
      patients reached the end of the disease despite optimal medical and surgical management of&#xD;
      their disease, with a survival rate of transplant patients by 90% at 1 year and 82% at 3&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long term LVAD are an innovative technology available for more than a decade, developed in&#xD;
      part because of the shortage of cardiac grafts and high mortality among patients waiting for&#xD;
      transplants due to an important pending.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This technique is used substantially only for ten to fifteen years in the world. Survival&#xD;
      after implantation of latest devices reaches 80% at 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In France, this technique is intended for patients with terminal heart failure who ended&#xD;
      different pharmacological and invasive therapeutic resources available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, academic centers that offer the possibility of long-term LVAD support are&#xD;
      organized unicentric in order to centralize specialized care for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, patients candidates for the establishment of a long-term LVAD are rigorously selected&#xD;
      to ensure an acceptable survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, practices vary considerably from one center to another in particular regarding:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Implantation indications,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-implantation patient assessment,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monitoring,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Implementation of pharmacological treatments, particularly anticoagulants or&#xD;
           betablockers.&#xD;

      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It's a prospective multicentric observational study realised on 3 University Hospital in&#xD;
      France: Bordeaux, Montpellier and Toulouse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients undergoing implantation of a long-term LVAD support whatever the brand and type,&#xD;
      on one of the 3 participating centers (Montpellier, Toulouse or Bordeaux) during the 3 years&#xD;
      period, after approval of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were followed up at 1 and 6 months, and 1 year as part of their routine management&#xD;
      of their disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients should have agreed to participate in the observatory, knowing that participation or&#xD;
      refusal to participate will not alter the therapeutic attitude of the team responsible for&#xD;
      the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main aim is 1 year mortality of LVAD recipients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aim are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Descriptive epidemiology of LVAD implantation: prevalence, etiology, affected&#xD;
           populations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Description of the state of practice: indications, against-indications, preimplantation&#xD;
           data, intraoperative data, postoperative data, tracking data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rating prognosis of patients under LVAD support&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In-hospital, 30 days, 6 months, and 1 year survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of transplanted and assisted patients at 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of complications (infections, bleeding, thromboembolism, equipment failures,&#xD;
           ...)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analyses in subgroups according to age, sex, initial indication (including ischemic&#xD;
           heart disease vs nonischemic), assistance used and year of implantation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research of prognostic factors for postoperative and chronic right ventricular failure,&#xD;
           prognostic factors of cardiovascular and all causes death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on historical data of the concerned centers (CHU Montpellier, Bordeaux and Toulouse)&#xD;
      and recent predictions of french health authority HAS (&quot;Haute Autorité de Santé&quot;), 200&#xD;
      patients are provided in the observatory register, rhythm about 20-30 patients per year per&#xD;
      center for a 3-year recruitment period Monitoring will be carried out by the referring&#xD;
      physician for each patient at 1 and 6 months, and at 1 year in the usual care of pathology in&#xD;
      each center with the possibility to adapt the follow-up date to +/- 1 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients who have moved and have therefore changed of referral center, an evaluation at&#xD;
      one year will be made by mail or phone contact with the physician and / or patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collect and circulation of patients' data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected under the patient's referring physician's responsibility in each&#xD;
      center. Data will be entered directly into the electronic database (e-CRF) developed&#xD;
      University of Montpellier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be identified by the number of the center (1 = Bordeaux, 2 = Montpellier 3 =&#xD;
      Toulouse) followed by the first letter of the name and the first initial and the center of&#xD;
      the patient number in question (automatic chronological number according to the entry on the&#xD;
      e-CRF - data coding is integrated into the e-CRF) Monitoring at 1 month, 6 months and 1 year,&#xD;
      will be completed by the middle of referring physicians and entered directly into the&#xD;
      electronic database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no traffic data on paper for these two steps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of lost sight, follow-up at 1 year will be carried out by the centers, by phone or&#xD;
      mail from the municipality of birth, the attending physician or cardiologist and patient,&#xD;
      which requires knowledge of the date full birth patients to avoid confusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the analysis, data will be anonymized (as shown above).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Members of the scientific committee, persons responsible for logistics and coordination&#xD;
      statistics will have access to all of the identified data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research data is entered via an electronic case report forms (e-CRF) developed from the&#xD;
      Capture System software (CLINSIGHT company), enabling quality control of data in real time.&#xD;
      To meet regulatory requirements, this software complies with the FDA's recommendations on&#xD;
      Computerized Systems for Managing Clinical Trials and electronic signature and standards&#xD;
      (CDISC, ICH, GCP 2001/20 / EC ...). The connection is via a password and a unique identifier&#xD;
      specific to each user that will give access only to his patients himself. An audit function&#xD;
      is integrated allowing traceability of data as well as changes. The encrypted data will then&#xD;
      be transmitted to the responsible center of the data-management via a secure internet&#xD;
      connection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The e-CRF must be composed of all the information required by the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information and Consent of participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the completion of this research, the free, writing and informed consent of patients&#xD;
      must be collected after information by the investigator during a consultation, and after a&#xD;
      sufficient period of reflection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants information for research should be written simply, in language understandable by&#xD;
      the patient. After having read the participant and the investigator will have dated and&#xD;
      signed the consent form (original archived by the investigator and an original will be given&#xD;
      to research participants).&#xD;
