  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The postnatal diagnosis of Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) is suggested by a prolonged QT interval on&#xD;
      12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG), strengthened by a positive family history and/or&#xD;
      characteristic arrhythmias and confirmed by genetic testing. However, for several reasons&#xD;
      such LQTS testing cannot be performed successfully before birth. First, fetal ECG is not&#xD;
      possible and direct measure of the fetal QT interval by magnetocardiography is limited to&#xD;
      fewer than 10 sites world-wide. Second, while genetic testing can be performed in utero,&#xD;
      there is risk to the pregnancy and the fetus. Third, although some fetuses present with&#xD;
      arrhythmias easily recognized as LQTS (torsade des pointes (TdP) and/or 2° atrioventricular&#xD;
      (AV) block, this is uncommon, occurring in &lt;25% of fetal LQTS cases. Rather, the most common&#xD;
      presentation of fetal LQTS is sinus bradycardia, a subtle rhythm disturbance that often is&#xD;
      unappreciated to be abnormal. Consequently, the majority of LQTS cases are unsuspected and&#xD;
      undiagnosed during fetal life, with dire consequences. For example, maternal medications&#xD;
      commonly used during pregnancy can prolong the fetal QT interval and may provoke lethal fetal&#xD;
      ventricular arrhythmias. But the most significant consequence is the missed opportunity for&#xD;
      primary prevention of life threatening ventricular arrhythmias after birth because the infant&#xD;
      is not suspected to have LQTS before birth. The over-arching goal of the study is to overcome&#xD;
      the barriers to prenatal detection of LQTS. The investigators plan to do so by developing an&#xD;
      algorithm using fetal heart rate (FHR) which will discriminate fetuses with or without LQTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediate Goal: The investigators propose a multicenter pre-birth observational cohort study&#xD;
      to develop a Fetal Heart Rate (FHR)/Gestational Age (GA) algorithm from a cohort of fetuses&#xD;
      recruited from 13 national and international centers where one parent is known by prior&#xD;
      genetic testing to have a mutation in one of the common LQTS genes: potassium voltage-gated&#xD;
      channel subfamily Q member 1 (KCNQ1), potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2&#xD;
      (KCNH2), or sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 5 (SCN5A). The investigators have&#xD;
      chosen this population because 1) These mutations are the most common genetic causes of LQTS,&#xD;
      and 2) Offspring will have high risk of LQTS as inheritance of these LQTS gene mutations is&#xD;
      autosomal dominant. Thus, progeny of parents with a known mutation are at high (50%) risk of&#xD;
      having the same parental LQTS mutation. The algorithm will be developed using FHR measured&#xD;
      serially throughout pregnancy. All offspring will undergo postnatal genetic testing for the&#xD;
      parental mutation as the gold standard for diagnosing the presence or absence of LQTS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ascertainment of LQTS, an inherited arrhythmia disorder in a group of conditions known as the&#xD;
      channelopathies, is challenging before birth. Recently, in a retrospective study it was&#xD;
      reported that a gestational age dependent bradycardia allows a much higher recognition of&#xD;
      genotype positive LQTS than the standard obstetrical gestational age independent definition&#xD;
      of bradycardia (Mitchell 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the fetal heart rate in pregnancies with maternal or paternal LQTS diagnosed prior&#xD;
      to the pregnancy has not been evaluated prospectively from the first trimester to birth. Nor&#xD;
      is it known if the fetal heart rate /gestational age profile might be mutation specific. In&#xD;
      addition, the use of fetal heart rate to successfully distinguish between LQTS and normal&#xD;
      fetuses of pregnancies in which a parent has a known mutation has not been tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that fetuses with an LQTS mutation born to families in which the&#xD;
      mother or father has an LQTS mutation will have slower heart compared to fetuses, shown after&#xD;
      birth not to have the family mutation. If the investigators hypothesis is correct, these&#xD;
      findings could be applied to the general population of pregnant women to prospectively&#xD;
      identify fetuses with LQTS and without a known family history. Since a fetal proband has been&#xD;
      led to the identification of unsuspecting family members, prospectively identifying affected&#xD;
      fetuses would increase ascertainment of life-threatening mutations in all ages (Cuneo 2013).&#xD;

    <description>The area under the ROC of the FHR/GA algorithm compared to a gold standard of genetic testing will remain ≥0.75 across mutation types and offspring sex.
