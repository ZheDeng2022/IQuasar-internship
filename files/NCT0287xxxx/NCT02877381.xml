      To determine the optimal dosing regimen and route of administration of tranexamic acid (TXA)&#xD;
      [single dose intravenous (IV), double dose intravenous, intravenous + topical, and oral&#xD;
      repeated dosing] to minimize post-operative blood loss and transfusion requirements following&#xD;

      Study Design: Prospective randomized control study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific Background/Intro: Total hip or knee arthroplasty is associated with the risk of&#xD;
      moderate to significant blood loss. Approximately one-third of patients undergoing total&#xD;
      joint replacement surgery require one to three units of blood postoperatively. Tranexamic&#xD;
      acid is a synthetic antifibrinolytic agent that has been successfully used orally,&#xD;
      intravenously, and topically to control bleeding after total joint replacement. The use of&#xD;
      TXA has been shown to significantly reduce the need for blood products during total joint&#xD;
      replacement.1-3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have explored the use of various TXA regimens following primary TKA. Tanaka et&#xD;
      al. demonstrated both that pre-operative administration of TXA was superior to&#xD;
      intra-operative administration and that a double dose regimen is superior to a single dose&#xD;
      regimen.4 Maniar et al. further supported the idea that pre-operative TXA administration is&#xD;
      superior, and the addition of higher doses of TXA improved efficacy without an increase in&#xD;
      thromboembolic complications.5 More recently, Lin et al. demonstrated that combining a&#xD;
      pre-operative IV dose of TXA with an intra-articular dose after arthrotomy closure was&#xD;
      superior to an intra-articular dose alone.6 Also, in an unpublished randomized control trial&#xD;
      that we recently completed, we found oral TXA to provide equivalent blood control at a lower&#xD;
      cost than IV TXA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well known that revision joint arthroplasty cases are more complex than primary joint&#xD;
      replacements. Revision total knee arthroplasty is associated with a greater risk of blood&#xD;
      loss and increased transfusion rates compared to primary TKA.7 Despite the vast body of&#xD;
      literature investigating TXA following primary TKA, only three retrospective studies have&#xD;
      been published on the use of TXA after revision TKA.8-10 All three studies have shown that IV&#xD;
      TXA decreased both the rate of transfusions and the amount of blood transfused when compared&#xD;
      to controls.8-10&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the TXA formulations used in primary TKA have been shown to be effective in the&#xD;
      retrospective studies, the amount of blood loss and risk of transfusion still remains&#xD;
      significantly higher than during primary TKA. By performing the first randomized control&#xD;
      trial on the use of TXA following revision TKA, we believe it will help change practice&#xD;
      patterns by providing evidence that the same TXA formulations used in primary TKA are&#xD;
      inadequate for revision TKA. Additionally, we will be exploring new combinations of TXA&#xD;
      administration to answer some questions brought up by previous studies in regards to the&#xD;
      optimal TXA regimen.&#xD;
