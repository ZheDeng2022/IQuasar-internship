      Neuroparalytic snake envenomation results in severe muscle weakness and respiratory failure.&#xD;
      Treatment requires administration of anti-snake venom and supportive care in the form of&#xD;
      invasive mechanical ventilation. Whether using adaptive support ventilation (a closed loop&#xD;
      mode of ventilation) in comparison to volume controlled ventilation will shorten the duration&#xD;
      of ventilation remains undetermined. The current study is planned to compare adaptive support&#xD;
      ventilation (ASV) mode of ventilation versus volume controlled ventilation (VCV) during&#xD;
      invasive mechanical ventilation for the management of respiratory failure secondary to&#xD;
      neuroparalytic snake envenomation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Snake envenoming is a common medical emergency encountered in the tropical countries, and an&#xD;
      estimated 35,000 -50,000 people die of snakebite every year in India. The bites of elapid&#xD;
      snakes cause predominantly neurotoxicity, which manifests as ocular and bulbar paralysis, and&#xD;
      paralysis of the muscles of respiration, with resultant respiratory failure. The management&#xD;
      of these patients includes ventilatory support and administration of snake anti-venom.&#xD;
      Respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilatory support is a frequent cause of admission&#xD;
      to the intensive care unit (ICU). Mechanical ventilation is a life-saving intervention, and&#xD;
      once there is improvement of the underlying indication, it can be withdrawn abruptly in the&#xD;
      majority. However, approximately 20-30% of patients still require gradual discontinuation&#xD;
      (ie, weaning). This process is not only difficult in patients with chronic respiratory&#xD;
      diseases and acute neuromuscular disorders, such as neurotoxic snake bite, but is also&#xD;
      associated with important complications, such as nosocomial pneumonia, prolonged ICU stay,&#xD;
      and even mortality, especially in those with persistent weaning failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adaptive support ventilation (ASV) is a closed-loop ventilation mode designed to provide a&#xD;
      user-set minimum minute ventilation in intubated patients, either actively breathing or&#xD;
      passively ventilated. ASV automatically selects a target ventilatory pattern based on user&#xD;
      inputs [patient's predicted body weight (PBW), minimum minute volume, and pressure limit] and&#xD;
      respiratory mechanics data from the ventilator monitoring system (respiratory system&#xD;
      expiratory time constant and dynamic compliance). The algorithm selects ventilatory&#xD;
      parameters so as to minimize total work of inspiration, and the ventilator continuously&#xD;
      adapts to match changes in respiratory mechanics by using automatic controls for level of&#xD;
      inspiratory pressure above positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), frequency, and&#xD;
      inspiratory time of ventilator-initiated breaths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In most studies, ASV has been used only in the weaning phase, and patients were ventilated&#xD;
      with conventional modes until weaning. However recent studies suggest its role in primary&#xD;
      ventilation in the initial phase of respiratory failure. Previous use of ASV in patients with&#xD;
      acute respiratory distress syndrome has been described from our center and the use of ASV was&#xD;
      equally efficacious to conventional mode of ventilation (volume control). In another study&#xD;
      the use of ASV in comparison to pressure control ventilation in patients with acute&#xD;
      respiratory failure reduced the weaning duration and total duration of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation. Because ASV can be used from intubation to extubation, it may also offer some&#xD;
      advantages before the weaning phase in patients with respiratory failure. Therefore, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that ASV may shorten the total mechanical ventilation (MV) duration, weaning&#xD;
      duration, and increase the weaning success rates when compared with conventional ventilation&#xD;
      in the management of patients with neuroparalytic snake envenomation.&#xD;
