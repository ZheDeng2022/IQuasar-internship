  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 'rising tide' of antimicrobial resistance is a source of concern across most infectious&#xD;
      diseases. In the UK, for example, 6.8% of the ~8,500 tuberculosis patients seen in 2012 were&#xD;
      resistant to the cheap and effective first-line drug isoniazid. It is of great importance to&#xD;
      prevent the loss of current anti-tuberculosis drugs and preventing the spread of resistance&#xD;
      by treating such patients as well as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, guidance on the best treatments for isoniazid resistant tuberculosis is&#xD;
      inconsistent globally. Data from randomised controlled trials, the peak quality of evidence,&#xD;
      is sparse. It is thus important that studies using pre-existing observational data are&#xD;
      undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to use data and samples collected from Public Health England and&#xD;
      National Health Service hospitals to determine a) the best treatments for patients with&#xD;
      isoniazid resistant tuberculosis disease (cohort study) and b) how different causes of drug&#xD;
      resistance in the infecting bacteria influence a) (nested case-control study). Eligible&#xD;
      participants will have had isoniazid resistant tuberculosis (without associated rifampicin&#xD;
      resistance) in England between 2009 and 2013 and will have been notified to Public Health&#xD;
      England. The study will be conducted at University College London, National Health Service&#xD;
      hospitals and Public Health England and will last until December 2017. Patient hospital&#xD;
      records and disease surveillance records will be accessed and cultured bacteria from&#xD;
      previously stored samples sequenced.&#xD;
