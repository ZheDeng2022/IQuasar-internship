    <textblock>
      Diabetic retinopathy(DR) is a sight threatening condition that occurs in persons with&#xD;
      diabetes. DR arises as a consequence of damage to the retinal blood vessels and is related to&#xD;
      the high and fluctuating sugar levels in the blood stream. An eye with DR will have abnormal&#xD;
      appearing retinal blood vessels which become engorged and dilated, leaky and fragile or&#xD;
      undergo closure. The net result is a picture of haemorrhage and or ischaemia (lack of blood&#xD;
      supply). A particular feature of DR is the accumulation of fluid in the macula which is the&#xD;
      central part of the retina and responsible for detailed eye sight. This peculiar form of DR&#xD;
      is called Diabetic Macular Oedema (DMO). DMO can occur in isolation without other features of&#xD;
      DR. DMO is commoner in type 2 diabetes where insulin resistance and abnormalities of blood&#xD;
      fats are found. The investigators wish to study DR and DMO using high resolution retinal&#xD;
      imaging and functional tests in normal participants, those participants with diabetes without&#xD;
      any overt signs of disease and those with DR and DMO in order to understand how the condition&#xD;
      develops and whether there are any unique risk factors that can be identified&#xD;

        Potential participants with DR of different severity levels ranging from minimal DR to&#xD;
        severe DR with or without DMO who attend the diabetic clinics will be invited to&#xD;
        participate. Opportunistic sampling will be used to ensure that the different severity&#xD;
        levels of DR and or DMO will be adequately represented.The Northern Ireland Cohort&#xD;
        Longitudinal Study On ageing (NICOLA), a non-interventional epidemiological study of&#xD;
        healthy ageing in older adults aged 50 years and above has commenced and is currently&#xD;
        recruiting some 8500 participants. Participants in NICOLA who are known to have DM or have&#xD;
        been recently diagnosed with DM will be approached and asked if willing to return for&#xD;
        detailed functional testing of the eye. This will supplement the group with DM but with no&#xD;
        changes of DR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Control participants with DM but without DR will be recruited from the metabolic clinics of&#xD;
        the Belfast Trust.&#xD;
