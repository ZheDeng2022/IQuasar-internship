    <textblock>
      The REP 301 treatment protocol involved the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B /&#xD;
      hepatitis D co-infection with two agents: REP 2139-Ca and pegylated interferon (peg-IFN). In&#xD;
      this protocol, similar reduction/clearance of serum HBsAg and improved response to&#xD;
      immunotherapy were observed in addition to clearance of serum HDV RNA. The REP 301 protocol&#xD;
      was designed to include a 24 week follow-up period after treatment, however given the strong&#xD;
      antiviral response against HBV and HDV infection in these patients, it is now important to&#xD;
      extend the follow-up period in these patients to monitor over a longer period after treatment&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy combined REP 2139-Ca / peg-IFN treatment in patients in the REP 301&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;

      The REP 301-LTF is a long-term follow-up, non-blinded study of patients from the REP 301&#xD;
      protocol. In this study, all eligible patients from the REP 301 protocol will have their&#xD;
      followup evaluation extended for an additional 3 years, consisting of 6 visits scheduled&#xD;
      every 6 months following the last follow-up visit scheduled in the REP 301 protocol. During&#xD;
      each visit a physical examination and documentation of any symptoms, experiences will be&#xD;
      conducted as well as blood tests for safety and virology as described below. This study will&#xD;
      examine the long term safety effects in patients who have completed of treatment exposure in&#xD;
      the REP 301 trial (REP 2139-Ca therapy for 30 weeks and PEG-IFN taken for 48 weeks with a 15&#xD;
      week overlap in combination) and the duration of suppression of serum HBV and HDV viremia&#xD;
      observed in the REP 301 protocol. This requires that subjects have completed antiviral&#xD;
      treatment in the REP 301 protocol and are not immediately transitioned to further antiviral&#xD;
      treatment unless necessary. The total duration of this study for each subject is 3 years.&#xD;
