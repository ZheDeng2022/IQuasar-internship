      There are numerous possible reasons why it could be speculated that HbA1c variability may&#xD;
      affect complication risk. Of interest are the concepts that both laboratory and clinic&#xD;
      evidence suggests that periods of sustained hyperglycemia are 'remembered' (metabolic&#xD;
      memory), this in turn is recognized to place patients at greater long-term risk of&#xD;
      complications. As such it can be speculated that the detrimental effect of variability in&#xD;
      HbA1c may be mediated via the same mechanism as 'metabolic memory' phenomenon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: To determine whether treatment to one of 2 threshold levels will result in one group of&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes patients having the same mean HbA1c but with differing HbA1c variability to&#xD;
      that of another and related to markers of oxidative stress, inflammation and microvascular&#xD;
      complications. To determine whether a difference in HbA1c variability between the 2 groups&#xD;
      will reflect in changes in small nerve fibers assessed with the sensitive method of corneal&#xD;
      confocal microscopy and cardiac autonomic function testing. To assess the reproducibility of&#xD;
      HbA1c measurement from a whole blood samples initially analyzed and then stored at -80C until&#xD;
      the end of the study (2-3 years), as well as storing an aliquot of haemolysate, for&#xD;
      reanalysis at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In one arm the investigators will intensify treatment in those with FPG&gt;140mg/dl until their&#xD;
      FPG is &lt;90mg/dl, using whatever treatment is clinically appropriate for them, and only&#xD;
      intensify it further if their FPG rises to &gt;140mg/dl again. In the other group the&#xD;
      investigators will intensify if their FPG is &gt;115 mg/dl until it is &lt;=115 mg/dl and intensify&#xD;
      further if &gt;115 mg/dl again. A total of 20 visits within a time frame of 2 and half years&#xD;
      will be performed. Visits procedures will include routine biochemistry, eGFR, lipids, fasting&#xD;
      glucose, insulin and full blood count, HbA1c, SHBG, hsCRP. EPIC and G-PAQ questionnaires will&#xD;
      be collected. Autonomic function testing using deep breathing heart rate variability, and a&#xD;
      sensitive measure of small fiber neuropathy using corneal confocal microscopy and a 24 hour&#xD;
      urine collection for urinary isoprostanes to measure oxidative stress will be performed, at&#xD;
      baseline, 12 and 24 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the last unanswered question in relation to the influence of glycemic control on&#xD;
      diabetes complications is whether increased month-to-month changes in blood glucose (as&#xD;
      measured by variability in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)) compounds the complication rate and&#xD;
      if this can be altered with intervention. Qatar has a high prevalence of diabetes, affecting&#xD;
      approximately 23% of the adult population (International Diabetes Federation 2014) that is&#xD;
      going to lead to the development of both microvascular and macrovascular complications&#xD;
      resulting in the increased morbidity and mortality associated with the disease. The fact that&#xD;
      improved glucose control in type 2 as well as type 1 diabetes reduces the risk of&#xD;
      microvascular complications is well established. However, more recently it has been&#xD;
      demonstrated that the month-to-month variability (the 'rises and falls') in glucose control&#xD;
      are also associated with an increased risk of developing these diabetes-associated problems.&#xD;
      An individual's long term measure of blood glucose control is represented by the amount of&#xD;
      HbA1c measured in the blood. The HbA1c level changes slowly over a much longer period than&#xD;
      the constantly fluctuating glucose levels, giving a good indication of overall glucose&#xD;
      control in the preceding 2-3 months. What is not known is whether interventions to reduce&#xD;
      variability in HbA1c could, in turn, lead to a reduction in diabetes complications. For&#xD;
      example even when HbA1c mean is the optimal 7%, there can be high variability in the HbA1c&#xD;
      measures (large standard deviation) that may still lead to complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes to gather data to determine whether different treatment thresholds for&#xD;
      diabetes in Qatar people have inherently different effects on the variability of HbA1c on a&#xD;
      month-to-month basis. By establishing an understanding of how different treatment regimens&#xD;
      for hyperglycemia may affect HbA1c variability, this study would then inform on a long term&#xD;
      study designed to determine whether interventions to reduce HbA1c variability can reduce&#xD;
      micro- or macrovascular complication risk independently of mean HbA1c. If proven, this&#xD;
      concept would allow patients to help avoid glycaemia-related vascular complications without&#xD;
      having the high potential risk of hypoglycemia that is associated with the current gold&#xD;
      standard of diabetes care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to recruit 150 patients on any glucose lowering medication (HbA1c&#xD;
      7.5-9%), randomize them into one of two treatment threshold groups and test their HbA1c every&#xD;
      6 weeks for 20 visits (visit 1 baseline; therefore 114 weeks) to assess the HbA1c variability&#xD;
      of each group. Self-monitored fasting plasma glucose (FPG) measurement will be undertaken 3&#xD;
      times weekly and reported back to the medical team as part of the safety monitoring. Patients&#xD;
      will be randomly divided into 2 treatment thresholds. In one the investigators will intensify&#xD;
      treatment in those with FPG&gt;140mg/dl until their FPG is &lt;90mg/dl, using whatever treatment is&#xD;
      clinically appropriate for them, and only intensify it further if their FPG rises to&#xD;
      &gt;140mg/dl again. In the other group Investigators will intensify if their FPG is &gt;115 mg/dl&#xD;
      until it is &lt;=115 mg/dl and intensify further if &gt;115 mg/dl again. As such the study will be&#xD;
      treatment threshold dependent and therapy independent. This will help circumvent any concern&#xD;
      that the drug regimen could complicate the analysis or present a confounder. In practical&#xD;
      terms it means the investigators give both groups of patients the same therapy that is&#xD;
      intensified according to the treatment threshold with the addition of the same hypoglycemic&#xD;
      agents as used in routine clinical practice. Intensifying treatment dose would be undertaken&#xD;
      if three consecutive FPG were above the target of 140 or 115 mg/dl. This will be advised by&#xD;
      the patient ringing the study coordinator and/or the study coordinator ringing the patient&#xD;
      weekly and advising the consultant what the FPG values are for action. It is anticipated that&#xD;
      the mean HbA1c will be comparable but the variability of the HbA1c will differ between the 2&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole blood samples taken from the recruited patients will be freshly analyzed in a&#xD;
      biochemical and HbA1c analyzer. Following this the samples and an aliquot of haemolysate will&#xD;
      be stored at -80C for 2-3 years (the duration of the study), when they will be reanalyzed at&#xD;
      the completion of the study and the results will be compared with the measurements prior to&#xD;
      storage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients entering the study will be assessed by a dietician at Hamad hospital and advised&#xD;
      how to complete the food frequency questionnaire that was devised for an Arab population and&#xD;
      based on EPIC. It will be completed every six weeks at the time that the HbA1c is taken.&#xD;
      Patients will also be asked to fill in the WHO Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (G-PAQ)&#xD;
      that has been translated into Arabic and will be collected on a six weekly basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of the serum lipids (total cholesterol, HDL), inflammatory marker (hsCRP) will be&#xD;
      undertaken every 6 weeks when the HbA1c is measured. Twenty four hour urinary oxidative&#xD;
      stress (urinary isoprostanes by LC/MS) will be measured at baseline, 12 and 24 months. These&#xD;
      measures may provide some insight on the mechanism by which HbA1c variability may alter&#xD;
      microvascular and macrovascular risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures for microvascular complications have been included and these include&#xD;
      albumin/creatinine ratio and eGFR that will be undertaken every 4 months as a measure for&#xD;
      nephropathy. For neuropathy, autonomic function testing using deep breathing heart rate&#xD;
      variability, corneal nerve fiber density (CNFD), a sensitive measure of small fiber&#xD;
      neuropathy will be performed at baseline, 12 and 24 months under the expertise of Professor&#xD;
      Malik who has established the techniques here in Doha.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of the patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only Qatari patients will be recruited and the investigators will aim to recruit a gender&#xD;
      balance that reflects that of the local eligible diabetes patients until 150 are recruited&#xD;
      aged 18-65 years of age. Patients can be on any treatment including insulin as the study is&#xD;
      aiming to look at treatment thresholds, rather than actual treatments. This would mean that&#xD;
      patients might have additional medication added or substituted in order to reach the&#xD;
      necessary threshold of the study. Patients who may be suitable will be given an information&#xD;
      sheet detailing the study and asked to contact the designated coordinator within 2 days.&#xD;
      After informed consent that will follow&quot;HRP-803 and HRP-802 INVESTIGATOR GUIDANCE -&#xD;
      Documentation of Informed Consent&quot;, taken by the study coordinator, subjects will be screened&#xD;
      against the inclusion and exclusion criteria for eligibility. Should the patient be suitable&#xD;
      for inclusion in the study then blood will be withdrawn for HbA1c, routine biochemistry&#xD;
      including creatinine, insulin, fasting glucose, fasting lipids, blood for hsCRP and a full&#xD;
      blood count at that visit. Urinary albumin/creatinine will also be assessed. Patients would&#xD;
      be randomized at that point. Patients will either attend the clinic or have the study&#xD;
      coordinator visit their home every 6 weeks to take blood for HbA1c, routine biochemistry&#xD;
      including eGFR, lipids, and hsCRP. Urine for urinary isoprostanes will be taken as a measure&#xD;
      of oxidative stress. Urinary albumin/creatinine will also be assessed. This will be&#xD;
      undertaken for the 20 study visits to assess their HbA1c variability on their two treatment&#xD;
      thresholds. A fasting insulin and glucose will be taken at the beginning, at week 60 and at&#xD;
      the end of the study as a measure of insulin resistance (HOMA) to determine if there has been&#xD;
      a change in insulin resistance over the course of the study. Sex hormone binding globulin&#xD;
      (SHBG) as an indirect measure of insulin resistance will also be taken in the event that the&#xD;
      fasting bloods cannot be obtained. Assessment of retinopathy by an ophthalmologist and&#xD;
      neuropathy will be undertaken at the beginning, mid point and end of the study that fits with&#xD;
      current clinical practice. Renal function will be determined every 6 weeks throughout the&#xD;
      study by monitoring GFR and measuring urinary albumin/creatinine. Urinary isoprostanes will&#xD;
      be measured using LC/MS in a validated assay that is currently in use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autonomic function testing using deep breathing heart rate variability, and a sensitive&#xD;
      measure of small fiber neuropathy using corneal confocal microscopy to quantify corneal nerve&#xD;
      fiber density (CNFD) will be performed at baseline, 12 months and at 24 months (a total of 3&#xD;
      times over the 2 year study period).&#xD;
