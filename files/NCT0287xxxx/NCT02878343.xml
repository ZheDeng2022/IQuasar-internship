      This study will evaluate the comparative effectiveness of behavioral economic financial&#xD;
      incentives and environmental strategies, separately and together, in achieving initial weight&#xD;
      loss and maintenance of weight loss, in obese employee populations. Our study contributes to&#xD;
      the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's efforts to combat obesity but in particular&#xD;
      to the Centers for Disease Control's winnable battles (physical activity and obesity); the&#xD;
      National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion's strategic priorities&#xD;
      around well-being, health equity, and evaluation and dissemination of environmental and&#xD;
      systems-wide solutions to address public health problems; and the National Center for Chronic&#xD;
      Disease Prevention and Health Promotion's domain around healthier work-site initiatives, the&#xD;
      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's efforts to improve nutrition and physical&#xD;
      activity to prevent obesity, and reduction of cardiovascular disease risk. This study is a&#xD;
      4-arm randomized controlled trial in which 344 employees of the City of Philadelphia,&#xD;
      Independence Blue Cross, and South Eastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority with initial&#xD;
      Body Mass Index of 30 will be randomized to receive one of the following: 1) Daily lottery&#xD;
      type incentives tied to achievement of weight loss goals (incentive arm); 2) individually&#xD;
      tailored environmental strategies around food intake and physical activity (environmental&#xD;
      arm); 3) a combination of incentives and environmental strategies (combined arm); or 4)&#xD;
      standard employee wellness benefits and weigh-ins every 6 months (control arm). Phase I of&#xD;
      the study (first 6 months) will focus on weight loss; Phase II (months 7-18) will focus on&#xD;
      continued weight loss or maintenance for those who choose to maintain weight loss as opposed&#xD;
      to continuing to try to lose weight; Phase III (months 19-24) will provide a period of&#xD;
      post-intervention follow-up to measure sustainability of effects.&#xD;

      Analysis Plan 11.1 Statistical Considerations Descriptive analyses We will produce data&#xD;
      summaries regularly using frequencies for categorical variables and means, medians, and&#xD;
      ranges for continuous variables. We will assess data quality and examine distributional&#xD;
      assumptions with graphical methods. To evaluate balance among groups achieved by&#xD;
      randomization, we will compare baseline values of all variables across the 4 arms using&#xD;
      appropriate tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General procedures All primary analyses will be on an intent-to-treat basis including each&#xD;
      participant in the group to which s/he was randomized, regardless of adherence to the&#xD;
      assigned strategy. Given the high rates of missing data typical of weight loss studies,&#xD;
      handling of missing data is an important issue. Primary analyses will use multiple imputation&#xD;
      for the missing in-person weight outcome at 18 months, using the randomization strata (sex,&#xD;
      employer, initial BMI), study arm and other baseline variables as predictors in the&#xD;
      imputation model. Baseline variables will include age, race, income, education, marital&#xD;
      status, household size, physical activities, eating behavior index, stages of change, SF-36&#xD;
      General Health, and baseline weight. Sensitivity analyses will be performed with imputation&#xD;
      models that also use post-baseline data, , and recent weight loss trend before drop out, as&#xD;
      well as an analysis that assumes that any participants for whom follow-up weight loss data&#xD;
      are unavailable have had their weight return to baseline (weight at beginning of Pre Phase).&#xD;
      Within each arm, this last assumption is likely to be conservative but this may not be the&#xD;
      case in inter-arm comparisons, depending on the dropout rates in the different arms and true&#xD;
      follow-up weights of the dropouts. Thus, a key secondary analysis will consider the effect of&#xD;
      differential dropout among the treatment arms. For this analysis, methods that address&#xD;
      potential patterns of MNAR may be considered in the missing data imputation, such as pattern&#xD;
      mixture models as appropriate. Finally, we will also consider a per-protocol type analysis,&#xD;
      which examines the difference in the intervention arms in the complete case data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy Analyses All hypotheses will be tested using two-sided, 0.05-level tests unless&#xD;
      otherwise specified (notably the Holm testing approach will be used for the five primary&#xD;
      hypotheses in Specific Aims 1-4). The primary analyses will be an unadjusted intent-to-treat&#xD;
      analyses, using a t-test for differences in weight change from baseline to 18 months, as&#xD;
      measured by the in-person weight, between each intervention group and the control group, and&#xD;
      the combined compared to each single intervention, applying the Holm p-value correction for&#xD;
      multiple comparisons testing. If weight change appears to be non-normally distributed in the&#xD;
      blinded data, we will find an appropriate. Missing data will be handled as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight change between baseline and 18 months, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), will be&#xD;
      estimated for comparison with adjusted analyses. We will estimate regression models adjusted&#xD;
      for the stratification variables (sex, employer, initial BMI) and other participant&#xD;
      characteristics factors including age, race, income, and education. We will evaluate the&#xD;
      evidence of confounding for other baseline variables (baseline weight, marital status,&#xD;
      household size, physical activities- i.e total minutes of MVPA+walking/week, eating behavior&#xD;
      index, stages of change, SF-36 General Health) using change in estimate criterion (10%). We&#xD;
      will fit exploratory models of the repeated weight measurements that incorporate time as a&#xD;
      polynomial function or using visit-specific indicator variables to determine the most&#xD;
      parsimonious model that adequately describes the observed patterns, as necessary. Models will&#xD;
      be built separately for the in-person and at home weight data. Models using the at-home&#xD;
      weight data would be considered only as potential exploratory analyses comparing the 3&#xD;
      intervention arms, since at-home weights are not available for the control arm. We will&#xD;
      investigate random-effects models that allow for baseline individual variability as well as&#xD;
      variability in the changes in weights over time; an example is the following: E(weightij) =&#xD;
      ß0 +ß1Timej + ß2Groupi+ ß3Xi + b0i + b1i Timej, where i indicates subject, j indicates&#xD;
      assessment times, the parameters are fixed effects linking time, a treatment group vector,&#xD;
      and a vector of other demographic or clinical covariates Xi to the outcomes, and b0i and b1i&#xD;
      are random intercept and slope effects. Tests for significance of random effects will use&#xD;
      likelihood ratio tests for nested models; we will compare models with different random&#xD;
      effects structures using the maximized log-likelihoods and the Akaike Information Criterion&#xD;
      (AIC). We will apply standard diagnostic techniques to assess model adequacy. We will use&#xD;
      treatment by time interactions to assess whether the rate of change in weight differs by&#xD;
      intervention arm. We hypothesize that incentives may be more effective among lower income&#xD;
      individuals and will evaluate this using interaction terms of income with treatment group. We&#xD;
      will explore differential effects by race and education and baseline levels of intrinsic&#xD;
      motivation and stages of change. We will also consider other potential mediators, such as the&#xD;
      home food and activity environment. To assess the sensitivity of treatment effect estimates&#xD;
      to missing data, we mayfit hierarchical or mixed effects models with and without accounting&#xD;
      for informative missing data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Specific Aim 5, we will consider appropriate methods for cost effective analysis such as&#xD;
      the models proposed below. We will assess the costs of each of the intervention arms from&#xD;
      both the employer and social perspective and compare the cost differences between each arm&#xD;
      relative to the effectiveness measured by incremental weight loss achieved. The principal&#xD;
      incremental cost-effectiveness ratios between intervention and control arms will be from the&#xD;
      employer's perspective and we will compare costs during the intervention from baseline to 18&#xD;
      months per unit change in weight. Secondary analyses may also 1) evaluate this same ratio but&#xD;
      use either 6 months post- intervention data (24 month visit) or 12 months of intervention&#xD;
      data (12 month visit) and 2) evaluate these 2 ratios using a limited social perspective. Cost&#xD;
      models will use a generalized linear model with a log link and gamma family. Missing data&#xD;
      strategies will parallel those described above. We will assess sampling uncertainty for the&#xD;
      comparison of costs and effects by calculating parametric 95% CIs for the cost per kg lost&#xD;
      and acceptability curves. Standard errors and correlation of the difference in cost and&#xD;
      effect will be derived using a bootstrap procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.2 Power and Sample Size Considerations We have designed the study with adequate power to&#xD;
      detect differences in weight loss over an 18-month period. Our intervention should achieve&#xD;
      its maximal impact in maintaining initial weight loss at the end of Phase II (month 18), when&#xD;
      the incentive payments cease. To maintain the experiment-wide Type I error and guard against&#xD;
      false conclusions of effectiveness, we will use the Holm multiple comparisons adjustment for&#xD;
      test the 5 primary comparisons in Specific Aims 1-4 . If the interventions are as effective&#xD;
      as hypothesized, the proposed sample size maintains greater than 90% power to show&#xD;
      significance for each of the three intervention arms compared to control and greater than 80%&#xD;
      power to show significance for the combined intervention group compared to each of the two&#xD;
      interventions alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to note that while we originally planned to recruit 328 participants, a small&#xD;
      subset was unable to successfully set up their Withings scales post randomization due to&#xD;
      Wi-Fi connectivity issues. Therefore, we increased our target sample size by the number of&#xD;
      people who were unable to connect their Withings scales to the Way To Health platform (16&#xD;
      additional subjects), bringing our recruitment total to 344 participants. The final&#xD;
      statistical analysis is adjusted for the stratification factors to account for any imbalances&#xD;
      that may have occurred. We have previously communicated this information to the IRB and the&#xD;
      members of the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB), who approved this approach. The&#xD;
      following information outlines our original power calculations and sample size&#xD;
      considerations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to recruit approximately one third of the participants required for the start of&#xD;
      Phase I from each of our participating employers (IBC, SEPTA, and City of Philadelphia).&#xD;
      Given the large number of potentially eligible employees, we can, if needed, easily increase&#xD;
      the proportion of participants from any of these employers to meet recruitment targets.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to our 3 intervention groups and the control group using a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio for the intervention arms. We built in a margin of 20% of our original target&#xD;
      sample size of 328 for potential attrition before the 18-month assessment, resulting in an&#xD;
      expected 260 participants (65 per arm) who are available for analysis at the end of Phase II.&#xD;
      This sample size will provide us with greater than 90% power to detect a difference in weight&#xD;
      change between baseline and the 18-month weigh-in of 5 kg between each single intervention&#xD;
      group and the control group (primary outcomes for Specific Aims 1-3) and 87% power to detect&#xD;
      a 3 kg difference between the combined group and either the incentive or environmental&#xD;
      strategies groups (Specific Aim 4). Namely, we will have greater than 85% power for the 5&#xD;
      primary comparisons of interest for an expected weight change between months 0-18 of -8 kg,&#xD;
      -5 kg and 0 kg in the combined, intervention and control groups, respectively (a net&#xD;
      difference between single intervention and control groups of 5 kg, combined intervention and&#xD;
      control groups of 8 kg, and 3kg between the single interventions and combined group) and&#xD;
      assuming a standard deviation (S.D.) of weight loss of 5 kg. We will also have greater than&#xD;
      80% power to detect a difference of 4.6 kg in weight change between single intervention and&#xD;
      control groups and 7.3 kg between the combined and control groups (primary outcomes for&#xD;
      Specific Aims 1-3), while maintaining approximately 80% power for a 2.7 kg difference between&#xD;
      the combined and each single intervention (Specific Aim 4). For our secondary outcomes&#xD;
      (Specific Aim 5), we wish to compare the cost differences between each arm relative to the&#xD;
      effectiveness measured by incremental weight loss achieved. We will calculate a point&#xD;
      estimate of cost per kg of weight loss based on estimated inter-arm differences in weight&#xD;
      loss and the incremental cost of the interventions, as described in C.3.d.ii.c. For weight&#xD;
      loss at 18 months, given an expected incremental cost of $810 (incentives) and incremental&#xD;
      weight loss of 5 kg, 328 participants provide 80% power to detect a cost per kg lost of $430&#xD;
      and greater than 90% power to detect a cost per kg lost of $575. This study is primarily a&#xD;
      test of the efficacy of these interventions. Due to resource constraints and because we do&#xD;
      not yet know about intervention effectiveness, we did not power this study based on cost&#xD;
      effectiveness analyses. Estimated detectable costs per kg are a function of wide confidence&#xD;
      intervals due to sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.3 Measurement of effect: The goal of this analysis will be to assess relative weight loss&#xD;
      in the intervention arms relative to control. For the principal cost-effectiveness analysis,&#xD;
      measurement of incremental weight loss will be based on differences in weight between&#xD;
      baseline and the 18 month visit; in secondary analyses it will be based on weight differences&#xD;
      between baseline and 24 months and baseline and 12 months.&#xD;
