    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab works in treating patients with epidermal&#xD;
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant non-small cell lung cancer that have not received prior&#xD;
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy and has spread to other places in the body. Monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may block growth in different ways by targeting certain&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine efficacy (objective response rate (ORR)) of front-line pembrolizumab for&#xD;
      metastatic EGFR mutation positive programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1)+ (&gt; 1% by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry [IHC]) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine safety (adverse event tabulation and grading) of front-line pembrolizumab for&#xD;
      metastatic EGFR mutation positive PD-L1+ (&gt; 1% by IHC) NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine efficacy (progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS)) of front-line&#xD;
      pembrolizumab for metastatic EGFR mutation positive PD-L1+ (&gt;1% by IHC) NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine ORR, PFS and OS of subsequent EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy in&#xD;
      patients with EGFR-sensitizing mutation after pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Analyze tumor tissue biomarkers for potential correlation with response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 3 weeks for up to 35 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up at 3 and 6 months, and&#xD;
      then every 9 weeks thereafter.&#xD;

          <title>Efficacy (Progression Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS)) Assessed by RECIST 1.1</title>
          <description>Will evaluate Progression Free Survival and Overall Survival. Average of Progression Free Survival recorded for limited number of subjects analyzed. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions</description>
          <population>Participants analyzed is 10 because although 11 patients were treated, forensic analysis revealed that 1 subject did not have documented EGFR mutation. Regarding Overall Survival, median OS was not reached at time of data cutoff.</population>
