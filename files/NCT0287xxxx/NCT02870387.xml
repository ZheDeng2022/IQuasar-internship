      The investigators will conduct a pilot quality improvement trial to assess the impact of&#xD;
      offering inpatient consultation to further optimize coordination and improve care for&#xD;
      high-risk chronically ill children receiving comprehensive care in an enhanced medical home.&#xD;

      Background and Rationale: Comprehensive care (CC) provided in the High-Risk Children's Clinic&#xD;
      (HRCC) at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth) involves care&#xD;
      for acute and chronic conditions from a team of ethnically diverse pediatricians and nurse&#xD;
      practitioners who are highly trained and experienced in treating medically complex and&#xD;
      fragile children. This clinic serves as a novel medical home where both primary and specialty&#xD;
      services are provided in the same place at the same visit. Acute problems presenting before 4&#xD;
      pm are seen the same day or if they occur over the weekend, on Monday morning. All parents&#xD;
      have the cell phone number to directly reach 1 of the primary care clinicians at all hours.&#xD;
      Multiple measures are used to promote and ensure the highest quality of care such as daily&#xD;
      checks of emergency department and hospital logs to ensure prompt follow-up and coordination&#xD;
      of care, weekly HRCC provider team meetings to review the care provided before every ED visit&#xD;
      and hospitalization, high priority given to minimizing unnecessary ED visits and&#xD;
      hospitalizations, and a relatively low patient-to-staff ratio of no greater than 100 (to&#xD;
      allow for longer clinic visits, more telephone calls and e-mails, and extensive quality&#xD;
      improvement measures).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comprehensive care undoubtedly increases access to high-quality healthcare for high-risk&#xD;
      disadvantaged children. The findings of our previous randomized trial of comprehensive care&#xD;
      vs. usual care that were given accelerated publication in JAMA (2014) have attracted national&#xD;
      attention as the best evidence to date supporting medical homes to reduce either adverse&#xD;
      outcomes or costs (Mosquera et al., 2014). Comprehensive care resulted in major benefits (ED&#xD;
      visits, hospital admissions &amp; days, pediatric ICU admissions &amp; days were all reduced by&#xD;
      47-69%) and savings of &gt;$10,000/child/year from the health system perspective. Indeed, the&#xD;
      improvements in outcomes and reduction in costs exceed those previously reported in prior&#xD;
      studies of medical homes for patients of any age or condition (Mosquera et al., 2014; Homer&#xD;
      et al., 2008; Jackson et al., 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these demonstrated benefits, high-risk patients seen in the High-Risk Children's&#xD;
      Clinic still experience high rates of morbidity and often require hospitalization for&#xD;
      treatment of acute exacerbations of their underlying chronic conditions. In 2015, 100 HRCC&#xD;
      patients experienced a total of 175 admissions at Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital (CMHH)&#xD;
      for a mean length of stay (LOS) of 7.1 days. As a result, a pilot quality improvement (QI)&#xD;
      trial will be conducted to assess the impact of offering inpatient consultation (IC) at CMHH&#xD;
      to further optimize coordination and integration of inpatient and outpatient care and reduce&#xD;
      total hospital days per child-year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion/Exclusion criteria: HRCC patients who require admission to CMHH will be included in&#xD;
      the pilot trial. HRCC patients ≥ 18 years of age at study initiation will be excluded from&#xD;
      the pilot trial and so will those with a Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) order, unrepaired&#xD;
      congenital heart disease, active cancer, mitochondrial disorder, or seen in the HRCC clinic&#xD;
      solely for compassionate care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment period: All eligible HRCC patients who are admitted to CMHH between October 3,&#xD;
      2016 and October 2, 2019 will be enrolled in the pilot trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: All eligible HRCC patients will be randomized prior to study enrollment to either&#xD;
      usual inpatient care or comprehensive care with inpatient consultation utilizing a&#xD;
      computer-generated algorithm with variable block sizes. Patients will be stratified into two&#xD;
      groups according to whether or not they are considered to have greater than median risk of&#xD;
      repeated hospitalizations for patients in this study. Baseline hospitalization risk&#xD;
      (high-risk or very high-risk) will be determined by the clinic's medical director based on&#xD;
      the patient's diagnosis and clinical course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual Inpatient Care: Inpatient care at CMHH will be provided by the hospital inpatient team&#xD;
      (residents, fellows, and attending faculty physicians) with usual occasional communication&#xD;
      with HRCC providers. This care will not be modified by the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comprehensive care with Inpatient Consultation: Inpatient care at CMHH will include inpatient&#xD;
      consultation by HRCC providers with input and recommendations conveyed to the hospital&#xD;
      inpatient team on admission and at discharge at a minimum. The HRCC providers will review the&#xD;
      inpatient care plan and make treatment and discharge recommendations with a focus on&#xD;
      coordination and integration of inpatient and outpatient care. The inpatient consultations&#xD;
      will consist of either face-to-face consultations, non-face-to-face consultations, or a phone&#xD;
      call to the inpatient physician team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection and Management: Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) software will be&#xD;
      utilized to collect and manage predefined study variable data. REDCap is a secure, web-based&#xD;
      application designed to support electronic data capture for research studies providing: 1) an&#xD;
      intuitive interface for validated data entry; 2) audit trails for tracking data manipulation&#xD;
      and export procedures; 3) automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to common&#xD;
      statistical packages; and 4) procedures for importing data from external sources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost Assessment: Total hospital costs for CMHH admission and any ER visit or re-admission&#xD;
      within 30 days after CMHH discharge will be assessed from a health system perspective by&#xD;
      multiplying total hospital charges by department-specific cost-to-charge ratios specified in&#xD;
      the hospital's annual Medicare cost report. Hospital costs for the comprehensive care with&#xD;
      inpatient consultation group will be augmented by the incremental HRCC personnel cost for&#xD;
      providing inpatient consultation based on the HRCC staff salary and fringe data. All costs&#xD;
      will be inflated to the year of analysis based on the Consumer Price Index for medical&#xD;
      services. The investigators will consider the program to be highly cost-effective if it&#xD;
      reduces the total number of hospital days per child-year without increasing costs, reduces&#xD;
      costs without increasing the total number of hospital days per child-year, or reduces both.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical and Economic Analyses: All intent-to-treat statistical and economic analyses will&#xD;
      be performed using multilevel generalized estimating equations (GEE) models with exchangeable&#xD;
      correlation to account for patient and family clustering, robust standard errors, and log&#xD;
      link. The economic analyses will be performed according to current standards for such&#xD;
      analyses (Drummond et al., 2005; Gold et al., 1996; Siegel et al., 1996; Sanders et al.,&#xD;
      2016). Differences in hospital days and costs between treatment groups will be assessed using&#xD;
      GEE models with gamma distribution. Rates of secondary outcomes will be assessed using&#xD;
      binomial GEE models, whereas total number of secondary outcomes will be assessed with&#xD;
      negative binomial GEE models. All the models will be adjusted for the trial's stratifying&#xD;
      variable (baseline risk of repeated hospitalization) and for within-family correlation. In&#xD;
      this small pilot study, some treatment effects that would be considered important by family&#xD;
      members and clinicians (reduced hospital days) may not be statistically significant. As a&#xD;
      result, Bayesian analyses will also be performed to estimate the probability of a benefit of&#xD;
      a given magnitude and evaluate whether further study is justified. Neutral and skeptical&#xD;
      priors will be used. The study will also allow us to obtain the experience and data needed to&#xD;
      refine the process for providing inpatient consultations for high-risk chronically ill&#xD;
      children. All frequentist statistical analyses will be performed using Stata version 13.1&#xD;
      (Stata Corp, College Station, TX). The Bayesian model will be implemented using OpenBUGS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stopping Rules. We plan to enroll patients in the pilot trial for 3 years. However, under&#xD;
      predefined stopping rules, enrollment will cease if Bayesian analyses performed at the end of&#xD;
      the first year identifies a 97.5% or greater probability that inpatient consultation results&#xD;
      in at least a 10% reduction in the total number of hospital days per child-year relative to&#xD;
      usual inpatient care or if at the end of the second year it identifies a 95% or greater&#xD;
      probability of such a reduction.&#xD;
