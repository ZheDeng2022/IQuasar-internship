  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to randomize 320 (160 Caucasian, 160 African American) socially isolated&#xD;
      adults 75+ years old (50:50 split between those with normal cognition and mild cognitive&#xD;
      impairment (MCI)) recruited from the community to either the Video Chat Group or the Control&#xD;
      Group. The participants in the Video Chat Group will receive a computer and internet service&#xD;
      for the duration of the study, which they will use to video chat with study staff for 30&#xD;
      minutes/day 4x/week for 6 months (high dose), and then 2x/week for an additional 6 months&#xD;
      (maintenance dose). The efficacy examination of the maintenance dose is limited to an&#xD;
      exploratory aim. Both intervention and control groups will have a brief (about 10 minutes)&#xD;
      telephone check-in with study staff once per week. In-home testing will occur at Baseline and&#xD;
      6 months. A sub-sample of participants** will be assessed at 12 months (exploratory) after&#xD;
      additional 6 months of maintenance dose. All participants at OHSU will have their medication&#xD;
      compliance tracked using an electronic medication monitoring device and participants at both&#xD;
      OHSU and UM will have MRIs at Baseline and 6 months, if they are able to safely receive MRIs.&#xD;
      Participants at both sites will contribute saliva for genetic testing (optional consent), and&#xD;
      all video chat and neuropsychological assessment sessions will be recorded for speech and&#xD;
      language analysis (consent required for participation).&#xD;

    <description>Participants engage in 30-minute face-to-face communications with study staff through internet/webcam 4 times per week for 24 weeks (6 months). Under an exploratory aim, a limited number of participants will be further followed by sustaining dose of 2 times per week of 30 minutes session for additional 24 weeks (6 months). Conversational staff will facilitate content-standardized but naturalistic-style social engagement. Staff and participants will engage in conversation about a wide variety of topics that are culturally and personally relevant and interesting to participants. Each day, participants will be able to choose from topic options. Participants will also receive a phone call once per week that lasts approximately 10 minutes; interviewers ask brief questions to monitor participant social activities and health conditions.</description>
