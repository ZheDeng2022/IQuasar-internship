  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether amnion membrane grafts are more effective&#xD;
      than another tissue engineered skin substitute, when used to treat diabetic foot ulcers&#xD;
      (DFUs).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes affects at least 9% of the population, or approximately 29 million people in the&#xD;
      United States. Lower extremity ulcers are a serious complication for people with diabetes.&#xD;
      Diabetic foot-related problems are the most frequent cause of hospitalization within this&#xD;
      group and it is estimated that the total cost for treatment ranges from $10,000 to nearly&#xD;
      $60,000 depending on ulcer severity and clinical outcomes. While many diabetic foot ulcers&#xD;
      are superficial and can heal with conservative treatment, many are more severe and&#xD;
      recalcitrant to standard of care (SOC). About a quarter of individuals with diabetes will&#xD;
      develop a chronic non-healing ulcer over their lifetime and nearly 60 of every 10,000&#xD;
      individuals with diabetes will undergo a lower extremity amputation. Holzer and associates&#xD;
      conducted a retrospective analysis of the costs for lower extremity ulcers in patients with&#xD;
      diabetes and concluded that, given the high costs associated with treating these ulcers, the&#xD;
      development of better treatment strategies is warranted. One such development in the&#xD;
      treatment of chronic wounds is the use of amniotic membrane grafts. These materials have been&#xD;
      used successfully for many years in the treatment of orthopedic, plastic/reconstructive, and&#xD;
      urological applications. Initial studies have demonstrated the great success of amnionic&#xD;
      membrane graft in the healing of chronic diabetic foot ulcers and it is believed that these&#xD;
      grafts may be superior to older, more common skin substitutes.&#xD;
