      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SEER database collects data about people with cancer. SEER stands for Surveillance,&#xD;
      Epidemiology, and End Results. Medicaid is a kind of health insurance. It is for people who&#xD;
      have low income or serious medical needs. Many studies have shown that Medicaid recipients&#xD;
      with cancer are more likely to be diagnosed later in the disease than people with other&#xD;
      insurance. They are also less likely to get treatment. Researchers want to compare Medicaid&#xD;
      data and SEER data. They want to make this available to other scientists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To link people in the SEER database to Medicaid data for the years around their cancer&#xD;
      diagnosis. To create a file that contains SEER case numbers linked to Medicaid numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No people are enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SEER finder file will be securely uploaded to the CMS Data Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The finder file will be matched against the Medicaid Personal Summary file at the CMS Data&#xD;
      Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants appear in both the SEER file and Medicaid file, their data will be extracted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dates of Medicaid data will be compared with the SEER date of diagnosis. Researchers will&#xD;
      see if the Medicaid dates fall in certain periods. These are 12 months before, the month of,&#xD;
      and 11 months after diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants are eligible for Medicaid for these periods, a flag will be created in the&#xD;
      file. It will note the participants is eligible and why.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SEER finder file will be destroyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only data saved will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant's unique random SEER case number linked to their Medicaid number&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monthly flags about Medicaid eligibility&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Numerous studies have demonstrated that Medicaid recipients with cancer are more likely to be&#xD;
      diagnosed at an advance stage and less likely to receive recommended treatment than are&#xD;
      patients with other types of health insurance. The objective of this project is to link&#xD;
      persons included in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data to Medicaid&#xD;
      enrollment information during the year before and after their cancer diagnosis. NCI is also&#xD;
      seeking permission to create and maintain a file that crosswalks each patient's SEER case&#xD;
      number to their Medicaid enrollment number. Information about Medicaid enrollment would be&#xD;
      available by special request to all researchers who want to use SEER data to assess the&#xD;
      impact of Medicaid enrollment on stage and treatment.&#xD;
