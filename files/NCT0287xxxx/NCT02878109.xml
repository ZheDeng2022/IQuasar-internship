      This study is conducted to evaluate dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI to quantify the efficacy of&#xD;
      trans-arterial chemoembolization by comparing imaging results before and after treatment for&#xD;
      at least one hepatic tumor and to look at blow flow curves of the free-breathing MRI before&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background: Liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide.&#xD;
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) typically presents arterial phase hyperenhancement. For&#xD;
      intermediate stage disease and the majority of patients not eligible for curative therapies,&#xD;
      transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is considered as the first-line palliative treatment&#xD;
      in eligible patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite its efficacy on HCC, TACE presents major challenges such as the lack of quantitative&#xD;
      biomarkers of treatment response. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) enables&#xD;
      quantitative assessment of tumor and tissue enhancement, by acquiring MR signal intensity as&#xD;
      a function of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: This study is conducted: 1) to develop a monitoring system based on quantifiable&#xD;
      measures during intra-arterial treatments from dynamic MRI, using time-activity curves&#xD;
      analyzed using a dual-input dual-compartment model, and 2) to look at blood flow curves of&#xD;
      the MRI before the treatment, if any, for at least one tumor, without requiring any breath&#xD;
      hold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-treatment phase group: This will be a prospective study in HCC patients undergoing&#xD;
           TACE (including DC beads) according to their clinical standard of care. A 4D-THRIVE&#xD;
           sequence will be performed. Single intensities before/after gadolinium-based contrast&#xD;
           agent enhancement will be used to create time-concentration curves, which will be fitted&#xD;
           to a simple perfusion model that accounts for the dual blood supply of the liver through&#xD;
           the hepatic artery and the portal vein. Perfusion parameters of arterial hepatic blood&#xD;
           flow, portal venous hepatic blood flow, total hepatic blood flow and arterial fraction&#xD;
           will be extracted from the model and compared between HCC and surrounding cirrhotic&#xD;
           liver. When deemed necessary, a CBCT can be acquired before chemo-embolization in way to&#xD;
           see that the appropriate artery is selected for the treatment. The CBCT will be used&#xD;
           when available to determine the parameters of the blood flow obtained with our model.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-treatment phase group: This will be a prospective study in HCC patients undergoing a&#xD;
           MRI according to their clinical standard of care. A 4D-THRIVE sequence will be&#xD;
           performed. Single intensities before/after gadolinium-based contrast agent enhancement&#xD;
           will be used to create time-concentration curves, which will be fitted to a simple&#xD;
           perfusion model that accounts for the dual blood supply of the liver through the hepatic&#xD;
           artery and the portal vein. Perfusion parameters of arterial hepatic blood flow, portal&#xD;
           venous hepatic blood flow, total hepatic blood flow and arterial fraction will be&#xD;
           extracted from the model and compared between HCC and surrounding cirrhotic liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison: A comparison between the blood flow curves between the post-treatment phase&#xD;
           group [apnea] and the pre-treatment phase group [free-breathing] will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Forty patients will be selected. For twenty-nine of them [post-treatment phase&#xD;
      group], a 4D-THRIVE sequence will be acquired within 2 weeks prior to TACE and between 6 and&#xD;
      8 weeks after TACE. A 4D-FLOW MRI sequence will also be included. For the remaining eleven&#xD;
      patients [pre-treatment phase group], only a 4D-THRIVE sequence will be acquired within 2&#xD;
      weeks prior to treatment, if any, including a 4D-FLOW MRI sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: The results of this study will provide quantitative DCE-MRI biomarkers for&#xD;
      identification of viable tumor and tumor response. In addition, presence of increased %&#xD;
      arterial flow and decreased portal venous flow in HCC using DCE-MRI are expected to help to&#xD;
      assess treatment response.&#xD;
