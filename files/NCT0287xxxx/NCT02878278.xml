      1. To compare the therapeutic effects, safety and the corresponding pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
           pharmacodynamics between two different method of drug administration: 10mg, daily and&#xD;
           30mg/d, twice every week, and find out the more effect way of Chidamide administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine whether Chidamide could activate EB virus, and whether the above two&#xD;
           different ways of administration are different in EB virus activation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, Chidamide is taken twice a week, this comes from cell experiment and phase I&#xD;
      clinical trial, which showed that the de-acetylation effect of Chidamide could last for 72&#xD;
      hours after administration. However, daily administration of Chidamide may create a more&#xD;
      steady Chidamide concentration, thus improve the de-acetylation effect of Chidamide, so it's&#xD;
      necessary to compare the two different ways of administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current study showed that Romidepsin, a HDACI, could activate EBV during the treatment of&#xD;
      NKTCL, whether Chidamide, as a novel HDACI, could activate EBV is still not clear, so this&#xD;
      problem is worth to be accessed.&#xD;
