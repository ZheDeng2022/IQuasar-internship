      REMMITE, a retrospective and prospective registry with one-year follow-up, will provide&#xD;
      valuable insights into the clinical diagnosis, management, treatment trends as well as&#xD;
      related outcomes of three cohorts: DVT, DVT-PE, PE patients throughout many regions of Mexico&#xD;
      and through different health care systems.&#xD;

      Introduction Venous thromboembolism disease, (VTE) comprises deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and&#xD;
      pulmonary embolism (PE). In United States, incidence has remained relatively constant. In&#xD;
      Mexico, annual incidence is unknown. In spite of technological and risk stratification&#xD;
      advances, it is still the third cause of cardiovascular and pulmonary disease. Presentation&#xD;
      of PE is quite heterogeneous. As a complex disease with highly variable presentations in&#xD;
      different clinical settings, DVT-PE can be confronted and managed by cardiologists,&#xD;
      pneumologists, intensive care, internal medicine, emergency, orthopedics and surgery&#xD;
      physicians. Thus, initial clinical approach and results can vary depending on attending&#xD;
      physicians, experience and hospital infrastructure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mainstay of VTE treatment is anticoagulation, either systemic or oral. PE management,&#xD;
      however, varies widely, depending on patient presentation but substantially on hemodynamic&#xD;
      consequences based of right ventricle (RV) dysfunction. A careful clinical history and&#xD;
      physical examination, integrated to electrocardiographic, laboratory and appropriate imaging&#xD;
      findings could help to risk stratification in order to proceed to a treatment. Though some&#xD;
      patients present with clear hemodynamic compromise, others may have an incidentally diagnosis&#xD;
      while a test is performed for a different reason. Scoring systems can identify patients at&#xD;
      different levels of risk. Registries may help to get key findings to quantify clinical&#xD;
      characteristics, electrocardiographic, laboratory and modality imaging as well as treatment&#xD;
      trends and clinical outcomes in the real world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of the REMMITE, a retrospective and prospective registry with one-year follow-up,&#xD;
      will provide valuable insights into the clinical diagnosis, management, treatment trends as&#xD;
      well as related outcomes. The REMMITE has the potential to dictate guidelines and&#xD;
      recommendations based on identified deficits and good practices among participating centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REMMITE design Primary objective: to identify clinical characteristics, treatment trends,&#xD;
      in-hospital and 12 months follow-up outcome through major adverse cardiovascular events&#xD;
      (MACE) of patients diagnosed either with DVT, DVT-PE, or PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables to be included In all patients: a) demographic data, b) date of onset of symptoms,&#xD;
      c) past medical history, d) physical examination e) electrocardiographic, f) laboratory and&#xD;
      g) imaging findings, h) treatment in acute phase, i) in-hospital and follow - up outcome, j)&#xD;
      treatment during follow-up, k) MACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective cases enrollment Patients with a history of DVT, DVT-PE, PE in the last year&#xD;
      will be enrolled. In all patients: a) demographic data, b) date of onset of symptoms, c) past&#xD;
      medical history, d) physical examination e) electrocardiographic, f) laboratory and g)&#xD;
      imaging findings, h) treatment in acute phase, i) in-hospital and follow - up outcome, j)&#xD;
      treatment during follow-up, in patients under oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists&#xD;
      International Normalized Ratio (INR) will be recorded; k) percentage of patients with&#xD;
      non-vitamin K antagonist (NOAC´s) during following) l) MACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective cases enrollment Patients with an acute episode of DVT, DVT-PE, PE will be&#xD;
      enrolled. In all patients: a) demographic data, b) date of onset of symptoms, c) past medical&#xD;
      history, d) physical examination e) electrocardiographic, f) laboratory and g) imaging&#xD;
      findings, h) treatment in acute phase, i) in-hospital and follow - up outcome, j) treatment&#xD;
      during follow-up,( in patients under oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists INR will&#xD;
      be recorded;) k) patients receiving (NOAC´s) drugs at discharge, l) percentage of patients&#xD;
      with NOAC´s during following, m) MACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sites Centers with investigators with expertise in diagnosis, stratification and treatment of&#xD;
      patients with DVT, DVT-PE, PE will be involved. Also, Centers without expertise, but with&#xD;
      facilities to diagnosis and treatment and real interest in enrolling will be included, as&#xD;
      long as they accomplish with protocol requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality Criteria Following criteria will be used to guarantee quality data: a) electronic,&#xD;
      simple and accessible data collection, back-upped by clinical file, b) participate in a assay&#xD;
      filling to be familiar with electronic data collection, c) standardized definitions, data and&#xD;
      reports; d) meetings among principal investigators and steering committee at least once a&#xD;
      year; e) ethics procedures review; f) rigorous center selection based on investigators&#xD;
      expertise and/or facilities resources); g) consecutive patients enrollment to obtain&#xD;
      representative sample; h) random centers audit; i) centralized data and statistical analysis;&#xD;
      j) report all data and consistent conclusion; and k) transparency of funds for any&#xD;
      publication. Also, a way to qualify quality of this registry will be measured by the number&#xD;
      of publications and presentations in national and international meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Electronic database will have specific variables such as: date of onset&#xD;
      symptoms, medical history, personal history, physical examination, electrocardiographic,&#xD;
      chest x-Ray, echocardiogram, V/Q lung scan, magnetic resonance imaging, chest computed&#xD;
      tomography, pulmonary angiography, right heart catheterization, venous ultrasound,&#xD;
      biomarkers, treatment either pharmacologic or percutaneous, and MACE.&#xD;
