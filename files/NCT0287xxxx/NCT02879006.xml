  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is testing the use E-B-FAHF-2 Chinese herbal therapy in combination&#xD;
      with multi-food oral immunotherapy (OIT) and Xolair速 (Omalizumab) to help children and adults&#xD;
      who are allergic to foods be able to safely tolerate food allergens. Specifically in this&#xD;
      protocol, the food allergens are milk, egg, peanut, almond, cashew, hazelnut, walnut, sesame,&#xD;
      and/or wheat. Omalizumab is considered an investigational drug for the treatment of food&#xD;
      allergies in children and adults. Investigational means it has not been approved by the Food&#xD;
      and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the U.S. The researchers hope to learn whether the&#xD;
      addition of Chinese herbal therapy (E-B-FAHF-2) can improve the outcome of sustained&#xD;
      unresponsiveness (which is the ability to consume a food allergen and pass an oral food&#xD;
      challenge after being off treatment for 3 months) as compared to placebo (i.e. subjects with&#xD;
      OIT/Omalizumab + herbal vs. OIT/Omalizumab + placebo), and will help adults and children be&#xD;
      able to safely ingest the foods they are allergic to.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior studies have shown that this Chinese herbal formulation is safe and well-tolerated in&#xD;
      food allergic individuals. While oral immunotherapy (OIT) can lead to desensitization, it&#xD;
      remains uncertain whether this treatment can lead to lasting protection. Therefore, this&#xD;
      study aims to use the Chinese herbal formula in combination with OIT to determine whether&#xD;
      sustained protection can be achieved. All subjects will receive multi-allergen OIT, along&#xD;
      with a 4 month course of omalizumab to provide added safety for the initial dose escalation&#xD;
      and build up phases. Subjects will be randomized to receive active Chinese herbal formula or&#xD;
      placebo. Subjects will be treated with OIT for 2 years and then food challenges will be&#xD;
      performed to assess for desensitization. For those who achieve desensitization, all&#xD;
      treatments will be discontinued and food challenges will be performed 3 months later to&#xD;
      assess for sustained unresponsiveness.&#xD;
