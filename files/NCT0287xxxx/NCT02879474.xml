      State of the question Over the past decade, the incidence of melanoma (MM) has steadily&#xD;
      increased in France and in most developed countries. This increased incidence was concerned&#xD;
      mainly MM thin while the incidence of MM thick that represent the true &quot;killers&quot;, and&#xD;
      mortality from MM remained stable or increased slightly over the same period. These&#xD;
      epidemiological data and observations from everyday medical practice dermatologists suggest&#xD;
      the existence of different growth patterns within MM. Indeed, some MM progressing slowly&#xD;
      sometimes for decades before diagnosis but are thin at the time of resection. Conversely,&#xD;
      others MM grow very quickly, resulting in thick tumors despite a diagnosis and resection&#xD;
      sometimes very early. These fast growing MM (FGMM) probably contribute significantly to the&#xD;
      relative mortality in MM, as improved screening failed to influence to this day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our team has already demonstrated that the growth kinetics of the MM was a prognostic factor&#xD;
      of tumor aggressiveness regardless of the thickness of the tumor. Using the same method to&#xD;
      calculate the growth rate, an Australian team recently studied the growth rate in a&#xD;
      population of patients suffering from MM. In this population 1/3 of MM had a growth of more&#xD;
      than 0.5 mm per month. Clinical aspects and FGMM of these risk factors were individuals&#xD;
      (injuries symmetrical achromic and regular occurrence among about older and low-nevi). The&#xD;
      European and Australian people are very different in particular regarding the prevention&#xD;
      policy, these results can not be extrapolated to the French population.The main objective is&#xD;
      to identify risk factors for FGMM in French propulation&#xD;
