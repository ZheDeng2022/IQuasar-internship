  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers with 207,090 new cases of breast cancer&#xD;
      and 39,840 deaths in women predicted for 2010 in the United States. Aromatase inhibitors&#xD;
      (AIs) are used as first-line adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal women with early stage&#xD;
      breast cancer. The effectiveness of current therapy is widely recognized to be compromised by&#xD;
      poor compliance because of aromatase inhibitor-associated musculoskeletal symptoms (AIMSS), a&#xD;
      syndrome that affects up to 40-50% of women who take these medications. The syndrome that was&#xD;
      not recognized during the registration trials for this class of drugs, it can lead to&#xD;
      discontinuation in up to 24% of women over 2 years. Knowledge that can be used to prevent&#xD;
      discontinuation of these important agents because of severe AIMSS is urgently needed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The NCI Division of Cancer Prevention has recognized AIMSS as a priority area for future&#xD;
      study. The symptoms are associated with a high rate of AI discontinuation and therefore&#xD;
      compromise survival outcomes at great cost to both patients and society. Very little is known&#xD;
      about AIMSS, or how to predict who is at risk for the condition, or for discontinuing therapy&#xD;
      because of the symptoms. This study will provide a basis for comprehensive assessment of risk&#xD;
      factors at the patient-reported outcomes, phenotypic, and laboratory levels. We will explore&#xD;
      the natural history of AIMSS in different ethnic populations, and will validate previously&#xD;
      reported genetic determinants of the development of AIMSS. A common problem with multicenter&#xD;
      GWAS studies of very large sample size, especially in the absence of measurable diagnostic&#xD;
      parameters, is inclusion of heterogeneous groups of patients. In addition to assessing&#xD;
      pharmacogenomic predictors, this study involves specification of a pre-defined AIMSS&#xD;
      phenotype and collection of patient-reported outcomes (PROs). As such, these data will have&#xD;
      clinical utility by clarifying the factors associated with aromatase inhibitor&#xD;
      discontinuation and thus guiding clinicians towards interventions to improve adherence.&#xD;
      Coupled with other studies, the long-term goals are to develop a gene signature that will be&#xD;
      used to better guide the selection of endocrine interventions for patients with breast&#xD;
      cancer. The underlying physiology of AIMSS remains obscure. A small exploratory case control&#xD;
      study did not find a role for commonly encountered cytokines in AIMSS. The role of estrogen&#xD;
      and estrogen metabolites remains a possible explanatory variable, as well as new cytokines&#xD;
      such as IL-17. This newly described cytokine has been implicated in disorders such as&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases, and has been specifically linked to&#xD;
      articular nociception in animal models of arthritis. AIMSS Phenotype: The large studies to&#xD;
      date of AIs (ATAC, BIG I-98, E1Z03) have been limited by the absence of a clearly defined&#xD;
      phenotype for AIMSS. Retrospective analyses have provided some information that clearly&#xD;
      cannot replace (PROs). The lack of good prospective PROs represents a major gap as a&#xD;
      well-defined phenotype is necessary in order to identify useful genomic associations. Methods&#xD;
      evaluating possible predictors such as the use of MRI of the wrists for tenosynovitis are&#xD;
      expensive and have not been definitive, and patient-reported symptoms are used and may&#xD;
      represent the most useful clinical phenotype.&#xD;
