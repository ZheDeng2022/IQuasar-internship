      This is a non-randomized, prospective, quasi-experimental study designed to assess the impact&#xD;
      of pharmacist-provided medication management on total cost of care and clinical outcomes (ie,&#xD;
      hospitalizations, emergency department visits) in a real-world clinical practice.&#xD;

      Medication Management (MTM)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication management is defined as the standard of care that ensures each patient's&#xD;
      medications, including prescription, over-the-counter, herbal products, vitamins, and&#xD;
      supplements, are individually assessed to determine the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Appropriateness of each medication for the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Effectiveness for the patient's medical conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety given the patient's co-morbidities and other medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Convenience to be taken by the patient as intended&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication management services are delivered to an individual patient and are fully&#xD;
      integrated with the health care team to achieve coordinated and consistent patient care.&#xD;
      Pharmacists provide this service using a standardized method to comprehensively review each&#xD;
      patient's medications. This systematic process is designed to identify, prevent, and resolve&#xD;
      drug therapy problems and to aid in attainment of a patient's therapy goals. Medication&#xD;
      management services include an individualized care plan that tracks progress on the intended&#xD;
      goals of therapy with appropriate follow-up to determine actual patient outcomes. Pharmacists&#xD;
      aim to emphasize the care experience for patients, achieve better medication-related quality&#xD;
      measures, and reduce the cost of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are enrolled in the MTM group will have an initial MTM visit, which will last&#xD;
      approximately 60 minutes. In this visit, the patient and the pharmacist will discuss all&#xD;
      medications (prescription, over-the-counter, and herbal) that the patient is taking.&#xD;
      Medications will be evaluated for indication, efficacy, safety and convenience. The&#xD;
      pharmacist and patient and other care team members will participate in shared decision in an&#xD;
      effort to optimize patient clinical outcomes and medication experience. Patients will&#xD;
      continue to work with their primary care provider and other care team members. Patients will&#xD;
      continue to meet with the pharmacist on an individualized basis for 1 year to optimize the&#xD;
      patients' medications based on individual needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in the control group will not experience any change in their medical care&#xD;
      on account of being enrolled in the control group. They will continue to work with their&#xD;
      primary care provider and other care team members.&#xD;
