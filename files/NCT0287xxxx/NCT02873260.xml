    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the ability of a single dose of the live attenuated recombinant&#xD;
      tetravalent dengue vaccine TetraVax-DV-TV005 (referred to as TV005) to protect against&#xD;
      infection with rDEN3Δ30, an attenuated DENV-3, when administered 6 months after the TV005&#xD;
      vaccine.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dengue infection ranging from mild illness to life-threatening disease is widespread in most&#xD;
      tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Infection with any of the four serotypes of&#xD;
      dengue virus (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4) can cause dengue illness. TetraVax-DV-TV005&#xD;
      (referred to as TV005) is a live attenuated recombinant tetravalent dengue virus vaccine&#xD;
      developed to protect against all four dengue virus serotypes. This study will evaluate the&#xD;
      ability of a single dose of TV005 to protect against infection with rDEN3Δ30, a naturally&#xD;
      attenuated DENV-3, given 6 months following vaccination with TV005.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll healthy adults with no history of previous flavivirus infection. At&#xD;
      Day 0 (study entry), participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the TV005&#xD;
      vaccine or placebo. On Day 180, all participants will receive the rDEN3Δ30 virus. All&#xD;
      participants will record their temperature 3 times a day for 16 days after each vaccination.&#xD;
      Additional study visits will occur on Days 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 21, 28, 56, 90, 150, 184,&#xD;
      186, 188, 190, 192, 194, 196, 201, 208, 236, 270, and 360. Study visits will include physical&#xD;
      examinations and blood collection.&#xD;
