  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, single-arm, two-stage, Phase Ib study designed to assess&#xD;
      the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of oral cobimetinib with intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      atezolizumab and bevacizumab in participants with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) who&#xD;
      have received and progressed on at least one prior line of therapy that contained a&#xD;
      fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin or irinotecan. There are two stages in this study: Stage 1&#xD;
      (safety run-in phase) and Stage 2 (dose expansion phase with two cohorts, an expansion cohort&#xD;
      and a biopsy cohort).&#xD;

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Stage 1 Safety Run-in Phase (SRP): Approximately 12 participants will receive cobimetinib 60 milligrams (mg) orally once daily for Days 1-21 with atezolizumab 840 mg and bevacizumab 5 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) administered by IV infusion on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Atezolizumab will be administered first, followed by bevacizumab, with a minimum of 60 minutes between dosing. Upon determination of the safety and tolerability of the treatment regimen, the study will proceed to Stage 2: dose expansion phase. If the results from the safety run-in phase require dose reduction in cobimetinib, then an additional Stage 1 cohort will be opened. Treatment will continue until the participant has disease progression according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), unacceptable toxicity, death, participant or physician decision to withdraw, or pregnancy, whichever occurs first.</description>

    <description>Stage 2 Biopsy Cohort (BC): Approximately 7 evaluable participants in the biopsy cohort in expansion phase will receive bevacizumab 5 mg/kg IV on Cycle 1 Days 1 and 15 (tumor biopsy on Cycle 1 Day 8) and cobimetinib (at dose determined during safety run-in phase) orally on Cycle 1 Day 15 to Cycle 2 Day 14 (tumor biopsy on Cycle 1 Day 22). From Cycle 2 onwards, participants will follow the same treatment regimen for bevacizumab and atezolizumab (optional tumor biopsy on Cycle 2 Day 22) as those in the safety run-in phase and expansion cohort, and for cobimetinib cycles start at Day 15 and will continue 21 days to Day 7 of next cycle. Atezolizumab will be administered first, followed by bevacizumab, with a minimum of 60 minutes between dosing. Biopsies must be collected before the initiation of cobimetinib and atezolizumab. Treatment will continue until disease progression according to RECIST v1.1, unacceptable toxicity, death, decision to withdraw, or pregnancy, whichever occurs first.</description>

Atezolizumab will be administered first, followed by bevacizumab, with a minimum of 60 minutes between dosing.
