  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial is an open-label, parallel group, multicentre trial that will recruit a total of 30&#xD;
      patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. The trial will be conducted in 2 phases: a&#xD;
      non-randomised safety phase and a randomised phase. The safety phase will consist of a&#xD;
      lead-in cohort of 6 patients treated with ONCOS 102 and pemetrexed/cisplatin. The randomised&#xD;
      phase will not commence until the DSMB has deemed the safety lead-in data appropriate for&#xD;
      continuation. A total of 24 patients will be included in the randomised phase; 14 patients&#xD;
      will be randomised to receive ONCOS 102 and pemetrexed/cisplatin, and 10 patients will&#xD;
      receive pemetrexed/cisplatin alone. If cisplatin is seen to be too toxic after one or more&#xD;
      cycles, the patient may change to carboplatin during the study. Furthermore, if treatment&#xD;
      with cisplatin is deemed to be too toxic by the investigator due to age, presence of&#xD;
      neurological toxicities or other relevant medical conditions, carboplatin can be administered&#xD;
      from start of study. The trial's main objectives are determination of safety, immune&#xD;
      activation, clinical response and the correlation between clinical outcome and the&#xD;
      immunological data.&#xD;

    <description>ONCOS-102 will be administered in a priming cycle (Cycle 1) comprising injections on Days 1, 4, 8 and 36, followed by two treatment cycles at intervals of 6 weeks (Cycle 2, Day 78 and Cycle 3, Day 120). Pre-treatment with an i.v. bolus of cyclophosphamide (CPO) will be given 1 to 3 days before the first administration of ONCOS-102 (Cycle 1, Day 1) and before administration of Cycle 2 of ONCOS-102 (Day 78). Patients will also receive pemetrexed/cisplatin (carboplatin) in 21-day cycles starting on Day 22 and continuing as applicable during the study period of 6 cycles of pemetrexed/cisplatin (carboplatin) in combination with ONCOS-102.</description>

Patients will be monitored regularly for immunological assessment (PBMCs) including Month 9 and Month 12 (i.e., after the end of study visit), and will be followed up for survival every 3 months until end of life.</description>
