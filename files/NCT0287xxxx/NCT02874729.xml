  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tumour biomarkers are substances produced by cancer or by other cells of the body in response&#xD;
      to cancer conditions. They are used to help detect, diagnose, manage and predict outcome or&#xD;
      recurrence of some types of cancer. Tumour biomarkers can also help doctors choose the most&#xD;
      appropriate therapy or judge if treatment is successful. Several tumour biomarkers are&#xD;
      already used in the clinic; however, many others do not meet rigorous scientific standards to&#xD;
      enter into clinical practice and some solid cancers can be only detected using tissue biopsy,&#xD;
      a rather invasive procedure. Likewise, evaluating efficacy of novel therapies during clinical&#xD;
      trials relies on adequate and specific laboratory tests. Therefore novel biomarkers and novel&#xD;
      methods, to measure them, still represent an un-met clinical need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to develop innovative, more sensitive and reliable tests for better targets,&#xD;
      in order to assess and monitor circulating cancer biomarkers. Easily accessible samples, like&#xD;
      blood, will be tested such that invasive tissue biopsies can be avoided. Both healthy&#xD;
      individuals and cancer patients will be recruited in this study to establish if a laboratory&#xD;
      test is powerful enough to distinguish between individuals that may have cancer or not.&#xD;
      Participants' involvement will also support development of novel tests to decide if a novel&#xD;
      therapy is efficiently counteracting cancer growth or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the study will be asked to donate blood, sputum, urine or other body fluids,&#xD;
      depending on the cancer and the assay being developed. After participants give their informed&#xD;
      consent, the researchers will isolate cells, soluble factors or nucleic acids from body&#xD;
      fluids. Researchers will then use various laboratory techniques to screen cells, soluble&#xD;
      factors or nucleic acids for specific markers. This study looks at the effectiveness of using&#xD;
      laboratory tests to quantify tumour markers in body fluids and, subsequently, to monitor&#xD;
      patients' response to treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potential participants will be approached by clinical or research team members and asked&#xD;
      whether they would be interested in joining this study. Participant Information Sheet will be&#xD;
      handled and discusses with individuals, highlighting their involvement, risk and benefit of&#xD;
      this research. In particular, participation in the study will not alter any current therapies&#xD;
      of the volunteers. Having left sufficient time to decide, potential participants will be&#xD;
      asked to sign a Consent Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent, volunteers will be asked to donate blood, urine, sputum&#xD;
      (saliva) or other body fluids, like bronchoalveolar lavage, for our study, at the same time&#xD;
      other analyses are carried out as part of individuals' usual medical care. If some&#xD;
      participants are already scheduled to receive a novel drug therapy in an existing trial, we&#xD;
      may ask them to contribute with small amount of blood, saliva, urine or other body fluids,&#xD;
      twice, before and after the programmed treatment. Samples will be collected at the same time&#xD;
      as participants' routine medical examinations are carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological specimens will be collected and stored according to sample type and test&#xD;
      specifications; then separation of cellular components and soluble factors from liquid part&#xD;
      will be performed by research team members. Isolation techniques will vary based on the&#xD;
      sample source.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on the specific assay to be developed, protein content will be analysed by flow&#xD;
      cytometry, enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) or other immunoassays, including the beads-based&#xD;
      Luminex® technology. In all these laboratory techniques, the unique interaction between a&#xD;
      specific antibody and antigen enables identification of single or multiple target proteins&#xD;
      inside a complex protein mixture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flow cytometry uses fluorescence properties of some dyes to evaluate the presence of specific&#xD;
      markers on the surface or inside healthy or cancerous cells. This will help establish&#xD;
      frequency of specific cell populations or intensity of specific markers on the cells.&#xD;
      Likewise, ELISA allows qualitative and quantitative characterisation of soluble substances;&#xD;
      multiple target proteins in suspension can be evaluated with Luminex® procedure within the&#xD;
      same sample. Other biochemical techniques, such as immunoblotting can be used to determine&#xD;
      presence/ absence of proteins located either on the cell surface of or intracellularly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to proteins, nucleic acid content can be assessed, including DNA, RNA or microRNA&#xD;
      by biomolecular techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research data will be generated by these laboratory methods as software-specific files, such&#xD;
      as flow cytometry standard (FCS) files for results by flow cytometry, images and data tables.&#xD;
      Parameters like sensitivity, limit of detection and assay variability will also be evaluated&#xD;
      and reported in numeric tables. During assay development, data from both healthy donors and&#xD;
      cancer patients will be compared with standard statistical packages, in order to establish&#xD;
      robust tests that can discriminate between the two groups.&#xD;
