  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this piece of research is to assess the effect of altitude on the clinical&#xD;
      evolution of ARDS. For this purpose, patients who live and receive care at sea level are&#xD;
      compared with those who live and receive care at high altitudes. For reasons of convenience,&#xD;
      a cut-point of 1500 meters above sea level was chosen. In addition to this, it will be sought&#xD;
      to assess whether adjusting the cut-points for the severity categories of ARDS improves the&#xD;
      ability to predict some adverse events, by comparison with unadjusted cut-points. The results&#xD;
      of this research will probably be disruptive, and will provide the first information yet&#xD;
      about the effect of altitude on ARDS; they will therefore be of great interest for the&#xD;
      international scientific community and for the direct care of patients. A high bibliometric&#xD;
      impact is to be expected.&#xD;

      HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiological adaptations generated by living at high altitude modify the clinical evolution&#xD;
      of ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe the main clinical and developmental characteristics of ARDS diagnosed at&#xD;
      altitudes greater than 1500 meters above sea level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the main clinical and developmental characteristics of ARDS diagnosed at altitudes&#xD;
      greater than 1500 meters above sea level with those of cases diagnosed at altitudes below&#xD;
      1500 meters above sea level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main events:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incidence of ARDS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mortality of ARDS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay of patients with ARDS Sequelae&#xD;
      found 1 year and 3 years after diagnosis of ARDS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary events&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recognition of ARDS by clinician&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modes of mechanical ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of adjuvant therapies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: observational, prospective, cohort, multicenter, international study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment period: July 18, 2.016 - August 18, 2.016&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general organization chart of the study implies the participation of 3 lead researchers,&#xD;
      at least 1 researcher/coordinator per country, and main researchers of each service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the selection of participating services, a general invitation will be sent to all South&#xD;
      American ICUs located at altitudes greater than 1500 meters above sea level, as well as a&#xD;
      representative group of ICUs located below 1500 meters above sea level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 2 cohorts (altitude and sea level) will be generated afterwards; the size of each cohort&#xD;
      will be determined by convenience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the selection of each participating service, the exploratory form (appendix 1) will be&#xD;
      sent beforehand, in order to gain knowledge of its characteristics and possibilities; if the&#xD;
      center meets the criteria, it will be enrolled and the rest of the documents (research&#xD;
      protocols, appendices 2 and 3) will be sent to it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the participating services are defined, coordination videoconferences will be held&#xD;
      before initiation of the study; an e-mail address will be set up for general coordination.&#xD;
      All questions will be answered in less than 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be collected in an Excel spreadsheet that will be sent to the coordinator of&#xD;
      each country, and he will distribute it to the main researcher of each participating center.&#xD;
      The information will be afterwards submitted to the general coordinators via the reverse&#xD;
      pathway. All information will be sent by e-mail; in order to maintain confidentiality, the&#xD;
      spreadsheets will be encrypted. The opening codes will be known only by the researchers&#xD;
      responsible for each service, for each country, and by the lead researchers of the study. The&#xD;
      data will be included by the main researcher of each center, under supervision of the&#xD;
      coordinator of each country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1 will be the day of admission to ICU with an unadjusted Pa02/Fi02 less than 300,&#xD;
      regardless of the day the patient was admitted to hospital or to ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol implies the gathering of basic data (appendix 3), that will be further obtained&#xD;
      when the patients meets the criterion of Pa02/Fi02 less than 300. Gathering of data ends 28&#xD;
      days after day 1 (IT MAY NOT CORRESPOND TO DAY 28 AFTER ADMISSION TO ICU); afterwards, data&#xD;
      such as date of extubation, of discharge from ICU and from hospital, and condition upon&#xD;
      discharge from hospital will be gathered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and analytic data will be gathered on admission, and afterwards at the same hour of&#xD;
      the morning, while the patient continues under invasive mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of ARDS is made by two procedures: (A) automatic, which will consist of&#xD;
      individually picking each variable pertaining to the definition, and afterwards, by way of a&#xD;
      computer algorithm, defining whether the patient complies with the Berlin definition; (B)&#xD;
      clinical, the attending physician will be asked daily, since the moment when PaO2/Fi02&lt;300,&#xD;
      what the reason for hypoxemia is. Both diagnoses will be independent and double-blinded. The&#xD;
      ratio of concordance will be calculated afterwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operational definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARDS: Berlin definition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Days free of mechanical ventilation are the number of days in which no invasive mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation is required, from disconnection to day 28. If the patient dies, 0 days free of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation will be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Driving pressure s the plateau pressure minus PEEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incidence is the number of patients diagnosed with ARDS divided by the number of patients who&#xD;
      required invasive mechanical ventilation over the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients with ARDS per bed of the service is the number of patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      ARDS divided by the number of beds suitable for mechanical ventilation available over the&#xD;
      study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term follow-up (1 and 3 years) will be carried out by the central coordination team via&#xD;
      e-mail or, occasionally, by telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, a single database will be generated, with which the final report will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with incomplete data will be excluded from the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to fulfill objective 1, a descriptive epidemiological analysis of the primary and&#xD;
      secondary events gathered in patients diagnosed with ARDS according to the Berlin definition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to fulfill objective 2, a comparison is made between the proportion of primary and&#xD;
      secondary events between the altitude cohort and the sea-level cohort. Categorical variables&#xD;
      are presented as number of cases and percentage, continuous variables are presented as median&#xD;
      and percentiles 25-75. Categorical variables are compared by the chi-2 continuous variables&#xD;
      are compared by Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to fulfill objective 3, ROC curves will be made for each event, taking into&#xD;
      consideration the unadjusted and altitude-adjusted Berlin definition as dependent variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final data report will be done following the recommendations of the Strengthening the&#xD;
      Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement guidelines for&#xD;
      observational cohort studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The whole statistical analysis will be made with the free R program&#xD;
      (http://www.R-project.org). All P values will be two-tail P values, considering a &lt;0.05 level&#xD;
      of signification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACCESSIBILITY OF DATA&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be accessible to any researcher upon written request to the Latin American&#xD;
      Network of High-Altitude Intensive Care Medicine (RELAMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The request must be written in Spanish and include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      justification for using the data&#xD;
&#xD;
      commitment to using the data for exclusively scientific purposes (explicitly stating that&#xD;
      they will not be used for economic purposes)&#xD;
&#xD;
      commitment to publishing the data in a pubmed indexed journal within a one-year period&#xD;
&#xD;
      proof of experience and background in the field of clinical research adhesion to the code of&#xD;
      ethics&#xD;
&#xD;
      RELAMI will analyze the request and decide within a 60-day period from receipt of the&#xD;
      request. If the response is positive, the data will be sent anonymized; if it is negative,&#xD;
      the reasons will be explained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECONOMIC ASPECTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study does not have sponsors. No researcher will receive economic compensation or any&#xD;
      other type of reward for participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL ASPECTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be carried out in accordance with the ethical principles established by the&#xD;
      International Conference on Harmonization, guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (GCP), which&#xD;
      stem from the Helsinki Declaration and applicable regulation norms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is considered to be of insignificant low risk, since it is an observational,&#xD;
      non-interventional study, and the data are gathered without identification. Each&#xD;
      participating ICU will process the pertaining institutional approvals, including a&#xD;
      renunciation of ethical revision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recorded dispensation of each participant for gathering clinical data without identification&#xD;
      will be sought as part of routine clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA MANAGEMENT AND DISSEMINATION OF RESULTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lead researchers and the Coordination Center will act as guardians of the data. Reports&#xD;
      of progress and final reports will be presented opportunely in national and international&#xD;
      conferences, giving priority to presentation during annual conferences in Latin America.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the study will be published in indexed scientific journals, preferably of the&#xD;
      first decile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only aggregated and disidentified data will be publicly presented.&#xD;
