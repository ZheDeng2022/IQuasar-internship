  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating three drugs called Nivolumab, Bevacizumab, and Rucaparib as&#xD;
      a possible treatment for relapsed Relapsed Ovarian, Fallopian Tube Or Peritoneal Cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Cancers are recognized by the immune&#xD;
      system, and under some circumstances,the immune system may control or even eliminate tumors.&#xD;
      An antibody is a natural protein made by our immune system that binds other proteins and&#xD;
      molecules to fight infection and its ill effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nivolumab is an experimental antibody drug that may make the immune response more active&#xD;
      against Cancer. Bevacizumab is an antibody that works by stopping the formation of blood&#xD;
      vessels.Rucaparib is an oral pill that can block the ways cells repair their DNA, which can&#xD;
      cause damage to certain cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Nivolumab for Relapsed&#xD;
      Ovarian, Fallopian Tube Or Peritoneal Cancer but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab has been FDA approved when used together with chemotherapy for the treatment of&#xD;
      Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, Or Primary Peritoneal Cancer that has returned within 6 months of a&#xD;
      chemotherapy that contains a platinum drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rucaparib has been FDA approved for the treatment of patients with BRCA-mutated ovarian&#xD;
      cancer who have been treated with 2 or more prior chemotherapies or as maintenance therapy&#xD;
      following for women with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of Nivolumab, Bevacizumab, and Rucaparib has not been approved by the FDA in&#xD;
      any setting.&#xD;

             months of amenorrhea in a woman over 45 in the absence of other biological or&#xD;
             physiological causes. Additionally, women under the age of 62 who are not surgically&#xD;
             sterile must have a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level less&#xD;

             contraception for 6 months after the last dose of study treatment, per FDA&#xD;
             recommendations on use of contraception following bevacizumab. Should a woman become&#xD;
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should&#xD;
             inform her treating physician immediately. Patients receiving rucaparib should&#xD;

             replacement doses of systemic corticosteroids are permitted, even if &gt; 10 mg/day&#xD;
             prednisone equivalents, in the absence of active autoimmune disease. A brief course of&#xD;
             corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g., contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of&#xD;
