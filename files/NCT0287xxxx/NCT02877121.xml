      The purpose of this study is to assess the Respiratory Muscle Function and Neural Respiratory&#xD;
      Drive in Interstitial Lung Disease patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In total, 50 patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) are going to recruited.The&#xD;
      patients are studied at the afternoon in a semirecumbent position. After the application of&#xD;
      topical anaesthesia (2% xylocaine), the patient will be asked to swallow two balloon-tipped&#xD;
      catheters and the multi-pair esophageal electrode catheter through the nose into the their&#xD;
      right position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first period, the stable signals of unassisted spontaneous breathing (about 10min)&#xD;
      were chosen to be recorded. The Esophageal and gastric balloon-catheters are used to detect&#xD;
      the intra-thoracic and abdominal pressure.The diaphragm electromyogram (EMGdi) will be&#xD;
      recorded from a multipair esophageal electrode.The baseline data of the respiratory muscle&#xD;
      activity will be detected by these catheters and electrode.p0.1 (the negative airway pressure&#xD;
      generated during the first 100 ms of an occluded inspiration) will be also meassured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first period, the nonvolitional tests on respiratory muscle function and strength&#xD;
      (twitch mouth and transdiaphragmatic pressure during bilateral magnetic phrenic nerve&#xD;
      stimulation (TwPmo and TwPdi) will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the second period,the patients will be ask to perform different maneuvers, including&#xD;
      maximal inspiration against a closed valve ,maximal inspiration to total lung capacity&#xD;
      (TLC),maximalexpiration at the total lung capacity (TLC) against a closed valve and maximal&#xD;
      sniff from functional residual capacity(FRC).Each maneuver will repeated more than three&#xD;
      times with an interval of 30 s or more. Inspiratory capacity(IC),global maximal inspiratory&#xD;
      pressure (PImax), maximal sniff nasal pressure (SnPna) and maximalexpiratory pressure will be&#xD;
      meassured with the balloon-catheters.The maximal value of the diaphragm electromyogram&#xD;
      (EMGdi) will be recorded during these maneuvers.&#xD;
