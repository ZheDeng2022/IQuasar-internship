      This study examines the metabolic effects of 3 possible test meals (Oleogel) and/or 3&#xD;
      possible test meals (Grass Jelly). The participants will have the option to voluntarily&#xD;

      This study examines the metabolic effects of 3 possible test meals (Oleogel) and/or 3&#xD;
      possible test meals (Grass Jelly). The participants will have the option to voluntarily&#xD;
      choose which study part(s) to participate. This study will be evaluated on 40 healthy Chinese&#xD;
      male subjects from the general public over a period of one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments will be randomized to receive 3 different test meals (Oleogel) and/or 3 different&#xD;
      test meals. Randomization means assigning the participants to the test meals by chance, like&#xD;
      tossing a coin or rolling a dice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participants take part in this study, the participants will be required to come on 3&#xD;
      non-consecutive days and/or 5 non-consecutive days to evaluate the 3 different test meals&#xD;
      (Oleogel) and/or 3 different test meal (Grass jelly) respectively, in random order with a&#xD;
      minimum of 1 week between the test sessions. For each session, the participants are required&#xD;
      to come between 8:00-9:00am, with each session lasting approximately 3.5 hours to 6.5 hours.&#xD;
      The participants would have to come following a 10-12 hour overnight fast. An indwelling&#xD;
      catheter will be inserted into a vein in the participants' forearm for the remainder of the&#xD;
      test session. The investigators will then take a blood sample from the cannula to measure&#xD;
      baseline values. The investigators will also take the participant's capillary blood via&#xD;
      finger prick to measure blood glucose concentration. After obtaining the baseline blood&#xD;
      samples, the investigator will give the participants the test meal to eat within 10 minutes&#xD;
      and fill up a 'liking' questionnaire. Following the meal the investigators will take further&#xD;
      blood samples (from the cannula and finger pricks) for the next 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120,&#xD;
      150, 180, (treatment 4, 5, 6), 210, 240, 270, 300, 330, 360 minutes (Treatment 1, 2, 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amount of blood that will be collected at every time point will be about 5ÂµL droplet from&#xD;
      fingerprick and approximately 5mL of blood from cannulation, the accumulative amount per test&#xD;
      session will approximately 50 to 80 ml, and the accumulative amount for the entire study&#xD;
      duration will be approximately 240 mL of blood by cannula and finger pricks (Part A) and 150&#xD;
      ml (Part B). The investigators will also ask the participants to answer a questionnaire about&#xD;
      measurement of hunger and fullness at the same times the blood samples are taken. The&#xD;
      appetite-rating questionnaire consists of 100mm continuous lines anchored at each end with&#xD;
      opposing statements for a question asked. The specific questions asked will be: 'How hungry&#xD;
      do you feel?', 'How full do you feel?', How strong is your desire to eat?', 'How much food do&#xD;
      you think you can eat?' and 'Do you have any preoccupation with thoughts of food right now?'.&#xD;
      Using a pen, you would have to make a mark on the line corresponding to how you feel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the VAS scales, the current trial will collect information on the prospective&#xD;
      portion that participants would like to consume for a range of different foods at different&#xD;
      time points; at every 30 minutes interval from baseline till the end of each test session.&#xD;
      This computer based task presents a range of foods to participants and asks &quot;how much of this&#xD;
      food would you like to consume right now?&quot;, allowing the participants to move between a&#xD;
      series of different portions of each food and select the one that the participants would like&#xD;
      to consume at that time based on the participants' feeling of hunger, fullness and desire to&#xD;
      eat. The foods will be deliberately chosen to represent common Singaporean meals, desserts&#xD;
      and snack foods that are regularly eaten to relieve hunger in different situations and the&#xD;
      range of portions available is the same across all foods (20-1200 kcals in 20 kcal steps).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the evenings before the test sessions, the participants will be expected to come and&#xD;
      collect a standard dinner meal. The participants will be advised not to take part in any&#xD;
      strenuous physical activities for at least 3 days and avoid caffeine and alcohol consumption&#xD;
      the day before the test sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects participation in the study will last a maximum of 20.5 hours (Part A) and 11.5 hours&#xD;
      (Part B), include one screening visit lasting around 1 hour.&#xD;
