    <textblock>
      The investigators do the clinical trial (patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated&#xD;
      with donafenib/placebo after failure of standard therapy) to assess efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      donafenib in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, progressing after all approved&#xD;
      standard therapies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomization,multicentre, phase 3 study recruiting 510 patients. Patients&#xD;
      were eligible to participate when they have histological or cytological documentation of&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum. They must have received locally and currently approved&#xD;
      standard therapies and to have disease progression during or within 3 months after the last&#xD;
      administration of the last standard therapy or to have stopped standard therapy because of&#xD;
      unacceptable toxic effects. The available standard therapies have to include as many of the&#xD;
      following as were licensed: a fluoropyrimidine,oxaliplatin,irinotecan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients receive best supportive care, excluding other investigational antitumour agents&#xD;
      or antineoplastic chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral donafenib 300mg (CM4307) on days 1-21 of each 4 weeks cycle until&#xD;
      disease progression,death,or the unacceptable toxic effects.The primary endpoint is overall&#xD;
      survival.The second endpoint is progression-free survival.&#xD;
