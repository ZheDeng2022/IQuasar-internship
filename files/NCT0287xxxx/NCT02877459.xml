  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The AeriSeal-STAGE trial will be a prospective, multicenter study that intends to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety of a modified staged treatment algorithm with an escalation of dose using the&#xD;
      AeriSeal System in the treatment of subjects with severe emphysema in a controlled trial&#xD;
      design setting as compared to published data from prior studies. The trial is anticipated to&#xD;
      enroll fifteen (15) study subjects with homogeneous, or upper lobe predominant heterogeneous&#xD;
      emphysema, in three (3) centers in Europe.&#xD;

    <description>Assessment of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)&#xD;
To evaluate the safety of using a modified staged treatment algorithm at 3- months following the second placement of AeriSeal foam treatment in subjects with severe emphysema. The primary endpoint will be safety of AeriSeal System treatment. Safety will be assessed by monitoring the incidence of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), during the 3-months post treatment period. Exclusively, the incidence of a prospectively specified subset of important respiratory related SAEs (COPD exacerbations requiring hospitalization or extended hospitalization, pneumonia, acute inflammatory response occurring after 30-days posttreatment, pneumothoraces), deaths and respiratory failures will be lower as compared to published data from prior studies.</description>

    <description>Absolute change relative to baseline at 3-months, 6-months and 12-months for SGRQ.&#xD;
The St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire measures health status (quality of life) in patients with diseases of airways obstruction. The questionnaire comprises of two parts:&#xD;
Part I: Symptoms (frequency &amp; severity) Part II: Activities that cause or are limited by breathlessness; Impacts (social functioning, psychological disturbances resulting from airways disease)&#xD;
A Total score is calculated which summarizes the impact of the disease on overall health status. Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more limitations.</description>
