  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this investigational research study is to determine how safe and&#xD;
      tolerable the study drug, MEDI4736 (Durvalumab), is in patients with myelofibrosis (MF). The&#xD;
      study drug belongs to a group of drugs called immune checkpoint inhibitors, which have shown&#xD;
      promise in other forms of cancer, such as melanoma and lung cancer. One of the effects that&#xD;
      this drug has is to activate the patient's own natural immune system. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to examine the safety and tolerability of the study drug, to study how effective it&#xD;
      is at treating patients with myelofibrosis, and to explore how certain markers in the&#xD;
      patient's blood and/or bone marrow may be affected by the study drug.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety profile of anti-programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PDL1) therapy in&#xD;
      patients with myelofibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Changes in MF symptom burden. II. Changes in spleen size. III. Blood and/or bone marrow&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the rate of lymphocyte subset response to anti-PDL1 therapy, as measured by&#xD;
      the percent increase in cluster of differentiation (CD)4+CD25+PD-L1+ T-lymphocytes and&#xD;
      CD4+CD62L+CD127+ T lymphocytes in post-treatment peripheral blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To characterize changes in the cytokine profile in response to anti-PDL1 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To measure soluble PDL1 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in post-treatment&#xD;
      blood and/or bone marrow samples and programmed cell death-1 (PD1)/PDL1 by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry on bone marrow samples and correlate with treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive durvalumab intravenously (IV) over approximately 1 hour on day 1. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 28 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable disease (SD), no new inter-current illness, and&#xD;
      no unacceptable toxicity, may continue treatment beyond 3 courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed every 3 months for up to two years starting from Day 1.&#xD;
