      We aim to retrieve olfactory bulbs (OBs) from suitable human donors. We have defined two&#xD;
      groups who will qualify:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 - Deceased Donors:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1A: Donors after brainstem death (DBDs) undergoing solid organ donation&#xD;
&#xD;
      1B: Donors after brainstem death (DBDs) considered unsuitable for solid organ donation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 - Living Donors:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurosurgical patients undergoing anterior cranial surgery in which the olfactory nerve (ON)&#xD;
      is cut as part of the surgical procedure. The OB of the concomitant severed ON would be&#xD;
      donated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to optimise OB collection and Olfactory Ensheathing Cell (OEC) culture and storage. We&#xD;
      will study the effects of patient diagnosis, age, cause of death (if applicable),&#xD;
      co-morbidities and warm ischaemic time on cell survival and regenerative function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In future studies we aim to store OECs in a GMP facility and transplant OECs into patients&#xD;
      with spinal cord injuries.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition. To date there is no treatment to improve&#xD;
      outcome. There is limited regenerative capacity of the central nervous system (CNS), such&#xD;
      that damaged neurons and severed axons are not replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A substantial body of evidence suggests that olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) obtained from&#xD;
      olfactory bulbs (OBs) facilitate neuronal regeneration in rodents and humans with SCI.&#xD;
      Indeed, transplanting autologous OECs from an OB into the injury site improved neurological&#xD;
      outcome in a patient with SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Harvesting autologous OBs to culture OECs has several disadvantages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. If the OECs do not grow in vitro, the transplantation is abandoned;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The retrieval procedure exposes a paralysed patient to the risks of craniotomy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Excising an OB can impair the sense of smell; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The number of OECs obtained is limited to one OB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will collect human OECs from suitable donors which we have defined as two&#xD;
      groups. Group 1 patients will be brain dead donors identified by the neuro-intensive care&#xD;
      team as potential candidates for solid organ donation. The OBs will be retrieved as near to&#xD;
      death as possible. Group 2 patients will be living donors undergoing elective neurosurgery in&#xD;
      which the olfactory nerve is sacrificed as part of that procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two OBs located at the anterior skull base, responsible for transmitting the&#xD;
      sensation of smell from the nose to the brain. Obtaining OECs requires a craniotomy (opening&#xD;
      the skull) to remove the OBs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE 1 will be divided into 2 stages. In stage 1 we will culture OECs and characterise them&#xD;
      in the central laboratory. We aim to determine how the yield of OECs and their regenerative&#xD;
      properties are affected by freeze-thaw, time left at room temperature and time left at 40C&#xD;
      before culture as well as patient age. Each harvested sample will be transferred to the lab&#xD;
      for further processing. Processing includes but is not limited to histological fixation,&#xD;
      sectioning and staining, cell culture and storage. Some OECs will be frozen in liquid&#xD;
      nitrogen to determine whether they can indeed be stored. In stage 2 we will transfer OECs&#xD;
      outside St. George's to a GMP facility (to be determined). In the GMP facility, the OECs will&#xD;
      be processed and stored according to the optimised conditions we have determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In PHASE 2, the OECs will be transplanted into patients with SCI.&#xD;
