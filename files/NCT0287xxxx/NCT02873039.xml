  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past decade, advancements in therapies available for pulmonary hypertension (PH)&#xD;
      have increased life expectancy for those who qualify and receive treatment. Yet,&#xD;
      prognostication of these patients has remained a clinical dilemma. The application of the&#xD;
      REVEAL registry predictive algorithm provides information about estimated 1-year survival but&#xD;
      since invasive measurements from a right heart catheterization cannot easily be repeated, it&#xD;
      is not feasible to continually use this longitudinally to assess the disease burden. Simple&#xD;
      tests such as BNP has been shown to be very clinically relevant in short -term and long term&#xD;
      prognostication and seems to correspond well to the right ventricular failure. Elevated right&#xD;
      atrial pressures, and its estimation via IVC measurements predict poor survivorship in a&#xD;
      recent retrospective analysis. As clinical measurement of jugular venous pressure is becoming&#xD;
      less reliable, we aim to bring point- of-care ultrasound to the outpatient setting. Point of&#xD;
      care ultrasound is widely used in the Emergency Department and Intensive Care Unit settings.&#xD;
      By measuring estimated right atrial pressure (eRAP) via Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) measurements&#xD;
      at outpatient clinic visits we aim to find a correlation with the existing and widely used&#xD;
      B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP), that is collected at each visit as a part of regular care.&#xD;
      These measurements can be followed longitudinally and may aid in prognostication. Data will&#xD;
      be collected over the period of 1 year at clinic visits. A composite endpoint (including&#xD;
      death, hospitalizations for PH, addition of new PH specific therapy after a stabilization&#xD;
      period of 3 months, lung transplant or atrial septostomy) will separately be collected. At&#xD;
      the end of the data collection period, clinical data only will be collected for a additional&#xD;
      2 years via phone correspondence, chart review or at regular PH clinic visits.&#xD;

      Pulmonary hypertension patients who choose to participate:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent will be obtained for the study. Patients must sign the informed&#xD;
      consent before participating in any study related procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A medication history will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A smoking history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BNP levels will be measured as a part of usual care at PH visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasonographic measurements will be performed at the clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasonographic measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IVC Measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Performed in the subcostal view in supine position.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Images will be captured in a video format.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maximal IVC diameter 1 to 2 cm from the junction of the right atrium and the IVC at&#xD;
           end-expiration just proximal to the junction of the hepatic veins. The IVC&#xD;
           collapsibility index to give an estimate of RAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inspiratory collapse of &gt; 50% or &lt; 50% will be ascertained based on the measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Jugular Vein Measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient will be placed in 45° position&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Longitudinal images will be obtained of the right jugular vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Location of tapering of the jugular vein is measured, and distance from the sternal&#xD;
           angle is recorded as ultrasound-measured jugular venous pressure (JVP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Worsening Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      • At each visit during year 1, and then every 6 months for years 2-3, clinical worsening&#xD;
      events will be captured. These events are defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Death&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PH-related hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lung transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Atrial septostomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional Class worsening and step up in therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Timing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enrollment of patients for a period of 1 year. Subsequently, no more patients will be&#xD;
           enrolled. Patients who are enrolled will be followed clinically without further&#xD;
           study-related testing at their regular clinic visits after completion of year 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients enrolled will have ultrasonographic measurements of IVC and jugular veins&#xD;
           at each clinic visit for 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data collection regarding meeting clinical worsening end points and BNP levels will be&#xD;
           collected at the regular clinic visits at year 2 and 3 of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If patients are lost to follow up at clinics (including year-1), telephone&#xD;
           correspondence, social security database review or chart review at 6-month intervals&#xD;
           will be performed to determine vital status and see if they have met any clinical&#xD;
           worsening endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study will close after the final patient has completed 3-years of follow up.&#xD;
