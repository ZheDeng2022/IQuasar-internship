  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to observe and confirm the safety, tolerance and cell&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of lentivirus-transduced CAR-GPC3 T cells (CAR-GPC3 T cells targeting GPC3)&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single-center, open-label pilot study to determine the safety, tolerance and engraftment&#xD;
      potential of CAR-GPC3 T cells in subjects with GPC3+ positive lung squamous cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observe and determine the safety and tolerance in escalating dose infusion of CAR-GPC3 T&#xD;
      cells (CAR T cells targeting GPC3) transduced with the lentiviral vector, and the survival of&#xD;
      the CAT-GPC3 T cells in vivo, referred to as engraftment potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following indexes are monitored for curative effect of CAR-GPC3 T cells on lung squamous&#xD;
      cell carcinoma:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Objective response rate (ORR), is defined as the ratio of patients diagnosed as partial&#xD;
           remission (PR) to complete remission (CR) according to RECIST 1.1 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Progression free survival (PFS), is defined as the duration from baseline to PD (audited&#xD;
           and confirmed by independent imaging), or to the day of any death event. The earlier one&#xD;
           shall prevail.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Time to tumor progression (TTP), is defined as the duration from baseline to disease&#xD;
           starts to get worse or spreads to other parts of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Overall survival (OS), is defined as the time period from the 1st day of treatment to&#xD;
           the day of death for any reason. For patients who are still alive at the data analysis&#xD;
           day, OS data is subject to the last confirmed time of survival patients.&#xD;

    <description>Occurrence of study related adverse events, defined as laboratory toxicities and clinical events that are possibly, likely or definitely related to study treatment at any time from the infusion until week 24. This will include infusive toxicity, and any toxicity possibly related to the CAR-GPC3 T cells.</description>

    <description>The DNA vector copies per mL blood of CAR-GPC3 T cells on week 4 after the first infusion by Q-PCR. Q-PCR for CAR-GPC3 vector sequences will also be performed after infusion thereafter until any 2 sequential tests are negative documenting loss of CAR-GPC3 T cells within 2 years.</description>

    <description>Intravenous infusion with escalating dose is adopted in this study.&#xD;
Total dosage: 1 x 10^5 - 2 x 10^9 CAR-GPC3 T cells/kg&#xD;
The next dose and interval depends on the response of the subject to previous dose.&#xD;
Lymphodepletion:&#xD;
Fludarabine: 30 mg/m^2/day x 4 days; Cyclophosphamide: 500 mg/m^2/day x 2 days. Adjustment is in discretion of the investigator based on individual response.</description>
