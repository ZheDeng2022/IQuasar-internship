  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gait and balance problems are a significant source of disability in patients with Parkinson&#xD;
      disease. Physical therapy remains one of the main treatments. On the other hand some&#xD;
      medications, such as methyphenidate and atomoxetine, have been tried with promising results.&#xD;
      The outcomes in gait and balance in Parkinson disease after a combination of physical therapy&#xD;
      and the medications mentioned above have not been explored yet. The investigators want to&#xD;
      evaluate whether the addition of medication, either low dose of methylphenidate or&#xD;
      atomoxetine, to physical therapy will achieve improvement in gait and balance in Parkinson&#xD;
      disease more than physical therapy alone. The investigators propose a pilot, single center,&#xD;
      rater blind, prospective randomized trial. 2-arm-parallel group, intention-to-treat analysis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gait impairment and postural instability constitute major sources of disability in Parkinson&#xD;
      disease (PD). Increased level of dependence in activities of daily living and augmented risk&#xD;
      of falling are the main consequences. About 87% of patients experience at least one fall&#xD;
      during their illness, 65% an injury that requires evaluation in an emergency room, and up to&#xD;
      33% sustain one or more fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pedunculopontine nucleus, locus ceruleus, frontal brain cortex, and striatum play a critical&#xD;
      role in gait and balance, with dopamine, noradrenaline and acetylcholine as the main&#xD;
      neurotransmitters. Therefore, increased availability of dopamine in the nigrostriatal&#xD;
      pathway, and enhanced disposal of central noradrenaline and acetylcholine in the locus&#xD;
      ceruleus can in theory, contribute to improvement .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methylphenidate and atomoxetine are dopamine and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors approved&#xD;
      for the treatment of attention disorders. Interestingly, growing literature suggests a&#xD;
      promising role of these medications in gait and balance in PD. Three open-label studies&#xD;
      reported efficacy of methylphenidate in gait impairment in patients with PD. Auriel et al&#xD;
      used a single 20 mg dose of methylphenidate in 23 patients and found an improvement in gait&#xD;
      speed, stride time variability, and timed gait. In a second study, 5 patients received a&#xD;
      single 10-mg dose of methylphenidate and improvements were noted in total walking time, total&#xD;
      freezing time, number of freezing episodes, and nonfreezing walking time. Another study,&#xD;
      which evaluated a 50 to 80 mg dose of methylphenidate over 3 months in 17 patients undergoing&#xD;
      concomitant deep brain stimulation, found an improvement in both timed gait and in the number&#xD;
      of freezing episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the only randomized clinical trial with methylphenidate showed a different result.&#xD;
      Twenty-three subjects with PD and moderate gait impairment were screened for this 6- month,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Subjects were randomly assigned to high dose of&#xD;
      methylphenidate (maximum, up to 80 mg/day) or placebo for 12 weeks and crossed over after a&#xD;
      3-week washout. The primary outcome measure was change in a gait composite score obtained&#xD;
      through GAITrite (a system that was developed to measure and record temporal and spatial&#xD;
      parameters of gait by using a walkway approximately 3 meters long with grids of embedded,&#xD;
      pressure-sensitive sensors connected to a personal computer). Seventeen patients completed&#xD;
      the trial. There was no change in the gait composite score or any of the secondary or&#xD;
      exploratory variables such as fatigue, freezing, depression and daily sleepiness at 12 weeks;&#xD;
      however, some improvement was noted in the early phase of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The discrepancy between the results of the open label studies and the randomized study may be&#xD;
      explained by dose of methylphenidate substantially higher in the RCT compared to the first&#xD;
      two open-label studies. Whereas patients in the RCT received at least 65 mg/day, patients in&#xD;
      the first two open-label studies received 10-20 mg/day. It is been suggested that the&#xD;
      efficacy of methylphenidate and atomoxetine varies according to the dose administrated. The&#xD;
      complex pharmacodynamic of dopamine and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors in the presence of&#xD;
      other dopaminergic therapies such as Levodopa or dopamine agonist, can elicit differences in&#xD;
      response regarding the administered dose . During the early phase of the RCT when a trend&#xD;
      improvement was noted, smaller doses of methylphenidate were being used as the patients were&#xD;
      being titrated to their final dose. Low chronic doses of methylphenidate have not been tested&#xD;
      to improve gait and balance in PD in any trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the one pilot study thus far evaluating atomoxetine for gait freezing, a trend towards&#xD;
      improvement in the gait and balance scale (GABS) was noted. However, this study was&#xD;
      underpowered as only five patients participated in the study .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simultaneously, diverse modalities of physical therapy (PT) have shown improvement in gait&#xD;
      and balance in PD. A systematic review from Cochrane database concluded that different&#xD;
      physiotherapy interventions were better than placebo over three months, in terms of velocity,&#xD;
      two- or six-minute walk test, step length, Timed Up &amp; Go, Functional Reach Test, Berg Balance&#xD;
      Scale and clinician-rated UPDRS. The grade of improvement varied depending on the&#xD;
      intervention and outcome measure, ranging from 10 to 30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of the investigators' knowledge, the combination of medication and physical&#xD;
      therapy has never been evaluated previously in gait and balance in PD.&#xD;
