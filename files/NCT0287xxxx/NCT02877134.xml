    <measure>Part I: Change From Baseline in the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Score at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The CDAI will be assessed by collecting information on 8 different Crohn's disease-related variables: extra-intestinal manifestations, abdominal mass, weight, hematocrit, total number of liquid stools, abdominal pain/cramping, use of antidiarrheal drug(s) and/or opiates, and general well-being. The last 4 variables are scored over 7 days by the participant on a diary card.</description>

    <measure>Part II: Change in Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO)-2 from baseline at Week 12</measure>

    <measure>Part II: Change in Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) from baseline at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The SES-CD score is based on the evaluation of 4 endoscopic components (presence/size of ulcers, proportion of mucosal surface covered by ulcers, proportion of mucosal surface affected by any other lesions, and presence/type of narrowing/strictures) across 5 ileocolonic segments. Each endoscopic component is scored from 0 to 3 for each segment, and a total score is derived from the sum of all the component scores (range, 0 to 56).</description>

However, participants receiving Ustekinumab in countries where Ustekinumab is not commercially available or approved for adult Crohn's disease were continued to receive Ustekinumab in the LTE.</description>
