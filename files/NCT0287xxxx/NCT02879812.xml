    <textblock>
      The purpose of the current study is to test a systems-level approach to disseminate a&#xD;
      multicomponent, multilevel intervention consisting of educational materials about&#xD;
      transplantation and the new kidney allocation system targeting dialysis facility Medical&#xD;
      Directors, staff, and patients. Roughly 750 dialysis facilities in up to 18 end stage renal&#xD;
      disease Network regions across the United States will be randomized to receive intervention&#xD;
      materials. The overall goal of the study is to extend the influence of the national&#xD;
      allocation policy in reducing disparities in early steps in kidney transplant access.&#xD;

      The purpose of the ASCENT study is to test a systems-level approach to disseminate a&#xD;
      multi-component intervention consisting of in the era of the new national kidney allocation&#xD;
      policy and educational materials targeting dialysis facility Medical Directors, staff, and&#xD;
      patients. The investigators will randomize ~750 dialysis facilities in up to 18 End Stage&#xD;
      Renal Disease Network regions across the United States, where approximately half of&#xD;
      facilities will receive the intervention materials and half will receive an informational&#xD;
      brochure. This pragmatic, clinical effectiveness-implementation study will test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the multicomponent, multilevel interventions consisting of a tailored,&#xD;
      facility-specific transplant and disparity performance report, educational videos for staff&#xD;
      and dialysis patients, and an educational webinar for dialysis facility Medical Directors and&#xD;
      staff.&#xD;

    <description>Knowledge about the kidney allocation system was assessed using a survey among medical directors.&#xD;
The survey was used to quantify provider knowledge of Kidney Allocation System (KAS) and transplantation using a cumulative knowledge score ranging from 0 to 5 (0=least knowledge, 5=highest level of knowledge). A higher score is a better outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Post Intervention (Up to 3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Staff training about kidney transplant and the allocation system was assessed using a survey among medical directors. Providers were asked what percentage of staff they think have been trained and staff training score was based on facility-level average percent. Scores range from 0 to 5 with a higher score being a better outcome.&#xD;

        <description>Patient education about kidney transplant will be assessed using a survey among medical directors.&#xD;
