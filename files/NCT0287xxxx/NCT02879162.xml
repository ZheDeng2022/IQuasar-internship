      The standard or usual treatment for this disease may be chemotherapy or other types of&#xD;
      treatment to slow the spread of the disease and relieve some symptoms of this cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Durvalumab is a new type of drug for many types of cancer. Laboratory tests show that it&#xD;
      works by allowing the immune system to detect cancer and stimulate the immune response. This&#xD;
      may help to slow down the growth of cancer or may cause cancer cells to die. Durvalumab has&#xD;
      been shown to shrink tumours in animals and has been studied in 5000 people and seems&#xD;
      promising but it is not clear if it can offer better results than standard treatment alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tremelimumab is a new type of drug for various types of cancers. It works in a similar way to&#xD;
      durvalumab and may improve the effect of durvalumab. This may also help slow the growth of&#xD;
      the cancer cells or may cause cancer cells to die. Tremelimumab has been shown to shrink&#xD;
      tumours in animals and has been studied in 1500 people and seems promising but it is not&#xD;
      clear if it can offer better results than standard treatment alone when used with durvalumab&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combinations of durvalumab and tremelimumab have also been studied and when combined have&#xD;
      been shown to increase tumour shrinkage in animals compared to either drug alone. While the&#xD;
      combination has been studied in 250 people, it is not clear if it can offer better results&#xD;
      than standard treatment.&#xD;
