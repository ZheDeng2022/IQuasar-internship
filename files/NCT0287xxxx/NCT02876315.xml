  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many older adults do not get enough zinc, vitamin C and vitamin D, and this can be related to&#xD;
      decreased ability to fight infection. The purpose of this research study is to determine if&#xD;
      taking a multivitamin/mineral supplement every day for 12 weeks will increase the ability of&#xD;
      immune cells in blood to kill bacteria.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitamins C and D and the mineral zinc are each considered immune modulating micronutrients,&#xD;
      but their specific effects on the immune system, especially when used in combination, is&#xD;
      relatively unknown. Deficiency in each of these micronutrients is frequently observed in&#xD;
      aging adults and may contribute to age-related declines in immune status. Based on prior&#xD;
      published studies, the investigators hypothesize that supplementation of older adults with a&#xD;
      combination of vitamin C, vitamin D, and zinc will increase the innate ability of neutrophils&#xD;
      to kill invading bacteria through a variety of mechanisms, including increased phagocytosis,&#xD;
      antimicrobial peptide expression and changes in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study is designed to investigate the effects of Redoxon VI, a supplement&#xD;
      consisting of a combination of vitamin C, vitamin D, and zinc on functional markers of the&#xD;
      immune system of healthy, older adults when compared to a matched placebo. To accomplish&#xD;
      this, the investigators will recruit 40 healthy adults between the ages of 60 and 75 and&#xD;
      randomize them to either Redoxon VI or an identical, inactive placebo control supplement to&#xD;
      be taken twice a day for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since neutrophil-mediated killing is a crucial defense against Staphylococcus aureus&#xD;
      infection that declines with age, it will serve as a primary outcome in this study. Using&#xD;
      blood collected from individuals before and after supplementation, the investigators will&#xD;
      measure the ability of neutrophils to clear S. aureus cells, and compare the killing activity&#xD;
      in those individuals receiving the vitamin and mineral supplement to those receiving the&#xD;
      placebo. The investigators will confirm these changes in immune cell function by also&#xD;
      measuring phagocytic activity in neutrophils, as well as their ability to produce ROS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As secondary measures of immune function, the investigators will also determine circulating&#xD;
      levels of neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes, measure cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide&#xD;
      (also known as hCAP18/LL-37) levels, and determine changes in circulating levels of&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous studies, the investigators expect that any increase in functional immune&#xD;
      status will correspond to changes in vitamins C, D and zinc status in these individuals. The&#xD;
      investigators expect the results from this study to provide the foundation for future studies&#xD;
      investigating combinations of supplements on immune function and more extensive studies using&#xD;
      these micronutrients to restore declines in immune function observed in older adults.&#xD;
