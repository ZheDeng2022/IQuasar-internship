  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is limited information on the best psychoactive medication to treat agitated patients&#xD;
      in the emergency department. The intent of this study is to fill in knowledge gaps in the&#xD;
      current practice of treating psychiatric patients in the acute care setting. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to determine the best treatment for agitated psychiatric patients in the&#xD;
      emergency department.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with psychiatric complaints frequently present for evaluation and treatment in&#xD;
      emergency departments across the country. In particular, agitation in the emergency&#xD;
      department can have life-threatening consequences for both patients and staff, and so&#xD;
      patients are frequently given medications to reduce their level of agitation and permit&#xD;
      medical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and effectiveness of inhaled&#xD;
      loxapine (Adasuve) vs. traditional emergency department treatment with intramuscular&#xD;
      haloperidol with and without lorazepam in patients who present to the emergency department in&#xD;
      an acutely agitated state. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS-EC), Agitation and&#xD;
      Calmness Evaluation Scale (ACES) will be used as measurements of agitation and Barnes&#xD;
      akathisia scale will be used as measurements of side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are five secondary objectives: (1) To assess the level of agitation of psychiatric&#xD;
      patients presenting to the emergency department using the PANSS-EC, ACES and Barnes scale;&#xD;
      (2) To determine the effect of the level of agitation related to medication treatment and&#xD;
      physical restraint using the PANSS-EC; (3) To determine the complication rate of the various&#xD;
      medications administered with and without physical restraint; (4) To compare the&#xD;
      effectiveness of various pharmacologic agents used in the emergency department for agitation&#xD;
      using the delta of agitation over time (5) To determine the effect of the treatment choice on&#xD;
      emergency department throughout time using emergency department (ED) throughput time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is to demonstrate superiority of inhaled loxapine (Adasuve) to&#xD;
      the traditional anti-psychotic agents (with or without benzodiazepine) in the effectiveness&#xD;
      of the treatment of agitation at 15 minute treatment time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is an observational convenience (when a research assistant is available), analysis&#xD;
      of patients who are given psychoactive medications in the emergency department for agitation&#xD;
      during a twelve month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will determine the level of patient agitation using the Positive and Negative&#xD;
      Syndrome Scale (PANSS-EC), Agitation and Calmness Evaluation Scale (ACES) and Barnes&#xD;
      akathisia scale. These scales were chosen because of their usage and applicability in studies&#xD;
      of the treatment of agitation. The scales will be administered to the patients upon arrival,&#xD;
      at fifteen minutes for the first hour and then every half hour for the next 2.5 hours or&#xD;
      until the patient leaves the emergency department. The time medications are administered will&#xD;
      be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All agitated patients presenting to Mount Sinai Hospital emergency departments who, in the&#xD;
      judgment of an ED clinician require treatment. Patients will be treated within the standard&#xD;
      of care with the additional of one additional FDA approved medication. All agitated patients&#xD;
      presenting to the ED with a psychiatric related complaint, in the judgement of the ED&#xD;
      clinician will be prescribed a treatment of choice. The choices will include inhaled loxapine&#xD;
      (Adasuve) vs. traditional emergency department treatment with intramuscular haloperidol with&#xD;
      and without lorazepam. Clinicians will be free to prescribe any medication that they feel&#xD;
      benefits the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research associates will approach patients who the emergency physician has deemed as agitated&#xD;
      and in need of treatment. The research associate will obtain consent from the patient or&#xD;
      their surrogate, if patient is not competent to consent to use the patient's information and&#xD;
      ensure that the patient meets all study inclusion and no exclusion criteria. If the patient&#xD;
      does not have the capacity to consent and no surrogate is available to consent, we will&#xD;
      obtain patient data. When the patient gains capacity to consent, they will be approached to&#xD;
      consent for use of their information that is being captured. Should these patients refuse&#xD;
      consent; all information obtained will be destroyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research associate will obtain consent from the patient or their surrogate and ensure&#xD;
      that the patient meets all study inclusion and no exclusion criteria. The researcher will&#xD;
      observe the patient and record the level of agitation over a 2.5 hour time period. The&#xD;
      research associate will complete all study documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be evaluated by the emergency physician to provide medical clearance. The&#xD;
      primary purpose of medical clearance is to determine whether a medical illness is causing or&#xD;
      exacerbating the psychiatric condition. The secondary purpose is to identify medical or&#xD;
      surgical conditions incidental to the psychiatric problem that may need treatment. The&#xD;
      emergency service is responsible for the evaluation and treatment of a patients' agitation.&#xD;
      They will determine the need for and choice of treatment option for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Teva Pharmaceuticals will provide a supply of Loxapine (Adasuve) for the emergency department&#xD;
      for the time period of the study. The Principle Investigator has been in communication with&#xD;
      the Pharmacy department regarding the storage and distribution of the drug. Please see&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria in &quot;Eligibility&quot;. The emergency department staff will be&#xD;
      educated about the appropriate use of this education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research associate will obtain all necessary data elements either from the patient or the&#xD;
      medical record. They will observe and record the PANSS-EC, ACES, and Barnes scores on each&#xD;
      enrolled patient every fifteen minutes for the first hour then every half hour for a total of&#xD;
      2.5 hours or until the patient leaves the emergency department. Information will be collected&#xD;
      on a data collection sheet that will include basic demographic information on the patient,&#xD;
      age, gender, diagnosis, current medication, level of agitation before and after treatment,&#xD;
      number of restraints, vital signs, time restraints were applied, type and time medication is&#xD;
      administered and complications of therapy. A research associate will complete the data&#xD;
      collection sheet and input the data of enrolled patients. The patients' psychiatric diagnosis&#xD;
      from the psychiatric service will be noted. The research fellow will complete all study&#xD;
      documents. The statistician will perform an analysis of the data looking for statistical&#xD;
      significance of the data to the posed questions. Once all data is collected, any identifying&#xD;
      information on the patient will be destroyed to ensure patient confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following data collection, the data will be analyzed using commercially-available software&#xD;
      packages (such SPSS) to determine agitation reduction using 95% confidence intervals to&#xD;
      exclude the margin.&#xD;
