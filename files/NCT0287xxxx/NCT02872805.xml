  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the distinct challenges faced by emerging adults with HIV is the transition of their&#xD;
      care from their long-term pediatric HIV provider to treatment within an adult HIV program.&#xD;
      The consequences of an unsuccessful transition can range from difficult to catastrophic. The&#xD;
      Adolescent to Adult Patient-centered HIV Transition (ADAPT) Study is a prospective cohort&#xD;
      trial of an innovative intervention targeting gaps in care that are major drivers of loss in&#xD;
      the ART continuum of care cascade among adolescents and increasing missed opportunities to&#xD;
      engage adolescents into care. The specific aims of ADAPT are: 1. To inform strategies for&#xD;
      transition services in resource-limited settings; 2. To examine the developmental, clinical,&#xD;
      and other factors that predict a successful transition; and, 3. To gain fundamental insight&#xD;
      on implementation barriers among African adolescents through the application of the&#xD;
      ego-network defined social support that will inform targets for structured intervention.&#xD;
      ADAPT will be conducted in central, southern, and northern Nigeria at selected PEPFAR sites&#xD;
      supported by the Institute of Human Virology, Nigeria. To address Aim 1 the investigators&#xD;
      will conduct six focus groups including: Adolescent patients, parents and health care&#xD;
      providers. To address aim 2, the investigators will conduct a cluster randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial. The two interventions are based on prior evidence-informed engagement strategies: 1)&#xD;
      educational interventions and 2) interventions that use a peer transition advocate who&#xD;
      prepares the adolescent and their parents for transition. The investigators will enroll 300&#xD;
      patients (150 patients in each arm). The sites will be assigned to either the intervention&#xD;
      arm or a control arm. The primary outcome will be successful transition, keeping two&#xD;
      follow-up appointments within a nine months period following transition. Secondary outcomes,&#xD;
      as recommended by focus group participants will also be measured. To examine the potential&#xD;
      role of social network components and characteristics of both egos and alters on primary&#xD;
      outcomes, a Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) approach will be used to explore the&#xD;
      associations between primary outcomes and factors at the ego, alter, and network levels. The&#xD;
      finding from this study will guide institution of best practices for transitioning&#xD;
      adolescents in Nigeria and other countries lower and middle income countries with similar&#xD;
      challenges and potential for high impact.&#xD;

    <description>The PTAs will be present during patient clinic appointments to mentor and support participants in the development of independent health care behaviors. They will engage patients in role-plays to simulate appointments in adult practices. The PTAs will accompany patients during the transition process to the adult providers, to inform, support, and facilitate their successful transition to adult care. PTA duties, performed in the clinic and in the community, will include psychosocial support; facilitation of disclosure; adherence counseling, monitoring, and support; screening of patients for significant signs of illness and referral for care; and tracking and defaulter tracing of patients. PTA will support counseling and testing services for adolescents within the facilities. For those perinatally-infected, important care and support services include disclosure and stigma issues.</description>

    <ipd_description>The data collected under this proposed study will be securely stored at the IHV-Nigeria Central Data Management Center. The final dataset will include demographic and behavioral data, clinical data from treatment and follow up and laboratory data. The samples and data will be available for international collaborators to share after a time decided by the study implementation committee which allows sufficient time for the investigators on the study to address specific study questions. Requests for data will be reviewed by the ethics committee. The investigators will make the data and associated documentation available to users only under a data-sharing agreement that provides for: (1) a commitment to using the data only for research purposes and not to identify any individual participant; (2) a commitment to securing the data using appropriate computer technology; and (3) a commitment to destroying or returning the data after analyses are completed.</ipd_description>
