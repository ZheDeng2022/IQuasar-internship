      This study evaluates the associations between biomarkers of ageing, comprehensive geriatric&#xD;
      status, telomere length and progerin level, the composition of the gut microbiota, 16sRNA&#xD;
      metagenome sequencing in Moscow centenarians.&#xD;

      The global average life expectancy and the average age of the population are growing steadily&#xD;
      along with the age-related diseases. The same trend is also observed in our country.&#xD;
      Although, maximum life span in Russia decreases. E.g., the number of centenarians in Moscow&#xD;
      decreased by 244 persons from 2013 to 2014. There were about 400 centenarians in Moscow in&#xD;
      2014. That is about 3.3 per 100 000 population. In the US, this figure is about 10-20, and&#xD;
      there are 50 centenarians per 100 000 population in the Okinawa region, Japan. The rate of&#xD;
      ageing varies substantially, a prime example of this is the centenarians population. These&#xD;
      people break conventional stereotypes about aging. Chronic diseases in centenarians are&#xD;
      postponed. They are more active, they work longer, they can better tolerate stressful&#xD;
      situations. Scientists all over the world are trying to find the secret of their longevity.&#xD;
      Studies on the medical and social aspects of centenarian longevity are actively carried out&#xD;
      in the US, Europe, Japan, Australia. In Russia studies were carried out in St. Petersburg,&#xD;
      Western and Eastern Siberia. According to the New England Centenarian Study, the&#xD;
      supercentenarians (persons who have lived more than 110 years) life span is actually equal to&#xD;
      the healthy span without serious illnesses. The aim of research is to study features of&#xD;
      social status, lifestyle, habits, clinical status, blood chemistry, the amount of progerin,&#xD;
      genome, composition of the gut microbiota in Moscow centenarians in order to create a model&#xD;
      of healthy aging. In this study a comprehensive analysis of the longevity phenomenon of one&#xD;
      hundred centenarians from Moscow and the Moscow region planning to be conducted. Analyzing of&#xD;
      anamnesis vitae, medical, social, neuro-cognitive, and genetic features is planning. Each&#xD;
      study participant will undergo a comprehensive geriatric assessment, including examination by&#xD;
      the neurologist, an assessment of cognitive status,psychogeriatric consultation with the&#xD;
      assessment of self-perceptions of aging and depression assessment by using the geriatric&#xD;
      depression scale, neuropsychological testing using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA),&#xD;
      verbal recognition memory 12 word test, clock-drawing test.Telomere length and progerin level&#xD;
      in buffy coat layer evaluation, 16sRNA metagenome sequencing, and nuclear magnetic resonance&#xD;
      spectroscopy for qualitative and quantitative analysis of metabolites in blood serum, will be&#xD;
      done in all participants. This study will take the science closer to the goal of identifying&#xD;
      the patterns of &quot;healthy&quot; aging.&#xD;
