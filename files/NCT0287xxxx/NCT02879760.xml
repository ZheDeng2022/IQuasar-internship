      This is a Phase 1/2, multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation trial of Ad-MAGEA3 and&#xD;
      MG1-MAGEA3 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer who&#xD;
      have completed a first standard therapy with at least 1 cycle of platinum based chemotherapy&#xD;
      and/or at least one treatment of PD-1 or PD-L1 antibody targeted therapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, dose-escalation trial of Ad MAGEA3 and MG1-MAGEA3 in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab in patients with NSCLC (histological subtype of squamous and&#xD;
      non-squamous NSCLC). In Phase 1, patients who have progressed after treatment with a&#xD;
      platinum-based regimen and/or PD-1/PD-L1 targeted antibody therapy will be enrolled. In Phase&#xD;
      2, only patients who have progressed after treatment regimen containing PD-1/PD-L1 targeted&#xD;
      antibody therapy will be enrolled. In the Phase 1 portion of the study, MG1-MAGEA3 treatment&#xD;
      will be escalated in a sequential dose-escalating design. In the Phase 2 portion of the&#xD;
      study, MG1-MAGEA3 treatment will be at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the maximum&#xD;
      feasible dose (MFD). The Ad-MAGEA3 and pembrolizumab dose is fixed in both the Phase 1 and&#xD;
      Phase 2 portions of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 Enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts 1 through 5:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three patients will be treated at each dose level unless a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), as&#xD;
      defined below, is observed. Patients will be observed for a DLT through Day 29. After&#xD;
      enrollment of the first patient in each cohort, 2 additional patients will be enrolled after&#xD;
      the initial patient reaches Day 29 without experiencing a DLT. Treatment with MG1-MAGEA3 will&#xD;
      proceed to the next dose level if 0 of 3 patients experiences a DLT. If one of the first 3&#xD;
      patients experiences a DLT, additional patients will be enrolled until a second patient&#xD;
      experiences a DLT (which defines the toxic dose) or until 6 total patients have been treated,&#xD;
      whichever comes first. If a second DLT is not experienced within that cohort, dose escalation&#xD;
      may continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If 2 DLTs are observed within a cohort, enrollment into the cohort will cease and the dose&#xD;
      level immediately preceding that dose will be determined as the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ad-MAGEA3 will be administered by intramuscular (IM) injection at a dose level of 2 x 1011&#xD;
      virus particles (VP) on Day 1. MG1-MAGEA3 will be administered by intravenous (IV) infusion&#xD;
      at escalating dose levels on Day 15 and Day 18. In Cohorts 1 through 5, patients will receive&#xD;
      pembrolizumab at a dose of 200 mg IV on Day 22, and every 3 weeks thereafter until confirmed&#xD;
      radiographic progression or unmanageable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 6:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon determination of the MTD/MFD (safety assessment) in Cohorts 4-5, the treatment regimen&#xD;
      will next be optimized such that pembrolizumab will begin on Day 1 (concurrent treatment).&#xD;
      The Day 15 and Day 18 doses of MG1-MAGEA3 will be the doses defined as the MTD/MFD in either&#xD;
      Cohort 4 or5. Specifically, the regimen evaluated in Cohort 6 is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 1: Patients will receive 2 x 1011 VP IM of Ad-MAGEA3 and 200 mg IV of pembrolizumab&#xD;
           (the Pembrolizumab will be continued every 3 weeks [Q3W]).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 15: Patients will receive IV MG1-MAGEA3 at the MTD/MFD established for the first&#xD;
           infusion from Cohort 4 or Cohort 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 18: Patients will receive IV MG1-MAGEA3 at the MTD/MFD established for the second&#xD;
           infusion from Cohort 4 or Cohort 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three patients will be treated according to the dose schedule above unless a DLT is&#xD;
           observed between Day 1 and Day 29, at which time three additional patients will be&#xD;
           enrolled onto this cohort. If 2 DLTs occur within these six patients treated in Cohort&#xD;
           6, this cohort will be stopped and a new Cohort will be initated again with patients&#xD;
           treated concurrently with pembrolizumab but with a 0.5 log lower dose of MG1-MAGEA3 than&#xD;
           used in Cohort 6 for the Day 15 and Day 18 doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 Enrollment Phase 2 enrollment will commence upon completion of dose escalation and&#xD;
      determination of the MTD/MFD. In Stage 1 of the 2-Stage design, 18 evaluable patients will be&#xD;
      treated at the MTD/MFD (this will include patients treated at the MTD/MFD in Phase 1 who meet&#xD;
      Phase 2 inclusion criteria). If 1 or more patients respond, the study may continue to Stage&#xD;
      2, and an additional 14 evaluable patients will be enrolled for a total of 32 evaluable&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A patient will be defined as being evaluable for the primary endpoint (EPPE) and included in&#xD;
      the Simon 2-stage study design if they are seronegative to adenovirus Type 5, the virus used&#xD;
      in the prime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data from two other Turnstone Ad/MG1-MAGEA3 trials indicates that patients&#xD;
      without pre-existing anti-adenovirus antibodies (seronegative) prior to treatment have a&#xD;
      greater likelihood of generating MAGEA3 specific T-cell responses than those that are&#xD;
      seropositive at baseline. Therefore, this study is designed to primarily determine the&#xD;
      response rate and clinical outcome for this homogenous population of Ad5 seronegative&#xD;
      patients whom are most likely to benefit from Ad/MG1-MAGEA3 treatment. However, there is a&#xD;
      small subset of seropositive patients who developed significant anti-MAGEA3 T-cell responses&#xD;
      after Ad/MG1-MAGEA3 treatment. In addition, the presence of Ad5 seropositivity would not be&#xD;
      expected to have any significant impact on the potential benefit of MG1-MAGEA3 tumor&#xD;
      oncolysis. Therefore, exploratory data on clinical and immune response in the Ad5&#xD;
      seropositive population will be conducted and the study will enroll both Ad5 seronegative and&#xD;
      positive patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that approximately half of the patients enrolled will be seronegative to&#xD;
      Ad5, therefore Stage 1 of the Simon 2-stage design above will enroll approximately 18&#xD;
      patients and Stage 2 will enroll approximately 14 patients. Total study enrollment is&#xD;
      projected to be between 2 and 100 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Committee:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to each dose level increase or the initiation of Phase 2, a safety committee composed&#xD;
      of independent voting members and treating physician(s) will review toxicity and other&#xD;
      relevant data to determine suitability of dose escalation or expansion with regards to&#xD;
      patient safety. Interim assessments of toxicity will be conducted throughout the trial to&#xD;
      monitor for safety trends and identify any new or increased toxicity not previously&#xD;
      associated with the IPs.&#xD;

             non-squamous) with positive expression of MAGE-A3 (primary or metastatic lesion).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Phase 1: Have radiographic progression after treatment with at least 1 cycle of&#xD;
             platinum-doublet chemotherapy and/or at least one treatment of PD-1 or PD-L1 antibody&#xD;
             targeted therapy. Adjuvant therapy will count as a regimen if administered within 1&#xD;
             year before relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Phase 2: Have radiographic progression during or after treatment with anti-PD-1/PD-L1&#xD;
             antibody. Adjuvant therapy will count as regimen if administered within 1 year before&#xD;
             relapse.&#xD;
