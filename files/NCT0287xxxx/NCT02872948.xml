      The main objective of this study is to estimate the intrinsic diagnostic qualities of the&#xD;
      digital dPCR in the screening of T21 from a multicentrique sample of patients with&#xD;
      pregnancies at high risk of T21 (risk &gt; 1/250).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The profit expected from this technique is to propose to the encircled women a screening more&#xD;
      successful than that of the screening combined(organized) of the 1st quarter, simple of&#xD;
      realization and in a moderate cost. We thus propose here an original alternative(alternate)&#xD;
      method to the exclusive, expensive and binding techniques of top-debit(-flow). The recent&#xD;
      technical improvements and his(her,its) advantages medical - economic allow to envisage a&#xD;
      reliable, strong and long-lasting use of the dPCR in clinical routine in the DPNI of T21 in&#xD;
      most of the laboratories. This pilot project could serve for the later development of a study&#xD;
      of clinical validation multicentrique of large scale(big turntable ladder).&#xD;

      Context&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, non-invasive screening test for trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) is proposed to every&#xD;
      pregnant woman. This first trimester combined test consists of ultrasound nuchal translucency&#xD;
      measurement, associated with different maternal serum biochemical assay and maternal age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the discovery of the presence of cell-free fetal DNA in maternal plasma, the&#xD;
      noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), using mainly a massive parallel sequencing (MPS)&#xD;
      approach, has been introduced. The chromosomal origin of each sequenced plasma DNA molecule&#xD;
      and the over- or under-representation of any chromosome can be identified by MPS in maternal&#xD;
      plasma. The specificity and sensibility of such high-throughput techniques are excellent,&#xD;
      close to 100 %. However, MPS remains time-consuming, very expensive (&gt; 1000 euros per&#xD;
      patient) and can't be used in clinical routine in most genetics laboratories worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital PCR represents an interesting alternative to the MPS due to its targeted approach,&#xD;
      cost (&gt;10x less than MPS), speed and relative simplicity allowing a clinical routine&#xD;
      practice. However, its clinical an analytical relevance remains insufficiently demonstrated&#xD;
      in literature data . Therefore, our main objective is to evaluate the diagnosis accuracy of&#xD;
      noninvasive screening by PCR digital for Down syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results This study will assess the sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratio&#xD;
      with a satisfactory accuracy. The no call rate will be also evaluated and considered as a&#xD;
      positive test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The optimal number of replicates (leading to a false positive rate &lt;5%) will be determined&#xD;
      using a ROC curve. Our hypothesis is that the sensitivity of the screening test will be upper&#xD;
      to 95% with a false positive rate &lt;5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If results are conclusive, this pilot project will be a strong argument in favor of the&#xD;
      development of a further large scale study. It may challenge current screening strategy and&#xD;
      allow to propose an inexpensive, fast, and accessible NIPT of trisomy 21 to a large number of&#xD;
      laboratories in our territory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design We will evaluate this approach on a pregnant women cohort with high risk&#xD;
      for T21 (&gt;1/250), prospectively recruited from three regional hospitals with a cytogenetics&#xD;
      laboratory. We propose to preform single-blind retrospective analyses of cell free DNA of 100&#xD;
      pregnancies (including 70 euploid and 30 T21fetuses). Results obtained with the dPCR approach&#xD;
      will be compared with the fetal karyotype beforehand performed. Digital PCR analyses will be&#xD;
      performed at the Grenoble University Hospital, our team having a significant experience in&#xD;
      digital PCR technology. Digital PCR reactions will be done on a QuantStudio™ 3D&#xD;
      (LifeTechnologies) with the commercial high density chips etched with 20,000&#xD;
      consistently-sized nanoscale reaction wells. To improve the analytical sensitivity, 10&#xD;
      replicates will be performed for each patient.&#xD;
