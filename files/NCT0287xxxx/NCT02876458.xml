  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sudden cardiac death (SCD) remains a major public health issue with a low survival rate. The&#xD;
      most common cause of SCD is acute coronary artery occlusion. Several registry based studies&#xD;
      suggest that coronary angiography (CA) performed at admission followed if necessary by&#xD;
      coronary angioplasty improves in-hospital and long term survival. Recent guidelines recommend&#xD;
      performing an immediate CA in all survivors of SCD with no obvious non cardiac cause of&#xD;
      arrest. However there is a lack of randomized data on this topic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several retrospective studies have shown that if the post-resuscitation electrocardiogram&#xD;
      (ECG) shows ST segment elevation, the probability of finding an acute coronary artery lesion&#xD;
      during the CA is high (70-80%). In contrast, if no ST segment elevation is present the&#xD;
      probability is low (15-20%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performing an immediate CA in all survivors of SCD can be challenging. It requires admitting&#xD;
      these patients to centers with an intensive care unit and facilities allowing 24/24 7/7 CA.&#xD;
      It may increase the delay of performing other therapeutic modalities such as CT brain or&#xD;
      thorax scan to determine the cause of SCD. Performing the CA 48 to 96 hours after admission&#xD;
      would facilitate the management of these difficult patients. However if the cause of the&#xD;
      arrest is a coronary artery occlusion and there is a delay in reperfusion, the rate of&#xD;
      post-arrest shock and the mortality may increase. Therefore a randomized study comparing&#xD;
      immediate versus delayed (between 48 to 96 hours) CA in survivors of SCD with no obvious&#xD;
      non-cardiac cause of arrest is warranted.&#xD;

      The design consists in a multicenter national randomized open parallel group trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible patients with SCD will be included and randomized by the Emergency Medical&#xD;
      Service (EMS) to one of the 2 following arms: immediate CA vs delayed CA. Patients randomized&#xD;
      in the immediate CA group will be admitted directly to the catheterization laboratory.&#xD;
      Patients randomized in the delayed CA will be admitted to the intensive care unit and a CA&#xD;
      will be planned 48 to 96 hours after admission. Investigators can perform the CA in the&#xD;
      delayed group &lt; 48 hours if the following events appear:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ST segment elevation or new left bundle branch block on the ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Shock unresponsive to inotropes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;Electrical storm&quot; (repeated Ventricular Tachycardia (VT)/Ventricular Fibrillation (VF))&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Segmental hypokinesia or akinesia on an echocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiography and assessment of neurological status are done at discharge form the&#xD;
      Intensive Care Unit, at hospital discharge and during the follow-up visits (90 and 180 days).&#xD;
