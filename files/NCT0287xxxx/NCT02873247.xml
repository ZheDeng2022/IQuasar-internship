    <textblock>
      Patients who test Helicobacter pylori positive, are treated with antibiotics. However, due to&#xD;
      a number of factors (such as unknown treatment compliance, no standardized follow-up, ...), a&#xD;
      relative low eradication-percentage was reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators want to measure the anticipated improvement in&#xD;
      eradication-percentage due to the standardized treatment schedules (1st line, 2nd line and&#xD;
      further) and the optimized communication with the general practitioner and patients.&#xD;

      Patients who test Helicobacter pylori positive, are treated with antibiotics. However, due to&#xD;
      a number of factors (such as unknown treatment compliance, no standardized follow-up, ...), a&#xD;
      relative low eradication percentage was reported. Therefore, the investigators want to&#xD;
      measure the anticipated improvement in eradication percentage due to the standardized&#xD;
      treatment schemes (1st line, 2nd line and further) and the optimized communication with the&#xD;
      general practitioner and patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient is eligible (Helicobacter pylori positive) :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The standardized eradication scheme in 1st line is:&#xD;
&#xD;
           sequential therapy being the first 5 days (PPI 2x40mg/d + amoxicilline 2x1g/d), followed&#xD;
           by 5 days (PPI 2x40mg/d + clarithromycin 2x500mg/d + flagyl 2x500mg/d)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A standardized letter is sent to the general practitioner, mentioning the eradication&#xD;
           scheme, and the need to test for eradication success after 8 weeks. A copy of this&#xD;
           letter is being sent to the patient. An information folder about Helicobacter pylori&#xD;
           infection with instructions on what is expected from the patient, is sent to the&#xD;
           patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. After 8 weeks, a control helicobacter pylori breath test (An ureum breath test is a type&#xD;
           of test performed on air generated from the act of exhalation ; this test is specific to&#xD;
           detect Helicobacter pylori) is performed, and a questionnaire is filled in by the&#xD;
           patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. If the ureum breath test is positive, a 2nd line treatment is started = tryplera&#xD;
           schedule for 10 days (4x3 co/dag + PPI 2x40mg/d) (1 co tryplera contains 140mg&#xD;
           bismuthsubcitrate, 125mg metronidazole, 125mg tetracycline hydrochloride)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. A standardized letter is sent to the general practitioner, mentioning the 2nd line&#xD;
           eradication scheme, and the need to test for eradication success after 8 weeks. A copy&#xD;
           of this letter is being sent to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. After 8 weeks, a control helicobacter pylori breath test is performed, and a&#xD;
           questionnaire is filled in by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. If the breath test is positive, a 3rd line treatment is started, based on the results of&#xD;
           an antibiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. A standardized letter is sent to the general practitioner, mentioning the 3rd line&#xD;
           eradication schedule, and the need to test for eradication success after 8 weeks. A copy&#xD;
           of this letter is being sent to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. After 8 weeks, a control helicobacter pylori breath test is performed, and a&#xD;
           questionnaire is filled in by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall time-frame : a maximum of 100 helicobacter-positive patients will be recruited over a&#xD;
      period of 1 year. Included patients are followed up for 30 weeks maximally.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The presence of Helicobacter pylori is measured using a 13C-ureum breath test (performed minimally 8 wks after the eradication scheme with antibiotics)</measure>
    <time_frame>Each treatment cycle is about 10 weeks per patient. (10 days antibiotics treatment + 8wks waiting time before Helicobacter pylori breath test). Outcome measurement will be tested at week10, 20 or maximally week30 (depending on number of eradications)</time_frame>
    <description>From all included Helicobacter pylori infected patients, a breath test gives a pos/neg result for the presence of Helicobacter pylori. If not successful after a first antibiotics therapy of 10 days, a second-line antibiotics therapy will be initiated, followed by a breath test after minimally 8 weeks. If not successful after a second treatment, a third-line will be started + breath test to test the eradication. Overall, we aim at an eradication percentage of more than 48%.</description>
