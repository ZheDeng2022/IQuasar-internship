  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast screening is a service offered by the NHS to help detect breast cancer and&#xD;
      precancerous changes early at a time when treatment is more likely to be curative. An&#xD;
      effective service must reach the 'at risk' but asymptomatic population. Breast screening&#xD;
      uptake in London, consistently falls below the national target and is well below the national&#xD;
      average. Uptake in West London is particularly low, with boroughs in Inner North West London&#xD;
      having the some of lowest uptake rates in the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine text message reminders have proven effective at improving uptake of breast screening&#xD;
      appointments. However little attention is paid to the content of the messages. Previous&#xD;
      studies of text message reminders in other clinical areas have shown that the content of&#xD;
      these messages matters and some text messages are more effective than others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol describes the design of a randomized controlled trial to investigate the effect&#xD;
      of differently worded text messages on the engagement with breast screening in West London.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two intervention arms were designed taking into consideration results of a 1000 woman survey&#xD;
      to highlight the behavioural barriers that most predict attendance. The survey tested 15&#xD;
      behavioural constructs and the two that most strongly predicted history of attendance were&#xD;
      used to inform the text message content of the intervention arms for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this end, this randomised controlled trial (RCT) will test the current standard practice&#xD;
      text message reminder against two intervention text message trial arms informed by the above&#xD;
      described survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The setting is West of London Breast Screening Service and women aged 47-73 who are due for&#xD;
      screening will be randomized to receive one of the three trial arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the difference in uptake between trial arms. Further statistical&#xD;
      analysis will analyse the difference in uptake by age group, deprivation score and previous&#xD;
      attendance status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Result will inform how small changes to the word content may have significant effects on&#xD;
      attendance at screening mammogram appointments.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the UK breast cancer is the most common female cancer affecting 1 in 8 women, accounting&#xD;
      for 31% of all cancers and 15% of cancer deaths in women.1 The NHS breast screening programme&#xD;
      (NHSBSP) offers 3-yearly screening to women aged 50-70 years. A pilot of extended screening&#xD;
      ages of 47-73 is being trialed in some geographical areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2015, 75% of women in England attended breast screening. In the same year only 68.3% of&#xD;
      women in London and 65.9% in West London respectively had an up-to-day mammogram in the&#xD;
      previous 3 years. 2 This falls below both the national average and target uptake of 70%. The&#xD;
      success of a screening programme not only relies on the sensitivity of the screening tool and&#xD;
      availability of successful treatment but also on reaching the asymptomatic but at risk&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent evidence in breast screening has shown that a simple text message reminder (TMR) is&#xD;
      effective. 3,4. One randomized controlled trial showed an increase in attendance by as much&#xD;
      as 12%.5 As a result TMRs are being used more frequently by NHS organisations, but with&#xD;
      little consideration paid their word content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further research testing the word content of TMR to remind patients of routine outpatient&#xD;
      hospital appointments has shown that the word choice matters. The most effective message&#xD;
      reduced 'did not attend' rates by 3.4 percentage points compared to a control TMR at a London&#xD;
      Hospital. 6&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to test if the word content of TMRs affects the uptake of breast screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to collaborate with West of London Breast Screening Service&#xD;
      (WoLBSS) to test different TMRs through an RCT to increase screening uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will test the effect of differently worded TMRs on the uptake of breast screening&#xD;
      in eligible women in West London. This three-armed RCT will test two intervention arms&#xD;
      against the current control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current practice is for women to receive two TMRs at 7 and 4 days prior to their appointment.&#xD;
      Therefore the current message will be maintained as the control message for both TMR 1 (7&#xD;
      days prior to appointment) and TMR 2 (4 days prior to appointment). The intervention arms&#xD;
      will contain the intervention TMRs and will be sent out as both TMR1 and TMR2. During the&#xD;
      trial period women due for screening will be randomized to receive one of the three trial&#xD;
      arms (control, intervention arm 1 or intervention arm 2. The TMRs will be sent out 7 days and&#xD;
      4 days before the breast screening appointment during the trial period as they are currently&#xD;
      sent out as part of routine practice. Women will receive the same message on the 7th day and&#xD;
      the 4th day before their appointment. WoLBSS will inform the research team of a woman's&#xD;
      attendance status at the end of the screening rounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be run in West London in collaboration with WoLBSS, which currently provides&#xD;
      the routine TMR service based on data from a previous trial.5 The research team will work&#xD;
      closely with the WoLBSS team to run the RCT through the existing infrastructure used to send&#xD;
      out current messages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who are eligible and due for breast screening in West London.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who are not eligible for breast screening due to for example bilateral mastectomies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who have chosen to not have screening and have informed the screening centre or their&#xD;
      GP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any woman who chooses to not take part in screening or to receive a TMR and has informed the&#xD;
      screening centre or their GP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RCT will have three arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. control (current TMR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intervention 1 - Behavioural regulation TMR&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Intervention 2 - Priority TMR&#xD;
&#xD;
      The choice of the content of the intervention text messages has been based on a survey of&#xD;
      1000 women run by the research team that evaluated how 15 behavioural constructs predicted&#xD;
      the outcome measures of women's history of attendance and their intention to attend. Two&#xD;
      strong constructs that predict both history of attendance and intention to attend were&#xD;
      'behavioural regulation' i.e. making a plan/note in a diary to attend breast screening and&#xD;
      'priority' i.e. how much a woman feels that screening is a priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the word content of two TMRs was constructed to take these into account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both intervention TMRs have been reviewed and approved by the WoLBSS routine care team as&#xD;
      well as the clinical lead for screening and a Public Health Consultant in Cancer screening at&#xD;
      NHS England.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point is the rate of uptake of screening at the end of the screening round.&#xD;
      Trial arms will be powered and sample size collected to detect a 3% uptake in screening. The&#xD;
      trial will close when the sample size is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes are uptake according to age, deprivation score and previous history of&#xD;
      attendance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Timeline&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women will be routinely invited for their screening mammogram as per standard procedure&#xD;
      approximately three weeks before their appointment. The research team will then randomise an&#xD;
      anonymized list of women to receive one of the three TMRs. The TMR will then be sent at the&#xD;
      same times as the current standard TMRs are sent out 7 and 4 days prior to the appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated to detect a 3% difference in uptake between groups with a 5%&#xD;
      margin for type I and 20% margin for type II error. This expected improvement in uptake is&#xD;
      deemed to be both realistic and operationally significant to the service. The uptake in West&#xD;
      London in 2015 was 65.9%. The investigators therefore calculated a minimum sample size for&#xD;
      each trial arm to be 3,832 with a total sample size of 11,496.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each screening round WoLBSS will invite women for breast screening as per usual. It is&#xD;
      not possible to identify at the time of randomization which women have provided WoLBSS with&#xD;
      their phone number. For this reason all women due for screening will be randomised. However,&#xD;
      only women who have given their mobile phone number will be able to receive a TMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each screening round a list of women will be forward to iPlato Patient Care Messaging with&#xD;
      their allocated appointment date, time and location. The participant list will then be&#xD;
      randomised by iPlato into trial arms and allocated to receive one of the three TMRs using the&#xD;
      Mersenne Twister algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once randomised the list of women due for screening will be uploaded to the iPlato platform.&#xD;
      The iPlato system will link each patients NHS number to WoLBSS record and retrieve a mobile&#xD;
      phone number where one is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WoLBSS uses iPlato Patient Care Messaging currently to send out the existing text message&#xD;
      reminder. iPlato is a communication platform developed specifically for health services and&#xD;
      can send reminder messages on behalf of GPs and hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and management&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected by the WoLBSS IT system including the primary research outcome of&#xD;
      attendance status. iPlato will collect data on accuracy of phone numbers and messages&#xD;
      delivery status. Anonymised data will be retrieved and passed onto the research team. The&#xD;
      data will be handled on NHS N3 computers with password protection, the research team's&#xD;
      personal laptops with secure password protection and Imperial College London's secure virtual&#xD;
      private network. Any transmission of data via email will be within secure NHS.net and NHS&#xD;
      trust email accounts between WoLBSS and the research team and within the secure Imperial&#xD;
      College email accounts and the virtual private network amongst the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected will include the age, year of birth, first 3-4 digits of the postcode,&#xD;
      ethnicity, previous attendance history and availability of a mobile phone number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible that participants are subject to other trials however due to the nature of the&#xD;
      trial it is not appropriate to contact patients to find out. It is not necessary in terms of&#xD;
      impact on the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      The premise of the study is whether a subtle change in a text message can increase the number&#xD;
      of patients attending their breast screening appointment. A pre-warning that patients may&#xD;
      receive TMR that may be modified would undermine the premise of the study and affect results.&#xD;
      This is because of participation bias, which would indicate that subjects who know they are&#xD;
      participating in a trial are more likely to try and do what they think the researcher wants&#xD;
      them to do. Taking explicit consent would therefore also undermine the study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only women who have given them mobile phone number to WoLBSS directly, will be able to&#xD;
      receive a TMR prior to their appointment. Therefore they have in the past given explicit&#xD;
      consent to receive a TMR by the service. No woman who has not previously given her mobile&#xD;
      number to the service will receive a TMR.&#xD;
