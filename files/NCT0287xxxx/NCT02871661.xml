      INTRODUCTION: Vulvodynia (chronic vulvar pain in the absence of clinical findings) has a&#xD;
      negative impact over quality of life in women with this diagnose. The existing treatments,&#xD;
      however, are manifold but insufficient. This study aims to verify the effectiveness of&#xD;
      kinesiotherapy and electrotherapy as adjuvant methods in the treatment of vulvodynia.&#xD;
      METHODS: A single-blind randomized controlled trial will examine 58 women, divided into three&#xD;
      treatment arms: use of tricyclic antidepressant alone (hydrochloride Amitriptyline),&#xD;
      amitriptyline hydrochloride associated with pelvic floor muscle exercises and amitriptyline&#xD;
      hydrochloride associated with electrotherapy (interferential current). Exclusion criteria&#xD;
      are: presence of infections or genital cancers, chronic degenerative diseases; younger than&#xD;
      18 years, neurological disease that jeopardizes the contraction of the muscles of the pelvic&#xD;
      floor, taking antidepressant drugs that have interaction with amitriptyline hydrochloride and&#xD;
      being pacemakers use. The parameters analyzed before and after treatment will be: muscle&#xD;
      volume of the anus elevator and perfusion of the pudendal artery obtained with 3D ultrasound,&#xD;
      subjective pain in vaginal intercourse (visual analog scale), monthly frequency of vaginal&#xD;
      intercourse, pain referred within vulvar touch on physical examination (swab test from zero&#xD;
      to 10) and female sexual function (Female Sexual Function questionnaire - FSFI). There will&#xD;
      be a follow up of subjective pain in vaginal intercourse and monthly frequency of vaginal&#xD;
      intercourse obtained by telephone contact with the voluntary on one, six and twelve months&#xD;
      after the end of interventions. The data will be analyzed using Chi-square test of Pearson,&#xD;
      Fisher exact and Mann-Whitney. The beginning and end of treatment will be compared using the&#xD;
      Wilcoxon test (related samples) and McNemar (effect of the intervention), considering&#xD;
      statistical significance level of 5%. The software used is the statistical analysis software&#xD;
      (SAS) - Release 9.1, SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA, 2002-2003 and Statistical&#xD;
      Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) -Release 17.0.&#xD;

      GOALS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. General Check the effectiveness of physical therapy applied to the pelvic floor muscles&#xD;
           used as an adjunct to standard treatment (amitriptyline hydrochloride) on the&#xD;
           improvement of symptoms of vulvodynia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Specific&#xD;
&#xD;
      Check and compare in women with vulvodynia before and after being randomly assigned to three&#xD;
      treatment arms (drug only drug associated with therapeutic exercise or medication associated&#xD;
      with electrotherapy with CI):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain during intercourse and during the swab test obtained by Visual Analogue Scale&#xD;
           (VAS);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The scores obtained in the questionnaire Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The change in the volume of puborectal, pubococcygeus and iliococcygeal muscles accessed&#xD;
           through Tridimensional Ultrasound (US3D);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The variation of the perfusion of the pelvic floor muscles by pudendal artery obtained&#xD;
           by 3D ultrasound;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The effectiveness of therapeutic exercise in the improvement of vulvar pain to test swab&#xD;
           and sexual intercourse by penetration in women diagnosed with vulvodynia;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The effectiveness of electrical therapy with interferential current in the improvement&#xD;
           of vulvar pain to test swab and sexual intercourse by penetration of women diagnosed&#xD;
           with vulvodynia;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the effectiveness of electrical therapy and kinesiotherapy in the improvement of&#xD;
           vulvar pain;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the effectiveness of physical therapy as an adjunct to standard against standard&#xD;
           treatment alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECTS AND METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
           clinical trial randomized controlled single-blind. Designed according to the CONSORT&#xD;
           standards, pending completion of the project after approval by Brazil Platform for final&#xD;
           implementation, scheduled for July 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
           To calculate the sample size, we sought in literature studies addressing the main&#xD;
           variables to be analyzed in this study (FSFI score after physical therapy intervention&#xD;
           and medication versus medication, change in visual analog pain scale before and after&#xD;
           the intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study whose design and statistical analysis were closer than we propose in this&#xD;
           project was used to calculate the sample, and its purpose was to compare in women with&#xD;
           vulvodynia, the improvement in pain using the VAS pain and sexual function index using&#xD;
           the FSFI after undergoing sessions of transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS) (65).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Assuming type II alpha error probability equal to 0.05 and study of power equal to 80%,&#xD;
           and considering the average VAS score of 8 (± 3.4) and 2.2 (± 6.1), the sample size&#xD;
           calculation estimated using the Small software Stata 13.1 was n = 16 for each group,&#xD;
           totaling n = 48. However, as a study with follow-up two months and assuming loss of&#xD;
           follow-up of 20% of the total number of the sample, we assume a sampling size n = 58.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Variables and concepts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 Independent Variables Vulvodynia Characterized by present or absent, it is diagnosed by&#xD;
      the presence of vulvar pain sexual penetration or touch gynecological self-reported, burning&#xD;
      to light touch in the lobby (swab test [13]) and erythema. It can be classified as localized&#xD;
      or generalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Dependent Variables Muscle thickness - Measure cross the levator ani muscle given in&#xD;
      millimeters, obtained by 3D US in three situations: rest, maximum voluntary contraction and&#xD;
      Valsalva; Perfusion pudendal artery - blood flow of the pudendal artery, given in millimeters&#xD;
      per square centimeters (mm / cm2) obtained by 3D US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain referred to the swab test - referred pain to perform the swab test, playing with a swab&#xD;
      certain points of the vulvar vestibule, pointed using the visual analog scale (VAS) ranging&#xD;
      from zero to 10, where ten is the highest grade concerning the higher pain threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain said the vaginal penetration - mean referred pain during sexual intercourse with vaginal&#xD;
      penetration, pointed using the visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from zero to 10, where ten&#xD;
      is the maximum note to higher pain threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FSFI - female sexual function index, as measured by the score obtained by the&#xD;
      self-administered questionnaire FSFI (Female Sexual Function Index), which proposes to&#xD;
      evaluate women's sexual response in the areas: desire, arousal, vaginal lubrication, orgasm,&#xD;
      sexual satisfaction and pain. Assesses the relative strength of each field of female sexual&#xD;
      response and transform subjective measures in objective, quantifiable and analyzable data.&#xD;
      Applied in therapeutic exercise before and after the program applied to the pelvic floor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Control variables BMI: body mass index, obtained by dividing weight in kilograms by&#xD;
      height in meters squared. Categorized to assess the degree of obesity of an individual, it is&#xD;
      considered underweight when BMI &lt;20; ideal weight BMI = 20 to 25; overweight BMI = 26 to 30;&#xD;
      moderate obesity BMI = 31 to 35; severe obesity BMI = 36 to 40; Morbid obesity BMI = 41 to&#xD;
      50; super obesity BMI&gt; 50.&#xD;
