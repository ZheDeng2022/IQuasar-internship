  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      From 3 large patient databases, patients diagnosed with AMD who have never taken&#xD;
      levodopa(L-DOPA) containing medications have a mean age of diagnosis at 71 years. Patients&#xD;
      who have been treated with L-DOPA containing medications have a mean age of diagnosis of AMD&#xD;
      at 79 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      L-DOPA binds to GPR143 in the retinal pigment epithelium, and releases PEDF, which protects&#xD;
      the retina and downregulates VEGF, which is the cause of neovascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators will evaluate the safety and tolerability of carbidopa-levodopa in patients&#xD;
      with AMD, and measure the effects on surrogate functional biomarkers of AMD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of blindness, in individuals&#xD;
      over the age of 50, in the developed world(1,2). AMD becomes more common as people age, and&#xD;
      is more common in lightly pigmented individuals(3). AMD appears more common in patients with&#xD;
      Parkinson's Disease, than in those without(4). The AREDS nutritional supplements are&#xD;
      effective in slowing the progress of intermediate AMD(5). Most AMD is &quot;dry AMD&quot;, which&#xD;
      progresses relatively slowly and may impair vision, but usually does not lead to legal&#xD;
      blindness. There are two forms of AMD, &quot;wet AMD&quot; and geographic atrophy (GA), that can cause&#xD;
      more profound vision loss. In aggregate they occur in about 25% patients with AMD(5). Wet AMD&#xD;
      is due to new growth of abnormal blood vessels under the retina. The new blood vessels are&#xD;
      believed to be due to an excessive release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by&#xD;
      the retinal pigment epithelium(RPE) cells(6). Wet AMD is now effectively treated with&#xD;
      intraocular injections of VEGF inhibitors(2). Geographic Atrophy, the other form of advanced&#xD;
      AMD, represents focal death of the RPE cells and overlying neurosensory retina. There is no&#xD;
      current treatment for GA. It is suspected that GA is due in part to a localized inflammatory&#xD;
      response, damage to RPE cells and loss of RPE cell function(7). It may also be speculated&#xD;
      that stimulation of RPE cells to release a potent neurotrophic factor, pigment epithelium&#xD;
      derived factor (PEDF) may slow progression of GA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2008, Dr. Brian McKay identified a receptor, G protein coupled receptor #143(GPR143), on&#xD;
      the surface of RPE cells and discovered that L-DOPA was the natural ligand or stimulator of&#xD;
      GPR143(8). Dr McKay showed that treatment of RPE cells with exogenous L-DOPA resulted in the&#xD;
      release of additional PEDF. In subsequent work Dr McKay's group also showed that L-DOPA&#xD;
      stimulation of PEDF in RPE cells was also associated with a decrease in VEGF(9). Thus, Dr&#xD;
      McKay hypothesized that exogenous L-DOPA may prevent the onset of AMD or progression to wet&#xD;
      AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2015, Dr McKay and his associates published a paper that showed that patients, who had&#xD;
      been treated with L-DOPA, had a delay in the onset of AMD by 8 years, compared to patients&#xD;
      who had not been treated with L-DOPA(10). In addition, those who had AMD and went on to&#xD;
      develop wet AMD, did so 5 years later than those with no history of L-DOPA treatment(10).&#xD;
      L-DOPA is an intermediate in the pigmentation pathway. Dr McKay and his associates suggested&#xD;
      that the reason darkly pigmented races do not get AMD nearly as frequently as lighter&#xD;
      pigmented races, is that they produce more pigment, and thus more L-DOPA to stimulate GPR143&#xD;
      on RPE cells. According to this hypothesis, the stimulated RPE cells release PEDF and&#xD;
      decrease VEGF, which together are responsible for the protective effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since there are no established animal models for AMD, and L-DOPA has a good safety profile in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers and patients with Parkinson's disease(11), the Investigators propose a&#xD;
      prospective experiment to determine the safety and tolerability of L-DOPA, in a population of&#xD;
      patients with AMD. The participants will be made aware of potential side effects of L-DOPA,&#xD;
      which are listed in the Informed Consent, during the consent process. Adverse events will be&#xD;
      elicited by questioning the participants at each visit. The participants will also be advised&#xD;
      to call the site, if they have any medical problem between visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators will also use this safety study to examine whether L-DOPA has a positive&#xD;
      effect on surrogate biomarkers of AMD. The surrogate markers to be evaluated are dark&#xD;
      adaptation(12,13), best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), low luminance visual&#xD;
      acuity(LLVA)(14), and the size and numbers of drusen(15) and reticular pseudodrusen(16). A&#xD;
      previous trial, with retinol in 104 patients, significantly improved dark adaptation in 30&#xD;
      days.(17) Therefore, the Investigators expect to see improvement with L-DOPA in a relatively&#xD;
      short time. This study will also help the Investigators prepare for a Phase 3 study of L-DOPA&#xD;
      in AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacology of L-DOPA and carbidopa&#xD;
&#xD;
      L-DOPA is formed by 3-hydroxylation of tyrosine by tyrosine-3-monooxygenase (tyrosinase).(18)&#xD;
      The primary metabolic pathway of L-DOPA is decarboxylation by amino acid decarboxylase to&#xD;
      dopamine, which is responsible for most, but not all, of its pharmacologic effects and&#xD;
      toxicity. When carbidopa is administered with L-DOPA, systemic levels of L-DOPA double and&#xD;
      central nervous system (CNS) L-DOPA increases from about 1% of the administered dose to about&#xD;
      4%. Levodopa freely passes from the systemic circulation into the retina and brain, but&#xD;
      dopamine and carbidopa do not. Adverse events are markedly decreased when carbidopa is&#xD;
      administered with L-DOPA, because systemic levels of the toxic metabolite of L-DOPA,&#xD;
      dopamine, are markedly reduced. In most patients, 25 mg of carbidopa is sufficient to control&#xD;
      side effects of 100 mg of L-DOPA, primarily nausea(18), by 90%. However, some patients&#xD;
      require additional supplemental carbidopa. Carbidopa has very limited side effects when given&#xD;
      alone(18). Therefore, the Investigators plan to use 35 mg of carbidopa with each 100 mg of&#xD;
      levodopa, in order to control adverse events in almost all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      L-DOPA is the natural ligand for GPR143 in the RPE cells(8). The Investigators' intent is to&#xD;
      increase the L-DOPA available to RPE surface receptors (GPR 143) while minimizing peripheral&#xD;
      toxicity. This concept is unique, because all other uses of L-DOPA rely on CNS conversion of&#xD;
      L-DOPA to dopamine, in order to produce the desired effect(19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Carbidopa-levodopa 35-100 mg dosed hs for 45 days, followed by carbidopa-levodopa 35-100&#xD;
           mg dosed in the morning, with supper and hs for 45 days. The second dosing period is the&#xD;
           equivalent of a moderate dose of carbidopa-levodopa in patients with Parkinson's disease&#xD;
           (maximum daily dose 200-800 mg).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Placebo dosed hs for 45 days, followed by placebo dosed in the morning, with supper and&#xD;
           hs for 45 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo and active medication will be dosed as capsules, identical in appearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of participants: Not yet recruiting, stratified by non-study eye being normal, dry AMD&#xD;
      or wet AMD and randomized using a table of random numbers. Estimated screen failure rate is&#xD;
      50%. The sample size is based on a successful study treating patients with impaired dark&#xD;
      adaptation with retinol, which showed significant improvement in 30 days with 52 patients per&#xD;
      study arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration: 87-114 days (80-100 days of treatment). Visits 1 (screening) and 2(randomization)&#xD;
      can be scheduled within 1 week. The first visit after Randomization, Visit 3, will occur&#xD;
      40-50 days after Visit 2. Visit 4 (end of study) will occur 40-50 days after Visit 3. This&#xD;
      schedule allows a 10 day window for study visits, for logistic reasons and patient&#xD;
      convenience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall trial duration for enrollment and treatment, screening 5 patients per week, will be&#xD;
      approximately 10 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: A statistically significant improvement by carbidopa-levodopa treatment in&#xD;
