  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Voice disorders in teachers have a significant impact on communication, quality of life, and&#xD;
      economic costs to the healthcare system. We need to advance the prevention of voice disorders&#xD;
      in teachers by testing an online telepractice model with synchronous (in real-time) and&#xD;
      asynchronous (stored and accessed later) methods. The current study will investigate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the theoretically-driven Global Voice Prevention Model (GVPM) delivered by&#xD;
      two methods; 1) online telepractice (synchronous and asynchronous) and 2) traditional,&#xD;
      in-person for vocally healthy physical education and vocal music student teachers.&#xD;
      Effectiveness of the model will be assessed by voice-related measures captured daily on a&#xD;
      smartphone app during student teaching, matching the asynchronous aspects of the telepractice&#xD;
      model and representing the effects of vocal loading from teaching.&#xD;
