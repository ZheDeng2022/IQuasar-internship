      The purpose of the project is to improve the sleep quality and sleep duration of post 9/11&#xD;
      veterans seeking college degrees. Preliminary research findings within CSU's New Start for&#xD;
      Student Veterans program indicate veterans with service-related injuries report difficulties&#xD;
      with sleep quality and duration. The REST program will recruit 24 college veterans and engage&#xD;
      them in a seven-week multi component sleep improvement program using evidence-based&#xD;
      educational and behavioral change supports that are considered best practice for improving&#xD;
      sleep quality. The investigators' scientific objectives in this application are to establish&#xD;
      the efficacy of a group-based sleep education and sleep-skills intervention to improve sleep&#xD;
      quality and duration, and to advance understanding of relationships between participants'&#xD;
      sleep-related knowledge and behaviors associated with improved sleep quality and duration in&#xD;
      veterans with service-related injuries in college. The investigators will initially engage 8&#xD;
      participants to establish treatment fidelity and participant satisfaction of the 7-week group&#xD;
      intervention. This will be followed by engaging 16 additional participants in the 7-week&#xD;
      group intervention, 8 will be randomly placed as wait-list controls and then receive the&#xD;
      intervention. The 7-week group intervention will take place within the CSU Occupational&#xD;
      Therapy Department, and all assessments will be completed using a web-based survey.&#xD;

      Design: The investigators will complete a mixed-methods prospective longitudinal study with&#xD;
      pre and post intervention testing (component A; N = 8), followed by a mixed-methods&#xD;
      wait-listed cross-over controlled trial with pre and post intervention testing (component B;&#xD;
      N = 16). Within component A participants will complete pre-intervention assessments, complete&#xD;
      7-weeks of group intervention and weekly monitoring, and complete post-intervention&#xD;
      assessments and follow-up assessments 3 months later. Within component B, 8 participants will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to the early intervention group and 8 participants will be assigned to&#xD;
      the wait-listed cross-over (or late) intervention group. Participants in the early and late&#xD;
      groups will complete pre-intervention assessments at the same time. Participants in the early&#xD;
      intervention group will then complete 7-weeks of group intervention and weekly monitoring,&#xD;
      and complete post-intervention assessments immediately after the intervention and a follow-up&#xD;
      assessment 3 months later. Participants in the late intervention group will complete sleep&#xD;
      diary information for 7 randomly-chosen nights, a second pre-intervention assessment&#xD;
      approximately 8-weeks following their initial pre-intervention assessment, complete 7-weeks&#xD;
      of group intervention and weekly monitoring, and complete post-intervention assessments and&#xD;
      follow-up assessments 3 months later. All interventions will occur within the CSU&#xD;
      Occupational Therapy Department, all pre and post intervention assessments will be completed&#xD;
      using a web-based survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Active recruitment of study participants will occur through email and telephone&#xD;
      contacts to veterans engaged in ongoing CSU IRB-approved studies in which they have agreed to&#xD;
      being contacted regarding participation in future studies occurring within the Department of&#xD;
      Occupational Therapy and the New Start for Student Veterans Program. Participants will&#xD;
      receive a gift card of their choice for completing post-intervention assessments, whereas&#xD;
      participants assigned to the late group of Component B will receive an additional gift card&#xD;
      for completing their second pre-intervention assessment. Participants who complete the 7-&#xD;
      week group intervention and first of two post-intervention assessments will also be allowed&#xD;
      to keep the Fitbit wearable actigraph they have used within the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection: The investigators will complete a comprehensive evaluation at each&#xD;
      assessment period. Data collected will address 2 aims. Aim 1 will assess the fidelity and&#xD;
      participant satisfaction of a group-delivered sleep education and sleep skills intervention&#xD;
      for veterans with service-related injuries who are in college. The working hypothesis is that&#xD;
      a group-delivered sleep education and sleep skills intervention will be safe, demonstrate&#xD;
      adequate treatment fidelity, and participant satisfaction. Aim 2 will assess the efficacy of&#xD;
      a group-delivered sleep education and sleep skills intervention for veterans with&#xD;
      service-related injuries who are in college in terms of key variables of interest. The&#xD;
      working hypothesis is that participation in a group-delivered sleep education and sleep&#xD;
      skills intervention will result in improvements in participants' sleep quality, sleep&#xD;
      duration, and mental health. Further, through the evaluation of program data including&#xD;
      participants' attendance, sleep-related knowledge and behaviors, program adherence, and&#xD;
      qualitative interview data we seek to understand the key processes and outcomes associated&#xD;
      with intervention efficacy. Please see the Outcome Measures section of this protocol&#xD;
      registration for name and purpose of outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: All post 9/11 veteran participants will complete a 7-week group sleep education&#xD;
      and sleep skills intervention within the Department of Occupational Therapy. The&#xD;
      investigators will deliver a sleep education and sleep skills group-based intervention based&#xD;
      upon established best-practices for improving sleep quality and sleep quantity associated&#xD;
      with insomnia, specifically targeted to student veterans with service-related injuries. All&#xD;
      components of the intervention will be delivered by registered and licensed occupational&#xD;
      therapists practicing within the New Start for Student Veterans Program and the Department of&#xD;
      Occupational Therapy, which serves college veterans with service-related injuries at CSU and&#xD;
      Front Range Community College. For the duration of the study two local physicians, board&#xD;
      certified in Sleep Medicine and Psychiatry respectively will be available for consultation on&#xD;
      sleep issues related to veterans. The 7-week group intervention was developed to improve&#xD;
      sleep quality and sleep quantity through sleep-related education and behavioral goal setting&#xD;
      addressing: sleep monitoring with actigraph and sleep log, sleep education, sleep hygiene and&#xD;
      development and maintenance of good sleep habits, stimulus control for sleep preparation, and&#xD;
      mindfulness/ yoga for sleep preparation and daily stress reduction. Participants will also&#xD;
      meet individually either in person or by telephone on a weekly basis with a registered and&#xD;
      licensed occupational therapist, experienced in working with student veterans with&#xD;
      service-related injuries, and knowledgeable of the sleep-related education used within the&#xD;
      intervention. Individualized meetings will be used to assure: 1) understanding and adherence&#xD;
      in the use of sleep monitoring actigraphy and sleep diaries, and 2) establishing and&#xD;
      monitoring participants' individualized goals related to sleep skills behaviors. Participants&#xD;
      will also have access to an occupational therapist from CSU's Assistive Technology and&#xD;
      Resource Center, experienced in working with veterans with service-related injuries, to&#xD;
      support the use of Fitbit sleep actigraph and associated mobile sleep applications to ensure&#xD;
      understanding of Fitbit use, integration (sync) of Fitbit and mobile application, and&#xD;
      establishment of an anonymous web-based profile for monitoring sleep-related data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: For Aim 1, the investigators will assess the intervention fidelity and&#xD;
      participant satisfaction of a group delivered sleep education and sleep skills intervention,&#xD;
      the investigators will report proportions of educational content and behavioral goals&#xD;
      established, and proportions of participants who rate the interventions as enjoyable (1-4 on&#xD;
      Likert scale). Descriptive statistics will be used to examine means and variances of key&#xD;
      constructs of interest. Change in key variables over the 7-week intervention will be&#xD;
      inspected via individual growth charts. Attendance, attrition, and adverse events will be&#xD;
      reported as proportions. The investigators will use focus groups to formally evaluate the&#xD;
      program, and to elicit suggestions for program improvement. Importantly, participants will be&#xD;
      asked to describe changes that have occurred during the intervention and why they think the&#xD;
      sleep education and behavioral sleep goals helped improve sleep quality, sleep quantity or&#xD;
      other sleep-related variables, such as mindfulness, physical, mental, and social health&#xD;
      domains. Qualitative analytic software (e.g., Atlas TI) will be used to code segments of&#xD;
      qualitative data. The investigators will review the text and identify emergent themes and use&#xD;
      an iterative consensus building process to generate themes and codes for participants and&#xD;
      their spouses/ significant others. For Aim 2 quantitative data will be analyzed in two ways.&#xD;
      First, for constructs measured at pre and post intervention only, a repeated-measures ANOVA&#xD;
      will be conducted to determine if post-intervention scores differ significantly across the&#xD;
      early and delayed conditions. Second, for the sleep variables, which will be collected on a&#xD;
      daily basis during the intervention, a time-series approach will be used to examine within&#xD;
      person change in these constructs over time. This type of analysis models the effect of an&#xD;
      intervention on a meaningful outcome collected regularly over time - with measurements before&#xD;
      the implementation of the intervention, during the intervention, and ideally after the&#xD;
      intervention. Using time-series models, the effect of an intervention can be estimated after&#xD;
      adjusting for serial dependence and any other measured shifts (e.g., day of the week, length&#xD;
      of the day, mid-terms/finals, outside temperature), through the specification of linear&#xD;
      models that capture increases or decreases in the mean level or slope of the time-series.&#xD;
      Specifically, an Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model will be used to&#xD;
      examine intervention effects of the program for the identified outcomes.&#xD;
