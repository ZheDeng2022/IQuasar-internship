    <textblock>
      Due to the relapsing nature of alcoholism, excessive alcohol consumption represents a&#xD;
      significant cost to US society ($249 billion in 20101). About 64% of those entering treatment&#xD;
      will relapse within one year. New interventions targeting the underlying brain biomarkers of&#xD;
      relapse vulnerability hold significant promise in reducing this critical public health&#xD;
      problem. Using resting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we have identified brain&#xD;
      biomarkers that support long-term abstinence and brain biomarkers that predict relapse. Our&#xD;
      data point to specific brain biomarkers that index higher relapse vulnerability at 11 weeks&#xD;
      of abstinence. Many individuals, however, have already relapsed by this time. It is unknown&#xD;
      whether these biomarkers can be identified earlier during the recovery period. We need to&#xD;
      investigate whether this biomarker of relapse vulnerability can be identified during earlier&#xD;
      stages of abstinence. Earlier identification of this biomarker will give valuable information&#xD;
      for timely targeted interventions (e.g. closer monitoring, longer stay in treatment program,&#xD;
      neuromodulation), increasing the chances of maintaining abstinence. The overall objective of&#xD;
      this study is to identify biomarkers of relapse during early abstinence (2-3 weeks of&#xD;
      abstinence). A secondary objective is to evaluate whether non-imaging measures such as&#xD;
      craving6 and executive function7 add value to prediction models. Findings from this proposal&#xD;
      will provide insight into the neurobiology of relapse vulnerability that will inform new&#xD;
      treatment strategies needed to improve treatment outcome.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the relapsing nature of alcoholism, excessive alcohol consumption represents a&#xD;
      significant cost to US society ($249 billion in 2010). About 64% of those entering treatment&#xD;
      will relapse within one year. Development of new and improved treatments that could be&#xD;
      personalized to maximize the chance of maintaining abstinence in the first year will require&#xD;
      advancement in understanding the behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying vulnerability to&#xD;
      relapse during early abstinence. New interventions targeting the underlying brain biomarkers&#xD;
      of relapse vulnerability hold significant promise in reducing this critical public health&#xD;
      problem. Using resting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we have identified brain&#xD;
      biomarkers that support long-term abstinence and brain biomarkers that predict relapse. Our&#xD;
      cross-sectional and longitudinal findings provide evidence that higher functional&#xD;
      connectivity (FC), particularly between nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and dorsolateral prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex (DLPFC) is a potential brain biomarker that supports abstinence. Resting NAcc-DLPFC FC&#xD;
      is graded depending on abstinence length, with higher FC in long-term abstinent alcoholics (7&#xD;
      years of abstinence) than controls and intermediate FC in short-term abstinent alcoholics (11&#xD;
      weeks of abstinence). Further, lower NAcc-DLPFC FC at 11-weeks of abstinence can be a&#xD;
      predictor of subsequent relapse (with 74% accuracy). Our data point to specific brain&#xD;
      biomarkers that index higher relapse vulnerability at 11 weeks of abstinence. Many&#xD;
      individuals, however, have already relapsed by this time and were not included in the studies&#xD;
      above. It is unknown whether these biomarkers can be identified earlier during the recovery&#xD;
      period. We need to investigate whether this biomarker of relapse vulnerability can be&#xD;
      identified during earlier stages of abstinence. Earlier identification of this biomarker will&#xD;
      give valuable information for timely targeted interventions (e.g. closer monitoring, longer&#xD;
      stay in treatment program, neuromodulation), increasing the chances of maintaining&#xD;
      abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our long-term goal is to use identified brain and behavioral biomarkers to facilitate the&#xD;
      development of new, personalized treatments that will support enduring abstinence in&#xD;
      addiction. The overall objective of this study is to identify biomarkers of relapse during&#xD;
      early abstinence (2-3 weeks of abstinence). A secondary objective is to evaluate whether&#xD;
      non-imaging measures such as craving and executive function add value to prediction models.&#xD;
      Findings from this study will provide insight into the neurobiology of relapse vulnerability&#xD;
      that will inform new treatment strategies needed to improve treatment outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA 1: To evaluate prediction accuracy of FC measures in individuals with alcohol use disorder&#xD;
      (AUD) during early (2-3 weeks) abstinence. To evaluate whether non-imaging measures (e.g.&#xD;
      craving, executive function) add value to FC prediction models we will test prediction models&#xD;
      using (i) only imaging variables (FC during task and rest fMRI), (ii) only non-imaging&#xD;
      variables, and (iii) a combination of imaging and non-imaging variables as predictors of time&#xD;
      to relapse. Hypothesis: Based on compensatory mechanisms hypothesis, we expect that&#xD;
      subsequent abstainers will have stronger NAcc-DLPFC FC when compared to subsequent relapsers&#xD;
      and controls. Pilot data suggests that a combination of imaging and non-imaging variables&#xD;
      will have high prediction accuracy. SA 2. To expand our examination of NAcc-DLPFC FC beyond&#xD;
      resting state we will use the Reversal Learning (RL) task, which involves executive&#xD;
      functioning and reward processing. Hypothesis: Pilot data suggests that subsequent abstainers&#xD;
      will show higher task-related NAcc FC than relapsers and controls. Exploratory Aim: We will&#xD;
      explore whether the strength of resting NAcc-DLPFC FC changes after performing the RL task.&#xD;
      We will collect rest fMRI data before and after RL task performance in the scanner.&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Based on previous findings of increased task-evoked activity in these regions, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that patients will show increased resting NAcc-DLPFC FC after performing the RL&#xD;
      task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIGNIFICANCE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Addiction treatment outcomes are poor. Alcohol use disorder (AUD) in the U.S. remains an&#xD;
      important public health problem with an estimated total annual cost to society of $249.5&#xD;
      billion. The chronic and relapsing nature of AUD is a major obstacle to successful recovery.&#xD;
      We lack tools to subtype in alcohol use disorder (AUD). Subtyping in clinical populations can&#xD;
      be an effective approach to model targeted interventions. For example, targeted treatment for&#xD;
      breast cancer patients based on individual tumor estrogen receptor typing (biomarker) has&#xD;
      improved outcomes from a 25 to 77% survival rate; there has not been a similar improvement in&#xD;
      outcome for AUD treatment. We need to identify biomarkers in AUD that predict relapse and&#xD;
      guide the development and selection of treatment based on subtypes to increase the chances of&#xD;
      achieving long-term abstinence.&#xD;
