  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to identify the responding patients with vascular filling test, this research aims&#xD;
      to compare the performance of the increased flow in the femoral artery to the performance of&#xD;
      the blood pressure increase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reference measurement will increase cardiac output measured by ultrasound.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is notable that in the intensive care patient, the ultrasound measurement of cardiac flow&#xD;
      is not always possible, especially in case of mechanical ventilation, often responsible for&#xD;
      air interposed between the ultrasound probe and the heart, thus stopping the ultrasound. Use&#xD;
      the blood pressure increase as a reflection of the increase in cardiac flow induced by fluid&#xD;
      replacement is not a fully satisfactory alternative since its performance is at best just&#xD;
      acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flow measurement in the femoral artery could be an attractive alternative to the cardiac&#xD;
      output measurement as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is easy: the femoral vascular ultrasound is booming with resuscitators, including the&#xD;
           laying of intravascular catheter or thrombosis diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is painless: it is based on the application of the ultrasound probe on the root of&#xD;
           the thigh for less than 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is not subject to limitations echogenicity by interposition of air (except in&#xD;
           exceptional circumstances)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It measures the same physiological parameter (arterial flow) as measuring ultrasound&#xD;
           cardiac output (based on measurement of the flow at the outflow tract of the left&#xD;
           ventricle).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathophysiology study, multicenter (conducted in three French ICUs), open, prospective in&#xD;
      order to evaluate the flow doppler from the femoral artery as a reflection of cardiac flow in&#xD;
      a vascular fluid test in patient with signs of acute circulatory failure in intensive care&#xD;
      unit.&#xD;

        One hundred and twenty adult patients hospitalized in one of the participating ICUs, will&#xD;
        be included (see the justification required number of subjects in &quot;statistics&quot;) if&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They are already carrying an intra-arterial catheter (femoral or radial).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They exhibit acute circulatory failure signs (see below)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The doctor in charge prescribed a vascular fluid replacement, regardless of the&#xD;
             purposes of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  vascular fluid replacement&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  initiation or catecholamine&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  or increase (&gt; 10%) of catecholamine dosage.&#xD;
