  <brief_summary>

      This trial is to assess the safety &amp; efficacy of the Combination of Pembrolizumab and&#xD;
      Lenalidomide in the management of patients with Relapsed Hodgkin Lymphoma.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an emerging clinical data to confirm that Programmed death-1 (PD-1)blockade is safe&#xD;
      and viable in lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the novel immune platform of pembrolizumab and&#xD;
      lenalidomide, will be safe and well tolerated in patients with Relapsed Refractory (RR)&#xD;
      Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and that this combination will result in&#xD;
      a complete response (CR) rate of 50% in patients with RR HL.&#xD;
