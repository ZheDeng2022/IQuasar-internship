      Study CC-90011-ST-001 is an open-label, Phase 1, dose escalation and expansion,&#xD;
      First-In-Human (FIH) clinical study of CC-90011 in subjects with advanced unresectable solid&#xD;
      tumors (enriched for grade 2 NENs, grade 2 NETs and NECs) and R/R NHL (MZL, including&#xD;
      extranodal MZL [EMZL], splenic MZL [SMZL], nodal MZL [NMZL], and histologic transformation of&#xD;
      MZL). The dose escalation part (Part A) of the study will explore escalating oral doses of&#xD;
      CC-90011 to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CC-90011. The expansion part (Part&#xD;
      B) will further evaluate the safety and efficacy of CC-90011 administered at or below the MTD&#xD;
      in 3 selected expansion cohorts of approximately 10-20 evaluable subjects each, in order to&#xD;
      further define the RP2D.&#xD;

&#xD;
             • Acute symptoms must have resolved and based on investigator assessment in&#xD;
             consultation with the Medical Monitor, there are no sequelae that would place the&#xD;
             subject at a higher risk of receiving study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         25. Previous SARS-CoV-2 vaccine within 14 days of C1D1.&#xD;
