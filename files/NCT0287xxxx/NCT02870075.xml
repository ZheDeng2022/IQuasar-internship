      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether dietary conditions (fed versus fasted)&#xD;
      affects the acute responses to exercise.&#xD;

      Pre-trial assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      V̇O2max measurement V̇O2max was determined using an incremental continuous treadmill test&#xD;
      until the point of volitional exhaustion. For most participants, a treadmill speed of 4 km/h&#xD;
      and gradient of 8.5% was chosen. Participants were tested at this speed and gradient with the&#xD;
      speed increased by 1 km/h after every 3 min stage. One minute expired air samples were&#xD;
      collected into Douglas bags (Douglas Bags, Hans Rudolph, MO, USA), and RPE and heart rates&#xD;
      were measured in the final minute of each stage and also at the point of volitional&#xD;
      exhaustion, defined as when the participant indicated that only 1 min remained until fatigue.&#xD;
      Samples were analysed for relative expired fractions of oxygen and carbon dioxide gas&#xD;
      (Servomex, Crowborough, UK) and the total volume with in the bag was measured using a dry gas&#xD;
      meter (Harvard Apparatus, Kent, UK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity assessment Participants wore a combined heart rate/accelerometer monitor&#xD;
      for one week to assess their habitual physical activity energy expenditure (Actiheart,&#xD;
      Cambridge Neurotechnology Ltd., Cambridge, UK). This was attached to the left chest via 2&#xD;
      adhesive ECG pads for 24 hours per day except for during showering/bathing/swimming.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body composition analysis Body mass was measured using digital scales post-void (TANITA&#xD;
      corp., Tokyo, Japan). Waist and hip circumference was assessed according to World Health&#xD;
      Organisation guidelines. Body composition was determined using Dual energy X-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry (Discovery, Hologic, Bedford, UK). Abdominal subcutaneous and visceral adipose&#xD;
      tissue mas was estimated from a central region between L1-L4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial days In the 72 h prior to each main trial, participants were asked to refrain from&#xD;
      performing any strenuous physical activity and from consuming alcohol/caffeine for 48 h prior&#xD;
      to the main trials. A dietary record was completed 48 h before the first main trial and&#xD;
      participants were asked to replicate this diet prior to their second main trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On main trial days, participants arrived at the laboratory between 8-9am following a 12 h&#xD;
      fast. After anthropometric measurements, participants rested on a bed for 15 minutes,&#xD;
      followed by four 5 min expired gas samples collections to determine resting metabolic rate&#xD;
      (RMR) using substrate oxidation under resting conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants then either consumed a meal (FED) or remained fasting (FASTED) and cannula blood&#xD;
      samples were taken every 15 minutes for the following 60 minutes. A further blood sample was&#xD;
      collected at 120 min immediately before the walking protocol. In both the FASTED and FED&#xD;
      treatments, participants walked on the treadmill at 60% V̇O2max for 60 minutes and one minute&#xD;
      of expired air samples, ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and heart rate were collected at&#xD;
      5, 20, 40 and 60 minutes. After finishing the exercise, another blood sample was immediately&#xD;
      collected and participants then rested for a further 60 minutes. At this point, a second&#xD;
      adipose tissue and final blood sample was taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adipose tissue culture and gene expression After adipose tissue biopsy and cleaning, tissue&#xD;
      was minced to approximately 5-10 mg and directly placed in sterile culture plates (Nunc,&#xD;
      Roskilde, Denmark) with endothelial cell basal media (ECBM) containing 0.1% fatty acid-free&#xD;
      bovine serum albumin 100 U ml-1 penicillin and 0.1 mg ml-1 streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich,&#xD;
      Gillingham, UK). Adipose tissue was incubated with a final ratio of 100mg tissue per 1 ml&#xD;
      ECBM media for 3 hours. A 37°C, 5% CO2 and 95 ± 5% relative humidity incubator was used&#xD;
      (MCO-18A1C CO2 incubator; Sanyo, Osaka, Japan). Media was transferred to sterile eppendorfs&#xD;
      and stored at -80°C after 3 hours incubation. Approximately 200 mg adipose tissue was&#xD;
      homogenised in 5ml Trizol in an RNase/DNase-free sterile tube (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) and&#xD;
      stored at -80°C before further analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size There is no data regarding how different dietary status (fed versus fasted)&#xD;
      affects the acute responses to exercise on overweight males. However, a previous study using&#xD;
      a similar meal showed that feeding had an enormous effect on the use of lipid during exercise&#xD;
      - and thus indicates that the role of adipose tissue during exercise would be potentially&#xD;
      very different. In order to see an effect on lipid oxidation during exercise with 95% power&#xD;
      and 5% alpha, we would require 6-8 participants. To ensure that these results are&#xD;
      generalizable and also to account for greater variability in other outcome, we recruited a&#xD;
      total 10 participants from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data was presented as mean ± standard error of mean (SEM). Incremental area under curve&#xD;
      (iAUC) was calculated using the trapezoid method and differences between trials analysed&#xD;
      using paired t-tests. Glucose, insulin, NEFA, TAG, adipokines, and cell culture outcomes were&#xD;
      determined using a two-way ANOVA with repeated measures using SPSS version 22 (IBM, Armonk,&#xD;
      NY, USA). Where significant interactions (trial × time) were found, a post hoc analysis was&#xD;
      applied using t-test with the Holm-Bonferroni correction. Single comparisons used a t-test or&#xD;
      non-parametric equivalent. Statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05.&#xD;
