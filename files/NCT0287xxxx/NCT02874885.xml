  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study looks at the level of circulating tumor elements (cancer cells or DNA pieces&#xD;
      floating in the blood) and how it may be related to how the tumor responds to standard&#xD;
      treatment in patients with rectal cancer that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes&#xD;
      (locally advanced). Researchers will also compare the level and genetic characteristics of&#xD;
      circulating tumor elements between individuals with rectal cancer and healthy individuals to&#xD;
      understand how they may change over time. Information from this study may help researchers&#xD;
      better understand rectal cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To establish the rate of circulating tumor elements (CTE), including but not limited to&#xD;
      circulating tumor cells and circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) detection in&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC), relative to other stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess changes in detected CTEs associated with neoadjuvant therapy in patients with&#xD;
      LARC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To correlate CTEs with neoadjuvant treatment response as an indicator of disease risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and healthy participants undergo collection of blood sample at baseline. Patients&#xD;
      may also undergo collection of blood sample collections during tumor surgery, 4 weeks after&#xD;
      surgery or after completion of treatment if you are not surgery, 8 weeks after the last dose&#xD;
      of chemotherapy, 1 year after surgery or 1 year after completion of treatment if not having&#xD;
      surgery, 2 years after surgery or 2 years after completion of treatment if not having&#xD;
      surgery, and within 6 years after treatment or at the end of the 6 year follow-up if the&#xD;
      disease gets worse with treatment or comes back.&#xD;

    <measure>Proportion of treatment naive locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) patients with circulating tumor cells (CTC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 6 years</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of patients with any CTC will be calculated with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Additionally, the actual CTC count will be plotted with a box-plot. Proportions of patients with 2 or more, and 3 or more CTCs will be calculated. Will also explore correlations between the presence of 1 or more CTC and primary tumor characteristics using Chi-Squared or Fischer's exact tests as appropriate.</description>

    <measure>Change in circulating tumor cells status</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks after completion of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A McNemar's test will be used to test whether neoadjuvant therapy (NEO) provided any improvement in the proportion of patients with any CTC. The CTC counts at baseline versus 8 weeks after completion of treatment will be compared with a paired t-test.</description>
