  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard or usual treatment for this disease is treatment with drugs and other treatments&#xD;
      that may help to make a patient better or may improve their quality of life. This treatment&#xD;
      is known as &quot;best supportive care&quot; (BSC). Although patients with best supportive care can&#xD;
      feel better for some months, the cancer usually continues to grow.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Durvalumab is a new type of drug for many types of cancer. Laboratory tests show that it&#xD;
      works by allowing the immune system to detect cancer and reactivate the immune response. This&#xD;
      may help to slow down the growth of cancer or may cause cancer cells to die. Durvalumab has&#xD;
      been shown to shrink tumours in animals and has been studied in a few people and seems&#xD;
      promising but it is not clear if it can offer better results than standard treatment alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tremelimumab is a new type of drug for various types of cancers. It works in a similar way to&#xD;
      durvalumab and may improve the effect of durvalumab. This may also help slow the growth of&#xD;
      the cancer cells or may cause cancer cells to die. Tremelimumab has been shown to shrink&#xD;
      tumours in animals and has been studied in a few people and seems promising but it is not&#xD;
      clear if it can offer better results than standard treatment alone when used with durvalumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combinations of durvalumab and tremelimumab have also been studied and when combined have&#xD;
      been shown to increase tumour shrinkage in animals compared to either drug alone and while&#xD;
      the combination has been studied in a few people, it is not clear if it can offer better&#xD;
      results than standard treatment.&#xD;
