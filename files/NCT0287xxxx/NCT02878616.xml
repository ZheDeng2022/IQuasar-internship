      Investigate whether concomitant treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) can alter&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of LFG316 to an extent which would necessitate dose&#xD;
      adaptation for LFG316 in pre-sensitized end-stage renal disease patients awaiting kidney&#xD;
      transplantation&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Adult men or women 18-70 years of age suffering from end-stage renal disease and who&#xD;
             are on chronic dialysis therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Candidates for kidney transplantation who are pre-sensitized and will be undergoing&#xD;
             desensitization therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Written informed consent must be obtained before any assessment is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Able to communicate well with the investigator, to understand and comply with the&#xD;
             requirements of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Recipients who are ABO compatible with donor allograft.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients awaiting kidney allograft from a living or deceased donor. For patients&#xD;
             awaiting transplant from a living donor, kidney transplantation must only occur after&#xD;
             28 days post-LFG316 infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. History of vaccination with meningococcus and pneumococcus between 2 weeks and 36&#xD;
             months prior to dosing. Documentation is required. If patients have not been&#xD;
             vaccinated, they must be vaccinated at least 2 weeks prior to dosing. The choice of&#xD;
             vaccine(s) should take into account the serotypes prevalent in the geographic areas in&#xD;
             which study patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients requiring or undergoing peritoneal dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with a known contraindication to treatment with blood products.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with a known pro-thrombotic disorder and/or history of thrombosis or&#xD;
             hyper-coagulable state, excluding hemodialysis venous access clotting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who have positive PCR results for hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C, and/or&#xD;
             history of immunodeficiency diseases, including a positive HIV (ELISA and Western&#xD;
             blot) test result.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients at risk for tuberculosis (TB)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with any severe, progressive or uncontrolled acute or chronic medical&#xD;
             condition not related to end-stage renal disease (such as uncontrolled infectious&#xD;
             disease or sepsis), clinical laboratory abnormalities at screening or baseline that in&#xD;
             the investigator's opinion would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this&#xD;
             study, or known active presence of malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Women of child-bearing potential, unless highly effective methods of contraception are&#xD;
             used during dosing and for 50 days after the last dose of LFG316, or sexually active&#xD;
             males unwilling to use a condom during intercourse while taking investigational drug&#xD;
             and for 50 days after the last dose of LFG316.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.&#xD;
