  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in France, Europe and the world. 50% of&#xD;
      lung cancers are of the adenocarcinoma subtype. 60% of patients present with a metastatic&#xD;
      disease (stage IV) at the time of diagnosis. Approximately 10% of patients present with a&#xD;
      mutation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) requiring an EGFR tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), namely erlotinib, gefitinib or afatinib. For the majority of&#xD;
      chemotherapy-naïve patients without addictive mutation, platinum-based chemotherapy,&#xD;
      frequently the platinum - pemetrexed doublet, provides disease control rate of up to 70% and&#xD;
      improves survival from approximately 4.5 with best supportive care alone to 15 months.&#xD;
      However, patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) usually relapse within 4 to 6&#xD;
      months and benefit from a second-line chemotherapy. Authorized drugs in this setting are&#xD;
      pemetrexed, docetaxel and erlotinib. The prescription of erlotinib for unselected patients&#xD;
      whose tumor does not harbor an EGFR mutation is questionable . In the second line setting,&#xD;
      docetaxel provides less than 10% of partial responses and progression-free survival of 10 to&#xD;
      12 weeks. There are no standard options following failure of two previous lines of standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy. In view of these modest results, new agents and therapeutic strategies are&#xD;
      greatly needed for this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurotensin (NTS) is a 13 amino acids peptide, present and biologically active in the central&#xD;
      nervous system and in periphery. At the peripheral level, NTS is released by the endocrine&#xD;
      cells of the intestinal mucosa after meals and acts as an endocrine hormone involved in the&#xD;
      postprandial regulation of the motor functions of the gastrointestinal tract. The effects of&#xD;
      NTS are mediated by three subtypes of receptor: NTSR1 and NTSR2 exhibit high and low affinity&#xD;
      for NTS, respectively, and belong to the family of G protein receptors; NTSR3 is a single&#xD;
      transmembrane domain receptor. Exogenous activation of NTSR1 leads to cell proliferation,&#xD;
      survival, mobility and invasion in cancer cells from diverse origin. These effects are the&#xD;
      result from the activation of kinases and effectors, such as PKC, MAPK, FAK, RHO-GTPase, RAS&#xD;
      and Src. The PKC activation may induce MAPK by direct stimulation of Raf-1, or by&#xD;
      transactivation of the EGFR. The activation of MAPK via NTSR1 is mainly associated with&#xD;
      uncontrolled cell growth. Both NTS and NTSR1 are expressed in 40% of lung tumors, whereas&#xD;
      they are never expressed in the normal tissue. NTSR1 high expression is a negative prognostic&#xD;
      factor in stage I to III operated lung adenocarcinomas. Sustained stimulation of NTSR1&#xD;
      results in the activation of MMP1, the release of EGF &quot;like&quot; ligands such as HB-EGF as well&#xD;
      as neuregulin 1 NGR1 (a specific ligand for HER3) followed by EGFR, HER2 and HER3&#xD;
      overexpression and activation. Accordingly, xenografted tumors expressing NTS and NTSR1 show&#xD;
      a positive response to erlotinib, whereas tumors void of NTSR1 expression have no detectable&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Afatinib (BIBW2992) is a small molecule, selective and irreversible erbB family blocker. In&#xD;
      preclinical models it effectively inhibits EGFR, HER2 and HER4 phosphorylation resulting in&#xD;
      tumour growth inhibition and regression of established subcutaneous tumours derived from four&#xD;
      human cell-lines known to co-express ErbB receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our claim is that patients harbouring the NTS/NTSR complex, without EGFR mutation, will&#xD;
      respond to afatinib due to the sustained activation of EGFR/HER2 under neurotensin&#xD;
      activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presently, only EGFR mutated tumors are eligible to receive EGFR TKI representing 10% of all&#xD;
      lung cancer patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of afatinib, an EGFR&#xD;
      TKI, on lung adenocarcinomas, EGFR wild-type, bearing the NTS/NTSR1 complex with a high level&#xD;
      of expression. This subpopulation of patients represents approximately 20% of lung&#xD;
      adenocarcinomas.&#xD;
