      Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a temporary mechanical circulatory support&#xD;
      device for cardiogenic shock (CS) patients. During ECMO support, renal replacement therapy&#xD;
      (RRT) facilitate more rapid metabolic or uremic control and more effective prevention and&#xD;
      management of fluid overload which happened in critical state. CS patients who are likely to&#xD;
      receive ECMO support will be enrolled and randomized with a 1:1 allocation to a simultaneous&#xD;
      RRT arm vs. standard care arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The patients in the simultaneous RRT arm will receive RRT when ECMO is commenced.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The patients in the standard care arm will not receive RRT when ECMO is commenced. Only&#xD;
           when a patient demonstrates AKI and fulfills any one of the criteria of the conventional&#xD;
           RRT indication during ECMO support or after ECMO weaning, conventional-indication RRT&#xD;
           would be delivered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is all-cause 30-day mortality after ECMO is commenced&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a temporary mechanical circulatory support&#xD;
      device for cardiogenic shock (CS) patients. Patients with fluid overload (FO) and sever&#xD;
      metabolic disorder in the early phase of ECMO support exhibit higher hospital mortality.&#xD;
      Simultaneous renal replacement therapy (RRT) is routinely used to facilitate more rapid&#xD;
      metabolic or uremic control and more effective prevention and management of fluid overload&#xD;
      when ECMO is commenced in some ECMO centers registered in the Extracorporeal Life Support&#xD;
      Organization (ELSO). However, high-quality evidence to support the strategy of simultaneous&#xD;
      RRT during ECMO support is currently lacking. The investigators aim to perform a single&#xD;
      center, randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the impact of simultaneous RRT on outcomes&#xD;
      during ECMO support for CS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that simultaneous RRT with ECMO will improve survival, reduce&#xD;
      morbidity, and shorten duration on ECMO support, duration on invasive ventilation, total days&#xD;
      of ICU stay and hospitalization, and time to recovery from electrolyte disturbance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, single-center, randomized, open-label trial comparing simultaneous RRT and&#xD;
      standard care strategies in terms of overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CS patients who are likely to receive ECMO support will be enrolled and randomized with a 1:1&#xD;
      allocation to a simultaneous RRT arm vs. standard care arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Simultaneous RRT arm: The continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) machine is primed&#xD;
           and connected to the patient by a &quot;machine in-line&quot; CRRT access after randomization. The&#xD;
           drainage tube of the CRRT machine is connected to the ECMO circuit where is after the&#xD;
           membrane lung, and the return tube before the membrane lung. The simultaneous RRT begins&#xD;
           after ECMO is commenced and finishes when a patient has been weaned from ECMO. If a&#xD;
           patient has AKI (The definition is described in outcomes.) after ECMO weaning and&#xD;
           fulfills any of the criteria of the following conventional indications,&#xD;
           conventional-indication RRT should be delivered with independent CRRT access with a&#xD;
           central venous catheter: (1) Serum potassium≥6.0 mmol/L, (2) Serum bicarbonate≤10&#xD;
           mmol/L, or (3) urine output &lt; 0.5 ml/kg/h for 24 hours after ECMO weaning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Standard care arm: Only when a patient demonstrates AKI and fulfills any one of the&#xD;
           criteria of the conventional indication mentioned above during ECMO support or after&#xD;
           ECMO weaning, conventional-indication RRT should be delivered. The &quot;machine in-line&quot;&#xD;
           CRRT access or independent CRRT access is separately used when RRT is delivered during&#xD;
           ECMO support or after ECMO weaning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All-cause 30-day mortality after ECMO is commenced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morbidity (acute kidney injury, infection), duration on ECMO support, duration on invasive&#xD;
      ventilation, total days of ICU stay and hospitalization, and time to recovery from&#xD;
      electrolyte disturbance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects required:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline hospital mortality (66%) of CS patients with ECMO support was obtained from the&#xD;
      investigators' previous study. Based on their literature research, early initiation of RRT&#xD;
      could reduce the mortality by 18%. Assuming all-cause 30-day mortalities in the control and&#xD;
      intervention groups of 66% and 48%, respectively, with a two-sided significance of 0.05 and a&#xD;
      power of 0.8, a total of 262 patients (131 for each arm) will be required, including an&#xD;
      estimated dropout rate of 10%.&#xD;
