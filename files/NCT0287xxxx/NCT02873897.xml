  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In independent elderly people, the aim is to test recipes for different types of food from&#xD;
      different countries (starter, main course with culinary aids, carrot purees, desserts and&#xD;
      smoothies) likely to improve sensory acceptability of foods for elderly people who are&#xD;
      dependent for their meals (persons for whom at least one meal per day is provided by a&#xD;
      catering service - meals at home, old people's home). All of the recipes were developed&#xD;
      thanks to the first two parts of the OPTIFEL project so as to take into account the needs of&#xD;
      elderly people and recommendations in each country. The interest is to increase the sapidity/&#xD;
      attractiveness of meals by optimizing sensory properties and the nutritional content of the&#xD;
      foods, to meet the nutritional needs of this specific population with enriched recipes (with&#xD;
      leguminous proteins and/or vitamins and minerals and/or fibre) suitable for different&#xD;
      cultures. This ongoing research is being conducted on 2-4 different variants of each type of&#xD;
      product: the starter (a soup of legumes), the main dish (diced chicken with culinary aids)&#xD;
      and garnished (carrot puree), an apple-based dessert and fruit smoothies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each product family, two products will be selected for each country: the preferred&#xD;
      product (highest hedonic value of recipes enriched with leguminous proteins and/or vitamins&#xD;
      and minerals) and the standard product without enrichment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, at the end of this study, nine products will have been chosen: 2 soups, 2 culinary&#xD;
      aids, 2 carrot purees, 2 desserts and 1 smoothie&#xD;
