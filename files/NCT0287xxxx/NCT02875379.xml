      Background. Non invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIV) is among first line treatments&#xD;
      of acute respiratory failure. Several interfaces are available for non-invasive&#xD;
      ventilation.Despite full face and oronasal masks are more frequently used, some evidence&#xD;
      suggests that helmets may optimize patients' comfort and NIV tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During NIV, humidification strategies (heat and moisture exchangers HME or heated humidifiers&#xD;
      HH) may significantly affect patient's comfort and work of breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite physiological data suggested heated humidification as the best strategy during NIV&#xD;
      with full face masks, no differences were found in a randomized controlled study assessing&#xD;
      the effects of HME or HH on a pragmatic clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the higher dead space (i.e. 18 L/min) and rebreathing rate observed during helmet&#xD;
      NIV make such results not applicable to this particular setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators designed a randomized-crossover trial to assess the effect of four&#xD;
      humidification strategies during helmet NIV on patients with acute respiratory failure, in&#xD;
      terms of comfort, work of breathing and patient-ventilator interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. All awake, collaborative, hypoxemic patients requiring mechanical ventilation will&#xD;
      be considered for the enrollment. Hypercapnic patients (i.e.PaCO2&gt;45 mmHg) will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each enrolled patient will undergo helmet NIV with all the following humidification&#xD;
      strategies in a random order. Each period will last 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Passive humidification, double tube circuit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heated humification (MR 730, Fisher &amp; Paykel, Auckland, New Zealand), humidification&#xD;
           chamber temperature 33°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heated humification (MR 730, Fisher &amp; Paykel, Auckland, New Zealand), humidification&#xD;
           chamber temperature 37°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Passive humidification with HME, Y-piece circuit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ventilatory settings (Draeger Evita xl or Evita infinity ventilators):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pressure support ventilation; pressure support=20 cmH20; FiO2 titrated to obtain SpO2 between&#xD;
      92 and 98%; positive end-expiratory pressure=10 cmH2O; maximum inspiratory time 0.9 seconds;&#xD;
      inspiratory flow trigger = 2 l/min; expiratory trigger: 30% of the maximum inspiratory flow;&#xD;
      pressurization time=0,00 s.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such settings will be kept unchanged during the whole study period. An oesophageal catheter&#xD;
      will be placed and secured to measure oesophageal pressure (Pes) and gastric pressure (Pga)&#xD;
      (Nutrivent, Italy): the reliability of the measured pressure will be confirmed with an airway&#xD;
      occlusion test during NIV with oronasal mask. Work of breathing will be estimated with the&#xD;
      pressure-time product (PTP) of the pleural pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pneumotachograph (KleisTek) will record flow, airway pressure, Pes and Pga on a dedicated&#xD;
      laptop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of each cycle, the patient will be asked to rate his/her discomfort on a visual&#xD;
      analog scale (VAS) modified for ICU patients. The level of dyspnea will be assessed with the&#xD;
      Borg dyspnea scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters will be record at the end of each cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, SpO2, pH, PCO2, PaO2, SaO2. Airway and&#xD;
      esophageal pressure signals will be reviewed offline to detect patient-ventilator&#xD;
      asynchronies (ineffective efforts, double cycling, premature cycling, delayed cycling) and&#xD;
      asynchrony index (number of asynchrony events divided by the total respiratory rate computed&#xD;
      as the sum of the number of ventilator cycles (triggered or not) and of wasted efforts) will&#xD;
      be computed. The trigger delay will be also measured. The pressurization and depressurization&#xD;
      velocity will be assessed with the PTP airway index 300 and 500 (inspiratory and expiratory),&#xD;
      as suggested by Ferrone and coworkers. The work of breathing (WOB) for each breath will be&#xD;
      estimated by PTPes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An hygrometer (Dimar SRL, Italy) will measure and record on a dedicated laptop Helmet&#xD;
      temperature, relative and absolute humidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints: patient's comfort, work of breathing and asynchrony index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Sizing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the physiological design of the study, the investigators did not make an a priori&#xD;
      sample size and plan to enroll 24 patients.&#xD;

      Background Non invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIV) is among first line treatments of&#xD;
      acute respiratory failure. In patients with new-onset respiratory failure, NIV was showed to&#xD;
      reduce the rate of complications and the length of ICU stay, as compared to invasive&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation[1] Several interfaces are available for non-invasive ventilation: full&#xD;
      face masks, oronasal masks, nasal prongs and helmets[2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite full face and oronasal masks are more frequently used, some evidence suggests that&#xD;
      helmets may optimize patients' comfort and NIV tolerability. The helmet allows patients'&#xD;
      interaction, speech, feeding and does not limit cough. In addition, skin necrosis, gastric&#xD;
      distension, or eye irritation are seldom observed during helmet NIV, while may be&#xD;
      consequences of long-term treatments with face masks. [3] On the contrary, helmet NIV hampers&#xD;
      tidal volume monitoring, is contraindicated in hypercapnic patients and requires specific&#xD;
      ventilator settings[4]. Lastly, when compared to face masks, helmets may increase the work of&#xD;
      breathing and worsen patient-ventilator interaction[5][6][7].&#xD;
&#xD;
      During NIV, humidification strategies (heat and moisture exchangers HME or heated humidifiers&#xD;
      HH) may significantly affect patient's comfort and work of breathing [8][9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite physiological data suggested heated humidification as the best strategy during NIV&#xD;
      with full face masks[8][9], no differences were found in a randomized controlled study&#xD;
      assessing the effects of HME or HH on a pragmatic clinical outcome[10].&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the higher dead space (i.e. 18 L/min) and rebreathing rate observed during helmet&#xD;
      NIV make such results not applicable to this particular setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One only study assessed the effects of a HH during helmet low-flow continuous positive airway&#xD;
      pressure on comfort in healthy volunteers[11]. Indeed, patients suffering from acute&#xD;
      respiratory failure may behave differently, especially in terms of minute ventilation and&#xD;
      maximum inspiratory flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent bench study identified a better patient-ventilator interaction when helmet NIV was&#xD;
      provided through a double tube circuit, as compared to the Y-piece system [12]. The&#xD;
      investigators designed a randomized-crossover trial to assess the effect of four&#xD;
      humidification strategies during helmet NIV on patients with acute respiratory failure, in&#xD;
      terms of comfort, work of breathing and patient-ventilator interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Design: monocentric, randomized, cross-over trial. Each enrolled patient will undergo&#xD;
      helmet NIV with all the following humidification strategies in a random order. Each period&#xD;
      will last 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Passive humidification, double tube circuit.&#xD;

        -  Heated humification (MR 730, Fisher &amp; Paykel, Auckland, New Zealand), humidification&#xD;
           chamber temperature 37°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Passive humidification with HME, Y-piece circuit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ventilatory settings (Draeger Evita xl or Evita infinity ventilators):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pressure support ventilation; pressure support=20 cmH20[4]; FiO2 titrated to obtain SpO2&#xD;
      between 92 and 98%; positive end-expiratory pressure=10 cmH2O[4]; maximum inspiratory time&#xD;
      0.9 seconds; inspiratory flow trigger = 2 l/min; expiratory trigger: 30% of the maximum&#xD;
      inspiratory flow; pressurization time=0,00 s.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Qualitative data will be expressed as number of events (%) and&#xD;
      continuous data as mean ± standard deviation or median [Interquartile range]. Comparisons&#xD;
      concerning qualitative variables will be performed with the Mc-Namar test. Ordinal&#xD;
      qualitative variables or non normal quantitative variables will be compared with the&#xD;
      Friedman's Test, the wilcoxon sum of ranks test or the Mann-Whitney test, as appropriate. All&#xD;
      analysis will be performed applying a bilateral hypothesis. P ≤ 0.05 will be considered&#xD;
      significant. Statistical analysis will be performed with SPSS 20.0.&#xD;
