  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 Diabetes (TD2) is the leading cause of new cases of preventable blindness in these&#xD;
      countries (and the gold-standard treatment, laser photocoagulation has proven to be effective&#xD;
      in preventing vision loss at the end stage of eye disease due to proliferative diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy (PDR) that occurs in 3 to 6 % of the cases.Therefore, the ongoing search for&#xD;
      predictive factors of sight threatening stages of diabetic retinopathy has become more&#xD;
      important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies that have examined candidate predictive factors for diabetic eye disease&#xD;
      have mostly focused on systemic risk factors leading to PDR. Among various clinical&#xD;
      parameters, increased HbA1c % levels, uncontrolled blood pressure, diabetes duration,&#xD;
      neuropathy and elevated triglycerides have been associated with PDR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some genetic factors may also account for the development of PDR and are prospectively&#xD;
      considered in this study .&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In a previous study (2011), investigators demonstrated a statistically significant relation&#xD;
      between the Endothelial Lipase(EL) c.584C&gt;T polymorphism and the occurrence of diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy in 396 french patients with diabetes type 2 (DT2) with a longitudinal follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly (2014) in a subgroup of 287 DT2 patients, investigators showed the impact of the EL&#xD;
      rare T allele was consistent with a recessive mode of inheritance, with homozygotes for the&#xD;
      rare allele differing from the carriers of the major allele. Importantly, the homozygotes for&#xD;
      the rare T allele were more likely to present with advanced stages of diabetic retinopathy&#xD;
      (severe non proliferative and proliferative disease) and particularly with proliferative&#xD;
      diabetic retinopathy (PDR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this model investigators decided to conduct a case-control prospective study&#xD;
      comparing 155 french patients with DT2 with PDR (cases) and 155 french patients with DT2&#xD;
      without PDR (controls) on the basis of two genetic parameters: EL c.584C&gt;T polymorphism that&#xD;
      investigators previously studied and the C(-106)T aldose reductase polymorphism widely&#xD;
      studied in diabetic retinopathy.&#xD;
