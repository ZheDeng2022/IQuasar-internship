      Prospective single centre study aiming at validating a conditional imaging strategy for&#xD;
      diagnosis of suspected kidney stone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive Emergency department patients referred to the medical imaging department for&#xD;
      exploration of a suspected acute uncomplicated renal colic will undergo the following&#xD;
      interventions : systematic plain abdominal Xray, systematic ultrasonography and systematic&#xD;
      unenhanced CT (with a reduced dose scan), in addition to clinical examination and assessment&#xD;
      of body mass index and the Sex, Timing, Origin, Nausea, Erythrocytes (STONE) clinical&#xD;
      prediction score for symptomatic stone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up at 1 month to record the need for urologic intervention and its&#xD;
      type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The performances of different conditional imaging strategy for the diagnosis of suspected&#xD;
      renal colic will be assessed retrospectively. The conditional strategies tested will be based&#xD;
      on the patient's stone score and BMI and targeted use of combined plain X-ray and&#xD;
      ultrasonography and/or unenhanced CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reference diagnosis for renal colic will be made according to the finding of a ureteral&#xD;
      stone or indirect signs of urolithiasis at unenhanced CT.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plain abdominal Xray, Ultrasonography and unenhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis will be&#xD;
      performed at the time of admission to the imaging department, within 2 days from ED visit and&#xD;
      within a 1 hour delay from each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasonography will be interpretated in combination to plain abdominal Xray, and&#xD;
      independently from unenhanced CT, by two experienced radiologists blinded to the results of&#xD;
      each other.&#xD;
