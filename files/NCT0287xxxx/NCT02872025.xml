  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to investigate the change in the immune microenvironment of high risk&#xD;
      ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) after short term exposure to pembrolizumab.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will include 3 dose cohorts using a 3+3 cohort dose escalation design followed by&#xD;
      a 4th cohort (the dose expansion phase) at the maximum tolerated dose. Unless a dose limiting&#xD;
      toxicity (DLT), defined any grade 3 or 4 toxicity, is observed requiring expansion of a&#xD;
      cohort or a subject withdraws, 3 subjects will be enrolled into each cohort in the dose&#xD;
      escalation phase. Subjects, upon diagnosis with high risk DCIS, will be offered 2 doses of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab injected intralesionally (IL) 3 weeks apart (+/- 1 week) with surgery 3 weeks&#xD;
      (+/- 2 weeks) after the 2nd dose. The subject will then undergo the surgical treatment as&#xD;
      determined by the surgeon and the subject (partial mastectomy or mastectomy). The primary&#xD;
      objective of this phase of the study will be safety and feasibility of intralesional&#xD;
      injection of pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum tolerated dose will be used in the expansion phase. The expansion cohort will&#xD;
      have a target enrollment of 30 subjects enrolled to either the control group or the treatment&#xD;
      group. The treatment group will consist of 20 subjects who agree to receive the treatment.&#xD;
      The control group will consist of 10 eligible subjects who decline treatment and agree to&#xD;
      tissue collection and to the use of tissue for research purposes. The control group will&#xD;
      proceed to surgery alone within a 4 month timeframe following the diagnosis of high risk&#xD;
      DCIS. The treatment group will receive 4 doses of intralesional pembrolizumab monotherapy 3&#xD;
      weeks apart (+/- 1 week) prior to surgery (first 5 patients enrolled) but will now receive 2&#xD;
      doses of intralesional pembrolizumab and intralesional mRNA 2752 3 weeks apart (+/- 1 week)&#xD;
      prior to surgery. All subjects in the expansion cohort will also undergo a baseline MRI at&#xD;
      diagnosis and undergo a 2nd MRI prior to surgery. Baseline and pre-surgical MRI images will&#xD;
      be evaluated for changes in tumor volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: The last patient finished the escalation phase on 08/14/2018, and the study is&#xD;
      currently in the expansion phase.&#xD;

             reactive) or known active Hepatitis C virus (HCV) (defined as HCV RNA [qualitative] is&#xD;
             detected) infection. Note: no testing for Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C is required&#xD;
             unless mandated by local health authority.&#xD;
&#xD;

             Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection&#xD;
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza&#xD;
             vaccines (eg, FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.&#xD;
