      It is a prospective randomized- placebo control crossover study to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      long acting tolterodine (anticholinergic) in improving and treating nocturnal incontinence in&#xD;
      patient after radical cystectomy and orthotopic urinary diversion. patients will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated into two groups. one will receive the drug and the other will receive placebo.&#xD;
      continence status will be evaluated before and 4 weeks after treatment by the number of pads&#xD;
      used and the ICIQ-UI short form questionnaire. This is followed by two weeks of drug washout&#xD;
      then reevaluation of the continence status and each group will be crossed over and lastly&#xD;
      will be evaluated again.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radical cystectomy (RC) and urinary diversion remain the gold standard for treatment of&#xD;
      muscle invasive bladder cancer.1 The optimal goal is to control the malignancy, preserve&#xD;
      renal function and optimize health related quality of life. Decision of urinary diversion&#xD;
      selection has been changed in the last three decades from non-continent diversion to&#xD;
      orthotopic neobladder (ONB), to maintain voiding pattern closely similar to normal pattern&#xD;
      and to improve the overall health related quality of life (HRQOL).2 However, the continence&#xD;
      status after ONB is affected by many factors, such as patient's age, mental status, intact&#xD;
      and innervated external urethral sphincter, the reservoir capacity and pressure, presence of&#xD;
      infection and the completeness of voiding.3 The recovery of continence status takes from six&#xD;
      to 12 months after the operation to achieve day time continence which is regained earlier&#xD;
      than nocturnal continence which takes 12 to 24 months.3 The reported day time continence&#xD;
      ranges from 85 to 90% and NI in most series ranges from 20 to 40%.4- 7 in women, the reported&#xD;
      incidence of day time and NI ranged from 68 to 100% and 26 to 89%, respectively.8- 11&#xD;
      Nocturnal incontinence is a major problem that affect HRQOL . In a multicenter study,&#xD;
      individuals with ONB and NI have lower HRQOL, 12 this is similar to our data on female&#xD;
      patients with ONB.2 Nocturnal incontinence may be due to patient and pouch causes. Loss of&#xD;
      afferent input from the Detrusor muscle to the central nervous system is thought to account&#xD;
      for the worsening of nocturnal continence.13 In a study, done by El Bahnasawy et al, to&#xD;
      evaluate the factors affecting the NI after RC and ONB; higher pressure, positive urine&#xD;
      culture, large post voiding residual volume, decreased maximal urethral pressure, decreased&#xD;
      flow rate and patient compliance are associated with higher incidence of NI. However, on&#xD;
      multivariate analysis, only post voiding residual volumes, frequency, and maximal amplitude&#xD;
      of uninhibited contractions remained significantly associated with NI.14 Fifty percent of&#xD;
      women with NI after RC and ONB have had pouch hyperactivity on urodynamic evaluation.15 To&#xD;
      optimize nocturnal continence, patients are recommended to avoid sleeping pills and alcohol&#xD;
      in the evening, to void before going to sleep, and to set up an alarm to void at least once&#xD;
      during the night. Also proper treatment of infection is recommended.3 Up to 25% of patients&#xD;
      reported an improved nocturnal continence with the use of imipramine hydrochloride 25 mg at&#xD;
      bedtime. 14,16In a prospective randomized crossover study comparing 20 male enuretic patients&#xD;
      with ileal ONB receiving oxybutynin versus verapamil, both groups showed improved urodynamic&#xD;
      parameters and nocturnal continence status in 70% and 55% of patients, respectively.17&#xD;
      Ali-El-Dein et al, reported that treatment of female patients, who have NI after RC and ONB,&#xD;
      with anticholinergic drugs (tolterodine or oxybutynin chloride) has associated with&#xD;
      improvement and cure of NI in 36% and 23%, respectively.15 These data confirmed the efficacy&#xD;
      of the anticholinergic use in treatment of NI after RC and ONB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study, we will study the role of long acting anticholinergic (tolterodine 4&#xD;
      mg) at bedtime in management of NI after RC and ONB through a prospective randomized&#xD;
      placebo-controlled crossover study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients for whom RC and ONB and attend for routine follow up at the outpatient clinic of&#xD;
      Urology and Nephrology Center will be evaluated for eligibility of inclusion in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single center prospective randomized placebo-controlled crossover study. It will be held in&#xD;
      Urology and Nephrology Center, Mansoura University after approval of the local ethical&#xD;
      committee. Patients meet the inclusion criteria will be included in the study. All patients&#xD;
      will be evaluated by proper history, examination, BMI, ICIQ-UI Short Form, urine culture,&#xD;
      serum creatinine and abdominal and pelvic ultrasound. Patients with positive urine culture&#xD;
      will be treated by the appropriate antibiotic treatment till urine became sterile. Then,&#xD;
      patients will be randomly allocated in 2 groups (1:1) by computer generated random numbers.&#xD;
      The first group will receive long acting tolterodine (Incont LA, Adwia, Egypt) 4 mg at&#xD;
      bedtime. The second group will receive placebo at bedtime. Both groups will be maintained on&#xD;
      medication for 4 weeks. After that, both groups will be exposed to a period of two weeks of&#xD;
      washout then crossed over to the alternate therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed for nocturnal incontinence by the number of episodes per week,&#xD;
      number of pad used and ICIQ-UI short form questionnaire at the beginning of the study, after&#xD;
      4 weeks, after washout period then at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ICIQ-UI short form is developed for assessing the prevalence, severity, impact on quality&#xD;
      of life, and type of UI.19 The three scored items of the ICIQ-UI SF are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How often do you leak urine? (0 ''Never,'' 1 '' About once a week or less often,'' 2&#xD;
           ''Two or three times a week,'' 3 ''About once a day,'' 4 ''Several times a day,'' 5&#xD;
           ''All the time''),&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How much urine do you usually leak (whether you wear protection or not)? (0 ''None ,'' 2&#xD;
           ''A small amount,'' 4 ''A moderate amount,'' and 6 ''A large amount'')&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Overall, how much does leaking urine interfere with your everyday life? (Visual analogue&#xD;
           scale ranging from 0 ''Not at all'' to 10 ''A great deal''). Additional question is used&#xD;
           to determine when urine leakage occurs. The answers result in a sum, with minimum score&#xD;
           of 0, and maximum score of 21. Preliminary cut-off scores were set to 0 = ''no&#xD;
           incontinence'' and ˃1= ''urinary incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of tolterodine 4 mg on the&#xD;
      nocturnal incontinence. This will be done by comparing the effect of the drug in the same&#xD;
      group and by comparing its effect between different groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming type I statistical error of 5 % and type II statistical error of 20 %, we designed&#xD;
      our study to have a power of 80 %. Based on the results of the previous studies, the expected&#xD;
      difference between the study and control group is 59- 70 %.15, 17The dropped out number of&#xD;
      cases is suspected to be 10-20%. So, the sample size required to give significant difference&#xD;
      is 60 in each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ICIQ- UI score, number of pads and the number of nocturnal incontinence episodes will be&#xD;
      expressed as mean± SD. Independent sample T-test will be used for comparison of means. All&#xD;
      statistical tests will be done using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 16.0 for&#xD;
      Microsoft (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA) with a p value of less than 0.05 considered&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol is accepted by the local ethical committee of Faculty of medicine, Mansoura&#xD;
      University ( Mansoura Faculty of Medicine- Institutional Research Board MFM-IRB) and given&#xD;
      the number of R/16.07.51 Figure 1: study design and time schedule&#xD;
