    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of blinatumomab when given with&#xD;
      nivolumab alone or nivolumab and ipilimumab in treating patients with poor-risk CD19+&#xD;
      precursor B-lymphoblastic leukemia that has come back after a period of improvement&#xD;
      (relapsed) or has not responded to treatment (refractory). Immunotherapy with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as blinatumomab, nivolumab, and ipilimumab, may help the body's immune&#xD;
      system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and&#xD;
      spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the blinatumomab given in combination with&#xD;
      nivolumab alone, or in combination with both nivolumab and ipilimumab in subjects with&#xD;
      poor-risk, relapsed or refractory CD19+ pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or&#xD;
      CD19+ mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of blinatumomab plus&#xD;
      nivolumab, and blinatumomab plus both nivolumab and ipilimumab and to further confirm the&#xD;
      safety of the combination therapy in subjects with poor-risk, relapsed or refractory CD19+&#xD;
      pre-B cell ALL or CD19+ mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe and record anti-leukemia activity of blinatumomab and nivolumab, and&#xD;
      blinatumomab plus both nivolumab and ipilimumab, including the effects on minimal residual&#xD;
      disease (MRD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess preliminary anti-leukemia activity in expansion cohorts of patients with&#xD;
      poor-risk, relapsed or refractory CD19+ precursor B-lymphoblastic leukemia, or CD19+ mixed&#xD;
      phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To examine changes in absolute lymphocyte count and distribution of T cell subsets (CD4+,&#xD;
      CD8+, regulatory T cells [Tregs], effector T cells [Teffs]) and their differentiation status,&#xD;
      natural killer (NK) cells, and B cells before and post-blinatumomab, and immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitor(s) therapy in both peripheral blood and the bone marrow microenvironment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore changes in T cell co-signaling receptors expression in defined T cell&#xD;
      subpopulations and their canonic transcription factor expression in both peripheral blood and&#xD;
      bone marrow before and post-blinatumomab, and immune checkpoint inhibitor(s) therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To examine changes in expression of co-signaling molecules on leukemia blasts&#xD;
      (CD10+/CD19+/CD34+) before and after treatment with blinatumomab and checkpoint inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To examine the serum levels of cytokines before and after treatment with blinatumomab and&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitors, including the levels of sCTLA-4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To perform immune profiling of T cell repertoire and characterize T cell transcriptional&#xD;
      signature before and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of blinatumomab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive blinatumomab intravenously (IV) continuously on days 1-28. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 42 days for up to 5 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Patients also receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 11 and then every 2 weeks&#xD;
      for up to year. Some patients also receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 11 and then&#xD;
      every 6 weeks for up to 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;

             stopped at least 24 hours prior to the initiation of blinatumomab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should be excluded if they have had prior treatment with an anti-PD-1,&#xD;
             anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CTLA-4 antibody, or any other antibody or drug&#xD;
             specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or immune checkpoint pathways&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active central nervous system leukemia are excluded from this clinical&#xD;
             trial because they may develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound&#xD;
             the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events; patients with a history of&#xD;
             central nervous system (CNS) leukemia but no active disease at the time of enrollment&#xD;
             are eligible; the absence of CNS disease must be confirmed by flow cytometric and&#xD;
             cytologic examination of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within 7 days of study&#xD;
             enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active leukemia in the testes or isolated extramedullary relapse; patients with a&#xD;
             history of treated leukemia in testes but no active disease at the time of enrollment&#xD;
             are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to nivolumab, ipilimumab, or blinatumomab&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, active, uncontrolled&#xD;
             infection; symptomatic congestive heart failure; unstable angina pectoris; cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia; or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements; patients with infection under treatment and controlled with&#xD;
             antibiotics are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because nivolumab and ipilimumab have the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with nivolumab and ipilimumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with nivolumab and ipilimumab; these potential risks may also apply&#xD;
             to blinatumomab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of any chronic hepatitis including alcoholic, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis&#xD;
             (NASH), drug related, autoimmune, chronic viral positive tests for hepatitis B virus&#xD;
             surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) in the absence of&#xD;
             hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs), or a positive hepatitis C (HCV) viral load;&#xD;
             these patients are excluded due to the risk for autoimmune hepatitis with immune&#xD;
             checkpoint inhibitors exacerbating their known liver disease as well as the unknown&#xD;
             risk for hepatitis B and/or C reactivation with blinatumomab and immune checkpoint&#xD;
             inhibitors&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with active autoimmune disease, a history of known or suspected autoimmune&#xD;
             disease or a history of a syndrome requiring systemic corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily&#xD;
             of prednisone equivalent) except for the treatment of malignancy with the exception&#xD;
             of:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Isolated vitiligo&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Resolved childhood atopy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) titer without associated&#xD;
                  symptoms or history of symptoms of an autoimmune disorder&#xD;
&#xD;

               -  Psoriasis, Sjogren's syndrome, and arthropathies not requiring systemic treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Autoimmune diseases: these include but are not limited to patients with a history&#xD;
                  of immune related neurologic disease, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune&#xD;
                  (demyelinating) neuropathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome, myasthenia gravis; systemic&#xD;
                  autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), connective tissue&#xD;
                  diseases, scleroderma, autoimmune vasculitis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),&#xD;
                  Crohn's, ulcerative colitis, hepatitis; and patients with a history of toxic&#xD;
                  epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or phospholipid syndrome&#xD;
                  should be excluded because of the risk of recurrence or exacerbation of disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with&#xD;
             either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other&#xD;
             immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration; inhaled or&#xD;
             topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses =&lt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents&#xD;
             are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease; patients are permitted to&#xD;
             use topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalational corticosteroids&#xD;
             (with minimal systemic absorption); physiologic replacement doses of systemic&#xD;
             corticosteroids are permitted, even if &gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents; a brief&#xD;
             course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g., contrast dye allergy) or for&#xD;
             treatment of non-autoimmune conditions (e.g., delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction&#xD;
             caused by contact allergen), or as pre-phase treatment for cytoreduction; patients&#xD;
             will receive steroids with blinatumomab to reduce cytokine release syndrome (CRS) as&#xD;
             specified in the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had evidence of active or acute diverticulitis, intra-abdominal&#xD;
             abscess, gastrointestinal (GI) obstruction and abdominal carcinomatosis which are&#xD;
             known risk factors for bowel perforation should be evaluated for the potential need&#xD;
             for additional treatment before coming on study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have a history of clinically relevant CNS pathology such as epilepsy,&#xD;
             seizure, paresis, aphasia, stroke, severe brain injuries, dementia, Parkinson's&#xD;
             disease, cerebellar disease, psychosis, or other significant CNS abnormalities; a&#xD;
             history of treated CNS leukemia will be allowed if recent CNS studies confirm the&#xD;
             absence of active CNS disease at the time of study entry (screening)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a known concurrent malignancy that is progressing or requires active&#xD;
             treatment; exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell&#xD;
