    <textblock>
      This Phase 1/2 open-label study will combine methods for conducting MDMA-assisted therapy&#xD;
      with methods from the CBCT for PTSD in order to treat 10 participants with chronic PTSD and&#xD;
      their partners (intimate or non-intimate significant other who does not have a current&#xD;
      diagnosis of PTSD) in order to explore whether combined treatment is effective. Each therapy&#xD;
      team will have one therapist trained and experienced in MDMA assisted psychotherapy and one&#xD;
      therapist trained and experienced in CBCT. During the first experimental session, both&#xD;
      participants will receive 75 mg of MDMA followed 1.5 to 2 hours later by an optional&#xD;
      supplemental half-dose of 37.5 mg. During the second experimental session, an initial dose of&#xD;
      either 100 or 75 mg of MDMA will be administered to both participants followed by an optional&#xD;
      supplemental half-dose of either 50 mg or 37.5 mg. The primary objective of this study is to&#xD;
      assess changes in PTSD symptoms from Baseline to Primary Endpoint in CAPS-5 total severity&#xD;
      scores in PTSD participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PTSD is a stress-related psychiatric condition that may occur following a traumatic event&#xD;
      such as war, disaster, sexual abuse, violence, terrorism, and accidents. PTSD negatively&#xD;
      impacts a person's daily life, resulting in relationship difficulties, difficulty in finding&#xD;
      and maintaining a job, reduced cognitive and psychosocial functioning, substance abuse,&#xD;
      high-cost healthcare use, and increased depression and suicide risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine is a drug that releases serotonin, norepinephrine and&#xD;
      dopamine in the brain and indirectly increases levels of the neurohormones oxytocin, arginine&#xD;
      vasopressin and cortisol. In the context of psychotherapy, MDMA has been noted to reduce&#xD;
      defenses and fear of emotional injury while enhancing communication and capacity for&#xD;
      introspection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive-Behavioral Conjoint Therapy (CBCT) for PTSD is a three-phase, 15-session,&#xD;
      manualized treatment. This Phase 1/2 open-label study will combine methods for conducting&#xD;
      MDMA-assisted therapy with methods from the CBCT for PTSD in order to treat 10 participants&#xD;
      with chronic PTSD and their partners (intimate or non-intimate significant other who does not&#xD;
      have a current diagnosis of PTSD) in order to explore whether combined treatment is&#xD;
      effective. Each therapy team will have one therapist trained and experienced in MDMA assisted&#xD;
      therapy and one therapist trained and experienced in CBCT. During the first experimental&#xD;
      session, both participants will receive 75 mg of MDMA followed 1.5 to 2 hours later by an&#xD;
      optional supplemental half-dose of 37.5 mg. During the second experimental session, an&#xD;
      initial dose of either 100 or 75 mg of MDMA will be administered to both participants&#xD;
      followed by an optional supplemental half-dose of either 50 mg or 37.5 mg. The primary&#xD;
      objective of this study is to assess changes in PTSD symptoms from Baseline to Primary&#xD;
      Endpoint in Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) total severity scores in&#xD;
      PTSD participants.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline (screening)</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) is a clinician administered and scored assessment of PTSD symptoms via structured interview based upon PTSD diagnosis in DSM-5. It contains symptom subscales, a CAPS-5 total severity score, and a diagnostic score. The total severity score is a sum of symptom frequency and intensity scores for the subscales B (re-experiencing), C (avoidance) and D (hypervigilance) and ranges from 0 to 136, with higher scores indicating greater severity of PTSD symptoms.</description>

        <title>Baseline Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) Total Severity Score</title>
        <description>The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) is a clinician administered and scored assessment of PTSD symptoms via structured interview based upon PTSD diagnosis in DSM-5. It contains symptom subscales, a CAPS-5 total severity score, and a diagnostic score. The total severity score is a sum of symptom frequency and intensity scores for the subscales B (re-experiencing), C (avoidance) and D (hypervigilance) and ranges from 0 to 136, with higher scores indicating greater severity of PTSD symptoms.</description>

        <title>Baseline Trauma and Attachment Beliefs Scale (TABS)</title>
        <description>TABS is a 84-item self-report scale, which measures responses on a 1 to 6 scale (1 = &quot;Disagree Strongly, 6 = Agree Strongly) the degree to which respondents believe the statements correspond with their own beliefs. The measures of these beliefs relate to self-safety, other-safety, self-trust, other-trust, self-esteem, other-esteem, self-intimacy, other-intimacy, self-control, and other control. A TABS total score is calculated by summing all of the items (range 84 to 504). Higher scores indicate greater disruption.</description>
