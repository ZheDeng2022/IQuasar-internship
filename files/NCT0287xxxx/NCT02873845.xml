  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Altered quality of life in patients with stage III or IV colon cancer is well known. At their&#xD;
      sides, their spouse/partner must also cope with the suffering caused by the disease and the&#xD;
      upheavals that it engenders, with the treatments, in the organization of their everyday life.&#xD;
      The physical, emotional, social and financial impact of cancer in general and its treatment&#xD;
      on care-givers has already been studied. However, there are no data concerning the &quot;objective&#xD;
      burden&quot;, that is to say the nature and the magnitude of the care weighing on the spouse of&#xD;
      persons with colon cancer. Objective is to develop and validate a questionnaire that can be&#xD;
      completed by the spouse/partner of patients with stage III or IV colon cancer so as to&#xD;
      evaluate the burden of the disease in everyday life. It will allow medico-social&#xD;
      professionals to identify spouses/partners in difficulty and the needs of patients so as to&#xD;
      offer the best support.&#xD;
