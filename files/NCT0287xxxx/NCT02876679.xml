  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a two arm randomized Phase II, multicenter trial comparing&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide to anti-thymocyte globulin for Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD) prophylaxis&#xD;
      in patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing reduced intensity conditioning&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is a well-established therapy for different&#xD;
      hematologic malignancies. Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens can decrease the rate&#xD;
      of toxicity/mortality in elderly patients, or in patients with poor medical condition. GVHD&#xD;
      prophylaxis remains a challenging task after allo-SCT. The Flu-ivBu combination is a widely&#xD;
      used RIC regimen, endorsed by EMA since July 2014. ATG in combination with cyclosporine-A&#xD;
      ±mycophenolate mofetil is the backbone for GVHD prophylaxis in this setting. ATG can prevent&#xD;
      GVHD with a good efficacy, but at the cost of a higher toxicity and profound&#xD;
      immunosuppression, calling for more effective therapies. The most widely used RIC regimen in&#xD;
      France incorporates fludarabine (Flu), intermediate doses of IV-busulfan (Bu) and&#xD;
      anti-thymocyte globulins (ATG). While the use of ATG can prevent severe acute and chronic&#xD;
      GVHD after allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation from both&#xD;
      HLA-identical sibling and unrelated donors, some data suggested that in-vivo T-cell depletion&#xD;
      with ATG in the RIC setting may induce a higher risk of disease relapse. Also, ATG induces&#xD;
      profound immune suppression and increase incidence of opportunistic infections, especially&#xD;
      EBV-related complications (relative risk=4.9; 95% CI[ 1.1-21.0]; P=0.03).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, high-dose post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) was developed to&#xD;
      facilitate HLA-haploidentical allo-SCT using unmanipulated bone marrow (BM) cells. PTCy was&#xD;
      effective in preventing both acute and chronic GVHD given its capacity to preferentially&#xD;
      eliminate allo-reactive T cells and preserve regulatory T cells, both of which impact&#xD;
      allogeneic immune reactions. Subsequently, the efficacy of PTCy as sole GVHD prophylaxis&#xD;
      after myeloablative conditioning when using BM was also shown. However, BM is not the&#xD;
      preferred source of stem cells after RIC allo-SCT, and the potential efficacy of PTCy on&#xD;
      preventing GVHD when using PBSCs (which is the most frequently used source of allogeneic&#xD;
      cells worldwide) is debated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advent of PTCy therapy is nowadays on the cutting edge. Thus, the potential efficacy (and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness) of PTCy for GVHD prophylaxis may have a major ATG sparing potential. A&#xD;
      recent single centre phase 2 study (n=49) suggested that PTCy alone may not be the preferred&#xD;
      GVHD prophylaxis following a RIC transplant with PBSCs. Indeed, A matched cohort analysis&#xD;
      compared outcomes to tacrolimus/methotrexate GVHD prophylaxis and indicated higher rates of&#xD;
      acute GVHD grade II to IV (46% versus 19%; hazard ratio [HR], 2.8; P =0.02) and&#xD;
      treatment-related mortality (HR, 3.3; P =0.035) and worse overall survival (HR, 1.9; P=0..04)&#xD;
      with post-CY. Interpretation of the above non-randomized data is further complicated by&#xD;
      heterogeneity (related and unrelated donors, BM and PBSC as stem cell source, different&#xD;
      conditioning regimen), highlighting the need for a controlled randomized trial in a&#xD;
      standardized setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultimate goal of this Phase IIB study is to assess the feasibility and inform the design&#xD;
      of a subsequent phase III study. The present randomized trial is designed to compare the&#xD;
      efficacy of the addition of PTCy to current standard of care with ATG after a Flu-Bu-based&#xD;
      RIC regimen on GVHD prophylaxis. The protocol will use a novel endpoint for benchmarking&#xD;
      interventions based on a composite primary endpoint of GVHD-free, relapse-free survival which&#xD;
      measures freedom from ongoing morbidity and represents an ideal outcome measure after&#xD;
      allo-SCT.&#xD;
