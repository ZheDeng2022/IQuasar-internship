      Randomized trial comparing internet-delivered ACT with therapist support against waiting list&#xD;
      for persons with hearing loss and comorbid psychological distress&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hearing loss is the most common sensory disability in the world. Hearing loss is an auditory&#xD;
      disability which affects not only speech recognition, but also the ability to recognize,&#xD;
      locate and identify sounds in one's environment. Today there are a variety of studies&#xD;
      investigating the relationship between hearing loss and mental health. For example, there are&#xD;
      studies showing that hearing loss can lead to depression, somatization, social isolation,&#xD;
      worrying or anxiety, loneliness, smaller social networks, lower self-efficacy, sensitivity to&#xD;
      stress, burnout, and impaired sleep quality and quality of life in comparison with people&#xD;
      with normal hearing. Initial results from other studies indicate that acceptance may be of&#xD;
      importance, as it in turn can lead to increased help-seeking.To avoid prolonged stress and a&#xD;
      healthy self-efficacy could contribute to greater well-being of people with hearing loss.&#xD;
      This is the first study to use ACT to improve psychological health in people with hearing&#xD;
      loss through the process of psychological flexibility. The treatment is eight weeks long and&#xD;
      internet delivered through self-help texts with weekly therapist support.&#xD;
