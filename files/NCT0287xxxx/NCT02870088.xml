      The purpose of this project is to investigate the effect of breaking prolonged sitting on&#xD;
      acute adipose tissue and metabolic responses.&#xD;

      Pre-trial assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity assessment : a combined heart rate/accelerometer monitor was worn for 7&#xD;
      days to assess participant's habitual physical activity energy expenditure (Actiheart,&#xD;
      Cambridge Neurotechnology Ltd., Cambridge, UK). This was attached to the left chest via 2&#xD;
      adhesive ECG pads for 24 hours per day except for during showering/bathing/swimming.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body composition analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body mass was assessed using digital scales post-void (TANITA corp., Tokyo, Japan). Waist and&#xD;
      hip circumference was assessed based on World Health Organisation guidelines. Body&#xD;
      composition was determined by using Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (Discovery, Hologic,&#xD;
      Bedford, UK). Abdominal subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue mass was estimated from a&#xD;
      central region between L1-L4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial days:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the 72 h prior to each main trial, participants were asked to refrain from performing any&#xD;
      strenuous physical activity. In the 48 h prior to each main trial, consuming alcohol/caffeine&#xD;
      was not allowed and in the meantime, a dietary record was completed 48 h before the first&#xD;
      main trial. Participants were asked to replicate this diet prior to their second main trial.&#xD;
      In addition, in the 48 h prior to each main trial, participants were asked to restrict their&#xD;
      steps to under 4000 steps per day in order to mimic sedentary lifestyle patterns and&#xD;
      eliminate any acute effects from recent physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two trials were performed including one prolonged sitting and one breaking prolonged sitting&#xD;
      trials. In the breaking trial, after consuming 1st meal, participants walked 2 min on a&#xD;
      treadmill at 6.4 km/h speed every 20 minutes for the following 180 min. For the remainder of&#xD;
      the time participants sat on the chair. After 180 min, the 2nd meal was provided. After&#xD;
      finishing the 2nd meal, participants were continue 2 min of breaking prolonged sitting&#xD;
      physical activity at the same speed every 20 min for the following 120 min. In total,&#xD;
      participants performed 15 two minute bouts of physical activity throughout the trial for a&#xD;
      total of 30 min breaking prolonged sitting physical activity. In the prolonged sitting trial,&#xD;
      participants sat on a chair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expired air, RPE and heart rate were collected in two of breaking sitting walks to determine&#xD;
      exercise intensity and energy expenditure. In addition, two 5 min sitting of expired air and&#xD;
      heart rate were taken to calculated total energy expenditure during sitting. During each&#xD;
      trial, participants were allowed to move from a sitting position to the treadmill or to void&#xD;
      if required. While sitting, participants were only allowed to read, use a laptop or watch&#xD;
      television but were otherwise asked to keep as still as possible throughout. In the first&#xD;
      trial, participants were allowed to consume water ad libitum and the volume ingested was&#xD;
      replicated for the 2nd trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each main trial, baseline blood samples was collected before the 1st meal and hourly for&#xD;
      the following 5 hours. Additional blood samples were collected every 15 min after the first&#xD;
      and second meal. A total of 14 blood samples were collected for each trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adipose tissue culture and gene expression:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After adipose tissue biopsy and cleaning, tissue was minced to approximately 5-10 mg and&#xD;
      directly placed in sterile culture plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) with endothelial cell&#xD;
      basal media (ECBM) containing 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin 100 U ml-1 penicillin&#xD;
      and 0.1 mg ml-1 streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, UK). Adipose tissue was incubated&#xD;
      with a final ratio of 100mg tissue per 1 ml ECBM media for 3 hours. A 37°C, 5% CO2 and 95 ±&#xD;
      5% relative humidity incubator was used (MCO-18A1C CO2 incubator; Sanyo, Osaka, Japan). Media&#xD;
      was transferred to sterile eppendorfs and stored at -80°C after 3 hours incubation.&#xD;
      Approximately 200 mg adipose tissue was homogenised in 5ml Trizol in an RNase/DNase-free&#xD;
      sterile tube (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) and stored at -80°C before further analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A previous similar study reported incremental area under curve (iAUC) for insulin during&#xD;
      breaking prolonged sitting compared to prolonged sitting of 3337 IU L-1 9h-1 and 2470 IU L-1&#xD;
      9h-1, respectively. Based on an assumed SD of 600 IU L-1 9h-1, we would require 9&#xD;
      participants to show a difference in iAUC for insulin with 95% power and 5% alpha.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data was presented as mean ± standard error of mean (SEM). Incremental area under curve&#xD;
      (iAUC) was calculated using the trapezoid method and differences between trials analysed&#xD;
      using paired t-tests. Glucose, insulin, NEFA, adipokines, and cell culture outcomes were&#xD;
      determined using a two-way ANOVA with repeated measures using SPSS version 22 (IBM, Armonk,&#xD;
      NY, USA). Where significant interactions (trial × time) were found, a post hoc analysis was&#xD;
      applied using t-test with the Holm-Bonferroni correction. Single comparisons used a t-test or&#xD;
      non-parametric equivalent. Statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05.&#xD;
