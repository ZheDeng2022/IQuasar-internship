  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to examine a moderate hypofractionation regimen of proton beam therapy for high&#xD;
      risk or unfavorable intermediate risk prostate cancer. The prostate and seminal vesicles are&#xD;
      treated with 6750 centigray (RBE) in 25 fractions (i.e. 270 centigray/fraction), while the&#xD;
      regional pelvic nodes receive 4500 centigray (RBE) in 25 fractions (i.e. 180&#xD;
      centigray/fraction) simultaneously. The overall treatment time is 5 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Proton beam therapy can provide a therapeutic gain by offering at least equivalent (or&#xD;
      superior) tumor control while reducing the risk of radiation toxicity, in comparison with&#xD;
      conventional photon-based external beam radiotherapy, given its dose-deposition&#xD;
      characteristics. Currently the clinical target volume of proton beam for the treatment of&#xD;
      prostate cancer has been mostly limited to the prostate and the seminal vesicles. There has&#xD;
      been no study of proton beam therapy to treat both the primary tumor in the prostate and the&#xD;
      regional pelvic nodes simultaneously using a moderate hypofractionation regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a prospective, single-arm, clinical trial to evaluate a moderate&#xD;
      hypofractionation regimen of proton beam therapy for high risk or unfavorable intermediate&#xD;
      risk prostate cancer. The clinical target volumes of proton beam therapy include both the&#xD;
      prostate/seminal vesicles and the regional pelvic nodes. The primary objective is to assess&#xD;
      late grade ≥ 3 gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity. The secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to evaluate late grade ≥ 2 GI and GU toxicity, acute grade ≥ 3 GI and GU&#xD;
      toxicity, and disease-free survival including freedom from PSA (prostate specific antigen)&#xD;
      relapse at 5 years. The study provides an avenue to examine the safety, efficacy, cost&#xD;
      effectiveness, and convenience of a moderate hypofractionation regimen (5-week course) of&#xD;
      proton beam therapy.&#xD;
