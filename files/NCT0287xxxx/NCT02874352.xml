    <textblock>
      This study will inform the feasibility of the High Resolution Impedance Manometry (HRIM)&#xD;
      system combined with Automated Impedance Manometry (AIM) analysis as a screening tool for&#xD;
      dysphagia and aspiration for the intensive care population with tracheostomy. This pilot&#xD;
      study aims to determine the incidence of dysphagia and aspiration risk in intensive care&#xD;
      patients with tracheostomy and the investigators hypothesise that the incidence of dysphagia&#xD;
      in intensive care patients with tracheostomy will be higher than in an age matched&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aspiration pneumonia is a common mechanism for recurrent mechanical ventilation episodes in&#xD;
      intensive care patients and leads to longer hospital admissions, increased morbidity, and&#xD;
      mortality. When length of the mechanical ventilation is prolonged the translaryngeal tube is&#xD;
      changed to a tracheostomy tube. This practice has several advantages: further pressure damage&#xD;
      to the vocal cords is avoided, weaning from the respirator is facilitated, and oral feeding&#xD;
      is made possible. Swallowing difficulty, which in many cases depends on pharyngeal and upper&#xD;
      esophageal dysfunction, is shown to be linked to aspiration pneumonia. Furthermore, previous&#xD;
      studies indicate that swallowing dysfunction is a frequent problem in intensive care patients&#xD;
      with tracheostomy although the reported incidence varies markedly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Swallowing function in intensive care patients with tracheostomy is not routinely evaluated&#xD;
      because the current diagnostic techniques, speech pathology bedside assessment (BSA),&#xD;
      fibreoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES), and Videofluoroscopy (VF), are&#xD;
      laborious, subjective expertise-dependent methods. Instead symptoms reported by the patient&#xD;
      during fluid and food intake (cough, chest pain) are allowed to guide further feeding&#xD;
      although it is known that silent aspiration is a common cause for aspiration pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To prevent leakage of pharyngeal contents into the trachea most of the tracheostomy tubes are&#xD;
      provided with an air-filled cuff. This cuff, when inflated, exerts pressure against the inner&#xD;
      tracheal wall and thereby seals trachea around the tracheostomy tube. As security this cuff&#xD;
      is often inflated during intake of fluids and food although there are studies that indicate&#xD;
      this may deteriorate swallowing function and in fact increase risk for aspiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Automated Impedance Manometry (AIM) analysis is a method that combines measurements of&#xD;
      manometry (pressure) and impedance (flow) using specialized equipment to generate objective&#xD;
      numerical values indicative of the different physiological processes governing safe&#xD;
      pharyngeal swallowing. During a swallow, these measures quantify timing of bolus flow&#xD;
      relative to pharyngeal propulsion, any mechanical resistance to flow during propulsion, and&#xD;
      the overall pharyngeal contractility. Pressure-flow measures are then combined to derive a&#xD;
      swallow risk index (SRI) that provides a global assessment of swallowing and defines a level&#xD;
      of swallowing dysfunction that may predispose to risk of aspiration. This objective&#xD;
      assessment of swallowing function has potential to provide timely and more targeted treatment&#xD;
      options. It is easily conducted at the bedside with minimal disruption of ongoing medical&#xD;
      treatment, and carries with it only negligible risk to the patient. Measures are derived by&#xD;
      using a high resolution impedance manometry (HRIM) system (Sierra Scientific Instruments,&#xD;
      Inc., Los Angeles, California, USA). The system employs a solid state catheter with 4.2 mm&#xD;
      outer diameter incorporating 36 circumferential 1 cm-spaced pressure sensors and 18 2-cm long&#xD;
      impedance segments is placed transnasally with sensors straddling the entire pharyngo- and&#xD;
      esophageal segment. Data recordings are done during several bolus swallows and analysed&#xD;
      afterwards using AIM analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty intensive care patients and ten healthy volunteers are included in the study. After&#xD;
      researchers have described the study, participants will be consented, and asked to complete a&#xD;
      brief questionnaire about their swallow function. During the study, participants will be&#xD;
      sitting comfortably in their bed. The manometry catheter will be passed through one nostril&#xD;
      and down into the esophagus, stopping just at the top of the stomach. Once satisfactorily&#xD;
      placed, the participant will be asked to swallow 4 x 5 ml; 4 x 10 ml, 3 x 20 ml of slightly&#xD;
      salty water and 4 x 10 ml semisolid jelly. If first inflated the tracheostomy cuff is now&#xD;
      deflated and the procedure repeated. Furthermore, part of the patients are evaluated by FEES&#xD;
      simultaneously to HRIM measurements. Once the study is completed, the tube is removed.&#xD;
      Patients are followed upp two months after ICU discharge with questionnaire of swallowing&#xD;
      function and also asked to perform an additional HRIM measurement. Volunteers will perform a&#xD;
      similar swallow series as the patients on one study occasion.&#xD;
