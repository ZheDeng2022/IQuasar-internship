  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Muscular dystrophy oculopharyngeal ( OPMD ) is an autosomal dominant inherited myopathy&#xD;
      manifested as selective involvement of the levator muscles of the upper eyelids , head of&#xD;
      ptosis, and muscles of the intersection pharyngolaryngeal originally disorders swallowing.&#xD;
      Ptosis can be treated with surgery ( shortening of the levator muscle ), but the disease&#xD;
      continues to evolve , relapses occur , necessitating another intervention , which is the&#xD;
      suspension of the eyelid to the frontal muscle that can cause corneal complications by&#xD;
      imperfect lid closure .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective is to restore muscle function levator muscle of the upper eyelid by providing&#xD;
      a registry of autologous myoblasts from a non- clinically affected muscle .&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study on the same model was conducted in patients in ENT OPMD crossroads of muscles with&#xD;
      encouraging results , 12/12 patients had improved quality of life and no degradation of&#xD;
      swallowing was observed in 10 / 12 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an interventional study , multicenter, comparative , one eye receiving the cells and&#xD;
      the contralateral eye as a negative control . If effectiveness following review of the&#xD;
      primary endpoint and the advice of an independent expert committee , the experimental&#xD;
      treatment will be offered to the patient to the contralateral eyelid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seven centers are associated with this project as inclusion and assessment center. Patients&#xD;
      are referred by different clinical sites in Caen ophthalmology department which will be&#xD;
      performed pre-transplant assessment, the collection of donor myoblast muscle graft and part&#xD;
      tracking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected duration is 3 years (2 years of inclusion and evaluation of the primary endpoint&#xD;
      at 1 year) for inclusion of 10 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of autologous myoblast transplantation has been shown in several directions with&#xD;
      promising efficacy results. They will be produced by the unit of Biotherapy Rouen University&#xD;
      Hospital (Prof. O. Boyer), who currently leads a test with these cells (ClinicalTrials.gov,&#xD;
      myoblast for Anal Incontinence (MIAS), NCT01523522, 24 patients were provided in Protocol was&#xD;
      included in July 2014, at 6 months follow up of the last patient is expected in January 2015)&#xD;
      and authorized the production of advanced therapy medicinal products prepared punctually&#xD;
      (ANSM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, different successive steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Step of including: patient aged 18 to 75, verification of the diagnosis of the disease,&#xD;
           evaluation balance ptosis (measurements, photographs, films), obtaining consent,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Muscle biopsy of a healthy muscle to cell amplification, an outpatient basis, under&#xD;
           local anesthesia, 3 to 4 weeks before transplantation,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transplant myoblasts by multiple intramuscular injections (6), under local anesthesia.&#xD;
           Longitudinal microscarifications be made superficially injected into muscles to&#xD;
           stimulate muscle regeneration. Intramuscular injection of myoblasts will be in the&#xD;
           levator muscle of the upper lid 6 in equidistant points, each injection containing 5&#xD;
           million cells. These injections will be made in muscle mass over an area of about 5 cm2,&#xD;
           ranging between 6 and 20 mm above the tarsus to be in the thick muscle area. It is&#xD;
           intended to be injected into the eye to treat randomized a total of 30 million&#xD;
           myoblasts. This protocol is based on the one used for correction of ENT disorders within&#xD;
           several PHRC under the responsibility of Professor Sophie Périé. The doses used for the&#xD;
           myoblast transplantation in the pharyngeal constrictor muscles were adapted to the&#xD;
           levator muscle of the eyelid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up visits for 3 years for each patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The first year, to evaluation of the primary endpoint visit to 8 days to a month,&#xD;
                then every 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Out protocol and up to 3 years after administration of the cells every 6 months&#xD;
                (this monitoring will be carried out as part of standard care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These visits evaluate the effectiveness of the transplant on different objective measurements&#xD;
      on both eyes (eyelid opening slot in the gaze straight ahead; levator muscle strength of the&#xD;
      upper eyelid, visual benefit: measurement of visual acuity measurement visual field), and the&#xD;
      profit on neck pain. The tours include a side effect detection examination (local&#xD;
      inflammatory phenomena, palpable lumps).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the end, this landmark trial for the new F.H.U. SURFACE dealing with regenerative medicine&#xD;
      in the head and neck, the investigators expect an improvement in the quality of the levator&#xD;
      of the upper eyelid muscles deficient with a correction of ptosis in patients.&#xD;
