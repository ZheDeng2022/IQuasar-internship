      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification and measurement of uterine contractions throughout pregnancy and labor is&#xD;
      crucial to the well being of both mother and fetus. Prematurity is one of the major causes&#xD;
      for adverse pregnancy outcomes, and clinical decision-making often relies on uterine&#xD;
      frequency as recorded by a tocodynamometer, as well as on other methods including sonographic&#xD;
      cervical length, pelvic examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To show that the use of the EUM in preterm labor is effective in establishing true preterm&#xD;
      labor.&#xD;

      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, three methods of assessing uterine activity exist. The first, tocodynamometry, is&#xD;
      based on mechanical measurement of abdominal wall stiffness by a strain gauge placed&#xD;
      externally on the patient's abdomen. This method mainly displays the presence of a&#xD;
      contraction, its duration and the frequency of contractions. Yet, it fails to reflect the&#xD;
      actual quantity of baseline tone or contraction amplitude due to great variability in&#xD;
      placement and the gravida's body habitus. It is also unable to distinguish between true&#xD;
      contractions or maternal movements or maternal Valsalva maneuver such as in coughing,&#xD;
      straining or sneezing. These are the main reasons this technology is known to be unreliable&#xD;
      in many cases and shows high percentage of false positive and false negative results [1].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another method for monitoring uterine contractions is an internal measurement of uterine&#xD;
      pressure via an Intra-Uterine Pressure Catheter (IUPC). While it is accurate in recording&#xD;
      intensity, duration and frequency of contractions, as well as uterine basal tone, it has two&#xD;
      principle limitations: the IUPC can only be used after rupture of the membranes, and the&#xD;
      introduction of a foreign object in the uterine cavity may result in chorioamnionitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third method of evaluating uterine activity involves recording of the myometrial&#xD;
      electrical activity [2]. Initially, this was assessed in animal models by means of invasive&#xD;
      uterine EMG [3-6], followed by noninvasive EMG recordings from abdominal surface in humans&#xD;
      [7-10]. Several studies have attempted to correlate between term and preterm labor to uterine&#xD;
      EMG, with limited success [11-17]. However, although most traditional EMG devices use only 2&#xD;
      electrodes, a multichannel, noninvasive EMG device have been used successfully in previous&#xD;
      studies, both in preterm and term pregnancies, and were proved as both safe and accurate&#xD;
      [18-25]. Recently, reliability studies were published, regarding the comparison to&#xD;
      tocodynamomtery, IUPC and electrical uterine monitoring, using a multichannel EMG, and&#xD;
      demonstrated the multichannel EMG is as good as the IUPC ('Gold Standard') and both&#xD;
      multichannel EMG and IUPC are superior to tocodynamometry in recording uterine activity&#xD;
      [26-27].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study rational Premature labor and delivery heralds great costs to the healthcare system,&#xD;
      including admission costs, tocolytic treatment and side effects and neonatal treatment of the&#xD;
      preterm neonate. Unfortunately, the accuracy of diagnosing preterm labor is poor, with less&#xD;
      than 10% of women presenting with preterm labor symptoms actually delivering within 7 days of&#xD;
      symptoms' onset [28], 30% with resolving symptoms and more than 50% delivering at term [29].&#xD;
      Since IUPC cannot be used in women with intact membranes and tocodynamometry is unreliable,&#xD;
      with previous reports concluding that multichannel EMG is superior to tocodynamomtery and&#xD;
      comparable to IUPC, our objective is to evaluate the utility of the multichannel EMG in women&#xD;
      with preterm contractions.&#xD;
