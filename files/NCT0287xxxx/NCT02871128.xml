    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency problem has always been in Taiwan. This is a randomized, double-blind trial.&#xD;
      Subjects separate to 3 groups, one group (n = 20) take two Natureheme-iron capsules a day for&#xD;
      a total of 12 weeks, another group (n = 20) with the same dose of placebo, and the other&#xD;
      group (n = 20) is a commercial iron supplement. Investigators assess whether Natureheme-iron&#xD;
      can promote iron absorption and antioxidant effects, and compare the effects with commercial&#xD;
      iron supplement. When this study is completed, it will increase the value of Natureheme-iron,&#xD;
      and can improve health of Taiwanese.&#xD;

      FAO / WHO noted that iron deficiency is still an important nutritional problem. Iron&#xD;
      deficiency problem has always been in Taiwan. This study intends to use the products,&#xD;
      Natureheme-iron, using blood of pig to concentration, separation and extracted, and then got&#xD;
      natural and clean Natureheme-iron. Natureheme-iron is not just a good iron supplement, while&#xD;
      also providing an excellent source of natural protein. This is a randomized, double-blind&#xD;
      trial, subjects separate to 3 groups, one group (n = 20) take two Natureheme-iron capsules a&#xD;
      day for a total of 12 weeks (1000mg Fe / capsule), another group (n = 20) with the same dose&#xD;
      of placebo, and the other group (n = 20) is a commercial iron supplement (100mg Fe).&#xD;
      Investigators assess whether Natureheme-iron can promote iron absorption and antioxidant&#xD;
      effects, and compare the effects with commercial iron supplement. When this study is&#xD;
      completed, it will increase the value of Natureheme-iron, and can improve health of&#xD;
      Taiwanese.&#xD;
