  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether using a genetic test (for the SLCO1B1 gene) can help&#xD;
      patients and providers choose the right type and dose of cholesterol-lowering statin&#xD;
      medications to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease, while minimizing the muscle pain&#xD;
      side effects that sometimes occur with statins.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Variants at rs4149056 in the SLCO1B1 gene are associated with a greater risk of&#xD;
      simvastatin-related myopathy. Despite the growing implementation of SLCO1B1 rs4149056&#xD;
      genotyping in health systems across the United States, there is little randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial data on the impact of SLCO1B1 testing on clinical outcomes. The IPICC Study will use a&#xD;
      randomized design to determine the impact of the clinical integration of SLCO1B1 genotype&#xD;
      testing on important patient outcomes, including statin prescribing, LDL cholesterol, and&#xD;
      statin-related myopathy. In addition, by enrolling statin-naive patients with a recent&#xD;
      cholesterol panel, this trial will capture a moment of clinical decision-making when SLCO1B1&#xD;
      rs4149056 genotype might be most clinically relevant. This randomized-control trial has two&#xD;
      primary aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 (Drug safety): To determine the impact of SLCO1B1 pharmacogenetic testing on&#xD;
      concordance with Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) pharmacogenetic&#xD;
      guidelines for safe simvastatin prescribing and on the incidence of statin-related myopathy&#xD;
      in VA (drug safety).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 (Cardiovascular disease, CVD, prevention): To determine the impact of SLCO1B1&#xD;
      pharmacogenetic testing on LDL cholesterol levels and concordance with CVD prevention&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The I-PICC Study is enrolling 408 statin-naive primary care and women's health patients&#xD;
      across the Veteran Affairs Boston Healthcare System. Eligible patients are aged 40-75 and&#xD;
      have elevated risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) according to American College of&#xD;
      Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines. Primary care providers (PCPs) are&#xD;
      also research subjects and consent via electronic health record (EHR) alerts. To model&#xD;
      pharmacogenotyping at the point of care, the investigators are enrolling patients with recent&#xD;
      cholesterol results when their PCPs order laboratory testing, indicating a moment of clinical&#xD;
      decision-making about CVD risk. Enrolled patients are randomized to have their PCPs receive&#xD;
      results through the EHR immediately (PGx+) vs. after 1 year (PGx-). The investigators will&#xD;
      query clinical and pharmacy data for 1-year outcomes: myopathy and concordance with CPIC&#xD;
      simvastatin guidelines (drug safety) and cholesterol levels and concordance with ACC/AHA&#xD;
      guidelines (CVD risk reduction).&#xD;

    <description>In 2013, the ACC/AHA endorsed guidelines that recommended prescribing statins of specific intensities (moderate or high) for distinct populations. Using patient characteristics and prescription data, the investigators will generate a 2-level CVD prevention outcome (concordant vs. non-concordant) for each participant, a measure of whether a patient's statin prescription is adequate for his/her level of CVD risk.</description>

    <description>Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines recommend specific simvastatin doses when a patient's SLCO1B1 genotype is known. The investigators will compare each patient's medication prescriptions one year after enrollment to this guideline to generate a 2-level safety outcome (potentially safe vs. potentially unsafe simvastatin prescription) for each participant.</description>
