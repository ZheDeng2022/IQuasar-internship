    <textblock>
      This project, will combine the data collected from existing and innovative technologies: fMRI&#xD;
      scans, mapping brain connectivity using EEG in combination with eye-tracking technology (the&#xD;
      BNA technology developed by ELMINDA), characterizing of cortical layers using magnetic&#xD;
      resonance (the CoLI technology developed by Tel-Aviv University), and DTI imaging (imaging of&#xD;
      brain tracks). To do so, Sheba's Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, joined the project and is&#xD;
      responsible for recruiting patients from the Department of Neurosurgery and Department of&#xD;
      Rehabilitation and also is responsible for performing the needed tests.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research project is the continuation of the NOFAR project, collaboration between ELMINDA&#xD;
      and Tel-Aviv University, which included a proof of concept of the technology developed in the&#xD;
      university to characterize cortical layers using magnetic resonance. In light of the&#xD;
      promising results, the partners have decided to make another leap forward, and test the&#xD;
      technology amongst specific patient population who suffered a brain trauma (traumatic brain&#xD;
      injury, TBI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early and proper diagnosis of brain injury is critical, since it can prevent further&#xD;
      complications to the patient's health. The tests that are currently available are limited in&#xD;
      their ability to provide a comprehensive and accurate assessment of the injured brain:&#xD;
      imaging exams such as CT, MRI and PET help identify the location and severity of the injury&#xD;
      but cannot provide data on the cognitive and functional effects of the injury. On the other&#xD;
      hand, neuropsychological tests only allow examination of current cognitive functioning, and&#xD;
      cognitive decline quantification is done according to mathematical models and subjective&#xD;
      assessments of the patient and his family. Therefore, this area is lacking and it is&#xD;
      important to find an objective measure that enables quantification of brain injury that will&#xD;
      be an indication of cognitive decline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current project, will last two years, and will combine the data collected from existing&#xD;
      and innovative technologies: fMRI scans, mapping brain connectivity using EEG in combination&#xD;
      with eye-tracking technology (the BNA technology developed by ELMINDA), characterizing of&#xD;
      cortical layers using magnetic resonance (the CoLI technology developed by Tel-Aviv&#xD;
      University), and DTI imaging (imaging of brain tracks). To do so, Sheba's Medical Center, Tel&#xD;
      Hashomer, joined the project and is responsible for recruiting patients from the Department&#xD;
      of Neurosurgery and Department of Rehabilitation and also is responsible for performing the&#xD;
      needed tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The product that will be developed at the end of the Magneton project is expected to be a&#xD;
      unique analysis method that allows examination and monitoring of the affected brain in both a&#xD;
      functional and anatomically-structural ultra-high resolution.&#xD;
