  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease affecting the white matter of the central nervous&#xD;
      system. In France, it concerns approximately 80 000 patients and represents one of the most&#xD;
      frequent neurological affections in young adults. Effort deconditioning of people affected by&#xD;
      MS is already proven, but it is not just linked to the disease itself. The decrease of&#xD;
      capacities to produce an effort is aggravated by neurovegetative and cardiovascular&#xD;
      disorders. The limitation or the complete stop of physical activity is often linked to the&#xD;
      fear of a handicap aggravation. Causes of stop are multiple, including fatigue and balance&#xD;
      disorders, even if the handicap level is low (average EDSS = 2). Walking disorders generated&#xD;
      by MS are frequent, represent the first symptom of the disease (10 to 20 % of cases) and&#xD;
      alter significantly the quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some reeducation programs were proposed in hospitalization with some efficiency on functional&#xD;
      capacities. It is now admitted that physical exercise is not noxious, and allows the&#xD;
      implementation of effort reeducation for MS. Randomized controlled studies have shown in MS&#xD;
      patients an improvement of physical abilities, of O2max (aerobic capacity), of quality of&#xD;
      life and a decrease of fatigue. For MS, only a few studies estimate the effect of effort&#xD;
      reeducation on treadmill. Unfortunately, the efficiency of these programs on walking&#xD;
      endurance are controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the maximal cardiorespiratory effort test, the ventilatory threshold 1 (VT1)&#xD;
      corresponds to a greater increasing of CO2 compared to O2. The identification of VT1 allows&#xD;
      the precise determination of the limit from which the body is incapable of producing the&#xD;
      necessary energy to realize an effort using the aerobic metabolism. The VT1 is situated at a&#xD;
      level of load with enough intensity for the subject to support the test without dyspnea. A&#xD;
      VT1 lower than 40 % of the theoretical VO2 max is considered as a marker of maladjustment to&#xD;
      effort due to dyspnea and excessive muscular fatigue. This indication is very informative&#xD;
      about the quality of life of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to apply a personalized reeducation concerning the working load&#xD;
      pre-hyperventilation to deconditioned subjects, easily worried by effort induced&#xD;
      breathlessness and fatigue in order to get the optimization of the aerobic function. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that reeducation at this level improves the distance of walking and the quality&#xD;
      of life of patients affected by MS.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis is a disease affecting the white matter of the central nervous system. In&#xD;
      France, it concerns approximately 80 000 patients and represents one of the most frequent&#xD;
      neurological affections in young adults. There are several symptoms, including pyramidal&#xD;
      syndrome, sensory syndrome, visual disorders, fatigue, bladder-sphincter disorders, etc. It&#xD;
      is an unpredictable chronic disease. Most of the time, it evolves by relapse at the&#xD;
      beginning, then, after a few years, the disease becomes secondarily progressive. In some&#xD;
      cases, the evolution is directly progressive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efforts oriented to the deconditioning of people affected by multiple sclerosis are already&#xD;
      proven, but they are not only linked to the disease itself. The decrease of capacities to&#xD;
      produce an effort is aggravated by neurovegetative and cardiovascular disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The limitation, even the complete stop, of physical activity is often linked to the fear of a&#xD;
      handicap aggravation. Causes of stop are multiple, including fatigue (general and muscular)&#xD;
      and balance disorders, even if the handicap level is low (average EDSS = 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Walking disorders generated by this pathology are frequent and represent the first symptom of&#xD;
      the disease (10 to 20 % of cases). These walking disorders quickly appear and alter&#xD;
      significantly the quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After several years of evolution, functional effects are more and more pronounced. The&#xD;
      walking perimeter is estimated at 500 meters without help after 7 years of evolution on&#xD;
      average, and no more than 100 meters after 15 years of evolution. At this stage, 50 % of&#xD;
      patients need a technical help to move.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some reeducation programs were proposed in hospitalization with some efficiency on functional&#xD;
      capacities. It is now admitted that physical exercise is not noxious, and allows the&#xD;
      implementation of effort reeducation for this pathology. Randomized controlled studies have&#xD;
      shown in multiple sclerosis patients an improvement of physical abilities, of O2max (aerobic&#xD;
      capacity), a decrease of fatigue and an improvement of quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actually, the cyclo-ergometer is the most common device used for the effort reeducation.&#xD;
      Another approach is the use of a treadmill, based on the improvement of the walking reflex&#xD;
      modeling and the enhancement of the specific walking work, thanks to a high frequency of&#xD;
      repetitions. This device seems more adapted for the improvement of walking disorders than the&#xD;
      cyclo-ergometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this pathology, only a few studies estimated the effect of effort reeducation on&#xD;
      treadmill. Unfortunately, the efficiency of these programs on walking endurance is not well&#xD;
      known and results are controversial. Indeed, only two randomized, controlled trials showed&#xD;
      improvements of the walking speed and the energy cost of walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the impact on the 2-Minute Walk Test (2MWT) was contradictory, probably due to the&#xD;
      population studied (different EDSS and age) and the training duration (4 weeks Vs 8 weeks).&#xD;
      Moreover, in these studies, the effort intensity is most of time determined from an arbitrary&#xD;
      percentage of the theoretical maximal heart rate (HR) or the VO2max.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The heart rate corresponding to the level of load of the ventilatory threshold (VT) described&#xD;
      by Wasserman and al (1973) could be more efficient to measure the intensity of reeducation,&#xD;
      compared to a heart rate (HR) determined from an arbitrary percentage. Four reasons are&#xD;
      highlighted:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The ventilatory threshold represents a well defined metabolic level (individualized&#xD;
           measure)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. According to the subjects, ventilator threshold is not a constant percentage of &quot;O2max&quot;,&#xD;
           and suggests that it is also an individualized measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. During the maximal cardiorespiratory effort test, the ventilatory threshold 1 (VT1)&#xD;
           corresponds to a greater increasing of CO2 compared to O2. The identification of this&#xD;
           threshold allows the precise determination of the limit from which the body is incapable&#xD;
           of producing the necessary energy to realize an effort using the aerobic metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The VT1 is situated at a level of load with enough intensity for the subject to support&#xD;
           the test without dyspnea. A VT1 lower than 40 % of the theoretical VO2 max is considered&#xD;
           as a marker of maladjustment to effort due to dyspnea and excessive muscular fatigue.&#xD;
           This indication is very informative about the quality of life of patients.&#xD;
