      This is a multi-center, open-label study to evaluate the long-term safety of weekly IV&#xD;
      infusions of 60 mg/kg Alpha-1 MP in adult subjects with AATD in Japan who have completed&#xD;
      Study GTI1401. Study GTI1401 is being conducted to evaluate the safety and PK of Alpha-1 MP&#xD;
      in subjects with AATD in Japan. In the current study, GTI1401-OLE, subjects will be&#xD;
      administered 60 mg/kg Alpha-1 MP by weekly IV infusion for approximately 1 year (can be&#xD;
      renewed annually with the consent of the subjects unless the sponsor informs of&#xD;
      discontinuation of this OLE trial) to assess the long-term safety of Alpha-1 MP in subjects&#xD;
      with AATD. This study will be conducted at up to 5 centers in Japan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Week 9 Visit of Study GTI1401, after giving consent, on the same day, subjects will be&#xD;
      assessed for eligibility at Screening/Extention (Ext) Week 1 Visit for this extension study,&#xD;
      Study GTI1401-OLE. If eligible, subjects will be administered weekly IV infusions of 60 mg/kg&#xD;
      Alpha-1 MP for approximately 1 year or longer. The Week 9 Visit of GTI1401 will be the End of&#xD;
      Study Visit for the subjects who are enrolled in Study GTI1401-OLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in Study GTI1401-OLE will have the option to remain in Study GTI1401-OLE and&#xD;
      continue to receive weekly IV infusions of 60 mg/kg Alpha-1 MP for another year or longer. If&#xD;
      subjects plan to conclude their participation in the study (GTI1401-OLE) early (before Ext.&#xD;
      Week 52), they will be asked to complete the End of Study Follow-Up Assessments, which will&#xD;
      be scheduled 4 weeks after the last infusion.&#xD;
