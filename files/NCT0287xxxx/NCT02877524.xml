  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical course of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with&#xD;
      recurrent episodes of exacerbation that results in respiratory failure. The treatment of&#xD;
      respiratory failure is supportive and involves inhalation bronchodilators along with systemic&#xD;
      steroids. In few cases the management of acute respiratory failure requires positive pressure&#xD;
      ventilation (non-invasive or invasive). The use of NIV in acute exacerbation of COPD has&#xD;
      resulted in significant reduction in morbidity and mortality. Although pressure support&#xD;
      ventilation (PSV) allows the patient to influence the breathing pattern, ventilator-cycling&#xD;
      criteria may worsen the patient-ventilator interaction, and severe asynchronies occur in up&#xD;
      to 43% of patients undergoing NIV for ARF. Adaptive support ventilation (ASV) is a newer mode&#xD;
      of ventilation that incorporates feedback mechanisms and thus provides a stable minute&#xD;
      ventilation. We hypothesize that the use of ASV as a mode during ventilation using NIV in&#xD;
      patients with acute exacerbation of COPD may result in reducing the duration of ventilatory&#xD;
      support, need for intubation, and duration of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length&#xD;
      of stay, when compared with PSV mode of NIV ventilation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common respiratory disease, which is&#xD;
      characterized by airflow limitation. It affects more than 3.49 per cent of adults &gt;35 year&#xD;
      and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. The national burden of chronic&#xD;
      bronchitis is estimated at 14.84 million.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical course of COPD is punctuated by acute exacerbations, which can lead to&#xD;
      hypercapnic respiratory failure. The development of respiratory failure is associated with&#xD;
      high morbidity and mortality, and significant healthcare costs. The requirement of&#xD;
      ventilatory support also portends a reduced survival in this group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The introduction of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) has resulted in a paradigm shift in the&#xD;
      management of patients with acute exacerbation of COPD. First, reported in 1989, by Meduri et&#xD;
      all, the successful application of NIV via full-face mask in 10 patients, and the avoidance&#xD;
      of intubation in 8 of them (4 of 6 with COPD, 2 of 2 with congestive heart failure, and 2 of&#xD;
      2 with pneumonia), demonstrated the efficacy of NIV in the management of acute exacerbation&#xD;
      of COPD. This new modality was successful in avoiding of many of the complications associated&#xD;
      with invasive mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, NIV is instituted with the pressure support mode of ventilation. Wherein, the&#xD;
      inspiratory pressure was initiated at 6-8 cm of water and expiratory pressure was set at 3-4&#xD;
      cm. The difference between the two pressures provided the ventilatory support. These&#xD;
      pressures were then titrated based on patient clinical improvement by the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adaptive support ventilation (ASV) is one of the newer modes of ventilation, described by&#xD;
      Tehrani et al in 1991 and was designed to minimise the work of breathing, mimic natural&#xD;
      breathing and stimulate breathing and reduce weaning time. It is a closed loop system, which&#xD;
      incorporates various feedback mechanisms into its algorithm. The operator inputs patients&#xD;
      weight, from that the ventilator calculates required minute alveolar ventilation assuming&#xD;
      normal dead space fraction. Then an optimal frequency is calculated based on Otis equation.&#xD;
      The target tidal volume is calculated by MV/f. The inspiratory pressure within a breath is&#xD;
      controlled to achieve a constant value and between the breaths the inspiratory pressure is&#xD;
      adjusted to achieve a target tidal volume. It aims to provide a target minute ventilation by&#xD;
      adjusting automatically the delivered pressure and respiratory rate while keeping the work of&#xD;
      breathing to a minimum by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to its ability to reduce the work of breathing and meet the flow requirement of the&#xD;
      patient by adjusting both the flow and respiratory rate depending on the respiratory&#xD;
      mechanics, the use of ASV as a mode of ventilation during NIV may improve patient-ventilator&#xD;
      synchrony. A study comparing ASV versus pressure support ventilation in intubated patients&#xD;
      with acute exacerbation of COPD demonstrated that the use of ASV mode was associated with&#xD;
      shorter weaning times with similar weaning success rates. However, a study comparing the use&#xD;
      of ASV mode versus PSV mode during non-invasive ventilation has not been done previously.&#xD;
      Patient-ventilator synchronization is critical for reducing the work of breathing and for&#xD;
      successful NIV. Although PSV allows the patient to influence the breathing pattern,&#xD;
      ventilator-cycling criteria may worsen the patient-ventilator interaction, and severe&#xD;
      asynchronies occur in up to 43% of patients undergoing NIV for ARF. We hypothesize that the&#xD;
      use of ASV as a mode during ventilation using NIV in patients with acute exacerbation of COPD&#xD;
      may result in reducing the duration of ventilatory support, need for intubation, and duration&#xD;
      of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay, when compared with PSV mode of NIV&#xD;
      ventilation.&#xD;
