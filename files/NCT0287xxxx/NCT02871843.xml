  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part Phase I add-on clinical trial in newly diagnosed glioblastoma or GBM. By&#xD;
      &quot;add-on&quot; what is meant is that the experimental intravenous therapy, RRx-001, is combined or&#xD;
      &quot;added on&quot; to standard of care. In newly diagnosed GBM standard of care consists of&#xD;
      radiotherapy + temozolomide (TMZ) for 6 weeks followed (after a 4-6 weeks break) by&#xD;
      maintenance TMZ given until the tumor progresses or worsens. By &quot;maintenance&quot; therapy what is&#xD;
      meant is that TMZ is given less frequently to prolong or extend the time during which the&#xD;
      tumor remains stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G-FORCE-1 will be conducted in two parts; in the first part of the study (Dose Escalation,&#xD;
      Part A) patients will be entered or assigned sequentially (that is consecutively) to&#xD;
      gradually escalating or increasing doses of RRx-001 after patients have been entered on the&#xD;
      previous dose until such time as it is no longer tolerated. At each dose level, a separate&#xD;
      cohort or small group of at least 3 evaluable patients will be treated. RRx-001 will be&#xD;
      administered by intravenous infusion (in other words, by slow injection in the veins) over&#xD;
      30-45 minutes once weekly during radiotherapy for 6 weeks followed by the FDA-approved&#xD;
      chemotherapy, temozolomide (TMZ) alone for up to 6 months or longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second part of this study (Part B), new groups or cohorts of patients will receive&#xD;
      RRx-001 at the dose established in Part A by intravenous infusion over 30-45 minutes once&#xD;
      weekly during radiotherapy for 6 weeks. Then, after a 4-6 weeks break, each cohort will&#xD;
      receive increasing doses of RRx-001 and temozolomide (in other words, a double dose&#xD;
      escalation) to establish an acceptable safety and activity window, in other words, a dose&#xD;
      range that is relatively free of toxicity as well as active against the tumor, although the&#xD;
      primary purpose of this study is to assess or evaluate safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reason or rationale to &quot;add on&quot; RRx-001 to radiotherapy and TMZ, which is described in&#xD;
      more detail below on this page, is as follows: RRx-001 is a radiosensitizer and a&#xD;
      chemosensitizer, which means that experimentally it increases the activity of radiation and&#xD;
      chemotherapy in tumors. In addition, in other ongoing clinical trials, patients have&#xD;
      experienced minimal toxicity or side effects with RRx-001 alone and also in combination with&#xD;
      radiation in the brain; therefore, the hope is that RRx-001 will synergize or combine well&#xD;
      with radiotherapy and TMZ in GBM without adding toxicity&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma multiforme also known by the feared three letter acronym or abbreviation, GBM,&#xD;
      is the most common, aggressive and deadly type of brain tumor, which is standardly treated&#xD;
      with a combination of radiation and temozolomide (TMZ), an FDA approved chemotherapy agent,&#xD;
      followed by temozolomide alone. One of the reasons why glioblastoma is so aggressive and&#xD;
      deadly has to do with poor blood flow: it turns out that GBM has multiple inefficient and&#xD;
      leaky blood vessels, which leads to ineffective and irregular delivery of nutrients and&#xD;
      oxygen to the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As illogical as it may sound at first, depriving cancer cells of the oxygen and vital&#xD;
      nutrients that they need to grow actually makes them more (not less as might be expected)&#xD;
      aggressive and harder to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here's why: for radiation to have an effect on the tumor oxygen is required since the&#xD;
      combination of oxygen and radiation produces unstable and highly reactive free radicals;&#xD;
      these microscopic free radicals are the equivalent of a spray of bullets, which ricochet or&#xD;
      bounce around violently inside the tumor producing catastrophic damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Likewise, for chemotherapy such as TMZ to work it has to reach the tumor and when blood&#xD;
      vessels are so abnormal that the blood practically ceases to flow the TMZ, for example, may&#xD;
      either never actually get there or may arrive in such small quantities that it is&#xD;
      ineffective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expression &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; also applies: under the poorly oxygenated harsh&#xD;
      conditions, which result from this sluggish blood flow only the toughest and most resistant&#xD;
      cancer cells survive, making the tumor that much harder to eliminate with traditional&#xD;
      therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Think of the blood flow to the tumor as a swamp or a marsh where the rotten water seeps and&#xD;
      pools rather than flows and where only the hardiest organisms can compete for scarce&#xD;
      resources and low oxygen, which partly explains why this GBM tumor type in particular is&#xD;
      often so hard to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial, called G-FORCE-1, tests the safety, tolerability and activity of&#xD;
      RRx-001, an experimental anticancer agent, with standard radiation and temozolomide followed&#xD;
      by temozolomide + RRx-001 in newly diagnosed GBM. Evidence in animals and in human patients&#xD;
      with brain metastases, that is cancer cells, which have metastasized or spread to the brain&#xD;
      from different locations in the body, has shown that RRx-001, which has many anticancer&#xD;
      mechanisms and is generally very well tolerated both alone and in combination with radiation&#xD;
      in other clinical trials, increases blood flow to tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The increased blood flow has three possible beneficial consequences: 1) more oxygen is&#xD;
      delivered to the tumor, which has the potential to increase the activity of radiation 2) more&#xD;
      TMZ makes it to the tumor, which has the potential to increase the activity of TMZ and 3) as&#xD;
      conditions in the tumor gradually improve from intolerable or barely tolerable to more&#xD;
      acceptable, treatment sensitive cancer cells may start to reappear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RRx-001 is also thought to work by stimulating the immune system to attack the tumor; tumor&#xD;
      biopsies or samples from patients in other RRx-001 trials have demonstrated the infiltration&#xD;
      or penetration of a particular kind of white cell called T-cells. As a fourth potentially&#xD;
      beneficial consequence of the increased blood flow from RRx-001, these immune T-cells may&#xD;
      have better access to the tumor, which may, in turn, increase killing of the cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G-FORCE-1 is a Phase 1 trial, which means that the main endpoint is to test the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of RRx-001 in combination with radiation and temozolomide and not its activity;&#xD;
      however patients will be followed for responses to treatment and overall survival&#xD;
