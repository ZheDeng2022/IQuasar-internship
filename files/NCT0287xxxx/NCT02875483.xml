  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over 50% of all pregnancies that occur in the US are unintended, and unintended pregnancy is&#xD;
      detrimental to maternal and child health. Tubal sterilization may be performed immediately&#xD;
      following a delivery, or as an interval procedure remote from pregnancy. Many women request&#xD;
      sterilization to follow delivery, but it is frequently not completed during the peri-partum&#xD;
      hospitalization. Women who are denied an immediate post-partum tubal are generally candidates&#xD;
      to complete the procedure as an interval surgery within a few months of delivery, but few do&#xD;
      so. Women who request tubal sterilization and do not receive it are at highest risk for a&#xD;
      rapid repeat pregnancy, with as many as 46% having an unintended pregnancy within 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard care at many institutions for a patient denied tubal sterilization during&#xD;
      hospitalization is to offer a short term contraceptive and instruct the patient to follow up&#xD;
      for the standard post-partum outpatient visit in 4-6 weeks. If the patient still desires&#xD;
      tubal sterilization at that time, the surgical procedure will be scheduled. No-show rates for&#xD;
      post-partum care are high at about 50%-60%, and therefore, many patients are never scheduled&#xD;
      for their surgery. If the process of scheduling interval tubal sterilization surgery could be&#xD;
      expedited, rates of completion could be improved.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Identification of potential participants: On admission to the hospital for labor, all women&#xD;
      will be asked if they were planning to tie their tubes after their delivery. Women who&#xD;
      requested tubal ligation and have not received this on post-partum day one, and who are not&#xD;
      anticipated to have it completed on post-partum days 2 or 3, and who did not have a&#xD;
      contraceptive device (IUD or Nexplanon) placed that the time of delivery will be identified&#xD;
      from hospital service lists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment: All patients meeting inclusion criteria will be approached by study personnel and&#xD;
      asked about whether sterilization is their preferred contraceptive method. If the potential&#xD;
      participant still expresses a desire for permanent sterilization, the potential participant&#xD;
      will be offered enrollment in the study. The study will be described, and the expected&#xD;
      preferred method of sterilization identified. The participant will sign informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation Concealment: A randomization sequence will be developed with a computerized number&#xD;
      generator, and will generate participant assignments in a 1:1 ration with randomly permuted&#xD;
      block sizes of 4, 6, and 8. A person not involved with study enrollment will place cards with&#xD;
      participant assignments in a series of sequentially numbered, sealed opaque sealed envelopes.&#xD;
      These envelopes will be stored on the post partum floor, and after a patient completes the&#xD;
      informed consent, the next sequential envelope will be opened.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: The potential candidate will be randomized by opening of the next sequentially&#xD;
      numbered sealed envelope. The assignment will be noted and disclosed. The assignment will be&#xD;
      noted in the study chart, and the card with the assignment will be stored with the chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol following randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant is assigned to the standard care arm, the participant will be instructed&#xD;
      to present for her post-partum visit, and that surgical procedure will be scheduled at that&#xD;
      time. These participants will be offered appropriate short term contraceptive. This reflects&#xD;
      current standard of care regarding post-partum follow up and contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant is assigned to the expedited scheduling arm, the preferred method of&#xD;
      sterilization (laparoscopic or hysteroscopic) will be confirmed. The available dates for&#xD;
      surgery in the appropriate window (4-8 weeks post-partum) will be offered, and the&#xD;
      participant will confirm her preferred dates. The surgery scheduling team will be contacted,&#xD;
      and the patient will be placed on the schedule. If a date cannot be definitively confirmed&#xD;
      prior to discharge, the participant will be instructed to expect a call from the surgery&#xD;
      schedulers to confirm the surgical date within 3 days of hospital discharge. In that phone&#xD;
      call, administrators will provide information for pre-admission testing date to complete&#xD;
      preoperative laboratory work if needed. The participant will be instructed to schedule a&#xD;
      routine post-partum visit as well per usual protocols. All participants will be offered the&#xD;
      appropriate short-term contraceptive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up after hospital discharge. Patients in the expedited group will receive the standard&#xD;
      phone calls from the surgery scheduling team regarding pre-operative appointments and the&#xD;
      peri-operative nurses on the day prior to schedule surgery. Participants will not receive any&#xD;
      other specialized reminders regarding their surgical date or intentions for follow up. If&#xD;
      participants contact the office requesting a change to a surgical date, this will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Per usual surgical procedures, if participants do not present for their scheduled surgery,&#xD;
      they will be contacted and offered an opportunity to re-schedule. If participants miss more&#xD;
      than one scheduled surgery date, they will not be contacted further to re-schedule; however,&#xD;
      if the participant calls the office to schedule independently, another surgical date will be&#xD;
      offered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the standard of care group will receive standard discharge summary and&#xD;
      instructions which include instruction to contact the outpatient OB-Gyn office to schedule&#xD;
      post-partum follow-up in about 6 weeks. Once scheduled for an appointment, participants will&#xD;
      receive the standard automated appointment reminder call or text. Participants will not&#xD;
      receive any specialized reminders regarding follow-up for either routine post-partum care or&#xD;
      regarding scheduling of sterilization surgery. Participants will not be seen by study&#xD;
      personnel at this visit to encourage or facilitate scheduling of tubal, as the goal is for&#xD;
      this group to receive current standard care. Data regarding the outcome of this visit will be&#xD;
      abstracted from the post-partum chart by study personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Completion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be considered exited from the study at these endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tubal is completed as scheduled - do satisfaction survey: study complete&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Seen for follow up, and state definitively that they have changed mind about tubal and&#xD;
           no longer desire it - do satisfaction survey: study complete (Survey B for survey&#xD;
           specific to those who have changed their mind regarding tubal)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are seen for follow up within 6 month, state intention to complete tubal. It is done&#xD;
           within 6 months. Do survey at time of tubal: study complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are seen for follow up within 6 months, state intention to complete tubal, but it has&#xD;
           not been completed at 6 month mark - will be contacted by phone, queried about barriers&#xD;
           and why not done, and complete satisfaction survey: study complete (Survey C for survey&#xD;
           specific to non-completion of follow up)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are not seen for follow up at all within 6 months - will be contacted by phone at&#xD;
           6-month point to determine if tubal done elsewhere, method of contraception, interval&#xD;
           pregnancy, complete satisfaction survey (Survey C): study complete&#xD;
