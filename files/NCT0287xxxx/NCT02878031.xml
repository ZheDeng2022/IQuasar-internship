      This one-arm safety intervention study is aimed at increasing access to treatment of&#xD;
      pneumonia by training CHWs, locally referred to as Community Oriented Resource Persons&#xD;
      (CORPs), to manage chest indrawing pneumonia using oral amoxicillin, conducting follow-ups&#xD;
      and recording their findings in case report forms. CORPs will also be involved in improving&#xD;
      care seeking for pneumonia in children by training them to conduct health education sessions&#xD;
      for men and women in their respective communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess if CORPs can safely and appropriately manage chest&#xD;
      indrawing pneumonia in 2-59 month old children, and refer children with danger signs. The&#xD;
      primary outcomes will be the proportion of children under five with chest indrawing pneumonia&#xD;
      who were managed appropriately by CORPs and the clinical treatment failure of chest indrawing&#xD;
      pneumonia. Secondary outcomes will include proportion of children with chest indrawing&#xD;
      followed up by CORPs on day 3 and caregiver adherence to treatment for CI, and clinical&#xD;
      relapse of pneumonia between day 7 to 14 among children whose signs of pneumonia disappeared&#xD;
      by day 6. Approximately 308 children 2-59 months of age with chest indrawing pneumonia would&#xD;
      be needed for this safety intervention study.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES AND RATIONALE This one-arm safety intervention study aims to establish whether&#xD;
      CHWs in Nigeria can safely manage chest indrawing pneumonia in 2-59 month old children. The&#xD;
      primary outcomes will be the proportion of children under five with chest indrawing pneumonia&#xD;
      who were managed appropriately by Community Oriented Resources Persons (CORPs) and the&#xD;
      clinical treatment failure by day 6. Secondary outcomes will include proportion of children&#xD;
      with chest indrawing followed up by CORPs on day 3, clinical relapse of pneumonia between day&#xD;
      7 to 14 and acceptability and satisfaction with outpatient management of chest indrawing&#xD;
      pneumonia. A total of 308 children 2-59 months of age with chest indrawing pneumonia will be&#xD;
      needed for this safety intervention study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY Introduction Malaria Consortium (MC) intends to implement&#xD;
      the WHO study, funded under the Rapid Access Expansion 2015 programme (RAcE 2015), on&#xD;
      community case management of chest indrawing pneumonia with oral amoxicillin in children aged&#xD;
      2-59 months old by CORPs and submits this proposal for Niger state, Nigeria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study area Proposed study population Niger State, located in Nigeria's North Central Zone, is&#xD;
      geographically the largest of the country's states, covering 76,263 km2. The state has a&#xD;
      projected population of almost 5 million. Children under five years make up 21% of the&#xD;
      population, and pregnant women constitute 5%. The population is made up of Muslims,&#xD;
      Christians with a small minority practising traditional beliefs. The majority of the&#xD;
      population are spread across rural areas, with 30% of the population living in urban areas.&#xD;
      Under WHO RAcE 2015 project MC is working with the Federal Ministry of Health (FMoH) to&#xD;
      strengthen the iCCM programme in six (LGAs) in the three zones in Niger state: Paikoro; Rafi;&#xD;
      Mariga; Rijau; Lapai; and Edati. The total population of the six LGAs is 1,245,939 of whom&#xD;
      approximately 249,200 are children aged 2-59 months. Pneumonia remains the leading cause of&#xD;
      under 5 child mortality in Nigeria which, together with India, contributes the highest&#xD;
      absolute numbers of pneumonia deaths in the world, with 804,429 deaths in children under five&#xD;
      years in 2013 (2). The expected incidence of clinical pneumonia in this area in Nigeria is&#xD;
      0.28/child/year with an estimated 12% progressing to severe disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives and outcomes This one-arm safety intervention study aims to establish whether CHWs&#xD;
      in Nigeria can safely and appropriately manage chest indrawing pneumonia in 2-59 month old&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes will be the proportion of children under five classified with chest&#xD;
      indrawing pneumonia who were managed appropriately by Community Oriented Resources Persons&#xD;
      (CORPs) and the clinical treatment failure of chest indrawing pneumonia by day 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of children classified with chest indrawing who were followed up by the CORPs&#xD;
           on day 3&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical relapse of pneumonia between day 7 to 14 among children whose signs of&#xD;
           pneumonia disappeared by day 6&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CORPs' acceptability of and caregiver satisfaction with outpatient management of chest&#xD;
           indrawing pneumonia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and sampling Using the sample size calculation for a prevalence survey with&#xD;
      finite population correction; an assumption that the proportion of the main indicator is 50%&#xD;
      (to give the most conservative sample size); and a confidence interval of 95%, a total of 196&#xD;
      children with chest indrawing will be needed to estimate overall proportion of children with&#xD;
      chest indrawing pneumonia who experience treatment failure by day 6 with Â±7% precision.&#xD;
      Adjusting for a 10% non-response rate for caregivers, 10% erroneous enrolments, and a cluster&#xD;
      effect of 1.3 in case more than one child is enrolled by one CORP, a total sample size of 308&#xD;
      children under five with chest indrawing will be required. After 12 months of data&#xD;
      collection, an interim analysis of the event rates (primary outcome) and enrolment rates is&#xD;
      planned to assess progress towards the sample size target. Should it be discovered that the&#xD;
      event rate is far off from the assumption of 0.5, the final sample size may be modified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With approximately 28,000 children 2-59 months old in the study area, assuming 7,840 fast&#xD;
      breathing cases per year (0.28 episodes/child/year), and a 12% chest indrawing incidence the&#xD;
      area would have approximately 940 chest indrawing cases per year. To enrol the 308 children&#xD;
      with chest indrawing needed for the study during a 12 months study period we would need all&#xD;
      the 203 CORPs in the LGA to see approximately 30% of the sick children in the community,&#xD;
      which we believe is highly feasible given our experience with iCCM programmes uptake in other&#xD;
      parts of Africa and the fact that we shall implement community mobilisation activities to&#xD;
      support engagement with the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case identification by CORPs will be mainly through passive case detection and through&#xD;
      periodic community outreach activities. Based on epidemiological data, over a period of study&#xD;
      data collection of 12 months maximum, each CORP is anticipated to enrol 1-2 children with&#xD;
      chest indrawing. CORPs will assess all children presenting to their house and manage them&#xD;
      according to study protocol. All sick infants younger than 2 months will be referred to the&#xD;
      reference facility. All children 2-59 months of age with chest indrawing but no danger signs&#xD;
      will be considered eligible for enrolment in the study and consent will be obtained from the&#xD;
      primary caregiver. CORPs will screen the children for study enrolment, and takes consent from&#xD;
      the guardian of the child to take part in the study. If the caregiver of the eligible child&#xD;
      has consented, the CORP prescribes dispersible amoxicillin according to age-specific&#xD;
      standards, schedules follow-up visits for day 0 (&lt;12hrs), 3, 6 and 15 with caregiver of&#xD;
      enrolled child, attaches a unique identifier (UI) to the sick child recording form of&#xD;
      enrolled child and copies the UI number onto all copies of the consent form and gives a&#xD;
      missed call to the RA to notify them of enrolled child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RA will visit the household of the child as soon as possible after the child has been&#xD;
      enrolled and latest within 12 hours of enrolment by the CORP. Before going to the child's&#xD;
      household, the RA will go to the CORP to verify the enrolment and get details of the child's&#xD;
      location. The CORP will visit the child three days after enrolment (day 3) to ensure there is&#xD;
      no deterioration in the child's condition and if necessary, refer the child to a health&#xD;
      facility if symptoms have deteriorated. On day 6 and 15 after enrolment, RAs together with&#xD;
      CORPs will visit all children enrolled and interview the caregivers using a mobile phone data&#xD;
      collection form. Clinical relapse of pneumonia will be determined based on child's clinical&#xD;
      condition assessed on day 15 (see table 4 for detailed definition of primary and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes). If on any of the follow-up days, enrolled children cannot be found at home, the&#xD;
      CORP/RA will follow up with the caregiver to find out where the child is, and make every&#xD;
      effort to see the child, even if they are classified as lost to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection, supervision and outcome assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      DAY 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CORPs' performance will be established through a re-assessment of the child by a research&#xD;
      assistant (RA) who will visit the household of the child as soon as possible after the child&#xD;
      has been enrolled and latest within 12 hours of enrolment by the CORP. The RA will use a&#xD;
      tablet based sick child assessment tool which walks the RA through questions about the child,&#xD;
      including current health status and symptoms present at the time of care seeking at the&#xD;
      CORPs, treatment given by CORP, and other treatments provided for the current illness&#xD;
      episode. A handheld pulse oximeter will be used by the RAs to detect symptoms of hypoxemia.&#xD;
      If a child is found to have danger signs or hypoxemia, or any other illness that was not&#xD;
      treated by the CORP, the RA will facilitate referral to the nearest health facility and will&#xD;
      be excluded from the study. For children with chest indrawings referred by the CORPs because&#xD;
      of suspected presence of danger signs, the RA will trace the child in the referral facility&#xD;
      (or at home in case of referral refusal) to conduct the re-assessment visit. Children found&#xD;
      not to have chest indrawing will continue the course of antibiotic they were already&#xD;
      prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DAY 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Families of enrolled children will be encouraged to return to the CORPs on 3 days after&#xD;
      enrolment for reassessment by the CORP, as is standard under iCCM. During the this visit, the&#xD;
      CORP will reassess the child, record findings (including temperature and presence/absence of&#xD;
      chest indrawing and other treatments, if any, received by the child), inquire and record if&#xD;
      the caretaker provided the amoxicillin tablets according to the recommended treatment&#xD;
      schedule, and counsel the mother to administer the next doses. If a child is not brought back&#xD;
      on the scheduled visit day, the CORP will visit the child at home on day 3 and 6. If the CORP&#xD;
      determines that the condition of an enrolled child has deteriorated, s/he will refer the&#xD;
      child to the reference facility or call the supervisor for further evaluation. Data on a&#xD;
      standard set of variables will be collected during each visit. The study supervisors will&#xD;
      verify that visits are being made and information is being collected by reviewing data&#xD;
      uploads on the back-end server.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DAYS 6-15:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 6 and 15 after enrolment, RAs and CORPs will visit all children enrolled and interview&#xD;
      the caregivers using the mobile phone data collection form. Questions will include current&#xD;
      health status (using the IMCI algorithm), adherence to treatment (using pill count), care&#xD;
      providers visited after visiting the CORP, alternative treatments given (other than what CORP&#xD;
      provided), and hospitalisation. Clinical relapse of pneumonia will be determined based on&#xD;
      child's clinical condition assessed on day 15. If enrolled children cannot be found at home&#xD;
      during the day 6 and day 15 visits, the RA will follow up with a phone call to the caregiver&#xD;
      to ensure that there is no loss-to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the household visits on day 6 and 15, a selection of 25 CORPs and 25 child&#xD;
      caregivers will be asked to participate in unstructured interviews to document CORPs'&#xD;
      acceptability of and caregiver satisfaction with outpatient management of chest indrawing&#xD;
      pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study coordinator will visit all of the treatment failures (secondary outcome) for&#xD;
      reassessment of the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring and evaluation, including a summary of the data analysis plan A system for regular&#xD;
      monitoring will be introduced to ensure that study activities are implemented as per plan,&#xD;
      using approved operating procedures. CORP service statistics on patients seen and referrals&#xD;
      made will be captured from both CORPs paper-based reports. This data will be compiled by a&#xD;
      data manager, interpreted by the study coordinator and shared with program managers on a&#xD;
      regular basis. The data manager will regularly review all data submissions for enrolled&#xD;
      children, including checklists submitted by RAs on Day 0-1, 6 and 15, as well as follow-up&#xD;
      forms submitted by CORPs on day 3. These submissions will be checked for completeness and&#xD;
      accuracy before being anonymised by assigning each enrolled child a unique study number and&#xD;
      using this number to store the case data in a project database. While all data collection&#xD;
      forms will have inbuilt consistency and range checks, any additional discrepancies identified&#xD;
      will be raised during supervision visits. An automatically generated report containing&#xD;
      information on children enrolled, children followed up and children who died, had clinical&#xD;
      treatment failure or who had a clinical relapse of pneumonia will be generated for review on&#xD;
      a monthly basis and be made available to the PIs, co-investigators and the donor.&#xD;
