      The purpose of this study will be to study the individual spatiotemporal structure and&#xD;
      dynamics of topologically defined areas of perceived body discomfort and pain during&#xD;
      exercise. Participants will perform two constant tests (cycling and running) at an intensity&#xD;
      corresponding to Borg's scale of Rating of Perceived Exhaustion (RPE) (6-20) = 15 (i.e.,&#xD;
      hard). Using a body map template, participants will report every 15s the perceived locations&#xD;
      with discomfort and pain independently of the magnitude of the discomfort and pain.&#xD;

      1. Intro Pain recently was defined as distressing experience associated with actual or&#xD;
           potential tissue damage with sensory, cognitive, emotional, and social components. Pain&#xD;
           can be seen as perceptual marker within physical exercise. Individuals can report on a&#xD;
           number of perceptual markers such as the changes in exertive pain which was shown to be&#xD;
           a distinct source of information than reports of PE during cycling for instance. The&#xD;
           perceptual markers of pain are still little investigated within exercise settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
           From another side, to best understand exertive pain, one needs to consider several&#xD;
           dimensions of pain including the sensory-discriminative, affective-motivational, and the&#xD;
           cognitive-evaluative dimensions. Several number of studies within the exercise science&#xD;
           have focused on the sensory-discriminative dimension of pain. Results from these have&#xD;
           suggested a linear relationship between pain perception and the power output in diverse&#xD;
           effort settings including cycling, static and dynamic handgrip squeezing, and&#xD;
           incremental treadmill running. Indeed, the comparison of ratio of leg pain to arm pain&#xD;
           during cycling and running has also demonstrated that the ratio of leg to arm pain&#xD;
           increases across higher intensities.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Most of the extant work however centred on pain and PE from a group-based standpoint to&#xD;
           lead to group-based conclusions. Traditionally, within exercise science, variables are&#xD;
           measured at distinct, low-frequency time points, and then are either averaged over the&#xD;
           course of the trial or reported at the measured time. In turn, such practices make it&#xD;
           difficult to measure dynamic feed-forward and feedback control mechanisms inherent in&#xD;
           these variables. Taken these together, studying pain and discomfort from an individual,&#xD;
           case-by-case standpoint, in a high-frequency time points setting, may present unique&#xD;
           benefits. Considering that the physiological and psychological variables (e.g., PE)&#xD;
           present fluctuations during heavy constant-power cycling when reporting at a measurement&#xD;
           frequency of 15s it seems plausible to assume that pain locations can also fluctuate.&#xD;
           Consequently, it may be useful to distinguish amongst differential types of&#xD;
           spatiotemporal pain fluctuations patterns during exercise. Mapping these dynamics can&#xD;
           help predict individual-specific fatigue in the course of exercise. The functional role&#xD;
           of fluctuating dynamics has already been studied in psychological (e.g., volitional&#xD;
           states, thought processes) and kinematic variables during constant-power exercise&#xD;
           performed until volitional exhaustion. These approaches are important in that the&#xD;
           suppression of the intra- individual variability performed by a statistical averaging&#xD;
           may hide the properties of individual systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In this vein, we tend to study and delineate individualized pain and discomfort patterns&#xD;
           in exercise. The purpose of this study will be to study the individual spatiotemporal&#xD;
           structure and dynamics of topologically defined areas of perceived body discomfort and&#xD;
           pain during exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Methods 2.1 Participants To determine the sample size for this study a power analysis&#xD;
           was conducted using G*Power 3.1. In studies of thought processes larger effect sizes&#xD;
           have been reported. Thus, using an effect size of d = 1.0, α &lt; 0.05, power (1 - β) =&#xD;
           0.80, a sample size of n = 11 emerged. Caucasian physical education students (age range:&#xD;
           18 - 30 years) undergoing regular aerobic exercise will be recruited to participate&#xD;
           voluntarily in the study. Students will receive oral and written information regarding&#xD;
           the study. They will be additionally encouraged to ask questions if there would still&#xD;
           any ambiguities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Materials and procedure Completion of this study will took a total of three sessions,&#xD;
      separated by one-week intervals, and each of approximately 30 minutes. At week one,&#xD;
      participants will complete a baseline incremental cycling and running tests to determine the&#xD;
      workload and velocity values corresponding to their RPE (6-20 Borg's scale) = 15 (i.e.,&#xD;
      heavy). At this time, participants also will be familiarized with the use of body maps and&#xD;
      reporting procedures. At week two and three, participants will complete the constant-power&#xD;
      cycling and constant velocity running tasks, respectively, in a counter-balanced assigned&#xD;
      order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2.1. Monitoring for Discomfort and Pain Every 15s during exercise, upon the researcher's&#xD;
      prompts, participants will report bodily locations with discomfort and pain on a body map&#xD;
      scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2.2. Constant-power Cycling Task The task will include an incremental warm-up session and a&#xD;
      constant-power cycling which will be performed up to volitional exhaustion. The&#xD;
      constant-power cycling will begin when participants will report RPE = 15 during the&#xD;
      incremental warm-up and the cycling task will last up to volitional exhaustion. The end will&#xD;
      be set when participants won't be able to cycle longer at the fixed cadence for five&#xD;
      consecutive seconds at the sitting position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2.3. Constant-velocity Running Task The task will include an incremental warm-up (identical&#xD;
      to the running baseline test) and a constant velocity run which will be performed up to&#xD;
      volitional exhaustion. The constant velocity run will start when participants will achieve&#xD;
      and report RPE = 15 during the incremental warm-up and will last up to volitional exhaustion&#xD;
      when they could no longer be able to maintain the imposed velocity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2.4. Commitment check Upon the completion of all testing procedures participants will&#xD;
      answer questions about complete commitment to measure their commitment levels to the&#xD;
      reporting tasks (a) and commitment to task (b), on an 11-point Likert-type scale with anchors&#xD;
      ranging from 0 (not at all) to 10 (greatly).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Data collection and analysis All the locations for each participant will be transformed&#xD;
      to binary vectors. Investigators will analyse the effects of the time steps using repeated&#xD;
      measures ANOVAs. Principal component analysis (PCA) will be used to reduce the dimensionality&#xD;
      of the local discomfort and/or pain data (that will be obtained from the 50-item pain map).&#xD;
      The data and time of each testing session will be reported in a list. All data can be&#xD;
      reconstructed for each participants.&#xD;
