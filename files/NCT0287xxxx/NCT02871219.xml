  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well obinutuzumab and lenalidomide work in treating patients&#xD;
      with previously untreated stage II-IV grade 1-3a follicular lymphoma. Immunotherapy with&#xD;
      obinutuzumab, may induce changes in body's immune system and may interfere with the ability&#xD;
      of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as lenalidomide, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving obinutuzumab and lenalidomide&#xD;
      may work better in treating patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the efficacy of obinutuzumab combined with lenalidomide in patients with&#xD;
      previously untreated follicular lymphoma (FL) (determined by progression-free survival [PFS]&#xD;
      at 2 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety of obinutuzumab in combination with lenalidomide in patients with&#xD;
      untreated follicular lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the efficacy of obinutuzumab in combination with lenalidomide in subjects&#xD;
      with follicular lymphoma as assessed by complete remission (CR) at 30 months, overall&#xD;
      response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), event free survival (EFS), and overall&#xD;
      survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate prognostic and predictive biomarkers relative to treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive obinutuzumab intravenously (IV) over 4-6 hours on days 1, 8, and 15 of&#xD;
      course 1 and day 1 of courses 2-6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, and 30.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 30 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive lenalidomide orally (PO) on days 1-21. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with CR or complete remission unconfirmed (CRu) may receive&#xD;
      up to an additional 12 courses of lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 18 months&#xD;
      and then every year for up to 2 years.&#xD;
