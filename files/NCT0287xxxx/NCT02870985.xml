      The clinical investigation is a non-inferiority, multicenter, blinding evaluation,&#xD;
      randomized, parallel controlled clinical study enrolling up to 440 subjects. All subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized 1:1 to receive the BIOTRONIK Orsiro SES or the Abbott Xience Prime™ EES,&#xD;
      in order to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the SES drug eluting stent in the treatment&#xD;
      of coronary artery disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical or call follow up visits will take place at 1, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months post&#xD;
      procedure. At 9 months (+ 30 days) all subjects will undergo a standard quantitative coronary&#xD;
      angiography (QCA) follow up to assess the in-stent LLL as the main efficacious evaluation.&#xD;
      Use the major adverse cardiac event (death, myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis)&#xD;
      within one year post procedure as the main safety indicators to evaluate the investigational&#xD;
      product's safety. The clinical and angiographic data sorting, calculation and statistical&#xD;
      analysis will be conducted by an independent data management center and angiographic core&#xD;
      laboratory.&#xD;
