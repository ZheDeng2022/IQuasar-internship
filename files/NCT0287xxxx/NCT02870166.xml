    <textblock>
      Given the structural essential, catalytic and co-catalytic played by zinc in many sections of&#xD;
      protein metabolism, carbohydrate and lipid (zinc is involved in the function of more than 300&#xD;
      metalloenzymes and metalloproteins), one can imagine the impact of a deficiency or even a&#xD;
      sub-chronic zinc deficiency on the health of the individual. Studies multiply that show that,&#xD;
      long-term, marginal zinc deficiency is a risk factor for the development of cancer or&#xD;
      neurodegenerative complex diseases (eg Alzheimer's disease). In addition, the short-term zinc&#xD;
      deficiencies foster the development of skin conditions and susceptibility to viral and&#xD;
      bacterial infections. The aim of this project is to identify, in the population of patients&#xD;
      with pseudo-acrodermatitis enteropathica (AE) tested in the investigators laboratory, rare&#xD;
      variants (mutations &quot;real&quot; epimutations or polymorphisms) located in solute carrier family 39&#xD;
      member 4 (SLC39A4) gene or in 55 other genes chosen for their role in zinc homeostasis.&#xD;

        The investigators had therefore selected 96 individuals for the project. They correspond&#xD;
        either to the patients themselves (ie the index case tested in the laboratory) or to&#xD;
        mothers and / or fathers of patients who accompany their child consultation. For each of&#xD;
        them, the analysis will focus on the genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood&#xD;
        leukocytes and is stored in the sample bank of DNA laboratory. Note that twenty patients&#xD;
        seen by our collaborator neurologist, Prof. Vincent Ramaekers (Belgium) are a subgroup&#xD;
        separately in our study, since all have autistic disorders responsive to the zinc, in&#xD;
        addition to zinc deficiency. By studying these patients in particular clinical picture, we&#xD;
        already approach the possible consequences of zinc deficiency on complex diseases.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are included all patients (minors included) with suggestive symptoms and biological&#xD;
             signs of a hereditary deficiency of zinc, appeared for the first time at birth or&#xD;
             weaning (see description given in the introduction);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical diagnosis of zinc deficiency must be made by a specialist dermatologist,&#xD;
             pediatrician or gastroenterologist;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Zinc deficiency has been audited by an assay of serum zinc, erythrocyte, plasma, urine&#xD;
             or hair;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The response of all symptoms and signs to zinc oral supplementation should be rapid&#xD;
             and complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients with homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the SLC39A4 gene&#xD;
             are excluded because they have a proven acrodermatitis enteropathica (AE);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients who developed their first symptoms of zinc deficiency outside the&#xD;
             neonatal period, most likely because they have an acquired deficiency and not&#xD;
             congenital;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients with probable cause of zinc deficiency that is surgery of the digestive&#xD;
             tract, chronic digestive disease, or total parenteral nutrition.&#xD;
