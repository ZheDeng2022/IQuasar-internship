          -  Be willing to provide tissue from a newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a&#xD;
             tumor lesion. Newly-obtained is defined as a specimen obtained up to 6 weeks (42 days)&#xD;
             prior to initiation of treatment on Day 1. Subjects for whom newly-obtained samples&#xD;
             cannot be provided (e.g. inaccessible or subject safety concern) may submit an&#xD;
             archived specimen only upon agreement from the Sponsor.&#xD;

          -  Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG Performance Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined in Table 1, all screening labs should&#xD;
             be performed within 10 days of treatment initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum&#xD;
             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If&#xD;

             will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;

             control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course&#xD;
             of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication. Subjects of&#xD;
             childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not&#xD;
             been free from menses for more than 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with&#xD;
             the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study&#xD;
             of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational&#xD;
             device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any&#xD;
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to study&#xD;
             Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., equal and less than Grade 1 or at baseline) from&#xD;
             adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy&#xD;
             within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., equal and less&#xD;
             than Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered&#xD;
             agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Subjects with equal and less than Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to&#xD;
                  this criterion and may qualify for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from&#xD;
                  the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting&#xD;
                  therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.&#xD;
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous&#xD;
             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided&#xD;
             they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least eight weeks&#xD;
             prior to the first dose of trial treatment), have no evidence of new or enlarging&#xD;
             brain metastases, and are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial&#xD;
             treatment. This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded&#xD;

             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment.&#xD;

             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's&#xD;

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;

             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit&#xD;
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.&#xD;
