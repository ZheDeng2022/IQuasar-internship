  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common non-dermatologic malignancy in U.S. men. Transrectal&#xD;
      ultrasound (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsy is a commonly used diagnostic procedure for men with&#xD;
      an elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and/or abnormal digital rectal&#xD;
      examination (DRE). It is estimated that more than 1 million TRUS-guided prostate biopsies are&#xD;
      performed annually in the U.S. alone. However, a freehand TRUS-guided systematic biopsy (SB)&#xD;
      procedure has significant limitations. First, freehand biopsy cores are often spatially&#xD;
      clustered, rather than uniformly distributed, and do not accurately follow the recommended,&#xD;
      sextant template. Second, a freehand TRUS-guided biopsy does not allow precise mapping of the&#xD;
      biopsy cores within the prostate. Targeted biopsy (TB) using special devices emerged to help&#xD;
      the physicians guide the biopsy using multiparametric MRI (mpMRI). TB cores yield a higher&#xD;
      cancer detection rate of clinically significance PCa than SB cores, but TB cores also miss a&#xD;
      large number of clinically significant PCa that are detected by SB. Accordingly, TB is&#xD;
      commonly performed concurrently with SB (TB+SB procedure).&#xD;

      This study attempts to improve TRUS-guided prostate biopsy by utilizing assistance from a&#xD;
      novel robotic TRUS manipulator (TRUS-Robot) developed by our team. The hypothesis of the&#xD;
      study is that clinically significant prostate cancer detection rate from the SB cores (at SB&#xD;
      or TB+SB) can be improved above that of current devices. The objective of the study is to&#xD;
      gain early evidence on the effectiveness of prostate biopsy assisted by the TRUS-Robot vs. a&#xD;
      current TB device in a randomized clinical trial.&#xD;
