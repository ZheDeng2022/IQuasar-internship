    <textblock>
      Vitamin K2 deficiency has been shown to be profound in hemodialysis patients. It is reflected&#xD;
      by high plasma levels of dephosphorylated-undercarboxylated Matrix Gla protein (dp-ucMGP) and&#xD;
      seems to be correlated with vascular calcifications. Vascular calcifications can be assessed&#xD;
      using the AC24 score on a lateral abdominal X-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess first the rate of decrease of dp-ucMGP in a hemodialysis&#xD;
      cohort after supplementation with vitamin K2 and the correlation between this rate of&#xD;
      decrease and the Aortic Calcification Severity (AC24) score. The factors associated with high&#xD;
      levels of dp-ucMGP will be analyzed as well.&#xD;

      Background The majority of patients reaching end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and dialysis have&#xD;
      vascular calcifications. Those vascular calcifications tend to increase mortality in this&#xD;
      specific population. It has been shown that high scores of vascular calcifications in a&#xD;
      healthy patient with no cardiovascular risk factors lead to a higher mortality rate compared&#xD;
      with someone with ≥3 risk factors without calcification. In hemodialysis (HD) patients,&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors are numerous and they include the traditional ones such as age,&#xD;
      smoking, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and those specific to chronic kidney disease&#xD;
      (CKD) as for instance hyperparathyroidism. All those facts are compelling arguments to look&#xD;
      seriously for a treatment against vascular calcifications. Therefore the 2009 Kidney disease:&#xD;
      Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis, Evaluation,&#xD;
      Prevention, and Treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral and Bone Disorder (CKD-MBD) has&#xD;
      suggested to measure those vascular calcifications scores by a lateral abdominal radiograph&#xD;
      that is a cost-effective alternative to the standard computed tomography-based imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to lower or prevent vascular calcifications in chronic kidney disease (CKD)&#xD;
      patients, many interventions have been studied in the past. They have included treatments&#xD;
      such as statins, non-calcium-based phosphate binders and cinacalcet. So far, the&#xD;
      non-calcium-based phosphate binders showed significant benefit on mortality but none of the&#xD;
      studies manifested a solid beneficial effect on vascular calcifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last years, remarkable data emerged concerning the association between vascular&#xD;
      calcifications and plasmatic levels of dephosphorylated-undercarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP).&#xD;
      dp-ucMGP is the inactive form of Matrix gla protein (MGP). MGP is a small protein known to&#xD;
      act locally in the tissues as a calcification inhibitor and it is vitamin K dependent. High&#xD;
      dp-ucMGP levels reflect low activity of MGP. Vitamin K2 deficiency is one of the factors that&#xD;
      increase dp-ucMGP. There have been several reports also showing that dp-ucMGP levels increase&#xD;
      gradually after the age of 40 and are significantly higher in those older than 65, in&#xD;
      patients with diabetes, aortic stenosis, heart failure and on vitamin K antagonists (VKA).&#xD;
      They are also extremely high in ESRD patients on dialysis. Moreover the combination of VKA&#xD;
      and dialysis increases the incidence of calciphylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since high dp-ucMGP levels suggest vitamin k2 deficiency and are associated with vascular&#xD;
      calcification, supplementing high-risk patients especially CKD patients with vitamin k2&#xD;
      (menaquinone) seems very promising. Vitamin k2 can be provided to the patient as a pill or&#xD;
      through a specific food diet. Food that seems to affect dp-ucMGP levels includes natto and&#xD;
      fermented cheese such as camembert, goat cheese or gouda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin K2 supplementation was analyzed in several European HD cohorts. In 2012, Westenfeld&#xD;
      et al. demonstrated that vitamin k2 supplements in hemodialysis patients lead to a&#xD;
      dose-dependent decrease in plasma dp-ucMGP levels. This was reproduced by Caluwé at al in&#xD;
      2014 and they both showed that a dose of 360 μg /d lower the dp-ucMGP by 30-33%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies in patients with normal renal function showed a higher decrease of dp-ucMGP ~50%&#xD;
      under 180 μg /d of menaquinone and this could be explained in many ways. Either vitamin K2&#xD;
      deficiency is very profound in CKD and particularly dialysis patients or dp-ucMGP does not&#xD;
      only reflect vitamin k2 deficiency in those patients. High dp-ucMGP could be associated with&#xD;
      other risk factors for calcifications in chronic kidney disease such as phosphate, calcium or&#xD;
      parathyroid hormone (PTH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Middle-Eastern diet is different from European countries and MGP activity as well as vitamin&#xD;
      K2 supplementation have not yet been studied in dialysis populations in this part of the&#xD;
      world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore this study will be conducted in a Lebanese hemodialysis center where patients will&#xD;
      receive vitamin k2 for 4 weeks. The investigators will assess first the rate of decrease of&#xD;
      dp-ucMGP after supplementation with vitamin K2 and the correlation between this rate of&#xD;
      decrease and the AC24 score. They will analyze as well the factors associated with high&#xD;
      levels of dp-ucMGP. Finally they will define the rate of decrease of dp-ucMGP after VKA&#xD;
      withdrawal in a small subgroup before including them in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design, participants and data collection This is a prospective, pre-post intervention&#xD;
      clinical trial. All patients in a single dialysis center older than 18 years on chronic&#xD;
      hemodialysis since more than one month will be included. Patients who are taking VKA and can&#xD;
      not stop it (heart valve replacement cases) will be excluded. The total expected trial&#xD;
      duration is 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data for demographics, comorbidities, medications and laboratory results are collected from&#xD;
      the patients' medical records. Variables that will be studied are: age, gender, months on&#xD;
      dialysis, residual diuresis, BMI, urea reduction ratio (URR), diabetes, hypertension,&#xD;
      smoking, hyperlipidemia, calcium and non-calcium-based phosphate binders, cinacalcet,&#xD;
      alfacalcidol, AC-24 score, dp-ucMGP level, albumin, coronary artery disease, mean of calcium,&#xD;
      phosphorus and parathyroid hormone (PTH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calcium, phosphorus, PTH, LDL cholesterol and serum albumin levels will be collected from the&#xD;
      medical record of the patient. Calcium and phosphorus are measured monthly on a routine&#xD;
      basis; the mean of the last 12 measurements will be calculated. PTH is measured every 4-6&#xD;
      months; all PTH levels of each patient will be collected since the start of dialysis in order&#xD;
      to obtain the mean PTH level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions Coronary artery disease is defined as a history of coronary artery disease&#xD;
      treated medically or interventionally. Diabetes and hypertension are defined as taking&#xD;
      antidiabetic treatment or antihypertensive treatment respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal phosphate and calcium are defined respectively as 3.5-4.5 mg/dL and 8.4-9.5 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-calcium phosphate binders available are sevelamer and lanthanum. The only active vitamin&#xD;
      D that patients will take is alfacalcidol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations The study is approved by the ethical committee of the Saint-Joseph&#xD;
      University-Beirut and complies with the Declaration of Helsinki of 1975. All patients have to&#xD;
      give written informed consent to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The supplementation with vitamin K2 does not put the patient at risk of hypercoagulability&#xD;
      and a previous prospective cohort of 35000 healthy subjects supplemented with vitamin K&#xD;
      showed no increase in ischemic stroke events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be eligible for the trial if they sign the informed consent. All patients will&#xD;
      receive 360 μg of menaquinone once daily. Menaquinone will be provided by Omicron, Lebanon.&#xD;
      The chosen dose in this trial was established from two previous trials done on hemodialysis&#xD;
      patients. A daily dose of 360 μg Menaquinone reduces the amount of inactive MGP by 30-33% in&#xD;
      hemodialysis patients. The dose of the day of dialysis will be given in the center to ensure&#xD;
      at least the compliance towards the half of the dose per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting the trial, patients on vitamin k antagonists as a prevention for vascular&#xD;
      access thrombosis will withdraw the VKA and be included in the study after stabilization of&#xD;
      their dp-ucMGP levels. The investigators will assess the average time necessary to reach a&#xD;
      stable level of dp-ucMGP after VKA withdrawal. Patients will be assigned to receive 360 μg of&#xD;
      menaquinone once daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of dp-ucMGP and AC-24 score measurements dp-ucMGP will be measured twice, once&#xD;
      before the vitamin k2 supplementation and second after four weeks of the treatment.&#xD;
      Pre-dialysis venous blood samples will be processed to the same laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Circulating dp-ucMGP will be quantified using a dual antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent&#xD;
      assay provided by Immunodiagnostic Systems Ltd, United Kingdom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lateral abdominal X-ray of the lumbar aorta will be performed at the inclusion of the study.&#xD;
      For each patient the abdominal aortic calcifications will be estimated using the Aortic&#xD;
      Calcification Severity (AC-24) score. The AC-24 score will be calculated by two independent&#xD;
      physicians. If the difference is one point, the higher score will be recorded. If the&#xD;
      difference is more than one point a third opinion will be sought and the mean of the three&#xD;
      levels will be retained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data and Follow-up Patients will have their pre-dialysis blood pressure measured&#xD;
      after 15 min of rest and recorded at the beginning and the end of the study using validated&#xD;
      automated electronic monitors. Their blood pressure levels will be checked also during the 4&#xD;
      weeks period three times per week in the dialysis center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of adverse events Patients will be evaluated for any side-effect at each dialysis&#xD;
      session, especially regarding their vascular access patency or other thrombotic event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics will be used to represent important variables of&#xD;
      known risk factors, exposures and treatment options. Continuous variables that are normally&#xD;
      distributed will be presented as means and standard deviation. Otherwise median and range&#xD;
      will be the appropriate method. Student t test and one way ANOVA will be used for parametric&#xD;
      variables comparison and Mann Whitney U and Kruskal Wallis for non parametric variables.&#xD;
      Categorical variables will be presented by count and percentage. Χ2 fischer exact test and&#xD;
      logistic regression will be used to compare two or more categorical variables respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pearson correlation will be calculated to investigate the association of vascular&#xD;
      calcifications score with dp-ucMGP level as well as with potential covariates. A stepwise&#xD;
      multivariable linear regression will be employed to adjust for the association of MGP with&#xD;
      calcification score in the presence of significant covariates. P &lt; 0.20 will be considered&#xD;
      valid for inclusion in the model. A 2-sided P &lt; 0.05 will be considered significant. To&#xD;
      determine the effect of vitamin K2 intake on dp-ucMGP, the pre- and post-levels will be&#xD;
      compared using matched t-test. All analyses will be done using SPSS statistics (22.0 version,&#xD;
      SPSS Inc, Chicago, III).&#xD;
