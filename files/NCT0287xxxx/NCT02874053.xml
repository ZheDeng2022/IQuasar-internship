      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with cancer often have to make complex decisions about their treatment. For some of&#xD;
      these decisions, they have to weigh the benefits of a treatment against its side effects.&#xD;
      They may have to think about its potential to increase the risk of another disease. One&#xD;
      example is hormone replacement therapy. That reduces a woman s risk of getting colorectal&#xD;
      cancer, but it raises her risk of getting breast cancer. Researchers want to learn more about&#xD;
      how people make tradeoff decisions like these.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn about how people respond to information about hypothetical health and medical&#xD;
      treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 70.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have one 30-minute visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a series of short questionnaires. These will be about their&#xD;
      beliefs and values. Some may be about cancer and heart disease risk. Participants ages 18 to&#xD;
      29 will answer questions about sexual health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will write a paragraph or two about a room in their house or about a life event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will read a series of stories. These will describe different hypothetical health&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stories describe a pill that lowers the risk of one health condition, but raises the risk&#xD;
      for another. After each story, participants will note how willing they are to take the pill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will answer questions about the information that they got. They will also answer&#xD;
      questions about their health, beliefs, and opinions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will do 2 attention tasks computer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given that many preventive and therapeutic treatments for cancer lower the risk of one&#xD;
      disease, but increase the risk of another disease (or have substantial side effects),&#xD;
      patients and doctors often must make medical decisions that involve tradeoffs. When faced&#xD;
      with these tradeoffs, people make decisions based on factors beyond objective probability&#xD;
      estimates. Emotions and regulatory focus are known to influence judgment and risk propensity&#xD;
      in non-tradeoff decision-making contexts, but little is known about their independent and&#xD;
      joint effects on decision making in tradeoff scenarios where both options involve some degree&#xD;
      of risk. This study aims to generate fundamental knowledge about how individuals make&#xD;
      decisions in the context of these tradeoffs, and whether individuals with clinical disorders&#xD;
      or at risk for clinical disorders differ from healthy individuals in their decision making.&#xD;
      This will have immediate translational potential for applied studies of decision making among&#xD;
      cancer patients and those at increased risk for cancer. We plan to examine the effects of&#xD;
      discrete incidental affect on tradeoff decision making, and the role of regulatory focus as a&#xD;
      moderator of its effect. During visits to a laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh, human&#xD;
      subjects aged 18 to 70 will be randomly assigned to write about an emotional event (something&#xD;
      that made them angry or afraid depending on study condition) or about a room in their house&#xD;
      (neutral emotion condition). Then, they will read a series of scenarios that describe a pill&#xD;
      that lowers their risk of one health condition, but raises their risk for another. After&#xD;
      each, they will indicate their willingness to take the pill. Regulatory focus, risk&#xD;
      perceptions, and implicit measures of risk propensity and anticipated emotions will also be&#xD;
      assessed. Drawing on previous research, we hypothesize that participants asked to recall an&#xD;
      angry experience will be more willing to take the pill, and that this effect will be&#xD;
      particularly strong for those with a promotion-oriented regulatory focus. Prevention-focused&#xD;
      participants asked to recall an experience that made them feel afraid are expected to be&#xD;
      least willing to take the pill. We will also explore possible mechanisms underlying the&#xD;
      emotion induction s effect on pill choice, such as shifts in risk perceptions, biased&#xD;
      attentional focus, and implicitly measured anticipated emotions.&#xD;
