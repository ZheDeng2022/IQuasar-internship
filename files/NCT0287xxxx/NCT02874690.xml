      The overall goal of this research is to use neurophysiological measures to profile strengths&#xD;
      and deficits for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder co-morbidity in Autism Spectrum&#xD;
      Disorder to clarify diagnosis and to predict treatment response.&#xD;

      The project &quot;Eye Tracking as a Predictor of Methylphenidate (MPH) Response in Low Functioning&#xD;
      Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) with comorbid ADHD&quot; will investigate the role of a&#xD;
      non-invasive neurophysiological biomarker in an underserved population to clarify diagnosis&#xD;
      and guide treatment decisions. Specifically, we will modify an existing eye tracking paradigm&#xD;
      that discriminates between ADHD and typical youth, for use in an ASD cohort with (ASD+) and&#xD;
      without an ADHD comorbidity. A case-control design (Aim 1) will lead into a randomized&#xD;
      placebo controlled trial of MPH in children with ASD with comorbid ADHD (Aim 2). We&#xD;
      hypothesize that children with ASD+ will demonstrate specific abnormalities in microsaccades,&#xD;
      eye blink frequency, and pupil dilatation on continuous performance testing that will predict&#xD;
      MPH treatment response on standardized clinical outcomes for ADHD. As a secondary measure, we&#xD;
      will also perform a brief electrophysiological measure, short interval cortical inhibition&#xD;
      (SICI), as measured by paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). We have&#xD;
      extensively investigated this measure as a robust predictor of ADHD diagnosis and symptom&#xD;
      severity in ADHD and typical youth. We anticipate this personalized medicine-based approach&#xD;
      to clarify ADHD co-occurrence in ASD will result in a novel neurophysiological biomarker will&#xD;
      enhance diagnostic reliability and better match appropriate pharmacotherapy in a highly&#xD;
      complex neurodevelopmental disease.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 5 (DSM-V) diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder&#xD;
             (ASD) not otherwise specified (NOS) based on a semi-structured review of Diagnostic&#xD;
             and Statistical Manual 5 (DSM-V) criteria and mental status examination as well as a a&#xD;
             complete systematic patient interview utilizing the Autism Diagnostic Observation&#xD;
             Schedule (ADOS)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males and females ages 8-21 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must not be taking any psychotropic drugs affecting glutamate&#xD;
             neurotransmission (riluzole, memantine, acamprosate, topiramate, amantadine, among&#xD;
             others) which may interfere with TMS recording. If patient is on a home&#xD;
             psychostimulants medication this will be held on the day of testing. Subjects may not&#xD;
             be taking more than two psychotropic drugs. Dosing of all concomitant psychotropic&#xD;
             drugs targeting core social and/or communication impairment must be stable for four&#xD;
             weeks prior to randomization. Dosing of all concomitant psychotropic drugs targeting&#xD;
             other features associated with ASD (insomnia, inattention, hyperactivity, anxiety,&#xD;
             irritability among others) must be stable for two weeks (with the exception of four&#xD;
             weeks for fluoxetine) prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stable seizure disorder (no seizures in 6 months prior to enrollment; on same&#xD;
             anticonvulsant dose &gt; 60 days or )&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to participate in neurophysiological testing including Electroencephalogram (EEG)&#xD;
             and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) portions of the experiment based on&#xD;
             patient comfort and examiner judgement&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Legal guardian has provided written informed consent and the subject has provided&#xD;
             written informed assent. Expectation that a majority of subjects will be able to&#xD;
             assent but the potential for the younger children and/or those that are cognitively&#xD;
             impaired will not be able to assent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects exhibiting significant disruptive, aggressive, self-injurious, or sexually&#xD;
             inappropriate behavior will not be eligible for enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 5 (DSM-V) psychiatric disorders&#xD;
             that may require alternative pharmacotherapy or different treatment including&#xD;
             psychotic disorders, major affective disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic&#xD;
             disorder, or substance related disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of any medical condition that would make treatment with methylphenidate (MPH)&#xD;
             less safe. Subjects with significant cardiac, hepatic, or renal disease will be&#xD;
             excluded due to concerns about pharmacokinetic alterations or adverse effects. Because&#xD;
             of the unknown effects of methylphenidate (MPH) on the developing human fetus, females&#xD;
             of childbearing potential will be given a urine pregnancy test and required to use a&#xD;
             suitable form of birth control during the study. A positive pregnancy test result&#xD;
             excludes the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of any other condition that would make the participants unable to comply with&#xD;
             the requirements of the study for any reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prohibited Concomitant Medications: Methylphenidate is primarily excreted by the&#xD;
             kidneys and has few known pharmacokinetic drug interactions. The following medications&#xD;
             are not allowed due to the potential for a pharmacodynamic interaction: monoamine&#xD;
             oxidase inhibitors or atomoxetine.&#xD;
