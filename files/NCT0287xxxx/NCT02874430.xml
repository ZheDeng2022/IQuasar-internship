    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well metformin hydrochloride works together with doxycycline&#xD;
      in treating patients with localized breast or uterine cancer. Metformin hydrochloride may&#xD;
      stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;
      Doxycycline may stop the growth of bacteria by keeping them from making proteins and&#xD;
      minimized the toxic side effects of anti-cancer therapy. It is not yet known whether giving&#xD;
      metformin hydrochloride together with doxycycline may be a better way in treating patients&#xD;
      with localized breast or uterine cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if treatment with a combination of metformin and doxycycline can increase the&#xD;
      percentage of cells that express Caveolin-1 in the cancer associated fibroblasts of patients&#xD;
      with breast, or uterine, and cervical cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the effect of metformin and doxycycline treatment on the percentage of cells&#xD;
      that express monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)4 in cancer associated fibroblasts and MCT1 and&#xD;
      transporter of outer mitochondrial membrane (TOMM)20 in the cancer cells of breast and&#xD;
      uterine cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess safety and tolerability of metformin and doxycycline treatment in subjects with&#xD;
      breast and uterine cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the relationship of the percentage of stromal cells expressing caveolin&#xD;
      (CAV)1 or MCT4 and tumor cells that express MCT1 and TOMM20 at baseline and after treatment&#xD;
      with metformin and doxycycline with the percentage of cells expressing estrogen receptor (ER)&#xD;
      and progesterone receptor (PR) for breast and uterine samples and human epidermal growth&#xD;
      factor (HER)2 in breast cancer samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the effect of combined metformin and doxycycline therapy on the metabolic&#xD;
      profile of cancer cells and stroma using mass spectroscopy imaging (MSI) on paired samples,&#xD;
      comparing metabolite profiles in the pre-metformin and post-metformin tumor sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess, when possible, the impact of a patient's nutritional status, estimated using 3&#xD;
      day dietary recall versus caloric needs as calculated by the Harris-Benedict equation on the&#xD;
      baseline and net change in CAV1 III. To assess the effect of combined metformin and&#xD;
      doxycycline therapy on oncomiR micro ribonucleic acid (RNA) (miR-21) after intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess the effect of combined metformin and doxycycline therapy on adipokines and the&#xD;
      insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1/insulin signaling pathways through assessment of serum&#xD;
      triglycerides, IGF-1, IGF-binding protein (BP)3, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR),&#xD;
      adiponectin, leptin, IGF-1 receptor (R), exosome evaluation, metabolomics profile, and&#xD;
      microRNA expression profile.&#xD;
