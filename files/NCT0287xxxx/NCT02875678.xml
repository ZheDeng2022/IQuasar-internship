      A Single-Dose Study to Evaluate the Effects of ABX-1431 on Gastric Accommodation and Nutrient&#xD;
      Volume Tolerance in Patients with Functional Dyspepsia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single dose, randomized, placebo-controlled, two period crossover study. This study&#xD;
      will assess the effects of ABX-1431 on gastric physiology in patients with functional&#xD;
      dyspepsia, who have clinical evidence of impaired gastric accommodation with meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo a screening visit for enrollment criteria. Eligible patients will&#xD;
      be treated with a single dose of ABX-1431 HCl or placebo followed by IGP measurement,&#xD;
      measured with a high resolution manometry probe during a nutrient volume tolerance test.&#xD;
      After a washout period of at least one week, patients will undergo identical procedures with&#xD;
      the other treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll 12 functional dyspepsia (FD) patients.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has functional dyspepsia, postprandial distress syndrome (PDS) subtype,&#xD;
             defined by the Rome III criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has evidence of impaired gastric accommodation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient's Rome III Questionnaire results indicates that the intensity of co-existing&#xD;
             epigastric pain and/or epigastric burning may be present, but have the same or lesser&#xD;
             intensity than the evaluations of postprandial fullness or early satiety (i.e.&#xD;
             epigastric pain and burning are not the prominent symptoms of the patient's functional&#xD;
             dyspepsia).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient recall of symptoms of gastrointestinal reflux over the past 8 weeks has no&#xD;
             more than 2 episodes per week of heartburn or regurgitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is a male or female between 18 and 65 years of age at the pre-study/screening&#xD;
             visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt;18 to ≤30 kg/m2 at the pre-study/screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is judged to have no unmanaged significant disease or disorder based on&#xD;
             medical history, physical examination, vital sign measurements, and laboratory safety&#xD;
             obtained at pre-study/screening, and within 36 hours prior to first administration of&#xD;
             study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has no clinically significant abnormality of ECG performed at pre&#xD;
             study/screening, and prior to first administration of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is willing to undergo the nutrient volume tolerance tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

             enrolled at the discretion of the Investigator. Patients who are taking gabapentin or&#xD;
             pregabalin or buspirone are also excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is mentally or legally incapacitated, has significant emotional problems at&#xD;
             the time of pre-study/screening visit or is expected to have potential for mental&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patient has had any gastrointestinal surgery. Those having undergone a simple&#xD;

             calculation. Patients with an actual or calculated creatinine clearance that is in the&#xD;
             range of 72-79 mL/min (i.e., within 10% of 80 mL/min) may be enrolled in the study at&#xD;
