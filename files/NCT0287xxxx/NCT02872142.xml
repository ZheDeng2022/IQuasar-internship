    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, prospective, open-label, single-arm pilot study to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of PE with Albutein® 5% in participants with ALS. The planned enrollment is 10&#xD;
      participants who have a definite, possible, or probable diagnosis of ALS, according to the&#xD;
      revised El Escorial criteria. Enrolled participants will be treated with PE using Albutein 5%&#xD;
      as a replacement solution during an Intensive Treatment Phase (2 PEs per week over 3 weeks)&#xD;
      followed by a Maintenance Treatment Phase (weekly PE for 21 weeks) for a total treatment&#xD;
      duration of 6 months. A 6-month follow up will begin after the last PE.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0), Weeks 4, 12, 25, 36, and 48</time_frame>
    <description>The ALSFRS-R includes 12 questions to assess the self-sufficiency of participants in 3 sub-domains: bulbar function (questions 1-3), fine and gross motor function (questions 4-9), and respiratory function (question 10-12). Aspects of nourishment, personal care, personal autonomy, and communication were also evaluated. Each task was graded on a five-point scale from 0 (incapable) to 4 (normal ability), with total score range from 0 (worst) to 48 (best). A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Cognitive Function as Assessed by Behaviour Status Sub-scale Score of the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis - Cognitive Behavioural Screen (ALS-CBS) Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0), Weeks 25, and 48</time_frame>
    <description>ALS-CBS test is composed of two sections: the cognitive screening section and behavioural changes section. The section of behavioural changes consists of behaviour status and symptom status sub-scales. Behaviour status sub-scale consists of a questionnaire with 15 items assessed by the caretaker. Each item was scored on a scale ranging from 0 (worst) to 3 (best) yielding a total 0= large changes to 45= no changes. A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Cognitive Function as Assessed by Symptom Status Sub-scale Score of the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis - Cognitive Behavioral Screen (ALS-CBS) Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0), Weeks 25, and 48</time_frame>
    <description>ALS-CBS test is composed of two sections: cognitive screening section and behavioural changes section. The section of behavioural changes consists of behaviour status and symptom status sub-scales. Cognitive function assessed by symptom status sub-scale is reported, which consists of 4 additional questions related to current behavioural symptoms (depression, anxiety, fatigue, and emotional liability). Each question was scored as 0= the presence of symptoms and 1= no current symptoms, giving a total subscale score between 0 and 4. A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Cognitive Function as Assessed by Cognitive Screening Section Score of the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis - Cognitive Behavioral Screen (ALS-CBS) Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0), Weeks 25, and 48</time_frame>
    <description>ALS-CBS test is composed of two sections: cognitive screening section and behavioural changes section. Cognitive function is evaluated using cognitive screening section which consists of: attention (complex orders, mental sums, language, and eye movement); concentration (inversion of numeric series); follow-up and monitoring (reverse sequences, alphabet, number and letter sequencing); and initiation and recovery (nomination). The individual items were scored from 0-5, and the total score ranges from 0-20, where 0= cognitive impairment, 20= no apparent cognitive impairment. A positive change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of Quality of Life Using the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Assessment Questionnaire 40 (ALSA-Q40) Test Dimension Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 25 and 48</time_frame>
    <description>The ALS questionnaire consists of 40 items grouped into 5 representative dimensions associated with quality of life. The first four dimensions were: physical mobility (questions 1-10), activities of daily living (questions 11- 20), food and drink (questions 21-23), communication (questions 24-30) and emotional function (questions 31-40), refer to deficits and subsequent disabilities as a result of the disease. The fifth scale (emotional functioning) reflects how the participant is facing his/her physical deterioration emotionally. Each item is scored from 0 to 4 according to a gradation of symptom onset frequency (never, rarely, sometimes, often, always). From raw scores, an index from 0 to 100 is obtained for each dimension, which make comparisons with the other dimensions possible as well as a straightforward interpretation of the results (0 = better state of health as measured by the questionnaire;100 = poorer state of health). A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

          <description>The FVC measured the volume of air that can forcibly be exhaled through a spirometer after a full inspiration. It was expressed in a percentage of actual FVC over the expected FVC result in the general population, calculated as: Percent predicted FVC (in %) = [(observed FVC in liters)/(predicted FVC in liters)]*100.</description>
          <population>Evaluable Population included all participants who received at least one PE treatment with albutein 5% and also had at least one baseline determination and a measurement of a primary efficacy variable at a subsequent visit. Number analyzed is the number of participants with data available for analyses at the given time point.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Cognitive Function as Assessed by Cognitive Screening Section Score of the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis - Cognitive Behavioral Screen (ALS-CBS) Test</title>
        <description>ALS-CBS test is composed of two sections: cognitive screening section and behavioural changes section. Cognitive function is evaluated using cognitive screening section which consists of: attention (complex orders, mental sums, language, and eye movement); concentration (inversion of numeric series); follow-up and monitoring (reverse sequences, alphabet, number and letter sequencing); and initiation and recovery (nomination).

          <title>Change From Baseline in Cognitive Function as Assessed by Cognitive Screening Section Score of the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis - Cognitive Behavioral Screen (ALS-CBS) Test</title>
          <description>ALS-CBS test is composed of two sections: cognitive screening section and behavioural changes section. Cognitive function is evaluated using cognitive screening section which consists of: attention (complex orders, mental sums, language, and eye movement); concentration (inversion of numeric series); follow-up and monitoring (reverse sequences, alphabet, number and letter sequencing); and initiation and recovery (nomination). The individual items were scored from 0-5, and the total score ranges from 0-20, where 0= cognitive impairment, 20= no apparent cognitive impairment. A positive change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Evaluation of Quality of Life Using the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Assessment Questionnaire 40 (ALSA-Q40) Test Dimension Score</title>
        <description>The ALS questionnaire consists of 40 items grouped into 5 representative dimensions associated with quality of life. The first four dimensions were: physical mobility (questions 1-10), activities of daily living (questions 11- 20), food and drink (questions 21-23), communication (questions 24-30) and emotional function (questions 31-40), refer to deficits and subsequent disabilities as a result of the disease. The fifth scale (emotional functioning) reflects how the participant is facing his/her physical deterioration emotionally. Each item is scored from 0 to 4 according to a gradation of symptom onset frequency (never, rarely, sometimes, often, always). From raw scores, an index from 0 to 100 is obtained for each dimension, which make comparisons with the other dimensions possible as well as a straightforward interpretation of the results (0 = better state of health as measured by the questionnaire;100 = poorer state of health). A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <population>Evaluable Population included all participants who received at least one PE treatment with albutein 5% and also had at least one baseline determination and a measurement of a primary efficacy variable at a subsequent visit.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Plasma Cytokine Panel Levels</title>
        <description>The plasma cytokine panel includes: transforming growth factor (TGF) beta1, TGF beta2, TGF beta3, interferon (IFN) gamma, interleukins (IL)-1beta, IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 p70, IL-17A, IFN-γ-inducible protein (IP)-10, human monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1-alpha, MIP-1-beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, soluble cluster of differentiation (CD) 40 ligand (sCD40L), fractalkine. The level of each of these cytokines are reported as categories. Only categories with values above the level of detection are reported.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0), before and after PE procedure at Weeks 4, 12, 24, and before PE for Weeks 36 and 48</time_frame>
        <population>Evaluable Population included all participants who received at least one PE treatment with albutein 5% and also had at least one baseline determination and measurement of a primary efficacy variable at a subsequent visit. Number analyzed is the number of participants with detectable values for the analyses of the specific category at the given time point.</population>

            <description>PEs with albutein 5% as a replacement solution during an intensive treatment phase of two PEs per week over 3 weeks followed by maintenance treatment phase of weekly PE for 21 weeks. The dose of albutein 5% for replacement following plasma removal was calculated based on gender, weight, and the hematocrit of the participant.</description>

        <description>The CSF cytokine panel includes: TGF beta1, TGF beta2, TGF beta3, IFN gamma, IL-1beta, IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 p70, IL-17A, IP-10, MCP-1, MDC, MIP-1 alpha, MIP-1 beta, TNF alpha, sCD40L, fractalkine. The level of each of these cytokines are reported as categories. Only categories with values above the level of detection are reported.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0), Weeks 12, and 25</time_frame>
        <population>Evaluable Population included all participants who received at least one PE treatment with albutein 5% and also had at least one baseline determination and measurement of a primary efficacy variable at a subsequent visit. Number analyzed is the number of participants with detectable values for the analyses of the specific category at the given time point.</population>
