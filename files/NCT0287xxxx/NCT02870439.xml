      Burn injury with full-thickness skin damage that encompass large body surface areas can&#xD;
      induce local and systemic perturbations that are costly in terms of human suffering as well&#xD;
      as in strains on the health care system. Characterization of new major molecular biomarkers&#xD;
      involved in this process creates significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 α (HIF-1 α) is a ubiquitously expressed heterodimeric&#xD;
      transcription factor comprising an α and a β subunit. It was shown that under normoxic&#xD;
      conditions, the HIF-1α subunit is ubiquitinated and degraded, whereas under hypoxic&#xD;
      conditions, HIF-1α accumulates, dimerizes with HIF-1β, and activates the transcription of a&#xD;
      spectrum of target genes encoding multiple angiogenic growth factors and cytokines of&#xD;
      potential importance in wound healing. Seven isoforms of HIF-1α issued from alternative&#xD;
      splicing have been identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of HIF-1α in wound healing in animal models has been suggested by several&#xD;
      studies. Indeed, diminished HIF-1 levels and activity have been documented in conditions of&#xD;
      impaired wound healing. The literature review shows a marked reduction of HIF-1α levels in&#xD;
      mice in case of burn wound skin that in the case of excisional cutaneous wound. Other studies&#xD;
      have shown that the expression of HIF-1α was correlated with the extent and depth of the&#xD;
      burns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to improve the knowledge on the pathophysiological factors involved in the&#xD;
      field of wound healing. The assumptions are based on results of studies done on mice, and&#xD;
      this work aims to document these findings in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to compare the variations of expression of HIF-1α measured&#xD;
      in blood and skin tissue samples in three groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects with major burn wounds involving more than 20% of the total body surface area;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects with burn wounds smaller than 5% of total body surface area;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects with a skin wound after a surgical procedure requiring a skin resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to compare the expression levels of HIF-1α locally at the burn site&#xD;
      to those observed in blood, to evaluate the expression of growth factors produced by HIF-1α&#xD;
      target genes (VEGF and EPO) or playing a central role in the healing process (TGF-β1), and to&#xD;
      assess the correlation between the expression of HIF-1α and the kinetics of wound healing of&#xD;
      the subject rated by evaluation of time of donor sites complete epithelialization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to create three groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  15 patients with extensive third degree burns involving more than 20% of the total body&#xD;
           surface area;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  15 patients with less extensive third degree burns, involving less than 5% of body&#xD;
           surface area;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  15 patients with post-surgical wounds with skin resection. Skin and tissue specimens&#xD;
           will be collected three times: day 0, 7 and 14 from burned patients (with more than 20%&#xD;
           of the total body surface area and less than 5% of body surface area). Samples of skin&#xD;
           tissue will be collected within the skin resection from patients with post-surgical&#xD;
           wounds at day 0, blood samples will be collected at day 0 and 14.&#xD;
