      This research study is studying Ruxolitinib as possible treatment for Inflammatory Breast&#xD;
      Cancer (IBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Following drugs will be use in combination with Ruxolinitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Paclitaxel (also called Taxol)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Doxorubicin also called Adriamycin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cyclophosphamide, also called Cytoxan&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness&#xD;
      of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Ruxolitinib for Inflammatory&#xD;
      Breast Cancer (IBC), but is has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ruxolitinib is a newly discovered drug that has been shown to block a pathway (called the&#xD;
      IL6/JAK/Stat pathway) that may be important in cancer, including triple negative inflammatory&#xD;
      breast cancer. Ruxolitinib brings proteins groups together, which can result in gene (DNA)&#xD;
      changes. These DNA changes may stop cancer cells from growing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paclitaxel (also called Taxol), Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide (also called Adriamycin and&#xD;
      Cytoxan, (&quot;AC&quot;)) are drugs FDA approved for breast cancer patients. They have been shown to&#xD;
      result in death of cancer cells when given as preoperative treatment of women with&#xD;
      inflammatory breast cancer (IBC). Laboratory studies have shown that Ruxolitinib may make&#xD;
      Paclitaxel more effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are evaluating Ruxolitinib in combination with&#xD;
      Paclitaxel followed by the standard chemotherapy, AC. Researchers will also evaluate how the&#xD;
      IL6/JAK/Stat pathway is affected by this combination of drugs by studying biopsies and&#xD;
      surgical specimens.&#xD;

             subtypes are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have known ER, PR, and HER2 status defined as triple-negative breast&#xD;
             cancer (TNBC), defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
             --ER and PR &lt;10% by immunohistochemistry, and HER2-negative ( as per ASCO/CAP&#xD;

             intact breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the&#xD;
             use of ruxolitinib in participants &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with evidence of extensive nodal involvement are allowed. Extensive nodal&#xD;
             involvement is defined as metastatic disease involving any nodal region outside of the&#xD;
             involved breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with minimal metastatic disease involvement in bone or viscera are allowed.&#xD;
             Minimal metastatic disease is defined as: evidence of metastatic involvement as&#xD;
             demonstrated by imaging only, not amenable to biopsy confirmation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Both men and women are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of ruxolitinib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason&#xD;
             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry until&#xD;
             completion of chemotherapy. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant&#xD;
             while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  LVEF &gt; 50% calculated by echocardiogram (ECHO) or MUGA&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have bilateral breast cancer so long as one breast meets criteria for&#xD;
             inflammatory breast cancer, and neither breast cancer has received prior therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants may not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to ruxolitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants receiving any medications or substances that are potent inhibitors of&#xD;
             CYP3A4, including grapefruit juice are ineligible. Participants receiving fluconazole&#xD;
             are also ineligible. (Please refer to Appendix B for the full list of potent&#xD;
             inhibitors and washout periods).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic corticosteroid use in excess of the equivalent of prednisone 10 mg once daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and&#xD;
             cyclophosphamide have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because&#xD;
             there is an unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary&#xD;
             to treatment of the mother with these agents, breastfeeding should be discontinued if&#xD;
             the mother is treated on study. These potential risks may also apply to other agents&#xD;
             used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the&#xD;
             following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible&#xD;
             if they have been disease-free for at least 3 years and are deemed by the investigator&#xD;
             to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following&#xD;
             cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 3 years: cervical cancer&#xD;
             in situ, and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known HIV-positive individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy are eligible so&#xD;
             long as they meet all other criteria. Known HIV-positive individuals who are not on&#xD;
             combination antiretroviral therapy are not eligible because these individuals are at&#xD;
             increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.&#xD;
             Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants receiving combination&#xD;
             antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant malabsorption syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not have received paclitaxel, doxorubicin, or cyclophosphamide as&#xD;
             anti-neoplastic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with prior radiation to the affected breast.&#xD;
