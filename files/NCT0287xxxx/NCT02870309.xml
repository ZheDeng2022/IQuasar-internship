    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, open-label trial to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      weekly intravenous (IV) infusions of 60 mg/kg of the investigational drug in participants&#xD;
      with alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD). The trial will be conducted at approximately 5&#xD;
      medical institutions in Japan, aiming to enroll a minimum of 3 adult participants or more.&#xD;
      The trial will consist of a screening period scheduled within 3 weeks before trial entry, an&#xD;
      open-label treatment period for 8 weeks, and a pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation period for 1&#xD;
      week. At the Week 9 visit when the PK evaluation period is completed, participant will be&#xD;
      asked whether they would like to participate in an extension trial (GTI1401-OLE). For&#xD;
      participants not intending to participate in the extension trial, the date of follow-up/study&#xD;
      completion visit (30 days [4 weeks] after the last dose of the investigational drug) will be&#xD;
      arranged. Participants will participate in this trial for approximately 14 weeks from the&#xD;
      start of the screening period through the completion of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the screening visit (scheduled within 3 weeks before trial entry), after providing&#xD;
      informed consent (agreement based on adequate explanation and understanding of the treatment&#xD;
      plan), participants will be evaluated for eligibility for participation during the screening&#xD;
      period. Participants considered eligible will enter the 8-week treatment period to receive a&#xD;
      total of 8 weekly IV infusions of 60 mg/kg of Alpha-1 MP. The initial IV infusion will be&#xD;
      given at the Week 1 (baseline) visit. During the treatment period, participants will receive&#xD;
      weekly IV infusions of Alpha-1 MP at the Weeks 1 (baseline), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 visits.&#xD;
      After the last IV infusion of Alpha-1 MP at the Week 8 visit, participants will enter the&#xD;
      1-week PK evaluation period. During this PK evaluation period, participants will visit the&#xD;
      study center to undergo blood sampling for PK evaluation at the PK1 visit (the next day of&#xD;
      the Week 8 visit), the PK2 visit (2 days after the Week 8 visit), the PK5 visit (5 days after&#xD;
      the Week 8 visit), and at the Week 9 visit. At 30 days after the last dose (Week 8),&#xD;
      participants will visit the study center for follow-up/study completion (Week 12). All&#xD;
      participants will undergo blood sampling for the measurement of alpha1-PI trough&#xD;
      concentrations at the Weeks 1 (baseline), 7, and 8 visits (blood samples will be collected&#xD;
      before dosing) as well as at the Week 9 visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for the evaluation of PK parameters will be collected from Week 8 to Week 9.&#xD;
      The blood sample collected before the infusion of Alpha-1 MP at the Week 8 visit and the&#xD;
      blood sample for PK evaluation collected at the Week 9 visit (7 days after the infusion at&#xD;
      the Week 8 visit) will be also used for the measurement of alpha1-PI trough concentrations&#xD;
      for Weeks 8 and 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Week 9 visit, participants will be asked whether they would like to participate in the&#xD;
      extension trial (GTI1401-OLE). Participants intending to participate in the extension trial&#xD;
      will be able to continue the treatment with IV infusions of 60 mg/kg of Alpha-1 MP for at&#xD;
      least another year (participants will be further asked whether they would like to continue&#xD;
      the treatment at yearly intervals) for the purpose of evaluation of the safety of long-term&#xD;
      Alpha-1 MP treatment. Participants not intending to enter the extension trial will visit the&#xD;
      study center for follow-up/study completion at 30 days (4 weeks) after the last dose of&#xD;
      Alpha-1 MP (Week 12).&#xD;
