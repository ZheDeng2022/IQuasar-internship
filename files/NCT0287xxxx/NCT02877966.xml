  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the effects of an amino acid mixture&#xD;
      (Amixea) on the body composition as assessed by DXA, and on QMVC as assessed by strain gauge,&#xD;
      in advanced NSCLC patients, compared to placebo, after 10 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to evaluate the activity of Amixea on the degree of protein&#xD;
      synthesis, on the nutritional risk and status and quality of life in advanced NSCLC patients,&#xD;
      compared to placebo, after 10 weeks of treatment. In a small subsample, body composition will&#xD;
      be evaluated opportunistically from clinically available CT scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence to, and patient satisfaction of treatment will be evaluated as exploratory&#xD;
      objectives of this study. Finally, the overall safety and product tolerability will be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Most cancer patients experience weight loss at some time as their disease progresses. The&#xD;
      resulting malnutrition increases risk of treatment complication and may lead to poor&#xD;
      treatment response and/or tolerance, reduced quality of life and poor survival. The&#xD;
      prevalence of malnutrition in cancer patients is thought to be as high as 80%, but reports&#xD;
      vary with cancer location and stage, treatment history, clinical setting and assessment&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight loss with cachexia is a common presenting sign in NSCLC, representing a great concern&#xD;
      for many patients and their families. At this regard, NSCLC cachexia is worth of particular&#xD;
      investigation because of the prevalence of the disease, the frequency with which it is&#xD;
      associated with weight loss and the prognostic implications of weight loss for these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight stabilization may be the most optimistic outcome to be expected in patients with&#xD;
      cachexia and is still beneficial, as weight-losing patients with cancer cachexia who&#xD;
      stabilize their weight have a greater quality of life and survival then those who continue to&#xD;
      lose weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is, in fact, well-known that cachexia increases cancer-related mortality and has&#xD;
      devastating effects on quality of life.Randomized controlled trial data indicate that early&#xD;
      palliative care improves quality of life and depressive symptoms and may extend survival in&#xD;
      advanced NSCLC compared with standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, it has been observed that conventional nutritional supplements are not or only&#xD;
      partly successful in inducing protein accretion in advanced cancer, suggesting an attenuated&#xD;
      anabolic response. To prevent muscle wasting and its deleterious consequences, generating an&#xD;
      anabolic response is crucial. Dietary essential amino acids (EAA) have anabolic properties in&#xD;
      other wasting diseases, however data in advanced cancer are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have analyzed patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with&#xD;
      cachexia or skeletal muscle dysfunction and have demonstrated quadriceps weakness in&#xD;
      one-third of COPD patients attending hospital respiratory outpatient services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An accurate and rapid evaluation of muscle strength which may identify patients with muscle&#xD;
      weakness could be of crucial importance in a prompt and specific intervention in prescribing&#xD;
      an adequate support therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting from these assumptions, the main objectives of this study are to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of an amino acids mixture (Amixea) on the body composition by dual-energy x-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry (DXA), a bone mineral densitometer, and on quadriceps maximal voluntary&#xD;
      contraction force (QMVC) in advanced NSCLC patients, compared to placebo, after 10 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
