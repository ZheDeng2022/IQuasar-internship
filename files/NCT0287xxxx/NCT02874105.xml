    <textblock>
      The rotator cuff tendinopathy is very common and associated with degenerative or traumatic&#xD;
      changes of the rotator cuff and/or the sub-acromial bursa or the long head of the biceps.&#xD;
      Lesions go of the simple tendinopathy without tear to the full-thickness tear of the cuff&#xD;
      which means a loss of mobility or strength. The origin of this pathology remains&#xD;
      controversial and many causes have been evoked (subacromial mechanical impingement,&#xD;
      degenerative changes, muscle imbalance…). The clinical impairment is not always the same and&#xD;
      varies from a painful shoulder with correct range of motion to a pseudoparalysis shoulder.&#xD;
      The first treatment of the rotator cuff pathology is always non surgical and consists in&#xD;
      relative resting, painkillers and/or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAD) and&#xD;
      physiotherapy. The aim of this management is to relieve pain and to restore the mobility and&#xD;
      a good function of the shoulder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no consensus about the physiotherapy protocol for the treatment of the rotator cuff&#xD;
      tendinopathy. In France, the most used physiotherapy protocol uses the strengthening of the&#xD;
      muscles which stabilize the scapula (rhomboide muscles, trapezius and serratus anterior) and&#xD;
      which lower the humerus (pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi and teres major). The aim of this&#xD;
      approach is to augment the subacromial space in order to decrease the inflammation of the&#xD;
      rotator cuff tendons and the associated pain. A technique of Dynamic Humeral Centering (DHC)&#xD;
      uses a new method of glenohumeral centering in closed kinetic chain has been described (&quot;3C&#xD;
      Concept&quot; for Centering in a Closed Chain). Dynamic humeral centring (DHC) is a modality of&#xD;
      physiotherapy that aims to prevent subacromial impingement of rotator cuff tendons. In order&#xD;
      to simplify and to improve its reliability, a special device called Scapuleo® has been&#xD;
      developed. The aim of this device is to help the physiotherapist to realize simultaneously a&#xD;
      subacromial decompression, a specific strengthening of the rotator cuff muscles and an&#xD;
      optimal activation of the lower trapezius and the anterior serratus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis was that the DHC was not inferior to the conventional physiotherapy protocol&#xD;
      for the medical treatment of the rotator cuff tendinopathy without full-thickness tear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We proposed a prospective and randomized study. All the patients treated in our department&#xD;
      for simple tendinopathy of the rotator cuff or partial thickness tear were included in this&#xD;
      study after signed consent. The physiotherapy protocol consists in 20 sessions of either&#xD;
      &quot;Conventional program&quot; (Control group) or &quot;Dynamic Humeral Centering&quot; (Study group). The&#xD;
      clinical evaluation included the range of motion measurement, Constant Score, Quick-DASH and&#xD;
      Oxford Shoulder Score at 3 months and 6 months. Patients were blinded to the study&#xD;
      hypothesis. The assessor of all outcomes was blinded to the interventions.&#xD;

      Shoulder impingement accounts for 44 to 65% of shoulder complaints during physician visits.&#xD;
      Shoulder impingement has been classified into two main categories: structural and functional.&#xD;
      The structural impingement can be caused by narrowing of the subacromial space resulting from&#xD;
      a reduction in the space due to bony growth or soft-tissue inflammation. The functional&#xD;
      impingement or superior migration of the humeral head can be caused by weakness and/or muscle&#xD;
      imbalance. It is possible that some subacromial impingement results from a combination of&#xD;
      both structural and functional factors. Subacromial impingement occurs when the structures in&#xD;
      the SAS (rotator cuff, biceps tendon long head, and subacromial bursa) become compressed and&#xD;
      inflamed under the coracoacromial ligament. The suprasinatus tendon in particular is at&#xD;
      highest risk for irritation and subsequent injury because it is the most likely to contact&#xD;
      the acromion when the humerus is abducted to 90° and internally rotated 45°.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical impairment is not always the same and varies from a painful shoulder with&#xD;
      correct range of motion to a pseudoparalysis shoulder. The first treatment of this&#xD;
      subacromial impingement is always non surgical and consists in relative resting, painkillers&#xD;
      and/or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAD) and physiotherapy. The aim of this&#xD;
      treatment is to relieve pain and to restore the mobility and a good function of the shoulder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no consensus about the physiotherapy protocol for the treatment of the shoulder&#xD;

      Oxford Shoulder Score at 3 months and 6 months. Patients were blinded to the study&#xD;
      hypothesis. The assessor of all outcomes was blinded to the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rhythm of the physiotherapy sessions was the same in both groups (3 sessions per week for&#xD;
      3 weeks, 2 sessions per week for 3 weeks and 1 session per week for 5 weeks). All patients&#xD;
      received passive mobilization of the shoulder without pain and muscle stretching. Each&#xD;
      physiotherapy session lasted 30 minutes and included massage or hot physiotherapy in case of&#xD;
      VAS (visual analogic scale) of pain superior to 6/10.&#xD;
