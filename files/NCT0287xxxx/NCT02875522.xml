  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is smoking, which can lead to&#xD;
      inflammation in the lungs and blood vessels that can lead to secondary problems such as blood&#xD;
      vessel disease, high blood pressure and heart disease. Aerobic exercise training has been&#xD;
      shown to reduce the risk of heart and brain disease; however, it is currently unknown whether&#xD;
      exercise training can have the same affect in patients with COPD. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate how eight weeks of aerobic exercise training improves blood vessel and heart&#xD;
      function and brain blood flow in patients with COPD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a treatable respiratory condition that is&#xD;
      only partially reversible. The primary cause of COPD is smoking which leads to airway&#xD;
      inflammation and oxidative damage to the lungs, which has been linked to the development and&#xD;
      progression of the disease. The inflammation is not isolated to the lungs as patients with&#xD;
      COPD also have systemic inflammation that has been linked to a number of cardiovascular&#xD;
      comorbidities such as endothelial dysfunction, cardiovascular disease and stroke. Evidence&#xD;
      demonstrates that COPD patients have a greater incidence of vascular dysfunction and adverse&#xD;
      vascular remodeling, which worsens with disease severity. In fact, patients with COPD are at&#xD;
      35 times greater risk of developing cardiovascular disease and stroke than healthy aged&#xD;
      matched individuals. In healthy individuals and a number of chronic conditions, aerobic&#xD;
      exercise training is well established to reduce the risk of cardiovascular and&#xD;
      cerebrovascular disease. The benefits of exercise are likely through improvements in&#xD;
      endothelial function, systemic inflammation, and cardiac and cerebral vascular function.&#xD;
      However, whether exercise training can have the same effects in a chronic inflammatory&#xD;
      condition like COPD has not been studied. The purpose of this study is to determine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of an 8 week aerobic exercise training program in patient's chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease as determined by improvements in endothelial function, systemic&#xD;
      inflammation and cardiac and cerebral vascular function.&#xD;
