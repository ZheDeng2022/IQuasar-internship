      The purpose of the study is to use a novel treatment approach, the artificial pancreas, after&#xD;
      diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (T1D) to improve glucose control with the anticipated&#xD;
      improvements of residual C-peptide secretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label, multicentre, single-period, randomised, parallel group design study.&#xD;
      It is expected that a total of up to 190 subjects (aiming for 96 randomised subjects) will be&#xD;
      recruited within ten working days of diagnosis of type 1 diabetes through paediatric diabetes&#xD;
      centres in the UK. Half of the participants aged 10 to 16.9 years will be treated by&#xD;
      conventional insulin injections and the other half by the artificial pancreas (closed loop&#xD;
      insulin delivery system). Each treatment will last 24 months. All participants completing the&#xD;
      24 month study period will be invited to continue in an optional extension phase with the&#xD;
      treatment allocated at randomisation for a further 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in the intervention group will receive additional training on components of the&#xD;
      artificial pancreas, i.e. insulin pump and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), prior to&#xD;
      starting closed loop insulin delivery. Subjects in the control intervention group will&#xD;
      continue with standard therapy, i.e. multiple daily injection therapy. The study includes up&#xD;
      to 14 visits and 1 telephone/email contact for subjects completing the study. After run-in&#xD;
      and randomisation, visits will be conducted every 3 months in both arms. Beta-cell function&#xD;
      will be assessed by serial measurement of C-peptide in response to a standardised mixed meal&#xD;
      tolerance test (MMTT). MMTTs will be conducted at baseline, 6-,12- and 24 months post&#xD;
      diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the between group difference in the area under the stimulated&#xD;
      C-peptide curve (AUC) of the MMTT at 12 month post diagnosis. Secondary outcomes include&#xD;
      between group differences in stimulated C-peptide AUC over 24 months, differences in&#xD;
      glycaemic control as assessed by HbA1c, time spent in glucose target range, glucose&#xD;
      variability, hypo- and hyperglycaemia as recorded by periodically applied CGM, as well as&#xD;
      insulin requirements and change in bodyweight. Additionally, cognitive, emotional and&#xD;
      behavioural characteristics of participating subjects and parents will be assessed, and a&#xD;
      cost utility analysis on the benefits of closed loop insulin delivery will be performed.&#xD;
      Safety evaluation comprises assessment of the frequency of severe hypoglycaemic episodes,&#xD;
      diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and number, nature and severity of other adverse events.&#xD;

      Purpose of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether continued intensive metabolic control using closed loop insulin&#xD;
           delivery (CL) following diagnosis of type 1 diabetes can preserve C-peptide secretion as&#xD;
           a marker of residual beta cell function compared to standard multiple daily injections&#xD;
           (MDI) therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess residual C-peptide secretion 12 months after diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in&#xD;
           participants receiving either CL insulin delivery or standard MDI therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biochemical:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To compare effects of study interventions on residual C-peptide secretion over 24&#xD;
                months following diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To examine how intensive diabetes management using CL insulin delivery affects&#xD;
                glucose control in terms of safety and efficacy over 24 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Human Factors: To assess cognitive, emotional, and behavioural characteristics of&#xD;
           participating subjects and family members and their response to closed loop insulin&#xD;
           delivery and clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health economics: To perform cost utility analysis and inform reimbursement&#xD;
           decision-making&#xD;

        -  computerised cognitive testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  initiating blinded CGM to assess baseline glycaemic control&#xD;
&#xD;
      Run in period:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following consent/screening and baseline assessment, multiple daily injection therapy&#xD;
           will be continued in all participants. All participants will receive non study related&#xD;
           core diabetes training as per usual clinical practice for a period of up to three weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All subjects will be provided with 24 hour telephone helpline and will also be given&#xD;
           written instructions about when to contact clinical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible participants will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio using central randomisation&#xD;
           software to either closed loop or standard therapy i.e. MDI.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Closed loop (interventional arm) Following randomisation, participants in the&#xD;
                closed loop group will receive additional training sessions to cover key aspects of&#xD;
                insulin pump use and CGM, prior to starting closed loop insulin delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Once competent in the use of the study pump and CGM system, participants will&#xD;
                receive training required for safe and effective use of the closed loop system.&#xD;
                During a 2-4 hour session participants will operate the system under the&#xD;
                supervision of the clinical team. Competency on the use of closed loop system will&#xD;
                be evaluated. Thereafter, participants are expected to use closed loop for 24&#xD;
                months without supervision or remote monitoring. The 24 hour support helpline will&#xD;
                be available in case of problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Multiple daily injections (control arm) Participants in the control group will&#xD;
                receive additional training sessions following randomisation including a refresher&#xD;
                on carbohydrate counting skills, and insulin dose adjustments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard therapy (i.e. MDI) will be applied for 24 months. Participants will be allowed to&#xD;
      switch to insulin pump therapy if clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up assessments (3-, 6-, 9-, 12-, 15-, 18-, 21- months):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow up study visits will be conducted 3 monthly including data downloads/recording of&#xD;
           insulin requirements, adverse event recording, and blood sampling (HbA1c).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be fitted with blinded CGM systems at the end of each follow up visit.&#xD;
           The sensors will be worn at home for up to 14 days and will be sent back to the research&#xD;
           team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MMTTs will be performed at 6 month and 12 month follow up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sleep will be assessed using a wristwatch device for 7 days following study visits at 6&#xD;
           and 12 months post diagnosis. Concomitantly, a sleep diary and sleep quality&#xD;
           questionnaire will be distributed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Validated questionnaires evaluating the impact of the technology on quality of life,&#xD;
           life change, diabetes management and fear of hypoglycaemia will be completed at the 12&#xD;
           month visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At 12 months, participants will repeat the computerised cognitive tests first&#xD;
           administered at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Qualitative interviews will be conducted at month 12 in a subset of subjects and parents&#xD;
           int he closed-loop arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of study assessments (24 months):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A MMTT will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A blood sample will be taken for measurement of HbA1c, lipids and immunological&#xD;
           analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Validated questionnaires evaluating the impact of the technology on quality of life,&#xD;
           life change, diabetes management and fear of hypoglycaemia will be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will repeat the computerised cognitive tests first administered at&#xD;
           baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sleep will be assessed using a wristwatch device for 7 days within the last month of the&#xD;
           trial. Concomitantly, a sleep diary and sleep quality questionnaire will be distributed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants and families will be invited to attend focus group discussions. 24-hour&#xD;
           telephone helpline:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In case of any technical device or problems related to diabetes management such as hypo-&#xD;
           or hyperglycaemia, subjects will be able to contact a 24-hour telephone helpline to the&#xD;
           local clinical and research team at any time. The local research team will have access&#xD;
           to central 24 hour advice on technical issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures for safety monitoring during trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard operating procedures for monitoring and reporting of all adverse events (AE)&#xD;
           will be in place, including serious adverse events (SAE), serious adverse device effects&#xD;
           (SADE) and specific adverse events such as severe hypoglycaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be asked to test and record blood or urine ketones if their finger prick&#xD;
           glucose is above 14.0 mmol/l, as part of the safety assessment for hyperglycaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A data monitoring and ethics committee (DMEC) will be informed of all serious adverse&#xD;
           events and any unanticipated serious adverse device effects that occur during the study&#xD;
           and will review compiled adverse event data at periodic intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for withdrawal of patients on safety grounds:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A subject, parent, or guardian may terminate participation in the study at any time&#xD;
           without necessarily giving a reason and without any personal disadvantage. An&#xD;
           investigator can stop the participation of a subject after consideration of the&#xD;
           benefit/risk ratio. Possible reasons are:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Serious adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Significant protocol violation or non-compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Failure to satisfy competency assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Decision by the investigator, or the Sponsor, that termination is in the subject's&#xD;
                best medical interest&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Pregnancy, planned pregnancy, or breast feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Allergic reaction to insulin Efforts will be made to retain subjects in follow up&#xD;
                for the final primary outcome assessment even if the intervention is discontinued,&#xD;
                unless the investigator believes that it will be harmful for the subject to&#xD;
                continue in the trial.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosis of type 1 diabetes within previous 21 days. Day 1 will be defined as the day&#xD;
             insulin was first administered. Type 1 diabetes will be defined according to WHO&#xD;
             criteria using standard diagnostic practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
             [WHO definition: 'The aetiological type named type 1 encompasses the majority of cases&#xD;
             with are primarily due to beta-cell destruction, and are prone to ketoacidosis. Type 1&#xD;
             includes those cases attributable to an autoimmune process, as well as those with&#xD;
             beta-cell destruction for which neither an aetiology nor a pathogenesis is known&#xD;
             (idiopathic). It does not include those forms of beta-cell destruction or failure to&#xD;
             which specific causes can be assigned (e.g. cystic fibrosis, mitochondrial defects,&#xD;
             etc.).']&#xD;
