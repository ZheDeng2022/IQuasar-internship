      Objectives: Main objective: To compare the percentage of patients with new microaneurysm or&#xD;
      hard exudates after 12 months between the CPAP group and the control group. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives: To compare the central macula volume, ganglion cell layer thickness and central&#xD;
      fovea thickness at baseline and 12, 24 and 52 weeks after randomization between the two study&#xD;
      groups; to compare the percentage of patients who have an improvement loss of visual acuity&#xD;
      (more than or equal to 15 letters in patients with macular edema and more than or equal to&#xD;
      five letters in patients without macular edema) among the baseline visit and the weeks 12, 24&#xD;
      and 52 between the two study groups; to compare the percentage of patients who reach a higher&#xD;
      level of diabetic retinopathy at 54 weeks between the two study groups; to compare the&#xD;
      resolution time of central macula thickness from the randomization between the two study&#xD;
      groups; to compare the glycated hemoglobin at baseline and 12, 24 and 52 weeks after&#xD;
      randomization between the two study groups; and to compare the serum levels of inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines, oxidative stress biomarkers, sympathetic tone, and intake regulator hormones at&#xD;
      baseline and 12 and 52 weeks after randomization between the two study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Randomized, multicenter, non-blinded, parallel groups, conventional&#xD;
      treatment-controlled trial of 12 months of duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will randomize to conventional dietary and pharmacological treatment or conventional&#xD;
      dietary and pharmacological treatment plus continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Study&#xD;
      subjects: Subjects 35 to 75 years with type 2 diabetes and a clinical diagnosis of mild&#xD;
      diabetic retinopathy (with or without macular edema), better visual acuity from 20/40 to&#xD;
      20/320 letters and refraction with a spherical equivalent less than ± 5 diopter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy variables: Thickness of the central sub-field, central subfield volume, ganglion&#xD;
      cell layer thickness, and presence of clinical or subclinical macular edema, serous retinal&#xD;
      or retinal pigment epithelium detachment, intraretinal cysts or haemorrhages assessed by&#xD;
      optical coherence tomography; presence of cotton exudates, microhemorrhages, microaneurysms,&#xD;
      , microvascular retinal abnormalities, or a vein/artery ratio &gt; 2/1 in examination of ocular&#xD;
      fundus/retinography; better corrected visual acuity; glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c); fasting&#xD;
      glucose and insulin; homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) and QUICKI indices; lipid profile,&#xD;
      troponin I, proBNP, homocysteine and C-reactive protein; systemic biomarkers of inflammation,&#xD;
      oxidative stress, endothelial damage, sympathetic activity and appetite-regulating hormones&#xD;
      and clinical questionnaires: short form (SF)-12, visual function questionnaire (VFQ25) and&#xD;
      iPAQ.&#xD;
