    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a combination of targeted therapy and hormonal therapy as a&#xD;
      possible treatment for breast cancer that has spread to other places in the body and is&#xD;
      hormone receptor positive (HR+) and HER2-negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study interventions involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Palbociclib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Everolimus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exemestane&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II clinical trial. The Phase I portion of this clinical trial tests the&#xD;
      safety of an investigational intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of&#xD;
      the investigational intervention to use for further studies. The Phase II portion of the&#xD;
      study tests the safety and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether&#xD;
      the intervention works in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the&#xD;
      intervention is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the combination of&#xD;
      Palbociclib, Everolimus, and Exemestane as a treatment for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first time that the combination of Palbociclib, Everolimus, and Exemestane will&#xD;
      be given to humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Palbociclib is a drug that may stop cancer cells from growing. Palbociclib blocks activity of&#xD;
      two closely related enzymes (proteins that help chemical reactions occur in the body), called&#xD;
      Cyclin D Kinases 4 and 6 (CDK 4/6). These proteins are part of a pathway, or a sequence of&#xD;
      steps, which is known to regulate cell growth. Laboratory testing has suggested Palbociclib&#xD;
      may stop the growth of HR+ breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Everolimus is a type of drug called an mTORinhibitor that treats breast cancer by preventing&#xD;
      the cells from multiplying by inhibiting the pathway, or a sequence of steps, known to&#xD;
      regulate cell reproduction. Everolimus also may stop the growth of cancer cells by decreasing&#xD;
      blood supply to the cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exemestane is an anti-hormone therapy that prevents breast cancer cell growth by blocking&#xD;
      estrogen receptor stimulation. Premenopausal women will also receive an injection drug called&#xD;
      an LHRH (luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone) agonist to shut down ovary function. It is&#xD;
      standard of care for people with breast cancer, specifically with HR+ breast cancer, to take&#xD;
      anti-hormone therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of everolimus and exemestane is FDA approved to treat this type of breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the Phase I portion of this research study is to determine a safe and&#xD;
      tolerable dose of the combination of Palbociclib, Everolimus, and Exemestane for participants&#xD;
      with ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the Phase II portion of this research study is to determine whether the&#xD;
      combination of Palbociclib, Everolimus, and Exemestane is an effective treatment for&#xD;
      participants with ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.&#xD;

             of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status â‰¤2 (Karnofsky â‰¥60%, see Appendix A)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For participants enrolling the phase IIa part of the study, accessible tumor lesion(s)&#xD;
             for the purpose of research biopsy and willingness to undergo a research biopsy before&#xD;
             treatment initiation and at the time of disease progression, as well as a single&#xD;
             research blood sample before initiation of therapy. Participants who undergo an&#xD;
             attempted on-treatment research biopsy and in whom inadequate tissue is obtained are&#xD;
             still eligible to receive protocol therapy. They will not be required to undergo a&#xD;
             repeat research biopsy attempt.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For participants enrolling the phase IIa part of the study, willingness to provide&#xD;
             archival tumor samples when available.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have normal organ and marrow function, as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count â‰¥1,5x109/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  platelets â‰¥100 x109/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total hemoglobin â‰¥ 9 g/dL (which may be post transfusion)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin â‰¤1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) â‰¤2.5 Ã— institutional upper limit of normal or â‰¤5 Ã—&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  fasting plasma glucose &lt;140 mg/dL / 7.8 mmol/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of the combination of palbociclib, everolimus and exemestane on the&#xD;
             developing human fetus are unknown. Given that women in this study will be&#xD;
             post-menopausal by eligibility criteria (de facto or pharmacologically induced), it is&#xD;
             expected that there will be no women of child-bearing potential in this study. If, for&#xD;
             any reason, a woman should become pregnant or suspect that she is pregnant while&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Of&#xD;
             note, premenopausal women and men are only eligible if they have been on a GnRH&#xD;
             agonist for at least 6 weeks prior to study entry. These participants MUST remain on&#xD;
             the GnRH agonist for the duration of protocol treatment. Such participants should be&#xD;
             counseled prior to study entry that GnRH agonists alone may not be adequate&#xD;
             contraception and that adequate contraception (barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
             abstinence) should be employed for the duration of study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have demonstrated intolerance to 125mg of Palbociclib are ineligible&#xD;
             for the Phase I portion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have received previous treatment with an mTOR inhibitor or&#xD;
             exemestane.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar&#xD;
             chemical or biologic composition to palbociclib, everolimus or exemestane.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known brain metastases may be enrolled in this study if radiation&#xD;
             therapy and/or surgery have been completed with a minimum of 3 months of stable&#xD;
             disease demonstrated on serial evaluation by CT (with contrast enhancement) or MRI.&#xD;
             Such participants must no longer require treatment with corticosteroids or enzyme&#xD;
             inducing anti-epileptic medications for their CNS disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with bilateral diffuse lymphangitic carcinomatosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with significant symptomatic deterioration of lung function. If&#xD;
             clinically indicated, pulmonary function tests including measures of predicted lung&#xD;
             volumes, DLco, O2 saturation at rest on room air should be considered to exclude&#xD;
             restrictive pulmonary disease, pneumonitis or pulmonary infiltrates.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of current pneumonitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with organ allograft requiring immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable&#xD;
                  angina pectoris, symptomatic cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social&#xD;
                  situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Ability to comply&#xD;
                  with study requirements is to be assessed by each investigator at the time of&#xD;
                  screening for study participation;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Impairment of gastrointestinal function or who have gastrointestinal disease that&#xD;
                  may significantly alter the absorption of study drugs (e.g., ulcerative disease,&#xD;
                  uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or malabsorption syndrome).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants receiving any medications or substances that are moderate or strong&#xD;
             inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A within 7 days of registration. Lists including&#xD;
             medications and substances known or with the potential to interact with the CYP3A&#xD;
             isoenzymes are provided in Appendix B, and can also be found within Sections 2.4.1.2&#xD;
             and 5.8. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to&#xD;
             regularly consult a frequently-updated list such as:&#xD;
             http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx; medical reference texts such as&#xD;
             the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this information. As part of the&#xD;
             enrollment/informed consent procedures, the participant will be counseled on the risk&#xD;
             of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be&#xD;
             prescribed or if the participant is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or&#xD;
             herbal product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Proton pump inhibitors(PPI) may be taken while on study, however it is recommended&#xD;
             that the PPI is taken 12 hours from the time of palbociclib administration. If needed,&#xD;
             alternative antacid therapies may be used including H2-receptor antagonists and&#xD;
             locally acting antacids. H2-receptor antagonists should be administered with a&#xD;
             staggered dosing regimen (twice daily). The dosing of palbociclib should occur at&#xD;
             least 10 hours after H2-receptor antagonist evening dose and 2 hours before the&#xD;
             H2-receptor antagonist morning dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the&#xD;
             following circumstances: a) if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years and&#xD;
             are deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy; b)&#xD;
             if diagnosed with the following cancers and treated within the past 5 years: ductal&#xD;
             carcinoma in situ of the breast, cervical cancer in situ, and basal cell or squamous&#xD;
             cell carcinoma of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants known to be HIV-positive on combination antiretroviral therapy are&#xD;
             ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with palbociclib&#xD;
             and everolimus. In addition, these individuals are at increased risk of lethal&#xD;
             infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be&#xD;
             undertaken in participants receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when&#xD;
             indicated. Screening for HIV infection at baseline is not required.&#xD;
