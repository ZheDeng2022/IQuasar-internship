  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm phase II clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of the PD-L1&#xD;
      inhibitor durvalumab as first-line therapy in 50 patients with advanced NSCLC and ECOG&#xD;
      Performance Status 2 (PS2).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Durvalumab will be supplied in glass vials containing 500 mg of liquid solution at a&#xD;
      concentration of 50 mg/mL for intravenous (IV) administration. Durvalumab will be&#xD;
      administered at 1500 mg (fixed dose) every 4 weeks until disease progression, death,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent for a maximum of 12 months of therapy.&#xD;

    <description>The duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST v1.0 Progressive Disease (PD) for target lesions: At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions). For non-target lesions:Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.</description>

    <description>Proportion of patients who achieve either a Complete Response or Partial Response to study treatment. Per RECIST v1.0, for target lesions: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. For non-target lesions: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (&lt;10 mm short axis). If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response. Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.</description>
