      The purpose of this study is to determine if E7070 is an efficacious, safe, and tolerable&#xD;
      treatment for patients with metastatic breast cancer who have failed, or could not tolerate,&#xD;
      prior treatments with an anthracycline, a taxane, and capecitabine.&#xD;

             transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) &lt;= 3 times ULN, unless related to&#xD;
             liver metastasis, in which case &lt;= 5 x ULN,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have serum electrolytes including calcium (corrected for albumin),&#xD;
