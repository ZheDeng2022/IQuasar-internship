      This study will examine the effectiveness of treating advanced melanoma with special&#xD;
      tumor-fighting cells taken from the patient's blood or tumor and grown in the laboratory. The&#xD;
      cells are given along with infusions of a growth factor-like substance called interleukin-2&#xD;
      (IL-2) and an experimental vaccine called fowlpox gp100. This vaccine consists of a peptide&#xD;
      (part of a protein) called gp100 that is often found in melanoma tumors and chicken virus&#xD;
      (fowlpox) that has been altered so that it cannot produce illness in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 16 years of age and older with melanoma that has spread beyond the original site and&#xD;
      that does not respond to standard treatment may be eligible for this study. Candidates are&#xD;
      screened with a medical history and physical examination, chest x-ray, electrocardiogram,&#xD;
      blood and urine tests, and x-rays and scans to the evaluate the extent and size of the tumor.&#xD;
      Because the experimental preparation is based on tissue type, only patients with tissue type&#xD;
      HLA-A*0201 may participate. Tissue type is determined by a blood test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Leukapheresis, a procedure for collecting lymphocytes (white blood cells): Using this&#xD;
           procedure, special cells with good tumor-fighting ability are selected and removed for&#xD;
           later re-infusion into the patient. To collect the cells, blood is withdrawn through a&#xD;
           needle in an arm vein and directed through a catheter into a cell-separating machine.&#xD;
           The lymphocytes are removed and the rest of the blood is returned to the body through&#xD;
           the same needle. Alternatively, lymphocytes may also be collected from biopsied tumor&#xD;
           tissue, obtained either with a needle or by a small cut in the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  G-CSF injections: This growth factor is injected under the skin every day for 5 days to&#xD;
           stimulate white blood cell production.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Catheter placement: Upon admission to the Clinical Center for treatment, the patient has&#xD;
           a catheter (plastic tube) placed in a vein in the neck or arm for giving chemotherapy&#xD;
           and other medicines, for infusing the lymphocytes, and for collecting blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Leukapheresis: Repeated in the hospital to collect and store blood that may be needed in&#xD;
           the rare event that the patient's blood components do not recover after chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chemotherapy: A week before the lymphocyte infusion, patients receive a 1-hour infusion&#xD;
           of cyclophosphamide for 2 days and then a 15- to 30-minute infusion of fludarabine for 5&#xD;
           days to suppress the immune system and thereby prevent rejection of the infused&#xD;
           lymphocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vaccine and lymphocyte delivery: The vaccine is injected through the catheter, followed&#xD;
           by a 30-minute infusion of the lymphocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IL-2 and G-CSF: Patients receive IL-2 infusions every 8 hours for up to 5 days after the&#xD;
           cell infusion to help keep the cells alive, and G-CSF injections under the skin every&#xD;
           day after the cell infusion until white cells increase to a sufficient number. The&#xD;
           entire hospital stay is usually 12 to 16 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 4 weeks after the lymphocyte infusion, patients are re-admitted to the hospital for&#xD;
      about 10 days for a second vaccine injection and course of IL-2 infusions. Between 2 and 4&#xD;
      weeks after completing the full treatment regimen, patients return to NIH for evaluation.&#xD;
      Those whose tumors have shrunk or remained stable may repeat the entire treatment regimen two&#xD;
      times. Those whose tumors continued to grow may be re-treated with infusion of lymphocytes&#xD;
      through an artery instead of a vein if their tumors receive blood from a major artery. If&#xD;
      this is not feasible, or if it is tried without success, the patients will be taken off the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent clinical studies in the Surgery Branch have demonstrated clinical responses in&#xD;
      patients undergoing adoptive transfer of autologous tumor reactive lymphocytes following a&#xD;
      non-myeloablative immunosuppressive chemotherapy regimen. Additional studies in the Surgery&#xD;
      Branch using immunization with recombinant fowlpox virus after cell transfer in the&#xD;
      immunosuppressed host have provided strong evidence to suggest that the adoptive transfer of&#xD;
      lymphocytes in our clinical protocols in patients with melanoma will be substantially&#xD;
      improved by the simultaneous administration of recombinant fowlpox virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective will be to determine whether gp100 reactive lymphocytes infused in&#xD;
      conjunction with immunization with rf-gp100P209 and administration of high dose or low dose&#xD;
      IL-2 may result in complete clinical tumor regression in patients with metastatic melanoma&#xD;
      receiving a nonmyeloablative but lymphoid depleting preparative regimen. Secondary objectives&#xD;
      will be to determine the survival in patients, of infused cells following this regimen, and&#xD;
      to determine the safety of this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are HLA-A201+ must be greater than or equal to 16 years of age and have&#xD;
      measurable metastatic melanoma that is refractory to standard therapy. Safety laboratory&#xD;
      values must be within defined parameters. More than four weeks must have elapsed since any&#xD;
      prior systemic therapy. Patients must be eligible to receive IL-2 and may not have cardiac,&#xD;
      pulmonary or other major medical illnesses. Patients may not be allergic to eggs or&#xD;
      hypersensitivity to any agents used in this trial, must not require concomitant therapy with&#xD;
      steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive a nonmyeloablative but lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen&#xD;
      consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine and then will be treated by the adoptive&#xD;
      transfer of lymphocytes reactive with the gp100:209-217 melanoma antigen, immunization with&#xD;
      intravenous fowlpox virus rF-gp100P209, and the administration of high dose or low dose IL-2.&#xD;
      Approximately 28 days after the cell infusion, patients receiving high dose IL-2 will receive&#xD;
      a second intravenous fowlpox virus rf-gp100P209 followed by administration of high dose IL-2.&#xD;
      A complete evaluation of evaluable lesions will be conducted 6-8 weeks after cell infusion.&#xD;
      Patients receiving low dose IL-2 will receive a second intravenous fowlpox virus rf-gp100P209&#xD;
      after the 6 weeks of injections and one week of rest followed by repeat administration of the&#xD;
      six week cycle of low dose IL-2. A complete evaluation of evaluable lesions will be conducted&#xD;
      3 weeks after the last dose of low dose IL-2. For each of the two cohorts, a small optimal&#xD;
      Phase II design will be used and will target 15% (p1=0.15) as a goal for complete response as&#xD;
      opposed essentially zero probability normally associated with patients who relapse after high&#xD;
      dose IL-2 alone (p0=0.02 will be used). Initially, 16 patients will be enrolled and evaluated&#xD;
      in each cohort; if at least 1 of the first 16 patients has a complete response, then accrual&#xD;
      to 29 patients will take place. It is expected that it will require 2-3 years to accrue all&#xD;
      58 patients to this study.&#xD;
