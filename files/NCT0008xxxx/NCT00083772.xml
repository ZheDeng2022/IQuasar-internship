  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary objective is to assess the effect of nesiritide in decreasing left ventricular (LV)&#xD;
      filling pressure, defined as pulmonary artery capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) in a group of&#xD;
      patients admitted with acute diastolic heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include: improvement in symptoms, exercise tolerance, improvement in&#xD;
      Doppler diastolic filling parameters in patients with diastolic heart failure.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with diastolic heart failure often have high pressure in their heart and lungs and&#xD;
      many symptoms such as shortness of breath, low energy, fluid retention, and fatigue.&#xD;
      Decreasing the pressure in the heart and lungs may help these patients feel better. The drug&#xD;
      nesiritide was designed to help treat heart failure. It has also been shown to help decrease&#xD;
      the pressure in the lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before treatment starts, you will be asked questions about your medical history and about any&#xD;
      medications you are currently taking. You will have a complete physical exam. You will have&#xD;
      an electrocardiogram (ECG - a test that measures the electrical activity of the heart) and&#xD;
      routine blood tests (about 2 teaspoons). You will have an ultrasound on your heart called an&#xD;
      echocardiogram to measure your heart function and the pressures in your lungs. Your ability&#xD;
      to breathe will be evaluated. With the aid of the research nurse, you will have a 6-minute&#xD;
      walk test. You may stop or sit down at any time during the test. This test is being done to&#xD;
      evaluate your energy level. You will also be asked to complete a questionnaire about your&#xD;
      symptoms. This questionnaire should take no more than 10 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to measure the pressure in your heart and lungs, you will have a procedure called a&#xD;
      &quot;right heart catheterization&quot;. This is a procedure that may have been done as part of your&#xD;
      standard of care even if you were not enrolled in this study. For this procedure, a small&#xD;
      tube will be placed in a vein in your neck. A longer tube will be inserted into the first&#xD;
      tube and fed through the vein and into your heart. This tube will be used to measure the&#xD;
      pressure in your heart and lungs. After the pressures are measured, you will receive&#xD;
      treatment with nesiritide during the right heart catheterization procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nesiritide will be given as a continuous infusion (for 48 hours) by vein. The pressures in&#xD;
      your heart and lungs will be measured again at 15, 30, then 60 minutes after you begin to&#xD;
      receive nesiritide. The tubes will then be removed from your heart. You will be awake during&#xD;
      this procedure and lying flat on your back. An anesthetic will be used to numb the area of&#xD;
      your neck where the tube is placed. The entire procedure (including treatment) should take no&#xD;
      longer than 1 hour. You will have an ultrasound of your heart performed immediately before&#xD;
      and after the right heart catheterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 15 minutes of the end of the procedure the echocardiogram, the 6-minute walk test, and&#xD;
      the questionnaire about your symptoms will be repeated and your breathing will be&#xD;
      re-evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nesiritide infusion will remain going through a vein in your arm for the next 48 hours.&#xD;
      During this infusion you will remain in the hospital on telemetry floor so that researchers&#xD;
      can monitor your blood pressure and watch for irregular heartbeat. After you have received&#xD;
      this drug for 48 hours, the drug will be stopped. Within 24 hours after stopping treatment,&#xD;
      an echocardiogram and a 6-minute walk test will be performed. You will also answer questions&#xD;
      about your breathing and your quality of life. These should take no more than 15 minutes of&#xD;
      your time to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be taken off study if your condition gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 2 and 4 weeks after your hospitalization and the right heart procedure, you will have&#xD;
      follow-up visits scheduled. At these visits, you will have a complete physical exam, and&#xD;
      possibly have blood work done if required by the doctor as part of your routine care. A blood&#xD;
      test to check a BNP (B-type natriuretic peptide) level will also be performed . This is a&#xD;
      special blood test to give researchers information about your heart and how much extra fluid&#xD;
      you may be carrying with you because of your heart disease. Only 1 teaspoon of blood is&#xD;
      needed for this test although up to 3 teaspoons of blood may need to be drawn depending of&#xD;
      what blood tests your doctor orders at the follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Nesiritide is FDA approved and is commercially available&#xD;
      for the treatment of heart failure. However, the use of nesiritide for diastolic heart&#xD;
      failure is under research. About 20 patients will take part in this study. All will be&#xD;
      enrolled at UTMDACC.&#xD;
