    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to compare the survival of patients with metastatic&#xD;
      malignant melanoma treated with Taxoprexin Injection to those treated with Dacarbazine. In&#xD;
      addition, the response rate to each drug, response duration, time to progression and time to&#xD;
      treatment failure will be measured. Toxicity will be evaluated and compared between the two&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
