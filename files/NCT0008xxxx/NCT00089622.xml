      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a skin patch formulation of the dopamine&#xD;
      agonist Lisuride in controlling parkinsonian symptoms and dyskinesias (involuntary movements)&#xD;
      caused by levodopa. Lisuride is currently available in tablet form; this study will test&#xD;
      whether a patch formulation that provides continuous stimulation of the dopamine receptors&#xD;
      will better control disease symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients between 40 and 80 years old with Parkinson's disease and dyskinesias may be eligible&#xD;
      for this 4-month study. Participants undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and baseline evaluation: Participants are evaluated with a medical history,&#xD;
      physical examination, neurologic evaluation, blood tests, urinalysis, and electrocardiogram.&#xD;
      A chest X-ray and MRI or CT scan of the brain are done, if needed. If possible, patients stop&#xD;
      taking all antiparkinsonian medications except levodopa (Sinemet) for 1 month (2 months for&#xD;
      Selegiline) before the study begins and throughout its duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose-finding phase: Patients are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for 2 to 3 days for a&#xD;
      levodopa &quot;dose-finding&quot; procedure. For this test, patients stop taking Sinemet and instead&#xD;
      have levodopa infused through a vein. During the infusions, the drug dose is increased slowly&#xD;
      until parkinsonian symptoms improve or unacceptable side effects occur or the maximum study&#xD;
      dose is reached. Symptoms are monitored frequently. (Patients who have had dosing infusions&#xD;
      in the last 3 months do not have to undergo this phase of the study.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active study phase: Patients are randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. One group&#xD;
      receives a placebo (a patch with no active drug) and a patch that contains Lisuride; the&#xD;
      other group receives placebo throughout the entire study. Patients are instructed on how to&#xD;
      apply the patches. During the first 2 weeks of this study phase, the number of patches&#xD;
      containing active drug is gradually increased until the individual's optimum dose is reached.&#xD;
      Patches are changed about every 2 days. During this time, intake of other antiparkinsonian&#xD;
      medications is tapered down and patients are evaluated frequently. For the next 3 months,&#xD;
      patients wear the patches continuously at the optimum dose. The patches are changed every 2&#xD;
      days or once a week, depending on the individual patient's need. Two levodopa infusion&#xD;
      studies are done in the active study phase as they were in the dose-finding phase - at the&#xD;
      beginning of the dose escalation phase and again at the end of the dose maintenance phase. In&#xD;
      addition, patients are tested for their ability to perform different motor tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep studies: Because oral Lisuride can cause excessive sleepiness, some patients are asked&#xD;
      to participate in a sleep study to evaluate sleep patterns during the night and daytime&#xD;
      sleepiness. The subject's brain, muscles, and breathing are continuously monitored during&#xD;
      sleep. Also, an electroencephalogram (EEG) is done to record brain waves while the subject&#xD;
      lies quietly, breathes deeply, watches flashes of light, sleeps, or performs a task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety checks: Patients are monitored closely for safety with a history of side effects,&#xD;
      blood tests, and ECG each time a new supply of study drug is dispensed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: 2 weeks after completing the active phase of the study, patients are contacted by&#xD;
      phone for a follow-up evaluation.&#xD;

      Introduction: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive degenerative disease of unknown&#xD;
      etiology. Treatment is symptomatic and the most successful approach has been to replace the&#xD;
      missing dopamine through administration of its precursor levodopa. As the disease progresses,&#xD;
      the usefulness of this approach gradually diminishes, and motor complications become a source&#xD;
      of significant disability. Although a number of pharmacological strategies have attempted to&#xD;
      improve this situation, none has yet proven fully satisfactory. A novel transcutaneous&#xD;
      formulation of the dopamine agonist lisuride will be used to test the ability of this&#xD;
      approach to reduce levodopa-induced motor response complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The objective of this study is to evaluate the risks and benefits of continuous&#xD;
      dopaminomimetic replacement therapy in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Approximately 22 moderately advanced parkinsonian patients will be enrolled&#xD;
      into a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, proof-of-principle study, lasting&#xD;
      approximately 16 weeks. Lisuride efficacy will be assessed through the use of validated motor&#xD;
      function scales. Safety will be monitored by means of frequent clinical evaluations and&#xD;
      laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated Risks and Benefits: The potential risks associated with this study amount to only&#xD;
      a minor increase over minimal risk and are primarily associated with adverse reactions to the&#xD;
      medications involved. Lisuride has been approved for use in Europe for more than 20 years and&#xD;
      has a wide margin of safety. Patients receiving drug could benefit from improvement of their&#xD;
      clinical condition; those on placebo will also receive proper medical care that may lead to a&#xD;
      better quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Estimate and Potential Meaning for the Field: This study should further the&#xD;
      understanding of mechanisms contributing to motor disability in patients with PD and thus&#xD;
      lead to the development of improved therapeutic interventions for this disorder and for&#xD;
      associated motor response complications.&#xD;
