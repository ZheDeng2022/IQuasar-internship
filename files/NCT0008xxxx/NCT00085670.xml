  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether cytokine gene polymorphisms affect the progression or&#xD;
      response to therapy of bone marrow failure disorders. Cytokine genes instruct cells to&#xD;
      produce proteins called cytokines that influence immune system response. As with many genes,&#xD;
      the cytokine genes differ slightly from person to person. These differences are called gene&#xD;
      polymorphisms. Different patients with the same bone marrow failure disease often progress&#xD;
      and respond to treatment differently. This study will look at the possible role of cytokine&#xD;
      gene polymorphisms in these differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients between 2 and 80 years old who have participated in an NHLBI Hematology Branch&#xD;
      treatment protocol for acquired aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or pure red cell&#xD;
      aplasia are recruited to participate in this study. Blood collected and stored at the time of&#xD;
      screening for the treatment protocol will be tested for cytokine gene polymorphisms. No&#xD;
      additional tests, procedures, or treatments are involved in this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The NHLBI Hematology Branch is investigating features that may affect the clinical course of&#xD;
      bone marrow failure patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are particularly interested in identifying factors, which determine treatment response and&#xD;
      outcome. Cytokines are biological mediators of the immune response. In a normal population&#xD;
      there is considerable variation in the precise sequence of the genes which control cytokine&#xD;
      production (Cytokine Gene Polymorphism or CGP). As a consequence individuals differ in the&#xD;
      quality of the immune response they mount against self or foreign antigens. Since the bone&#xD;
      marrow failure disorders aplastic anemia and myelodysplastic syndrome involve auto-immune&#xD;
      suppression of marrow function, it is important to discover whether there are any recurrent&#xD;
      patterns of cytokine production in these disorders which may contribute to the marrow&#xD;
      failure. This can be done by studying the sequences of the genes that control cytokine&#xD;
      production to find out whether there are any recurrent gene patterns in the diseases studied.&#xD;
      In addition we need to understand why some patients fail to respond to immunosuppressive&#xD;
      treatments. By comparing CGP in responders and non-responders we may be able to find patterns&#xD;
      of cytokine production that are favorable or unfavorable for response. Better understanding&#xD;
      of CGPs in marrow failure syndromes should make it possible to improve the outcome for&#xD;
      patients who fail immune suppression by using drugs which block specific cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      None of these polymorphisms are associated with known clinical disease to be classifiable as&#xD;
      a 'genetic defect'. All testing will be done on samples collected and stored for research&#xD;
      purposes from consenting bone marrow failure subjects who have or will be participating on&#xD;
      Hematology Branch research protocols.&#xD;
