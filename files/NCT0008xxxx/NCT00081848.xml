    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and effects of vaccine treatment plus radiation to the&#xD;
      liver in patients with solid tumors that have spread to the liver. The vaccine treatment&#xD;
      consists of three parts: 1) a &quot;priming vaccine&quot; called rV-CEA(6D)-TRICOM, made from vaccinia&#xD;
      virus; 2) a &quot;boosting vaccine&quot; called rF-CEA(6D)-TRICOM), made from fowlpox virus; and 3) a&#xD;
      fowlpox virus injected with DNA for GM-CSF, a chemical that boosts the immune system, called&#xD;
      rF-GM-CSF. Human DNA is inserted into the priming and boosting vaccine viruses to cause&#xD;
      production of proteins that enhance immune activity and also to produce carcinoembryonic&#xD;
      antigen (CEA) - a protein that is normally produced by the patient's tumor cells. The study&#xD;
      also uses radiation, because laboratory and animal studies show that low doses of radiation&#xD;
      to tumors that produce CEA make the tumor more sensitive to the effects of the vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older who have a solid tumor that has spread to the liver may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Candidates must have had at least one course of chemotherapy for&#xD;
      metastatic disease and their tumor must produce CEA. Candidates are screened with a medical&#xD;
      history and physical examination; blood and urine tests, test of pathology slides from&#xD;
      surgery to determine the presence of the CEA marker, imaging studies to assess the extent of&#xD;
      tumor, and an electrocardiogram (and cardiologic evaluation, if clinically indicated).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive the priming vaccination on study day 1. After 3 weeks and then again&#xD;
      every 2 weeks for 2 months (study days 21, 35, 49 and 63), they receive a boosting vaccine.&#xD;
      All vaccines are injected under the skin. With every vaccination they also receive an&#xD;
      injection of rF-GM-CSF to increase the number of immune cells at the vaccination site. The&#xD;
      day after each of the first four boosting vaccinations, patients undergo 4 consecutive days&#xD;
      of radiation to the tumor in the liver (study days 22-25, 36-39, 50-53 and 64-67). Patients&#xD;
      may continue treatment with monthly booster vaccinations (without further radiation therapy)&#xD;
      as long as their cancer does not get worse and they do not develop serious treatment side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are monitored for safety and treatment response with the following tests and&#xD;
      procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests and clinic visits every 2 to 4 weeks to monitor liver, kidney, and&#xD;
           other organ function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imaging studies to assess the tumor around study day 91 and every 2 months after that&#xD;
           while on the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Apheresis (a procedure for collecting immune cells called lymphocytes) - Apheresis is&#xD;
           done before the first vaccination on study day 1 and again around study day 91. For this&#xD;
           procedure, blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein. The blood circulates&#xD;
           through a machine that separates it into its components by spinning, and the lymphocytes&#xD;
           are extracted. The rest of the blood is returned to the patient through the same needle.&#xD;
           The collected lymphocytes are studied to measure the immune response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Liver biopsy (optional) - This test is done once before starting radiation treatment and&#xD;
           again around 3 to 7 days after completing the first dose of radiation. The biopsy&#xD;
           provides information on the type of cancer, the level of CEA produced by the tumor, and&#xD;
           the immune status of the tumor. For this procedure, the skin over the liver is numbed&#xD;
           with an anesthetic, a needle is placed in the liver tumor, and a small sample of tumor&#xD;
           is withdrawn through the needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After treatment is completed, patients are monitored for up to 15 years, including yearly&#xD;
      medical histories and physical examinations for 5 years following their last vaccination.&#xD;
      Information beyond 5 years is collected once a year by telephone&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A phase I clinical trial with this same vaccine alone was associated with stable disease&#xD;
           (at least 4 months) in 40% of patients and 1 pathologic complete response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiation therapy upregulates Fas on tumor cells allowing for easier killing by antigen&#xD;
           specific activated T cells. Dominant negative fas transfected tumor cells demonstrated&#xD;
           the anti-tumor effects were fas mediated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiation has been shown to up-regulate ICAM, tumor associated antigens and MHC class I&#xD;
           on human tumor cell lines in vitro.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TRICOM vaccines act synergistically with radiation in tumor treatment models.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiation therapy at the doses we propose appears to have a favorable safety profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical trials using PSA vaccine shows that local radiation of tumor does not inhibit&#xD;
           vaccine efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1: Safety of the combination of a CEA based vaccine and radiation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2: clinical response&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2: Immunohistochemistry - (FAS, MHC, p53 and CEA on tumor before and after radiation&#xD;
           therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2: Immunological response (ELISPOT assay).&#xD;
&#xD;
