    <textblock>
      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of intratumoral (in the tumor) PV701 in treating&#xD;
      patients who have advanced or recurrent unresectable squamous cell carcinoma (cancer) of the&#xD;
      head and neck. Vaccines made from a specially-modified virus such as PV701 may make the body&#xD;
      build an immune response to kill tumor cells while leaving normal cells undamaged. Injecting&#xD;
      PV701 directly into the tumor may cause a stronger immune response and kill more tumor cells&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PV701 administered by direct intratumoral&#xD;
      injection in patients with advanced or recurrent unresectable squamous cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
      head and neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the toxicity of intratumoral PV701 in these patients. III. Determine response&#xD;
      rate and time to progression at the injection site in patients treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive intratumoral PV701 once weekly for&#xD;
      3 weeks. Courses repeat every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of PV701 until the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2&#xD;
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, at&#xD;
      least 6 evaluable patients are treated at that dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-10&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
