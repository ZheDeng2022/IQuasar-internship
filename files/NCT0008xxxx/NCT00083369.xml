      To characterize the genetic basis of the variable response of triglycerides to two&#xD;
      environmental contexts, one that raises triglycerides (dietary fat), and one that lowers&#xD;
      triglycerides (fenofibrate treatment.)&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertriglyceridemia is emerging as an important predictor of atherosclerosis, and recent&#xD;
      evidence suggests related phenotypes of triglycerides (TGs), such as TG remnant particles and&#xD;
      small lactate dehydrogenase (LDL) particles, are particularly atherogenic. There is&#xD;
      considerable variation in the response of TGs and related phenotypes to the environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is in response to a Request for Applications (RFA) entitled &quot; Interaction of Genes&#xD;
      and Environment in Shaping Risk Factors for Heart, Lung, Blood, and Sleep Disorders&quot;. The RFA&#xD;
      was released in October, 2001.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements will be collected before and after a dietary fat challenge to assess&#xD;
      postprandial TGs and related atherogenic phenotypes (VLDL TGs, chylomicron TGs, TG remnant&#xD;
      particles, high-density lipoprotein(HDL) and low density lipids (LDL) particle sizes, total&#xD;
      cholesterol, LDL-C, and HDL-C). In families with 2 or more members in a sibship with high TGs&#xD;
      (&gt;= 130 mg/dl), the authors will conduct a short-term, placebo-controlled, randomized trial&#xD;
      of fenofibrate in all willing and eligible family members (anticipated sample size = 1,200).&#xD;
      A two-period crossover design will be executed with a 2-week washout between two 3-week&#xD;
      treatment periods (placebo or micronized fenofibrate, 160 mg). About 1,000 family members&#xD;
      have a Marshfield genome marker set available as part of national Heart Lung and Blood&#xD;
      (NHLBI) FHS; the remaining 1,400 will be typed using the same marker set. They will conduct&#xD;
      genome-wide linkage analyses using state-of-the-art methods to localize novel genetic loci&#xD;
      contributing to TG response in the context of fat loading and fenofibrate treatment. They&#xD;
      will type 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ten candidate genes known to&#xD;
      contribute to the response of TGs to dietary fat and fenofibrate, and create haplotypes for&#xD;
      association studies. They will use combinatorial partitioning methods and neural networks to&#xD;
      test association of the individual SNPs and haplotypes with response to the two environmental&#xD;
      interventions. The identification of genetic loci that predict TG response in the presence of&#xD;
      two disparate contexts, fat loading and fibrate therapy, may provide insights into genetic&#xD;
      pathways (a) predisposing to hypertriglyceridemia, ultimately leading to avenues for primary&#xD;
      prevention, and (b) predicting response to TG lowering, leading to new drug targets for&#xD;
      hypertriglyceridemia.&#xD;
