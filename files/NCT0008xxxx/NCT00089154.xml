  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well apolizumab works in treating patients with chronic&#xD;
      lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma. Monoclonal antibodies such as apolizumab&#xD;
      can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them&#xD;
      without harming normal cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the response rate and progression-free survival rate in patients with relapsed&#xD;
      or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or noncontiguous stage II or stage III or IV&#xD;
      small lymphocytic lymphoma treated with apolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the safety of this drug, in terms of the frequency and severity of&#xD;
      treatment-related adverse events, in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine clinical response to apolizumab varies by genetic subtype of CLL. II. Determine&#xD;
      if pharmacokinetic clearance is truly predicted by 1D10 antigen density on the individual&#xD;
      patient CLL cell and how apolizumab clearance correlates with response and selected&#xD;
      toxicities observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the importance of reactive oxygen species and specific signaling pathways&#xD;
      in promoting apolizumab-mediated apoptosis in vitro and in vivo in primary CLL cells and if&#xD;
      this correlates with clinical response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the cellular properties which convey resistance to apolizumab in CLL in&#xD;
      vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive apolizumab IV over 2-4 hours on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22,&#xD;
      24, and 26 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed at 1 week, at 1 and 2 months, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every&#xD;
      6 months for 3 years.&#xD;
