      This study will explore brain function related to depressive symptoms and will examine DNA&#xD;
      for genes that may be involved in depressive disorders, particularly genes that regulate&#xD;
      synthesis and metabolism of the brain neurotransmitter catecholamine. It will compare&#xD;
      findings in patients with major depressive disorders who are in remission with those in&#xD;
      normal, healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with remitted major depressive disorders and healthy normal volunteers between 18&#xD;
      and 60 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a&#xD;
      psychiatric and medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, and blood and urine&#xD;
      tests. Participants undergo the following tests and procedures in up to eight visits to the&#xD;
      NIH Clinical Center:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Memory Tasks and Problem Solving and Brain Imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are tested with measurements of intelligence or memory ability. They also undergo&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a test that uses a magnetic field and radio waves to&#xD;
      produce images of the brain. For this procedure, the patient lies on a table that is moved&#xD;
      into the scanner (a narrow cylinder), and wears earplugs to muffle loud knocking and thumping&#xD;
      sounds that occur during the scanning process. The MRI lasts about 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Catecholamine Depletion Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, subjects take capsules containing either AMPT (a drug that temporarily&#xD;
      reduces brain catecholamine activity) or a placebo (lactose capsules, which do not affect&#xD;
      brain catecholamine activity) at 9 a.m., 2 p.m., and 7 p.m. on one visit and return the next&#xD;
      day to take additional capsules at 7 a.m. and noon. In addition to the study medication,&#xD;
      subjects keep a low-monoamine diet (e.g., no chocolate, cheese, smoked meats, and various&#xD;
      other foods that will be enumerated) and do not smoke, drink alcohol, or take in food or&#xD;
      drink containing caffeine. After taking all the study capsules, the subjects have positron&#xD;
      emission tomography (PET) and functional MRI (fMRI) scans, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  fMRI: While lying in the MRI scanner, the subject performs a monetary reward task that&#xD;
           is somewhat like playing a computer video game for money. The amount of cash the subject&#xD;
           can win depends on his or her performance. It is possible to lose money that was&#xD;
           previously won, if performance declines. This portion of the study provides information&#xD;
           on how the brain processes reward and about the role of catecholamines in this process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PET: The subject is injected in the arm with a glucose solution that has a radioactive&#xD;
           substance attached that can be detected by the PET scanner. During the scan, the subject&#xD;
           looks at photographs of faces on a computer screen and is asked to tell the gender of&#xD;
           the persons. This test shows brain blood flow and measures brain glucose (sugar)&#xD;
           metabolism, which reflects brain activity. At the end of the scan, subjects are asked&#xD;
           about their mood and general well being. They return to the Clinical Center the&#xD;
           following day for and evaluation of their emotional state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The catecholamine depletion study is repeated a second time 14 days or more after the first.&#xD;
      Subjects who received AMPT capsules for the first study take lactose capsules for the second&#xD;
      study, and vice-versa.&#xD;

      The depressive and anhedonic response precipitated by CD raises the possibility that&#xD;
      dysfunction of the dopamine system is a stable, sometimes latent characteristic of MDD.&#xD;
      Following this line of reasoning, central catecholamine dysfunction as evinced by CD may be&#xD;
      equally salient in a subset of unaffected relatives who are at genetic risk for developing&#xD;
      the disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to extend the phase I project to unaffected relatives of BD and MDD patients in order&#xD;
      to evaluate sensitivity to CD as an endophenotype of MDD and BD. In order to maximize our&#xD;
      statistical power, we will be recruiting equal numbers healthy low and high-risk relatives.&#xD;
      Here, risk is defined on the basis of chronological age (see below for more detail).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, it has recently become feasible to conduct genome-wide association studies and&#xD;
      quantify the burden of risk alleles carried by an individual. Certainly, the identity of&#xD;
      these risk alleles remains unknown or unproven. Nevertheless, Francis McMahon's group, with&#xD;
      whom we are collaborating, have identified upwards of 20 common risk variants in two&#xD;
      independent samples. Individuals carrying 19 or more of these risk alleles were found to be 4&#xD;
      times more likely to be cases than controls. This approach may provide us with another method&#xD;
      of quantifying genetic risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endophenotypic status of sensitivity to CD will be evaluated with psychometric&#xD;
      instruments, FDG PET, and an fMRI-coupled appetitive learning task. We now have access to a&#xD;
      high resolution PET scanner (High Resolution Research Tomograph) that will enable us to study&#xD;
      hitherto irresolvable structures of importance such as the habenula and peri-aqueductal gray&#xD;
      matter (PAG) in addition to previously implicated regions such as the ventral striatum and&#xD;
      OFC. Analysis of the metabolic activity of these regions under sham and CD conditions in both&#xD;
      remitted MDD and relatives of BD and MDD patients is of great theoretical import. So to is&#xD;
      identifying regions of the brain involved in reward response that are selectively impacted by&#xD;
      CD, a question that we hope to answer through the use of the fMRI-coupled appetitive learning&#xD;
      task.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        MDD Sample: 40 subjects (ages 18-45) with remitted MDD will be selected. MDD is defined by&#xD;
        the DSM-IV criteria, and one of the following additional criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. history of two or more major depressive episodes, or&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. history of one major depressive episode and a family history for major depression.&#xD;
             Remission is defined as a period of at least three months during which the subject has&#xD;
             not taken any antidepressant agents, with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS;&#xD;
             21-item) scores in the non-depressed range (less than 8), and with no more than one&#xD;
             clinically significant depressive symptom.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Unaffected MDD Relative Sample:&#xD;
&#xD;
        40 healthy relatives of MDD probands (ages 18-45) will be recruited. Subjects will be&#xD;
        screened to ensure that they have no history of psychiatric illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Unaffected BD Relative Sample:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy relatives of BD probands (ages 18-45) will be recruited. Subjects will be screened&#xD;
        to ensure that they have no history of psychiatric illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy Control Samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Healthy subjects (ages 18-45) without a known personal or first-degree family history of&#xD;
        psychiatric disorders in first-degree relatives will be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any subject who appears incapable of providing informed consent will be excluded from&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who take effective antidepressant medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must not have taken antidepressant or other medications likely to alter&#xD;
             monoamine neurochemistry or cerebrovascular and cardiovascular function for at least 3&#xD;
             months prior to the studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. psychosis to the extent that the ability to provide informed consent is in doubt&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. medical or neurological illnesses likely to affect physiology or anatomy, i.e.&#xD;
                  hypertension, cardiovascular disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. a history of drug (including benzodiazepines [BZD]) or alcohol abuse within 1&#xD;
                  year or a lifetime history of alcohol or drug dependence (DSM IV criteria) longer&#xD;
                  than 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. current pregnancy (as documented by pregnancy testing at screening or at days of&#xD;
                  the challenge studies)&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. current breast feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. smokers&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. serious suicidal ideation or behavior&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. general MRI exclusion criteria (e.g., subjects with metallic implants that are&#xD;
                  ferromagnetic will be excluded from the fMRI scanning). Subjects must exhibit no&#xD;
                  or only moderate alcohol use. Subjects with current excessive use of alcohol&#xD;
                  (greater than 4 ounces/day for men and greater than 3 ounces/day for women) are&#xD;
                  ineligible for participation, as such drug use confounds the results&#xD;
&#xD;
               9. smokers are ineligible because of the evidence for interactions between nicotine&#xD;
                  and depression, and the possibility of withdrawal symptoms that may affect&#xD;
                  behavioral and neural responses to CD&#xD;
&#xD;
              10. history of suicidality and other axis I diagnoses beside major depressive&#xD;
                  disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
              11. lactose intolerance&#xD;
&#xD;
              12. women not using a reliable contraception method. Finally subjects who have had an&#xD;
                  upper respiratory tract infection in the last week will be excluded as this may&#xD;
                  impact sense of smell.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects beyond age 45&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals whose first major depressive episodes arose after other medical or&#xD;
             psychiatric conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects showing significant side effects during AMPT depletion such as dystonic&#xD;
             reactions will receive adequate treatment and will be excluded from the study&#xD;
