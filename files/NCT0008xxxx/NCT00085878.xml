  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study of SB-485232. Subjects will receive&#xD;
      SB-485232 administered as subcutaneous injections daily for 14 days. Dose escalation&#xD;
      (enrollment into the next cohort) cannot occur until all three subjects have completed the&#xD;
      previous cohort; 5 doses will be tested. An additional dosing regimen has been added to&#xD;
      evaluate higher doses given twice weekly for 7 weeks. Therefore, the full evaluation period&#xD;
      for each patient will extend out to approximately eleven weeks after the first day of&#xD;
      SB-485232 dosing.&#xD;
