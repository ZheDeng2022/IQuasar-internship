  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the long-term effects, particularly on bone metabolism, of the drug&#xD;
      tenofovir DF in children with HIV infection. Tenofovir DF is approved for treating&#xD;
      HIV-infected adults, but its use in children has not yet been approved. The drug may be&#xD;
      helpful for children who have been treated with many other drugs and still have detectable&#xD;
      HIV in their blood despite ongoing therapy. In a previous study, many children given&#xD;
      tenofovir DF responded well, with increases in T-cell counts and decreases in viral load.&#xD;
      However, many children also experienced bone thinning. This study will explore the problem of&#xD;
      bone thinning in children taking tenofovir DF in combination with highly active&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (HAART).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients from 4 to 20 years old who are taking tenofovir DF or for whom&#xD;
      tenofovir DF treatment has been recommended may be eligible for this 3-year study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants take tenofovir DF every day in addition to their antiretroviral therapy. They&#xD;
      have frequent follow-up visits for tests and procedures as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study days 0, 2, and 4: blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening and every study visit starting day 6: Physical exam, medical history, blood&#xD;
           and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline and every 48 weeks: Dental and eye examinations, kidney ultrasound, tuberculin&#xD;
           skin testing, chest x-ray, electrocardiogram and echocardiogram, computed tomography&#xD;
           (CT) scan, neuropsychological testing and neurologic assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The bone age hand x-rays are done every 24 weeks, unless the growth plates are fused&#xD;
           (i.e. the child has stopped growing)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DEXAs are done at 0, 12, 24 weeks and every 24 weeks thereafter. Dual energy x-ray&#xD;
           absorptionometry (DEXA) scan is used to assess bone density. The patient lies still on a&#xD;
           table while the spine and hip are scanned using a small amount of radiation. Only the&#xD;
           spine and hip are scanned in the DEXA scan test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline and week 24: Optional bone biopsy. Some patients are asked to undergo a bone&#xD;
           biopsy to better understand the effect of Tenofovir DF on bone. For the procedure, the&#xD;
           child is given a sedative. The skin over the hipbone is numbed with a small needle, a&#xD;
           small incision is made and a larger needle is inserted into the bone. Some of the bone&#xD;
           tissue is withdrawn through the needle and the incision is closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Possible lumbar puncture (spinal tap): This optional procedure analyzes cerebrospinal&#xD;
           fluid (CSF), the fluid that bathes the brain and spinal cord. The patient is given a&#xD;
           local anesthetic and a needle is inserted into the space between the bones in the lower&#xD;
           back where the CSF circulates below the spinal cord. A small amount of fluid is&#xD;
           collected through the needle. There is no specific schedule for this procedure if the&#xD;
           patient opts for it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are benefiting from tenofovir DF therapy but show signs of bone effects are&#xD;
      offered treatment with pamidronate (Aredia), a drug used to treat hypercalcemia (too much&#xD;
      calcium in the blood). Patients who stop taking tenofovir DF because of bone toxicity&#xD;
      continue to be followed on the regular study schedule. Those who stop the drug for toxicity&#xD;
      other than bone toxicity or for toxicity not related to tenofovir DF are followed every 4&#xD;
      weeks until their laboratory test results improve.&#xD;

      Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) was approved for the treatment of HIV-infected adults in&#xD;
      October 2001. In November 2001, we began enrollment to our phase I/II study of tenofovir DF&#xD;
      in HIV-infected children (02-C-0006). That study has completed enrollment. The virologic and&#xD;
      immunologic responses seen on that study in a group of heavily treatment-experienced children&#xD;
      with multidrug resistant HIV were surprisingly good. The drug was well tolerated, but&#xD;
      significant decreases in bone mineral density were seen in a minority of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the current study we will enroll and systematically investigate HIV-infected children&#xD;
      for whom tenofovir DF is being used as part of salvage combination HIV therapy. The primary&#xD;
      objective of the study is to characterize the change in bone mineral density (BMD), as&#xD;
      measured by lumbar spine dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), during and following&#xD;
      treatment with tenofovir DF-containing antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected children. The&#xD;
      study will enroll 3 cohorts of children: 1) HIV-infected children about to start a tenofovir&#xD;
      DF-containing antiretroviral regimen, 2) HIV-infected children already on tenofovir DF with&#xD;
      available baseline DEXA results, and 3) HIV-infected children already on tenofovir DF but&#xD;
      without baseline DEXA results who will come here for investigations of bone metabolism.&#xD;
      Studies of bone metabolism will include periodic measurements of serum and urine calcium and&#xD;
      phosphorus, PTH and vitamin D levels, bone resorption markers (urinary collagen cross-linked&#xD;
      N-telopeptide and free deoxypyridinoline), bone formation markers (serum osteocalcin and bone&#xD;
      specific alkaline phosphatase), IGF-1 levels, bone age, and DEXA scans. Patients about to&#xD;
      start tenofovir DF (cohort 1) will be offered the option of having a transiliac crest core&#xD;
      bone biopsy with tetracycline labeling performed at baseline and at 6 months to assess static&#xD;
      and dynamic parameters of bone quality and turnover (histomorphometry). Subjects with&#xD;
      substantial presumed tenofovir DF-related bone toxicity who are deriving benefit from their&#xD;
      tenofovir DF-containing antiretroviral drug regimen will be offered the option of pamidronate&#xD;
      therapy. The effects of pamidronate treatment on bone toxicity associated with tenofovir DF&#xD;
      in these patients will be assessed in an exploratory fashion. It is expected that up to 40&#xD;
      patients with baseline BMD measurements will be enrolled onto this protocol. An additional 10&#xD;
      patients who are undergoing tenofovir DF treatment but who did not receive baseline BMD&#xD;
      measurements will also be permitted to enroll in order to contribute to the data used to&#xD;
      characterize changes in toxicity.&#xD;
