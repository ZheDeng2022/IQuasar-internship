  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine how different brain areas are involved in the perception of rhythmic&#xD;
      patterns and the performance of rhythmic movements. Patients with certain types of brain&#xD;
      diseases, such as Parkinson's disease and some types of stroke, may have difficulty&#xD;
      performing rhythmic movements, such as finger tapping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy, right-handed volunteers between 21 and 65 years of age may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. Candidates with visual, motor or hearing problems are excluded, as are musicians and&#xD;
      pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will come to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center for up to&#xD;
      six sessions of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. MRI uses a strong&#xD;
      magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of body organs and tissues. The scanner is a&#xD;
      metal cylinder surrounded by a magnetic field. During the MRI, the subject lies still for up&#xD;
      to 20 minutes at a time on a table in the cylinder and wears earplugs to muffle loud knocking&#xD;
      noises that occur with the electrical switching of the magnetic fields. He or she can&#xD;
      communicate with the MRI staff through a microphone at all times during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For fMRI, images are obtained while the subject performs a task, such as hearing sounds or&#xD;
      moving a finger. The machine detects changes in brain movement that are involved in&#xD;
      performing the task. The tasks are explained, and subjects can practice them before entering&#xD;
      the scanner.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rhythmic movements, such as finger tapping, are relatively simple. However, many brain areas&#xD;
      including motor, somatosensory, premotor and prefrontal cortex, supplementary motor area,&#xD;
      basal ganglia, cerebellum, etc. have been reported to be activated during rhythmic movements.&#xD;
      Patients with lesions located in the extrapyramidal or cerebellar system, such as patients&#xD;
      with Parkinson's disease, cerebellar ataxia or stroke with a lesion in these systems, have&#xD;
      difficulties in performing rhythmic movements. Timing deficits after basal ganglia or&#xD;
      cerebellar damage could also be due to abnormalities in interconnecting cortical systems&#xD;
      commonly associated with these processes. Few studies have examined involvement of cerebral&#xD;
      cortex in time perception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to detect the brain areas associated with three hypothesized&#xD;
      processes associated with rhythm perception and generation: (1) perception of external&#xD;
      rhythmic stimulation, (2) internal rhythm generation and (3) execution of rhythmic movement.&#xD;
      To investigate whether the process of rhythm perception is common across sensory modalities,&#xD;
      we will use auditory and visual stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will be conducted using normal adult volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we will examine the brain activity of subjects&#xD;
      while they will hear or watch rhythmic stimulation and press buttons rhythmically with their&#xD;
      fingers. A series of experiments will be designed to demonstrate the hypothesized three&#xD;
      processes separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The brain activity correlated with experimental conditions and behavioral data (the timing&#xD;
      error of button press to the corresponding rhythmic stimulation) will be collected and&#xD;
      analyzed by using statistical parametric mapping (SPM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings we expect to obtain with this experiment will contribute to basic knowledge for&#xD;
      better understanding of the pathophysiology of the disturbance of perception and generation&#xD;
      of rhythm in patients with neurological disorders, and give theoretical background for&#xD;
      repetitive, rhythmically patterned movement training in neurorehabilitation.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Fifty healthy, right-handed adult (aged between 21 to 65 years old) volunteers will be&#xD;
        recruited from people who are registered as HMCS normal volunteers. All subjects&#xD;
        participating in MR studies should have a valid Clinical Center Medical Record Number.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Female subjects of childbearing potential will have a pregnancy test and a specific&#xD;
        interview prior to the study to ensure that pregnant subjects will not participate in the&#xD;
        study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with implanted devices such as pacemakers, medication pumps or defibrillators,&#xD;
        metal in the cranium except mouth, intracardiac lines, history of shrapnel injury or any&#xD;
        other condition/device that may be contraindicated or prevent the acquisition of MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant female. A pregnancy test will be performed within 24 hours preceding each MRI and&#xD;
        if the result is positive, that subject will not be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with claustrophobia&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with any visual, motor or hearing difficulties&#xD;
&#xD;
        Musicians&#xD;
