      This study will evaluate the effects of an experimental drug called ACP-103 on Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease symptoms and on dyskinesias (involuntary movements) that develop as a result of&#xD;
      long-term levodopa treatment. ACP-103 changes the spread of certain brain signals that are&#xD;
      affected in patients with Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with relatively advanced Parkinson's disease and dyskinesias who are between 30 and&#xD;
      80 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a complete&#xD;
      medical history and physical examination, neurological evaluation, blood and urine tests, and&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG). A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, CT scan, and chest&#xD;
      x-ray may be done if medically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in the study will, if possible, stop taking all antiparkinsonian&#xD;
      medications for one month (2 months for Selegiline) before the study begins and throughout&#xD;
      its duration. Exceptions are Sinemet (levodopa/carbidopa), Mirapex (pramipexole) and Requip&#xD;
      (ropinirole).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Levodopa Dose Finding&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the screening evaluations, patients are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for 2 to 3&#xD;
      days to undergo a levodopa &quot;dose-finding&quot; procedure. For this test, patients stop taking&#xD;
      Sinemet and instead have levodopa infused through a vein. During the infusion, the drug dose&#xD;
      is increased slowly until either 1) parkinsonian symptoms improve, 2) unacceptable side&#xD;
      effects occur, or 3) the maximum study dose is reached. Side effects are monitored closely&#xD;
      during the infusions, and parkinsonian symptoms are evaluated frequently during and after the&#xD;
      infusions. The infusions usually begin early in the morning and continue until evening. Once&#xD;
      the infusion is finished, patients resume taking their regular oral Sinemet dose. The&#xD;
      infusions are repeated once a week during 1-day inpatient evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomly assigned to take either ACP-103 followed by placebo (a look-alike pill&#xD;
      with no active ingredient) once a week for 10 weeks or vice versa (placebo followed by&#xD;
      ACP-103). Patients are admitted to the Clinical Center for each dose. During this admission&#xD;
      they have a brief medical examination, blood and urine tests, ECG, and review of symptoms or&#xD;
      changes in their condition. They also have an infusion of levodopa (see above) at the&#xD;
      previously determined optimal rate. Parkinsonism symptoms and dyskinesias are evaluated every&#xD;
      30 minutes for about 6 hours. At the end of the infusions and ratings, patients are&#xD;
      discharged home with their regular Parkinson's medications until the following visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two weeks after their final dose of ACP-103 or placebo, patients are contact by telephone for&#xD;
      a follow-up safety check. At that time, the investigator may ask the patient to return to the&#xD;
      clinic for closer evaluation.&#xD;

      Introduction: In Parkinson's disease (PD), levodopa-induced dyskinesias and motor&#xD;
      fluctuations are frequent, disabling complications. Therefore, it is imperative to find&#xD;
      nondopaminergic approaches to the palliation of parkinsonian signs. Previously, we&#xD;
      demonstrated that drugs that block 5HT2A receptors benefit motor dysfunction in parkinsonian&#xD;
      animals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To test our hypothesis that blockade of serotonin 2A/2C receptors (5HT2A/C) will&#xD;
      lessen the severity of parkinsonian signs and levodopa-associated motor response&#xD;
      complications in PD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In a placebo-controlled, proof-of-principle study, the effect of the 5HT2A/C&#xD;
      receptor inverse agonist ACP-103 on levodopa induced motor complications and parkinsonian&#xD;
      signs will be assessed in up to 20 patients with moderately advanced Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
      Efficacy will be assessed through the use of validated motor function scales. Safety will be&#xD;
      monitored by means of frequent clinical evaluations and laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks and benefits: Risks involved in this study are a minor increase over minimal risks and&#xD;
      are deemed reasonable in relation to potential benefits. This investigation should lead to a&#xD;
      better understanding of the pathophysiology and treatment of levodopa-induced motor&#xD;
      complications in PD.&#xD;
