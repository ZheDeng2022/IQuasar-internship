      This study will evaluate: 1) whether computed tomography (CT) scanning is better than regular&#xD;
      x-rays for measuring changes in the stiffness, or fusion, of the spine in patients with&#xD;
      ankylosing spondylitis; and 2) if CT can be used to determine how fast extra bone forms in&#xD;
      the spine of these patients. Better ways to measure spinal fusion are needed to be able to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of medicines in slowing or stopping its progression. CT uses&#xD;
      x-rays to provide detailed pictures of the inside of the body and are valuable for detecting&#xD;
      spinal abnormalities because of the precision with which it can show these structures. For&#xD;
      the procedure, the patient lies on a table that moves into a large, donut-shaped scanner that&#xD;
      can move around the body to take pictures at different angles, which are viewed on a computer&#xD;
      monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with ankylosing spondylitis who are not currently taking&#xD;
      or planning to receive treatment with anti-TNF alpha medications (etanercept, infliximab,&#xD;
      adalimumab) for 1 year may be eligible for this study. Participants have eight clinic visits,&#xD;
      scheduled at study entry and at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 48 months, at the NIH Clinical&#xD;
      Center for the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical assessment (all visits) - includes medical history and physical examination,&#xD;
           measurement of spine flexibility with a tape measure and protractor, symptoms&#xD;
           questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests for measures of inflammation, including red blood cell sedimentation rate&#xD;
           and C-reactive protein level (all visits)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine pregnancy test in women of child-bearing age (visits 1, 4, 7, 8)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  X-rays of the pelvis, low back, and neck (visits 1, 4, 7)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  X-ray of the low back (visit 8)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT scan of the low back (visits 1, 4, 7)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the low back (visits 1, 4) - MRI combines a powerful&#xD;
           magnet with an advanced computer system and radio waves to produce accurate, detailed&#xD;
           pictures of organs and tissues. The patient lies on a table in a narrow cylinder&#xD;
           containing a magnetic field, wearing earplugs to muffle loud noises that occur with&#xD;
           electrical switching of the magnetic fields. He or she can speak with a staff member via&#xD;
           an intercom system at all times during the procedure. During the scan, a contrast dye&#xD;
           (gadolinium) is injected into the bloodstream through a catheter (plastic tube inserted&#xD;
           in a vein) to brighten the images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, participants will complete a symptoms questionnaire by mail every 4 months for 2&#xD;
      years between visits 7 and 8.&#xD;

      Spinal fusion is the clinical, radiological, and pathological hallmark of ankylosing&#xD;
      spondylitis (AS). However, spinal fusion occurs slowly in AS. Serial radiographs rarely show&#xD;
      changes over 2 years, and often 5 or more years are needed to demonstrate progression of&#xD;
      spinal fusion. Methods that are more sensitive to changes in the extent of spinal fusion than&#xD;
      plain radiographs are needed to test if any treatments can slow or halt spinal fusion in AS.&#xD;
      The need for an improved measure of spinal fusion is heightened now that several new&#xD;
      medications are available that have the potential to markedly decrease spinal inflammation in&#xD;
      AS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this pilot study is to test whether measurement of bone mineral density, bone&#xD;
      volume, or bone mass at the annulus fibrosis of lumbar disc spaces by computed tomography&#xD;
      (CT) can provide a reliable, valid, and sensitive measure of spinal fusion in patients with&#xD;
      AS. Fifty-five participants will have lumbar spine CT scans at baseline, 12 months, and 24&#xD;
      months, lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and 12 months, and spinal&#xD;
      radiographs at baseline, 12 months, 24 months, and 48 months. In addition, clinical&#xD;
      assessments will be done every 4 months during the first 24 months. An option to perform only&#xD;
      the baseline studies is also possible. No treatment is provided in the protocol. Reliability&#xD;
      of image processing will be tested on repeated measurements of baseline scans. Reliability&#xD;
      will also be assessed with repeat CT scans on up to 10 participants. Construct validity will&#xD;
      be tested by correlation of CT measures with scores of plain radiographs, lumbar magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging, and spinal range of motion. The sensitivity to change of the CT measures&#xD;
      over 12 months and 24 months will be compared to those of two scoring systems based on plain&#xD;
      radiographs.&#xD;
