  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the clinical pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      profiles of the 2 doses of VELCADE (bortezomib) for Injection. Patients who volunteer to&#xD;
      participate in the pharmacogenetic portion of the study, an additional blood sample will be&#xD;
      collected before the Cycle 1 Day 1 dose of bortezomib to assess the genotype of drug&#xD;
      metabolizing enzymes.&#xD;
