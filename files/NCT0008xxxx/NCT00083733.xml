      This study will collect, analyze, and compare genes and proteins in normal breast tissue with&#xD;
      those in various tissues from women with breast cancer to look for changes that are unique to&#xD;
      breast cancer cells. Information about these differences may lead to more effective breast&#xD;
      cancer treatments with fewer side effects. The study has the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To define the molecular (genetic and protein) profile of normal breast tissue from pre-&#xD;
           and post-menopausal women of different ages and who have had varying numbers of children&#xD;
           (or no children), and who are in different phases of the menstrual cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To define the molecular profile of primary breast tumors and tumors that have&#xD;
           metastasized (spread) beyond the primary site&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize breast cancer stem cells and establish cell lines from the pleural fluid&#xD;
           (fluid around the lungs) of women with metastatic breast cancer. (A cell line is a&#xD;
           collection of cells that are grown in the laboratory from an original tissue specimen.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following women may be eligible for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women who are undergoing cosmetic breast surgery that requires removal of some breast&#xD;
           tissue (e.g., breast reduction surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women 18 years of age or older who are undergoing a biopsy or other surgical procedure&#xD;
           to sample or remove a known or suspected primary or metastatic breast tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women 18 years of age or older who are undergoing pleurocentesis, a procedure to remove&#xD;
           fluid from around the lung that is suspected or known to be caused by spread of breast&#xD;
           cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the required procedure (e.g., surgery, biopsy, or pleurocentesis) and&#xD;
      provide information that may include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age, race/ethnicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age at first menstrual period (menarche)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age at first pregnancy and age when the first child was born&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age at menopause&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Information about primary breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Family history of breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Information on previous breast biopsies, if any, and hormones taken (birth control pills&#xD;
           or hormone replacement therapy), if any&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Copy of pathology report from procedure (surgery, biopsy, or pleurocentesis)&#xD;

      Background: Defining the molecular profile (gene and protein expression) of normal breast&#xD;
      tissue is essential to identifying markers for cellular subtypes in the normal human breast.&#xD;
      These markers could serve as biomarkers for prevention trials or represent new therapeutic&#xD;
      targets if they are also expressed in early breast cancers. The gene and protein expression&#xD;
      in normal breast tissue may be dependent on the stage of the menstrual cycle, whether the&#xD;
      woman is pre- or post-menopausal, prior pregnancy and breast feeding history, and age. The&#xD;
      molecular profile of metastatic breast tumors may differ from that of the primary tumor and&#xD;
      differ in metastases from different anatomic sites. Identification of genes/proteins unique&#xD;
      to these lesions may help identify the processes responsible for metastatic spread at a&#xD;
      molecular level and lead to the development of new molecularly targeted drugs. Similarly,&#xD;
      isolation and characterization of breast cancer stem cells could provide new approaches for&#xD;
      the treatment and prevention of breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To define the molecular profile of normal breast tissue from pre- and&#xD;
      post-menopausal women of varying age and parity (nulliparous to multiparous) and in different&#xD;
      phases of the menstrual cycle; to study the molecular profile of primary and metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer lesions; and to identify and characterize breast cancer stem cells and&#xD;
      establish cell lines from the pleural fluid of women with breast cancer and malignant pleural&#xD;
      effusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility: Women who are undergoing cosmetic breast surgery that entails resection of a&#xD;
      portion of the breast (e.g., reduction mammoplasty) and who do not have a history of breast&#xD;
      cancer; women with known or suspected breast cancer who are having a primary tumor biopsied&#xD;
      or resected or having a metastatic lesion biopsied or resected; or women with breast cancer&#xD;
      who are undergoing pleurocentesis for a suspected or known malignant pleural effusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Normal breast tissues from cosmetic breast procedures that are performed in women&#xD;
      without a history of breast cancer at Suburban Hospital will be snap frozen in liquid&#xD;
      nitrogen and sent to the NCI for storage and analysis. Demographic information will be&#xD;
      collected from the women undergoing the procedure. Similarly, a portion of biopsies obtained&#xD;
      from primary or metastatic lesions in women with suspected or known breast cancer at Suburban&#xD;
      Hospital or the NIH will be collected after materials are obtained for diagnostic purposes,&#xD;
      snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and sent to the NCI with demographic information. The&#xD;
      unneeded fluid from pleurocenteses performed in women with breast cancer and malignant&#xD;
      pleural effusions will be transported (unfrozen) to an NCI lab for immediate processing (FAC&#xD;
      sorting to isolate breast cancer stem cells). RNA will be extracted from tissues and cDNA&#xD;
      microarrays will be used to study gene expression. Proteomic analysis of normal and malignant&#xD;
      breast tissue will be studied using reverse-phase tissue lysates.&#xD;
