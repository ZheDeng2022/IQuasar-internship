      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have found that diets with higher fiber intake are associated with a reduction&#xD;
      in cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the association does not prove that dietary fiber&#xD;
      is actually responsible for lower CVD risk nor does it illuminate potential mechanisms of&#xD;
      lower risk if present. Since the diet-CVD connection is strong, and given that CVD is a major&#xD;
      contributor to morbidity and mortality, additional information would be valuable. Our&#xD;
      preliminary studies and the work of others suggest that there is a significant association&#xD;
      between C-reactive protein (CRP) and dietary fiber intake. These observations led us to the&#xD;
      following unifying hypothesis: Diets high in fiber are associated with lower levels of&#xD;
      inflammatory markers. Our long-term goal is to determine whether inflammation is a key&#xD;
      mediator in the link between fiber intake and cardiovascular disease risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three specific aims of the project are 1: To determine whether total dietary fiber and or&#xD;
      fiber supplementation is associated with levels of inflammatory markers (CRP, fibrinogen,&#xD;
      WBC) among adult participants with obesity, hypertension, or diabetes in the National Health&#xD;
      and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2000; 2: To determine whether 3 weeks on a diet&#xD;
      naturally high in fiber (30g/day), or on a diet high in fiber through supplementation, will&#xD;
      significantly reduce inflammatory markers compared to a diet low in fiber, in a clinical&#xD;
      trial among 30 lean and 30 obese adult hypertensive volunteers; and 3: To determine whether 3&#xD;
      months on a diet supplemented with moderate fiber (extra 7g/day), or high fiber (15g/day),&#xD;
      will significantly reduce inflammatory markers compared to a usual diet low in fiber (average&#xD;
      10-15g/day) in a three-month long clinical trial among 180 obese adult volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To accomplish these aims, three related studies will be conducted. The first will utilize&#xD;
      existing data contained in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a national&#xD;
      database of 5773 non-institutionalized adults. The second study will be an additional&#xD;
      procedure and laboratory examination to an existing R01 by one of the investigators, to&#xD;
      examine the impact of a diet naturally high in fiber on CRP and other inflammatory markers.&#xD;
      The third study will consist of new primary data collection in 180 volunteers to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of different levels of fiber supplementation on CRP, fibrinogen, WBC, and&#xD;
      interleukin-6. By using existing data, taking advantage of an ongoing protocol, and adding&#xD;
      new information through primary data collection, the investigators hope to dramatically&#xD;
      increase their understanding of the association between dietary fiber and cardiovascular&#xD;
      inflammatory markers. This information could serve to guide constructive changes in&#xD;
      nutritional guidelines for reducing CVD risk for millions of at-risk individuals.&#xD;
