      To measure the association between estrogen receptor variants and the extent of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis in the thoracic and abdominal aorta and the right coronary artery in subjects&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increased levels of HDL cholesterol are associated with lower rates of clinical and anatomic&#xD;
      atherosclerosis, even in adolescents and young adults. In premenopausal women,&#xD;
      estrogen-associated increases in HDL may account for their low rates of coronary heart&#xD;
      disease (CHD) events. Recently, a sequence variant in the estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-alpha)&#xD;
      gene, ER-alpha IVS1-397 T/C), has been linked to twofold greater increases in HDL cholesterol&#xD;
      in response to hormone replacement therapy (HRT). However, it remains unclear whether this&#xD;
      sequence variant also augments HDL levels in the setting of premenopausal estrogen exposure&#xD;
      and whether such differences translate into greater reductions in atherosclerosis risk. The&#xD;
      study uses the cohort of the Pathobiology of Atherosclerosis in Youth (PDAY) study, a large&#xD;
      cross-sectional autopsy study of the extent of atherosclerosis in subjects aged 15 to 34&#xD;
      years. The detailed descriptions of atherosclerotic lesions, combined with data on&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors and access to tissue for DNA extraction, makes this an ideal&#xD;
      cohort in which to examine the association between ER-alpha IVS1-397 genotypes, HDL levels,&#xD;
      and development of early atherosclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal for this study is to measure the association between the estrogen receptor&#xD;
      (ER- IVS1-401 T/C) polymorphism and extent of abdominal aorta, thoracic artery, and right&#xD;
      coronary artery atherosclerosis in Pathobiological Determinants of Atherosclerosis in Youth&#xD;
      (PDAY) subjects. The investigators will use DNA extracted from liver specimens in order to&#xD;
      measure the ER polymorphisms. The extent of atherosclerosis will be defined as the percent of&#xD;
      intimal area involved with fatty streaks or raised lesions, using previously established PDAY&#xD;
      definitions. However, percent involvement of fatty streaks alone and the percent involvement&#xD;
      of the individual components of raised lesions (fibrous plaques, complicated lesions, and&#xD;
      calcified lesions) will be analyzed separately. Available data on risk factors (smoking,&#xD;
      diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension) will permit reducing confounding of the results by&#xD;
      allowing adjustments for effects of the major risk factors for coronary heart disease. The&#xD;
      Department of Pathology at Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center (LSUHSC) has&#xD;
      been designated by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute to centralize, maintain, and&#xD;
      distribute the valuable material collected through the combined efforts of the cooperating&#xD;
      institutions for further studies in atherosclerosis. LSUHSC will provide DNA for polymorphism&#xD;
      analysis and assist in data analysis. Polymorphism determination will occur at Wake Forest.&#xD;
