  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether he drug ranibizumab can slow or stop the growth of angiomas&#xD;
      (blood vessel tumors) in patients with Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL). Angiomas commonly&#xD;
      develop in the back of the eye on the retina and the optic nerve in patients with VHL.&#xD;
      Although these tumors are not cancerous, they may cause significant vision loss. Current&#xD;
      treatments, including laser therapy, cryotherapy, and vitrectomy, may not be successful or&#xD;
      possible for all patients. Ranibizumab decreases production of VEGF, a growth factor that is&#xD;
      important for the formation of new blood vessels and that is elevated in patients with VHL.&#xD;
      Preliminary findings from other studies suggest that ranibizumab can reduce retinal&#xD;
      thickening caused by vessel and tumor growth and improve vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with retinal angiomas due to VHL in one or both eyes and&#xD;
      central vision loss of 20/40 or worse may be eligible for this study. Participants undergo&#xD;
      the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (EKG) and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye examination, including eye pressure measurement and dilation of the pupils to&#xD;
           examine the retina.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fluorescein angiography to evaluate the eye's blood vessels. For this test, a yellow dye&#xD;
           is injected into an arm vein and travels to the blood vessels in the eyes. Pictures of&#xD;
           the retina are taken using a camera that flashes a blue light into the eye. The pictures&#xD;
           show if any dye has leaked from the vessels into the retina, indicating possible blood&#xD;
           vessel abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optical coherence tomography to measure retinal thickness. The eyes are examined through&#xD;
           a machine that produces cross-sectional pictures of the retina. These measures are&#xD;
           repeated during the study to determine changes, if any, in retinal thickening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stereoscopic color fundus photography to examine the back of the eye. The pupils are&#xD;
           dilated with eye drops to examine and photograph the back of the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electroretinogram (ERG) to measure electrical responses generated from within the&#xD;
           retina. For this test, the patient sits in a dark room for 30 minutes with his or her&#xD;
           eyes patched. Then, a small silver disk electrode is taped to the forehead, the eye&#xD;
           patches are removed, the surface of the eye is numbed with eye drops, and contact lenses&#xD;
           are placed on the eyes. The patient looks inside an open white globe that emits a series&#xD;
           of light flashes for about 20 minutes. The contact lenses sense small electrical signals&#xD;
           generated by the retina when the light flashes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ranibizumab injections to treat ocular angiomas. Ranibizumab is injected through a&#xD;
           needle into the eye's vitreous (gel-like substance that fills the inside of the eye).&#xD;
           Seven injections are given over a 28-week period. Before each injection, the surface of&#xD;
           the eye is numbed with anesthetic eye drops. This is followed by injection of another&#xD;
           anesthetic into the lower portion of the eye in the clear tissue surrounding the white&#xD;
           of the eye. After a few minutes, the ranibizumab is injected into the vitreous. Patients&#xD;
           receive ranibizumab injections at the first visit (during enrollment) and again at 4, 8,&#xD;
           12, 16, 20 and 24 weeks after the first injection. At the 28-week visit, the doctor will&#xD;
           determine if further treatment is needed. Patients can continue to have injections every&#xD;
           4 weeks until 1 year of follow-up (54 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each injection visit, participants repeat most of the tests described above to evaluate&#xD;
      the response to treatment and return a week later for another eye examination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Von Hippel-Lindau Syndrome (VHL) is an autosomal dominant heritable disorder in which&#xD;
      multiple benign and malignant neoplasms and cysts of specific histopathologies develop in the&#xD;
      kidney, adrenal gland, pancreas, brain, spinal cord, eye, inner ear, epididymis, and broad&#xD;
      ligament. Retinal angioma may be one of the earliest manifestations of VHL disease and may&#xD;
      lead to a significant decrease in visual acuity of the affected individual. These tumors&#xD;
      rarely regress spontaneously. The main cause of vision loss is retinal edema, specifically&#xD;
      macular edema secondary to enlargement of peripheral retinal angiomas or angiomas found on or&#xD;
      around the optic disk. Treatment of retinal angiomas depends on the location and size of the&#xD;
      lesions but typically consists of photocoagulation or cryotherapy. However, there is no&#xD;
      proven effective therapy for the treatment of VHL ocular lesions on or surrounding the optic&#xD;
      nerve or lesions in the peripheral retina too large to respond to the traditional therapies.&#xD;
      The genetic mutation found in VHL disease up-regulates the production of vascular endothelial&#xD;
      growth factor (VEGF). Immunochemical studies of the VHL ocular lesions, as well as others&#xD;
      found elsewhere in the body show marked increase in VEGF. This open-label study will pilot&#xD;
      the use of an anti-VEGF therapy, ranibizumab (rhuFab V2) in 5 participants to investigate the&#xD;
      potential efficacy as a treatment for retinal angiomas associated with VHL. Participants will&#xD;
      receive 7 intravitreal injections of study drug over a 6 month period, with the option of up&#xD;
      to seven additional injections at the same dose and schedule during follow-up for a maximum&#xD;
      period of 1 year after the initiation of treatment. The primary outcome will be a change in&#xD;
      the best corrected visual acuity of 15 letters or more eight weeks after a participant&#xD;
      receives the final study injection. The secondary outcomes will be a reduction in retinal&#xD;
      thickening and leakage eight weeks after the participants receives the final study injection,&#xD;
      and adverse events including local and systemic toxicities.&#xD;
