      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent experimental and clinical studies support the concept that vascular inflammation is&#xD;
      central to the development of atherosclerosis, and that systemic inflammatory markers predict&#xD;
      a wide array of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. There is increasing interest in the role&#xD;
      of genetic variation in inflammation contributing to the susceptibility for CVD. To date&#xD;
      mostly small case-control studies have suggested that polymorphisms in inflammatory genes are&#xD;
      associated with subclinical and clinical CVD, but the studies have differed with regard to&#xD;
      which genes are central. The investigators have previously measured systemic markers of&#xD;
      vascular inflammation (e.g. CRP, sICAM-1, MCP-1, IL-6) and oxidative stress (isoprostanes),&#xD;
      in a population-based sample of 3800 middle-aged and elderly men and women of the Framingham&#xD;
      Heart Study offspring cohort. They now propose to genotype inflammatory candidate genes in&#xD;
      the Framingham offspring cohort which have been phenotyped for CVD risk factors, subclinical&#xD;
      CVD.They also propose to measure systemic inflammatory markers in the Framingham Study&#xD;
      Generation III cohort, who are the children of the offspring cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. Benjamin and colleagues will genotype inflammatory candidate genes in the Framingham&#xD;
      offspring cohort which have been phenotyped for CVD risk factors, subclinical CVD. They also&#xD;
      will measure systemic inflammatory markers in the Framingham Study Generation III cohort, who&#xD;
      are the children of the offspring cohort. The central hypothesis of this study is that&#xD;
      systemic vascular inflammation represents a complex phenotype that evolves over a lifetime&#xD;
      and is influenced by both environmental and genetic factors. They further postulate that&#xD;
      variations in the inflammatory phenotype (marker levels) and genotype predispose to the&#xD;
      development of CVD. The purpose of this study is to determine the contribution of genetic and&#xD;
      environmental factors to vascular inflammation, and to define the extent to which&#xD;
      inflammatory phenotypes and genotypes predict subclinical and clinical CVD, and enhance risk&#xD;
      prediction models. The specific aims are: Aim 1. To examine the environmental determinants of&#xD;
      systemic inflammation in the community. Aim 2. To investigate the genetic determinants of&#xD;
      systemic inflammation. Aim 3. To identify the inflammatory phenotypic and genetic&#xD;
      determinants of subclinical CVD. Aim 4. To determine the contribution of inflammatory&#xD;
      phenotype versus genotype to prevalent and incident CVD and to incident hypertension. The&#xD;
      investigation will increase understanding as to whether inflammation is a core risk factor&#xD;
      for CVD or is merely a marker of presence and burden of other CVD risk factors. These&#xD;
      insights will fundamentally contribute to knowledge about the pathophysiology of CVD and may&#xD;
      lead to improved prevention, risk stratification and management of CVD.&#xD;
