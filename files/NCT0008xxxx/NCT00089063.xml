  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial is studying vaccine therapy and sargramostim to see how well&#xD;
      they work compared to vaccine therapy alone in treating patients who have undergone surgery&#xD;
      for stage IIB, stage IIC, stage III, or stage IV melanoma. Vaccines made from peptides may&#xD;
      make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Colony-stimulating factors such&#xD;
      as sargramostim increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood.&#xD;
      Combining vaccine therapy with sargramostim may make a stronger immune response.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate immune reactivity to a tyrosinase:368-376 (370D) /gp100: 209-217 (210M)/MART-1&#xD;
      26-35 (27L) peptide vaccine with Montanide ISA 51 with or without GM-CSF administered as a&#xD;
      booster for five vaccinations over two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, parallel, continuation study. Patients are stratified&#xD;
      according to response to prior vaccination (response to 1 peptide vs response to 2 or more&#xD;
      peptides). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm I: Patients receive vaccination comprising tyrosinase peptide, gp100 antigen, and MART-1&#xD;
      antigen emulsified with Montanide ISA-51 and ISA-51 VG subcutaneously (SC) on day 1 of weeks&#xD;
      0, 26, 52, 78, and 104 (total of 5 vaccinations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm II: Patients receive vaccination comprising tyrosinase peptide, gp100 antigen, and MART-1&#xD;
      antigen emulsified with Montanide ISA-51 and ISA-51 VG as in arm I. Patients also receive&#xD;
      sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC on days 1-5 of weeks 0, 26, 52, 78, and 104.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms, treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed at 2-4 weeks, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients (20 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this&#xD;
      study within 1 year.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status of 0 or 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be eligible for this trial if they have failed alpha-interferon, if it&#xD;
             is felt to be contraindicated due to a pre-existing medical or psychiatric condition&#xD;
             or if they have refused treatment with it&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to read, understand and willingness to sign an IRB-approved informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had another malignancy but with no evidence of disease for greater&#xD;
             than 5 years from accrual to the current trial will be eligible if it is felt they are&#xD;
             likely to be cured; patients with squamous or basal carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma&#xD;
             in situ of the cervix that have been treated with curative intent can be accrued to&#xD;
             this trial 30 days after treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Who have undergone any other systemic therapy for their melanoma, including radiation&#xD;
             therapy since completion of 10M-01-1 or 10M-00-4&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have major systemic infections like pneumonia or sepsis, coagulation or bleeding&#xD;
             disorders, or other major medical illnesses of the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular or&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Who require systemic, ocular or inhaled corticosteroids&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Who are pregnant or lactating, since the risk of autoimmune reactivity to tyrosinase,&#xD;
             MART-1 or gp100 is felt to present a risk to the fetus or a breast feeding infant;&#xD;
             effective birth control for men and women is required during and for four months after&#xD;

             since cells removed for ex vivo handling and tissue culture cannot be virus positive,&#xD;
             and the effects of melanoma peptides might be detrimental to HIV positive patients,&#xD;
