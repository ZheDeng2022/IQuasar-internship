  <brief_summary>

      This study will determine how breathing motions may affect positron emission tomography (PET)&#xD;
      scans. It has been discovered that the quality of PET scans varies according to which part of&#xD;
      the breathing cycle patients hold their breath.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIH Clinical Center patients 12 years of age and older who are scheduled to have PET and&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT) scans as part of their standard medical care may be eligible for&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants have their scheduled PET or CT scan as they normally would and are asked to hold&#xD;
      their breath after breathing out, as is usual. In addition, for this study, patients are also&#xD;
      asked hold their breath after breathing in and again at a point between breathing in and out.&#xD;
      Each breath-hold is for around 15 seconds. The scans for each of the three different&#xD;
      breath-holds are examined for differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some patients may also be asked to breathe through a tube called a pneumotachometer, or&#xD;
      spirometer, to determine their normal breathing pattern. This involves breathing through a&#xD;
      mouthpiece similar to a snorkel mouthpiece and takes about 2 minutes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Current clinical FDG imaging with the NIH's PET/CT machine (and in fact with most commercial&#xD;
      PET/CT machines) requires a CT scan be acquired prior to the PET scan. This CT scan is used&#xD;
      for attenuation correction of the PET data and to permit fusion of anatomical and metabolic&#xD;
      image data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One difficulty with use of the CT scan for attenuation correction ('CTAC') is that the CT&#xD;
      scan is rapid compared to the breathing cycle. Each CT slice captures the lungs at one&#xD;
      (usually arbitrary) phase of the respiratory cycle. The PET data on the other hand take many&#xD;
      minutes to acquire, and so average the motion effects of the entire respiratory cycle&#xD;
      together. This 'freezing' of the respiratory cycle by the CT, and blurring of the respiratory&#xD;
      cycle during PET produces a mis-match between the PET and CT data. This mis-match can produce&#xD;
      improper attenuation correction during PET reconstruction, especially at soft tissue/lung&#xD;
      interfaces. The existence of this phenomenon has been reported in the literature [1-7],&#xD;
      especially at the dome of the liver, but it has not been thoroughly quantified. Little or no&#xD;
      data is available to indicate the quantitative errors the effect produces in cardiac&#xD;
      imaging[8]. This despite the fact that the myocardium is only about 10mm thick, and it has&#xD;
      been reported that the heart moves on average 9mm (and as much as 14mm) during a single&#xD;
      average respiratory cycle[9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this protocol is to determine the degree to which respiratory motion may&#xD;
      influence quantitative PET imaging, especially at the lung/liver interface and free wall of&#xD;
      myocardium. By characterizing the magnitude of the effect, we hope to gain knowledge about&#xD;
      when correction for the effect is and is not necessary. It is hoped that the information&#xD;
      gained will also allow us to suggest potential methods to perform such corrections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To gain the above information we will modify the CT acquisition protocol for subjects already&#xD;
      scheduled to undergo a whole body FDG PET/CT scan. In summary, rather than acquiring the&#xD;
      usual single full radiation exposure CT (taking approx 20-30 seconds), we will acquire 3 CT&#xD;
      scans (each taking approximately 20-30 seconds), each at 1/3 the usual radiation exposure.&#xD;
      Each CT will be acquired at a different phase of the respiratory cycle (as opposed to current&#xD;
      acquisition, which is only at end-expiration). The subsequent PET data will be acquired as&#xD;
      usual, but will be processed and analyzed separately with each of the CT scans and also with&#xD;
      a summed CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note that subjects agreeing to participate in this protocol will receive no additional&#xD;
      radiation exposure. Participation in the protocol will extend the current overall scan time&#xD;
      (typically greater than 45 minutes) a very small amount (about 40-60 additional seconds for&#xD;
      imaging, and about 60 additional seconds for patient set up, etc).&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Up to 30 subjects will take part in the study, chosen from sequential incoming clinical&#xD;
        patients who are scheduled for PET/CT studies of the torso and who have had or will have a&#xD;
        diagnostic CT within one week of the PET/CT study, without regard to disease. The number of&#xD;
        subjects selected for study per week will depend on patient load and availability of&#xD;
        scanner and technologist). Approximately an equal number of males and females will be&#xD;
        selected by alternating each selection between male and female. The selection of subjects&#xD;
        asked to participate will be random, in the sense that whenever technologist and analysis&#xD;
        time is available, the next subject scheduled for a whole body scan will be asked to&#xD;
        participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        The only exclusion criteria will be subjects with respiratory difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children under the age of 12.&#xD;
