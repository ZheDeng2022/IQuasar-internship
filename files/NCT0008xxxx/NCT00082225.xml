    <textblock>
      Patients have a type of cancer called Hodgkin's lymphoma or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which has&#xD;
      come back or not gone away or is at high risk for coming back after treatment, including the&#xD;
      best treatment investigators know for this disease. Investigators are asking the patient to&#xD;
      volunteer to be in a research study using a new experimental therapy consisting of special&#xD;
      immune system cells called LMP2 specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in combination with a&#xD;
      special protein called a monoclonal antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some patients with Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin Lymphoma show evidence of infection with the virus&#xD;
      that causes infectious mononucleosis Epstein Barr virus (EBV) before or at the time of their&#xD;
      diagnosis of the lymphoma. EBV is found in the cancer cells of up to half the patients with&#xD;
      lymphoma, suggesting that it may play a role in causing lymphoma. The cancer cells infected&#xD;
      by EBV are able to hide from the body's immune system and escape destruction. Investigators&#xD;
      want to see if special white blood cells, called T cells, that have been trained to kill EBV&#xD;
      infected cells can survive in the blood and affect the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have used this sort of therapy to treat a different type of cancer that&#xD;
      occurs after bone marrow and solid organ transplant called post transplant lymphoma. In this&#xD;
      type of cancer the tumor cells have 9 proteins made by EBV on their surface. They grew T&#xD;
      cells in the laboratory that recognized all 9 proteins and were able to prevent and treat&#xD;
      post transplant lymphoma. However in Hodgkin disease and non-Hodgkin Lymphoma the tumor cells&#xD;
      only express 2 EBV proteins. In a previous study investigators made T cells that recognized&#xD;
      all 9 proteins and gave them to patients with Hodgkin disease. Some patients had a partial&#xD;
      response to this therapy but no patients had a complete response. Investigators think one&#xD;
      reason may be that many of the T cells reacted with proteins that were not on the tumor&#xD;
      cells. They are now trying to find out if they can improve this treatment by growing T cells&#xD;
      that only recognize one of the proteins expressed on Lymphoma cells called LMP-2. These&#xD;
      special T cells are called LMP-2 specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study investigators also are trying to see if they can improve these results by&#xD;
      treating patients first with a special protein called an antibody and then giving the EBV&#xD;
      specific T cells. The reason for doing this is that EBV specific T cells have worked very&#xD;
      well in bone marrow transplant patients to prevent and treat EBV cancers. These patients have&#xD;
      very few of their own immune cells when they are given the trained T cells and therefore&#xD;
      there is a lot of space for the trained cells to grow. Investigators hope that they can&#xD;
      improve the effect of the trained T cells in Hodgkin disease and non-Hodgkin Lymphoma&#xD;
      patients by first temporarily removing the patient's own T cells before giving the trained&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;

      Investigators first tested a biopsy of the tumor that has already been done to see if the&#xD;
      tumor cells are EBV positive. They then got permission to take up to 60ml (12 teaspoonfuls)&#xD;
      of blood from the patient or their donor on one or two occasions and used this blood to grow&#xD;
      T cells in the laboratory. They first grew a special type of cell called dendritic cells&#xD;
      stimulate the T cells and put a specially produced human virus (adenovirus) that carries the&#xD;
      LMP-2a gene into the dendritic cells. These dendritic cells were then treated with radiation&#xD;
      so they could not grow. They were then used to stimulate T cells. This stimulation trained&#xD;
      the T cells to kill cells with LMP-2a on their surface. Investigators then grew these LMP-2a&#xD;
      specific CTLs by more stimulation with EBV infected cells (which were made from the patient's&#xD;
      blood or their donor's blood by infecting them with EBV in the laboratory). The investigators&#xD;
      also put the adenovirus that carries the LMP2 gene into these EBV infected cells to increase&#xD;
      the amount of LMP2 that these cells have. Again, these EBV infected cells were treated with&#xD;
      radiation so they could not grow. Once sufficient numbers of T cells were made, investigators&#xD;
      tested them to make sure they kill cells with LMP2a on their surface. These cells are now&#xD;
      ready to give to the patient if they agree to being on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators also took up to 500 ml (2 1/2 cups) of extra blood from the patient or their&#xD;
      donor, which were frozen. In case the patient's own cells do not recover as expected after&#xD;
      the antibody and cell infusions, these cells can be thawed and given back to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient agrees to this treatment they will get treated with the CD45 antibodies for 4&#xD;
      days in a row and then 2-3 days later get a dose of LMP2 specific CTLs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CD45 antibodies will be given to the patient through a vein for 6-8 hours and monitored&#xD;
      for at least 6 hours after the infusion. After the infusion The patient will be checked for&#xD;
      the levels of CD45 in the blood at 24 hours (optional) and/or at 48-72 hours after the last&#xD;
      infusion to check the level is low enough to give the patient the CTLs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CTLs will be thawed and injected through a central line, if the patient has one, or&#xD;
      through a vein in their arm over 10 minutes, after pretreatment with Tylenol and Benadryl. We&#xD;
      will then monitor them in clinic for 4 hours after the injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the treatments will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas&#xD;
      Children's Hospital or the Methodist Hospital. We will follow the patient in the clinic after&#xD;
      the CTL injection. If there is a reduction in the size of the lymphoma on CT or MRI scans as&#xD;
      assessed by a radiologist, they can receive up to six additional doses of the T cells if they&#xD;
      wish.&#xD;
