      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver&#xD;
      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Vaccines may make the body&#xD;
      build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Combining the vaccines with Montanide ISA-51&#xD;
      may cause a stronger immune response and kill more tumor cells. Giving monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      therapy together with vaccine therapy may be an effective treatment for stage III or stage IV&#xD;
      melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving monoclonal antibody therapy together&#xD;
      with vaccine therapy works in treating patients with resected stage III or stage IV melanoma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Achieve at least a 40% autoimmune breakthrough event rate, as defined by the induction&#xD;
           of grade 1, grade 2, or acceptable grade 3 drug-related autoimmune adverse events, in&#xD;
           patients with resected stage III or IV melanoma treated with anti-cytotoxic&#xD;
           T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 monoclonal antibody (MDX-010) and peptide vaccine&#xD;
           comprising tyrosinase, gp100 antigen, and MART-1 antigen emulsified in Montanide ISA-51.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the incidence of drug-related autoimmune adverse events of any grade in&#xD;
           patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the time to disease relapse in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the immunologic response in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      (MDX-010) IV over 90 minutes on day 1 of weeks 1, 9, 17, 25, 33, 41, and 53 and peptide&#xD;
      vaccine comprising tyrosinase, gp100 antigen, and MART-1 antigen emulsified in Montanide&#xD;
      ISA-51 subcutaneously on day 1 of weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 17, 21, 25, 33, 41, and 53.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then&#xD;
      annually thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
