    <textblock>
      This study is not a treatment protocol and no experimental treatments are involved. Study&#xD;
      participants may be seen as needed for clinical, translational and basic research studies, or&#xD;
      as medically indicated. Subjects will receive their general medical care outside the NIH and&#xD;
      will be seen at our clinic or at CNHS with varying frequency. Subjects may be seen for&#xD;
      multiple visits. Subjects may be asked to return for additional testing as needed. Clinical&#xD;
      care for patients with sickle cell disease will be provided as appropriate through the Sickle&#xD;
      Cell Clinic and the inpatient clinical center.&#xD;

      This protocol will permit the establishment of a repository of biospecimens from individuals&#xD;
      affected with sickle cell disease to identify and evaluate underlying disease mechanism(s),&#xD;
      and to facilitate understanding of the pathogenesis and natural history of vaso-occlusive&#xD;
      painful crisis and other complications of the disease. Patients will be evaluated with a&#xD;
      medical history and physical examination and routine laboratory studies will be obtained as&#xD;
      needed to assess diagnosis, disease activity, and disease complications and to monitor for&#xD;
      treatment-related responses and toxicities. This protocol may also provide for the continued&#xD;
      storage and analysis of clinical and research data, and biospecimens previously obtained from&#xD;
      other NIH Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved protocols with subject consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients eligible for other research protocols will be offered an opportunity to participate&#xD;
      in these studies after signed informed consent has been obtained. Apart from such protocols,&#xD;
      any medical care or additional tests/investigations recommended or provided to the patient&#xD;
      will be consistent with routine standards of practice and will be provided in consultation&#xD;
      with the patient s referring physician.&#xD;
