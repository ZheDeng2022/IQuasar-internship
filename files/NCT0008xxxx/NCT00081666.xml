      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most important tasks that cardiovascular clinicians perform is risk&#xD;
      stratification, as that enables appropriate targeting of aggressive treatments to patients&#xD;
      that are most likely to benefit from them. Contemporary risk stratification strategies&#xD;
      include clinical scoring systems along with performance of noninvasive tests. Although these&#xD;
      approaches are commonly used, clinicians still find themselves needing to incorporate&#xD;
      multiple pieces of clinical information into a cohesive global risk assessment. The concept&#xD;
      of utilizing data from large observational data sets to develop complex risk scores and to&#xD;
      encourage their use in routine practice is therefore gradually evolving and gaining&#xD;
      acceptance. The Logical Analysis of Data (LAD) is a potentially useful approach for&#xD;
      systematically analyzing large databases for the purpose of developing and validating&#xD;
      clinically useful risk prediction schemes. Unlike standard regression techniques, LAD does&#xD;
      not primarily focus on individual risk factors and two-way interactions between them. Rather,&#xD;
      LAD is designed to identify complex patterns of findings, or syndromes, that predict&#xD;
      outcomes. This method has been applied to problems in economics, seismology and oil&#xD;
      exploration, but not to medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has three specific aims: 1). to apply LAD to develop and validate risk prediction&#xD;
      instruments among patients undergoing different types of cardiac surgery. 2. to compare the&#xD;
      predictive value of LAD predictive instruments with predictive instruments developed using&#xD;
      standard statistical methods, including multiple time-phase parametric modeling. 3. to&#xD;
      develop predictive instruments using relative risk forests, a new Monte Carlo method for&#xD;
      estimating risk values in large survival data settings with large numbers of correlated&#xD;
      variables. Relative risk forests are an adaptation of random forests introduced by Breiman.&#xD;
      When possible these methods will be compared to LAD. Internal estimates for the&#xD;
      generalization error, a measure of how well the method will generalize to other data&#xD;
      settings, will be computed and will be used in the development of the predictive instrument.&#xD;
      Relative risk forests will also be compared to several other non-deterministic methods,&#xD;
      including boosting and spike and slab variable selection. All of these techniques can be used&#xD;
      to develop complex models while maintaining good prediction error and are ideal for high&#xD;
      dimensional problems where traditional methods breakdown. Although this project will focus on&#xD;
      risk assessment among patients undergoing cardiac surgery, it is important to recognize that&#xD;
      we are primarily interested in the value of LAD as a means of analyzing very large and&#xD;
      complex data sets within a medical sphere. Hence, the applicability of this work goes beyond&#xD;
      determination of risk of patients undergoing cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data used for this study will consist of cardiac surgery data from the Cleveland Clinic&#xD;
      Foundation Cardiovascular Information Registry (CVIR). Four cohorts of data will be&#xD;
      assembled; Cohort I: 18,914 CABG patients between 1990 and 2000; Cohort II: 6952 patients&#xD;
      undergoing aortic valve replacement; Cohort III: 2979 patients undergoing mitral valve&#xD;
      replacement; Cohort IV: 10,482 patients undergoing mitral valve repair. The primary endpoint&#xD;
      will be long term total mortality; for valve surgery patients it will be active follow-up.&#xD;
