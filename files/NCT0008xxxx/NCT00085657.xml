      This study will examine whether brain stimulation using transcranial direct current&#xD;
      stimulation (tDCS) in stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation therapy can help patients&#xD;
      recover strength and motor function more than rehabilitation therapy alone. For tDCS, two&#xD;
      small metal disks (electrodes) attached to wires are placed on small cotton pads and taped to&#xD;
      the subject's head, one on the forehead above the eye and the other on the top of the head.&#xD;
      The electrodes deliver a brief electrical current that stimulates the cortex, the part of the&#xD;
      brain responsible for motor function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients who have weakness on one side of their body as a result of a stroke occurred&#xD;
      within the last 15 days may be eligible for this study. NIH is not directly recruiting&#xD;
      patients for this study. Patients will be selected through the National Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Hospital (NRH) Research Center personnel in Washington, DC, from patients under treatment at&#xD;
      that facilitiy. Candidates are screened with a physical and neurologic examination, a review&#xD;
      of tests done on admission to NRH, and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, if one has&#xD;
      not been done since the stroke. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain&#xD;
      images of the brain. The MRI scanner is a metal cylinder surrounded by a strong magnetic&#xD;
      field. During the MRI, the patient lies on a table that can slide in and out of the cylinder.&#xD;
      Scanning time for this study takes about 30 to 45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomly assigned to receive tDCS or placebo stimulation, along with&#xD;
      rehabilitation therapy, for 2 to 3 weeks, depending on the patient's length of stay at the&#xD;
      NRH. For the placebo stimulation, electrodes are placed on the patient's scalp as with tDCS,&#xD;
      but no current is delivered. Before and after each rehabilitation session with electrodes,&#xD;
      patients undergo Jebsen Taylor motor testing, in which they are asked to lift small objects,&#xD;
      turn cards, use a spoon, stack checkers, and lift cans as fast as they can.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of discharge, patients have physical and neurological examinations and the motor&#xD;
      function tests described below. The motor tests are repeated, along with standard care and a&#xD;
      review of their health status, during outpatient follow-up visits scheduled at 3, and 12&#xD;
      months. The motor tests are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wolf motor function test - Patients are asked to raise a forearm on a table, on a box,&#xD;
           to reach across a table, push a sandbag, place a hand on the table, pull a weight, lift&#xD;
           a can, pick up a pencil, pick up a paper clip, stack checkers, flip cards, use a key,&#xD;
           fold a towel, and pick up a basket.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Barthel index - Patients are timed for the speed with which they perform certain tasks,&#xD;
           such as feeding, grooming, or moving a wheelchair.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abilhand questionnaire - Patients answer questions about how they perform routine daily&#xD;
           activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GOT test of tactile discrimination - Patients describe objects they feel with their&#xD;
           hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ashworth spasticity scale - A medical staff person moves the patient's arm back and&#xD;
           forth to see how stiff it is.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no universally accepted strategy to promote recovery of motor function after stroke,&#xD;
      the main cause of long-term disability among adults. Neurorehabilitation contributes to&#xD;
      recovery during the first days to weeks after stroke and later decelerates. Therefore, it is&#xD;
      desirable to develop strategies to enhance rehabilitative effects on motor recovery&#xD;
      particularly in the early phase after stroke in this patient group. We have recently&#xD;
      demonstrated that cortical stimulation in the form of TMS enhances the beneficial effects of&#xD;
      motor training and cortical plasticity in healthy volunteers and that tDCS (another&#xD;
      noninvasive more comfortable stimulating technique than TMS transiently improves functional&#xD;
      motor skills of the paretic hand of chronic stroke patients in the absence of training. Given&#xD;
      the paucity of strategies available to enhance neurorehabilitation after stroke, it is now&#xD;
      crucial to determine if tDCS can enhance the beneficial effects of customarily used&#xD;
      rehabilitative treatment. tDCS has been used in several hundred subjects worldwide and in&#xD;
      approximately 9 stroke patients, 15 Parkinson's disease patients and 15 healthy volunteers in&#xD;
      our lab in the absence of undesirable side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the above objectives, we will also apply functional magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (fMRI) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) techniques to determine the extent of&#xD;
      changes in neural responses and functional shift in cortical representations/reorganization&#xD;
      as a result of the proposed intervention strategies. fMRI as a measure is important in&#xD;
      understanding changes in brain activation prior to, during, and after motor recovery and the&#xD;
      effects of tDCS and the rehabilitative treatment strategies under investigation. Integrating&#xD;
      TMS together with fMRI studies will provide crucial information on the functional role of&#xD;
      brain regions activated in neuroimaging studies in association with functional recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to study 120 patients with a single cortical or subcortical subacute stroke. Thirty&#xD;
      healthy volunteers and a sub-group of 30 patients from the 120 patient population will also&#xD;
      be recruited in the fMRI and TMS part of the study. The reason for including 30 patients in&#xD;
      the fMRI and TMS components of the study is that it is anticipated that not all the 120&#xD;
      patients recruited in the initial study (i.e., the tDCS and therapeutic intervention phase)&#xD;
      may be able to perform the tasks required for the fMRI part of the study and also satisfy the&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria for fMRI scans. In addition, based on previous studies and preliminary&#xD;
      fMRI power analysis, we estimate that 30 patients is likely to be sufficient to provide a&#xD;
      representative sample of the patient group for the testing of the hypotheses stated in the&#xD;
      protocol. Thirty healthy volunteers are necessary for the fMRI and TMS components of the&#xD;
      study in order to obtain normative data for the TMS and fMRI components of the investigation.&#xD;
      They will have the multiple number of TMS and fMRI sessions as patients in order to obtain&#xD;
      descriptive information on the variability of these measures in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this protocol is to test the hypothesis that tDCS applied in combination with&#xD;
      customary rehabilitative training as used in the community (RT) will enhance motor recovery 3&#xD;
      months after admission relative to placebo and RT, and that functional recovery is associated&#xD;
      with changes in cortical excitability in the ipsilesional primary motor cortex (M1) and&#xD;
      dorsal pre-motor cortex. The tDCS part of the study will be done at the NRH (where is being&#xD;
      evaluated in parallel with the NINDS review process). Patients will be included in the&#xD;
      protocol as soon as they are admitted to the NRH for RT (usually 3-10 days after the ictal&#xD;
      event). Patients, who are eligible for the protocol will be randomized in one of the two&#xD;
      study arms: RT + tDCS or RT + placebo stimulation. In both study arms patients will take part&#xD;
      in daily customary RT procedures. We will record the specific rehabilitative therapy received&#xD;
      by the patient. In the tDCS study arm, patients will receive tDCS of the motor cortex&#xD;
      associated with RT every other day for the time of the inpatient stay (14 days). Placebo will&#xD;
      be implemented in the same way and with the same stimulating equipment in place as tDCS.&#xD;
      Patient and therapist (who will provide treatment and determine the primary outcome measure)&#xD;
      will not be aware of arm participation (double-blind study design).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal volunteers will be recruited only for the fMRI and TMS part of the study which will be&#xD;
      carried out at the NIH. They will be screened based on the criteria listed in the protocol&#xD;
      and receive a neurological exam to determine their qualification for the proposed studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measure will be the Jebsen-Tailor-Test (JTT), a test measuring the functional&#xD;
      abilities of the hand in daily living activities. Secondary outcome measures will include the&#xD;
      Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), the Fugl-Meyer-scale (FMS), the MRC scale, the Abilhand&#xD;
      scale (AHS), Barthel Index, Ashworth-Spasticity scale (ASS), and grating orientation task&#xD;
      (GOT) and the NIH stroke scale. For the fMRI and TMS studies, changes in BOLD (blood&#xD;
      oxygenation level dependent) response and delayed reaction time will be the outcome measures.&#xD;
