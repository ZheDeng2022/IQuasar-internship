  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of an investigational vaccine called TroVax&#xD;
      when given in conjunction with Interleukin-2 (IL-2) treatment. TroVax is the experimental&#xD;
      product in this trial and its value as a medicine has not yet been proven. Interleukin-2&#xD;
      (IL-2) is standard treatment for your cancer, which means that you could receive it even if&#xD;
      you choose not to participate in this study. TroVax is being studied as a possible treatment&#xD;
      for patients with cancer of the kidney.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TroVax belongs to a class of medicines called a vaccine. A vaccine helps the body's immune&#xD;
      system to recognize and kill foreign invading organisms effectively. It is believed that one&#xD;
      of the reasons why cancer can spread through the body is that the immune system cannot&#xD;
      recognize them as being different from normal tissues and therefore cannot kill the cancer&#xD;
      cells. A vaccine that alerts the immune system to the presence of cancer cells in the body&#xD;
      could lead to the immune system being able to target and kill those cancer cells effectively.&#xD;
      This trial is of a completely new way of trying to treat cancer in the future by the use of&#xD;
      vaccination injections. TroVax consists of a virus that has been changed so that it is no&#xD;
      longer infectious and carries a gene for a protein called 5T4. This protein is carried by&#xD;
      many kidney cancer calls. When the virus is injected, it makes the protein, and the body's&#xD;
      immune system is then able to recognize this protein and kill the cells that have it (i.e.&#xD;
      the cancer cells).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of TroVax injections and&#xD;
      to understand whether TroVax could make such an immune response happen in patients with renal&#xD;
      cell cancer while receiving Interleukin-2 (IL-2). This study will also observe and monitor&#xD;
      any side effects experienced in patients who receive TroVax while being treated with IL-2.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of TroVax injections when given as a therapeutic&#xD;
           vaccine to patients with metastatic renal cell cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the immune responses induced by treatment with TroVax&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the impact of treatment with TroVax on tumour response rates, time to disease&#xD;
           progression and two year survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This will be an open label evaluation of the combination of TroVax with IL-2.&#xD;
      The dosage regimen will be injections of TroVax given at three weekly intervals commencing&#xD;
      before treatment with IL-2 (one treatment) and then in conjunction with IL-2 for up to four&#xD;
      treatments. Following completion of treatment with IL-2, booster injections of TroVax will be&#xD;
      given at three monthly intervals for a further three injections to patients whose disease&#xD;
      responds or stabilises after treatment with IL-2 and TroVax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first dose of TroVax will be given alone to allow an initial safety assessment. The&#xD;
      second dose will be given with the standard institutional regimen of high dose IL-2. IL-2&#xD;
      will be given for 5 consecutive days every three weeks for two or more (typically four)&#xD;
      cycles provided that the patients are responding to treatment (i.e. tumour response or&#xD;
      stabilisation). The first dose of IL-2 will be given starting on the same day as the second&#xD;
      TroVax injection. If the patient does not tolerate treatment with IL-2, dosing with TroVax&#xD;
      will continue on a three weekly cycle until a total of 5 injections has been given (week 12).&#xD;
      Following this, TroVax boosters will be given every at six, nine and 12 months providing that&#xD;
      the disease remains stable or responding. The total treatment period may last for up to 12&#xD;
      months with a further follow up period of up to 12 months (total study period 24 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed up to assess tolerability, induction of humoural and cellular&#xD;
      immunity to 5T4 cell surface antigen and immune response to the vector. The tumour will be&#xD;
      restaged after every two cycles of IL-2 treatment by CT scans, in accordance with current&#xD;
      institutional and clinical guidelines. Once treatment with IL-2 has stopped, boosting and&#xD;
      restaging will occur every 3 months for a total treatment period of up to one year. Once this&#xD;
      treatment has stopped, patients will be followed for a further twelve months, with CT scans&#xD;
      every 3 months (standard of care). If at the end of that period, the patient still has stable&#xD;
      or responding disease, that patient will be followed at three monthly intervals until disease&#xD;
      progression occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patients' disease progresses at any stage or serious or severe adverse drug reactions&#xD;
      relating to TroVax occur, treatment with TroVax will cease but patients should be kept on&#xD;
      study and followed three monthly until they have been on study for 24 months. Other&#xD;
      treatments for the cancer will be recorded in the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 25 patients will be enrolled.&#xD;

&#xD;
        4. Concurrent involvement in a clinical trial of any other drug. Treatment plan and methods&#xD;
           This will be an open label evaluation of the combination of TroVax with IL-2. The dosage&#xD;
           regimen will be three injections of TroVax given every three weeks. The first vaccine&#xD;
           will be given alone. The second and third vaccine will be given at weeks 3 and 6 with&#xD;
           IL-2 commencing immediately after vaccination. If there is no evidence of disease&#xD;
           progression on the week 9 CT scans (chest, abdomen, pelvis), an additional two cycles of&#xD;
           TroVax and IL-2 will be given at weeks 9 and 12. Following completion of treatment with&#xD;
           IL-2, booster injections of TroVax will be given at three monthly intervals for a&#xD;
           further three injections, provided patients have stable or responding disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complying with the entry criteria will be invited to enter the study. After giving&#xD;
      fully informed consent, patients will be subjected to a medical history and physical&#xD;
      examination to document general fitness to proceed with the trial. Previous exposure to small&#xD;
      pox vaccine will be noted. The diagnosis should be confirmed histologically from the&#xD;
      patient's records. If possible, a retained sample will be obtained to stain for 5T4. If a&#xD;
      fresh sample is taken, it may be cryopreserved and also examined for 5T4. At that time,&#xD;
      metastases will be documented using relevant CT scans (chest, abdomen, pelvic). An MRI scan&#xD;
      of the brain will be obtained. A cardiac stress test and pulmonary function tests will be&#xD;
      obtained in appropriate patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will also be drawn for haematology and clinical chemistry, full blood count with&#xD;
      differential white cell and platelet counts, urea and electrolytes, liver function tests&#xD;
      (total bilirubin, AST, ALT, GGT, alkaline phosphatase), serum proteins, calcium, phosphate,&#xD;
      glucose and creatinine), pituitary hormone screen (ACTH, TSH, LH, FSH;), antinuclear and&#xD;
      anti-skeletal muscle antibodies and immunological testing (antibodies to 5T4 and vector,&#xD;
      cellular responses to 5T4; 100 ml). In potentially fertile women, a pregnancy test will be&#xD;
      obtained. A urine sample will be obtained for urinalysis for protein and blood. This screen&#xD;
      should not occur more than two weeks before the immunisation schedule begins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At week 0, the patients will be immunised with a single intramuscular injection of 1 ml of&#xD;
      TroVax 10x. This dose will be given without IL-2. Then, every three to four weeks for four&#xD;
      injections, TroVax will be given in the morning. These doses may be given in conjunction with&#xD;
      IL-2. Immediately before each injection, blood will be drawn for immunological testing (100&#xD;
      ml). Before the injection, blood will also be drawn for clinical pathology (full blood count&#xD;
      and clinical chemistry). A urine sample will be obtained for urinalysis for protein and&#xD;
      blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IL-2 will be given intravenously (IV) in a dose of 600,000 IU/kg every eight hours for up to&#xD;
      15 injections in each cycle. The first dose will be given in the afternoon of the same day as&#xD;
      the second TroVax injection. These cycles of TroVax and IL-2 will be repeated every 3-4 weeks&#xD;
      depending upon patient tolerance and clinical response. Cycles of IL-2 will always commence&#xD;
      in the afternoon after TroVax has been given in the morning. If IL-2 is not tolerated, it may&#xD;
      be suspended but treatment with TroVax will be continued so long as it is well tolerated.&#xD;
      TroVax may be given for up to three months (i.e. injection 5) to patients with progressive&#xD;
      disease so long as no other anticancer treatment (i.e. chemotherapy, interferon alpha or&#xD;
      radiotherapy) is considered indicated for them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT scans (chest abdomen, pelvis) will be obtained to restage the disease at weeks 9-10 and&#xD;
      15-16 (i.e. after two and four doses of IL-2 and/or 3 and 5 doses of TroVax).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blood sample for immunological testing (100 ml) will be obtained three and eight weeks&#xD;
      after the fifth TroVax injection (4 and 5 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the CT scan at 15-16 weeks patients will be followed at three monthly intervals,&#xD;
      commencing at six months. Patients whose disease is progressing at this point may not be&#xD;
      treated further with TroVax but may be kept on study and observed at three monthly intervals.&#xD;
      Patients whose disease has stabilised or responded will be offered three further injections&#xD;
      of TroVax at months 6, 9 and 12. Patients whose disease progresses or who experience serious&#xD;
      or severe adverse events related to TroVax will stop treatment with TroVax but may be kept on&#xD;
      study and reviewed at three monthly intervals. If the patient requires further treatment with&#xD;
      established anticancer agents, these will be recorded in the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit, from week 12 to month 12, regardless of disease status, blood will be obtained&#xD;
      (prior to the injection of TroVax, if indicated) for clinical pathology, pituitary hormone&#xD;
      screen, autoantibodies and immunological testing (100 ml). A urine sample will be obtained&#xD;
      for urinalysis for protein and blood. The disease will be restaged using CT scans (chest&#xD;
      abdomen, pelvis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      When TroVax is being administered, patients will return 3 weeks after each TroVax injection&#xD;
      for immunological testing (100 ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After month 12, patients will return at three monthly intervals for a further 12 months. At&#xD;
      each visit, the disease will be restaged using CT scans (chest abdomen, pelvis) in accordance&#xD;
      with current institutional guidelines. Blood (100 ml) will be obtained for immunological&#xD;
      testing, autoantibodies and pituitary function tests. A urine sample will be obtained for&#xD;
      urinalysis for protein and blood. Patients, who at the end of this period, have stable or&#xD;
      responding disease may be followed at three monthly intervals until disease progression&#xD;
      occurs.&#xD;
