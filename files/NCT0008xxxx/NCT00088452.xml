      The purpose of this study is to determine the best initial treatment for childhood absence&#xD;
      epilepsy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) is a common pediatric epilepsy syndrome that affects 10 to&#xD;
      15 percent of all children with epilepsy. Individuals with CAE have brief staring spell&#xD;
      seizures that occur suddenly, unpredictably, and frequently throughout the day. These&#xD;
      seizures impair the children's ability to learn and play, and lead to higher injury rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many medications used to treat seizures, but only 3 generally are used as the first&#xD;
      treatment for children with CAE: ethosuximide, lamotrigine, and valproic acid. The goal of&#xD;
      this study is to determine which of these 3 medicines is the best first choice as treatment&#xD;
      for children with CAE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 439 children, recruited over a 3-year period at 32 medical centers in the US,&#xD;
      will take part in this 5-year study. Participants will be randomly given one of the 3 common&#xD;
      CAE treatments-ethosuximide, lamotrigine, or valproic acid-and will make regular visits to a&#xD;
      clinic every 1 to 3 months for approximately 2 years. During the visits, participants will&#xD;
      undergo regular testing to determine if the medicine is working, to watch for side effects,&#xD;
      and to help researchers learn more about the responses to these medicines. In addition,&#xD;
      researchers hope to develop methods that may be used in the future to help choose the best&#xD;
      medicine for each individual diagnosed with CAE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also included in the study will be pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics research.&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics is the study of how the body absorbs, distributes, metabolizes, and excretes&#xD;
      drugs. Pharmacogenetics is the study of genetic determinants of the response to drugs.&#xD;
      Knowledge gained from this study may lead to individualized treatment for children with CAE,&#xD;
      and may also be beneficial for other pediatric and adult seizure disorders.&#xD;

    <description>Treatment failure was defined as persistence of absence seizures at week 16 or week 20, a generalized tonic-clonic seizure at any time, excessive drug-related systemic toxicity, a moderately severe rash (possibly drug-related), pancreatitis, or increase in the body-mass index of at least 3.0 from baseline, dose-limiting toxicity after a single downward dose modification, or withdrawal initiated by the parent or physician.</description>

    <time_frame>First 16-20 weeks of double blind therapy</time_frame>
    <description>A Confidence Index of 0.60 or higher on the Conners' Continuous Performance Test at the visit at 16 or 20 weeks or at an earlier visit when treatment was discontinued (as long as the discontinuation occurred 1 month or more after the baseline visit and was not due to intolerable adverse events). A Confidence Index of 0.60 corresponds to a 60% probability that the child has clinical attention deficit disorder.</description>

          <description>Ethosuximide&#xD;
Frequency and Duration: twice a day, every day for the duration of the study treatment&#xD;
Formulation: Two formulations were used (actual formulation used was dependent on the patient's weight and ability to swallow): 250mg Zarontin capsules OR 250 mg/5 mL Zarontin syrup&#xD;
Dosing: Ethosuximide was titrated in predetermined increments every 1-2 weeks during a 16-week titration period. The titration continued until the patient a) achieved seizure freedom by clinical and EEG criteria, b) reached the maximal allowed study drug dose, c) reached the maximal tolerated dose, or d) developed dose-exiting criteria (treatment failure), whichever came first. Maximum allowed dose: 60 mg/kg/day or 2000 mg/day (whichever was lower)&#xD;

Formulation: Two formulations were used (actual formulation used was dependent on the patient's weight and ability to swallow): 250mg Zarontin capsules OR 250 mg/5 mL Zarontin syrup&#xD;
