    <textblock>
      A Phase I, open-label, non-randomized, sequential dose escalation cohort trial of the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of AP23573 when administered intravenously as&#xD;
      a 30-minute infusion, once daily for five days, repeated every two weeks, to patients with&#xD;
      progressive or recurrent malignant glioma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) of AP23573 when administered intravenously once daily for five days&#xD;
      repeated every two weeks to patients with progressive or recurrent gliomas who have failed&#xD;
      standard therapy and who are or are not receiving enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant (EIAC)&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to: characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of AP23573 when&#xD;
      administered daily for five days repeated every two weeks at the indicated dosage levels in&#xD;
      patients receiving and not receiving EIAC; describe the progression-free survival at six&#xD;
      months; describe changes in proteins affected by mTOR inhibition; describe single timepoint&#xD;
      status of proteins affected by mTOR inhibition in tumor tissue surgical specimens after&#xD;
      AP23573 dosing; describe the status of key proteins in the mTOR signaling pathway in archival&#xD;
      tumor samples, if available; describe health-related quality of life at the start of the&#xD;
      trial and prior to study drug infusion and at various timepoints throughout the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol Outline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase I, open-label, non-randomized, sequential dose escalation cohort trial of the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and MTD of AP23573 when administered intravenously as a 30-minute&#xD;
      infusion, once daily for five days, repeated every two weeks, to patients with progressive or&#xD;
      recurrent malignant glioma.&#xD;

          -  Patients must have had a tissue proven malignant glioma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A minimum interval of at least four weeks prior to the first dose of AP23573 must have&#xD;
             elapsed for all patients enrolling after either prior surgery or completion of prior&#xD;
             external beam radiotherapy for initial primary diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A minimum interval of four weeks prior to the first dose of AP23573 must have elapsed&#xD;
