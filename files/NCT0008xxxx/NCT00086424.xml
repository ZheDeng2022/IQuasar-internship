      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is the main mediator of effects of growth hormone (GH)&#xD;
      and an important regulator of cell cycle/differentiation and inhibitor of apoptosis.&#xD;
      Consistent with laboratory studies showing potentially beneficial effects of IGF-I on the&#xD;
      cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems, GH-deficient individuals have high cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease (CVD) mortality and evidence of premature atherosclerotic disease that is reversible&#xD;
      with GH replacement. In addition, several epidemiological and clinical studies have shown an&#xD;
      association between low serum IGF-I levels and myocardial infarction (MI) and congestive&#xD;
      heart failure (CHF) among persons without frank abnormalities of the GH/IGF-I axis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is the first prospective investigation to assess whether serum levels of IGF-I and&#xD;
      two of its important binding proteins, IGFBP-3, and IGFBP-1, are associated with incidence of&#xD;
      confirmed incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in older male and female adults.&#xD;
      Specimens and data for this study will be obtained from the Cardiovascular Health Study&#xD;
      (CHS), a large, multi-center NHLBI-funded prospective cohort study of 5,888&#xD;
      community-dwelling men and women 65 years or older. The study uses an efficient case-cohort&#xD;
      study design to select specimens for testing, involving evaluation of 750 incident myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (MI)/fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) cases, 500 incident stroke cases, 750&#xD;
      incident congestive heart failure (CHF) cases, and a comparison sub-cohort of 750 individuals&#xD;
      selected at random from the study population. The study examines the association between&#xD;
      baseline serum IGF-I, IGFBP-1, and IGFBP-3 level and the future occurrence of first incident&#xD;
      MI/fatal CHD, ischemic stroke, and CHF. Multivariate regression models are used to control&#xD;
      for potential confounding factors including age, sex, race/ethnicity, anthropometry and body&#xD;
      composition, fasting and 2-hour post-load glucose and insulin levels, dietary intake,&#xD;
      physical activity, hormone replacement therapy and other medications, and other CVD risk&#xD;
      markers such as lipids, inflammatory factors, and coagulation/fibrinolysis markers.&#xD;
