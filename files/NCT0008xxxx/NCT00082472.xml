  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to show whether inhaled chemotherapy can be added to a standard IV&#xD;
      chemotherapy regime, to investigate the additional toxicities and to show initial evidence of&#xD;
      efficacy of the combination.&#xD;

      Primary Objective of Phase I&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the maximal and Phase II dose of inhaled doxorubicin HCl when given in&#xD;
           combination with IV docetaxel and cisplatin in patients with locally advanced or&#xD;
           metastatic unresectable NSCLC who have not been previously treated with chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective of Phase II&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To obtain preliminary evidence of therapeutic activity using imaging studies in patients&#xD;
           with measurable or evaluable lung lesions and serial measurements of disease-related&#xD;
           pulmonary symptoms and pulmonary function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To define the nature of the toxic effects of inhaled doxorubicin when given in&#xD;
           combination with IV docetaxel and cisplatin.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologic or cytologic proof of locally advanced or metastatic unresectable NSCLC,&#xD;
             Patients with the pneumonic form of BAC, or cavitary lesions &gt; 3.5 cm or with cavitary&#xD;
             lesions of any size with air/fluid levels are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior chemotherapy or biologic therapy for lung cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable or evaluable pulmonary disease required&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status of 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal function&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin &lt; ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  SGOT and/or SGPT may be up to 2.5 x ULN if alkaline phosphatase is ≤ ULN, or alkaline&#xD;
             phosphatase may be up to 4 x ULN if SGOT and SGPT are both ≤ ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine &lt;1.5 mg/dL or creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.7 m2 BSA&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have the following pulmonary function test values:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  DLCO &gt; 50% predicted. (DLCO must be adjusted for the patient's hemoglobin)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  FVC&gt; 50% of predicted&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  FEV1 &gt;50% of predicted&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Resting oxygen saturation &gt; 90%&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Exercise oxygen saturation &gt; 85%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior surgery is permitted provided full recovery has occurred&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not have received prior radiotherapy to the lungs. Patients with only&#xD;
             chest wall or breast irradiation are eligible provided there is no radiographic&#xD;
             evidence of pulmonary damage attributed to radiation therapy. Patients who have&#xD;
             undergone Radioactive Iodine (RAI) therapy are also eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the&#xD;
             investigational nature of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women must not be pregnant or breast-feeding during this study. Men and women with&#xD;

             and agree to use an effective method for three months after completing chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with large obstructive pulmonary lesions that may cause blockage of delivery&#xD;
             of aerosolized drug to the affected lung, in the judgment of the treating physician. A&#xD;
             ventilation scan is recommended if the status is unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with other active malignancies. Patients with a history of prior malignancy&#xD;
             other than NSCLC must not have received chemotherapy within the past 5 years and may&#xD;
             not have had prior therapy with mitomycin (&gt; 25 mg/m2), bleomycin or nitrosoureas (&gt;&#xD;
             200 mg/m2). The patient may not have had any indication of pulmonary toxicity from the&#xD;
             chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious active infections which are not controlled such that the patient continues to&#xD;
             manifest symptoms despite treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with progressive extra-pulmonary metastases who are unlikely to benefit from&#xD;
             systemic or inhaled chemotherapy, e.g., extensive liver metastases, untreated brain&#xD;
             metastases or treated brain metastases which are not clinically stable. If patients&#xD;
             have received radiation treatment for brain metastases, at least 3 weeks must have&#xD;
             elapsed since the last treatment and the patient must have recovered from all&#xD;
             toxicity, not be receiving corticosteroids and have stable neurologic function off&#xD;
             corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity to platinum compounds or taxanes or other drugs&#xD;
             formulated with polysorbate 80&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  asthma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  uncontrolled diabetes mellitus&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have undergone lung transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or symptomatic arrhythmias or any other&#xD;
             serious illness or medical condition that in the judgment of the investigator&#xD;
             compromises the patient's safety&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  clinically significant neuropathy (≥ Grade 1) by history or physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients using other investigational drugs&#xD;
