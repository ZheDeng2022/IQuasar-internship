      This study uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging&#xD;
      (DTI) to examine how the brain processes tasks involving language and emotion in normal&#xD;
      volunteers and in patients with epilepsy. MRI is a diagnostic and research tool that uses a&#xD;
      strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of body organs and tissues. The MRI&#xD;
      scanner is a metal cylinder surrounded by a magnetic field. During the test, the subject lies&#xD;
      on a table that can slide in and out of the cylinder. DTI involves taking pictures of the&#xD;
      brain while the subject is at rest in order to learn about the structure of the brain.&#xD;
      Information gained from this study will help scientists evaluate the organization of language&#xD;
      and emotional functions in the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal volunteers and patients with temporal lobe epilepsy 18 years of age and older who are&#xD;
      native English speakers and who will undergo surgery for uncontrolled seizures may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Candidates are initially screened by telephone, then with physical&#xD;
      and neurologic examinations and cognitive testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has two parts, conducted 6 to 12 months apart. Each part consists of the same sets&#xD;
      of tests described below, using fMRI and DTI. In patients with epilepsy, Part 1 is scheduled&#xD;
      before surgery and Part 2 after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  fMRI: Subjects are asked to perform two types of tasks while they undergo fMRI. In one&#xD;
           task, they are shown pictures of animals and tools and are asked to name them. In a&#xD;
           second task, they are shown pictures that range in content from sexually explicit&#xD;
           material, to human injury and surgical slides, to pleasant images of children and&#xD;
           wildlife and are asked to decide whether they find the pictures pleasant, neutral, or&#xD;
           unpleasant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DTI: Subjects relax and remain still in the MRI scanner for about 45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropsychological testing: Subjects may be asked to complete questionnaires, take&#xD;
           pen-and-paper or computerized tests, and perform motor tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be asked to repeat the MRI studies, but not the neuropsychological tests, up&#xD;
      to four times to investigate different brain functions or to confirm findings.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: Epilepsy surgery is emerging as a potent therapeutic intervention for a large&#xD;
      group of patients with uncontrolled temporal lobe epilepsy, particularly when performed early&#xD;
      in the course of the illness. Seizure freedom is an important goal of seizure surgery, but&#xD;
      post-operative neuropsychological functioning is another equally important outcome measure.&#xD;
      Both endpoints require careful pre-operative evaluation of the individual patient and better&#xD;
      understanding of the functional neuroanatomy of the temporal lobe. In this study fMRI and DTI&#xD;
      will be performed in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and normal volunteers in an attempt&#xD;
      to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. investigate the role of the anterior temporal cortex in semantic processing,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. evaluate the role of the amygdala in affective processing,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. correlate the extent of white matter pathway resection with cognitive outcome after&#xD;
           temporal lobectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION: We plan to study 30 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (right-sided,&#xD;
      left-sided seizure foci) pre and post temporal lobectomy as well as 30 normal volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: The study will be done in two parts both consisting of identical tasks. For the&#xD;
      patient group part 1 will be performed prior to temporal lobectomy and part 2, 6-12 months&#xD;
      after temporal lobectomy. For the normal volunteer group parts 1 and 2 will be performed at&#xD;
      time interval of 6-12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During part 1 all study subjects will undergo neuropsychological evaluation. FMRI will be&#xD;
      performed with two tasks: animal and tool naming (to evaluate semantic processing) and rating&#xD;
      of emotionally pleasant or unpleasant pictures (to evaluate affective processing). All&#xD;
      subjects will also undergo diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for the visualization of white&#xD;
      matter pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During part 2 of the study all of the above tests will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FMRI data will be analyzed within the framework of the general linear model in a program such&#xD;
      as AFNI 2.5. Statistical comparisons between activation patterns in scans acquired during&#xD;
      part 1 and part 2 within either group (intragroup comparison) will be done by voxel wise&#xD;
      paired t-test. In a second analysis all 4 groups will be compared in a mixed model. The DTI&#xD;
      data will be correlated with the neuropsychological outcome to asses the contribution of&#xD;
      white matter abnormalities pre-operatively or severance of white matter pathways&#xD;
      post-operative on neuropsychological functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME PARAMETERS: Outcome parameters are changes in the fMRI activation pattern post&#xD;
      temporal lobectomy and disruption of anisotropy on the diffusion tensor images.&#xD;
