  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore whether the human herpes virus-6 is associated with epileptic&#xD;
      seizures. The virus may be involved in brain scarring, called mesial temporal sclerosis,&#xD;
      which is seen in some epilepsy patients. The virus is also thought possibly to interfere with&#xD;
      neurotransmitters - chemicals that brain cells use to communicate with each other. This study&#xD;
      will measure levels of two of these chemicals, GABA and glutamate, which are believed to play&#xD;
      a role in the development of seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with epilepsy, with or without mesial temporal sclerosis, and healthy control&#xD;
      subjects 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study. Control subjects may not&#xD;
      be taking any medication on a regular basis. Epilepsy patients may take only phenytoin,&#xD;
      carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, or levetiracetam. Candidates are screened with a&#xD;
      physical examination and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants have blood drawn and undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and lumbar&#xD;
      puncture (spinal tap).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Draw&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to four teaspoons of blood are drawn through a needle in the arm for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce pictures of the brain. The scanner is a&#xD;
      metal cylinder surrounded by a strong magnetic field. During the scan, the subject lies on a&#xD;
      bed that slides into the cylinder, wearing earplugs to muffle loud noises the machine makes&#xD;
      when the magnetic fields are switched. The scan takes about 90 to 120 minutes, during which&#xD;
      time the subject can communicate with the technician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lumbar Puncture&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this test the subject sits upright or lies on his or her side with knees curled at the&#xD;
      chest. A local anesthetic is injected at the lower back, and a needle is inserted in the&#xD;
      space between the bones where the cerebrospinal fluid circulates below the spinal cord. A&#xD;
      small amount of fluid is collected through the needle. Collection of the fluid usually takes&#xD;
      from 5 to 20 minutes.&#xD;

      Objective: We would like to demonstrate with this study that the human herpesvirus-6 plays a&#xD;
      role in the development of mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) resulting in epilepsy. We would&#xD;
      also like to examine what influence the virus has on the neurotransmitters glutamate and&#xD;
      GABA, since we believe that an imbalance of the major excitatory and inhibitory&#xD;
      neurotransmitters plays an important role in epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: The study population will consist of adult patients with epilepsy and MTS&#xD;
      and adult patients with epilepsy and no MTS as confirmed on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging&#xD;
      scan of the brain. We will compare findings in these two groups to those in healthy adult&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a natural history study in which we will demonstrate the presence or absence&#xD;
      of human herpesvirus-6 in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained from each of three&#xD;
      adult study groups: patients with epilepsy and MTS, patients with epilepsy and no MTS, and&#xD;
      normal controls. We will measure in all three groups the concentration of GABA and glutamate&#xD;
      in CSF. In all three groups we will perform proton MR spectroscopy to non-invasively measure&#xD;
      these metabolites in the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The three subject groups will be compared in terms of the presence or&#xD;
      absence of the human herpesvirus-6 in the serum and CSF and in terms of the levels of&#xD;
      glutamate and GABA as measured in the CSF and by magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the&#xD;
      hippocampus and temporal lobe.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Subjects of any race or ethnicity will be included in the study. Any subject who has been&#xD;
        diagnosed with medically intractable epilepsy and is eligible for the epilepsy protocol&#xD;
        #01-N-0139 will be evaluated for entry into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients will have a seizure disorder as documented by EEG and video-EEG. Half of&#xD;
             the patients will have radiologically documented mesial temporal sclerosis and the&#xD;
             other half will have a brain MRI without mesial temporal sclerosis. The patients can&#xD;
             only be on phenytoin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine or levetiracetam,&#xD;
             since these anti-epileptic drugs have the least or no effect on the glutamate and GABA&#xD;
             levels in the brain. The patients can not take any other medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy control subjects entering the study must be free of serious disease as&#xD;
             determined by a standard physical and neurological examination. The control subjects&#xD;
             can not be on any medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects must be able to give informed consent allowing us to use the&#xD;
             cerebrospinal fluid and serum for research.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects will have to be able to refrain from chocolate, tea and coffee (low&#xD;
             monoamine diet; Wood et al.1979) and alcohol during the one week before the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be seizure free for 48 hours prior to the lumbar tap and the MRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be excluded if:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They are under the age of 18&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They are female and are pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They have a history of medical disorders which can affect the concentration of&#xD;
             cerebral metabolites, including diabetes mellitus, renal dysfunction, hepatic&#xD;
             dysfunction and electrolyte abnormality&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They take any medication for the normal control group&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They take any medication, with the exception of phenytoin, carbamazepine,&#xD;
             oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine and levetiracetam for the epilepsy patients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They have a history of psychiatric and/or mood disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They have implanted devices such as pacemakers, medication pumps or defibrillators, or&#xD;
             metal in the cranium except for the mouth, intra-cardiac lines, a history of shrapnel&#xD;
             injury or any other condition/device that may be contraindicated or prevent the&#xD;
             acquisition of MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They have a coagulopathy that prevents them from having a lumbar puncture performed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They have had a seizure 48 hours prior to the MRS and the lumbar tap&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who cannot give informed consent allowing us to use the removed fluid for research&#xD;
        will also be excluded.&#xD;
