  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the effects of the glucocorticoid hormone cortisol on brain structure&#xD;
      and function. Patients with Cushing's disease are studied before and after treatment. Brain&#xD;
      imaging and neuropsychologic tests are used to study changes in the hippocampus and thinking&#xD;
      and learning functions as well as mood during the period of elevated cortisol. At several&#xD;
      intervals after treatment, these are reexamined to study the degree of reversibility of the&#xD;
      abnormalities. The contribution of cortisol as well as testosterone and estrogen to&#xD;
      dysfunction and recovery is studied. Since elevated cortisol and dysregulation of its&#xD;
      secretory system occurs in a significant proportion of the aged and in Alzheimers Disease and&#xD;
      Major Depressive Disorder, these studies will help advance knowledge of the role of cortisol&#xD;
      in these conditions.&#xD;
