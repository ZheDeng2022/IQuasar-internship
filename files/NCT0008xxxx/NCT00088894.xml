  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial is studying gemcitabine and bevacizumab to see how well they&#xD;
      work compared to gemcitabine alone in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine, work in different ways to&#xD;
      stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies such as&#xD;
      bevacizumab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances&#xD;
      to them without harming normal cells. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      stopping blood flow to the tumor. Combining gemcitabine with bevacizumab may kill more tumor&#xD;
      cells. It is not yet known whether gemcitabine is more effective with or without bevacizumab&#xD;
      in treating pancreatic cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if combination chemotherapy with gemcitabine and bevacizumab achieves&#xD;
      superior survival compared to gemcitabine and placebo in patients with previously untreated&#xD;
      advanced pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the objective response rates, duration of response, progression free survival,&#xD;
      and toxicity of these two regimens in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To measure baseline levels of VEGF and correlate with treatment outcome. III. To measure&#xD;
      baseline and on treatment levels of additional growth factors that may be co- or counter-&#xD;
      regulated with VEGF and correlate with response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To measure baseline and on treatment levels of coagulation and endothelial cell&#xD;
      activation markers that may predict for thrombotic or bleeding risks related to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To generate protein expression profiles using a MALDI-TOF based platform from serum&#xD;
      samples. To analyze and compare protein expression profiles to elucidate ion peaks that&#xD;
      differentiate patients who respond to therapy from patients who do not respond. To identify&#xD;
      proteins responsible for the differentially expressed ion peaks. To develop quantitative&#xD;
      assays for each of these proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To assess any differences in overall survival within the treatment arm (gemcitabine +&#xD;
      bevacizumab), between the two VEGF genotypic groups: Group 1 denoted by individuals with CT&#xD;
      or TT genotypes and Group 2 consisting of individuals with CC genotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To conduct an exploratory analysis of gene-toxicity, gene-response, and gene-survival&#xD;
      relationships for the various polymorphisms described in the genes implicated in gemcitabine&#xD;
      pharmacology (CDA, DCK, DCTD, SLC29A1, SLC28A1, SLC29A2). An exploratory quantitative&#xD;
      interaction between the genotypes (group 1 or 2) and the treatment arms (gemcitabine +&#xD;
      bevacizumab or gemcitabine + placebo) in predicting overall survival will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To identify specific SNPs and genetic variation that are associated with differences&#xD;
      among patients in the risk of toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. To compare the effects of gemcitabine + bevacizumab versus gemcitabine + placebo on&#xD;
      resource utilization, cost, and utilities, and if applicable, to make estimates of marginal&#xD;
      cost-utility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients&#xD;
      are stratified according to ECOG performance status (0-1 vs 2), disease extent (metastatic vs&#xD;
      locally advanced), and prior radiotherapy (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2&#xD;
      treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm I: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and bevacizumab&#xD;
      IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine IV as in arm I and placebo IV over 30-90 minutes on days&#xD;
      1 and 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 590 patients (295 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this&#xD;
      study within 26.8 months.&#xD;
