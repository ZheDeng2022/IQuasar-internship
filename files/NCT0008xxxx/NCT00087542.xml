  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to demonstrate that the investigational new drug, ACP-103, is well&#xD;
      tolerated by, and will not worsen parkinsonism in, patients with Parkinson's disease and&#xD;
      psychosis. The secondary objectives are to determine whether ACP-103 will ameliorate&#xD;
      psychosis in patients with Parkinson's disease and whether ACP-103 is safe in Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease patients taking multiple anti-parkinsonian medications.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of four&#xD;
      weeks of ACP-103 treatment of psychosis in Parkinson's disease, with four weeks follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 60 patients meeting entrance criteria will be randomly assigned to receive placebo&#xD;
      (30 patients) or active drug (30 patients). Subjects will take study drug daily starting on&#xD;
      Day 1. Dose escalations can occur on Study Days 8 and 15 only, and patients will receive a&#xD;
      stable daily dosage from Day 16 until Day 28. Single step dose reductions are allowed during&#xD;
      that period for adverse events or intolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated at screening/baseline and at Study Days 1, 8, 15, 28, and 57 by&#xD;
      raters blinded to the treatment. The major response variable will be motoric tolerability.&#xD;
      Secondary response variables will be efficacy against psychosis and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are no approved drugs for this indication in the United States. Psychotic&#xD;
      symptoms in Parkinson's disease patients are almost always stable, often non-threatening, and&#xD;
      rarely paranoid or violent in content. The trial includes the requirement that each patient&#xD;
      enrolled has a reliable caretaker who will accompany the patient to each visit who can&#xD;
      reliably report on the patient's daily level of function. These factors argue for the safe&#xD;
      inclusion of a four-week period of placebo treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Male and female patients of any ethnic group and of any age are eligible for participation&#xD;
        in this study, providing they meet all the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, defined as the&#xD;
             presence of at least three of the cardinal features of the disease including: rest&#xD;
             tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia and/or akinesia, postural balance abnormalities, in the&#xD;
             absence of alternative explanations or atypical features.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psychosis, defined by the presence of visual and/or auditory hallucinations, with or&#xD;
             without delusions, of at least four weeks duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psychosis, assessed by items A and B of the NPI, and defined as Hallucinations&#xD;
             (Frequency x Severity) and Delusions (Frequency x Severity) = a total score of 4 or&#xD;
             greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stable anti-Parkinsonian medication(s) use for at least one week prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A reliable caretaker who will accompany the subject to each visit, and who can&#xD;
             reliably report on the subject's daily level of function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who meet any of the following conditions are excluded from the clinical study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability of subject or caretaker to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding. Female subjects of child-bearing potential must have a&#xD;
             negative urine pregnancy test at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects must be of non-childbearing potential or must comply with&#xD;
             double-barrier protection methods against conception during the study and for at least&#xD;
             one month prior to randomization and one month following completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of any systemic factor contributing to the psychosis such as urinary&#xD;
             infection, liver disease, renal failure, anemia, infection, etc. as defined by a&#xD;

&#xD;
