      This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of daclizumab (also called Zenapax or&#xD;
      anti-CD25) in reducing viral replication in patients with HIV infection. Although HAART, an&#xD;
      intensive anti-HIV treatment regimen, can suppress HIV in blood below the limit of detection,&#xD;
      it cannot completely eradicate the virus. This study will focus on the effectiveness of&#xD;
      daclizumab in further reducing viral replication in patients with low viral counts. The Food&#xD;
      and Drug Administration approved daclizumab in 1997 for preventing kidney transplant&#xD;
      rejection, and it has also been studied in people with an eye infection called uveitis. The&#xD;
      drug works by binding to a protein on T cells (white blood cells of the immune system) called&#xD;
      CD25. This prevents another protein, called interleukin-2 (IL-2), from binding to this site,&#xD;
      thus preventing a series of events that normally results in inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients between 18 and 65 years of age with HIV infection who have stable HIV levels at less&#xD;
      than 30,000 copies/mL of blood and CD4 T cell counts higher than 400 cells/cmm may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Patients who have taken drugs that affect the immune system, such as&#xD;
      IL-2 and interferon, in the past 5 years may not participate. Candidates are screened with a&#xD;
      comprehensive medical examination, including physical examination and laboratory studies.&#xD;
      X-rays, consultations, and biopsies are done only if medically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daclizumab therapy: Patients receive daclizumab as a 25-minute infusion through an&#xD;
           intravenous catheter (plastic tube placed in a vein) at the NIH Clinical Center&#xD;
           outpatient clinic. A total of three doses of drug are given. The first dose is given on&#xD;
           study day 1, the second dose is given 2 weeks later, and the third dose is given 4 weeks&#xD;
           later. Patients are observed for at least 1 hour after each infusion before being&#xD;
           discharged from the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up visits: Patients return to the outpatient clinic every 2 weeks while they are&#xD;
           on medication and then every month until 3 months after the final dose to evaluate their&#xD;
           infection status, response to therapy, and medication side effects. The visits include a&#xD;
           physical examination, blood draws, and possibly x-rays, if medically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Apheresis: Patients undergo apheresis, a procedure for collecting large amounts of white&#xD;
           blood cells, three times during the study - once before starting daclizumab therapy, 4&#xD;
           weeks after beginning therapy, and 12 weeks after beginning therapy. For apheresis,&#xD;
           blood is removed through a needle in the vein of one arm and spun in a machine that&#xD;
           separates it into its components. The white blood cells and plasma are removed, and the&#xD;
           red cells and platelets are re-infused either through the same needle or through a&#xD;
           needle in a vein in the other arm.&#xD;

      The purpose of this protocol is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of an&#xD;
      immunosuppressive agent, daclizumab, in HIV-infected adults. HIV-infected individuals with&#xD;
      levels of plasma viremia below 30,000 copies/mL will receive daclizumab for one month.&#xD;
      Various immunologic and virologic laboratory studies addressing the state of cellular&#xD;
      activation and toxicity data will be collected post-enrollment. The primary study risks&#xD;
      include factors associated with immunosuppression and fluctuation on HIV viral levels.&#xD;
      Subjects will be compensated for participation in this study. Total enrollment for the study&#xD;
      will be a maximum of 10 subjects.&#xD;
