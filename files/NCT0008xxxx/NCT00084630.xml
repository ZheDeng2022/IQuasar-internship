      This phase II trial is studying how well imatinib mesylate works in treating patients with&#xD;
      locally recurrent or metastatic dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) or transformed&#xD;
      fibrosarcomatous DFSP (a type of soft tissue sarcoma). Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth&#xD;
      of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the response rate (confirmed complete and confirmed partial response) in&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) treated&#xD;
      with imatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the one-year progression-free survival probability in this population when&#xD;
      treated with imatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the frequency and severity of toxicities associated with this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To measure the presence of PDGFB gene rearrangement in DFSP detectable by RT-PCR (for&#xD;
      COL1A1-PDGFB fusions) and/or FISH (PDGFB rearrangements with unknown partners) and explore&#xD;
      relationships between these measures and survival and tumor response in a preliminary manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To investigate in a preliminary fashion the correlation of plasma levels of imatinib after&#xD;
      1 month of treatment with the response of DFSP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To obtain tumor material for additional future correlative studies of the activity of&#xD;
      intracellular kinases, cDNA microarray analyses and PDGFB receptor gene sequence analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily on days 1-56. Treatment repeats every 56&#xD;
      days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients&#xD;
      with documented tumor progression and no serious side effects may continue therapy at a&#xD;
      higher dose for another 6 courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and then annually for 3 years.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed diagnosis of either dermatofibrosarcoma&#xD;
             protuberans (DFSP) or transformed fibrosarcomatous DFSP; patients with transformed&#xD;
             fibrosarcomatous DFSP may have primary, locally recurrent or metastatic disease;&#xD;
             patients with DFSP must have locally recurrent or metastatic disease OR primary&#xD;
             disease for which complete excision with a wide margin (&gt; 1-2 cm) would result in&#xD;
             unacceptable cosmetic disfigurement or functional impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease; x-rays, scans or physical examinations used for&#xD;
             tumor measurement must have been completed within 28 days prior to registration;&#xD;
             x-rays, scans or other tests for assessment of non-measurable disease must have been&#xD;
             performed within 42 days prior to registration; all disease must be assessed&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must not be taking therapeutic doses of coumadin (Warfarin) at the time of&#xD;
             registration; patients requiring therapeutic anticoagulation may use heparin, low&#xD;
             molecular weight heparin or other agents; mini-dose coumadin (1 mg orally every day as&#xD;
             prophylaxis is allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known CNS metastases are not eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing women may not participate on this study; there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with imatinib; male/female patients of reproductive potential must also agree&#xD;
             to employ an effective contraceptive barrier method of birth control throughout the&#xD;
