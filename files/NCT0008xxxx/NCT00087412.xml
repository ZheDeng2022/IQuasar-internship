  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well erlotinib works in treating patients with advanced&#xD;
      primary non-small cell lung cancer. Erlotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking&#xD;
      the enzymes necessary for their growth&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess survival in patients with advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma with a Zubrod&#xD;
      Performance Status of 2 treated with OSI-774.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the objective tumor response rates (confirmed plus unconfirmed, complete and&#xD;
      partial), in patients with advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma with a Zubrod Performance&#xD;
      Status of 2 treated with OSI-774.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To investigate in a preliminary manner possible correlations of EGFR expression,&#xD;
      mutations, and/or EGFR polymorphisms with response and/or survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To investigate in a preliminary manner possible correlations of activated signal pathway&#xD;
      molecules, including basal p27 expression levels with response and/or survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral erlotinib once daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.&#xD;

             irradiation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with brain metastases are ineligible; all patients with neurological&#xD;
             abnormalities on physical exam or symptoms must have a negative pretreatment CT or MRI&#xD;
             scan of the brain within 28 days prior to registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease documented by CT, MRI, X-ray, physical exam or&#xD;
             nuclear exam within 28 days prior to registration; non-measurable disease must be&#xD;

             recovered from all associated toxicities; measurable disease must be present outside&#xD;
             the previous radiation field or a new lesion must be present&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have received prior surgery provided that at least three weeks have&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Alkaline phosphatase =&lt; 4 x the IULN and liver enzymes (SGOT or SGPT) =&lt; the IULN&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in an inability to&#xD;

             disease (e.g., Crohn's, ulcerative colitis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have completed the prestudy Medical Conditions Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients are not required to complete the Medical Conditions Questionnaire if&#xD;
                  they are unable to read and understand English&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Correlative science studies: institutions must have received IRB approval of S9925&#xD;
             (the Lung Cancer Specimen Repository); patients must be offered participation in&#xD;
             S9925; with the patient's consent, blood, plasma and tissue will be submitted for&#xD;
             testing via S9925; patients must be registered separately to S9925 in order for&#xD;
             institutions to receive credit for specimen submission&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have a significant history of cardiac disease, i.e., uncontrolled&#xD;
             high blood pressure, unstable angina, congestive-heart failure, myocardial infraction&#xD;

             next working day&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In calculating days of tests and measurements, the day a test or measurement is&#xD;
                  done is considered day 0; therefore, if a test is done on a Monday, the Monday&#xD;
                  four weeks later would be considered day 28; this allows for efficient patient&#xD;
                  scheduling without exceeding the guidelines&#xD;

             and give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal&#xD;
             guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At the time of patient registration, the treating institution's name and ID number&#xD;
             must be provided to the Data Operations Center in Seattle in order to ensure that the&#xD;
             current (within 365 days) date of institutional review board approval for this study&#xD;
             has been entered into the data base&#xD;
