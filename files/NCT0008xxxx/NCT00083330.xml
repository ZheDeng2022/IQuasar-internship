    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety of an experimental vaccine against HIV infection and see if&#xD;
      it causes an immune response to HIV. The vaccine is given by injection (shot) in the upper&#xD;
      arm. It is made from DNA that codes for three HIV proteins. The DNA is inserted into an&#xD;
      adenovirus that carries it into the muscle cells. The adenovirus normally can cause eye or&#xD;
      upper respiratory infections, such as a cold; however, for the vaccine, it has been modified&#xD;
      so that it cannot cause illness. Nor can the vaccine cause HIV infection, because it codes&#xD;
      for only three of the nine HIV proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy, normal volunteers between 18 and 44 years of age who are not HIV-infected may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical&#xD;
      examination and blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomly assigned to receive either the experimental vaccine or a placebo&#xD;
      (an inactive substance that looks like the vaccine). The vaccine or placebo is administered&#xD;
      to participants in groups, according to their entry into the study. The first group receives&#xD;
      the lowest study dose of vaccine. If this dose is safe, then the second group receives a&#xD;
      higher dose. If this dose is also safe, then the third and final group receives the highest&#xD;
      study dose. Clinic staff observe the subjects for side effects for 30 minutes after the&#xD;
      injection, and subjects keep a diary card for the next 5 days, recording their temperature&#xD;
      and any symptoms that may appear. Subjects are contacted by a nurse 2 days after the&#xD;
      injection for follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are seen at the clinic for follow-up visits 1, 2, 4, 12, and 24 weeks after the&#xD;
      injection, and then are contacted by telephone for follow-up once a year until 5 years after&#xD;
      the injection. The clinic visits include a physical examination, medical history, blood and&#xD;
      urine tests, and HIV counseling, as needed. Women have pregnancy tests at the screening&#xD;
      evaluation and again at study week 24. All subjects are tested for HIV at screening and at&#xD;
      study weeks 12 and 24, and all subjects complete a &quot;social impact questionnaire&quot; at week 24.&#xD;
      All subjects are asked questions about their sexual behavior and drug use.&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase I, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study to examine safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and immune response of a multiclade HIV adenoviral vector vaccine in uninfected&#xD;
      adults. The hypothesis is that this vaccine will be safe and elicit immune responses to HIV.&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP in&#xD;
      uninfected subjects and the secondary objectives include immunogenicity evaluations and&#xD;
      adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) antibody titers through Week 4 and social impacts at Week 24.&#xD;
      Exploratory evaluations include immunogenicity evaluations at Weeks 12 and 24 and Ad5&#xD;
      antibody titers at Week 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP is a recombinant product composed of 4 adenoviral vectors (Ad) (in a&#xD;
      3:1:1:1 ratio) that encode the HIV-1 Gag/Pol polyprotein from clade B and HIV-1 Env&#xD;
      glycoproteins from clades A, B, and C, respectively. The final formulation buffer,&#xD;
      VRC-DILUENT013-DIL-VP will be used as the diluent and as the placebo control. Injections will&#xD;
      be administered intramuscularly (IM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adult volunteers (18 to 44 years old).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty-six volunteers will receive one 1.0 mL injection of the study agent or placebo in a&#xD;
      deltoid muscle as shown in the schema. Dose escalation will occur about three weeks after the&#xD;
      last injection in a dose group following an interim safety data review by a DSMB, provided&#xD;
      that there are no significant toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be evaluated at 5 or more clinical visits for 24 weeks after the study&#xD;
      injection, followed by annual telephone or mail contact for the subsequent 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is safety of the vaccine administered at doses of 1 x 10(9), 1 x 10(10)&#xD;
      and 1 x 10(11) particle units (PU) by intramuscular injection. Secondary endpoints are&#xD;
      immunogenicity as indicated by HIV-specific antibody and cellular immune responses through&#xD;
      Week 4, Ad5 antibody titer at Week 0 and Week 4 and social impact at Week 24. Exploratory&#xD;
      analyses of immunogenicity at Weeks 12 and 24 and Ad5 antibody titer at Week 24 will also be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
