      This study will evaluate the safety and usefulness of omalizumab (anti-IgE, Xolair) in&#xD;
      reducing eosinophil counts and improving symptoms in patients with eosinophilic&#xD;
      gastroenteritis (EG). EG is a disorder of unknown cause in which eosinophils, a type of white&#xD;
      blood cell, are increased in the blood and gut tissue. Patients with EG have symptoms like&#xD;
      stomach pain, bloating, and vomiting. About 50 percent of EG patients have food or&#xD;
      environmental allergies, which may play a role in EG. Some patients with EG improve&#xD;
      significantly on diets avoiding foods to which they are allergic. Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is&#xD;
      an antibody that plays an important role in initiating allergic reactions. Omalizumab is a&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody directed against IgE. The Food and Drug Administration approved&#xD;
      omalizumab in 2003 for treating patients 12 years of age and older with allergic asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients between 12 and 76 years of age with eosinophilic gastroenteritis who have a blood&#xD;
      eosinophil count of 500 or more and who have a food allergy or allergy to an inhaled allergen&#xD;
      may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical&#xD;
      examination, and blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Leukapheresis. This procedure is done to collect quantities of white blood cells to&#xD;
           study the effects of omalizumab on eosinophils and other immune substances. Blood flows&#xD;
           from a needle placed in an arm vein through a catheter (plastic tube) into a machine&#xD;
           that separates the blood into its components by centrifugation (spinning). Some of the&#xD;
           white cells are removed and the rest of the blood (red cells, plasma and platelets) is&#xD;
           returned to the body through a needle in the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin testing. Participants are tested for allergies to specific substances. A small&#xD;
           amount of various allergens (substances that cause allergies) are placed on the&#xD;
           subject's arm. The skin is pricked at the sites of the allergens and the skin reaction&#xD;
           after several minutes is observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Upper and lower endoscopy. One or both of these procedures is done, depending on the&#xD;
           part of the gastrointestinal tract that is involved, to examine the tract. If both&#xD;
           procedures are done, they are performed at the same time. For the upper endoscopy, the&#xD;
           subject's throat is sprayed with a numbing medicine and a long, flexible tube is passed&#xD;
           through the esophagus, stomach and small intestine. For the lower endoscopy, the tube is&#xD;
           passed through the rectum into t...&#xD;

      Eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EG) is characterized by eosinophilic infiltration of the bowel&#xD;
      wall, gastrointestinal symptoms, and in more than 50% of patients, peripheral eosinophilia.&#xD;
      Approximately one half of EG patients have multiple food allergies and/or elevated&#xD;
      immunoglobulin E (IgE), suggesting an allergic etiology. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of humanized monoclonal anti-IgE antibody, omalizumab&#xD;
      (Xolair (Registered Trademark)), in eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Omalizumab is approved for&#xD;
      use in asthma and is dosed subcutaneously based on serum total IgE level and body weight,&#xD;
      with a maximum dose of 375 mg every 2 weeks. Subjects with EG, and either food&#xD;
      hypersensitivity or environmental allergies will be admitted to the Clinical Center. All&#xD;
      subjects will undergo a thorough clinical evaluation, including endoscopy. The primary&#xD;
      endpoints will be the evaluation of safety of omalizumab and its efficacy in reducing&#xD;
      peripheral blood absolute eosinophil count. In addition, the following secondary endpoints&#xD;
      will be studied: symptom scores, study drug pharmacodynamics, and tissue eosinophilia. Blood&#xD;
      cells and serum will be collected and evaluated in the laboratory to address issues related&#xD;
      to the immunopathogenesis and treatment of EG. This study will provide a better understanding&#xD;
      of inflammatory and allergy mediators in the pathogenesis of EG and may provide a potential&#xD;
      therapy for EG. Following subcutaneous administration of the initial dose of omalizumab&#xD;
      (maximum 375 mg), subjects will be followed as inpatients for a minimum of 24 hours to&#xD;
      monitor for adverse effects. Subsequent doses will be administered biweekly for a total of 8&#xD;
      doses.&#xD;
