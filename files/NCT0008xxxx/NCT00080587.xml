      This study will compare changes in atherosclerotic plaque in the coronary arteries (vessels&#xD;
      on the surface of the heart that supply blood to the heart) with changes in the carotid&#xD;
      arteries (vessels in the neck that supply blood to the brain) in patients enrolled in a&#xD;
      Pfizer-sponsored treatment trial for coronary artery disease. Atherosclerosis is a buildup of&#xD;
      fatty deposits (plaque) in arteries that can lead to blockage of the vessel, possibly&#xD;
      resulting in heart attack or stroke. A major question in cardiovascular disease is how&#xD;
      closely atherosclerotic changes in the coronary arteries correlate with changes in the&#xD;
      carotid artery that occur with treatment. substudy of a Pfizer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in the Pfizer trial comparing the effectiveness of the drug atorvastatin&#xD;
      with a combination of atorvastatin and CETP inhibitor (a drug to increase HDL cholesterol&#xD;
      levels) may be eligible for this substudy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound of the carotid arteries&#xD;
      to measure the thickness of the vessels. The results are then compared with the coronary&#xD;
      artery images obtained as part of the patient's evaluation for the Pfizer trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI scans use a powerful magnet with an advanced computer system and radio waves to produce&#xD;
      accurate, detailed pictures of organs and tissues. During the scan the patient lies on a&#xD;
      table in a narrow cylinder containing a magnetic field, wearing earplugs to muffle loud&#xD;
      noises that occur with electrical switching of the magnetic fields. A medicine called&#xD;
      gadolinium contrast may be injected into a vein during part of the scan to brighten the&#xD;
      images. The scan takes about 30 to 90 minutes. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is done during the&#xD;
      scan to monitor the heart's electrical activity. Patients who agree to undergo another MRI&#xD;
      test are also imaged in a scanner that uses a stronger (3 Tesla) magnet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
      An echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) uses sound waves to image the carotid arteries. A&#xD;
      gel is applied to the area of the neck to be imaged and a small handheld ultrasound probe is&#xD;
      held against the neck to take the pictures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants return after 2 years for a second set of tests.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Under the general hypothesis that atherosclerosis is a systemic disease; the purpose of this&#xD;
      protocol is to compare coronary artery atherosclerotic abnormalities with carotid artery&#xD;
      abnormalities. This is an NHLBI sponsored sub study to the Pfizer sponsored trial comparing&#xD;
      atorvastatin or the combination of atorvastatin/CETP inhibitor as treatments for patients&#xD;
      with coronary heart disease. The primary study is a multicenter, randomized, double blind,&#xD;
      active-controlled study which uses intracoronary ultrasound to measure coronary plaque volume&#xD;
      during the course of treatment. The scientific value of the NHLBI sub study will be the&#xD;
      comparison of atherosclerotic abnormalities in two different vascular beds, the coronary&#xD;
      artery and the carotid arteries. This study will examine correlations between invasive&#xD;
      coronary measurements by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), with 2-dimensional measurements of&#xD;
      wall thickness by carotid intimal medial wall thickness (IMT), and with 3-dimensional&#xD;
      measurements of carotid wall volume by MRI and 3D ultrasound. Secondary analysis will probe&#xD;
      whether carotid plaque characteristics can predict atheroma regression. Secondary analysis&#xD;
      will also assess the ability of noninvasive carotid measures to predict the degree of&#xD;
      coronary regression determined in the coronary arteries by IVUS. It is important to note that&#xD;
      the NHLBI study design remains blinded to the treatment group a subject is enrolled in since&#xD;
      the sample size for a single center study is too small to detect the conservatively estimated&#xD;
      additional benefit of combination atorvastatin/CETP inhibitor treatment over the already&#xD;
      effective atorvastatin alone. Thus, the NHLBI sub study is primarily a pathophysiological&#xD;
      study correlating carotid and coronary atherosclerotic changes as well as a technological&#xD;
      comparison of IVU, carotid IMT, and carotid vessel wall volume by MRI. If successful, this&#xD;
      study could provide the framework for following treatment trials of this nature with&#xD;
      noninvasive tools, either ultrasound or MRI, in place of the accurate but invasive IVUS.&#xD;
