  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An experimental treatment with OvaRex® MAb-B43.13 (oregovomab), called immunotherapy is being&#xD;
      tested in ovarian cancer patients. Immunotherapy causes the body's defenses to react against&#xD;
      cancer cells. The purpose of this research study is to determine if immunotherapy with&#xD;
      oregovomab can create an immune response and enable the body to fight the disease and help&#xD;
      ovarian cancer patients live longer. Patients with a possible diagnosis of ovarian cancer&#xD;
      will be screened for study participation pre-surgery and, if eligible, will receive&#xD;
      oregovomab during front-line chemotherapy treatment for ovarian cancer and quarterly for&#xD;
      about a year following chemotherapy. Patients who experience disease progression will be&#xD;
      discontinued from oregovomab therapy. Patients will also have urine, blood and tissue samples&#xD;
      collected to assess the immune response to oregovomab.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A histologic diagnosis of primary peritoneal carcinoma or epithelial ovarian&#xD;
             carcinoma, Stage III - IV, expressing the tumor-associated antigen CA125 as measured&#xD;
             by a serum CA125 level ≥ 35 U/mL and tumor tissue which has been demonstrated by&#xD;
             immunohistochemical methods to express CA125. All patients must provide primary tumor&#xD;
             (and lymph node and ascites samples, if available) samples for cellular immunology&#xD;
             assays and characterization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A functional performance status of ≤2 on the ECOG scale&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are randomized into the study no more than eight (8) weeks postoperatively&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an expected survival of at least 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age less than or equal to 80 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have given written informed consent, prior to any study-related procedure not part of&#xD;
             normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the&#xD;
             patient at any time without prejudice to their future medical care&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received radiotherapy or chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have circumstances at the time of entry onto the protocol would not permit completion&#xD;
             of study or require follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have other invasive malignancies, with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancer and&#xD;
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix, who had (or have) any evidence of the other cancer&#xD;
             present within the last 5 years or whose previous cancer treatment contraindicates&#xD;
             this protocol therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have significant cardiovascular abnormalities [uncontrolled hypertension, Congestive&#xD;
             Heart Failure (CHF) New York Heart Association (NYHA) Classes II-IV, see Appendix C),&#xD;
             uncontrolled angina, myocardial infarction within the past six months or uncontrolled&#xD;
             arrhythmias]. Patients with evidence of abnormal cardiac conduction (e.g. bundle&#xD;
             branch block, heart block) are eligible if their disease has been stable for the past&#xD;
             six months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an active autoimmune disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, Systemic Lupus&#xD;
             Erythematosus (SLE), ulcerative colitis, Crohn's Disease, MS, ankylosing spondylitis)&#xD;
             requiring active immunosuppressive therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a known allergy to murine proteins or have had a documented anaphylactic reaction&#xD;
             to any drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are being chronically treated with immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin,&#xD;
             Adrenocorticotrophic Hormone (ACTH), or systemic corticosteroids&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a recognized immunodeficiency disease including cellular immunodeficiencies,&#xD;
             hypogammaglobulinemia or dysgammaglobulinemia; patients who have acquired, hereditary,&#xD;
             congenital immunodeficiencies, Human Immunodeficiency Virus, or status post&#xD;
             splenectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an uncontrolled disease (e.g. deteriorating renal function or nephropathy, active&#xD;
             hepatitis, etc.) other than cancer. Patients with chronic diseases that are well&#xD;
             controlled (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypertension) are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are taking mono-amine oxidase inhibitors or who have other contraindications to the&#xD;
             use of pressor agents (e.g. epinephrine)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are unable to read or understand, and/or unwilling to sign a written consent form&#xD;
             which must be obtained prior to surgery and prior to treatment Surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will not be required to undergo second-look surgery (such surgery will be at&#xD;
             the option of the investigator)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If patients undergo a second surgical procedure for a clinically indicated&#xD;
             circumstance, an interval tumor sample with ascites and lymph node (if available)&#xD;
             should be obtained, if present, for immunological evaluation and provided to the study&#xD;
