      To test whether specific genes affect lipoprotein and weight responses to vigorous exercise&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well recognized that increased exercise is associated with a number of health benefits,&#xD;
      which include decreases in level of obesity and improvement in lipoprotein levels.&#xD;
      Differences have been found to exist, however, in individual response to increased exercise,&#xD;
      suggesting that genetic factors may be involved in mediating this response. The elucidation&#xD;
      of both the specific genes responsible for these differences and the manner by which they&#xD;
      interact with increased exercise to influence lipoprotein levels and body weight would&#xD;
      contribute significantly to increasing current understanding of the way in which genes and&#xD;
      environment operate to determine these characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the National Runners' Health Study, Dr. Williams and colleagues have identified&#xD;
      1,350 runners who have an identical (MZ) twin. Their recruitment experience shows that an&#xD;
      additional 3,120 MZ twins can be located nationally through Runner's World race participation&#xD;
      program.Twenty-eight percent of these MZ twin pairs are expected to be discordant for&#xD;
      vigorous exercise (sedentary versus running over 10 miles per week) and otherwise eligible&#xD;
      for study. The investigators propose to obtain blood for genotyping, detailed lipoprotein&#xD;
      subfraction measurements, clinic weights, and proximal (diet record) and long-term (food&#xD;
      frequency questionnaire) nutrient intakes in 400 discordant MZ twin pairs to test whether&#xD;
      genes affect the lipoprotein and weight response to vigorous exercise. The analyses assume&#xD;
      that the sedentary twin represents (theoretically) the body weight and lipoprotein&#xD;
      concentrations of the active twin if he or she were sedentary. They will compare the co-twin&#xD;
      lipoprotein and weight differences across genotypes after adjusting for diet. Candidate genes&#xD;
      will include single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have been identified by others to&#xD;
      affect lipoproteins, weight, propensity to exercise, or that mitigate the responses of&#xD;
      lipoproteins to exercise. They will also compare the co-twin phenotype differences to SNPs&#xD;
      and haplotypes that linkage disequilibrium maps suggest characterize most of the major&#xD;
      genetic variation for genes affecting lipoprotein metabolism. The lipoproteins will include&#xD;
      detailed measurements of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)&#xD;
      subclasses using gradient gel electrophoresis. The individual HDL subclasses will also be&#xD;
      analyzed after separating the HDL by immunoaffinity chromatography into particles containing&#xD;
      both apo A-I and apo A-II (HDL(A-I with A-II)) and those containing apo A-I and no apo A-II&#xD;
      (HDL(A-I without A-II)). The design provides the advantages of both the cross-sectional&#xD;
      association studies (large phenotypic effects) and the training studies (controlling for&#xD;
      genotype) without the self-selection bias of cross-sectional association studies or the small&#xD;
      phenotypic response of training studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Their first pilot study of 35 pairs of MZ twins revealed a 5.2 mg/dL difference in&#xD;
      HDL-cholesterol and a 12 pound weight difference between the active and sedentary twin. By&#xD;
      comparison, a major recent training study produced only small average increases in HDL&#xD;
      cholesterol (men:l.1 mg/dL; women:l.4 mg/dL) and small decreases in weight (men: 0.9 pounds;&#xD;
      women: 0.4 pounds) after 20 weeks of training. The larger effect size of the discordant twin&#xD;
      study will provide greater statistical power to detect gene-environment interactions than the&#xD;
      training study. DNA samples will be shared with other institutions to cross-validate gene&#xD;
      associations identified from training studies or other designs.&#xD;
