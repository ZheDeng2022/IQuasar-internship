      This study will examine the usefulness of a new test called an isoproterenol challenge in&#xD;
      patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) and family members who&#xD;
      may have the disease but do not have clear-cut evidence of it. ARVC is a rare condition that&#xD;
      runs in families. Heart muscle is replaced with fatty, scar-like tissue, especially in the&#xD;
      right ventricle (lower pumping chamber of the heart), and can sometimes extend to the left&#xD;
      ventricle (the main pumping chamber). The fat can interfere with the heartbeat, producing&#xD;
      abnormal heart rhythms, such as ventricular tachycardia (VT) - a very fast heartbeat that can&#xD;
      cause sudden death, especially in young people. Isoproterenol is a drug that increases heart&#xD;
      rate and heart muscle contractions. In isoproterenol challenge, subjects are given increasing&#xD;
      doses of the drug through a catheter (see details below) to try to produce an abnormal heart&#xD;
      rhythm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARVC is hard to diagnose with current tests. This study will see if isoproterenol challenge&#xD;
      provokes VT in patients with the disease and can confirm the diagnosis; if it can detect the&#xD;
      disease in family members better than currently available tests; and if it provokes abnormal&#xD;
      rhythms in healthy control subjects. In addition, the study will explore the genetics of ARVC&#xD;
      and determine whether infection could contribute to its development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with ARVC, their family members, and normal volunteers 18 years of age and older may&#xD;
      be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical&#xD;
      examination, electrocardiogram (EKG), treadmill and bicycle exercise testing, and an&#xD;
      echocardiogram (ultrasound test of the heart).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests - Blood is collected to study the genetics of ARVC, to test for evidence of&#xD;
           old infections, and to measure brain natriuretic peptide - a hormone that can increase&#xD;
           with development of heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This test looks at heart structure and function.&#xD;
           MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of body tissues and organs.&#xD;
           The subject lies on a table that is moved into the scanner (a narrow cylinder), wearing&#xD;
           earplugs to muffle loud knocking sounds that occur during the scanning process. At some&#xD;
           time during the test, the subject is given a contrast agent called gadolinium through a&#xD;
           catheter (thin, flexible tube) in a vein to improve the scan pictures. The scan time&#xD;
           varies from 30 to 90 minutes, with most scans lasting 60 minutes. (Control subjects do&#xD;
           not undergo MRI.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Isoproterenol challenge. Subjects are given increasing doses of isoproterenol through a&#xD;
           catheter until the heart rate reaches 100 to 120 beats per minute for no more than 1&#xD;
           hour. A special EKG records heart rhythm during the test and an echocardiogram records&#xD;
           right and left ventricular function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  QRST surface mapping EKG. This special EKG, done with 64 or 120 leads, maps&#xD;
           abnormalities of heart rhythm and cardiac conduction during the isoproterenol challenge.&#xD;
           These tests are like a regular EKG, except that more leads are placed on the chest, and&#xD;
           on the back as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and family members who wish to have follow-up visits may return to the NIH Clinical&#xD;
      Center once a year for 5 years for guidance about therapy based on clinical considerations&#xD;
      and new information or investigations.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) formerly referred to as arrhythmogenic&#xD;
      right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) is a familial hetergenous clinical and molecular disease&#xD;
      characterized by dilatation and dysfunction of the right ventricle and ventricular&#xD;
      arrhythmias. The ventricular arrhythmias are heart rate and catecholamine dependent. Not&#xD;
      infrequently, there is involvement of the left ventricle. The diagnosis of ARVC is critical&#xD;
      as therapy including implantable defibrillators may prevent sudden death. However,&#xD;
      identification of affected family members remains a major challenge due to limitation of&#xD;
      current imaging and diagnostic techniques. We propose (1) to establish the sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of the isoproterenol challenge test for ARVC by testing both patients with known&#xD;
      ARVC and healthy volunteers; (2) to estimate the proportion of family members who present&#xD;
      with incomplete criteria for ARVC but are subsequently diagnosed with the condition by an&#xD;
      isoproterenol challenge test; and, (3) to study the inheritance of ARVC and the potential&#xD;
      role of occult infection in its development.&#xD;
