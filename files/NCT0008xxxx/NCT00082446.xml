  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goals of this study are to expand the available data on the safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of MVA-BN in vaccinia-naive adults and to determine the optimum dose of MVA-BN&#xD;
      to induce immune responses and attenuate Dryvax take reactions. Participants will include 90&#xD;
      healthy volunteers, ages 18-32 years. Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 6 study&#xD;
      groups (groups A-F). Participants will be involved in study related procedures for up to 2&#xD;
      years. During this time, volunteers will return periodically for blood draws to check immune&#xD;
      responses.&#xD;

      The primary goal of this phase I trial is to expand the available data on the safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of MVA-BN in vaccinia-naïve adults. The secondary goals of this vaccine trial&#xD;
      are: to determine the optimum dose of MVA-BN, given twice, to induce an immune response and&#xD;
      attenuate Dryvax® take reactions; and to compare the ability of 2 routes of administration of&#xD;
      MVA-BN, subcutaneous and intramuscular, to induce an immune response at the highest tested&#xD;
      dose. A total of 90 healthy adult volunteers ages 18-32 will participate in this study. The&#xD;
      volunteers will be randomly assigned to 1 of 6 groups to be immunized with: MVA-BN&#xD;
      (subcutaneously) at 1 of 3 dose levels and Dryvax® (per scarification); placebo&#xD;
      (subcutaneously) and Dryvax® (per scarification); MVA-BN (subcutaneously) at the highest dose&#xD;
      level and placebo scarification; or MVA-BN (intramuscularly) at the highest dose level and&#xD;
      Dryvax® (per scarification). The study will last about 30 months. Each volunteer's&#xD;
      participation will last 6 months for all treatment groups. Subjects randomized to treatment&#xD;
      groups D and E will have follow-up for 2 years. During this time, volunteers will return&#xD;
      periodically for blood draws to check immune responses. Subjects will require visits for&#xD;
      dressing changes as needed post-Dryvax vaccination. Variables to be investigated include:&#xD;
      adverse events and side effects to the vaccines, and immunogenicity testing including&#xD;
      antibody and cellular responses to the vaccines.&#xD;
