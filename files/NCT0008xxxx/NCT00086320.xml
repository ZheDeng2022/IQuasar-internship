  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy (effectiveness) and safety of&#xD;
      paliperidone ER compared with placebo in the prevention of recurrence of symptoms of&#xD;
      schizophrenia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Paliperidone ER is currently being investigated as treatment for the acute symptoms of&#xD;
      schizophrenia and also as maintenance treatment. This trial is designed to evaluate efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of paliperidone ER in prevention of recurrence of psychotic symptoms in patients&#xD;
      with schizophrenia. This trial is a randomized (patients will be assigned to different&#xD;
      treatment groups based solely on chance), double-blind (neither the patient nor the physician&#xD;
      will know if placebo or drug is being given and at what dose), placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      parallel-group, multicenter study consisting of 5 phases: a screening phase of up to 5 days;&#xD;
      a 8-week open-label run-in phase, during which all patients will be treated with open-label,&#xD;
      flexibly dosed paliperidone ER (3 to 15 mg) orally once daily to identify a dose that will&#xD;
      achieve control of their acute psychotic symptoms (only patients who maintain a stable dosage&#xD;
      regimen and have a total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS] score &lt;/=70; Clinical&#xD;
      Global Impression Scale - Severity [CGI-S] &lt;/=4; and scores of &lt;/=4 for PANSS items for&#xD;
      delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, suspiciousness/persecution,&#xD;
      hostility, and uncooperativeness during the last 2 weeks of the run-in phase will be eligible&#xD;
      to continue in the stabilization phase); a 6-week open-label stabilization phase, patients&#xD;
      who maintain control of their acute psychotic symptoms at the paliperidone ER dosage&#xD;
      identified during the run-in phase and meet the total PANSS score, CGI-S, and PANSS items&#xD;
      scores throughout the stabilization phase will be randomized to receive either flexibly dosed&#xD;
      paliperidone ER, starting at the dose maintained during the stabilization phase of the study,&#xD;
      or placebo; a double-blind treatment phase of variable duration, during which patients will&#xD;
      be followed until they meet either defined criteria for recurrence or the study ends; a&#xD;
      52-week open-label extension phase for patients who experience a recurrence event during the&#xD;
      double-blind phase of the study, or who remain recurrence free for the entire double-blind&#xD;
      phase of the study. Efficacy will be assessed using the PANSS and CGI-S scores that will be&#xD;
      collected every week, every 2 weeks, or every 4 weeks throughout. Safety assessments include&#xD;
      the incidence of adverse events throughout the study; measurement of vital signs (orthostatic&#xD;
      pulse rate, orthostatic blood pressure, and temperature); and clinical laboratory tests. In&#xD;
      the run-in, double-blind, and open-label extension phases of the study, paliperidone ER or&#xD;
      matching placebo will be flexibly dosed in the range 3 to 15 mg orally once a day (3, 6, 9,&#xD;
      12, or 15 mg/day). The dosage in the stabilization phase will be fixed throughout at the&#xD;
      dosage that achieved symptom control in the run-in phase.&#xD;
