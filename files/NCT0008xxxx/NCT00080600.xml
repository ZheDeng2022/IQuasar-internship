  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      OBJECTIVE: Many persons who survive poliomyelitis develop pain, weakness, and fatigue many&#xD;
      decades later. It is not known why some persons develop this syndrome and others do not. One&#xD;
      possibility is that polio caused subclinical damage to the motor cortex. Autopsies in some&#xD;
      polio patients have found damage to the brainstem and motor cortex as well as to spinal motor&#xD;
      neurons. Alternatively, polio may have spared the motor cortex, but the cortex reorganized in&#xD;
      different ways to compensate for the loss of spinal motor neurons. This study will first&#xD;
      assess the integrity of central motor pathways in polio survivors with and without postpolio&#xD;
      syndrome. The second goal will be to investigate differences in the intracortical mechanisms&#xD;
      for controlling muscles affected and unaffected by polio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION: 60 patients who survived polio in childhood. Only patients with an&#xD;
      unequivocal history of polio will be referred to this study. Half of the patients will have&#xD;
      the post-polio syndrome. 30 normal volunteers, aged 21-75.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: Patients will be screened at the collaborating institution, the Uniformed Services&#xD;
      University of the Health Sciences, which will also perform sensory evoked potential testing&#xD;
      and MRI. At NIH, motor evoked potentials will be elicited from all four limbs using&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation to assess central motor conduction time and threshold.&#xD;
      Intracortical facilitation will be used to assess using paired-pulse magnetic stimulation.&#xD;
      Two muscles will be tested in each patient, one affected by polio and one unaffected by&#xD;
      polio. In the affected muscle, intracortical facilitation will be assessed again after&#xD;
      exercises it until it fatigues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME PARAMETERS: Cortical thresholds and central motor conduction times to all four limbs&#xD;
      will be measured in patients and compared to normal subjects. The mean intracortical&#xD;
      facilitation at rest will be compared in affected and unaffected muscles in polio patients&#xD;
      with and without post-polio syndrome.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        POLIO PATIENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Complete screening evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Meet clinical criteria for diagnosis of past polio (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Meet clinical criteria for the diagnosis of PPS (PPS group only) and have new muscle&#xD;
        weakness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age 21 or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        CLINICAL CRITERIA FOR PAST POLIO (CONFIRMED):&#xD;
&#xD;
        Clinically compatible signs and symptoms of paralytic poliomyelitis (acute flaccid&#xD;
        paralysis of one or more limbs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Decreased or absent tendon reflexes on the affected limbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No persistent sensory or cognitive loss.&#xD;

        No other apparent cause (including laboratory investigation to rule out other causes of&#xD;
        similar syndrome).&#xD;
