      This study will use a technique called blink reflex to study and compare how the brain&#xD;
      controls muscle movement in patients with craniofacial dystonia, their first-degree&#xD;
      relatives, and healthy, normal volunteers. People with dystonia have sustained muscle&#xD;
      contractions that cause twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures. In focal&#xD;
      dystonia, this happens in one area of the body, such as the hand, neck, or face.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three groups of people may be eligible for this study: 1) patients 18 years of age and older&#xD;
      with craniofacial dystonia; 2) first-degree relatives of patients with craniofacial dystonia;&#xD;
      and 3) normal volunteers matched in age to the patients. Candidates are screened with&#xD;
      physical and neurological examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo a blink reflex study. Patients with dystonia who are receiving botulinum&#xD;
      toxin injections must stop the medication 3 months before participating in the study and must&#xD;
      stop any other dystonia medications, such as benzodiazepines and anticholinergics, for 12&#xD;
      hours before the study. For the blink reflex procedure, subjects are seated in a comfortable&#xD;
      chair with their hands placed on a pillow on their lap. Metal electrodes are taped to the&#xD;
      forehead for delivering small electrical shocks that feel like very brief pinpricks. Subjects&#xD;
      receive 25 to 50 electrical stimuli, some as single shocks and some in pairs. The electrical&#xD;
      activity of muscles that respond to the stimuli is recorded with a computer. The study takes&#xD;
      from about 1 to 2 hours.&#xD;

      The objective of this study is to evaluate paired-pulse inhibition of the three responses of&#xD;
      the electrically elicited blink reflex (BR) and the eye blink rate (EBR)in patients with&#xD;
      craniofacial dystonia and their first degree relatives in order to determine whether&#xD;
      abnormalities of inhibition can represent a marker of genetic predisposition for the&#xD;
      development of dystonia. It is unclear why some relatives of patients with craniofacial&#xD;
      dystonia do not develop dystonic symptoms. One possible explanation is that the development&#xD;
      of dystonia is a two-stage process: first, loss of inhibition, which may be genetically&#xD;
      determined, and second, exposure to an environmental trigger such as excessive repetitive&#xD;
      movements. There is good evidence that focal dystonia is a genetically determined disorder,&#xD;
      but the responsible gene remains undetermined. Patients, their first degree relatives and&#xD;
      normal volunteers will undergo BR testing using validated electrophysiological tests of&#xD;
      recovery cycle. The main outcome measure of the study is impaired inhibition in up to 50% of&#xD;
      first degree relatives of patients with focal dystonia which would serve as biologic marker&#xD;
      for the carrier state. A second outcome measure is the EBR. In those individuals with this&#xD;
      genetic marker of impaired inhibition, future linkage analysis studies could be performed to&#xD;
      identify the causative gene.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Three groups of subjects shall be studied: 1) patients with craniofacial dystonia, 2) first&#xD;
        degree relatives of patients with craniofacial dystonia, 3) age matched control group. The&#xD;
        inclusion of the group of relatives will be valuable to study, as these individuals have&#xD;
        shared similar environment backgrounds as patients but remain free of symptoms. Patients&#xD;
        and their relatives 18 years or older will be enrolled through the Human Motor Control&#xD;
        Clinic, NINDS, NIH under protocol 93-N-0202: &quot;Diagnosis and Natural History Protocol for&#xD;
        Patients with Different Neurological Conditions&quot;. Patients with dystonia, enrolled in&#xD;
        Protocol 85-N-0195, &quot;Efficacy and Pathophysiology of Botulinum Toxin for Treatment of&#xD;
        Involuntary Movement Disorders' will also be eligible for participation in the study.&#xD;
        Diagnosis of dystonia will rely on review of medical record, history, and clinical&#xD;
        evaluation. Age matched volunteers over 18 years-old entered into the study must be free of&#xD;
        neurological disease as determined by a standard physical and neurological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR VIDEOTAPING:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with idiopathic BSP or Meige-Syndrome (=BSP plus oromandibular dystonia), their&#xD;
        first degree relatives and age matched volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
        Eye blink rate at rest more than 27 per minute (patients only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients, their first degree relatives and normal volunteers with any significant medical&#xD;
        or psychiatric illness, pregnancy, history of epilepsy, concurrent use of tricyclic&#xD;
        antidepressants, neuroleptic agents, or any other licit or illicit drug that could affect&#xD;
        brainstem excitability will not be eligible for this study. Subjects who have a pacemaker,&#xD;
        an implanted medication pump, metal objects inside the eye or skull (for example, after&#xD;
        brain surgery or a shrapnel would) or any recent (less than 3 months) brain lesions will&#xD;
        not be included in this study. Patients who have received botulinum toxin injection less&#xD;
        than three months prior to the day of testing will also be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR VIDEOTAPING:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Other disease with involuntary blinking (Hemifacial spasm, Tic disorder, Tardive&#xD;
        Dyskinesia, Blepharitis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Taking the following medications: antidepressants, anxiolytics, anticonvulsants,&#xD;
        antipsychotics, antiparkinson, hypnotics, stimulants, and/or antihistamines&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subject's objection to being videotaped while performing different activities&#xD;
&#xD;
        First degree relatives and age matched volunteers who are diagnosed with a neurological or&#xD;
        psychiatric disease or medication that alter the blink frequency.&#xD;
