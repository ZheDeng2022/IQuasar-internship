      This study will examine how depression may influence the way the brain regulates heart&#xD;
      function. Some researchers believe that depression may be a risk factor for some forms of&#xD;
      heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Right-handed healthy volunteers and patients with major depressive disorder who are between&#xD;
      18 and 50 years of age may be eligible for this study. Female candidates must be&#xD;
      premenopausal. Patients must currently be experiencing a major depressive episode. All&#xD;
      candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination, electrocardiogram,&#xD;
      and blood and urine tests. They are interviewed about their psychiatric and medical history,&#xD;
      current emotional state and sleep pattern, and family history of psychiatric disorders. They&#xD;
      complete symptoms ratings scales for depression, anxiety, and negative thinking; history of&#xD;
      alcohol and tobacco use; level of physical activity; socioeconomic status; overall level of&#xD;
      functioning; and, for depressed patients, their depression type. Women candidates have their&#xD;
      menstrual phase determined by the timing of their recent menstrual cycles and may undergo&#xD;
      testing to determine the time of their ovulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12-minute walk/run test - This test measures the subject's general level of&#xD;
           cardiorespiratory fitness. In a gymnasium in the NIH Clinical Center, the subject walks&#xD;
           or runs as far as he or she can in 12 minutes. Blood pressure is measured before and&#xD;
           after the exercise test, and heart rate is measured during exercise with a monitor worn&#xD;
           around the chest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) - A brain MRI scan is done to obtain pictures of the&#xD;
           brain anatomy. Electrocardiogram leads are placed on the subject's chest to measure the&#xD;
           electrical activity of the heart during the scanning session. The subject lies on a&#xD;
           narrow bed in the scanner, which is a narrow metal cylinder about 6 feet long. The&#xD;
           scanning session takes up to 90 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Positron emission tomography (PET) - PET scanning produces images of the brain's blood&#xD;
           flow. The subject is injected with a radiotracer (small amount of drug labeled with a&#xD;
           radioactive substance) that is detected by a special camera to trace blood flow. During&#xD;
           the scanning session, the subject lies still on a table. EKG leas are placed on the&#xD;
           subject's chest to measure the electrical activity of the heart during the scan. A mask&#xD;
           with holes for the eyes, ears, and mouth is placed over the subject's face to keep the&#xD;
           head f...&#xD;

      The presence of major depression, with or without pre-existing coronary artery disease,&#xD;
      predicts increased mortality from myocardial infarction (MI) and sudden cardiac death (SCD).&#xD;
      Decreased parasympathetic vagal outflow, especially in the presence of elevated cardiac&#xD;
      sympathetic tone, has been proposed as a mechanism for the increased risk of SCD. Multiple&#xD;
      lines of evidence suggests that fronto-limbic areas are actively engaged in the robust&#xD;
      optimization of autonomic balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic cardiac outflow&#xD;
      over a broad range of cognitive and physical demands. We propose that dysfunction of these&#xD;
      forebrain neurocardiac networks in MDD mediates maladaptive cardiac autonomic control and the&#xD;
      increased risk of cardiovascular mortality. In this model, neurocardiac control networks&#xD;
      exhibit a systemic bias toward increased sympathetic relative to parasympathetic outflow.&#xD;
      Increased amygdalar activity in MDD will promote this imbalance. Additionally, dysfunction in&#xD;
      posterior orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and ventral anterior cingulated cortex (ACC), areas&#xD;
      associated with abnormal histopathological changes in MDD, will lead to reduced capacity for&#xD;
      generating adaptive levels of cardioinhibitory, parasympathetic tone. This reduced capacity&#xD;
      in depressives will be evidenced by abnormally large withdrawals of parasympathetic outflow,&#xD;
      compared to healthy controls, as cognitive or physical demands increase. This dynamic model&#xD;
      is potentially consistent with functional neuroimaging and post mortem histopathological&#xD;
      findings in MDD and the knowledge gained through testing this protocol may ultimately&#xD;
      elucidate how brain dysfunction in MDD mediates significantly increased clinical risk of&#xD;
      spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to combine H (2) (15) O positron emission tomography (PET) and analysis of heart&#xD;
      rate variability (HRV) in order to study in vivo the neural structures underlying normal&#xD;
      forebrain control of cardiac autonomic function. We further aim to show whether regional&#xD;
      functional abnormalities in amygdala, ventral anterior cingulate cortex, and orbitofrontal&#xD;
      cortex-areas in which functional abnormalities have been identified in previous neuroimaging&#xD;
      studies of major depressives-are associated with impaired modulation of cardiac autonomic&#xD;
      function during major depression.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Two groups of right-handed subjects, male or premenopausal female, who are drug-naive or&#xD;
        who have not received psychotropic drugs for at least 3 weeks (8 weeks for fluoxetine),&#xD;
        will be recruited for studies under this protocol: unipolar depressives and healthy&#xD;
        controls individually matched to depressives by age, gender and smoking status. Because&#xD;
        effective treatment will not be discontinued for the purposes of this protocol, subjects in&#xD;
        the patient groups will be identified who have never been treated for or who have&#xD;
        discontinued medication due to lack of efficacy, noncompliance, physician order or other&#xD;
        reason prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The presence of inclusion and exclusion criteria will be established using both an&#xD;
        unstructured clinical interview with a psychiatrist and the Structure Clinical Interview&#xD;
        for DSM-IV (SCID). Family history of mental illness will be obtained using the Family&#xD;
        Interview of Genetic Studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be excluded if they have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        serious suicidal ideation or behavior;&#xD;
&#xD;
        inability to provide informed consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
        medical or neurological illnesses likely to affect physiology or anatomy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        a history of drug or alcohol abuse within 1 year or a lifetime history of alcohol or drug&#xD;
        dependence (DSM-IV criteria);&#xD;
&#xD;
        current or past history of other axis I disorders that preceded the onset of MDD;&#xD;
&#xD;
        current pregnancy (documented by pregnancy testing prior to scanning);&#xD;
&#xD;
        current breast feeding;&#xD;
&#xD;
        general MRI exclusion criteria;&#xD;
&#xD;
        vision and/or hearing problems severe enough to interfere with testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exposure within two weeks to medications likely to affect cerebral blood glow or heart&#xD;
        rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any condition that may prevent the subject from performing the run/walk test, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        Irregular menstrual cycles so that menstrual phase cannot be reliably determined, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any ECG finding that would contraindicate PET scanning or run/walk testing (e.g. non-sinus&#xD;
        rhythm, significant tachycardia, ST segment elevation or depression, Q waves) or arrhythmia&#xD;
        that would obviate accurate calculation of HRV indices. Cardiology consultation will be&#xD;
        obtained for abnormal ECG findings unless it is unequivocally clear in the judgment of the&#xD;
        study physician that such consultation is medically unnecessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who are beyond age 50 who are either postmenopausal or perimenopausal are excluded&#xD;
        to reduce the biological heterogeneity in autonomic function which may be associated with&#xD;
        difference in menstrual status.&#xD;
