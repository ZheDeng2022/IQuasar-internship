  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People recently infected with HIV who are treated with anti-HIV medications may develop&#xD;
      strong immune system responses to HIV and may be able to control the virus without continuing&#xD;
      to take these medications. The purpose of this study is to see if giving anti-HIV medications&#xD;
      to people soon after they have been infected with HIV can help them control HIV. The study&#xD;
      will also see if the immune system can control the amount of HIV virus in the blood (viral&#xD;
      load) even after a person has stopped taking the medications. The study will evaluate three&#xD;
      different schedules of stopping and starting anti-HIV medications to see which schedule is&#xD;
      best able to boost a patient's immune system to control HIV viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Combination therapy started in primary HIV infection, in conjunction with&#xD;
      structured treatment interruptions, will result in greater control of viremia off treatment&#xD;
      than induction therapy alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Initiation of treatment during acute HIV infection seems to result in greater suppression of&#xD;
      viral replication than noted during chronic infection and better recovery of certain CD4&#xD;
      subpopulations. However, it is difficult for patients treated during acute infection to&#xD;
      maintain long-term continuous antiretroviral (ARV) treatment because of difficulty adhering&#xD;
      to complicated medication regimens, drug-related toxicities, and cost of medications. Acutely&#xD;
      infected patients who have undergone early initiation of treatment followed by structured&#xD;
      treatment interruptions (STIs) appear to have lower off-treatment viral loads than historical&#xD;
      controls. This study will evaluate whether effective ARV treatment during acute and early HIV&#xD;
      infection followed by STI will result in lower viral setpoints than would otherwise be&#xD;
      expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will have 2 steps and will last for a maximum of 104 weeks. Participants will&#xD;
      either enter Step 1 and continue on to Step 2 or enter Step 2 directly. During Step 1,&#xD;
      participants with acute or early HIV infection will be given 24 weeks of ARV therapy.&#xD;
      Participants may take any combination of FDA-approved ARV medications that they and their&#xD;
      doctors select. Participants will have study visits at study entry and Weeks 1, 4, 8, and 20.&#xD;
      After 24 weeks on Step 1, participants may enroll in Step 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Step 1 and people with early or acute HIV infection who began ARV treatment&#xD;
      within 21 days of diagnosis and have had no more than 1 year of treatment may enroll in Step&#xD;
      2. During Step 2, participants will be randomly assigned to one of two study arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 1: Participants will continue taking ARV therapy for 16 weeks and then stop ARVs for&#xD;
           64 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 2: Participants will stop ARVs for 4 weeks, take ARVs for 8 weeks, stop ARVs for 4&#xD;
           weeks, take ARVs for 8 weeks, and then stop ARVs for 56 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in both study arms will restart ARVs regardless of STI duration if their viral&#xD;
      load is above 50,000 copies/ml, they progress to CDC category C disease, or their CD4 count&#xD;
      falls below 350 cells/mm3 or declines more than 50% from the last on-treatment CD4 level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2 will last 80 weeks. For the first year, participants will have study visits every 1 to&#xD;
      4 weeks, depending on whether they are taking ARVs. During the second year, participants will&#xD;
      have study visits every 8 weeks. Study visits will include a brief medical history, blood and&#xD;
      pregnancy tests, and voluntary behavioral questionnaires.&#xD;
