      RATIONALE: New diagnostic procedures such as computed tomographic colonography may improve&#xD;
      the ability to detect colorectal cancer and may provide a less invasive method of detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well computed tomographic colonography works in&#xD;
      screening healthy participants for colorectal cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the sensitivity of computed tomographic colonography (CTC) vs colonoscopy for&#xD;
           detecting significantly large lesions (≥ 10 mm in diameter) in asymptomatic&#xD;
           participants, in terms of specificity, area under the ROC curve, and predictive values&#xD;
           for detecting clinically significant colorectal neoplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the interobserver variation in accuracy of interpreting CTC examinations of&#xD;
           these participants, including any benefits of a primary 3-dimensional read and/or&#xD;
           independent second interpretations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the effects of different colon preparations on the accuracy of CTC in these&#xD;
           participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare participant acceptance and willingness to have a repeat examination by CTC vs&#xD;
           colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the accuracy of CTC in detecting flat lesions in the colon of these&#xD;
           participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive an oral laxative, oral bisacodyl, and three doses of oral barium&#xD;
      sulphate 24 hours before imaging. After cathartic cleansing, participants undergo computed&#xD;
      tomographic colonography followed by colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are followed up for approximately 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,607 participants will be accrued for this study.&#xD;

      <recruitment_details>2600 asymptomatic, out-patients, 50 years or older and prescheduled for screening colonoscopy were recruited for CTC between February 2005 and December 2006.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of the 2607 registration events, 7 were registration errors [duplicate registrations due to system errors] and were cancelled. Therefore, a total of 2600 unique participants were enrolled to the study.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Evaluate interobserver variability in Sensitivity (P(T+|D+)) and 95% CI) when interpreting CTC examinations Each study was randomly assigned to be read independently using either a primary 2D search method (conventional 2D image display with 3D endoluminal problem solving), or a primary 3D search method (including the capability of displaying multiplanar 2D) and without prior knowledge of the colonoscopy results. A second trained radiologist of similar skill was assigned to read the images using the other modality Readers were then classified as high performing or not high performing</description>

        <population>15 readers read the 2531 case and their sensitivity was calculated as well as the variability (95% CI) in Sensitivity within 2 reader groups: High performing (HP) and not high performing (NHP). HP readers had both a sensitivity and specificity of &gt; 85% for detecting polyps 10 mm and larger, NHP did not.</population>
