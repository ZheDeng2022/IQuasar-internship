  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether bradykinin receptors are produced at the site of wisdom tooth&#xD;
      extraction and if they contribute to the amount of inflammation and pain that follows&#xD;
      surgery. Bradykinin is a molecule produced by enzymes at the site of an injury and then binds&#xD;
      to receptors to cause pain. The study will also evaluate the role of genetic factors in the&#xD;
      production of bradykinin and their receptors and the pain associated with minor surgical&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients between 16 and 35 years of age who are referred to the NIH dental clinic for removal&#xD;
      of two wisdom teeth may be eligible for this study. Candidates must be in good health and&#xD;
      must not be allergic to aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, sulfites, or amide&#xD;
      anesthetics. They will be screened with a medical history and oral examination, including&#xD;
      x-rays to confirm the need for wisdom tooth extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the morning of surgery following an overnight fast, participants have a blood sample drawn&#xD;
      to extract DNA for gene studies. Just before surgery, they are given an intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      sedative to induce drowsiness and a local anesthetic to numb the mouth. They are also given&#xD;
      IV either Ketorolac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or placebo, a look-alike&#xD;
      medication with no active ingredient. After the extractions, a small piece of plastic tubing&#xD;
      is placed in both extraction sites, and every 20 minutes for the next 3 hours inflammatory&#xD;
      fluid is collected from the tubing for measuring chemicals believed to cause pain and&#xD;
      swelling. Patients rate their pain by answering pain-related questions every 20 minutes.&#xD;
      Patients who have pain that is not relieved by the study medication (Ketorolac or placebo)&#xD;
      are given, upon request, 50 mg of the pain reliever tramadol (Ultram). Patients remain in the&#xD;
      clinic for at least 3 hours and no more than 7 hours after surgery in order for monitoring&#xD;
      the effects of the study drugs as the local anesthetic wears off.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo two biopsies during the study - one before and one after the extraction - to&#xD;
      measure any changes in chemicals produced in response to the surgery. The second biopsy is&#xD;
      done either 3, 7, or 24 hours after the extraction. Patients in the 3- and 7-hour groups are&#xD;
      given a small dose of local anesthetic in the gum for the second biopsy and remain in the&#xD;
      clinic until the biopsy is done; those in the 24-hour group are given forms to record pain&#xD;
      ratings at home and return to the clinic the following morning for a 2-hour follow-up visit.&#xD;
      All patients are given standard pain medication (flurbiprofen) to take at home.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bradykinin B1 receptors and their natural agonists are known to be rapidly induced in local&#xD;
      tissues by a variety of inflammatory stimuli. Preclinical evidence, demonstrating that&#xD;
      interruption of B1 receptor function causes analgesia under a variety of conditions, has been&#xD;
      well established using selective antagonists and genetically modified mice. Accordingly,&#xD;
      efforts are underway in several laboratories to develop novel B1 receptor antagonists as&#xD;
      potential novel analgesic agents. The proposed studies will examine the kinetics of local&#xD;
      induction of B1 receptors and kinin formation in a common situation of acute inflammatory&#xD;
      pain in humans - tooth extraction. In addition, an examination of expression of additional&#xD;
      genes of interest under these conditions using microarray analysis will be conducted.&#xD;
