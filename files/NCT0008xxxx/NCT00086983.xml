    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of rebeccamycin analog and&#xD;
      oxaliplatin in treating patients with refractory solid tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy,&#xD;
      such as rebeccamycin analog and oxaliplatin, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from&#xD;
      dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of XL119 given in conjunction with oxaliplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.To determine the dose limiting toxicities of this combination. III. To determine the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of these 2 agents when given in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive rebeccamycin analogue IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 and oxaliplatin IV over 2&#xD;
      hours on day 5. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of rebeccamycin analogue and oxaliplatin&#xD;
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose&#xD;
      preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least&#xD;
      6 patients are treated at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed annually for survival.&#xD;
