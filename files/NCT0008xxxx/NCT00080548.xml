  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine and compare how the brain controls the timing of movement in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers and in people with schizophrenia. Previous experiments have shown that when people&#xD;
      are asked to look at a clock and report the time they first decide to make a movement, they&#xD;
      report times later than the first brain waves associated with movement appear. When they are&#xD;
      asked to report the time they first initiate the movement, they report times before the&#xD;
      muscles actually begin to move. The study may help determine how the sense of willing and&#xD;
      initiating an action is altered in schizophrenic patients, and how people may feel more or&#xD;
      less &quot;in control&quot; of their movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal volunteers and patients with schizophrenia between 18 and 65 years of age may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Control subjects must not have any neurological or psychological&#xD;
      disorders, and schizophrenia patients must not have any other neurological disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have a medical history, physical examination, and a test to determine&#xD;
      their level of attention. Schizophrenia patients will be interviewed about their symptoms and&#xD;
      complete psychiatric rating scales. In addition, all participants will undergo the following&#xD;
      procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electric shock&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants look at a clock on a computer screen whose hands revolves around the clock fast.&#xD;
      While they look at the clock, they are given small, non-painful electric shocks and are asked&#xD;
      to say when they receive the shocks, according to the clock. The shocks are repeated 40&#xD;
      times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm movement&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are asked to lift their arm up off a table repeatedly, at random times, while&#xD;
      they look at the computer clock. This exercise is repeated a total of 80 times. Of these 80&#xD;
      times, participants are asked 10 times in a row to say the time they first had the desire to&#xD;
      move their arm, and then 10 times in a row the time they first felt that they were moving&#xD;
      their arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electroencephalography (EEG) and Electromyography (EMG)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo EEG and EMG during the electric shock and arm movement experiments to&#xD;
      measure electrical activity of the brain (EEG) and of the muscles (EMG). For EEG, electrodes&#xD;
      (small metal discs) are placed on the scalp with a cap, paste, or glue-like substance and the&#xD;
      brain waves are recorded. For EMG, electrodes are taped to the skin over the muscle.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine how the subjective sense of willing and initiating&#xD;
      an action is altered in schizophrenic patients. One proposed explanation for characteristic&#xD;
      symptoms of schizophrenia (&quot;passivity phenomena&quot;) is a defect in the forward model of&#xD;
      movement that the brain receives as the motor signal is generated. We propose to examine this&#xD;
      forward model using Libet's paradigm, in which normal subjects gave evidence for a forward&#xD;
      model in their anticipatory reports of initiation of movement. We intend to determine the&#xD;
      times associated with willing (W), initiating (M), and&#xD;
      electroencephalographic/electromyographic (EEG/EMG) measures of movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to study adult patients with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental&#xD;
      Disorders diagnosis of schizophrenia. These patients provide a unique population for this&#xD;
      study because they often do not have the sense that they direct their own movement or author&#xD;
      their own thoughts (passivity phenomena). Studies have shown that schizophrenics have&#xD;
      movement-related cortical potentials on EEG, but it is not known when the subjective sense of&#xD;
      initiating movement occurs for these patients. As the order of mental events in time has been&#xD;
      shown to contribute to the sense of agency, it is important to know how the timing of&#xD;
      voluntary movement is altered in schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will ask patients to look at a fast-rotating clock on a computer screen and note when&#xD;
      their movements were willed, instigated by an external agent if they have such delusions, and&#xD;
      were initiated. Patients will also report the time of a somatosensory stimulus. Surface EMG&#xD;
      will determine the time of actual movement, and EEG will record brain potentials associated&#xD;
      with movement. Eligible patients with schizophrenia and passivity phenomena will be recruited&#xD;
      from the Clinical Brain Disorders Branch, NIMH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure of this study is the absence of time W in some schizophrenics,&#xD;
      the latency of W in other schizophrenics compared to normal subjects, and the latency of M in&#xD;
      schizophrenics compared to normals. Any effect of medication status or symptoms on&#xD;
      performance in the study will be considered exploratory data.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        SCHIZOPHRENIC PATIENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Experimental subjects will be patients with DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia who have&#xD;
        volunteered to participate in the clinical research unit of the Clinical Brain Disorders&#xD;
        Branch, NIMH. In addition, outpatients with DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia who&#xD;
        participate in outpatient research through the CBDB will be included. All patients will&#xD;
        have received the diagnosis of schizophrenia by means of the Structured Clinical Interview&#xD;
        for DSM-IV (SCID) with three psychiatrists reaching a consensus diagnosis. Patients on the&#xD;
        clinical research unit must meet rigorous criteria in order to participate in research.&#xD;
        Exclusionary criteria include history of traumatic brain injury, known comorbid&#xD;
        neurological disorders, including epilepsy, history of drug and alcohol abuse, etc. All&#xD;
        patients will have undergone a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests, including&#xD;
        Wide Range Achievement Test- Reading (often to be a good indicator of premorbid&#xD;
        intelligence), a short version of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-R), Wechsler&#xD;
        Memory Scales (WMS-R), Trails A and B, tests of attention and executive function, including&#xD;
        the continuous performance test (CPT), Wisconsin Card Sort (WISC), the N-Back test of&#xD;
        working memory. Patients with psychiatric diseases other than schizophrenia that are not&#xD;
        currently active and symptomatic will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients in the study will have schizophrenia. However, at the time of testing,&#xD;
        patients will be administered clinical rating scales (i.e., Brief Psychotic Rating Scale&#xD;
        (BPRS), appropriate sections of the SCID and the Yale Hallucination Phenomenology&#xD;
        Assessment (YHPA)) to determine the presence of passivity phenomena.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NORMAL VOLUNTEERS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Twenty-six normal controls will be included; controls will be screened in the NINDS&#xD;
        Movement Disorders Outpatient Clinic, and will have neurological and physical examinations.&#xD;
        They will be asked to abstain from alcohol for 24 hours before the study. All subjects&#xD;
        participating in the studies will have a valid Clinical Center Medical Record Number.&#xD;
&#xD;
        ALL SUBJECTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All subjects will be between the ages of 18 and 65. Subjects may be male or female.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients younger than 18 years old or older than 65 years old will be excluded from the&#xD;
        study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A. Patients with neurological disorders will be excluded. Patients with psychiatric&#xD;
        disorders other than schizophrenia who are experiencing an active phase of their disorder&#xD;
        will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        B. Patients with a history of significant medical disorders requiring chronic treatment&#xD;
        with other drugs, which affect the central nervous system and cannot be stopped will be&#xD;
        excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        C. Patients not capable of giving an informed consent will be excluded.&#xD;
