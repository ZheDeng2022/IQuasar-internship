  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of Amonafide in men with&#xD;
      androgen-independent prostate cancer, assigned to individualized doses of Amonafide based on&#xD;
      acetylator phenotype information (doses adjusted on individual metabolism).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase I/II, multicenter study of Amonafide in subjects with&#xD;
      androgen-independent metastatic prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amonafide is metabolized by N-acetylation to an active metabolite, N-acetyl-Amonafide.&#xD;
      Inter-subject differences in N-acetylation can explain the variability in Amonafide-induced&#xD;
      myelosuppression. This dose-defining protocol has been designed to assess safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of Amonafide in men with androgen-independent prostate cancer, assigned to individualized&#xD;
      doses based on acetylator phenotype information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of this study will be approximately 12 - 16 months: approximately 6 - 10&#xD;
      months for enrollment, and approximately 6 months for subject screening, treatment, and&#xD;
      follow up per protocol. Subjects will be treated until PSA progression, disease progression,&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects may continue participation in the study after Cycle 5 at the investigator's&#xD;
      discretion if PSA progression, disease progression, or unacceptable toxicities are not&#xD;
      reported. If a subject fulfills a criterion of PSA progression or disease progression, yet in&#xD;
      the opinion of the investigator, the subject appears to be deriving clinical benefit from the&#xD;
      study medication, a request may be made to the Xanthus medical monitor to allow that subject&#xD;
      to continue study participation on a compassionate basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow-up evaluation for all subjects will be done 30 - 35 days after receiving the last&#xD;
      dose of Amonafide. Subjects will be contacted every 3 months for survival after completion of&#xD;
      the active phase of the study, until death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PSA response will be reported for all subjects receiving Amonafide treatment. PSA levels will&#xD;
      be measured at Screening and once per treatment cycle thereafter (at Day 1 of each cycle). A&#xD;
      PSA responder will be defined as a subject experiencing a 50% decrease in PSA level,&#xD;
      confirmed four or more weeks later, with no demonstration of clinical or radiographic&#xD;
      evidence of disease progression prior to the second PSA measurement. Duration PSA response&#xD;
      and time to PSA progression will also be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to PSA endpoints, traditional response criteria such as overall tumor response&#xD;
      rate (complete + partial tumor response), duration of tumor response, and time to tumor&#xD;
      progression will be captured for all subjects with measurable lesions. All complete and&#xD;
      partial responses must be confirmed by repeat assessments that should be performed no less&#xD;
      than 4 weeks after the criteria for response are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, in order to evaluate safety, all subjects will be assessed for signs of adverse&#xD;
      events according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3&#xD;
      dated June 10, 2003.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All serious adverse events (SAEs) and grade Â¾ toxicities will be reviewed by the Sponsor's&#xD;
      medical monitor. Appropriate action may be taken to terminate or put the study on hold if&#xD;
      warranted by unanticipated toxicity.&#xD;
