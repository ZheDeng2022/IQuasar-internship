  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 12-day study will test whether the combination of G-CSF (granulocyte-colony stimulating&#xD;
      factor) and AMD3100 (Mozobil) is more efficient in mobilizing stem cells for collection than&#xD;
      the use of G-CSF alone. Traditionally, the growth factor G-CSF has been given to stem cell&#xD;
      donors to mobilize, or push, stem cells out of the bone marrow and into the blood circulation&#xD;
      for collection for transplantation. Although a sufficient quantity of cells usually can be&#xD;
      collected with G-CSF treatment, some donors do not respond well and may require multiple&#xD;
      apheresis procedures (see below) to collect enough cells. Studies indicate that G-CSF used&#xD;
      together with a drug called AMD3100 may be more effective in mobilizing stem cells for&#xD;
      collection than G-CSF alone. The Food and Drug Administration has approved G-CSF for stem&#xD;
      cell mobilization. AMD3100 is a new drug that also mobilizes stem cells in large numbers&#xD;
      within a few hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal healthy volunteers between 18 and 60 years of age may be eligible for this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) are the most popular source of hematopoetic stem&#xD;
      cells for allogeneic transplantation because of technical ease of collection and faster&#xD;
      engraftment. Traditionally, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) has been used to&#xD;
      procure the peripheral blood stem cell graft. Although regimens using G-CSF usually succeed&#xD;
      in collecting adequate numbers of PBPC from healthy donors, 5%-10% of the donors will&#xD;
      mobilize stem cells poorly and may require multiple large volume apheresis or bone marrow&#xD;
      harvesting. AMD3100 reversibly inhibits CXC- chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) binding to stromal&#xD;
      cell derived factor (SDF) - 1 and was recently discovered to be an effective agent to&#xD;
      mobilize cluster of differentiation 34 (CD34)+ cells into the peripheral blood. In normal&#xD;
      volunteers, administering AMD3100 after 4-5 days of G-CSF resulted in a 3-3.5 fold increase&#xD;
      in circulating CD34 cells compared to G-CSF alone. Recent data has suggested that the&#xD;
      combination of G-CSF and AMD3100 is superior to G-CSF alone for mobilizing hematopoietic&#xD;
      progenitor cells in heavily pretreated patients with multiple myeloma or non-Hodgkin's&#xD;
      lymphoma undergoing autologous hematopoietic transplantation. Combining AMD3100 with G-CSF&#xD;
      could be an effective strategy to improve the yield of PBPC collected from allogeneic donors&#xD;
      who mobilize poorly with G-CSF alone. However, the biological impact of AMD3100 in this&#xD;
      context on T cells and other cellular populations contained within the allograft that mediate&#xD;
      graft versus host disease (GVHD) and graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to collect peripheral progenitor cell (PBPC) from healthy volunteers following 5&#xD;
      days of G-CSF (10 mcg/kg/day) and a single dose of AMD3100 (240 mcg/kg subcutaneous given 12&#xD;
      hours before starting apheresis) to study the impact of combining these two mobilizing agents&#xD;
      on the immunological properties of the mobilized cells. A single 15 liter apheresis will be&#xD;
      conducted on day 5 following the 5th dose of G-CSF. The immunological studies conducted on&#xD;
      these mobilized cells will be the same as our parallel study which is investigating the&#xD;
      immune properties of PBPCs mobilized with G-CSF or AMD3100 alone. If combining AMD3100 with&#xD;
      G-CSF has no negative impact on the immune populations involved in GVHD and graft-vs-leukemia&#xD;
      effects, this regimen could be used for allogeneic donors who fail to mobilize sufficient&#xD;
      peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) using G-CSF alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To determine the cytokine polarization status of cluster of&#xD;
      differentiation 4 (CD4+) T-cells collected by apheresis following combination of AMD3100 and&#xD;
      G-CSF compared to G-CSF mobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: the ratio of Th1 [intracellular interferon (IFN-g) +] versus Th2&#xD;
      [intracellular interleukin (IL-4+)] T-cells in the apheresis products collected from&#xD;
      individual donors undergoing mobilization with combination of G-CSF and AMD3100 to the ratio&#xD;
      in apheresis product collected with G-CSF alone (ratio published in literature).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints: To examine 1) the cellular content and other immune properties of&#xD;
      mobilized cells; 2) yields of hematopoietic progenitor cells, immune cells, and other&#xD;
      cellular subsets collected by apheresis; and the 3) safety profile of AMD3100.&#xD;

    <description>Healthy volunteers will be administered AMD 3100 (Mozobil plerixafor) and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) to determine cytokine polarization status of cluster of differentiation (CD 4) T-cells collected by apheresis.&#xD;
We propose that the combination of single dose AMD 3100 and G-CSF as combined mobilizing agents will improve the peripheral blood progenitor cells mobilization. Successful treatment responders is defined by completing study treatment with cell mobilization and cell collection. Non-responders is defined by having completed the study treatment and having cell mobilization without cell collection.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Successful Apheresis Collection Following Combination of AMD3100 and G-CSF.</title>
        <description>Healthy volunteers will be administered AMD 3100 (Mozobil plerixafor) and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) to determine cytokine polarization status of cluster of differentiation (CD 4) T-cells collected by apheresis.&#xD;
We propose that the combination of single dose AMD 3100 and G-CSF as combined mobilizing agents will improve the peripheral blood progenitor cells mobilization. Successful treatment responders is defined by completing study treatment with cell mobilization and cell collection. Non-responders is defined by having completed the study treatment and having cell mobilization without cell collection.</description>
