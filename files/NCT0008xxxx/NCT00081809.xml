      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document the efficacy of treatment with autologous lymphoma-derived HSPPC-96 of&#xD;
           selected patients with indolent lymphoma. The efficacy endpoints are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the rate of complete and partial responses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the time to progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of autologous tumor-derived heat-shock protein&#xD;
           peptide complex (HSPPC-96) administered intradermally once weekly for four consecutive&#xD;
           weeks, followed by HSPPC-96 administered once every two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the feasibility of autologous HSPPC-96 preparation from lymphoma specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess approximately the composition of the tissue source of the autologous HSPPC-96&#xD;
           for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the effect of autologous lymphoma-derived HSPPC-96 vaccine therapy on the&#xD;
           expression of Fas ligand and TRAIL death proteins in peripheral blood lymphocytes of&#xD;
           patients with indolent lymphoma.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with previously treated or newly diagnosed follicular center cell grade I or&#xD;
             grade II lymphoma, small lymphocytic lymphoma, MALT lymphoma, monocytoid B-cell&#xD;
             lymphoma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, or marginal zone lymphoma with&#xD;
             bidimensionally measurable disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Part of the resected specimen must undergo routine pathologic examination to confirm&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Autologous HSPPC-96 vaccine must be successfully prepared and provided by the sponsor;&#xD;

             preparation;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bidimensionally measurable disease in at least one location other than the resected&#xD;
             lymphoid tissue;&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Zubrod performance status of less then or equal to 2;&#xD;

             the opinion of the Principal Investigator;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to&#xD;
             entry into the study and must not be lactating;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be willing to be followed at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center during the&#xD;
             course of treatment and follow-up;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Electrocardiogram if none performed in the prior six months;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have no chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or experimental&#xD;
             anti-cancer therapy within six weeks prior to starting autologous HSPPC-96&#xD;
             administration;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have fully recovered from prior anti-cancer therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
