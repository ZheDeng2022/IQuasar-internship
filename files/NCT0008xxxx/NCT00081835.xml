  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate patients with eye complications related to vaccination against&#xD;
      smallpox to learn more about these conditions. Vaccinia vaccination has been used for more&#xD;
      than 100 years for preventing smallpox. A small number of people who receive the vaccination&#xD;
      (less than 1 in 1,000) develop complications, sometimes in their eyes. This usually results&#xD;
      from the accidental transfer of the infection from the vaccination site to the face or eyes,&#xD;
      perhaps by touching the vaccination area and then the face or eyelids before washing the&#xD;
      hands. The study will also examine whether an experimental treatment called NP-016 vaccinia&#xD;
      immune globulin can reduce corneal scarring that is sometimes associated with serious&#xD;
      vaccinia complications and can impair vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children and adults with keratitis, severe conjunctivitis, or blepharitis following exposure&#xD;
      to vaccinia vaccination may be eligible for this study. Children must weigh at least 10 kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures at enrollment, with some tests&#xD;
      repeated at scheduled study visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Medical history and physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Infectious disease consultation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Complete eye evaluation including:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fundus photography to examine the back of the eye - dilation of the pupils with eye&#xD;
                drops to examine and photograph the back of the eye&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Slit lamp biomicroscopy - evaluation of the front part of the eye with a slit lamp&#xD;
                microscope&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Eye pressure measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Eye swab to look for vaccinia virus or other causes of disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Photographs and documentation of eye and skin lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Vaccinia diagnostic tests, such as skin or mucosa scrapings; blood, throat, or urine&#xD;
           cultures; and tissue biopsies, if needed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients begin treatment with standard medications for their eye disease, such as&#xD;
      trifluridine (ViropticÂ® (Registered Trademark)) anti-viral eye drops. Patients whose&#xD;
      condition becomes serious are offered additional treatment with intravenous (through a vein)&#xD;
      infusions of either VIG or placebo (salt water solution with no active drug) and are randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one or the other treatment group. All patients continue standard-of-care&#xD;
      treatment as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits at the NIH eye clinic are scheduled as required by the patient's condition.&#xD;
      Patients with mild complications who are taking only standard medications may need to be seen&#xD;
      only 1 month after the initial visit and then 6 months and 12 months later. Patients with&#xD;
      more serious conditions who qualify for VIG or placebo treatments may be seen daily for a&#xD;
      week, then once a week for the rest of the first month, and then at 6 months and 12 months,&#xD;
      unless more frequent treatment or observation is required.&#xD;

      Vaccinia virus (a live but relatively weak relative of smallpox and cowpox) is used to&#xD;
      vaccinate people against the development of smallpox (variola) resulting from an infection&#xD;
      with the viral genus Orthopoxvirus. Although, smallpox was thought to be eradicated worldwide&#xD;
      during the 1970's, some smallpox cultures have been retained in the laboratories of several&#xD;
      countries and may pose a potential threat if used as a biological weapon. This has recently&#xD;
      led to programs where mass-inoculations with vaccinia have been initiated throughout the U.S.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccination against smallpox using vaccinia can result in complications. Reactions are rarely&#xD;
      serious or life threatening, but one of the most common serious complications occur in and&#xD;
      around the eye. This occurs when a person transfers vaccinia viruses by touch from their&#xD;
      primary inoculation site to their own eyes (auto-inoculation). Accidental exposure can also&#xD;
      occur in the laboratory or by contact with a vaccinated person. Ocular involvement may be&#xD;
      confined to the lids or conjunctiva but may easily be transferred to the cornea. Keratitis&#xD;
      can result in scarring that could have a severe and permanent impact on vision. Even when the&#xD;
      cornea is not affected, extensive lesions on the lid or other ocular tissues can lead to&#xD;
      additional sight-threatening complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration licenced Vaccinia Immune Globulin Intravenous&#xD;
      (Human) (VIGIV, formerly known as NP-016). It is indicated for the &quot;treatment and/or&#xD;
      modification of the following conditions, which are complications resulting from smallpox&#xD;
      vaccination: (a) Eczema vaccinatum; (b) Progressive vaccinia; (c) Severe generalized&#xD;
      vaccinia; (d) Vaccinia infections in individuals who have skin conditions such as burns,&#xD;
      impetigo, varicella-zoster, or poison ivy; or individuals who have eczematous skin lesions&#xD;
      because of either the activity or extensiveness of such lesions; and (e) Aberrant infections&#xD;
      induced by vaccinia virus that includes its accidental implantation in eyes (except in cases&#xD;
      of isolated keratitis), mouth, or other areas where vaccinia infection would constitute a&#xD;
      special hazard.&quot; The precautionary statement regarding isolated vaccinia keratitis appears&#xD;
      though it is uncertain whether VIGIV use will decrease or increase corneal scarring in&#xD;
      humans. The implication of increased scarringis based on some evidence in animal models&#xD;
      indicating that more extensive corneal clouding can occur following VIG therapy. To&#xD;
      investigate if this implication has clinical significance, two hundred study participants&#xD;
      with corneal involvement following vaccinia vaccination or other exposure will be randomized&#xD;
      to receive either placebo or VIGIV. All enrolled participants will be provided&#xD;
      standard-of-care antiviral treatments for ocular complications. One-year proportions of&#xD;
      corneal scarring will be compared between the two groups. Further knowledge about the&#xD;
      biologic mechanisms of complications associated with vaccinia vaccination and rapid&#xD;
      diagnostic test may lead to more effective forms of therapy.&#xD;

             participate was obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The participant must have received the vaccinia vaccination, been exposed to a person&#xD;
             vaccinated with vaccinia who has skin lesions, or been exposed directly to accidental&#xD;
             splash of the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have signs and symptoms consistent with ocular vaccinia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. To be eligible for randomization the participant must have corneal involvement defined&#xD;
             as a keratitis with any abnormality of the epithelium, stroma, or endothelium&#xD;
             consistent with vaccinia infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be randomized to the VIGIV/placebo treatment, a proposed participant must not satisfy&#xD;
        the following exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Children with body weight less than 10 kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have a known severe reaction to the IV or IM administration of human immunoglobulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have known severe acute allergic reactions to the non-active ingredients of&#xD;
             polysorbate 80, maltose, or the trace amounts of TNBP or Triton X-100 used in the&#xD;
             preparation of VIGIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has received VIGIV within 6 months prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Pregnant women, unless an approved, specific additional consent statement attesting to&#xD;
             awareness of the unknown risk of VIGIV therapy during pregnancy is understood and&#xD;
             signed by the participant.&#xD;
