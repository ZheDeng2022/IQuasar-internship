  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the use of [11C]NNC-112 in positron emission tomography (PET)&#xD;
      scanning. PET is a technique that uses radioactive isotopes called tracers to provide images&#xD;
      of the brain. Injected into the body, the isotopes lose their &quot;radioactive strength&quot; over&#xD;
      time, sending out rays that can be picked up and &quot;seen&quot; by special detectors connected to a&#xD;
      computer. The computer then makes a picture of the brain. This study will examine the&#xD;
      distribution in the body of a new tracer called [11C]NNC-112.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 70 years of age may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates are screened with a physical examination and blood and urine tests, including a&#xD;
      urine drug screen. Women up to age 55 also have a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants have a PET scan using the [11C]NNC-112 tracer. For this procedure, a catheter&#xD;
      (small plastic tube) is placed into a vein in the subject's arm for injecting the tracer.&#xD;
      Then, the subject lies on the scanner bed. After a preliminary &quot;transmission scan,&quot; the&#xD;
      tracer is injected, and PET scans are taken from the head to the upper thigh over a period of&#xD;
      about 2 hours to show the distribution of radioactivity in the body. Blood pressure,&#xD;
      breathing rate, and heart rate are checked before and after injection of the tracer, and&#xD;
      blood and urine samples are collected after the PET scan.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Abnormalities in dopaminergic neurotransmission have been implicated in several&#xD;
      neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia,&#xD;
      attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder and drug dependence. Among the Dopamine (DA)&#xD;
      receptors, D1 receptors are understood to be involved in the regulation of motor and&#xD;
      cognitive activity by modulating DAergic function. Neuroreceptor imaging with Positron&#xD;
      Emission Tomography (PET) and Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography (SPECT) allows&#xD;
      in vivo quantification of the density and distribution of D1 receptors in humans. Recently, a&#xD;
      new and superior PET radioligand for in vivo quantification of D1 receptors in extrastriatal&#xD;
      regions has been developed. [11C]NNC-112 is a D1 radiotracer with high specific to&#xD;
      nonspecific binding, making it suitable for imaging low density D1 receptors in extrastriatal&#xD;
      regions such as the neocortex. Several studies in humans have confirmed the potential of this&#xD;
      radiotracer, however, to date, dosimetry studies of [11C]NNC-112 in humans have not been&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objective of this protocol is to estimate radiation-absorbed doses of&#xD;
      [11C]NNC-112 in human subjects. For this purpose, we propose to perform a kinetic whole body&#xD;
      imaging study of [11C]NNC-112 in healthy human subjects. We hypothesize that the level of&#xD;
      radiation-absorbed doses of [11C]NNC-112 in humans will be within limits, and consequently,&#xD;
      we should be able to move to the next stage of our imaging research, where we will use this&#xD;
      radioligand to measure the density and distribution of D1 receptors in Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
