  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find a safe dose of a new medicine called antibody 8H9.&#xD;
      Antibodies are made by the body to fight infections and in some cases, to fight tumors. The&#xD;
      antibody 8H9 is made by mice and can attack many kinds of tumors. 8H9 antibody can have a&#xD;
      dose of radiation attached to it called 131-I. 131I-8H9 has been given in the vein to&#xD;
      patients to find cancer cells. This is the first study using 131I-8H9 in the fluid in the&#xD;
      spine to kill cancer cells. 131-I is a beta emitting isotope used extensively for radiation&#xD;
      targeted therapies.&#xD;

    <description>This is a Phase I trial designed to evaluate the Maximally Tolerated Dose (MTD) of intrathecal 131I-8H9. In order to find the MTD, a dose escalation scheme will be employed with patients entering in cohorts of 3 at each dose level from 10 mCi to 60 mCi and a cohort of 6 at each dose level from 70 mCi to 100 mCi.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Subject Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of a malignancy known to be&#xD;
             8H9 reactive. 8H9 expression must be confirmed by immunohistochemical staining of&#xD;
             tumor and assessed by the Department of Pathology or by immunofluorescence of bone&#xD;
             marrow except for patients confirmed to have neuroblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have CNS/ leptomeningeal disease which is refractory to conventional&#xD;
             therapies or for which no conventional therapy exists OR a recurrent brain tumors with&#xD;
             a predilection for leptomeningeal dissemination (medulloblastoma, PNET, rhabdoid&#xD;
             tumor).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have no rapidly progressing or deteriorating neurologic examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1000/ul and a platelet count &gt;&#xD;
             50,000/ul.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have active malignancy outside the central nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Both pediatric and adult patients of any age are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients or a legal guardian will sign an informed consent form approved by the IRB&#xD;
             and obtained by the Principal or a Co- Investigator before patient entry. Minors will&#xD;
             provide assent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with stored stem cells will be treated at the escalating dose while patients&#xD;
             with no stem cells will be treated at the 50 mCi dose. Neuroblastoma patients can be&#xD;
             treated at the 50 mCi dose with or without stored stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subject Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with obstructive or symptomatic communicating hydrocephalus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with an uncontrolled life-threatening infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are pregnant: Pregnant women are excluded for fear of danger to the&#xD;
             fetus. Therefore negative pregnancy test is required for all women of child-bearing&#xD;
             age, and appropriate contraception is required during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received cranial or spinal irradiation less than 3 weeks prior to&#xD;
             the start of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received systemic chemotherapy (corticosteroids not included) less&#xD;
             than 3 weeks prior to the start of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe major organ toxicity. Specifically, renal, cardiac, hepatic, pulmonary, and&#xD;
             gastrointestinal system toxicity should all be less than grade 2. Patients with stable&#xD;
             neurological deficits (because of their brain tumor) are not excluded. Patients with&#xD;
             &lt;= 3 hearing loss are not excluded.&#xD;
