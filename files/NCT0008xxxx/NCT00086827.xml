  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well FR901228 works in treating patients with recurrent&#xD;
      small cell lung cancer. FR901228 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes&#xD;
      necessary for their growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the response rate of patients with histologically or cytologically proven&#xD;
      small cell lung cancer (SCLC) treated with depsipeptide in the &quot;sensitive&quot; relapse setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the overall survival and failure-free survival of patients with histologically&#xD;
      proven recurrent SCLC treated with depsipeptide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the toxicity of depsipeptide in patients with relapsed SCLC. III. To evaluate&#xD;
      surrogate biological markers from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and buccal epithelial&#xD;
      cells: p53 acetylation, histone acetylation, p21CIP1 expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive FR901228 (depsipeptide) IV over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 28 days for at least 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients who have continuing tumor response or stable disease after 6&#xD;
      courses receive 2 additional courses beyond best response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 3 years.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Either histologic or cytologic documentation of recurrent small cell lung carcinoma&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  No more than 1 prior chemotherapy regimen; must have recurrent disease after treatment&#xD;
             with a platinum agent (either cisplatin or carboplatin); prior chemotherapy must have&#xD;
             been completed ≥90 days prior to documentation of relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  &gt;= 4 weeks since prior radiation therapy; prior radiation therapy is allowed either in&#xD;
             the context of curative intent combined modality treatment for limited stage disease,&#xD;
             prophylactic cranial radiation or palliative radiation (to the chest, brain, or other&#xD;
             sites) initially or at relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior surgery is allowed provided patients have completely recovered from effects of&#xD;
             procedure and &gt;= 2 weeks have elapsed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior treatment with depsipeptide&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with treated/controlled brain mets (defined as no need for further radiation&#xD;
             and no requirements for steroids to control peri-tumoral edema) are eligible for this&#xD;
             study; however, patients requiring treatment with enzyme inducing anti-convulsant&#xD;
             drugs are not eligible; these include, but are not limited to, phenytoin,&#xD;
             phenobarbital, carbamazepine, felbamate and primidone&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All Patients must have Measurable Disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately&#xD;
                  measured in at least one dimension; the longest diameter of measurable lesions&#xD;
                  must be &gt;= 20 mm with conventional techniques or &gt;= 10 mm with spiral CT scan;&#xD;
                  lesions that are not considered measurable include the following:&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  Cystic lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG Performance Status 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No significant cardiac disease, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Congestive heart failure that meets New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III/IV&#xD;
             definitions, history of myocardial infarction within one year of study entry,&#xD;
             uncontrolled dysrhythmias, or poorly controlled angina&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of serious ventricular arrhythmia (VT or VF, &gt;= 3 beats in a row), QTc &gt;= 500&#xD;
             msec, or LVEF =&lt; 40% by MUGA&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy by echocardiographic criteria or by EKG&#xD;
             criteria (Cornell voltage criteria):&#xD;
&#xD;
        For Men: S in V3 plus R in aVL &gt; 2.8 mV (28mm) For Women: S in V3 + R in aVL &gt; 2.0 mV&#xD;
        (20mm)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be co-medicated with an agent that causes QTc prolongation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when&#xD;
             treated with marrow-suppressive therapy; therefore, HIV-positive patients receiving&#xD;
             combination anti-retroviral therapy are not eligible because of possible&#xD;
             pharmacokinetic interactions with depsipeptide&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No current treatment with potassium wasting diuretics (e.g., hydroclorothiazide);&#xD;
             patients on such diuretics should be switched to a potassium sparing diuretic or&#xD;
             another antihypertensive medication prior to registration&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-pregnant and non-nursing because of significant risk to the fetus/infant; the&#xD;
             effects of depsipeptide on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic&#xD;
             dose are unknown; for this reason and because histone deacetylase inhibitors are known&#xD;
             to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to and&#xD;
             for the entire duration of participation and for at least 6 weeks after completion of&#xD;
             treatment&#xD;
