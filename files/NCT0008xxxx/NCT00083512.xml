  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will collect blood and urine samples from patients undergoing radiation therapy&#xD;
      for glioblastoma multiforme (a type of brain tumor) to investigate the effects of this&#xD;
      treatment on blood cells and certain proteins. The information from this study may help&#xD;
      scientists develop new tests to measure radiation exposure and find new ways to treat cancer&#xD;
      with radiation, and help determine which kinds of patients or tumors respond better to&#xD;
      radiation therapy. Two proteins of particular interest in this study and which may be&#xD;
      involved in the recurrence of cancer are VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) and MMPs&#xD;
      (matrix metalloproteinases).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with glioblastoma multiforme who are receiving or will&#xD;
      receive radiation therapy as part of their medical treatment may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates are screened with a history and physical examination, blood tests, and magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have blood and urine samples collected before, during and after completion&#xD;
      of their radiation treatment. Urine samples are collected in a cup and about 2 tablespoons of&#xD;
      blood are withdrawn through a needle in a vein. Additional samples may be requested at&#xD;
      different times during treatment and in the 3-year follow-up period.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preliminary data generated from our pilot protocol 02-C-0064 suggests that the urinary&#xD;
           VEGF and MMP level at the one month follow-up time point compared to the last&#xD;
           on-treatment time point collection may be predictive of tumor recurrence at one year&#xD;
           (l).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Note that this preliminary study included patients with all histologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In an on ongoing effort to validate our results with a larger more homogeneous patient&#xD;
           cohort we propose to prospectively study patients undergoing radiotherapy for GBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      -We will determine whether VEGF and MMP level measurements aide in predicting tumor&#xD;
      recurrence at 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Patients seen in the radiation oncology clinic will be asked to provide samples of blood and&#xD;
      urine before, during and after their radiation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This protocol-provides a means of acquiring blood and urine samples from patients&#xD;
           receiving radiation therapy for Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be analyzed according to their Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)&#xD;
           recursive partitioning prognostic subgroups, which includes patient age, KPS, extent of&#xD;
           resection and neurological function.&#xD;
