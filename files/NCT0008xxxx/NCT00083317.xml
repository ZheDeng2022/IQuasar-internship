      This study will identify which areas of the brain mediate the interaction between people&#xD;
      involved in economic decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy, right-handed native English speakers between 21 and 55 years of age may be eligible&#xD;
      for this study. Candidates are screened with a telephone interview, a questionnaire to&#xD;
      determine handedness, and a neurological examination if one has not been performed within the&#xD;
      last year by an NIH physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants bargain for money by playing two-person trust games, while undergoing functional&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain&#xD;
      images of body organs and tissues. The MRI scanner is a metal cylinder surrounded by a strong&#xD;
      magnetic field. During the procedure, the subject lies on a stable that can slide in and out&#xD;
      of the scanner, wearing earplugs to muffle loud knocking sounds that occur with electrical&#xD;
      switching of the magnetic fields. Functional MRI involves taking MRI scans while the subject&#xD;
      performs a task-this to learn about how the brain regions are involved in performing the&#xD;
      task. For this test, the subject plays or watches two-person games involving trust. The game&#xD;
      may be played against a stranger or a friend. The winner receives a cash payoff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject performs one of the following two tasks during MRI scanning:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Playing the trust games and indicating as quickly as possible by pressing a right or&#xD;
           left button whether he or she wants to stop or continue playing, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Observing games that others have played and predicting as quickly as possible by&#xD;
           pressing a right or left button whether the players wanted to stop or continue the&#xD;
           games.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test takes about 90 minutes. After the scan, participants complete written questionnaires&#xD;
      about their experience in the scanner and their views on issues related to participating in&#xD;
      competitive games.&#xD;

      Objective. The purpose of the protocol is to identify the brain regions mediating the social&#xD;
      cooperation involved in economic decision-making, including whether negative mood and&#xD;
      perceived interpersonal similarity affect behavior or brain regions utilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population. Healthy, normal adult volunteers will play and observe two-person&#xD;
      reciprocal trust games during functional neuroimaging against either real people or computers&#xD;
      masquerading as real people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design. A between/within-subject, rapid event-related fMRI design will be employed for two&#xD;
      series of experiments. In the first experiment, two persons-each in a separate MRI&#xD;
      scanner-will interact with one another playing two-person reciprocal trust games while their&#xD;
      brains are simultaneously scanned. In the second experiment, a third person will later&#xD;
      observe the played games while in a scanner, trying to predict the decisions of the two other&#xD;
      players in the first experiment. In the third experiment, a sad mood will be induced in half&#xD;
      of the participants to examine if it affects levels of cooperative behavior and patterns of&#xD;
      brain activation in the two types of trust games described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four additional series of experiments will employ between/within subject designs in which&#xD;
      subjects are scanned alone, but under the deception that they are playing simultaneously with&#xD;
      another subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures. The data collected will consist of behavioral measures of cognitive&#xD;
      performance, self- and other-mental representation, trusting and trustworthy behavior,&#xD;
      corresponding fMRI images, personality scales, ratings of relationship and status, and types&#xD;
      of strategy used. The results gained from this protocol will be of value in identifying a set&#xD;
      of neural regions mediating dynamic social interaction between people engaged in economic&#xD;
      decision-making.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        In all the studies, subjects will consist of healthy, native English-speaking, right-handed&#xD;
        volunteers, as measured by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (Oldfield, 1971). Subjects&#xD;
        will range in age from 21 to 55 years old and they will be included regardless of race.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Non-native English speakers and non-right handers will be excluded as mentioned above, as&#xD;
        will non-neurologically normal volunteers. Subjects younger than 21 and older than 55 will&#xD;
        be excluded. A urine pregnancy test will be employed with all women of childbearing age.&#xD;
        The results must be negative in order to proceed with the MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants with any of the following: aneurysm clip; implanted neural stimulator;&#xD;
        implanted cardiac pacemaker or auto-defibrillator; cochlear implant; ocular foreign body,&#xD;
        e.g. metal shavings; permanent eyeliner; insulin pump; or irremovable body piercing will be&#xD;
        excluded from the study due to the possible dangerous effects of the magnet upon metal&#xD;
        objects in the body. Participants taking central nervous system active medications will be&#xD;
        excluded.&#xD;
