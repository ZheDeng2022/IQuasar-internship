  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      STR (Skeletal Targeted Radiotherapy, 166Ho-DOTMP) is an investigational radiopharmaceutical&#xD;
      that delivers radiation directly to cancer cells in the bone and bone marrow. Conventional&#xD;
      methods of delivering radiation therapy, such as total body irradiation, expose non-target&#xD;
      tissues to radiation and cause serious side effects. In contrast, STR's targeted approach to&#xD;
      delivering radiotherapy concentrates the radiation where it is needed, and minimizes exposure&#xD;
      of normal tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STR is composed of a bone-targeting molecule, DOTMP, in a stable complex with the&#xD;
      radionuclide holmium-166. When injected into a patient's bloodstream, STR rapidly binds to&#xD;
      bone mineral, delivering a brief, intense dose of radiation to destroy cancer cells in the&#xD;
      bone and marrow. The high-energy and long path-length of holmium-166 beta particles provide&#xD;
      optimal penetration and uniform irradiation of disease sites in the marrow and bone. STR that&#xD;
      does not bind to bone is rapidly eliminated through the urinary tract. STR treatment is&#xD;
      followed by autologous stem cell transplantation. The short half-life of holmium-166 allows&#xD;
      treatment on an out-patient basis, and minimizes the time required between STR administration&#xD;
      and transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase III study of STR is a multi-center, randomized, controlled study, designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of STR in patients with primary refractory multiple myeloma.&#xD;
      These are patients who have failed to achieve at least a partial response to conventional&#xD;
      therapy and have been undergoing treatment for less than 18 months. The trial is expected to&#xD;
      enroll approximately 240 evaluable patients, half on the experimental arm and half on the&#xD;
      control arm. Patients on the experimental arm will receive STR at a dose of 750 mCi/m2 plus&#xD;
      the chemotherapy drug melphalan at 200 mg/m2, followed by autologous stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation. Patients on the control arm will receive melphalan only, followed by&#xD;
      transplantation. Patients on both study arms will be evaluated for response to treatment six&#xD;
      months after transplantation, using an immunofixation assay to detect myeloma protein in&#xD;
      patient samples. Analysis of patient samples will be conducted at a central laboratory, and&#xD;
      blinded results will be reviewed by an independent panel of experts. The study's primary&#xD;
      endpoint is complete response, as determined by the complete disappearance of myeloma protein&#xD;
      at six months post-transplant.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.To determine the efficacy of STR (166Ho-DOTMP). The primary endpoint of this study is to&#xD;
      compare the CR rate at 6 months post-transplant (in the absence of further therapy) in&#xD;
      subjects with primary refractory multiple myeloma after treatment with 750 mCi/m2 166Ho-DOTMP&#xD;
      plus 200 mg/m2 melphalan followed by autologous PBSCT to treatment with 200 mg/m2 melphalan&#xD;
      alone followed by autologous PBSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the treatment groups with respect to survival and progression-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare treatment groups with respect to overall response rate (CR+VGPR+PR), best&#xD;
           response within 6 months, and duration of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the safety profile of the treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess the biodistribution and estimated radiation absorbed dose to kidney in the&#xD;
           first 20 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY: Informed consent for participation in the study will be obtained, eligibility&#xD;
      determined, and the subject registered. All subjects will receive a tracer dose of 30 mCi&#xD;
      166Ho-DOTMP to determine skeletal uptake and biodistribution of 166Ho-DOTMP therapy. Subjects&#xD;
      may receive a therapy dose only if 1) the tracer dose shows no aberrant distribution, and 2)&#xD;
      if the skeletal residence time is at least 5.8 hours (equivalent to F x Te &gt; 4 hr). Subjects&#xD;
      with adequate skeletal uptake and no aberrant distribution will be stratified based on the&#xD;
      length of time since first induction therapy, and on response to prior therapy, and will&#xD;
      undergo randomization to determine whether they will receive 166Ho DOTMP plus melphalan (Arm&#xD;
      A) or melphalan alone (Arm B) as the conditioning regimen prior to autologous PBSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects randomized to Arm A will be treated with 750 mCi/m2 166Ho DOTMP intravenously 4 to&#xD;
      12 days after the tracer dose, with a total dosage not to exceed 1500 mCi. Five to 9 days&#xD;
      after the 166Ho-DOTMP therapy dose, subjects will receive 200 mg/m2 melphalan IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects randomized to Arm B will receive 200 mg/m2 melphalan at least 10 days and no more&#xD;
      than 3 weeks after the tracer dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all patients, cryopreserved hematopoietic stem cells will be infused 24 to 48 hours after&#xD;
      melphalan. Subjects will be followed for safety assessments for 10 years or until death.&#xD;
      Efficacy will be evaluated for up to 3 years in responding subjects, and disease relapse or&#xD;
      progression and survival will be documented until Year 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An analysis to estimate radiation dose to the kidney will be performed in the first 20&#xD;
      patients. Additionally, after 6 months of follow-up have been completed on the first 20&#xD;
      subjects in each arm, an analysis of the CR rate will be conducted to rule out lack of&#xD;
      efficacy of 166Ho-DOTMP. A planned interim analysis to determine the efficacy of the&#xD;
      treatment will be performed when 60 patients on each arm have completed 6 months of&#xD;
      follow-up. Enrollment on trial will continue while these interim analyses are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NUMBER OF SUBJECTS: Two hundred and forty subjects who meet the eligibility criteria and&#xD;
      receive study treatment will be followed on this protocol.&#xD;
