  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized phase II trial of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) drug&#xD;
      immunoconjugate, SGN-15, administered weekly in combination with weekly docetaxel. The&#xD;
      primary objective of the study is to determine the optimal interval between SGN-15 and&#xD;
      docetaxel using FDG-PET imaging as a surrogate marker of response. In addition, clinical&#xD;
      response rate, duration of response, and survival data will be collected.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SGN-15 is a mAb-drug immunoconjugate comprised of the chimeric anti-Lewis Y (LeY) mAb BR96,&#xD;
      conjugated to doxorubicin. The LeY antigen is found as a glycoprotein at the cell surface on&#xD;
      90% of carcinomas of the lung. SGN-15 induces its antitumor effect through binding to the&#xD;
      cell surface LeY antigen. It is then rapidly internalized with release of doxorubicin inside&#xD;
      the cell allowing the relative sparing of tissues normally affected by non-specific&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is open to patients with good performance status (ECOG 0&lt;=2) with stage IIIB or IV&#xD;
      NSCLC which is not potentially curable by surgery or combined modality therapy and who have&#xD;
      received no prior lung cancer chemotherapy for metastatic NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be registered into one of two treatment sequences and wil receive SGN-15 and&#xD;
      docetaxel in 4 week cycles consisting of treatment weekly for 3 weeks, followed by a week of&#xD;
      rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A will receive a combination os SGN-15 and docetaxel on the same day. Arm B will receive&#xD;
      the combination of SGN-15 followed by the docetaxel 3 days later. All patients will undergo&#xD;
      PET imaging prior to treatment and on Day 22.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients achieving a clinical response or stable disease as determined by physical&#xD;
      examination and/or traditional restaging studies (using established RECIST criteria) after&#xD;
      one 4 week cycle of therapy are eligible to receive continued cycles of SGN-15 and docetaxel&#xD;
      on the same schedule until clinical or radiographic disease progression or toxicity occurs.&#xD;
