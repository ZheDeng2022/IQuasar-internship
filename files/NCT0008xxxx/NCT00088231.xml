  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest safe doses of PTK 787&#xD;
      (vatalanib) and Gleevec (imatinib mesylate) that can be given to treat Chronic Myelogenous&#xD;
      Leukemia-Blastic Phase (CML-BP), Refractory Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML), or Agnogenic&#xD;
      Myeloid Metaplasia (AMM). Another goal is to see how effective this combination treatment is.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: The purpose of this study is to combine PTK-787, a potent orally vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor inhibitor (in disorders where VEGF is known to be&#xD;
      involved in the pathophysiology), with Imatinib mesylate (IM), a protein-tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitor of abl, Bcr-Abl, platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), and c-Kit (in same&#xD;
      disorders where these kinases are believed to be important). The potential synergy between&#xD;
      oral agents that inhibit these kinases in disorders where each of the two agents have some,&#xD;
      but inadequate, single agent activity is being studied in this protocol. We will also have an&#xD;
      opportunity to assess if there is any correlation between response and individual kinase&#xD;
      mutations e.g., c-Kit in patients with AML. If improved outcomes are observed, further&#xD;
      studies will be indicated to investigate which, if either, agent is predominantly responsible&#xD;
      for such a benefit - these studies will be facilitated by the availability of more potent&#xD;
      e.g., (AMN107 as an abl inhibitor), (Bevacizumab, AG013736 as VEGF inhibitors) agents which&#xD;
      will help to define the relative importance of the various inhibitory activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To determine the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of PTK&#xD;
      787 and imatinib mesylate, when given in combination to patients with refractory acute&#xD;
      myelogenous leukemia (AML), agnogenic myeloid metaplasia (AMM) and chronic myelogenous&#xD;
      leukemia in blastic phase (CML-BP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the efficacy (response rate, survival, time to progression, time to treatment&#xD;
      failure, duration of response) of the MTD in these study populations.&#xD;

    <description>For 1 week prior to receipt of study combination regimen, all patients will receive single agent PTK 787 at dose specified for that dose level of the study combination regimen to allow stabilization of PTK 787 levels. Patients should not have a grade 3 or 4 PTK 787-related adverse events in order to begin study combination therapy with a imatinib on day 8. On Day 8, PTK 787 250 mg by mouth every day and imatinib 600 mg by mouth every day (for Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML), Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia- blastic phase (CML-BP) and imatinib 400 mg by mouth every day (for Agnogenic Myeloid Metaplasia (AMM). Length of therapy is four courses; each course equals 28 days. Patients assessed for response after each course.</description>

             of treatment, hydroxyurea may be given at a maximum dose of 5 g daily for up to a&#xD;
             total of 7 days. For leukopheresis, a maximum of 2 procedures per week or 4 procedures&#xD;

             limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, not limited to, ongoing uncontrolled&#xD;

             vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, bowel obstruction, or inability to swallow&#xD;
             the tablets).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with confirmed diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are&#xD;
             excluded - A separate study for patients with HIV will be performed if indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because PTK 787 and imatinib may have a&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with PTK 787 or imatinib, breastfeeding patients will not be eligible.&#xD;
