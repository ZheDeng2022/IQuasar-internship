      This study will test the safety of a drug called EW-A-401 in patients with intermittent&#xD;
      claudication - pain and discomfort in the legs due to blockages of the arteries. The study&#xD;
      will also evaluate whether EW-A-401 improves blood flow to the legs. EW-A-401 contains&#xD;
      genetic material (DNA) that instructs the body to produce specific proteins that promote the&#xD;
      growth of new blood vessels and may, therefore, improve blood flow to the legs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 21 years of age and older with pain or discomfort of one or both legs due to&#xD;
      blockages of the arteries below the groin may be eligible for this study. Candidates are&#xD;
      screened with a medical history, physical examination, blood and urine tests, eye&#xD;
      examination, chest x-ray and CT scan of the chest, and treadmill tests. Patients who are able&#xD;
      to exercise more than 12 minutes on the treadmill may not enroll in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Muscle biopsy: On the first day of the study, patients have a muscle biopsy. This&#xD;
           procedure is done under local anesthesia with mild sedation. A 1-inch incision is cut&#xD;
           into the skin over a calf muscle and a small amount of muscle tissue is removed for&#xD;
           examination by a pathologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drug treatment and tests: About 10 to 13 days after the biopsy, patients are admitted to&#xD;
           the NIH Clinical Center for 3 to 5 days for drug treatment and tests. They receive 10&#xD;
           injections of either the study drug (EW-A-401) or placebo (an inactive substance) in&#xD;
           each leg during a single session lasting about 1 hour. In addition, they have blood and&#xD;
           urine tests, complete questionnaires about their symptoms, and undergo magnetic&#xD;
           resonance imaging (MRI), a test that a magnetic field and radio waves to produce&#xD;
           detailed images of body tissues and organs. For this procedure, the patient lies on a&#xD;
           table that slides into the scanner (a large hollow tube) for imaging of the blood&#xD;
           vessels in the legs. Patients wear headphones to muffle loud knocking and thumping&#xD;
           sounds that occur during the scanning process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30-day follow-up: Patients return to the Clinical Center three times over 30 days&#xD;
           following the hospital stay for a medical history, physical examination, and blood and&#xD;
           urine tests to assess the safety of EW-A-401.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Extended follow-up: Patients return to the Clinical Center at 3, 6, and 12 months after&#xD;
           hospitalization for a medical history and physical examination, blood and urine tests,&#xD;
           two treadmill tests, questionnaires about symptoms, and MRI studies, including imaging&#xD;
           for blood flow measurement. Blood flow to the legs is measured during MRI using large&#xD;
           blood pressure cuffs inflated around the legs during the scanning. The cuffs are&#xD;
           inflated very tightly for 5 minutes, and then a dye is injected into an arm vein to&#xD;
           brighten the images. Additional pictures are taken over the next 5 to 10 minutes. At two&#xD;
           of these follow-up visits, patients also have an eye examination, and at the 3- or&#xD;
           6-month visit they have a repeat muscle biopsy of the calf.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study lasts 12 months. After 6 months, patients will be told whether they received&#xD;
      EW-A-401 or placebo. Because EW-A-401 is so new, patients will continue to be contacted every&#xD;
      year after the study is completed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Lower limb intermittent claudication, muscular pain with exercise relieved promptly by rest,&#xD;
      is a disabling syndrome affecting over 10 million patients in the United States. Intermittent&#xD;
      claudication is caused by peripheral artery atherosclerosis, the same disease causing heart&#xD;
      attack. Peripheral artery atherosclerosis impairs blood flow to skeletal muscles in the lower&#xD;
      limbs. Growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A), have been shown&#xD;
      in animal studies to improve blood flow the lower limbs by promoting the growth of new blood&#xD;
      vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical study tests the safety and feasibility of gene transfer of an agent (EW-A-401)&#xD;
      intended to improve blood flow in the skeletal muscle of subjects with intermittent&#xD;
      claudication. The investigational agent is a circle of genetic material (plasmid DNA) that&#xD;
      instructs the body to produce a genetically-engineered transcription factor, a protein that&#xD;
      regulates expression of genes. This specific transcription factor has been shown in animal&#xD;
      studies to increase expression of the VEGF-A gene, and to promote the growth of new blood&#xD;
      vessels. The study agent will be delivered by injection into leg muscle during a single&#xD;
      session. This is the first human experience using this transcription factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has a randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation, placebo-controlled design. The&#xD;
      primary outcome measure will be safety and toxicity. In addition, we will collect exploratory&#xD;
      effectiveness information including blood flow, walking capacity, quality of life, and&#xD;
      inspection of blood vessels on samples of leg muscle.&#xD;
