      PRO 2000 Gel is designed to be inserted into the vagina to protect women from getting HIV&#xD;
      during sex. So far, PRO 2000 Gel has been tested for safety in 136 women from Europe and the&#xD;
      United States. This study will evaluate the safety and acceptability of PRO 2000 Gel when&#xD;
      used by women in Pune, India. The study will also examine what Indian women and men think&#xD;
      about using PRO 2000 Gel.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Topical microbicides are designed to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV and other disease&#xD;
      pathogens. PRO 2000/5 Gel (P), or PRO 2000, is a vaginal microbicide that has been evaluated&#xD;
      in Phase I safety trials in Europe and the U.S. PRO 2000 Gel is easily manufactured, highly&#xD;
      stable, and highly water-soluble. The aqueous gel formulation contains a synthetic carbomer,&#xD;
      a lactic acid/lactate buffer, and preservatives. In vitro, PRO 2000 Gel has been shown to&#xD;
      suppress infection by herpes viruses, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and a&#xD;
      wide range of HIV-1 isolates. This study will evaluate the safety and acceptability of PRO&#xD;
      2000 Gel in HIV uninfected women in Pune, India. The study is a precursor to a larger Phase&#xD;
      II/III study of PRO 2000 Gel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be sexually active HIV uninfected women at either low or high&#xD;
      risk for HIV infection. Male partners of these women will also be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to apply PRO 2000 Gel twice a day for 14 consecutive days between&#xD;
      menses and to have vaginal intercourse with a single male partner, using study-provided male&#xD;
      condoms, at least twice per week during the two weeks of PRO 2000 Gel use. Participants will&#xD;
      have a screening visit, an enrollment visit, and 3 study visits during the two weeks of PRO&#xD;
      2000 Gel use; each visit will last about 1 hour. Study visits will include a medical history,&#xD;
      gynecologic exam, blood and urine tests, and product acceptability questionnaires. Colposcopy&#xD;
      will be performed three times during the study. Participants will also be asked to complete a&#xD;
      Daily Study Record about product use and sexual activity and questionnaires about their&#xD;
      willingness to use the product and their perceptions of the product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four weeks after using PRO 2000 Gel, participants will be asked to participate in a focus&#xD;
      group to discuss product acceptability. Participants' male partners will also be asked to&#xD;
      participate in focus groups about product use.&#xD;
