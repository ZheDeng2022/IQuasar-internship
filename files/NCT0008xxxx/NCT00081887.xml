      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of clofarabine in Chronic Lymphocytic&#xD;
           Leukemia (CLL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the toxicity profile of clofarabine in CLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate the plasma clofarabine and cellular clofarabine triphosphate pharmacology&#xD;
           profile of clofarabine in CLL.&#xD;

      Clofarabine is a new chemotherapy drug that is designed to interfere with the growth and&#xD;
      development of cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you can start treatment on the study, you will have what are called &quot;screening tests&quot;.&#xD;
      These tests will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in the study. You&#xD;
      will have a complete medical history and physical examination. You will also be asked about&#xD;
      what medications you are taking currently and about the level of your daily activities.&#xD;
      Routine blood tests (about 2 tablespoons) will be done within 14 days before the start of the&#xD;
      study to make sure that you are not at increased risk for developing side effects. You may&#xD;
      have bone marrow samples collected. To collect a bone marrow sample, an area of the hip or&#xD;
      chest bone is numbed with anesthetic and a small amount of bone marrow is withdrawn through a&#xD;
      large needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible, you will receive clofarabine as a 1-hour infusion into a&#xD;
      vein once once every 2 weeks for 4 weeks. This cycle makes up one treatment course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug is evaluated at different dose levels. The first three patients will start with a&#xD;
      lower dose. Unless serious side effects occur, the next group of patients (usually groups are&#xD;
      3 patients, although they can be expanded to include more patients if needed) will receive a&#xD;
      higher dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you show a response and do not experience any severe side effects, you can receive up to a&#xD;
      total of 6 courses of therapy. During each course, clofarabine is given the same way as&#xD;
      during the first course. However, the dose of clofarabine may be lowered during later courses&#xD;
      to decrease the risk of side effects that may have occurred in previous courses. If the&#xD;
      disease gets worse or you experience any intolerable side effects, you will be taken off the&#xD;
      study and your doctor will discuss other treatment options with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before every treatment course, your doctor will perform a physical exam, including&#xD;
      measurement of your weight and vital signs. You will be asked about the level of your daily&#xD;
      activities and how you are feeling. At least once every two weeks (more often if your doctor&#xD;
      feels it is necessary), you will have blood samples (about 1-2 teaspoons) collected for&#xD;
      routine lab tests. Repeat bone marrows will be collected after the third and sixth course.&#xD;
      However, if you complete the study before the third course, the bone marrow may be taken&#xD;
      then. No bone marrow may be taken if the condition of your disease is obvious from the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will need to stay in Houston for the first 4 weeks of treatment. After that, you may&#xD;
      return to your home but you will still have to return to Houston to receive the clofarabine&#xD;
      treatment. You may choose to have check-up visits and blood tests with your local doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you finished your treatment, and as long you are participating on this study, you will&#xD;
      be scheduled every 3-6 months to check on the status of the disease and your overall health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Clofarabine is authorized by the FDA for use in research&#xD;
      only. Up to 36 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D.&#xD;
      Anderson.&#xD;
