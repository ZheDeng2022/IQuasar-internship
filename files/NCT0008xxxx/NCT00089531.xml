  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate whether an experimental vaccine intended to prevent HIV infection is&#xD;
      safe and whether it causes any side effects. It will also examine whether the vaccine, called&#xD;
      VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP, causes an immune response, and will monitor participants for the social&#xD;
      impact of being in an HIV vaccine study. VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP contains synthetic DNA that&#xD;
      codes for parts of four HIV proteins. It also contains a &quot;promoter&quot; piece of DNA that is&#xD;
      needed to start protein production. The promoter DNA is also synthetic and is like the&#xD;
      promoter in another virus called cytomegalovirus (CMV). The vaccine contains no live HIV&#xD;
      virus or CMV and cannot cause either of these illnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers between 18 and 44 years old who are HIV-negative may be eligible for this&#xD;
      32-week study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination, and&#xD;
      blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive three injections of the experimental vaccine approximately 28 days&#xD;
      apart. The injections are given with a system called the Biojector 2000 that delivers the&#xD;
      vaccine through the skin into the muscle without the use of a needle. Subjects are observed&#xD;
      for side effects for at least 30 minutes after each vaccination and are required to telephone&#xD;
      the clinic staff 1 to 2 days after the injection to report how they are doing. In addition,&#xD;
      they are given a diary card to take home, on which they record their temperature and any&#xD;
      symptoms daily for five days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants return to the clinic two weeks after each injection. They return the completed&#xD;
      diary card and are checked for any health changes or problems since the last visit. They are&#xD;
      asked how they are feeling and what medications, if any, they have taken. Blood and urine&#xD;
      samples are collected. Some subjects may be asked to have laboratory tests between regular&#xD;
      visits if needed to evaluate a change in health. Participants are also asked about any social&#xD;
      effects they may have experienced as a result of their participation in the study.&#xD;

      Study Design: This is a Phase I open label study to evaluate safety, tolerability, and immune&#xD;
      response of a 6-plasmid multiclade HIV-1 DNA vaccine, VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP. The hypothesis is&#xD;
      that this regimen will be safe for human administration and elicit immune responses to HIV-1&#xD;
      clade B Gag, Pol and Nef proteins, as well as clades A, B and C Env proteins. The primary&#xD;
      objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability in humans of the investigational vaccine&#xD;
      and secondary objectives are to evaluate the immunogenicity of the vaccine as measured by&#xD;
      intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) in the 4 weeks after the second or third dose of&#xD;
      vaccine and the social impact of participating in an HIV-1 vaccine trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product Description: VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP is composed of 6 closed, circular DNA plasmids that&#xD;
      are each 16.67 percent (by weight) of the vaccine. Each of the 6 plasmids in this vaccine&#xD;
      expresses a single gene product. Plasmids VRC 4401, VRC 4409 and VRC 4404 are designed to&#xD;
      express clade B HIV-1 Gag, Pol and Nef, respectively. VRC 5736, VRC 5737, and VRC 5738 are&#xD;
      designed to express HIV-1 Env glycoprotein from clade A, clade B, and clade C, respectively.&#xD;
      Vaccine vials will be supplied at 4 mg/mL. Each DNA vaccination will be 1 mL of vaccine&#xD;
      administered intramuscularly (in deltoid muscle) using the Biojector 2000 Needle-Free&#xD;
      Injection Management System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Healthy adult volunteers (18 to 44 years old) will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Plan: Fifteen volunteers will be enrolled, as shown in the schema:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Name of Vaccine: VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Subjects: 15&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccine Injection Schedule: (at least 21 days between injections)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 0: 4 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 28 plus or minus 7: 4 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 56 plus or minus 7: 4 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: 32 weeks clinical follow-up for each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints: The primary endpoint is safety of the regimen; secondary endpoints are&#xD;
&#xD;
      cellular immune responses as measured by ICS within the first 4 weeks after the second and&#xD;
&#xD;
      third doses and social impact at Week 32. Exploratory analyses will include HIV-specific&#xD;
&#xD;
      antibody assays, ICS or other immunological assays at intervals between Day 0 and Week 32.&#xD;
