      The purpose of this study is to determine if cell therapy with your own cells (autologous&#xD;
      cells) delivered with a catheter to regions of the heart with poor blood flow will be safe&#xD;
      and if it will relieve your chest pain and/or your ability to exercise.&#xD;

      The goal of this study is to determine the safety of various doses of autologous (one's own)&#xD;
      stem cells, delivered with a catheter into the regions of the heart with poor blood flow.&#xD;
      Stem cells are primitive cells produced by bone marrow that can develop into blood cells or&#xD;
      other types of cells. In addition to determining whether this new approach is safe, the&#xD;
      diagnostic tests may offer preliminary insights into the usefulness of this approach for&#xD;
      treating myocardial ischemia (the condition where areas in the heart are lacking enough&#xD;
      oxygen and blood flow to keep the heart muscle working well).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a blinded, randomized study to compare a certain type of stem cell called&#xD;
      CD34-positive versus a placebo agent (normal saline). You will have a 3:1 chance of receiving&#xD;
      your CD34-positive stem cells versus the placebo agent (normal saline). You will not know&#xD;
      whether you received the CD34-positive cells or the placebo agent (normal saline). If you are&#xD;
      randomized to receive placebo (normal saline), you will undergo all of the pre-treatment&#xD;
      phases of this study (including the stem cell mobilization phase and the apheresis&#xD;
      procedure), but rather than receiving injections of CD34-positive cells, you will receive&#xD;
      injections of the placebo agent (normal saline). There is some research evidence that&#xD;
      suggests CD34-positive cells may help develop new blood vessels or improve blood flow when&#xD;
      injected directly into the heart muscle.&#xD;
