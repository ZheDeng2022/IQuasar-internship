  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will develop a blood test that can be used to predict a relapse of ovarian,&#xD;
      peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. The type of testing is called proteomics, or the study&#xD;
      of proteins in living cells. The test will identify certain proteins that might represent a&#xD;
      pattern, or &quot;fingerprint,&quot; indicating increased risk of disease relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with Stage III or IV epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian&#xD;
      tube cancer that is in remission may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with&#xD;
      a medical history and physical examination, blood tests, review of pathology report from&#xD;
      surgery, and computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the&#xD;
      abdomen and pelvis (and chest if the cancer spread to the chest).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants have a clinic visit every 3 months for a physical examination (including a&#xD;
      pelvic examination), blood draw for routine and research tests, and review of how they have&#xD;
      been feeling. Every 6 months they have CT scans of the abdomen, pelvis, and possibly the&#xD;
      chest. When a patient has been in remission for 4 years, blood draws are done every 6 months&#xD;
      and CT scans are done yearly. Patients whose cancer returns (based on a CA-125 blood test, CT&#xD;
      scans, or physical examination) end their participation in the study. Patients with an&#xD;
      abnormal CT scan or physical examination may be asked to undergo a tumor biopsy (surgical&#xD;
      removal of a piece of tumor tissue) for research purposes.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over 80% of patients with advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer will relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum biomarkers are needed for predictors of persistent disease and relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
      CA-125 is a less than satisfactory clinical tool for detecting relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
      A serum repository of samples from women with ovarian cancer is needed to develop and&#xD;
      validate the multiple tests being created for ovarian cancer recurrence and screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To create a multi-institutional repository from which investigations of serum proteomic&#xD;
      signature profiles of epithelial ovarian cancer and relapse will be developed and validated&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the sensitivity and specificity of the proteomic signature profiles for relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the accuracy of proteomic evaluation and CA125 in classifying patient disease&#xD;
      progression&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify the temporal relationship between a rise in CA125 value versus the development of&#xD;
      proteomic signature profiles of relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To detect the impact of study participation on quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To collect epidemiological data for patients in the target population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in first remission from treatment of FIGO stage III/IV primary peritoneal, fallopian&#xD;
      tube, or epithelial ovarian carcinoma as defined by normal CA125, no evidence of disease on&#xD;
      abdominopelvic CT scan, and normal post-hysterectomy physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Entry within 12 weeks of last administration of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      S/P surgical debulking and completion of primary therapy with platinum/taxane-containing&#xD;
      chemotherapy of no more than a total of 8 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory evidence of good end organ function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase of Trial: Biomarker/Laboratory Analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients to be enrolled: 400&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned statistical analysis for primary endpoint: Training set to include 100 women, half of&#xD;
      whom are in remission and half of whom have recurrent disease. Validation set will include&#xD;
      200 women, half of whom are in remission and half of whom have recurrent disease.&#xD;

&#xD;
        2.1.5&lt;TAB&gt;Patients who undergo second look laparotomy or laparoscopy and have microscopic&#xD;
        residual disease but who elect not to have treatment will be eligible to enroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2.1.6&lt;TAB&gt;Histology slides adequate to confirm the pathology and staging must be submitted&#xD;
        to the coordinating center within 3 months of enrollment. (If available, a sample of frozen&#xD;
        primary tumor should also be forwarded).&#xD;
&#xD;

        the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2.1.8&lt;TAB&gt;Patients must have laboratory evidence of good end organ function by criteria in&#xD;
        Table 1 below. The upper limit of normal is based upon each registering center's laboratory&#xD;
        normal ranges.&#xD;

        OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        Laboratory Test: Creatinine&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2.2.1&lt;TAB&gt;Patients with nonepithelial ovarian cancer, mixed epithelial/nonepithelial&#xD;
        ovarian cancer (i.e., Mixed Malignant Mullerian Tumors), or tumors of low malignant&#xD;
        potential. Patients with stage I or II epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary&#xD;
        peritoneal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2.2.2&lt;TAB&gt;Patients may not be receiving chemotherapy (therapeutic or consolidation),&#xD;
        maintenance, alternative therapy, or radiation therapy. No anti-cancer therapy of any kind&#xD;
        is allowed while the patient is on-study. Replacement hormonal therapy is allowed but must&#xD;
        be clearly indicated on the case report forms submitted. Hormonal anti-cancer therapies&#xD;
        such as tamoxifen and raloxifene will not be permitted while on study.&#xD;
&#xD;

        years prior to enrollment except for curatively treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix,&#xD;
        ductal or lobular carcinoma in situ of the breast, concomitant stage I endometrial cancer,&#xD;
        or basal or squamous cell skin cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2.2.5 &lt;TAB&gt;Complementary and alternative agent use is discouraged on this study due to the&#xD;
        possibility that the use of these agents may alter the serum protein pattern. The&#xD;
        Institutional Principal Investigator will have discretion as to whether complementary or&#xD;
        alternative agent usage will prevent eligibility on a case by case basis.&#xD;
