  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether infection with Helicobacter pylori bacteria may cause&#xD;
      inflammation of the eye's surface. Although most people who are infected with H. pylori do&#xD;
      not have symptoms, the bacteria can cause several diseases, including gastritis-stomach&#xD;
      inflammation, stomach ulcers or, rarely, stomach cancer, and certain types of lymphoma. H.&#xD;
      pylori has also been associated with autoimmune disorders, in which the patient's immune&#xD;
      system attacks the body's own tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People who have been infected with H. pylori, with and without dry eye, may be eligible for&#xD;
      this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, a blood test to determine H.&#xD;
      pylori infection, and an eye examination. The examination includes measurements of visual&#xD;
      acuity, eye pressure, and tear production. To measure the amount of tear production, a small&#xD;
      piece of filter paper is inserted over the eyelid on the side and collects tears over a&#xD;
      5-minute period. Drops of two colored dyes (orange and green) are placed in the eyes to see&#xD;
      if there are any dry areas. Screening also includes examination of the pupils and eye&#xD;
      movements, the lens, and the back of the eye, including the retina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also have a few cells collected from the surface of the eye. After the eyes&#xD;
      are numbed with anesthetic eye drops, a swab (like a Q-tip) is rolled over the surface of the&#xD;
      white part of the eye to collect small samples of the superficial layer of the conjunctiva -&#xD;
      a transparent membrane covering the eyeball. The specimens are analyzed by special laboratory&#xD;
      techniques to determine whether H. pylori has infected the eye.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Helicobacter pylori, one of the world's most prevalent pathogens, is a spiral-shaped,&#xD;
      catalase-positive, Gram-negative rod with 4-6 sheathed flagella attached to one pole which&#xD;
      allow for motility. The prevalence of H. pylori infection in humans is high; 50% of those&#xD;
      over the age of 60 are infected. H. pylori infection causes chronic gastric inflammation,&#xD;
      ulcer disease and gastric carcinoma. Further, chronic antigenic stimulation driven by H.&#xD;
      pylori infection has been linked to the development of gastric mucosa associated lymphoid&#xD;
      tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Infection with H. pylori induces a vigorous immune response resulting&#xD;
      in the presence of local and systemic antibodies. H. pylori-specific immunoglobulin G&#xD;
      antibodies present in serum, plasma, whole blood, saliva, gastric juice and urine have each&#xD;
      been used to successfully detect the presence of infection in adults. The sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of serological tests range from 80% to 95% depending upon the assay used. H.&#xD;
      Pylori infection is characteristically associated with a vigorous inflammatory response and&#xD;
      we have recently identified H. Pylori DNA in conjunctival MALT lymphoma using molecular&#xD;
      diagnostic techniques. Ocular surface inflammation is a cardinal feature of&#xD;
      keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Since we identified H. Pylori DNA in conjunctival MALT lymphoma&#xD;
      we hypothesize that chronic infection may also be capable of triggering chronic ocular&#xD;
      surface inflammation as seen in keratoconjunctivitis sicca. The purpose of this pilot study&#xD;
      is to determine whether H. pylori DNA is detectable in the conjunctiva of seropositive KCS&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
