      This study will examine the effects of morphine on leuteinizing hormone, testosterone,&#xD;
      adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol in men. The use of long-term opioids, such as&#xD;
      morphine, to treat patients with pain is increasing, despite a dearth of information about&#xD;
      their effects on hormones. The study will also look at the effect of chronic pain on these&#xD;
      hormone levels and the effect of placebo on pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men between 30 and 65 years of age who have had moderate to severe chronic pain due to&#xD;
      osteoarthritis for at least 3 months and healthy, pain-free men in the same age range may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Patients taking an opioid-based medication such as percocet,&#xD;
      vicodin, or morphine for pain relief, as well as patients who are not taking opioids, may&#xD;
      participate. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination, blood&#xD;
      tests, including a blood test to look for possible &quot;pain genes,&quot; electrocardiogram, x-ray,&#xD;
      and questionnaires that assess the impact of pain on functional level and psychological well&#xD;
      being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a four-part study. Healthy volunteers and patients who are taking opioids for their&#xD;
      arthritis pain end their participation after Part I; those who are not taking opioids&#xD;
      continue with Parts II, III, and IV, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I: Participants are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center at 4 p.m. for an overnight stay.&#xD;
      At 6 p.m. a catheter (plastic tube) is placed in a vein in the forearm and remains in place&#xD;
      throughout the night. Blood samples of 3 cc's each (less than a teaspoon) are collected&#xD;
      through the catheter every 20 minutes for 12 hours, from 8 p.m. until 8 a.m. Participants&#xD;
      also collect their urine starting from 8 a.m. on the morning of hospital admission and&#xD;
      continue the collection throughout their 24-hour hospital stay. Patients are discharged at&#xD;
      the completion of the blood sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II: Patients are randomly assigned to take morphine (MS Contin), placebo, or standard&#xD;
      treatment, which consists of anti-inflammatory medications and acetaminophen as needed, but&#xD;
      no opioids. (Patients in groups I and II are also permitted to take anti-inflammatory drugs&#xD;
      and acetominophen, in addition to their study medication.) Patients are monitored for drug&#xD;
      side effects by phone twice a week, and medication doses are adjusted as needed. The morphine&#xD;
      dose is gradually increased over a 4-week period if no side effects develop. After 2 weeks on&#xD;
      the highest dose of morphine, hormone blood levels are measured and patients complete&#xD;
      questionnaires. Patients are readmitted to the hospital for a repeat blood sampling and blood&#xD;
      collection as in Part I. Patients on morphine and placebo are then gradually tapered off drug&#xD;
      over 12 days and remain drug-free for 2 days before starting Part III.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part III: All patients are given morphine in this part of the study and are monitored for&#xD;
      drug side effects by phone twice a week, with doses adjusted as needed. The morphine is&#xD;
      gradually increased over a 6-week period if no side effects develop and is maintained at the&#xD;
      highest dose for another 8 weeks. Hormone levels are measured and the blood and urine studies&#xD;
      and questionnaires are repeated. Patients interested in continuing long-term treatment with&#xD;
      MC Contin are referred back to their physicians with recommendations to that effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part IV: Patients are followed by phone for 6 months, at which time they return to the&#xD;
      Clinical Center for hormone level measurements, repeat blood and urine tests, and&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;

      Several studies suggest that acceptance and use of opioid medicines for relief of chronic&#xD;
      pain are increasing substantially, and that opiodergic medications and chronic pain each&#xD;
      perturb neuroendocrine functions, especially those of the hypothalamic pituitary, adrenal,&#xD;
      and gonadal axes. The objectives of the proposed protocol, entitled &quot;Effects of Chronic&#xD;
      Musculoskeletal Pain and Opioidergic versus Placebo Interventions on Neuro-endocrine Function&#xD;
      in Men,&quot; are three fold:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether long term opioid usage in men with chronic pain due to&#xD;
           osteoarthritis results in abnormalities of ACTH, cortisol, LH and testosterone&#xD;
           secretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate whether placebo analgesia results in a similar hormonal response as elicited&#xD;
           by an opioid analgesic. Prior imaging studies have shown that placebo analgesia is&#xD;
           associated with activation of similar parts of the cortex as with analgesic intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the effects of chronic pain per se on ACTH, cortisol, LH and testosterone&#xD;
           secretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address these questions, we propose a 4-part study. In part I, 12 healthy men will be&#xD;
      compared with 12 men with chronic osteoarthritis (OA) pain on long term opioids and 12&#xD;
      narcotic naive men with chronic OA pain by means of 12 hour overnight frequent blood sampling&#xD;
      for measurement of cortisol, ACTH, LH and testosterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In part II, 36 narcotic naive patients with chronic OA, pain, all of whom will have undergone&#xD;
      overnight hormone sampling in Part I, will be randomized to one of three treatment groups: MS&#xD;
      Contin (15-90 mg), placebo and &quot;standard treatment.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doses of placebo and MS Contin will be escalated over 4 weeks in a similar fashion with&#xD;
      two-week maintenance and 2 week taper. At the end of maintenance at 6 weeks, all patients&#xD;
      will return for repeat 12 hour frequent sampling of the same hormones as in Part I. At the&#xD;
      end of part II, patients will be invited to go on to an open label treatment period with MS&#xD;
      Contin (15-120 mg) in part III of the study, which will consist of 6-week dose escalation and&#xD;
      8 weeks maintenance. At that point patients will be referred back to their physicians with&#xD;
      recommendations for continued treatment with MS Contin, if patients are interested in this&#xD;
      option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed by phone for 6 months. At that point they will be asked to return&#xD;
      to clinic for part IV, an outpatient AM sample of testosterone, LH, ACTH and cortisol. The&#xD;
      primary endpoints of this study will be measures of LH, testosterone, ACTH, and cortisol&#xD;
      secretion, whereas the secondary endpoints will be neurobehavioral indices such as pain and&#xD;
      bothersomeness on visual analog scales, the Oswestry Disability Index, Multidimensional Pain&#xD;
      Inventory, and the Beck Depression Inventory. It is anticipated that this study will provide&#xD;
      novel information regarding the effects of chronic musculoskeletal pain, and treatment with&#xD;
      opioids versus placebo, on selected neuroendocrine functions in men.&#xD;
