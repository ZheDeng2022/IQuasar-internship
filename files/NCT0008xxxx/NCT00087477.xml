  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will assess the safety and efficacy of Pivanex alone in patients with&#xD;
      malignant melanoma who have relapsed after treatment with chemotherapy or Interleukin-2&#xD;
      (IL-2). Pivanex is an investigational agent.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Pivanex is a histone deacetylase inhibitor that induces tumor differentiation,&#xD;
      inhibits proliferation, and induces apoptosis. Pivanex has been generally well tolerated in&#xD;
      clinical trials and has shown preliminary evidence of efficacy in patients with non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer. Pivanex has shown in-vitro and in-vivo evidence of anti-tumor activity&#xD;
      against melanoma and, therefore, represents a promising therapeutic approach to patients with&#xD;
      malignant melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: This open-label trial will determine the response rate of Pivanex in patients with&#xD;
      malignant melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine time to disease progression&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine overall survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the safety profile of Pivanex in malignant melanoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outline: This is an open-label, single center study in patients with malignant melanoma whose&#xD;
      disease has progressed or failed to respond to chemotherapy or Interleukin-2 (IL-2). Patients&#xD;
      will be treated with 2.5 g/m2 of Pivanex administered intravenously over 6 hours daily on&#xD;
      Days 1 - 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be repeated every 21 days until tumor progression or the patient is withdrawn&#xD;
      from treatment for other protocol-specified reasons. Tumor status will be assessed prior to&#xD;
      every odd-numbered treatment cycle using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
      (RECIST) method. Patients who continue to experience tumor response or stabilization at the&#xD;
      time treatment is discontinued will be followed every 12 weeks for tumor status until disease&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed melanoma, previously treated with&#xD;
             chemotherapy or IL-2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recurrent or progressive disease after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males and females, age ≥ 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate renal function with creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate liver function with alkaline phosphatase &lt;= 2.5 X upper limit of normal, SGOT&#xD;
             and SGPT &lt;= 1.5 X upper limit of normal and total bilirubin &lt;= 1.5 X upper limit of&#xD;
             normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate bone marrow function: platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3, hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL, and&#xD;
             absolute neutrophil count (ANC)≥ 1,500 cells/mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have discontinued previous surgery, radiation therapy or cancer chemotherapy at&#xD;
             least four weeks prior to randomization (six weeks if a prior nitrosourea or mitomycin&#xD;
             C), with recovery from treatment-associated toxicity. Localized palliative radiation&#xD;
             therapy to non-target lesions is permitted within the four weeks prior to&#xD;
             randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A predicted life expectancy of at least 6 months.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of more than three (3) systemic treatment regimens for malignant melanoma&#xD;
             (including IL-2).&#xD;
&#xD;
