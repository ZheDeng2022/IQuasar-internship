    <textblock>
      This is a 48-week study to compare TNX-355 plus OBT to placebo plus OBT in HIV subjects. You&#xD;
      must have a stable viral load of at least 10,000 copies/ml, been treated with highly active&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for at least 6 months, be triple class experienced, and&#xD;
      presently failing or have failed a HAART regimen. Subjects will receive infusions every week&#xD;
      for 8 weeks, then every two weeks.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This 48-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multi-dose,&#xD;
      three-arm safety and efficacy study of approximately 80 subjects will compare TNX-355 plus&#xD;
      OBT to placebo plus OBT in adult subjects infected with HIV-1. Subjects must: 1) have a&#xD;
      stable viral load of 10,000 copies/mL, determined within 8 weeks prior to randomization (Day&#xD;
      1); 2) have been treated with HAART for at least 6 months (cumulatively); 3) be triple class&#xD;
      experienced, with historical evidence of exposure to each of the three traditional classes of&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (ART): nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs),&#xD;
      non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), and protease inhibitors (PIs); and&#xD;
      4) be presently failing or have failed a HAART regimen within 8 weeks prior to screening&#xD;
      (Screening visit 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be assigned to OBT based upon their past medication history and the results of&#xD;
      the virus sensitivity testing (PSGT, ViroLogic, Inc.), and then randomized to a study arm to&#xD;
      begin receiving OBT plus study medication at the Day 1 visit. Fusion/entry inhibitors will&#xD;
      not be permitted as part of the optimized background therapy. All subjects will be randomized&#xD;
      equally (1:1:1 ratio), in a double-blinded fashion, among three arms to receive OBT plus one&#xD;
      of the following: Arm A, alternating intravenous infusions of TNX-355, 15 mg/kg and placebo&#xD;
      weekly for the first 9 doses (through the Week 8 visit), and then intravenous infusions of&#xD;
      TNX-355, 15 mg/kg every two weeks; Arm B, TNX-355, 10 mg/kg intravenous infusions weekly for&#xD;
      the first 9 doses (through the Week 8 visit), and then intravenous infusions of TNX-355, 10&#xD;
      mg/kg every two weeks; or Arm C, weekly intravenous infusions of placebo for the first 9&#xD;
      doses (through the Week 8 visit), and then intravenous infusions of placebo every two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will continue to receive blinded therapy until that therapy fails. Subjects that do&#xD;
      not achieve a viral load reduction of at least 0.5 log10 from their baseline value on two&#xD;
      consecutive protocol-defined assessments after Week 12 will be considered virologic failures.&#xD;
      Subjects that experience virologic failure after Week 16 (i.e., earliest point at which&#xD;
      virologic failure can be confirmed after Week 12) will have the option of being assigned to&#xD;
      new OBT plus open-label TNX-355 given as a 15 mg/kg infusion every two weeks. Subjects that&#xD;
      experience a second virologic failure will be discontinued from the study. The total duration&#xD;
      of study treatment will be 48 weeks, with the primary endpoint at Week 24.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must have all of the following to be included in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Triple-class experience, with no minimum exposure to any class (historical exposure to&#xD;
             NRTI, NNRTI, PI)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cumulative HAART experience for a minimum of 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Virus susceptibility to one or more antiretroviral drugs in their selected OBT as&#xD;
             determined by the PhenoSenseGT or similar assay and medication history&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stable plasma HIV-1 RNA levels quantitated by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain&#xD;
             reaction (RT-PCR) of 10,000 copies/mL within 8 weeks prior to randomization (Day 1),&#xD;
             while receiving a stable HAART regimen for a minimum of 4 weeks prior to screening.&#xD;
             Stable viral load is defined as a difference of 0.5-log10 in HIV-1 RNA copies/mL from&#xD;
             two measurements obtained at least 48 hours apart during the screening period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be failing their current HAART regimen or have discontinued a failing&#xD;
             HAART regimen within 8 weeks prior to screening (screening visit 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CD4+ cell count 50 cells/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If sexually active, willingness to use an effective, medically accepted (including&#xD;
             barrier) method of contraception during the study. To prevent superinfection, any male&#xD;
             subject and the male sexual partner of any study subject should use a condom. All&#xD;
             study subjects and all of their sexual partners should practice additional safe sex&#xD;
             techniques to prevent spread of HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with any of the following characteristics will be excluded from the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any significant diseases (other than HIV infection) or clinically significant&#xD;
             findings, including psychiatric and behavioral problems, medical history and/or&#xD;
             physical examination, determined from screening, that, in the investigator's opinion,&#xD;
             would preclude the subject from participating in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute illness within one week prior to administration of study drug (including&#xD;
             diarrhea and/or vomiting and fever and/or other signs and symptoms of infection such&#xD;
             as leukocytosis, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any active infection secondary to HIV, requiring acute therapy. However, subjects that&#xD;
             require maintenance therapy (i.e. secondary prophylaxis for opportunistic infections)&#xD;
             will be eligible for the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any immunomodulating therapy or systemic chemotherapy within 12 weeks prior to&#xD;
             randomization (Day 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any investigational drug use within 30 days prior to randomization (Day 1). This does&#xD;
             not include investigational drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 (NRTI, NNRTI or PI) under&#xD;
             expanded access. OBT may include drugs not currently approved, but prescribed under&#xD;
             expanded access (limited to NRTI's, NNRTI's and PI's).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any prior participation in an HIV vaccine study&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Vaccination within 21 days (3 weeks) prior to randomization (Day 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any previous exposure to any virus/fusion entry inhibitor/s&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any previous exposure to a monoclonal antibody (prior treatment with hepatitis B&#xD;
             immune globulin [HBIG] or intravenous immune globulin [IVIG] is acceptable)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of less than 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects who are either pregnant or breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any illicit intravenous drugs within 6 months prior to randomization (Day 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any current alcohol or illicit drug use that, in the investigator's opinion, will&#xD;
             interfere with the subject's ability to comply with the dosing schedule and protocol&#xD;
             evaluations&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant laboratory findings obtained during screening including:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine or BUN (&gt;1.5 X Upper Limit of Normal [ULN])&#xD;
