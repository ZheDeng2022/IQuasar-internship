  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, non-randomized, open label study of ILX651 in patients with&#xD;
      hormone-refractory prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel. Approximately 40&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled in this study that is expected to last 24 months. All patients will&#xD;
      be treated with ILX651 administered IV daily for 5 consecutive days every 21 days. The&#xD;
      primary objective of this study is to determine the PSA response rate. The secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to determine response of measurable disease, duration of response, time to PSA&#xD;
      progression, time to treatment failure, survival, safety and tolerability, and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic profile of ILX651.&#xD;

             or progression of measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has greater than 25% increase in 2 consecutive tests in which the first&#xD;
             increase in PSA should occur a minimum of 1 week apart.&#xD;
