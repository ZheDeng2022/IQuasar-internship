      This study will compare serotonin transporters in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder&#xD;
      (OCD) and healthy volunteers in order to better understand the role of serotonin in OCD.&#xD;
      Serotonin is a chemical in the brain that transmits nerve impulses. The serotonin transporter&#xD;
      (SERT) is a protein that regulates serotonin levels in the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal, healthy volunteers and patients with OCD between 18 and 50 years of age and in&#xD;
      overall good health may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical&#xD;
      history, physical examination, blood and urine tests, and a psychological interview and tests&#xD;
      related to OCD symptoms. Participants undergo the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning: For this test, subjects lie on the scanner&#xD;
           bed, wearing special masks that are fitted to their heads and attached to the beds to&#xD;
           help keep their heads still during the procedure. An 8-minute &quot;transmission&quot; scan is&#xD;
           done to provide measures of the brain that will help calculate information obtained from&#xD;
           subsequent scans. Then, a radioactive tracer is injected into a catheter (plastic tube)&#xD;
           placed in the arm. The scan produces images of the serotonin transporters in the brain.&#xD;
           Pictures are taken for about 2 hours, while the subject lies still on the scanner bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning: An MRI scan of the brain is done within 1&#xD;
           year of the PET scan-that is, up to 1 year before or 1 year after the PET scan. MRI uses&#xD;
           a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of body tissues and organs. For this&#xD;
           procedure, the patient lies on a table that is moved into the scanner (a narrow&#xD;
           cylinder), wearing earplugs to muffle loud knocking and thumping sounds that occur&#xD;
           during the scanning process. The procedure lasts about 1 hour, during which the patient&#xD;
           will be asked to lie still for up to a few minutes at a time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Genotyping: Subjects provide a blood sample (4 tablespoons) for DNA testing to look for&#xD;
           genes or gene regions that may contribute to serotonin activity. This may lead to a&#xD;
           better understanding of the genetic underpinnings of the serotonin system that influence&#xD;
           mood, movement, and addiction.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Evidence suggests that the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) arise from&#xD;
      dysfunction of both the serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems. These two&#xD;
      neurotransmitter systems are presumed to play a key modulatory role at the limbic-motor&#xD;
      interface of the fronto-subcortical circuitry. However, in vivo knowledge linking the&#xD;
      serotonergic and dopaminergic systems to OCD and OCD-related disorders is limited. In the&#xD;
      current protocol, we plan to use PET to image the serotonin transporter (SERT) within the new&#xD;
      radioligand [11C]DASB, in order to delineate regional abnormalities in SERT binding in&#xD;
      drug-naive or drug-free OCD patients in comparison to healthy volunteers. In addition, we&#xD;
      plan to examine the relationship between the regional PET measures of SERT and clinical&#xD;
      severity measures of OCD. The goal of the present study is, thus, to further our&#xD;
      understanding of the role of the serotonergic system in the pathophysiology of OCD.&#xD;
