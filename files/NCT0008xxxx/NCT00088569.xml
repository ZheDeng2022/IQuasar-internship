  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test a new electrical technique called direct current (DC) polarization that&#xD;
      is able to change brain activity in subtle ways for a short time. A recent study showed that,&#xD;
      depending on its direction, the current could make people perform a little better or perhaps&#xD;
      slightly worse on a test of the function of the brain's frontal lobe. This study will use&#xD;
      positron emission tomography (PET) scanning to examine how DC polarization affects brain&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers between 20 and 70 years of age who are right handed and who are not taking&#xD;
      any medications that affect the brain may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened&#xD;
      with a brief medical history and neurological evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants have a PET scan on three different days at least 3 days apart. Each scanning&#xD;
      session takes 2-1/2 to 3 hours. For the scan, radioactive water is injected into the body&#xD;
      through a vein. Subjects lie on a bed that slides in and out of the doughnut-shaped scanner,&#xD;
      with their head held from the back by a padded holder and in front by a custom-molded plastic&#xD;
      mask with holes for the eyes, nose, and mouth. DC electrodes made of wet sponges are placed&#xD;
      on the right side of the head and over the left eye and are held in place with elastic&#xD;
      bandages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three kinds of DC polarization are tested. In two tests the current is the same, but in&#xD;
      opposite directions. The third is a sham (placebo) condition with no current delivered. Each&#xD;
      of the three scans is separated by at least 3 days. On each day, a series of scans is done in&#xD;
      a single session. Before each injection of tracer, the DC current is turned on. This may&#xD;
      cause a tingling or slight burning on the skin under the electrodes, which disappears when&#xD;
      the current is turned off. In each session, the subject receives 16 injections of tracer&#xD;
      about 8 minutes apart, with DC polarization turned on for 4 out of the 8 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During most of the 8-minute periods, subjects are shown a pattern of dots about every 2&#xD;
      seconds. Sometimes the subject just looks at the patterns, and sometimes subjects are asked&#xD;
      to push a button corresponding to the pattern they saw just before the current one. Sometimes&#xD;
      they will be asked to push a button corresponding to the pattern that came before that one&#xD;
      and so on, up to three patterns before the current one. The task lasts for about 2 minutes&#xD;
      each time, with time to relax in between.&#xD;

      Objective: The passage of weak DC currents across the head (DC polarization) is a safe and&#xD;
      painless means of altering the activity of cortical neurons and their response to exogenous&#xD;
      stimulation. This has been demonstrated in the human motor cortex where local anodal&#xD;
      polarization increases, and cathodal decreases, the motor evoked potential from TMS. Recent&#xD;
      experiments from our lab suggest that polarization may have analogous effects on the&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex, where anodal current enhances functions including verbal fluency and&#xD;
      psychomotor speed and cathodal current produces slight performance decrements. We are&#xD;
      interested in the potential of DC current to enhance function in patients with frontal lobe&#xD;
      disorders and to reduce frontal overactivation in conditions such as drug craving. Treatments&#xD;
      that alter frontal activity may also have mood altering properties. In order to establish the&#xD;
      principle that DC polarization is able to alter frontal lobe activity we propose to combine&#xD;
      DC polarization with a variably loaded frontal activation task and measure regional cerebral&#xD;
      blood flow (rCBF with H(2)(15)O positron emission tomography (PET) scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Twenty healthy individuals will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: On three different days, participants will receive right dorsolateral prefrontal&#xD;
      anodal, cathodal, or sham treatment. On each day, rCBF will be measured during rest without&#xD;
      and then with treatment. Then subjects will perform the N-back task (a test of working&#xD;
      memory) during treatment with the working memory load (N) varied between 0 and 3 items from&#xD;
      scan to scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: Resting rCBF and the relationship between cognitive load and rCBF at the&#xD;
      treatment site will be compared between treatments in order to look for effects on&#xD;
      task-related activation and performance.&#xD;
