  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for patients who have Stage IIIb or Stage IV NSCLC and have never had&#xD;
      chemotherapy before for their disease. The first phase of the study recently completed and&#xD;
      for the second phase of the study patients are randomly assigned to receive either paclitaxel&#xD;
      and carboplatin or paclitaxel and carboplatin and study drug (STA 4783). Treatment will be&#xD;
      every 3 weeks for 6 cycles.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically and/or cytologically proven NSCLC (mixed forms with small cell lung&#xD;
             cancer are excluded) with clinically stage IIIB or stage IV disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior systemic chemotherapy treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatments with radiotherapy or local ablative therapies are allowed if these&#xD;
             therapies do not affect the measurable target lesions being used for the purposes of&#xD;
             this protocol. Completion of any radiotherapy must be greater than or equal to 4 weeks&#xD;
             prior to study entry, and/or resolution of all acute toxic effects of any prior&#xD;
             radiotherapy or major surgical procedure to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common&#xD;
             Toxicity Criteria (CTC) grade less than or equal to 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of unidimensionally measurable disease (ie, greater than or equal to 1&#xD;
             malignant tumor mass that may be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension greater&#xD;
             than or equal to 20 mm with conventional radiographic techniques or magnetic resonance&#xD;
             imaging [MRI], or greater than or equal to 10 mm with spiral computerized tomography&#xD;
             [CT] scan). Tumor evaluation by positron emission tomography (PET) scan or by&#xD;
             ultrasound may not substitute for CT or MRI scans. Bone lesions, ascites, peritoneal&#xD;
             carcinomatosis or miliary lesions, pleural or pericardial effusions, lymphangitis of&#xD;
             the skin or lung, cystic lesions, or irradiated lesions, and disease documented by&#xD;
             indirect evidence only (eg, by laboratory tests such as alkaline phosphatase) are not&#xD;
             considered measurable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female or male, 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neuropathy of Grade 0 or Grade 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate organ function as defined by the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST; serum glutamate-oxalate transferase&#xD;
                  [SGOT]) and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT; serum glutamate-pyruvate&#xD;
                  transferase) [SGPT] less than or equal to 2.5 x central laboratory upper limit of&#xD;
                  normal (ULN). If liver function abnormalities are due to underlying malignancy,&#xD;
                  then AST and ALT may be less than or equal to 5 x ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total serum bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) less than or equal to&#xD;
                  1.5x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1500/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9.0 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of STA-4783 on the developing human fetus are unknown, however, taxanes&#xD;
             and platinum analogues are known to be teratogenic. Therefore, women of childbearing&#xD;
             potential (defined as, unless surgically sterile, women &lt;=50 years of age or history&#xD;
             of amenorrhea for &lt; 12 months prior to study entry) must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
             entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a female patient become&#xD;
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must agree&#xD;
             to inform the treating physician immediately, and be followed until delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed and dated informed consent document indicating that the patient (or legally&#xD;
             acceptable representative) has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the trial&#xD;
             prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory&#xD;
             tests, and other study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with large untreated pleural effusions, or who have immediate&#xD;
             life-threatening complications of their disease, or those who may need urgent&#xD;
             radiotherapy (e.g., due to lobar obstruction, painful bony sites, cord compression, or&#xD;
             superior vena cava syndrome).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current participation in another clinical drug trial; may not be receiving an&#xD;
             investigational drug or any other agent that has an immunomodulatory or presumed&#xD;
             anti-tumor effect within 4 weeks of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known brain metastases, or leptomeningeal disease on screening CT or MRI scan, except&#xD;
             for treated disease that is considered clinically and radiologically stable, and does&#xD;
             not require treatment with anti-convulsants and/or steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior malignancy other than NSCLC within the last 5 years with the exception of:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adequately treated in situ carcinoma of the cervix uteri;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Previous nonpulmonary malignancy confined and surgically resected with no&#xD;
                  evidence of active malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known allergy to Cremophor® or Cremophor®-based drug products.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome&#xD;
             (AIDS)-related illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other medications, or severe acute/chronic medical or psychiatric condition, or&#xD;
             laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation&#xD;
             or study drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study&#xD;
             results, and in the judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate&#xD;
             for entry into this study.&#xD;
