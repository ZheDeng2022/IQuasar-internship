  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial is studying how well cilengitide works in treating patients&#xD;
      with unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma. Cilengitide may stop the growth of melanoma&#xD;
      by stopping blood flow to the tumor.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the clinical efficacy of EMD 121974 at two different doses in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic melanoma by determining the progression-free survival rate at 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the response rate of EMD 121974 in patients with metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the overall survival in patients who receive EMD 121974. III. To determine&#xD;
      the safety and toxicity of EMD 121974 in patients with metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the population pharmacokinetics of EMD 121974. V. To determine the&#xD;
      biological activity of EMD 121974 in melanoma cells of patients who are treated with the&#xD;
      drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To evaluate the use of optical imaging and functional dynamic imaging scans in assessing&#xD;
      biological activity of EMD 121974.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. Patients are stratified according to prior&#xD;
      systemic treatment (yes vs no), visceral metastases (yes vs no), serum lactic dehydrogenase&#xD;
      level (normal vs abnormal), and tumor integrin α_vβ_3 overexpression (yes vs no). Patients&#xD;
      are randomized into 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive cilengitide IV over 1 hour on days 1, 4, 8, 11*, 15, 18, 22, and 25.&#xD;
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: *For the first course only, treatment is omitted on day 11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive cilengitide as in arm I at a higher dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then&#xD;
      every 6 months thereafter.&#xD;

             stage III metastatic melanoma of cutaneous, mucosal or unknown origin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be&#xD;
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;=&#xD;
             15 mm with conventional techniques or with spiral CT scan; in case of obviously&#xD;
             visible cutaneous metastatic lesions, the margins of the lesions should be clearly&#xD;
             defined and measured in at least one dimension as &gt;= 10 mm&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient may have received prior interferon therapy (only in an adjuvant setting for&#xD;
             resected stage III melanoma) and/or up to 1 prior systemic treatment regimen&#xD;
             (chemotherapy, biotherapy, or biochemotherapy) for stage IV disease; active vaccine&#xD;
             therapy will not be considered as &quot;prior systemic treatment&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiographic studies used to assess disease must have been performed within 21 days&#xD;
             prior to registration; if a target lesion has been previously embolized, perfused or&#xD;
             irradiated, there must be objective evidence of progression before start of therapy to&#xD;
             be considered for response assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 2 (or Karnofsky ≥ 60%)&#xD;

          -  Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/microL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/microL&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Creatinine =&lt; 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have a hemoglobin &gt;= 9 gm/dL (this may be achieved by transfusion if&#xD;
             needed) obtained within 14 days prior to registration; in case that PRBC transfusion&#xD;
             is needed to obtain a hemoglobin level of &gt;= 9 gm/dL, the hemoglobin level should not&#xD;
             be reduced more than 1 gm/dL for at least 1 week&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of EMD 121974 on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic&#xD;
             dose are unknown; for this reason and because antiangiogenic agents are known to be&#xD;
             teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
             entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
             suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her&#xD;
             treating physician immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with metastatic melanoma of choroidal origin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have received the following drugs prior to enrollment: endostatin,&#xD;
             angiostatin, bevacizumab or any integrin-targeted drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who require concurrent treatment with a non-permitted medication (such as&#xD;
             anticoagulant therapy other than for flushing of intravenous port device, or used for&#xD;
             thrombosis prophylaxis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not&#xD;
             recovered to grade 1 toxicity from adverse events due to agents administered more than&#xD;
             4 weeks earlier&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events;&#xD;
             however, the following is the exception; patients who have no radiographical evidence&#xD;
             of recurrences in the brain for at least 3 months after the complete resection of the&#xD;
             brain metastases or who have asymptomatic brain metastases stable for at least 3&#xD;
             months since the whole brain radiation therapy and/or stereotactic radiosurgery will&#xD;
             be eligible for this study; patients must not require a steroid treatment for brain&#xD;
             metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of wound-healing disorders, advanced coronary disease (such as&#xD;
             unstable angina pectoris or arrhythmia LOWN IV [defined as 2 or more consecutive&#xD;
             ventricular premature complexes], cardiac or cardiovascular abnormalities NYHA&#xD;
             III/IV), or with a recent history (within 6 months) of peptic ulcer disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because EMD 121974 is an antiangiogenic&#xD;
             agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with EMD 121974, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with EMD 121974; lactating women must not breastfeed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated&#xD;
             basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated&#xD;
             Stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in complete remission, or any&#xD;
             other cancer from which the patient has been disease-free for 5 years&#xD;
