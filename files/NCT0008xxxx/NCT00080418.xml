      The purpose of this study is to determine the highest dose of Liposome Entrapped Paclitaxel&#xD;
      Easy to Use formulation (LEP-ETU) that can be safely administered by an intravenous infusion&#xD;
      to patients with advanced cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      LEP-ETU is a new formulation of the anti-cancer agent paclitaxel for injection or Taxol&#xD;
      (paclitaxel and Cremophor EL). Paclitaxel is a drug currently used for treating a broad range&#xD;
      of cancers. Paclitaxel is thought to prevent cells from dividing and growing, resulting in&#xD;
      cell death. This new formulation consists of paclitaxel associated with liposomes, which are&#xD;
      microscopic membrane-like structures created from lipids (fats). It is believed that LEP-ETU&#xD;
      will maintain or enhance the anti-tumor properties of paclitaxel, while offering advantages&#xD;
      to the patient of a shorter infusion time, routine premedication not required, fewer side&#xD;
      effects at similar doses, and possibly greater effectiveness, especially if higher doses can&#xD;
      be delivered without an increase in side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to determine the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The highest dose of LEP-ETU that can be given safely to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel following intravenous infusion with LEP-ETU.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any anti-tumor effects of LEP-ETU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 8 dose levels will be studied. LEP-ETU will be given to patients by intravenous&#xD;
      infusion over 90 minutes, once every 21 days, until their disease progresses or side effects&#xD;
      occur requiring the treatments to end. Patients will be evaluated for safety and how well&#xD;
      they tolerate the treatments.&#xD;
