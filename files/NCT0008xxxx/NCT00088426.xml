    <textblock>
      This study will examine how holoprosencephaly (HPE) affects people, how they change over&#xD;
      time, and what genes may be involved in the cause of the disorder. HPE is a defect of brain&#xD;
      development in utero in which the forebrain fails to sufficiently divide into two&#xD;
      hemispheres, resulting in a single-lobed brain and skull and facial malformations. In most&#xD;
      cases, the defects are so severe that babies die before birth. There are three&#xD;
      classifications of HPE. In alobar HPE the brain does not divide at all; this form is usually&#xD;
      associated with severe facial deformities. In semilobar HPE the hemispheres divide somewhat,&#xD;
      causing an intermediate form of the disorder. In lobar HPE, the mildest form, separation of&#xD;
      hemispheres is nearly normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with HPE and their direct blood relatives may participate in this study. Patients&#xD;
      are seen by a team of medical specialists at the NIH Clinical Center for the following&#xD;
      procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical and neurological examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imaging studies, such as echocardiogram, abdominal ultrasound, brain MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electroencephalogram (EEG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hearing evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine samples for genetic and endocrine studies, routine blood chemistries,&#xD;
           urinalysis, and urine electrolytes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other consultations as needed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Possibly photographs, including front and side views of the face and other body parts&#xD;
           that may be involved in HPE, such as the eyes, teeth, hands, and feet&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents will be asked questions about the child's prenatal, birth, newborn, and past medical&#xD;
      history, growth, behavior and development, and therapy and medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because HPE is a genetic disorder and gene changes can be passed on in a family, parents will&#xD;
      also be asked to undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completion of a medical and family history form&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical and neurological examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine samples (for mothers only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specialty consultations as indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Possibly photographs, including front and side views of the face and other body parts&#xD;
           that may be involved in HPE, such as the eyes, teeth, hands, and feet&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychosocial study. Some parents will be asked to participate in a telephone interview&#xD;
           or complete a questionnaire, or both, about their attitudes, beliefs, and concerns about&#xD;
           how they and their family cope with their child's condition. Some questionnaires may&#xD;
           include questions about aspects of their marriage and personal feelings and experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents will meet with a doctor and a genetics nurse to discuss the results of the tests and&#xD;
      answer questions. Parents may be asked to bring their child back to the NIH after 2 years for&#xD;
      follow-up examination and possible additional or repeat testing.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is a defect of midline forebrain development that occurs soon after&#xD;
      conception. It has a prevalence of 1 in 250 during early embryonic development, and 1 in&#xD;
      10,000 to 1 in 20,000 at term. In live born infants, the abnormalities associated with HPE&#xD;
      are divided into three main categories: alobar, semilobar, and lobar HPE. A fourth variant,&#xD;
      middle interhemispheric variant, has also been recognized. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      increase our understanding of the genetic and clinical manifestations of HPE through detailed&#xD;
      physical, psychological, developmental, neurologic, endocrinologic, and radiologic studies.&#xD;
      We will examine the spectrum of clinical characteristics of HPE to facilitate early diagnosis&#xD;
      and clinical management, including genetic counseling. Finally, we plan to assess the&#xD;
      psychosocial impact of HPE on the family as a unit. Most patients and their families will be&#xD;
      seen at the NIH Clinical Center. A subset may be examined outside the NIH, and a further&#xD;
      subset, for the psychosocial studies, may be interviewed by phone.&#xD;

        Patients with known or suspected holoprosencephaly (HPE). To conserve resources and meet&#xD;
        study objectives, subjects with known mutations will be given priority in selection for&#xD;
        extensive clinical studies. Direct blood relatives (typically parents, and occasionally&#xD;
        siblings of affected individuals) of patients with HPE are also eligible to participate.@@@&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Depending on their willingness to participate, subjects may enroll in DNA&#xD;
                  laboratory-only (98-HG-0249), psychosocial-only, or clinical-only. However, to&#xD;
                  conserve resources and meet study objectives, subjects with known mutations will&#xD;
                  be given priority in selection for extensive clinical studies. All races and&#xD;
                  genders are known to be at risk for HPE, anywhere in the world. Nationality or&#xD;
                  place of origin is not specific barrier to participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Direct blood relatives (typically parents, and occasionally siblings of affected&#xD;
                  individuals) of patients with HPE are also eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Anyone unwilling to provide informed consent (for themselves as adults, or on behalf&#xD;
             of their children as minors) or assent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Medical condition(s) or mental retardation are not in themselves reason for exclusion&#xD;
             if in the judgment of the referring physician this would involve no more than minimal&#xD;
             risk. We anticipate that children with mental handicaps would be included in the&#xD;
             research population. We will make every effort to explain the study for the purpose of&#xD;
             assent in a manner that the family feels is both age and developmentally appropriate&#xD;
             for that child.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. We generally review a brief clinical description from the referring physician about a&#xD;
             potential research subject to determine that the subject is appropriate to enter into&#xD;
             the study. We reserve the right to exclude cases that are clearly not HPE or related&#xD;
             to our direct research interests (e.g. HPE cases that are syndromic like Smith Lemli&#xD;
             Opitz syndrome, Trisomy 13, Trisomy 18, drug-related, or teratogen-related). This&#xD;
             almost never happens, and we would attempt to make referrals to a more appropriate&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        It is our intention to try to remove as many economic, cultural, geographic, racial, and&#xD;
        gender barriers as we reasonably can to promote participation of HPE cases for research&#xD;
        purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Description and justification of clinical inclusion/exclusion criteria for environmental&#xD;
        study arm control group (individuals with Williams syndrome) :&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants must have a confirmed diagnosis of Williams syndrome caused by deletions in&#xD;
        chromosome 7q11 involving the Williams-Beuren Syndrome Critical Region (WBSCR). Children&#xD;
        should be less than 6 years of age to allow for improved maternal recall of prenatal&#xD;
&#xD;
        environmental exposures. The Williams syndrome cohort (PI: Dr. Beth Kozel; National Heart&#xD;
        Lung Blood Institute) was chosen to allow for inherent biases in mothers who have children&#xD;
        with multiple anomaly syndromes.&#xD;
