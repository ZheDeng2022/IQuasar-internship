      This pilot study will assess the safety and efficacy of Pivanex alone in patients with&#xD;
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who have relapsed or refractory disease after previous&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatment. Pivanex is an investigational agent.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a disease characterized by the accumulation&#xD;
      of mature lymphocytes. These CLL lymphocytes are blocked from undergoing terminal&#xD;
      differentiation and apoptosis. Patients with CLL have limited options for therapy, especially&#xD;
      after the failure of standard chemotherapy regimens. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACs)&#xD;
      comprise a new class of drugs being evaluated in the treatment of various malignancies. In&#xD;
      vitro data suggest that HDAC inhibition leads to terminal B-cell differentiation and may&#xD;
      therefore play a therapeutic role in the treatment of CLL. Pivanex (pivaloyloxymethyl&#xD;
      butyrate) is an HDAC inhibitor that has been shown to induce apoptosis of CLL lymphocytes in&#xD;
      vitro. In previous clinical trials, Pivanex has been well tolerated. The goal of this&#xD;
      protocol is to determine the effects of Pivanex in patients with CLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: This open-label trial will determine the response rate of Pivanex in patients with&#xD;
      CLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: (1) Determine the response rate of Pivanex in patients with relapsed CLL; (2)&#xD;
      Determine time to disease progression in patients with relapsed CLL treated with Pivanex; and&#xD;
      (3) Determine the safety profile of Pivanex in CLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is an open label, single arm, multiple dose, pilot study of patients with&#xD;
      relapsed CLL. Patients will be treated with 2.5 g/m2 of Pivanex administered intravenously&#xD;
      over 6 hours daily on Days 1 - 3. Treatment will be repeated every 21 days until disease&#xD;
      progression or the patient is withdrawn from treatment for protocol-specified reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease status will be assessed prior to every odd-numbered treatment cycle using response&#xD;
      criteria based upon the Revised National Cancer Institute-sponsored Working Group Guidelines&#xD;
      for CLL. Patients withdrawn due to disease progression will be followed for survival.&#xD;
      Patients withdrawn from study for reasons other than disease progression will be followed for&#xD;
      disease progression and survival.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a confirmed diagnosis of CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL)&#xD;
             based upon the Revised NCI-sponsored Working Group guidelines for CLL;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Relapsed or refractory disease after previous chemotherapy treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 18 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate renal function with creatinine &lt;= 1.5 mg/dL;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate liver function with alkaline phosphatase &lt;= 2.5 X upper limit of normal,&#xD;
             serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), and serum glutamic pyruvic&#xD;
             transaminase (SGPT) &lt;= 2.5 X upper limit of normal; and total bilirubin &lt;= 2.0 X upper&#xD;
             limit of normal;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate bone marrow function as determined by having platelets &gt; 50,000/mm3 without&#xD;
             transfusion in the preceding 2 weeks and an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) =&gt; 1,500&#xD;
             cells/mm3 without growth factor support; unless cytopenias due to marrow infiltration;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to give informed consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A minimum of 4 weeks must have elapsed from the completion of any previous treatment&#xD;
             regimen, including radiation and biologic therapies (6 weeks if a prior nitrosourea or&#xD;
             mitomycin C, 12 weeks if radioimmunotherapy) to treatment on Day 1 Cycle 1. Patients&#xD;
             must have recovery from treatment-associated toxicity(ies);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A predicted life expectancy of at least 6 months; and&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  More than three systemic treatment regimens for CLL/SLL (excluding immunotherapies and&#xD;
             biologic therapies);&#xD;
&#xD;
