      This study will compare serotonin transporter proteins in people with alcoholism and healthy&#xD;
      volunteers to examine how these proteins may be related to the inability of people with&#xD;
      alcoholism to appropriately regulate their alcohol consumption. Serotonin transporters&#xD;
      regulate levels of the brain chemical serotonin. Problems in this regulation have been&#xD;
      implicated in alcoholism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers and people who suffer from alcoholism who are between 18 and 75&#xD;
      years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history&#xD;
      and physical examination, psychiatric diagnostic interview, blood and urine tests, an&#xD;
      electrocardiogram, urine toxicology screen, and written psychological evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      scanning to measure serotonin transporter levels in the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET uses small amounts of a radioactive chemical called a tracer that &quot;labels&quot; the serotonin&#xD;
      transporters in the brain. The tracer used in this study is [11C]DASB. For the procedure, the&#xD;
      subject lies on the scanner bed. A special mask is fitted to the head and attached to the bed&#xD;
      to help keep the subject's head still during the scan so the images will be clear. A brief&#xD;
      scan is done just before the radioactive tracer is injected. This scan provides measures of&#xD;
      the brain that will help in the precise calculation of information from subsequent scans.&#xD;
      After the tracer is injected through a catheter (plastic tube) placed in the arm, pictures&#xD;
      are taken for about 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce pictures of brain structure. The subject&#xD;
      lies on a bed that slides into the tube-like scanner, wearing earplugs to muffle loud noises&#xD;
      the machine makes when the magnetic fields are switched. The scan takes about an hour, during&#xD;
      which time the subject can communicate with the technician.&#xD;

      Alcoholism is characterized by the inability of individuals to regulate their consumption of&#xD;
      alcohol appropriately. Serotonergic dysfunction has been implicated in the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      this illness. Serotonin transporters (SERT) critically regulate the tone of serotonergic&#xD;
      transmission (Gobbi et al 2001). In a brain imaging study using the SPECT radioligand, [123I]&#xD;
      Beta-CIT, male alcoholics who had abstained from alcohol for more than four weeks, had&#xD;
      significantly reduced serotonin transporters in the raphe area of the brainstem compared to&#xD;
      healthy control subjects (Heinz et al 1998). However, the [123I] Beta-CIT ligand, binds with&#xD;
      high affinity to both the dopamine transporter (DAT) and SERT. Binding of [123I] Beta-CIT in&#xD;
      regions rich in SERT or DAT have been attributed to SERT and DAT respectively but in regions&#xD;
      of mixed innervation (e.g. cortical regions), it is not possible to distinguish between SERT&#xD;
      and DAT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [11C]DASB is a PET ligand with high affinity for SERT with almost 1,000 fold selectivity&#xD;
      versus DAT. Using this tracer, we will be able to measure SERT binding in cortical and&#xD;
      subcortical brain regions including those with mixed innervation. [11C] DASB PET studies in&#xD;
      humans (Houle et al 2000; Meyer et al 2001) indicate the feasibility of quantifying SERT&#xD;
      binding in SERT rich regions. In the current protocol, we plan to use PET imaging with the&#xD;
      radioligand, [11C] DASB, for serotonin transporter (SERT) to delineate regional abnormalities&#xD;
      in SERT binding in two subject groups consisting of 30 patients with alcoholism and 30&#xD;
      healthy volunteers. Our goal of the present study is to further our understanding of the&#xD;
      roles of the serotonergic systems in the pathophysiology of alcoholism.&#xD;

        -  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Alcoholic and healthy subjects will be recruited from those screened by Dr. Daniel Hommer&#xD;
        using either protocol (Protocol number 98-AA-0009) which is used to identify and recruit&#xD;
        adult participants who meet DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence, alcohol abuse and&#xD;
        healthy controls or protocol (Protocol number 05-AA-0121) assessment and treatment of&#xD;
        people with alcohol drinking problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        As stated in protocol 98-AA-0009, subjects will be recruited primarily from the Washington,&#xD;
        DC metropolitan area through newspaper advertisements. These have been approved by the&#xD;
        NIAAA IRB in the past and have not changed. As necessary these advertisements which are now&#xD;
        primarily published in the Washington Post Health Section, will be reviewed and revised.&#xD;
        Any revisions will be presented to the IRB. Subjects will also be recruited through&#xD;
        outreach to health care professionals and treatment facilities throughout Northern&#xD;
        Virginia, West Virginia and the Washington, DC and Baltimore metropolitan areas. Patient&#xD;
        referrals for sources throughout the U.S. and on occasion international referrals also will&#xD;
        be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Increased efforts will be made to recruit alcoholic subjects from the Hispanic community.&#xD;
        This will take the form of contacts with treatment programs that serve Hispanic&#xD;
        populations, as well as through advertising in Spanish language newspapers. We have decided&#xD;
        to exclude children from this protocol because the NIH Clinical Center currently does not&#xD;
        have any inpatient units capable of treating substance abusing patients who are under the&#xD;
        age of 18. Every effort will be made to recruit a similar number of age-matched males and&#xD;
        females. The two groups will not be individually matched by age. For example, we will not&#xD;
        seek a control subject to match a particular alcoholic patient's age. Instead the two&#xD;
        groups will be matched for mean age. We will obtain informed consent from all subjects per&#xD;
        NIH guidelines for research studies.&#xD;
