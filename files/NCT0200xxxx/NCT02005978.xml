  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acromegaly is caused by increased production of growth hormone (GH) from a usually benign&#xD;
      pituitary tumor. The disease causes a number of complications including disturbances in&#xD;
      glucose metabolism and about 25% of the patients develop diabetes. Most patients are cured&#xD;
      upon surgery alone, but many require additional medical treatment, and in rare cases&#xD;
      radiotherapy. A disadvantage of radiotherapy is a risk of radiation damage to nearby areas&#xD;
      such as the hypothalamus. The true extent of irradiation induced hypothalamic dysfunction,&#xD;
      however, remains uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data have shown significant improvement and often normalization of glucose metabolism upon&#xD;
      surgical cure from acromegaly, whereas data suggest that such improvement is less likely in&#xD;
      patients receiving additional radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothalamus is part of the so-called 'gut-brain axis', where gastrointestinal hormones&#xD;
      through interaction with the hypothalamus plays a significant role in the regulation of&#xD;
      appetite and glucose metabolism. Incretins are the most prominent gastrointestinal hormones&#xD;
      involved, with the incretin-effect referring to food-induced insulin secretion, which in&#xD;
      healthy subjects is responsible for up to 70% of the insulin response after oral glucose&#xD;
      intake. The investigators hypothesize that radiation conditional influence of the&#xD;
      hypothalamus may compromise the gut-brain activity and thereby affect the incretin-effect and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal-mediated glucose disposal (GIGD; i.e. sum of all gastrointestinal-derived&#xD;
      factors that contribute to glucose metabolism) in patients with acromegaly. The aim of the&#xD;
      study is to investigate the long term effect of surgery with or without additional&#xD;
      fractionated radiation therapy on glucose metabolism as assessed by incretin-effect and GIGD&#xD;
      in acromegaly, in order to identify possible associations with treatment modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population include 24 acromegalic patients who have previously received (N=12) or&#xD;
      did not receive (N=12) pituitary irradiation as part of their treatment, and 12 matched&#xD;
      healthy controls.&#xD;
