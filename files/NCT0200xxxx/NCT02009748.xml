    <textblock>
      Previous studies suggested that vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in cirrhotic&#xD;
      patients and is related to the degree of liver dysfunction as well as mortality. In&#xD;
      gastrointestinal disorders, vitamin D absorption can be highly reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We herein aim to investigate the efficacy of oral vitamin D supplementation in cirrhotic&#xD;
      patients with vitamin D insufficiency.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cirrhosis of the liver is a slowly progressive disease with a high number of complications&#xD;
      like hepatic encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding, ascites, renal failure and&#xD;
      hepatocellular cancer leading to death. Cirrhosis as a cause of death has increased&#xD;
      progressively in the mortality data for the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This terminal liver disease as a complication of chronic viral hepatitis, alcoholism and&#xD;
      metabolic disorders, with genetic and non-genetic predisposition, may be linked to&#xD;
      nutritional aberration as a precursor to or an effect of the illness. Previous studies&#xD;
      suggested that chronic liver diseases may be related to high prevalence of vitamin D&#xD;
      deficiency and in gastrointestinal disorders the vitamin D absorption can be highly reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with cirrhosis are often presented with malnutrition and one of the limiting factors&#xD;
      of the intestinal malabsorption is the portal hypertension due to the liver disease. Beside&#xD;
      nutrition the main source of vitamin D is sunlight and ultraviolet-B inducing the conversion&#xD;
      of 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D in the skin; therefore limited sunlight exposure of the&#xD;
      skin may lead to an inadequate vitamin D status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D itself is biologically inactive and has to be hydroxylated in the liver to&#xD;
      25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) as the main circulating metabolite used for classification of&#xD;
      the vitamin D status. 1,25 hydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)D) is produced through conversion by the&#xD;
      enzyme 1-alpha-hydroxylase in the kidney. This vitamin D metabolite shows a higher affinity&#xD;
      for the vitamin D receptor (VDR) compared to 25(OH)D. After binding and activation of the VDR&#xD;
      three percent of the human genome will be regulated. Among the main role of vitamin D&#xD;
      metabolites to regulate calcium and bone homeostasis, they also show non-skeletal effects&#xD;
      with relevance in the development of several chronic diseases. In this context, vitamin D&#xD;
      deficiency has been associated with an increased risk of cancer , cardiovascular, autoimmune,&#xD;
      and infectious diseases, Based on these findings, a significantly reduced risk of mortality&#xD;
      was shown in patients with oral vitamin D supplementation in randomized controlled studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our previously published study presented a prospective association of vitamin D levels with&#xD;
      occurrence of hepatic decompensation. Furthermore vitamin D deficiency was associated with&#xD;
      high mortality in cirrhotic patients dependent on liver dysfunction. Concerning this aspect&#xD;
      the main point is to investigate in this study whether low vitamin D status is the&#xD;
      consequence of increasing deterioration of the liver synthesis or may even contribute to&#xD;
      liver dysfunction. Low synthesis of vitamin D in the skin can be the result of reduced&#xD;
      sunlight exposure and malnutrition and/or malabsorption in cirrhotic patients. On the other&#xD;
      hand, organ dysfunction may impair the activity of 25-hydroxylase in the liver. Despite the&#xD;
      above mentioned correlation between vitamin D deficiency and liver dysfunction there is still&#xD;
      insufficient evidence to recommend oral vitamin D supplementation as a concomitant therapy in&#xD;
      clinical practice because there exists no adequately designed randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      that evaluates the necessary daily oral dose on vitamin D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to address this issue in the present study so that the findings of our study will lead&#xD;
      to implementation of treatment strategies for maintaining a sufficient vitamin D status in&#xD;
      cirrhotic patients.&#xD;
