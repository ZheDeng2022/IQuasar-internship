    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of azacitidine in treating&#xD;
      patients with lung cancer that is stage IV or has returned after previous treatments&#xD;
      (recurrent). Azacitidine is a drug used in chemotherapy that may stop tumor cells from&#xD;
      growing or spreading by activating genes that help prevent cancer growth, called tumor&#xD;
      suppressor genes. As people age, these genes are silenced by a chemical reaction that occurs&#xD;
      naturally in the body, or by exposure to environmental factors such as smoking. Azacitidine&#xD;
      may help reverse this process and restore the function of the tumor suppressor genes.&#xD;
      Delivering azacitidine directly into the lungs by inhalation may work better in treating lung&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and toxicity of inhaled Vidaza®&#xD;
      (azacitidine) with special emphasis on pulmonary toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of inhaled Vidaza®. II. To determine the changes in&#xD;
      global methylation patterns in the bronchial epithelium (bronchial tissue samples) pre and&#xD;
      post treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the changes in methylation patterns in the exhaled breath. IV. To evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy of inhaled Vidaza® on intra-thoracic tumors (response rate by Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] criteria for intrapulmonary lesions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To estimate the progression free, intra-thoracic tumor progression free and overall&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To determine the minimum effective dose of inhaled Vidaza® required to induce changes in&#xD;
      the methylation status and re-expression of a panel of genes, including 5 candidate tumor&#xD;
      suppressor genes (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A [p16], h-cadherin [H-Cad], opioid&#xD;
      binding protein/cell adhesion molecule-like [OPCML], secreted frizzled-related protein 1&#xD;
      [SFRP-1], and ras association domain family 1 [RASSF1A]) that are silenced in 20-50% of&#xD;
      bronchial tissue of heavy smokers with lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive azacitidine via nebulizer over 20 minutes once daily (QD) on days 1-5 and&#xD;
      15-19. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 weeks in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may continue treatment on a case-by-case basis&#xD;
      at the discretion of principal investigator and Institutional Review Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4-6 weeks and then every 3&#xD;
      months thereafter.&#xD;
