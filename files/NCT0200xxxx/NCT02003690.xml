  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Of all psychiatric diagnoses, bipolar disorder imparts the greatest risk for completed&#xD;
      suicide in adolescence, and is further associated with poor psychosocial functioning,&#xD;
      substance abuse and legal difficulties, and exorbitant healthcare costs exceeding those for&#xD;
      other adolescent psychiatric conditions. Treatment guidelines indicate optimal management of&#xD;
      pediatric bipolar disorder includes a combination of medication and psychotherapy. Yet,&#xD;
      little is known about effective psychotherapy approaches for this population, and none&#xD;
      expressly target suicidality. An efficacious, cost-effective psychosocial intervention for&#xD;
      adolescents with bipolar disorder has great potential to decrease the substantial morbidity,&#xD;
      mortality and costs associated with adolescent bipolar disorder.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Of all psychiatric diagnoses, bipolar disorder (BP) imparts the greatest risk for completed&#xD;
      suicide in adolescence, and is associated with other negative outcomes including poor&#xD;
      psychosocial functioning and substance abuse. Furthermore, healthcare costs for adolescents&#xD;
      with BP exceed those for other adolescent psychiatric conditions. Treatment guidelines&#xD;
      indicate optimal management of pediatric BP includes a combination of pharmacotherapy and&#xD;
      psychotherapy. Yet, little is known about effective psychotherapy approaches for this&#xD;
      population, and none expressly target suicidality. An efficacious, cost-effective&#xD;
      psychotherapy for adolescents with BP has great potential to decrease the substantial&#xD;
      morbidity, mortality and costs associated with this illness. Dialectical Behavior Therapy&#xD;
      (DBT) is a skills-based psychotherapy originally developed for adults with borderline&#xD;
      personality disorder. DBT holds promise for adolescents with BP given shared treatment&#xD;
      targets including suicidality and psychosocial functioning. Our group's preliminary data on&#xD;
      DBT for adolescents with BP provide strong support for the feasibility and acceptability of&#xD;
      the treatment model, and indicate DBT is associated with improvement in targeted treatment&#xD;
      domains including suicidality, emotional dysregulation, and depression, and these&#xD;
      improvements are greater among adolescents receiving DBT as compared with standard of care&#xD;
      (SOC) psychotherapy delivered at our Child and Adolescent Bipolar Services (CABS) specialty&#xD;
      clinic. The proposed study aims to evaluate in a randomized controlled trial the efficacy of&#xD;
      DBT + pharmacotherapy as compared with CABS SOC psychotherapy + pharmacotherapy over 2 year&#xD;
      followup among adolescents (age 12-18) with BP (n=100). Primary outcome domains include&#xD;
      suicidal events and mood symptoms. Our team includes an expert in health services cost&#xD;
      effectiveness, enabling us to examine the cost effectiveness of DBT. Our exploratory aim is&#xD;
      to elucidate moderators and mediators of DBT treatment response in this population.&#xD;
      Identification of patient factors that predict response to DBT, as well as mechanisms by&#xD;
      which DBT benefits patients, will directly inform the planful dissemination of the treatment&#xD;
      (if shown to be effective) for those most likely to benefit. Furthermore, a supplement is&#xD;
      enabling examination of neural mechanisms underlying DBT treatment response as assessed via&#xD;
      fMRI at pre- and mid-treatment. These aims are in direct accord with the NIMH Strategic Plan&#xD;
      to prioritize research on improved treatments for mental illness while also generating&#xD;
      information regarding underlying mechanisms of disorder; facilitate widespread use of&#xD;
      evidencebased interventions by demonstrating cost effectiveness; and systematically study&#xD;
      elements of personalized intervention. Furthermore, this project aligns with the mission of&#xD;
      the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention Research Prioritization Task Force: to&#xD;
      prioritize gaps in the research that will reduce the rate of suicide and suicide attempts, to&#xD;
      target particularly high-risk groups, and to move toward uptake of evidence-based&#xD;
      interventions for suicidality.&#xD;
