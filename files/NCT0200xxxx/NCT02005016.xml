    <textblock>
      This study examines aphasia treatment response among Veterans and non-Veterans living with&#xD;
      aphasia. It seeks to identify cognitive and neural factors which are predictive of positive&#xD;
      response to treatment targeting naming impairments in aphasia. It also examines the&#xD;
      dose-response relationship for naming treatment. More broadly, it seeks to determine who&#xD;
      aphasia therapy works best for, and how much aphasia therapy is sufficient to achieve&#xD;
      positive treatment response.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Language and communicative impairments following stroke (aphasia) affect more than 30% of&#xD;
      stroke survivors, with an incidence of over 180,000 new cases annually. The consequences of&#xD;
      aphasia are far reaching and can affect psychosocial adjustment, family role participation,&#xD;
      vocational opportunities, and the ability to function independently in society. Recent&#xD;
      estimates suggest that VHA outpatient clinics see 2000 new cases of aphasia each year,&#xD;
      meaning that approximately 20,000 enrolled VHA patients and 100,000 United States Veterans&#xD;
      are currently living with the condition. In response to this need, the VA Pittsburgh&#xD;
      Healthcare System Geriatric Research, Education, and Clinical Center (GRECC) initiated the&#xD;
      Program for Intensive Residential Aphasia Treatment and Education (PIRATE) in January 2009.&#xD;
      PIRATE is a clinical demonstration project that provides approximately 100 hours of&#xD;
      cognitive-linguistically oriented aphasia treatment to community dwelling Veterans over a&#xD;
      4-week period. PIRATE currently serves 18 Veterans per year in bi-monthly sessions. Resource&#xD;
      limitations associated with PIRATE and aphasia treatment in general require that treatments&#xD;
      be offered in the most cost-effective doses to those Veterans most likely to benefit from&#xD;
      them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This treatment-effectiveness research study addresses these issues by examining the&#xD;
      dose-response relationship for semantically-oriented naming treatment, and identifying&#xD;
      cognitive, psycholinguistic and neuroanatomical predictors of treatment success. Study&#xD;
      participants (n=60, over a 4-year period) will be recruited nationwide from Veterans enrolled&#xD;
      in PIRATE. They will have their naming performance measured prior to PIRATE entry, during&#xD;
      each week of treatment, and at program exit/follow-up. A battery of cognitive measures and&#xD;
      structural magnetic resonance images of their brains will also be collected prior to&#xD;
      treatment. Participants' performance on trained and untrained lexical items and a&#xD;
      standardized measure of naming performance will be compared across time intervals to specify&#xD;
      the therapy amounts for which maximum treatment benefits are achieved. Their treatment&#xD;
      outcomes will also be correlated with specific cognitive test scores and the location and&#xD;
      extent of their brain lesions to identify cognitive and neurological markers predictive of&#xD;
      positive treatment response. Treatment response will also be compared across participants&#xD;
      with different psycholinguistic profiles, to determine which groups of patients show greatest&#xD;
      benefit from semantically-oriented naming treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study should provide answers to two interlocking questions: for whom is aphasia therapy&#xD;
      most effective, and how much of it is needed to optimize treatment outcomes. These answers&#xD;
      have the potential to set transformative new standards for how aphasia treatment is delivered&#xD;
      within VHA and to stroke survivors with aphasia more broadly.&#xD;

    <description>The Philadelphia Naming Test is a performance-based measure commonly used to assess naming (word production) ability among adults with aphasia. Participants are shown 175 pictures of common objects and asked to name each stimulus item within 30 seconds. Score range is from 0 to 175 (number out of 175 items that were correctly named), with higher scores representing better performance. Change in PNT score from entry to exit is the primary study outcome. Mean PNT change score measures treatment-related changes in naming ability.</description>

    <description>The Comprehensive Aphasia Test (CAT) is a performance-based measure of language processing across multiple language domains commonly used to assess language-processing ability among adults with aphasia. The CAT Modality Mean T-Score represents an measurement of overall language-processing ability (aphasia severity). Scores are on a T-score scale (mean score 50, 2 SD range from 30 to 70), with higher scores representing better performance. Change in CAT score from entry to exit (secondary outcome) measures treatment-related changes in overall aphasia severity.</description>

          <description>The Philadelphia Naming Test (PNT) is a performance-based measure commonly used to assess naming (word production) ability among adults with aphasia. Participants are shown 175 pictures of common objects and asked to name each stimulus item within 30 seconds. Score range is from 0 to 175 (number out of 175 items that were correctly named), with higher scores representing better performance. Baseline PNT measures indicate pre-treatment naming (word production) ability.</description>

        <description>The Comprehensive Aphasia Test (CAT) is a performance-based measure of language processing across multiple language domains commonly used to assess language-processing ability among adults with aphasia. The CAT Modality Mean T-Score represents an measurement of overall language-processing ability (aphasia severity). Scores are on a T-score scale (mean score 50, 2 SD range from 30 to 70), with higher scores representing better performance. Change in CAT score from entry to exit (secondary outcome) measures treatment-related changes in overall aphasia severity.</description>
