    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, multicenter, phase 1, dose escalation study of TAK-659 in adult&#xD;
      participants with advanced solid tumor and lymphoma malignancies. This study will be the&#xD;
      first to administer TAK-659 to humans. The participants population during dose escalation&#xD;
      (Part A) will consist of adults previously diagnosed with any form of a solid tumor or&#xD;
      lymphoma for which standard, curative, or life-prolonging treatment does not exist or is no&#xD;
      longer effective. This first-in-human (FIH) study will include 5 dose expansion cohorts in&#xD;
      refractory and/or relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma&#xD;
      (DLBCL), indolent Non Hodgkin Lymphoma (iNHL), Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL), Post Transplant&#xD;
      Lymphoproliferative Disorder (PTLD) (Part B) following completion of dose escalation (Part&#xD;
      A).&#xD;

    <description>DLT was defined as one of the following adverse events considered by the investigator to be possibly related to study drug: Grade 4 neutropenia unresolved to ≤Grade 1 or baseline &gt;7 days in absence of growth factor support;≥Grade 3 neutropenia with fever and/or infection; Grade 4 thrombocytopenia unresolved to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline &gt;7 days or a platelet count &lt;10,000/mm^3; ≥Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding; Grade 4 anemia; ≥Grade 3 nonhematological toxicity except (nausea and/or vomiting or diarrhea that has not resolved after 48 hours of treatment, transient fatigue, asymptomatic lipase elevation in absence of amylase elevation, asymptomatic elevation of a single liver enzyme in absence of bilirubin elevation);Inability to administer at least 75% of planned doses of study drug within Cycle 1;TAK-659-related nonhematologic toxicities ≥Grade 2 that required dose reduction or therapy discontinuation.</description>

    <time_frame>First dose of study drug through 28 days after the last dose of study drug (Up to 49 months )</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product whether or not it is related to the medicinal product. This includes any newly occurring event, or a previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency since the administration of study drug.&#xD;
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is a medically important event. Relationship of each AE to study drug will be determined by the Investigator.</description>

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received, an opportunity for the primary publication of the research has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com/Approach for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
