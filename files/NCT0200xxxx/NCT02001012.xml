  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary studies have supported the background efficacy of local standard anti-malarial&#xD;
      medications in the treatment of uncomplicated knowlesi malaria, however there are no current&#xD;
      WHO treatment guidelines for this infection. There are both health cost benefits to a more&#xD;
      rapidly acting agent, and due to difficulties with microscopic identification there may be&#xD;
      more effective treatment for all malaria species if an aligned treatment guideline could be&#xD;
      supported. We are currently conducting a separate RCT using a similar protocol evaluating&#xD;
      artesunate-mefloquine versus chloroquine for uncomplicated P. knowlesi malaria. However&#xD;
      artemether-lumefantrine should also be compared against chloroquine due to the fact it is&#xD;
      also a first line anti-malarial recommended in Malaysia, and there are potential differences&#xD;
      in efficacy due to the different administration, absorption and half-life of&#xD;
      artemether-lumefantrine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to test whether the fixed combination of artesunate-mefloquine is&#xD;
      superior to chloroquine in order to define the optimal treatment for both uncomplicated P.&#xD;
      knowlesi infection in both adults and children in this region.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Naturally acquired infections with Plasmodium knowlesi, the fifth human malaria, are growing&#xD;
      [1]. Since 2004 increasing numbers of cases have been reported from residents and returned&#xD;
      travelers predominantly from Malaysia and other countries in South-East Asia including&#xD;
      Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar, Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines [2-8]. Cases coincide&#xD;
      with the geographic distribution of its natural simian hosts (long-tailed and pig-tailed&#xD;
      macaques) and Anopheles leucosphyrus group mosquito vector [9, 10], with potential&#xD;
      human-to-human transmission unknown. Eastern Malaysia appears to be the epicentre, with&#xD;
      around 1400 PCR-confirmed P. knowlesi human mono-infections reported in 2009, comprising 41%&#xD;
      of 2,189 total malaria cases in Sarawak [11] and 343 cases from selected samples sent to&#xD;
      Sabah's State Reference Laboratory [12]. P. knowlesi is also now the most common cause of&#xD;
      malaria in different contrasting regions, including 70% of malaria admissions in the heavily&#xD;
      forested area of Kapit in Sarawak [1, 13], 63% of samples from the interior division of Sabah&#xD;
      [14], and in 87% of malaria admissions in the deforested coastal area of Kudat in Sabah,&#xD;
      where it is also the major cause of malaria in children [15].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the increase in reported incidence, difficulties with microscopic diagnosis and a&#xD;
      lack of PCR based epidemiological surveillance studies throughout South-East Asia mean the&#xD;
      true disease burden is underestimated. P. knowlesi is microscopically misidentified as P .&#xD;
      falciparum and P. malariae due to morphological similarities in the early trophozoite, and&#xD;
      late trophozoite and schizont life stages respectively, with studies showing up to 80% of P.&#xD;
      malariae [16-19] and 7-12% of P. falciparum [1, 16] in this region are actually P. knowlesi&#xD;
      when definitively evaluated with PCR. Misdiagnosis has concerning treatment implications, as&#xD;
      unlike P. malariae, knowlesi malaria has a rapid 24-hour replication rate and can cause&#xD;
      hyperparasitaemia, severe complications and fatal outcomes [13, 17, 18], while the&#xD;
      inadvertent use of chloroquine for widely chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum may also have&#xD;
      fatal consequences.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Despite the increase in reported incidence, difficulties with microscopic diagnosis and a&#xD;
      lack of PCR based epidemiological surveillance studies throughout South-East Asia mean the&#xD;
      true disease burden is underestimated. P. knowlesi is microscopically misidentified as P .&#xD;

      malariae [16-19] and 7-12% of P. falciparum [1, 16] in this region are actually P. knowlesi&#xD;
      when definitively evaluated with PCR. Current rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) for malaria can&#xD;
      distinguish falciparum Current rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) for malaria can distinguish&#xD;
      falciparum from other Plasmodium species with a sensitivity of up to 99% at parasite counts &gt;&#xD;
      1,000/ Î¼L [20], but a knowlesi specific antigen has not been developed and current antibody&#xD;
      panels are unable to differentiate between P. knowlesi and other mixed Plasmodium spp.&#xD;
      infections [21]. Misdiagnosis has concerning treatment implications, as unlike P. malariae,&#xD;
      knowlesi malaria has a rapid 24-hour replication rate and can cause hyperparasitaemia, severe&#xD;
      complications and fatal outcomes [13, 17, 18], while the inadvertent use of chloroquine for&#xD;
      widely chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum may also have fatal consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Artemether-lumefantrine (A-L) is a common and widely available ACT, and along with&#xD;
      artesunate-mefloquine (AS-MQ) is one of only 2 first line WHO recommended options for the&#xD;
      treatment of uncomplicated P.falciparum infection which are registered in Malaysia and&#xD;
      produced according to international good manufacturing practice (GMP) standards. ACTs are the&#xD;
      current mainstay of malaria eradication efforts 28, with a mechanism of action resulting both&#xD;
      in a rapid reduction in parasite mass and resolution of clinical features, while the long&#xD;
      acting component eliminates residual parasites and delays the development of de novo&#xD;
      resistance 29,30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial reported use of A-L for knowlesi malaria was from our retrospective study at a&#xD;
      tertiary referral hospital in Sabah, where a small sample size of 8 out of 34 patients with&#xD;
      PCR confirmed uncomplicated P.knowlesi infection were treated with oral&#xD;
      artemether-lumefantrine. Median microscopic parasite clearance time was 1 day (range 0-3),&#xD;
      which was significantly faster than those receiving chloroquine (median 2.5 days, range 1-3),&#xD;
      while this also resulted in fewer days of hospitalization and health sector associated costs.&#xD;
      The proportion remaining parasitaemic at day 1 was 33% 16. Our subsequent prospective study&#xD;
      at the same site documented 109 knowlesi malaria patients successfully treated with A-L, with&#xD;
      no recurrences identified. Unpublished data from this study showed that of the patients with&#xD;
      uncomplicated P. knowlesi malaria enrolled, 51 received A-L monotherapy, with a median&#xD;
      parasite clearance time of 2 days31.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of A-L is required in addition to AS-MQ, as there are a number of pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      and pharmacodynamic differences that may affect clinical outcomes. In contrast to AS-MQ,&#xD;
      adequate oral absorption of A-L requires co-adminstration with fatty foods, with twice daily&#xD;
      dosing28. The longer acting partner drug in A-L is lumefantrine, which has a half life of 3&#xD;
      days compared to mefloquine in AS-MQ which is 21 days. Therefore there may be differences in&#xD;
      P. knowlesi recurrence at day 28 or 42 as the follow up time recommended by WHO for&#xD;
      anti-malarial efficacy monitoring studies 32.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chloroquine with primaquine was initially suggested to have favourable treatment outcomes for&#xD;
      uncomplicated P. knowlesi human infections after a retrospective review of patients from&#xD;
      Kapit Hospital in Sarawak in 2004 15. Following this a single prospective observational study&#xD;
      conducted at the same site between 2006-7 administered chloroquine as a total base dose of&#xD;
      25mg/kg and primaquine as a gametocidal agent to 73 patients with uncomplicated PCR-confirmed&#xD;
      P. knowlesi malaria, with results showing median fever clearance of 26 hours, mean times to&#xD;
      50% and 90% microscopic parasite clearance of 3.1 and 10.3 hours respectively, and a median&#xD;
      PCR adjusted clearance time of 3 days. The proportion remaining parasitaemic at day 1 was&#xD;
      55%. None of the 60 patients who completed the 28-day follow up demonstrated any evidence of&#xD;
      resistance, re-infection or recrudescence 25.&#xD;
