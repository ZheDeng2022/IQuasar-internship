      BACKGROUND Resistance exercise training with free weights or weight machines clearly improves&#xD;
      glucose (sugar) control in type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, many patients with T2D would&#xD;
      prefer not to attend an exercise facility, for reasons of cost and/or convenience.&#xD;
      Coinvestigator Jonathon Fowles has developed and pilot-tested a home-based exercise program&#xD;
      for people with T2D using resistance bands. However, the effects of resistance-bands training&#xD;
      (on glucose control in T2D have not been evaluated in a high-quality randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIMS To determine the effects of six months of progressive home-based resistance&#xD;
      bands training (RBT) versus no RBT in people with T2D on blood glucose control (HbA1c,&#xD;
      primary outcome), waist circumference, heart disease risk factors, and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS A total of 100 T2D participants will be randomized to 2 arms: home-based RBT (RBT-H)&#xD;
      or aerobic training only (ATO). Both groups will accumulate 150 minutes per week of aerobic&#xD;
      exercise such as walking. The resistance exercise workout includes 12 exercises, targeting&#xD;
      all major muscle groups. RBT-H subjects will complete most exercise at home with periodic&#xD;
      supervision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIGNIFICANCE The global burden of type 2 diabetes is increasing, and complications of the&#xD;
      illness occur primarily in those whose glucose control is fair or poor. If exercise training&#xD;
      with resistance bands improves glucose control, it could be beneficial to the large numbers&#xD;
      of patients who cannot travel to a gym or cannot afford gym membership. If resistance&#xD;
      exercise is then adopted by more patients, it is likely that the morbidity associated with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes will be decreased. This is particularly true if such training also improves&#xD;
      quality of life, and more people are thus inclined to continue exercising in the long term.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Resistance exercise training with free weights or weight machines clearly improves&#xD;
      glycemic control in type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, many patients with T2D would prefer not&#xD;
      to, or are not able to attend an exercise facility,for reasons of cost, comfort or&#xD;
      convenience. Coinvestigator Dr. Jonathon Fowles developed a home-based exercise program for&#xD;
      people with T2D using resistance bands. Before-after studies using this intervention have&#xD;
      found improvements in glycemic control, strength, and blood pressure. However, the effects of&#xD;
      resistance-bands training (RBT) on glycemic control in T2D have not been evaluated in a&#xD;
      high-quality randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH QUESTIONS To determine the effects of six months of progressive home-based RBT plus&#xD;
      aerobic exercise, versus home-based aerobic exercise alone, in previously-sedentary people&#xD;
      with T2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS After a 2-week run-in period to assess adherence, 100 T2D subjects not currently&#xD;
      engaging in regular exercise will be randomized in equal numbers to 2 arms: primarily&#xD;
      home-based RBT (RBT-H) or aerobic only control (ATO) . Both groups will complete aerobic&#xD;
      training: accumulation of 150 minutes per week of walking or jogging, measured by&#xD;
      accelerometers. The RBT workout will include 12 distinctive exercises, targeting all major&#xD;
      muscle groups. Subjects will be trained in groups led by a Kinesiologist (exercise&#xD;
      specialist) twice per week for two weeks during run-in. After randomization, the RBT-H group&#xD;
      will perform RBT three times per week. RBT-H participants will perform RBT three times per&#xD;
      week primarily at home, with supervised group sessions weekly in weeks 1-4, every 2 weeks in&#xD;
      weeks 5-8, and every 4 weeks thereafter to ensure proper form and appropriate progression.&#xD;
      Adherence to RBT will be verified through direct supervision of group sessions, and&#xD;
      completion of detailed exercise logs for home-based and group sessions. Participants will&#xD;
      photograph the log after each session and email the photo to a designated email address.&#xD;
      Study outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 12 and 24 weeks post-randomization. Dietary&#xD;
      advice will be standardized through repeated sessions with a dietician, and doses of&#xD;
      medications altering glucose, lipids and BP will be held constant unless change is medically&#xD;
      urgent. Primary analyses will be intention-to-treat, using repeated measures mixed modeling.&#xD;
      Per-protocol analyses will be done including only subjects who completed &gt;70% of prescribed&#xD;
      exercise sessions and all end-of-study outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIGNIFICANCE The global burden of type 2 diabetes is increasing, and complications of the&#xD;
      illness occur primarily in those whose glycemic control is fair or poor. If home-based&#xD;
      exercise training with resistance bands improves glycemic control and other vascular risk&#xD;
      factors, it could be beneficial to the large numbers of patients who prefer not to have to&#xD;
      travel to a gym or cannot afford gym membership. If resistance exercise is then adopted by&#xD;
      more patients, it is likely that the morbidity associated with type 2 diabetes will be&#xD;
      decreased. This is particularly true if such training also improves quality of life, and more&#xD;
      people are thus inclined to continue exercising in the long term.&#xD;

    <description>All subjects will participate in a 10-week ramp-in period with the goal of achieving 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week. Walking and jogging will be the primary modes of achieving the prescribed aerobic activity as these are the modes of aerobic exercise that are most accurately recorded by an accelerometer. Subjects will use the Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) to guide aerobic exercise intensity. Aerobic activity will be objectively monitored by the Technogym MyWellness Key (MWK) accelerometer, which is a lightweight device worn on the waistband.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Both of the bands + AT groups will engage in RBT 3 times per week, progressing to 3 sets of 8-12 repetitions of 12 exercises. The exercises will be: chair squat, sitting chest press, seated rear fly, seated row, overhead press, lateral raise, biceps curl, triceps extension, leg extension, hamstring curl, gluteal extension, and abdominals. The resistance band exercise sessions will be between 25-60 minutes.&#xD;
Participants in this group will attend supervised group sessions weekly in weeks 1-4, every 2 weeks in weeks 5-8, and every 4 weeks thereafter to ensure proper form and appropriate progression. Participants in this group will be responsible to complete all remaining sessions (a total of 3 per week, including supervised sessions) at home on their own time.</description>
