      The purpose of phase I clinical trial is to evaluate safety and efficacy in subjects with&#xD;
      moderately active Crohn's disease after injection for 28days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of phase IIa clinical trial is to determine therapeutic safety and efficacy of&#xD;

      Crohn's disease is mysterious chronic inflammatory bowel disease. It usually happen in the&#xD;
      young age and last forever. It is not yet clearly known the origin of crohn's disease.&#xD;
      However, crohn's disease therapy is getting developed by using immunosuppressant and&#xD;
      TNF-alpha inhibitor. Nonetheless, some patients still don't react to TNF-alpha inhibitor&#xD;
      which is most effective treatment. Also, Even though some other patients reacted to the&#xD;
      treatment at first, the effect of treatment decreases over time. Plus, long-term use of&#xD;
      TNF-alpha inhibitor can lead to complication of infection and occurrence of malignant tumor&#xD;
      like lymphoma. Recently, treatment of intractable crohn's disease is attempted by using stem&#xD;
      cell. Especially, Mesenchymal stem cell is well-known for immunosuppression,&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory ability and cell differentiation ability to various lineage cell as non&#xD;
      hematopoietic stromal cell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the body get infected by the pathogens, innate immune response operate as the primary&#xD;
      defence mechanism. at this time, there are some receptors reacting first such as&#xD;
      TLR(toll-like receptor) and NLR(nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain) which is located&#xD;
      in the cytoplasm of a cell. It is reported that the activities of TLR which is expressed by&#xD;
      Mesenchymal stem cells play an important roles about immunomodulatory ability of Mesenchymal&#xD;
      stem cells. Furthermore, human Umbilical Cord Blood derived-Universal Stem Cells( hUCB-USCs)&#xD;
      manifest TLR and NLR of Mesenchymal Stem cells at the same time. when those receptors become&#xD;
      activation, it maximize ability of immunomodulatory. Therefore, hUCB-USCs can be utilized to&#xD;
      cure intractable autoimmune disease like Crohn's disease. Further, It has huge possibility as&#xD;
      cell therapy products for autoimmune disease.&#xD;
