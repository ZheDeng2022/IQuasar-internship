      This is a study to determine the safety and effectiveness of BKM120 plus capecitabine in&#xD;
      breast cancer patients with brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both capecitabine and BMK120 have previously shown activity in patients with breast cancer.&#xD;
      Like capecitabine, BMK120 is also effective in crossing the blood brain barrier making it a&#xD;
      preferred candidate for its evaluation in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, single-arm study to determine the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      BKM120 plus capecitabine in breast cancer patients with brain metastases. 40 patients will be&#xD;
      included, who have either ER+/HER2-, HER2+ or triple negative breast cancer..&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Graded Prognostic Assessment (GPA) is a recently developed, validated prognostic score&#xD;
      for patients with brain metastases. The Graded Prognostic Assessment will be utilized to&#xD;
      evaluate efficacy in this clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Capecitabine is a prodrug which is enzymatically converted to 5-fluorouracil in its tumor&#xD;
      target where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows tumor growth. It is currently FDA approved&#xD;
      for both colorectal and breast cancer. BMK120 is a pan phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase&#xD;
      inhibitor being developed under IND# 102,823 by Novartis Corporation. As of September 2012&#xD;
      over 600 patients had been enrolled in fourteen separate Novartis sponsored monotherapy or&#xD;
      combination therapy clinical studies of BMK120.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling regulates diverse cellular functions including&#xD;
      cell proliferation, survival, translational regulation of protein synthesis, glucose&#xD;
      metabolism, cell migration, and angiogenesis. PI3K signaling also serves a central role in&#xD;
      the pathogenesis of numerous cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Constitutive activation of PI3K signaling is known to be a critical step in mediating the&#xD;
      transforming potential of oncogenes and tumor suppressors in many tumor types. Resistance to&#xD;
      a variety of therapeutic interventions, including hormonal therapy, anti-HER2 therapies and&#xD;
      chemotherapy can also be linked to constitutive activation of the PI3K pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data suggest that activation of the PI3K pathway is a predictor of a poor&#xD;
      prognostic outcome in many cancer types. Thus, as a pan-PI3K inhibitor, BMK120 may provide a&#xD;
      therapeutic benefit to patients with MBC. Both capecitabine and BMK120 have previously shown&#xD;
      activity in patients with MBC. Like capecitabine, BMK120 is also effective in crossing the&#xD;
      blood brain barrier making it a preferred candidate for its evaluation in patients with MBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the HER2 receptor which is overexpressed or&#xD;
      amplified in approximately 20-25% of breast cancers. The clinical benefit of trastuzumab in&#xD;
      women with metastatic breast cancer has been demonstrated in two pivotal studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current clinical experience with BMK120 has shown that its most frequent adverse events (AEs)&#xD;
      include fatigue, decreased appetite, diarrhea, hyperglycemia, nausea, rash and mood&#xD;
      alteration disorders. Therefore patients will be closely monitored for fasting plasma glucose&#xD;
      (FPG) HbA1c, and insulin C-peptide. Patients will also be frequently and routinely evaluated&#xD;
      for mood disorders and disturbances. The remaining most frequent AEs will be detected by&#xD;
      regular, frequent monitoring with symptomatic treatment to be provided as required.&#xD;

                  least 12 consecutive months (i.e., who has had menses any time in the preceding&#xD;
                  12 consecutive months), must have a negative serum pregnancy test â‰¤ 72 hours&#xD;
                  prior to initiating treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if&#xD;
                  they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate&#xD;
                  clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six&#xD;
                  months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL [for US only:&#xD;
                  and estradiol &lt; 20 pg/mL] or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or&#xD;
                  without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone,&#xD;
                  only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up&#xD;
                  hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically&#xD;
                  capable of becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during&#xD;
                  treatment for 4 weeks (5 T1/2) after stopping treatment. The highly effective&#xD;
                  contraception is defined as either:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  i. True abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle&#xD;
                  of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
             ii. Sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without&#xD;
             hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In case of oophorectomy alone,&#xD;
             only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone&#xD;
             level assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             iii. Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of&#xD;
             the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). For female subjects on the study, the&#xD;
             vasectomised male partner should be the sole partner for that patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
             iv. Use of a combination of any two of the following (a+b):&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or&#xD;
                  cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Oral contraception, injected or implanted hormonal methods are not allowed&#xD;
                       as BKM120 potentially decreases the effectiveness of hormonal&#xD;
                       contraceptives.&#xD;
&#xD;
         25. Patient has known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection&#xD;
&#xD;
         26. Patient has history of another malignancy within 5 years, except cured basal cell&#xD;
             carcinoma of the skin or excised carcinoma in situ of the cervix&#xD;
&#xD;
         27. Patient is unable or unwilling to abide by the study protocol or cooperate fully with&#xD;
             the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
         28. Patient is concurrently using other approved or investigational antineoplastic agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
         29. Patient taking or needing enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
         30. Patient has an acute viral hepatitis or a history of chronic or active HBV or HCV&#xD;
             infection&#xD;
