    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating a drug called meloxicam to see if it provides a benefit to&#xD;
      people receiving Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (AHSCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant is currently scheduled to receive an AHSCT, which is a procedure that removes&#xD;
      blood-forming stem cells (cells from which all blood cells develop) from the body. These stem&#xD;
      cells are stored and later given back to the participant by a process called apheresis. This&#xD;
      is a standard procedure to treat certain blood diseases such as lymphoma and multiple&#xD;
      myeloma. However the use of meloxicam with this procedure is considered investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meloxicam is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) which is given to decrease fever,&#xD;
      swelling and pain that may come with inflammation. It has been approved by the FDA for the&#xD;
      treatment of arthritis however it has not been approved for use in people receiving AHSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare the combination of meloxicam with a drug called G-CSF (also called&#xD;
      neupogen), to the combination of G-CSF with an agent that has no medicine (placebo). G-CSF is&#xD;
      a substance that causes blood stem cells to change or increase in number when given to people&#xD;
      undergoing AHSCT. The researchers would like to learn if giving meloxicam in combination with&#xD;
      G-CSF to people before they undergo AHSCT will increase the number of stem cells available in&#xD;
      the blood to collect and make the collection process easier.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After the screening procedures confirm that the participant is eligible to participate in the&#xD;
      research study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because no one knows which of the study options is best, the participant will be &quot;randomized&quot;&#xD;
      into one of the study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  G-CSF with meloxicam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  G-CSF with placebo (pills with no medicine)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization means that the participants are put into a group by chance. It is like flipping&#xD;
      a coin. Neither the participant nor the research doctor will choose what group the&#xD;
      participant will be in. The participant will have an equal chance of being placed in any&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Study Drug (meloxicam or placebo): If the participant takes part in this research study,&#xD;
      the participant will be given a study drug-dosing diary. The study drug will come as a pill&#xD;
      that the participant will take by mouth daily for 5 days, starting 6 days (Day -6) before the&#xD;
      participant is scheduled to undergo the first apheresis procedure (Day 0) and continuing&#xD;
      until 2 days before apheresis (Day -2). The participant will take meloxicam or placebo for a&#xD;
      total of 5 days. The diary will also include special instructions for taking the study&#xD;
      drug(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      -G-CSF: All participants receive G-CSF as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous) in the&#xD;
      clinic, daily starting 4 days (Day -4) before the first apheresis procedure (Day 0). The&#xD;
      participant will continue to receive G-CSF for 3 days after apheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Apheresis: The participant may receive up to 4 apheresis procedures, depending on how their&#xD;
      body reacts to the stem cell mobilization. The participant will receive either meloxicam or&#xD;
      placebo in combination with G-CSF on Days -6 to -2 as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Exams: While the participant is receiving this procedure, the participant will have&#xD;
      regular physical exams and they will be asked specific questions about any problems that they&#xD;
      might be having. The participant will also have blood tests every day to look at how their&#xD;
      bone marrow is recovering, to give possible transfusional support, and how to see how their&#xD;
      liver and kidneys are functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned Follow-up: The investigators would like to keep track of the participant's medical&#xD;
      condition for the rest of their life. The investigators would like keep track of the&#xD;
      participant's medical condition for 6 months after the study to see how they are doing.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must meet the following criteria on screening examination to be eligible&#xD;
             to participate in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with hematologic malignancies for whom autologous stem cell transplantation&#xD;
             is deemed clinically appropriate. Patients participating in this study are patients&#xD;
             who are going for their first attempt at stem cell mobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or Hodgkin's lymphoma: refractory/relapsed but chemosensitive&#xD;
             disease. Patients with CR or PR will be eligible for this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The designation of PR requires all of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least a 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to six of&#xD;
             the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. These nodes or masses should be selected&#xD;
             according to all of the following: they should be clearly measurable in at least 2&#xD;
             perpendicular dimensions; if possible they should be from disparate regions of the&#xD;
             body; and they should include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease&#xD;
             whenever these sites are involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No increase should be observed in the size of other nodes, liver, or spleen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Splenic and hepatic nodules must regress by ≥ 50% in their SPD or, for single nodules,&#xD;
             in the greatest transverse diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  With the exception of splenic and hepatic nodules, involvement of other organs is&#xD;
             usually assessable and no measurable disease should be present.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bone marrow assessment is irrelevant for determination of a PR if the sample was&#xD;
             positive before treatment. However, if positive, the cell type should be specified&#xD;
             (eg, large-cell lymphoma or small neoplastic B cells). Patients who achieve a CR by&#xD;
             the above criteria, but who have persistent morphologic bone marrow involvement will&#xD;
             be considered partial responders. Multiple myeloma in first or second remission.&#xD;
             Patients with CR or VGPR will be eligible for this protocol. [VGPR: Serum and urine&#xD;
             M-protein detectable by immunofixation only but not on electrophoresis or 90% or&#xD;
             greater reduction in serum M-protein plus urine M-protein level &lt;100mg per 24 h]&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ages 18-75 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients on NSAIDs will be eligible only when they are off NSAIDs for a month.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who exhibit any of the following conditions at screening will not be&#xD;
             eligible for admission into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cardiac disease: symptomatic congestive heart failure or RVG or echocardiogram&#xD;
             determined left ventricular ejection fraction of &lt; 45%, active angina pectoris, or&#xD;
             uncontrolled hypertensionParticipants may not be receiving any other study agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pulmonary disease: severe chronic obstructive lung disease, or symptomatic restrictive&#xD;
             lung disease, or corrected DLCO of &lt; 50% of predicted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Renal disease: serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hepatic disease: SGOT or SGPT &gt; 3 x normal; serum bilirubin &gt;2.0 mg/dl that is not due&#xD;
             to Gilbert's syndrome or hemolysis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or lactation&#xD;

          -  Patients with NSAIDs allergies, including patients who have experienced a prior GI&#xD;
             bleed due to NSAIDs will be excluded. Patients who have had a recent GI bleed less&#xD;
             than 2 weeks ago will be excluded. Patients who are on therapeutic dose anticoagulants&#xD;
             will be excluded from this protocol.&#xD;
