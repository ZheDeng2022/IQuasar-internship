  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with localized prostate cancer are routinely treated with radiation therapy to the&#xD;
      entire prostate gland. The investigators can identify where the cancer is concentrated in the&#xD;
      prostate gland using a newer specialized imaging technique called 11C Choline PET (stands for&#xD;
      choline positron emission tomography). This is different from the older type of PET scan that&#xD;
      has been used in the past (called FDG PET) which has not been as accurate as the new PET scan&#xD;
      for identifying where the cancer is in the prostate gland. It has also been shown that&#xD;
      delivering higher doses of radiation to prostate cancer cells in the prostate have resulted&#xD;
      in better cure rates in patients with prostate cancer. Therefore for goal number one the&#xD;
      investigators want to give higher radiation dose to the prostate cancer cells. But the&#xD;
      challenge has been that delivering higher doses of radiation to the prostate gland may also&#xD;
      increase the chance of complications from the higher doses of radiation to the rectum,&#xD;
      bladder and surrounding area. Therefore for goal number two the investigators want to&#xD;
      minimize radiation dose to the rectum, bladder and surrounding area. 3-Tesla Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Imaging (3T MRI) is a new kink of scan that will be used in this study to identify&#xD;
      the urethra in the prostate so that the investigators can minimize the radiation dose to the&#xD;
      urethra. The investigators believe the 3T MRI scan is able to point to the areas of cancer&#xD;
      that may be able to predict how well the treatments may work, as well as which areas of the&#xD;
      tumor appear to be responding to failing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will keep the dose of radiation to the rectum and bladder as&#xD;
      low as possible while increasing radiation dose to parts of the prostate with more cancer&#xD;
      cells. The investigators will compare the cure rates in this study with the cure rates of&#xD;
      other patients receiving the standard treatment in which the same dose of radiation is&#xD;
      delivered throughout the prostate gland. The investigators will also compare the rates of&#xD;
      complications in this study with the rates of complications in patients receiving the&#xD;
      standard treatment in which the same dose of radiation is delivered throughout the prostate&#xD;
      gland.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, open label, non-randomized, single site, phase I/II study of the&#xD;
      safety and utility of 11C-Choline PET scans for delineation of intraprostatic lesions in&#xD;
      subjects with localized intermediate risk prostate cancer and subsequent Enhanced EBRT&#xD;
      (External Beam Radiation Therapy) to monitor toxicity, therapeutic response and recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimated total number of subjects required for protocol enrollment and baseline&#xD;
      11C-Choline PET scans is 63; however, the protocol will complete accrual only when 29&#xD;
      subjects have commenced Enhanced EBRT or the outlined stopping rules require a halt to&#xD;
      accrual. Twenty-nine (29) subjects treated with Enhanced EBRT are required to assess the&#xD;
      toxicity of this treatment based on the statistical analysis outlined in the protocol.&#xD;
      Subjects will receive a fixed dose (400 MBq, 10%) of 11C-Choline and PET/CT imaging with&#xD;
      co-registration 3T MRI imaging prior to Enhanced EBRT and two further doses of 11C-Choline at&#xD;
      two intervals (3 and 6 months) thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with suitable intraprostatic lesion delineation with 11C-Choline will proceed to&#xD;
      Enhanced EBRT, consisting of a dose prescription of 78 Gy in 25 fractions to the&#xD;
      intraprostatic lesions and 68 Gy in 25 fractions (simultaneously) to the prostate gland.&#xD;
      Subjects without suitable intraprostatic lesion delineation will be treated with Cross Cancer&#xD;
      Institute standard of care EBRT and undergo follow-up for biochemical recurrence per protocol&#xD;
      to determine the prognostic value of the baseline PET findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be monitored for 11C-Choline safety and efficacy and for EBRT safety / toxicity&#xD;
      and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11C-Choline PET image intraprostatic lesion(s) will be analyzed by the relative uptake scores&#xD;
      (RUS), tumor to background ratios (T/B) and SUVmax parameters. Adequate delineation will be&#xD;
      determined by a lesion with tumor to background ration ≥2. This is defined in section 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11C-Choline PET image parameters will be correlated with other measures of progression and&#xD;
      survival including biochemical disease free survival as indicators of Enhanced EBRT response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy of 11C-Choline delineated Enhanced EBRT will be evaluated by progression and&#xD;
      survival analysis compared to historical data from this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety of 11C-Choline will be determined by: vital signs, blood hematology and clinical&#xD;
      biochemistry profile (pre-injection, post-imaging) and adverse event collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety/toxicity of 11C-Choline delineated Enhanced EBRT will be determined by adverse event&#xD;
      collection, primarily for genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity and compared to&#xD;
      historical data from this population.&#xD;
