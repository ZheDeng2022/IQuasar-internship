      A phase II non randomized study evaluating the role of Androgen Receptors as Targets for&#xD;
      therapy of pre-treated postmenopausal patients with ER/PgR-negative/AR-positive or ER and/or&#xD;
      PgR-positive/AR-positive metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Multicentric, Open-label not randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Study Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily oral administration of DHEA (Dehydroepiandrosterone) at the dosage of 100 mg/die in&#xD;
      combination with a daily oral administration of anastrozole at dosage of 1 mg/die or&#xD;
      letrozole at the dosage of 2.5 mg/die or exemestane at the dosage of 25 mg/die without&#xD;
      interruption until discontinuation for progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity or&#xD;
      discontinuation/withdrawal of participants from study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 patients per group in the first step; if the number of responders is greater or equal to&#xD;
      2, recruitment will continue up to a total of 35 patients (per group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the biological part, we will evaluate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Correlation between AR expression and clinical and biological features (tumor size,&#xD;
           nodal status, histotype, grading, proliferative index, ER, PgR, HER2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluation of AR expression on primitive and/or metastatic site in the two distinct&#xD;
           populations of patients: ER/PgR- negative/ARpositive and ER-positive and/or&#xD;
           PgR-positive/AR-positive&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluation of ER, PgR, HER2 expression on tumor cells of metastatic site (when it is&#xD;
           possible) and comparison with the same features of primitive tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. CTCs analysis in term of molecular characteristics (gene expression and mutations) and&#xD;
           functionality (vitality and tumorigenicity).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Prognostic and predictive role of Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC) evaluated at baseline&#xD;
           before study treatment and at the moment of discontinuation of treatment.&#xD;

           before study treatment and at the moment of discontinuation of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size required for each treatment arm will be predicted using a SIMON two-stage&#xD;
      design with a 10 percent alpha and beta error.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming an acceptable minimum clinical benefit P0 equal to 10 percent and an auspicious&#xD;
      clinical benefit P1 equal to 30 percent, we plan to recruit 12 patients per group in the&#xD;
      first step.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the number of responders is greater or equal to 2, recruitment will continue up to a total&#xD;
      of 35 patients (per group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the number of responders is greater or equal to 6, the combination will be considered&#xD;
      active and worthy of further evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a subgroup population is discontinued at the end of the first step, the study will be&#xD;
      continued with the other subgroup.&#xD;
