    <textblock>
      Liberal fluid administration is one of risk factors of developing acute lung injury (ALI) in&#xD;
      thoracic surgery. Therefore, the investigators try to restrain fluid administration, and in&#xD;
      the case of intraoperative hypotension, the investigators often administer vasoactive agents&#xD;
      or inotropes. One lung ventilation (OLV) which is routinely employed for thoracic surgery&#xD;
      decrease arterial oxygenation and oxygen delivery to brain can be also decreased. In this&#xD;
      study, the investigators compared dopamine and phenylephrine in respect to maintaining&#xD;
      cerebral oxygen saturation in major thoracic surgery. The investigators hypothesis is that&#xD;
      dopamine is better than phenylephrine to maintain cerebral oxygen saturation in thoracic&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

      A 'restrictive' intraoperative fluid regimen, avoiding hypovolaemia but limiting infusion to&#xD;
      the minimum necessary reduced major complications after complex surgery. This restrictive&#xD;
      fluid regimen is especially relevant in thoracic surgery since acute lung injury is known to&#xD;
      be related to large amount of fluid administration during operation to treat hypotension. One&#xD;
      study suggests that, for every 500-mL increase in perioperative fluids, there is an odds&#xD;
      ratio of 1.17 for developing ALI after lung resection. Slinger suggested that fluid should be&#xD;
      restricted just to the point of maintaining urine output of 0.5 mL/kg/h, and vasopressors may&#xD;
      be used if tissue perfusion is inadequate. Therefore, restriction of fluid administration and&#xD;
      treatment of hypotension which is not caused by major hemorrhage with vasoactive agents could&#xD;
      be a basic concept in thoracic anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who undergoing lung resection surgery usually receive one lung ventilation (OLV).&#xD;
      Decrease of systemic oxygenation occurs during OLV due to intrapulmonary shunt. During OLV,&#xD;
      significant decrease in cerebral oxygenation (SctO2) is also known to occur and low SctO2 is&#xD;
      related to postoperative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the endpoint of hemodynamic optimization is to improve oxygen delivery to major&#xD;
      organs, understanding how the administration of vasoactive agents affects cerebral perfusion&#xD;
      and oxygenation, the most important organ in the body is of major clinical relevance.&#xD;
      Recently published studies show that near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-guided brain&#xD;
      protection protocols might lead to reduced neurocognitive complications and improved&#xD;
      postoperative outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there have been no data on which agent between dopamine and phenylephrine, the most&#xD;
      commonly used aged during operation against hypotension, is better in maintaining cerebral&#xD;
      oxygen saturation during thoracic surgery. Therefore, the investigators try to compare&#xD;
      dopamine and phenylephrine continuous infusion in respect to maintaining SctO2 in major&#xD;
      thoracic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, acute kidney injury (AKI) develops in around 6% of patients after lung resection&#xD;
      surgery and AKI is related to poor prognosis and prolonged duration of hospital&#xD;
      admission.Therefore, the investigators also tried to find which agent is better to maintain&#xD;
      urinary output during operation and reduce postoperative AKI. The investigators also found&#xD;
      there is difference in postoperative delirium incidence between dopamine and phenylephrine&#xD;
      continuous infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aims of the study were (i) to investigate the effect of phenylephrine and&#xD;
      dopamine continuous infusion on cerebral SctO2 (ii) to identify the hemodynamic variables&#xD;
      [mean blood pressure, cardiac output, heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV)] which are&#xD;
      responsible for the changes in cerebral SctO2 induced by phenylephrine and dopamine&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
