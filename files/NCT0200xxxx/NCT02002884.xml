    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether injections of Botulinum toxin type A into&#xD;
      muscles of one or both arms alone or in combination with injections into one or both legs are&#xD;
      effective and safe in treating children/adolescents (age 2-17 years) with increased muscle&#xD;
      tension/uncontrollable muscle stiffness (spasticity) due to cerebral palsy.&#xD;

    <measure>MP: Change From Baseline in Ashworth Scale (AS) in UL Primary Clinical Target Pattern at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The AS categorizes severity of spasticity by judging resistance to passive movement. Spasticity was assessed by using the 5-point AS with:0 (no increase in tone); 1 (slight increase in tone giving a &quot;catch&quot; when the limb was moved in flexion or extension); 2 (more marked increase in tone, but limb easily flexed); 3 (considerable increase in tone -passive movements difficult); 4 (limb rigid in flexion or extension). Values represent least square (LS) mean differences between baseline and Week 4 resulting from Mixed Model Repeated Measurement (MMRM) models comparing high versus low and in a second step mid versus low dose groups, respectively. Values for the low group may differ slightly depending on the comparison and are therefore provided separately for each comparison.</description>

    <measure>Co-primary Variable MP: Investigator's Global Impression of Change Scale (GICS) at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The GICS was used to measure independently the investigator's impression of change due to treatment. The response option was a common 7-point Likert scale, that ranges from +3 (very much improved); +2 (much improved); +1 (minimally improved); 0 (no change); -1 (minimally worse); -2 (much worse); -3 (very much worse). Values represent LS mean differences between baseline and Week 4 resulting from ANCOVA models comparing high versus low and in a second step mid versus low dose groups, respectively. Values for the low group may differ slightly depending on the comparison and are therefore provided separately for each comparison.</description>

    <measure>MP: Change From Baseline in AS Score of the Other Treated UL Main Clinical Target Pattern at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The AS categorizes the severity of spasticity by judging resistance to passive movement. Spasticity was assessed by 5-point scale at visits, where: 0 (no increase in tone); 1(slight increase in tone giving a &quot;catch&quot; when the limb was moved in flexion or extension); 2(more marked increase in tone, but limb easily flexed); 3(considerable increase in tone - passive movements difficult); 4(limb rigid in flexion or extension). Values represent LS mean differences between baseline and Week 4 resulting from MMRM models comparing high versus low and in a second step mid versus low dose groups, respectively. Values for the low group may differ slightly depending on the comparison and are therefore provided separately for each comparison.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The AS categorizes the severity of spasticity by judging resistance to passive movement. Spasticity was assessed by 5-point scale at visits, where: 0 (no increase in tone); 1(slight increase in tone giving a &quot;catch&quot; when the limb was moved in flexion or extension); 2(more marked increase in tone, but limb easily flexed); 3(considerable increase in tone - passive movements difficult); 4(limb rigid in flexion or extension).

    <measure>MP: Change From Baseline in Scores of Pain Intensity (From Participants) and Pain Frequency (From Parent/Caregiver) Assessed With 'Questionnaire on Pain Caused by Spasticity (QPS)'</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 4, 8, and 14</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity (from participants) and pain frequency (from parent/caregiver) to be assessed with QPS. The QPS Total Score for pain intensity ranges from 0 ('No Hurt') to 10 ('Hurt Worst'). The QPS Total Score for the observed pain frequency ranges from 0 (Never) to 4 (Always). Values represent LS mean differences between baseline and Week 4 resulting from MMRM models comparing high versus low and in a second step mid versus low dose groups, respectively. Values for the low group may differ slightly depending on the comparison and are therefore provided separately for each comparison. P/C = Parent/Caregiver.</description>

          <title>MP Low Dose Group</title>
          <description>Participants in low dose group received intramuscular injections of 2 Units per kilogram (U/kg) NT 201 (maximum of 50 Units [U] in participants with greater than [&gt;] 25 kilogram [kg] body weight [BW]) into spastic muscles of one of the upper Limb (UL) on Day 1 of MP. If the contralateral UL or one or both lower limb (LL) were also treated, participants received additional doses of NT 201. The total body dose ranged from 2 U/kg (50 U for participants with &gt;25kg BW) to 5 U/kg (125 U for participants with &gt;25kg BW) depending on the combination of treated limbs and the participant's Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) level.</description>

        <title>MP: Change From Baseline in Ashworth Scale (AS) in UL Primary Clinical Target Pattern at Week 4</title>
        <description>The AS categorizes severity of spasticity by judging resistance to passive movement. Spasticity was assessed by using the 5-point AS with:0 (no increase in tone); 1 (slight increase in tone giving a &quot;catch&quot; when the limb was moved in flexion or extension); 2 (more marked increase in tone, but limb easily flexed); 3 (considerable increase in tone -passive movements difficult); 4 (limb rigid in flexion or extension). Values represent least square (LS) mean differences between baseline and Week 4 resulting from Mixed Model Repeated Measurement (MMRM) models comparing high versus low and in a second step mid versus low dose groups, respectively. Values for the low group may differ slightly depending on the comparison and are therefore provided separately for each comparison.</description>

        <title>Co-primary Variable MP: Investigator's Global Impression of Change Scale (GICS) at Week 4</title>
        <description>The GICS was used to measure independently the investigator's impression of change due to treatment. The response option was a common 7-point Likert scale, that ranges from +3 (very much improved); +2 (much improved); +1 (minimally improved); 0 (no change); -1 (minimally worse); -2 (much worse); -3 (very much worse). Values represent LS mean differences between baseline and Week 4 resulting from ANCOVA models comparing high versus low and in a second step mid versus low dose groups, respectively. Values for the low group may differ slightly depending on the comparison and are therefore provided separately for each comparison.</description>

          <title>MP: Change From Baseline in AS Score in UL Treated Clenched Fist With Flexed Wrist at Week 4</title>
          <description>The AS categorizes the severity of spasticity by judging resistance to passive movement. Spasticity was assessed by 5-point scale at visits, where: 0 (no increase in tone); 1(slight increase in tone giving a &quot;catch&quot; when the limb was moved in flexion or extension); 2(more marked increase in tone, but limb easily flexed); 3(considerable increase in tone - passive movements difficult); 4(limb rigid in flexion or extension). Values represent LS mean differences between baseline and Week 4 resulting from MMRM models comparing high versus low and in a second step mid versus low dose groups, respectively. Values for the low group may differ slightly depending on the comparison and are therefore provided separately for each comparison.</description>

        <title>MP: Change From Baseline in Scores of Pain Intensity (From Participants) and Pain Frequency (From Parent/Caregiver) Assessed With 'Questionnaire on Pain Caused by Spasticity (QPS)'</title>
        <description>Pain intensity (from participants) and pain frequency (from parent/caregiver) to be assessed with QPS. The QPS Total Score for pain intensity ranges from 0 ('No Hurt') to 10 ('Hurt Worst'). The QPS Total Score for the observed pain frequency ranges from 0 (Never) to 4 (Always). Values represent LS mean differences between baseline and Week 4 resulting from MMRM models comparing high versus low and in a second step mid versus low dose groups, respectively. Values for the low group may differ slightly depending on the comparison and are therefore provided separately for each comparison. P/C = Parent/Caregiver.</description>

The total body dose ranged from 2 U/kg (50 U for participants with &gt;25kg BW) to 5 U/kg (125 U for participants with &gt;25kg BW) depending on the combination of treated limbs and the participant's GMFCS level.</description>

        <title>MP: Child's/Adolescent's, and Parent's/Caregiver's GICS in UL at Week 4</title>
        <description>The GICS was used to measure independently the child's/adolescent's, and parent's or caregiver's impression of change due to treatment. The response option was a common 7-point Likert scale, that ranges from: +3(very much improved); +2(much improved); +1(minimally improved); 0(no change); -1(minimally worse); -2(much worse); -3(very much worse). Values represent LS mean differences between baseline and Week 4 resulting from ANCOVA models comparing high versus low and in a second step mid versus low dose groups, respectively. Values for the low group may differ slightly depending on the comparison and are therefore provided separately for each comparison.</description>
