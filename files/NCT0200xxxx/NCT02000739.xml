  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Genetic mutations associated with cancer are being discovered and new treatments are being&#xD;
      created to treat people whose cancer tumors have certain genetic mutations. Genetic&#xD;
      sequencing of a tumor can be done, and in this study that information is sent to a company&#xD;
      called &quot;N-of-One.&quot; They will match each patient's tumor's genetic profile to targeted&#xD;
      therapies. The targeted therapies may be use of FDA-approved drugs, off-label use of&#xD;
      FDA-approved drugs, or use of experimental drugs in clinical research studies open at various&#xD;
      locations in the region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to compare the length of time it takes for a tumor to grow in&#xD;
      people who receive the standard treatment for metastatic cancer to the length of time it&#xD;
      takes for a tumor to grow in people who receive a drug specifically targeted for their&#xD;
      cancer's genetic mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will do a kind of genetic testing called &quot;DNA sequencing&quot;. Everyone who takes&#xD;
      part in this trial will have genetic testing done on their cancer tumor tissue here at&#xD;
      Dartmouth. The results of the DNA sequencing will be sent to N-of-One as noted above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment participants get will depend on the results of the DNA sequencing and the&#xD;
      availability of targeted therapies that match the genetic profile of the tumor identified by&#xD;
      the DNA sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there is no genetic mutation that can be identified with current DNA sequencing,&#xD;
      participants will receive the standard treatment for metastatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there is a genetic mutation that can be identified with current DNA sequencing and a drug&#xD;
      has been developed for this mutation, participants may be able to receive that drug. If there&#xD;
      is more than one drug available, the participant and his/her oncologist will decide which is&#xD;
      the best one for the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because there are many drugs that may be used in this study, the investigator cannot advise&#xD;
      in advance whether or not the drug a participant might receive has been approved by the U.S.&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&#xD;

      Treatment with a personalized targeted therapy plan based on cancer genetics will improve&#xD;
      time to disease progression (TTP) compared to standard therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By comparing A) a patient's TTP on targeted therapy vs. B) their TTP on their most recent&#xD;
      prior therapy, investigators will minimize the variability in TTP observed across cancer&#xD;
      subtypes, and be able to enroll patients with any type of solid tumor in a statistically&#xD;
      unbiased manner. Based on the literature, investigators expect at least 35% of patients&#xD;
      treated with a genetically-informed targeted therapy to exhibit a longer progression-free&#xD;
      interval than would be expected with standard therapies. This &quot;TTP ratio&quot; for each patient is&#xD;
      calculated using the formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
      TTP ratio: (TTP on targeted therapy) / (TTP on most recent non-targeted therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
      An individual patient's benefit from genetically-informed targeted therapy is defined as a&#xD;
      TTP ratio ≥ 1.3&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Women should not be lactating or pregnant. If of childbearing age, she must have a&#xD;
             negative pregnancy test within two weeks of entry to the study and practice effective&#xD;
             birth control during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must be mentally competent and provide written informed consent for study&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumor tissue must be obtained through a clinically indicated biopsy or surgical&#xD;
             procedure, performed as standard-of-care for progression of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must consent to the use of blood, plasma, and tumor tissues for research&#xD;
