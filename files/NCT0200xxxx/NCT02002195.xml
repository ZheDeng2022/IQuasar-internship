  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elderly patients are generally underrepresented in the study populations of combination&#xD;
      chemotherapy trials. In gastric cancer patients, oxaliplatin has shown a more favorable&#xD;
      toxicity profile than cisplatin. A combination chemotherapy of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) with&#xD;
      oxaliplatin, mainly FOLFOX regimens, has been investigated in numerous phase II studies,&#xD;
      using different doses and schedules, and has shown considerable antitumor activity. Insofar&#xD;
      as toxicity is concerned, significant toxicities, including myelo-suppression and peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy, are a major issue for elderly patients. A modified FOLFOX regimen by omitting the&#xD;
      administration of bolus 5-fluorouracil have shown a good profile of activity and tolerability&#xD;
      in the elder population. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of a modified FOLFOX (m&#xD;
      FOLFOX) regimen for up to 8 cycles followed by capecitabine maintenance in elderly patients&#xD;
      with metastatic gastric cancer and presenting associated disease(s)&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although the number of deaths from gastric cancer has declined during the past, a large&#xD;
      proportion of elderly patients are primarily affected by the disease. The definition of an&#xD;
      elderly patient varies according to social and economic situations. However, in most&#xD;
      developed and developing countries, 65 or 70 years of age is a commonly used limit because of&#xD;
      the decreased role of the subject in the community and society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elderly cancer patients often suffer multiple comorbidities, take many medications, and have&#xD;
      age-associated physiological problems, such as impaired organ function and functional&#xD;
      changes, that make the selection of optimal treatment difficult. This aspect is also hampered&#xD;
      by the underrepresentation of older patients in cancer clinical trials. Elderly patients who&#xD;
      fulfill the inclusion criteria of clinical trials could experience the same advantages and&#xD;
      toxicities from chemotherapy as younger patients. In contrast to physicians' perceptions,&#xD;
      older patients do not recognize their age as an important issue for refusing trials [4].&#xD;
      Furthermore, performance status is not helpful to estimate the general condition of elderly&#xD;
      patients, and other factors regarding their functional, social, and mental status should be&#xD;
      considered [5].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the majority of gastric cancer patients are elderly, patients older than 65-70 years&#xD;
      have been often excluded from, or underrepresented in, the study populations of combination&#xD;
      chemotherapy trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is, moreover, a lack of prospective studies directly comparing the outcomes and the&#xD;
      tolerability of chemotherapy in young and elderly patients, although some data are available&#xD;
      in gastric cancer from a retrospective analysis . Trumper et al. evaluated retrospectively&#xD;
      1,080 patients who were enrolled into three randomized controlled trias assessing 5-FU-based&#xD;
      combination chemotherapy. They found that elderly patients obtained similar benefits from&#xD;
      palliative chemotherapy in terms of symptomatic response, tumor regression, and survival,&#xD;
      without increased toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In gastric cancer patients, oxaliplatin has shown a more favorable toxicity profile than&#xD;
      cisplatin . A combination chemotherapy of 5-FU with oxaliplatin, mainly FOLFOX regimens, has&#xD;
      been investigated in numerous phase II studies, using different doses and schedules, and has&#xD;
      shown considerable antitumor activity. Insofar as toxicity is concerned, significant&#xD;
      toxicities, including myelo-suppression and peripheral neuropathy, are a major issue for&#xD;
      elderly patients. When compared to standard FOLFOX schedules, both weekly and biweekly&#xD;
      reduced-dose combinations of oxaliplatin/5- FU without 5-FU bolus showed a more favorable&#xD;
      toxicity profile with lower rates of peripheral neuropathy and myelosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the palliative treatment of metastatic gastric cancer, a doublet containing oxaliplatin&#xD;
      and fluoropyrimidines could be considered as an option. Results from a prospective randomized&#xD;
      trial showed the non-inferiority of oxaliplatin, as compared to cisplatin, in the treatment&#xD;
      of advanced gastric cancer, while decreasing toxicity. Of interest, a subgroup analysis from&#xD;
      a phase III randomized trial reported significantly better results for elderly patients&#xD;
      treated with oxaliplatin as compared to cisplatin. In this trial, patients with advanced&#xD;
      gastric cancer were randomized to receive a 5-FU-based regimen with cisplatin (FLP regimen)&#xD;
      or oxaliplatin (FLO regimen). The primary endpoint of the study, PFS, was unmet; however, in&#xD;
      the subgroup of patients older than 65 years, the FLO regimen achieved improved efficacy in&#xD;
      terms of response rate, PFS, and overall survival (OS) as compared with the FLP regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous study, we used a modified FOLFOX regimen with the omission of bolus 5-FU with&#xD;
      the aim to improve tolerability of such regimen in the elderly population, while preserving&#xD;
      the outcome. This strategy was adopted based on the results of previous and ongoing studies&#xD;
      of oxaliplatin/5-FU combination regimens. We attained an overall response rate of 34.9 %,&#xD;
      which compared favorably with other phase II studies of FOLFOX chemotherapy, ranging from&#xD;
      32.2 % to 52.5 % (see Table 5). This overall response rate was noteworthy if we consider that&#xD;
      all the patients had metastatic or recurrent gastric cancer compared with other studies in&#xD;
      which a variable percentage (from 8 % to 35 %) of enrolled patients had locally advanced&#xD;
      disease. We observed no grade 4 toxicity, whereas grade 1-3 gastrointestinal toxicities were&#xD;
      reported in a moderate number of patients. The modified FOLFOX (m FOLFOX) regimen showed a&#xD;
      9.3% occurrence of grade 3 to 4 neutropenia, which is lower than reported in other studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Capecitabine monotherapy was shown an effective maintenance treatment after chemotherapy with&#xD;
      a favorable safety profile. In metastatic breast cancer, single-agent capecitabine was&#xD;
      administered at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 twice daily for 14 days, followed by a 7-day rest&#xD;
      period, every 3 weeks. Short-course XELOX followed by capecitabine maintenance therapy, at a&#xD;
      dose of 1,250 mg/m2 bid on d1-14 every 21 days until disease progression, provides an active&#xD;
      and well-tolerated treatment option for patients with previously untreated metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer. This approach minimises the risk of unwanted cumulative neurotoxicity, is&#xD;
      cheaper and more convenient for both patients and healthcare providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, fixed low-dose capecitabine (1,000 mg b.i.d.), administered continuously, has been&#xD;
      administered to patients with gastrointestinal cancers with a high level of safety.&#xD;
      Capecitabine 1,000 mg twice daily without interruption was used for the first 11 patients.&#xD;
      The dose was reduced to 1,000 mg twice daily 5 days per week in 8 patients who developed&#xD;
      hand-foot syndrome. Main toxicities were grade 1 to 2 fatigue and hand-foot syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is aimed to collect data on progression free survival (PFS) of elderly&#xD;
      population with metastatic or recurrent gastric cancer, which are treated with the modified&#xD;
      FOLFOX protocol followed by capecitabine maintenance. The aim of the present observational&#xD;
      study is to assess if maintenance with capecitabine after a fixed number (8 cycles) of m&#xD;
      FOLFOX regimen is able to prolong the PFS, with acceptable toxicity. In this case patients&#xD;
      could achieve a safe treatment, sparing unnecessary combination-related toxicity (e.g.&#xD;
      neurotoxicity, neutropenia, diarrhea and mucositis).&#xD;
