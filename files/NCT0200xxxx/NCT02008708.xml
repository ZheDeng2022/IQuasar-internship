    <textblock>
      The objective is to test the effectiveness of a village-led microfinance program, Pigs for&#xD;
      Peace, on health, household economic stability, and reintegration of trauma survivors to&#xD;
      family and community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The five-year experimental trial will use mixed-methods to address the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the effectiveness of a village-led microfinance program on participants health&#xD;
           and reintegration in intervention households compared to participants in delayed control&#xD;
           households. Health and reintegration will be measured at baseline and six, twelve, and&#xD;
           18-months post-baseline using self-report in both intervention and delayed control&#xD;
           groups. We hypothesize that at six, twelve and 18 months post-baseline participants in&#xD;
           intervention households will have improved health and increased reintegration to&#xD;
           families in comparison to participants in control households.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the effectiveness of a village-led microfinance program on household economic&#xD;
           stability in intervention households compared to delayed control villages. Household&#xD;
           economic stability will be measured at baseline and six, twelve and 18 months post-&#xD;
           baseline using self-report in both intervention and control households. We hypothesize&#xD;
           that at six, twelve and 18-months post-baseline the intervention households will have&#xD;
           improved household economic stability in comparison to control households.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examine the role of a village-led microfinance program on village-level health,&#xD;
           economics, stigma and reintegration of survivors and their families in intervention and&#xD;
           delayed control villages. Village members (n=5 in each village, n=50 total) will&#xD;
           complete a baseline and 18 month post-baseline qualitative interview to examine the role&#xD;
           of microfinance on village-level health, economics, stigma and reintegration in both&#xD;
           intervention and control households.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mobutu Sese Seko's government of &quot;Kleptocracy&quot; collapsed in 1997 after 30 years of&#xD;
      oppression. The new nation that emerged, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), remains an&#xD;
      all-to-potent reminder of how human rights violations, and their related health and economic&#xD;
      impacts, can devastate individuals, families and communities. The genocide in neighboring&#xD;
      Rwanda, coupled with the collapse of the Mobutu government, has spawned two wars and over a&#xD;
      decade of warfare throughout the region, resulting in millions of deaths in what is the&#xD;
      deadliest conflict since World War II 1. The last decade has seen the use of rape as a weapon&#xD;
      of war in the DRC, where rebels and soldiers subject women, men and children to brutalizing&#xD;
      attacks, rape, torture, and mutilation. Survivors of the assault are often further&#xD;
      traumatized by infections, disease, poverty, stigma and social isolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The US plays a significant role in global health. It is both the largest funder of innovation&#xD;
      in global health and the largest donor to care and support programs in sub-Saharan&#xD;
      Africa-notably through The US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and&#xD;
      responses to humanitarian crisis, such as USAID funded programs in DRC. The effectiveness and&#xD;
      sustainability of these efforts are limited by gaps in knowledge of the role of social&#xD;
      determinants, such as poverty, social isolation, chronic stress and trauma, and limited&#xD;
      access to health care services has on the health of women and families. To begin to address&#xD;
      these gaps, our overall goal is to build the science base for large-scale implementation of&#xD;
      economic programs to improve the health of survivors of trauma living in man-made and natural&#xD;
      disaster settings.&#xD;

    <description>10 villages in rural South Kivu province of DRC will be selected for participation. Sixty-100 households in each village will then be randomized to intervention (receive 1st loan pig) and delayed control (receive offspring from loan pig) groups.&#xD;
Outcome will be measured in both intervention and control villages.&#xD;
Measurement of outcome will use self-report by participating household member.&#xD;
An eligible participant is an adult head of household at least 16 years or older.</description>
