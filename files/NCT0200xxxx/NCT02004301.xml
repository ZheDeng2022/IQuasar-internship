  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, open-label, non-randomised, two-arm study in 12 healthy male&#xD;
      volunteers. This study is designed to correlate the gastrointestinal transit behaviour of&#xD;
      delayed-release diclofenac potassium tablets with their pharmacokinetic (PK) absorption&#xD;
      profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will be looking at:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The behaviour of the tablets (when, where and how quickly they break up)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The gastric emptying time of the tablets (when they leave the stomach)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The gastrointestinal transit of the tablets (how long they take to travel through the&#xD;
           gut)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Blood levels of the drug (diclofenac)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The tablets being tested will contain the drug, diclofenac potassium. Diclofenac potassium is&#xD;
      a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) taken to reduce inflammation and as an&#xD;
      analgesic, reducing pain in certain conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, gout and&#xD;
      post-operative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 2 treatments are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tablet T4: Radiolabelled delayed release diclofenac potassium tablet with time delay of 4 h&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tablet T6: Radiolabelled delayed release diclofenac potassium tablet with time delay of 6 h&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we will be using a type of radioactive material (known as technetium-99m) which&#xD;
      is routinely used in investigations of this type. A small amount of technetium-99m will be&#xD;
      put into each tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective A)To assess the site and time of onset and complete release of radiolabel&#xD;
      from two delayed-release diclofenac potassium formulations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives B)To determine gastrointestinal transit parameters of two&#xD;
      delayed-release diclofenac potassium formulations C)To determine the plasma concentrations of&#xD;
      diclofenac at each PK sampling point post-administration of two delayed-release diclofenac&#xD;
      potassium formulations D)To assess and compare between the two delayed-release diclofenac&#xD;
      potassium formulations, as a minimum, the following PK parameters: tlag, tmax, Cmax and&#xD;
      AUC0-15h&#xD;
