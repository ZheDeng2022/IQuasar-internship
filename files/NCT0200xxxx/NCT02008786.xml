  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An emerging cause of heart attack in young women is a dissection (or tear) in the coronary&#xD;
      arteries. Many of these young women continue to have chest pain long after the tear has&#xD;
      healed and this is thought to be due to problems with their small blood vessels of the heart&#xD;
      (or microcirculation). We want to determine whether commonly used medications for coronary&#xD;
      artery disease including statins (for cholesterol) and angiotensin-converting enzyme&#xD;
      inhibitors (for blood pressure) reduce chest pain and improve small vessel function in these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD), many continue to have ongoing&#xD;
      signs and symptoms of ischemia after the dissection has healed. Further, 1 in 5 women will&#xD;
      experience recurrent SCAD in long-term follow-up. To date, no study has investigated the&#xD;
      pathophysiologic mechanism behind ongoing symptoms or recurrence of SCAD, but microvascular&#xD;
      coronary dysfunction (MCD) has been suggested. Coronary reactivity testing (CRT) is an&#xD;
      invasive procedure currently being done in MCD patients as the gold standard technique. In&#xD;
      particular, a coronary flow reserve (CFR) &lt; 2.5 has been shown to be both diagnostic of the&#xD;
      condition and prognostic of a 2 fold increased risk of cardiac events. Please see below for a&#xD;
      detailed description of CRT. In brief, a dual temperature and pressure sensor tipped wire by&#xD;
      Radi Medical Systems (St Jude Medical, St Paul, MN) will be placed into the dissected and&#xD;
      non-dissected coronary arteries of the patient. This will measure CFR by thermodilution and&#xD;
      will also allow the measurement of the index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR). IMR has&#xD;
      been found to correlate well with true microvascular resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to a lack of diagnostic strategies, there is a paucity of research into&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies. Most women are conservatively managed with medications, however,&#xD;
      there is no consensus as to which pharmacologic therapies should be used. Case reports have&#xD;
      suggested benefit with antiplatelet agents (e.g. aspirin) and beta-blockers (reduction of&#xD;
      arterial wall shear stress). To date no study has investigated the effects of statins or&#xD;
      Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEIs) in SCAD patients. Both agents have been&#xD;
      studied in the MCD population and been found to reduce angina frequency and improve CFR after&#xD;
      16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measuring the CFR and IMR in 40 SCAD patients with ongoing chest pain who are at least 3&#xD;
      months from their dissection to determine the proportion with microvascular dysfunction and&#xD;
      to investigate prospectively whether the addition of an ACEI or a statin to usual care in&#xD;
      patients with ongoing chest pain and a CFR &lt;3.0 improves chest pain frequency by Seattle&#xD;
      Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) at 16 weeks compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the average CFR in patients at least 3 months out from their SCAD will be&#xD;
      &lt;2.5 and that their IMR will be abnormal. Further, we hypothesize that the addition of either&#xD;
      an ACEI and/or statin will improve chest pain frequency by at least 20 points on the SAQ at&#xD;
      16 weeks compared to placebo.&#xD;
