      The purpose of this study is to compare attitudes and knowledge of the staff of various&#xD;
      departments in our Medical Center in regards to pain treatment. With the results of our&#xD;
      survey we will then draw up a protocol on pain management.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our belief is that the establishment of a pain protocol at the Ziv Medical Center will&#xD;
      improve effectiveness of pain treatment. The present study involves surveying the current&#xD;
      knowledge and attitudes of caregivers who are responsible for evaluating pain in patients and&#xD;
      subsequent treatment in various departments of the hospital without a pain protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the IASP (International Association for the Study of Pain) :&quot; Pain is an&#xD;
      unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue&#xD;
      damage, or described in terms of such damage&quot;. According to WHO, assessment is necessary in&#xD;
      every situation that involves pain, excluding pain that is life threatening. Valid and&#xD;
      reliable assessment is essential for effective pain management. The very nature of pain makes&#xD;
      it impossible to measure objectively. There are different types of pain, and as caregivers,&#xD;
      we need to diagnose the pain accurately in order that each patient gets the most effective&#xD;
      treatment and continued evaluations, as needed. When caregivers decide on a treatment for&#xD;
      pain, they are relying on the relatively objective VAS (Visual Analogue Scale.) According to&#xD;
      recent studies most patients were dissatisfied with the pain treatment they had received.&#xD;
      Approximately eighty percent of patients who present to emergency departments worldwide come&#xD;
      because of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Often the patient and the caregiver have different ideas about what pain is and how to treat&#xD;
      it. Cultural differences, gender differences, even age differences may affect reactions of&#xD;
      both the caretaker and the patient. There are many ways to treat pain, and various reasons&#xD;
      for how people react to pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is designed to measure the knowledge and attitudes of caregivers and in&#xD;
      regard to the pain of their patients. An assessment of patient satisfaction to pain&#xD;
      management will be also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staff members working in wards involved with pain will be asked to fill out anonymous&#xD;
      questionnaires concerning knowledge and attitudes toward pain. Patients will also be asked to&#xD;
      fill out anonymous questionnaires in regard to their pain treatment. Informed consent will be&#xD;
      requested. Responses will be collated and recorded. A future study is planned using a new&#xD;
      pain protocol. The questionnaires will be repeated after the protocol has been in place for&#xD;
      12 months, at which time responses will be compared.&#xD;
