  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurologic complications after cardiac surgery range over a wide spectrum including&#xD;
      postoperative delirium (PD), postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) and cerebrovascular&#xD;
      accidents (CVA). The incidence of these neurologic events varies depending on the type of&#xD;
      surgery and the population studied. The incidence of PD and/or POCD is further influenced by&#xD;
      the type of the neurologic tests used. Moreover, the timing of these tests seems to influence&#xD;
      the results. Intraoperative cerebral monitoring is gaining importance in the anesthesia&#xD;
      field. Recent findings have pointed out that cerebral hypoperfusion on one hand and deep&#xD;
      levels of anesthesia on the other hand are major sources of adverse neurological outcomes,&#xD;
      both of which can be detected with different non-invasive cerebral monitors.The present&#xD;
      investigators are currently using the NeuroSENSE®, a processed electroencephalogram (pEEG)&#xD;
      monitor together with cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) on a daily basis in every&#xD;
      cardiac patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This large, prospective, observational study will investigate whether the short- and mid-term&#xD;
      neurologic outcome of adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery are in line with observations&#xD;
      made on the basis of the pEEG monitor NeuroSENSE® and cerebral NIRS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Whilst the incidence and the perioperative management of neurological complications after&#xD;
      cardiac surgery may vary, they share some common risk factors for their occurrence: advanced&#xD;
      age, cardiovascular morbidity including peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, previous&#xD;
      stroke, preoperative cognitive impairment and dementia.As most of these factors are not&#xD;
      modifiable at the time of surgery, conditions that can be controlled in the perioperative&#xD;
      period should deserve more focus to prevent the occurrence of neurological problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative cerebral hypoperfusion is generally accepted as a worsening factor of&#xD;
      neurological complications.Besides hypoperfusion states, an overdose of general anesthetics&#xD;
      is among intraoperative factors that have been evoked to influence postoperative neurological&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this study is to know the incidence of POCD and PD in cardiac surgical&#xD;
      population and to seek whether the presence and the duration of burst suppressions as&#xD;
      detected by NeuroSENSE® on one hand and episodes of cerebral desaturation as detected by&#xD;
      bilateral cerebral NIRS on the other hand are risk factors to develop these complications.&#xD;
      The magnitude of burst suppression will be recorded as total Area Under the Curve (AUC) of&#xD;
      burst suppression of each hemisphere. Cerebral desaturation is defined as AUC of 25% drop of&#xD;
      oximetry values as compared to the preinduction values for each hemisphere. We will evaluate&#xD;
      whether the concomitant presence of burst suppression together with cerebral oximetry&#xD;
      desaturation can predict POCD and PD. Our study will be the first to analyze this point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Otherwise, with this study the investigators will look for any eventual agreement between the&#xD;
      cerebral NIRS and the NeuroSENSE® monitor in terms of detecting cerebral abnormalities.&#xD;
      Lastly, in line with previous observations, the investigators will actively look for any&#xD;
      intraoperative EEG abnormalities and in particular any sustained pEEG asymmetry that appears&#xD;
      together with burst suppressions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the study is observational any frontal severe EEG asymmetry together with the&#xD;
      appearance of burst suppression will be carefully evaluated by an experienced&#xD;
      anesthesiologist in reading and interpreting processed EEG monitor. The case will be&#xD;
      discussed on an multidisciplinary basis and an eventual CT scan will be performed.In the&#xD;
      absence of hemorrhage and if large cerebral vessel occlusion is identified, a catheter&#xD;
      angiography with an eventual thrombectomy will be realized with the aim to extract the clot.&#xD;
