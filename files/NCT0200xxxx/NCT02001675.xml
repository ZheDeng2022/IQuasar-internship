  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) has emerged as a suitable tool for restoring,&#xD;
      maintaining and/or enhancing muscular performance. From a practical point of view, NMES can&#xD;
      elicit contractions either by direct activation of motor axons (i.e. peripheral mechanism) or&#xD;
      by the recruitment of motoneurons in the spinal cord through the depolarization of sensory&#xD;
      axons (central mechanism). It is noteworthy that NMES parameters widely affect the balance&#xD;
      between transmission along these two pathways. Conventional NMES is usually delivered using&#xD;
      short pulse duration (0.05-0.4 ms), low stimulation frequency (15-40 Hz) and high stimulus&#xD;
      intensities so that the large antidromic volley in motor axons ensures that the evoked&#xD;
      contraction will be driven largely by the direct depolarization of motor axons beneath the&#xD;
      stimulation site with no or little involvement of central nervous system. On the contrary,&#xD;
      when NMES is delivered using wide pulse widths (1 ms) and high frequency (up to 100 Hz)&#xD;
      (WP-HF NMES), a portion of the evoked contraction arises from a central mechanism and the&#xD;
      corresponding force (recently referred to as &quot;extra force&quot;) is significantly (three times)&#xD;
      larger than the conventional NMES-induced force. This extra force is supposed to represent&#xD;
      the central contribution from the recruitment of spinal motoneurons by the evoked afferent&#xD;
      volley given that no additional force was observed during a complete anesthetic block of the&#xD;
      nerve proximal to the stimulation site. Despite the obvious differences in terms of&#xD;
      activation of the neuromuscular system between conventional and WP-HF NMES, the functional,&#xD;
      metabolic and cortical responses associated to both protocols remain to be determined&#xD;

      The main goal of the project will be to characterize the evoked-force profile during&#xD;
      conventional and WP-HF NMES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary purpose will be to i) investigate the anatomic and metabolic responses of the&#xD;
      human calf muscle following both NMES protocols by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and&#xD;
      31-phosphorous magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS-P31), ii) study the cortical responses&#xD;
      for both conditions of stimulation by means of functional MRI (f-MRI).&#xD;
