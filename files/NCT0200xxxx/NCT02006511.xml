  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wound complications associated with surgical incisions range from minor to life threatening.&#xD;
      Surgical site infections occurring usually occur within 30 days and are one of the most&#xD;
      common surgical complications. Perigraft infections in groin wounds can be devastating. Even&#xD;
      superficial wounds can progress to deep wounds resulting in graft infection, need for&#xD;
      explantation, and sepsis or amputation requirement. Negative pressure wound therapy has had&#xD;
      favorable results on closed wounds in trauma populations. Similarly, negative pressure wound&#xD;
      therapy has had positive benefits in closed incisions such as sternal wounds following&#xD;
      cardiac surgery. As a result, the PrevenaTM Incision Management System(IMS) was developed to&#xD;
      allow easier application of negative pressure therapy to closed wounds. Application of the&#xD;
      PrevenaTM IMS dressing would portend the aforementioned benefits of Vacuum Assisted Closure&#xD;
      (VAC®) therapy with the added benefits of protecting the wound from contamination and&#xD;
      bolstering the wound edges for better approximation and consequently better aesthetic&#xD;
      outcome. However, no comparison between negative pressure therapy as a dressing and standard&#xD;
      wound dressings exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of topical negative pressure&#xD;
      therapy application with Prevena™ versus standard of care wound therapy on closed groin&#xD;
      incisions in high risk patients undergoing vascular surgery.&#xD;
