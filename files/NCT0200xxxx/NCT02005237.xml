  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive dysfunction is frequent in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and to date, there&#xD;
      are no available treatments to improve cognition in this patient population. Some evidence&#xD;
      from animal studies and small clinical trials suggest that aerobic exercise might&#xD;
      beneficially affect cognitive function in MS. The aim of this randomized-controlled trial is&#xD;
      to explore if an aerobic exercise training program can enhance cognition in MS. In addition,&#xD;
      we will employ neuroimaging markers to determine if exercise alters measures of brain&#xD;
      structure and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned to either a 3-months exercise program (bicycle ergometry,&#xD;
      2-3 session per week) or a waitlist control group. The primary endpoint of the study is a&#xD;
      test of verbal learning and memory. Secondary endpoints include neuroimaging markers of&#xD;
      functional and structural connectivity in the brain. We hypothesize that exercise will&#xD;
      improve verbal learning and memory and beneficially affect measures of brain connectivity.&#xD;

      Background: Cognitive dysfunction is frequent in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and to&#xD;
      date, there are no available treatments to improve cognition in this patient population. Some&#xD;
      evidence from animal studies and small clinical trials suggest that aerobic exercise might&#xD;
      beneficially affect cognitive function in MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: This study aims to explore the potential of an aerobic exercise program on brain&#xD;
      structure and function in MS in a single-blind, randomized controlled phase IIa trial. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that exercise will improve verbal learning and memory (primary endpoint) as well&#xD;
      as induce changes in neuroimaging markers of structural and functional central nervous system&#xD;
      (CNS) connectivity (secondary endpoints). Tertiary outcomes will include walking ability,&#xD;
      motor function and coordination, as well as patient-based outcomes (depression, fatigue, and&#xD;
      health-related quality of life).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a single-blind, randomized, controlled phase IIa trial with a parallel group&#xD;
      design comparing 3 months of standardized aerobic exercise training (bicycle ergometry) to a&#xD;
      waitlist control group (superiority framework). The allocation ratio of exercise to waitlist&#xD;
      control is 1:1 with a sample size of n=60.&#xD;
