  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is able to cause lipid metabolism and glucose&#xD;
      homeostasis alterations, which are associated to the redistribution of body fat. Alterations&#xD;
      in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism contribute to the development of a highly atherogenic&#xD;
      profile, which together with altered fibrinolysis markers and increased presence of&#xD;
      proinflammatory cytokines in blood (especially tumor necrosis factor alpha) that comes&#xD;
      associated to the success of HAART can cause the development of accelerated atherosclerosis.&#xD;
      Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a polyunsaturated fatty acid that has demonstrated its ability&#xD;
      to reduce triglyceride levels; modify cholesterol fractions and increase the size of LDL&#xD;
      particles thereby configuring less atherogenic plasma profile. Additionally, administration&#xD;
      of DHA has shown antiinflammatory and hypotensive activity, which contributes to reduce the&#xD;
      risk of cardiovascular complications in these patients. At a molecular level, DHA acts as a&#xD;
      stimulator of the nuclear receptor PPAR-gamma, which has been described to induce an increase&#xD;
      in adipocyte differentiation. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory effects induced by DHA, can&#xD;
      decrease the elevated levels of TNF-alpha, which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      body fat redistribution in HIV infected patients undergoing HAART. Therefore, the hypothesis&#xD;
      of this project is that DHA will be able to produce lipid-lowering, anti-inflammatory,&#xD;
      hypotensive and profibrinolytic effects, which all together should improve atherogenic&#xD;
      profile of patients with HIV-1 infection receiving HAART. In addition, their proprieties as&#xD;
      PPAR agonist can improve the redistribution of body fat present in many of these patients.&#xD;
      The study of the activity of DHA on dendritic cells and monocytes should indicate the absence&#xD;
      of immunosuppressive effect of DHA in the context of HIV-1 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, DHA is a natural product, from the omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, the&#xD;
      therapeutic properties of which have been described in recent years and has shown&#xD;
      cardio-vascular and metabolic beneficial effects, without recognized side effects. The highly&#xD;
      purified DHA administration at high doses could be able to reverse, at least partially, lipid&#xD;
      abnormalities associated with HAART and to exert a beneficial effect on fat redistribution in&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients treated with HAART. To ensure non deleterious immunological treat in&#xD;
      these sensitive poly-medicated patients, substantial changes in the functionality of&#xD;
      dendritic cells and monocytic will be studied.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: DHA treatment would be able to revert, at least partially, the lipid disturbances&#xD;
      associated with HAART and to improve or at least not to worse fat redistribution associated&#xD;
      with HAART, without inducing further derangements to dendritic cells and monocyte functional&#xD;
      ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables: effects of DHA treatment on total cholesterol and its fractions, triglycerides,&#xD;
      insulin, fibrinolysis markers, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and fat distribution&#xD;
      assessed by anthropometric measurements, bioimpedance, sonography, DEXA and abdominal CT.&#xD;
      Effects of DHA administration on phenotype and functional capabilities of dendritic and&#xD;
      mononuclear cells. Objective: To determine if treatment with high doses of highly purified&#xD;
      docosahexanoic acid (DHA) is able to revert, totally or partly, the lipid disturbances and&#xD;
      the fat redistribution associated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and the&#xD;
      effects on phenotype and function of dendritic cells and monocytes Data analysis: Baseline&#xD;
      data will be analyzed for a good balance. Fisher´s exact test will be used to assess&#xD;
      differences between categorical variables, Student's t test for continuous variables, and&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney test for ordinal variables. The main efficacy variable will be differences&#xD;
      between baseline and final values using MANCOVA model taking baseline value as covariable.&#xD;
      Efficacy will be assessed by contrasting adjusted means at the end of the study between both&#xD;
      groups of treatment. Intention to treat analysis will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methodology to perform in the centers where the clinical trail will be conducted are the&#xD;
      following: After obtaining informed consent, the patient's baseline will be examined with the&#xD;
      collection of demographic data, HIV infection status, pharmacological data, anthropometric&#xD;
      parameters, and it will proceed to conduct a complementary examination designed to identify&#xD;
      and define body fat composition, body fat distribution and to perform a basal analysis&#xD;
      including the parameters previously mentioned. It also will be evaluated the&#xD;
      hygienic-dietetic habits of the patient with special attention to alcohol intake, physical&#xD;
      activity and concomitant medication. This procedure will be carried out by making&#xD;
      retrospective diaries from the last 7 days. The patient's daily caloric intake will be&#xD;
      quantified by the Nutrilogic ® software (Bio Logic, Barcelona, España). Physical activity&#xD;
      will be quantified by the Minnesota scale (Elosua R, Marrugat J, Molina L, Pons S, The&#xD;
      MARATHOM Investigators. Validation of the Minnesota leisure time physical activity&#xD;
      questionnaire in Spanish men. Am J Epidemiol 1994, 139: 1197-1209).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body fat composition and body fat distribution: will be done with the following additional&#xD;
      tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Densitometry or DEXA: Will be determined with the patient in supine position with legs&#xD;
      straight and feet together, on a standardized examination table from a densitometry device&#xD;
      (Lunar Prodigy, Madison, WI, USA). In the initial study enerarán more faces of the different&#xD;
      regions that will be copied and transferred to the images of subsequent studies to reduce the&#xD;
      variability of successive determinations. There will be performed a body fat measurement,&#xD;
      body composition and assessment of bone mineral density by dual absorptiometry technique.&#xD;
      There will be performed a total body &quot;scan&quot; (body composition) or focused on lumbar spine&#xD;
      (trabecular bone) and proximal third of the femur (cortical bone) for the evaluation in the&#xD;
      last two cases of bone mineral density and a possible osteopenia or osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abdominal CT: Will be obtained by performing a spinal digital radiography, latero-lateral&#xD;
      view, locating L4 and getting a tomographic section passing through the center of the&#xD;
      vertebral body. Subsequently, there will be a digital calculation of intra-abdominal fat and&#xD;
      subcutaneous fat, manually selecting the area of interest. The areas measured will be done in&#xD;
      cm2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lab analysis: blood samples for biochemical determinations will be obtained in Vacutainer&#xD;
      tubes of 10 ml without additives. Blood will be clotted at room temperature for 30 minutes&#xD;
      and centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 15 minutes. After separating the serum from the clot (about&#xD;
      4-5 ml), will be divided into 1 aliquot of 1.5 ml (for the study of lipids) and 5-7 aliquots&#xD;
      of 0.5 ml aliquots which will be frozen at -20 °C until the biochemical analysis are carried&#xD;
      out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma lipids, glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, insulin and C-peptide: measurements of total&#xD;
      cholesterol and triglycerides will be performed using automated trading methods (enzyme&#xD;
      colorimetry, Roche Diagnostics) adapted to the automated autoanalyzer Hitachi 911. The&#xD;
      determination of apolipoproteins AI, B and C-III, lipoprotein (a) will be held mediate&#xD;
      commercial methods (immunoturbidimetric assay, Roche Diagnostics and Wako Chemicals) adapted&#xD;
      to the automated autoanalyzer Hitachi 911. The determination of cholesterol lipoprotein&#xD;
      fractions (Lipid, ELIP) (VLDL, LDL, HDL) will be performed by the following methods: VLDL&#xD;
      separated by ultracentrifugation of flotation, cholesterol HDL determined by a direct method&#xD;
      (Roche Diagnostics) and cholesterol LDL determined by difference in total cholesterol and&#xD;
      VLDL and HDL cholesterol fractions. Glucose: by a commercial method (enzyme colorimetry,&#xD;
      Roche Diagnostics) adapted to the automated autoanalyzer Hitachi 747. Serum insulin&#xD;
      concentration will be determined by non-competitive chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay&#xD;
      (Immulite 2000TM, Diagnostic Products Corp., Los Angeles, CA, USA). The serum concentration&#xD;
      of C-peptide is determined by non-competitive chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (Immulite&#xD;
      2000TM, Diagnostic Products Corp., Los Angeles, CA, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determining the size of LDL particles: The size of LDL particles will be determined from&#xD;
      total plasma using acrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions.&#xD;
      Will be used a standard of four known LDL diameter bands, previously determined by electron&#xD;
      microscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of fatty acids in plasma: Treatment compliance will be corroborated by&#xD;
      determining the fatty acid composition of plasma lipids by gas chromatography. Plasma total&#xD;
      lipids will be extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer with chloroform: methanol (2:1, V:&#xD;
      V). Methyl esters of fatty acids will be obtained by transesterification with boron&#xD;
      trifluoride in methanol at 80 °C for 60 min. which allows a high recovery of all the lipidic&#xD;
      compounds including PUFAs. Aliquot containing the methyl esters of fatty acids will be&#xD;
      analyzed with a gas chromatography device (Hewlett-Packard model 5890) on a 30 m. RTX-2330&#xD;
      column (Restek, Bellefonte, PA) with an internal diameter of 0.25 mm equipped with a flame&#xD;
      ionization detector. The carrier gas will be helium at a pressure of 105 kPa. To the total&#xD;
      separation of the different compounds it has provided with two temperature settings: 140&#xD;
      °C-200 °C to 3 °C/min or in two stages of 140°C-180°C to 4°C/min and 180°C-210°C at 2°C/min.&#xD;
      The temperature of the injector and detector is 260 °C. The linear response of the detector&#xD;
      will be tested periodically with standard mixtures. Typically, two internal standards with&#xD;
      different molecular weight (13:0 and 23:0 or 27:0) will be used. Peaks will be integrated&#xD;
      with an integrator D-2500 (Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo) and identified by comparison of retention&#xD;
      times with standards. When necessary, the identification may be confirmed by mass&#xD;
      spectrometry (Hewlett-Packard detector model 5970B) at an ionization potential of 70 eV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study of markers of inflammation: blood will be withdrawn in 5 ml EDTA tube. After&#xD;
      extraction, the tube will be centrifuged, and plasma collected in eppendorf tubes and frozen&#xD;
      at -70°C until cytokines determination. The content of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6 in the&#xD;
      plasma samples will be measured by ELISA. Each sample will be analyzed in duplicate using&#xD;
      ELISA kits &quot;R &amp; D Systems&quot; following the specifications that commercial supplier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Patients will be randomized to one of two treatment groups (placebo and DHA),&#xD;
      using a centralized randomization list. The study will be conducted according to the&#xD;
      double-blind trial methodology, in which neither the patient nor the physician are unaware of&#xD;
      the active substance administered to the patients. The randomization procedure will be&#xD;
      performed assigning either strategy according to a randomization scheme generated by the&#xD;
      module PROC PLAN SAS (version 8.2) in multiple of 2 blocks and following a pattern 1:1&#xD;
      stratified by center. A list of random assignment will generated according to the above&#xD;
      mentioned, and as from the same will be issued a sealed opaque envelope, identified by a&#xD;
      sequential number and the name of the center. The envelopes shall be deposited in the center&#xD;
      of central data management and analysis, which will act as coordinator of the centralized&#xD;
      randomization assignment by telephone contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated for inclusion in the study, and their personal data collected in a&#xD;
      specific collection data notebook. After the informed consent procedure and if the patient&#xD;
      consents to be included in the study, the centralized randomization assignment center will be&#xD;
      contacted. When patient data are registered, the envelope will be opened and the strategy&#xD;
      assigned to the patient reported to the investigator. The procedure shall be transcribed into&#xD;
      a document contained in the envelope, signing and dating this register the person responsible&#xD;
      at the central randomization center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Capsules with identical external appearance containing oleic acid (placebo) and&#xD;
      docosahexaenoic acid at doses of 500 mg per capsule will be previously prepared. The capsules&#xD;
      are coated with a protective cover which makes it taste imperceptible to the patient. The&#xD;
      dosage of DHA will be of 4 g daily. At the same intervals, patients in the placebo group will&#xD;
      take 4 g daily of oleic acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: The data of patients will be collected by a physician devoted entirely to&#xD;
      guide patients, coordinating tests to perform, and recording information into a database.&#xD;
      Data will be collected in a previously designed specific collection data notebook.&#xD;
&#xD;
      o Sample size assessment to specify the number of participants or participant years necessary&#xD;
      to demonstrate an effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimating sample size and data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected to be able to show a difference in favor of the active treatment in the main&#xD;
      variable, namely, reduction in triglycerides values at the end of the follow-up period (48&#xD;
      weeks) of at least 20% in magnitude, in the comparison of the means adjusted by a covariance&#xD;
      analysis. According to the estimated standard deviation of 86 from our own data, consistent&#xD;
      with literature data (AIDS 1999, 13:1424-1425), and the magnitude of the minimum effect&#xD;
      pre-defined as relevant (20% reduction), it would be enough to some 29 evaluable patients per&#xD;
      group. It is intended to recruit more patients as forecast of possible expected losses of&#xD;
      about 10%, or in other words, 33 subjects per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Re-estimation of the sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since variability is estimated from data from other situations (pre-treatment baseline data),&#xD;
      and there is no concrete data on the experimental situation (variability after DHA&#xD;
      treatment), it is predefined in this protocol to perform a re-estimation of the sample size&#xD;
      when will be obtained a follow up of the 50% after 4 weeks of treatment of the triglycerides&#xD;
      values. To this objective data from the main variable, triglyceride levels at baseline and&#xD;
      after 4 weeks post-treatment, along with the random assignment but masking the codes will be&#xD;
      provided to a second independent statistical group (Catalan Institute of Oncology, Department&#xD;
      of Epidemiology and Cancer Registration. Statistician: Dr. Victor Moreno) respect to central&#xD;
      statistical analysis of this study (Laboratory of Biostatistics and Epidemiology (LBE),&#xD;
      Section Clinical Trials, Autonomous University of Barcelona. Statistician: Dr. Ferran&#xD;
      Torres). This new group will perform the analysis, and will only reveal variability data to&#xD;
      recalculate the sample size. If the sample size were less than expected, it will be&#xD;
      maintained according to the initial design. Under no circumstances significance tests will be&#xD;
      performed or the study will be prematurely stopped secondarily to re-estimate variability.&#xD;
      According to this method, you do not need any adjustment of multiplicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      o Plan for missing data to address situations where variables are reported as missing,&#xD;
      unavailable, &quot;non-reported,&quot; uninterpretable, or considered missing because of data&#xD;
      inconsistency or out-of-range results Treatment of missing values&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main analysis by intention to treat will require using all subjects without relevant&#xD;
      deviations from the selection criteria, whom they have taken at least one dose of the studied&#xD;
      medication and who have evaluation of the main variable prospectively, at least at three&#xD;
      months of the follow up. Under this assumption, it is expected that in a 1-year study follow&#xD;
      up find subjects with measurements not made. Therefore it is set out the imputation of&#xD;
      missing values of the main variable as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the lack of data is due to problems of efficiency, or the cause is unknown, shall be&#xD;
           attributed the 95% percentile value for the study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In case of missing data for other reasons, will be implemented the LOCF (Last&#xD;
           Observation Carried Forward) method provided the availability of a value of at least&#xD;
           three months after its baseline measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The detailed procedure will be included in the statistical report and it is planed evaluate&#xD;
      the consistency of the method before closing the database at a meeting at which anonymous&#xD;
      listings will be facilitated for its evaluation 'Blind Review' where the procedure may be&#xD;
      re-evaluated (CPMP/EWP/1776/99: Points to Consider on Missing Data).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Difficulties and limitations of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of patients and the peculiar management that they will have, due to the additional&#xD;
      tests performed, make the study inevitably complex. However, there will be a physician who&#xD;
      permanently coordinates all patients and all tests performed. In addition, the research team&#xD;
      is wide with concrete and synergistic functions for each researcher. Finally, researchers&#xD;
      constitute a consolidated group and are experienced in previous studies with similar&#xD;
      requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      o Statistical analysis plan describing the analytical principles and statistical techniques&#xD;
      to be employed in order to address the primary and secondary objectives, as specified in the&#xD;
      study protocol or plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Descriptive analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following descriptive indexes will be detailed in the statistical report according with&#xD;
      the nature of the variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In continuous variables: Mean, CI 95%, SD, minimum, P25, median, P75, max, N and&#xD;
           missing. Per group and globally.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In categorical variables: % total with respect to the column, N in each category. Per&#xD;
           group and globally.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In ordinal variables: They will be described with two tables: one with descriptive&#xD;
           parameters of the continuous variables and the other with categorical variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In open fields or when are interested to list all cases for one or more variables, will be&#xD;
      described by lists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inferential analysis The statistical treatment of the primary and secondary efficacy&#xD;
      variables will be specifically described in a section below. For all other variables, the&#xD;
      appropriate hypothesis test will be applied according to its nature: Fisher exact test for&#xD;
      categorical variables, the Student t test for continuous variables, Mann-Whitney U test for&#xD;
      ordinal variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basal homogeneity between groups An analysis of the baseline comparability of treatment&#xD;
      groups will be established regarding demographic variables, risk factors and clinical&#xD;
      characteristics at the time of inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main efficacy analysis The main variable of efficacy will be evaluated by comparing the&#xD;
      difference between baseline and end values of the different treatments using ANCOVA model&#xD;
      with the baseline value of the test as covariate. Adjusted means were calculated and&#xD;
      confidence intervals at 95% (95%) by the ANCOVA model. As the main decision criterion of&#xD;
      efficacy the contrast between the adjusted means at the endpoint of the study between the two&#xD;
      treatment groups will be performed. Additionally and as an exploratory intent, shall be&#xD;
      evaluated the compared effect at the different times of observation. No multiplicity&#xD;
      adjustments will be made due to the exploratory nature of this second analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of relevant deviations in the cases pursuant of the parametric tests, it will be&#xD;
      applied a nonparametric approach using transformations to ranges of the corresponding&#xD;
      variables. The main analysis of the efficacy will be done with the population intended to&#xD;
      treat. However, as evidence of sensitivity and robustness of the results, the analysis under&#xD;
      the protocol approach will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tolerability and acceptability tests All patients who have been randomized and treated will&#xD;
      be included in the safety analysis. The frequency of appearance of adverse events in the two&#xD;
      groups will be compared using the Fisher's exact test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level of significance In all proposed statistical tests the level of significance required&#xD;
      shall be the conventional (p &lt; 0.05 bilateral). No provisions have been made to perform any&#xD;
      multiplicity adjust except in the intermediate analysis.&#xD;
