    <textblock>
      This study will explore ways to improve the effectiveness of patient Self Management at a&#xD;
      time when genetic test results guide new treatments that will dramatically increase the&#xD;
      possibility of cure of the hepatitis C virus.The study will also focus on the interactions&#xD;
      between provider and patients and the ways that technical work, adaptive work and adaptive&#xD;
      leadership foster patient self-management.This proposed 2 year exploratory mixed-methods 12&#xD;
      longitudinal case study will explore patients' and providers' explanations for how and why&#xD;
      they engage in technical work, adaptive work, and adaptive leadership and the ways in which&#xD;
      these strategies promote or pose barriers to patients' self-management of Chronic Hepatitis C&#xD;
      in the context of the new genetic test results and treatments. Specific aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1: Examine how technical work, adaptive work and adaptive leadership influence patients'&#xD;
      perceptions of their likelihood of cure and how this work relates to self-management during&#xD;
      12 to 24 weeks of treatment for Chronic Hepatitis C. Research questions are: 1.1) How do&#xD;
      patients describe their interactions with the providers? 1.2) How do these interactions shape&#xD;
      patients' perceptions of the likelihood of cure? 1.3) How do patients' understanding of their&#xD;
      interactions with the provider promote the use of or pose barriers to self-management during&#xD;
      treatment?&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: Describe providers' use of technical work, and adaptive leadership approaches during&#xD;
      clinical encounters,to include nurse education visits. Research questions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1) What technical work, and adaptive leadership approaches do providers use when sharing&#xD;
      treatment information with patients during the clinical encounters. 2.2) What explanations do&#xD;
      providers give for how and why they use technical work and adaptive leadership approaches?&#xD;
      AIM 3: Describe the trajectories of illness perceptions(Control/Cure sub-scale - Illness&#xD;
      Perception Scale), symptoms (M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory) , viral load, and&#xD;
      self-management (Patient Activation Measure) in relation to patient and provider reports of&#xD;
      technical work, adaptive work, and adaptive leadership from the index clinical encounter to&#xD;
      the follow-up treatment response encounter (ranging from 12 to 24 weeks).&#xD;

    <description>Self Management as measured by the Patient Activation Measure which is an measure of their responses. The study team will plot a trajectory line using the Patient Activation Measure across all time points. The team is interested in knowing if this measure changes based on the patients self-management and his/her interaction with the health care provider.</description>
