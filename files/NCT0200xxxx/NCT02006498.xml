  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised study to examine whether high dose Sillymarin will be able to help&#xD;
      improve fat-induced liver damage in the liver. The study hypothesis is that high dose&#xD;
      Sillymarin will be able to reduce steato-hepatitis (fat-related liver inflammation) better&#xD;
      than placebo.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES OF STUDY Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the safety and adverse event profile of Silymarin compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the efficacy of Silymarin as defined by an improvement in non-alcoholic&#xD;
           steatosis (NAS) activity score by at least 30% from baseline compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare NAS activity before and after Silymarin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To characterize changes in ALT and AST during Silymarin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare insulin resistance measured by HOMAr during Silymarin therapy.&#xD;

    <description>Sillymarin is derived from the milk thistle plant, Silybum marianum, a herbal remedy that has been used for centuries for diseases of the liver. It is a complex mixture of 6 major flavonolignans (silybins A and B, isosilybins A and B, silychristin, and silydianin), as well as other minor polyphenolic compounds.</description>
