    <textblock>
      -  Lung cancer is one of causes of the malignant tumor-associated death on a global scale,&#xD;
           in which the surgery is the only effective approach in patients with non-small cell lung&#xD;
           cancer (NSCLC). As present, the total postoperative 5-year survival rate of NSCLC is&#xD;
           40%, while only 4%～15% patients can benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy[1]. American&#xD;
           National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) manual recommends that adjuvant&#xD;
           chemotherapy can be performed on NSCLC patients in phase Ⅱ～ⅢA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In order to assure the necessity of adjuvant chemotherapy on NSCLC patients in phase ⅠB&#xD;
           or which kind of patients would benefit from it after the establishment of new staging,&#xD;
           a multi-subject group of lung cancer set up a perspective, randomized, open clinical&#xD;
           trial to explore whether adjuvant chemotherapy was effective on NSCLC patients in phase&#xD;
           ⅠB under new staging policy, and to collect the characteristics of patients who could&#xD;
           benefit from the treatment and the better adjuvant drugs after operation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  In postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, navelbine plus platinum (NP), the most commonly&#xD;
           used therapeutic protocol, had more advantages than other 3 generations of new drugs&#xD;
           plus platinum. With the continuous implementation of individual therapies for lung&#xD;
           cancer, some new drugs became selective to pathological patterns and gene types, and it&#xD;
           was unclear whether these drugs would be more effective than conventional drugs in&#xD;
           postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. The first- and second-generation of drugs were not&#xD;
           observed with survival advantages except the third generation, so what conclusion would&#xD;
           be made in selecting individual chemotherapeutic drugs according to pathological&#xD;
           patterns? In this study, Pemetrexed plus Platinum were adopted in postoperative adjuvant&#xD;
           chemotherapy on patients with adeno-carcinoma, while Docetaxel plus Platinum were&#xD;
           performed on those with non-adeno-carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Apart from individual chemotherapy on the basis of different pathological patterns,&#xD;
           anti-angiogenesis therapy has been quickly developed in recent years, becoming the most&#xD;
           effective approach to improve chemotherapeutic efficacy. The main mechanism of&#xD;
           anti-angiogenesis drugs includes inhabiting tumor angiogenesis to postpone or inhabit&#xD;
           the recurrence of residual tumor through reconstructing the balance of anti-angiogenesis&#xD;
           and preventing the growth of micro-metastasis to keep it in resting stage. The effect of&#xD;
           adjuvant chemotherapy can be promoted by increasing the drug sensitivity, and survival&#xD;
           time can be prolonged though further delaying the time and decreasing the rate of&#xD;
           postoperative recurrence and metastasis of tumor by anti-angiogenesis therapy combined&#xD;
           with adjuvant chemotherapy. As more attentions are increasingly given to&#xD;
           anti-angiogenesis drugs in postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy at present, Endostar, an&#xD;
           anti-angiogenesis drug studied independently in China, had favorable effect in treating&#xD;
           advanced lung cancer when combined with chemotherapy. Therefore, this study protocol to&#xD;
           gather the effect of Endostar on improving the survival of early lung cancer patients by&#xD;
           observing its effect on partial NSCLC patients in treatment group when combined with&#xD;
           other therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A total of 392 NSCLC patients in phase ⅠB were selected in this perspective, randomized,&#xD;
           open and control clinical trial, in which 262 and 130 patients served as research and&#xD;
           control groups respectively by 2:1. Patients 4-8 weeks after operation were divided&#xD;
           according to different high risk factors. A total of 4-week different chemotherapies (21&#xD;
           d as a course) were given to patients with different pathological patterns in research&#xD;
           group, in which adeno-carcinoma group and non-adeno-carcinoma group were treated by&#xD;
           Pemetrexed plus Cis-platinum and Docetaxel plus Cis-platinum, respectively. Then, above&#xD;
           two groups were randomly divided into two subgroups respectively by 1:1, with subgroup 1&#xD;
           being treated with original chemotherapies while subgroup 2 being added with&#xD;
           rh-Endostatin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High risk factors included poor differentiation (including neuro-endocrine carcinoma),&#xD;
           blood vessel invasion, wedge incision, tumor diameter &gt;4 cm, visceral pleura&#xD;
           involvement, ambiguous N staging and incisal edge &lt;1 cm.&#xD;
