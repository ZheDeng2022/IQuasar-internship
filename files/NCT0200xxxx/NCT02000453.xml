  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label exploratory study to investigate the safety of 400 milligram (mg )&#xD;
      twice a day (b.i.d.) GSK2586184 in patients with moderate to severe, active ulcerative&#xD;
      colitis (UC). Study medication will be administered orally (as tablets), twice daily, for up&#xD;
      to 8 weeks (56 days). Study medication will be taken with food. Each subject will have 6&#xD;
      out-patient visits: Screening (Day -30 to -1); Baseline and Start of treatment (Day 1); Week&#xD;
      2 (Day 14); Week 4 (Day 28); Week 8 (Day 56); and Follow-up (Week 12; Day 84). Visit windows&#xD;
      for weeks 2, 4 and 8 will be + 2 days. The primary objective of this study is to assess the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of GSK2586184. The primary endpoints to measure safety are laboratory&#xD;
      tests (including haematology, clinical chemistry and serum creatinine), vital signs, 12-lead&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG), physical examination, and adverse event reporting. These are&#xD;
      standard measurements to evaluate safety.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Moderate to severely active UC at least 6 months prior to Screening confirmed by&#xD;
             colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy with video recording, and biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A Mayo score of 6 to 12 points and endoscopy sub score of 2 to 3 at screening, despite&#xD;
             concurrent treatment with at least 1 of the following (oral corticosteroids or any&#xD;
             oral 5-aminosalicylic acid (ASA) or both as defined below): Oral 5-ASA at a stable&#xD;
             dose (&gt;=2.4grams (g)/day) for at least 4 weeks from first dose. Must remain on a&#xD;
             stable dose until end of treatment, Stable oral corticosteroid dose (prednisone of&#xD;
             &lt;=20 mg/day or equivalent) for at least 14 days prior to Baseline (must remain on a&#xD;
             stable dose until end of treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Otherwise healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a&#xD;
             medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests&#xD;
             and cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters&#xD;
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if&#xD;
             the investigator agrees that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk&#xD;
             factors and will not interfere with the study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Non-childbearing potential&#xD;
             defined as: pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy;&#xD;
             or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;

        (&lt;147 picomole [pmol]/liter [L]) is confirmatory). Females on hormone replacement therapy&#xD;
        (HRT) must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status before study&#xD;
        enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2 to 4 weeks should elapse between the&#xD;
        cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of&#xD;
        HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT&#xD;
        during the study without use of a contraceptive method.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Unable to refrain from the use of the prohibited drugs before the stated time before&#xD;
             first dose of study medication until completion of the follow-up visit.&#xD;
