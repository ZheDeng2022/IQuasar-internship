  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is low doses of Optina (formerly known as Danazol)&#xD;
      (DMI-5207) that may be an effective treatment for diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular&#xD;
      edema (DME). Laboratory studies have demonstrated that low doses of this drug may treat&#xD;
      diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema by two important ways, decreasing blood&#xD;
      vessel permeability (related to leaking and edema) and by decreasing the formation of new&#xD;
      leaky blood vessels. Optina is not approved by Health Canada for the treatment of diabetic&#xD;
      macular edema but higher doses of Optina are approved by Health Canada for treatment of&#xD;
      endometriosis (growth of cells similar to those that form inside of the womb that grows&#xD;
      outside of the womb) and fibrocystic breast disease (a condition of the breast tissue).&#xD;
      Higher doses of Optina have also been approved in the United States and many other countries&#xD;
      since the mid-1970s in the treatment of men and women with hereditary angioedema (a disease&#xD;
      which causes swelling in parts of the body) in addition to endometriosis and fibrocystic&#xD;
      breast disease in women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the Optina doses that will be used in the current study are less than half of the&#xD;
      typical starting doses for the approved indications. This can be compared to &quot;high-dose&quot;&#xD;
      aspirin that is used to treat, for example, headache, while low-dose &quot;baby aspirin&quot; is used&#xD;
      to reduce blood clotting. Similarly, Optina has two different effects at high and low dose.&#xD;
      The low doses for this study have been selected based on the laboratory studies mentioned&#xD;
      above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and effectiveness of low doses of&#xD;
      Optina in the treatment of macular edema due to diabetes, and also to test if it helps to&#xD;
      slow the development of macular edema.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. An ocular condition (other than diabetic retinopathy) that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, might affect macular edema or alter visual acuity during the course of&#xD;
             the study, e.g., vein occlusion, uveitis or other ocular inflammatory disease,&#xD;
             Irvine-Gass Syndrome, etc.&#xD;
