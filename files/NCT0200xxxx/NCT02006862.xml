&#xD;
      Treating first episode- Treatment of acute- Maintenance therapy , relapse prevention -&#xD;
      Treatment -resistant schizophrenia Treating first episode&#xD;
&#xD;
      • The oral antipsychotics ( APS ) second generation ( atypical ) considered the treatment of&#xD;
      choice : olanzapine , risperidone , quetiapine , aripiprazole , ziprasidone , amisulpride ,&#xD;
      paliperidone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sertindole used in patients who can not tolerate at least one of the remaining APS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Advantages monotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;

           defined&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The appropriate duration of therapy should be continued for 12-24 months after the&#xD;

&#xD;
      Treatment of acute phase .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  first-line treatment is oral second generation APS . The doses appropriate to move&#xD;
           within the therapeutic range as defined&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For patients who received first-generation APS and had either reduced efficacy or&#xD;
           intolerable side effects, the treatment of choice is to switch to oral second-generation&#xD;
           APS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If patients receiving first-generation APS with good response and no side effects ,&#xD;
           remain in these&#xD;

           ) as the treatment with atypical APS requires close monitoring and control routine&#xD;
           Investigations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the acute phase and high rates of relapse , treatment appropriate to continue for&#xD;
           12-24 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If it is determined appropriate treatment discontinuation should be done gradually and&#xD;
           with close monitoring to identify relapse symptoms&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  If the patient has received at least two APS ( including one informal ) for at least 6-8&#xD;
           weeks each without adequate clinical response , consider the resistant form of the&#xD;
           disease and the possibility of using clozapine . In some cases it is useful to add a&#xD;
           second APS to treatment with clozapine&#xD;
