    <description>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) for the alleviation of chronic neuropathic pain in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). The stimulation will be applied bilaterally or unilaterally in the midbrain periaqueductal/periventricular gray region (PAG/PVG).&#xD;
Extended participation in the study, which will last approximately 2 more years, precisely 104 weeks.The purpose of this extended portion of the study is to obtain long-term follow-up information on safety and efficacy, in subjects that have opted to receive continuing brain stimulation. Investigators label weeks in terms of original enrollment. Thus the surgery occurs in weeks 7 and 8 and the original study finishes in week 52, with the extension lasting from week 53 to week 156.</description>

&#xD;
          1. Age 22-60 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Level of injury at or above T12&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Neuropathic pain at or below the level of injury, as determined based on pain in an&#xD;
             area with neurological deficit and described as burning, shooting, electric, stinging&#xD;
             etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The injury must have occurred at least 1 year prior to entering the study and&#xD;
             participants must have experienced chronic pain for a minimum of six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The injury level must be at or above T12, and the disability must have a grade on the&#xD;
             American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) of ASIA-A, ASIA-B, ASIA-C or&#xD;
             ASIA-D as determined by a qualified examiners.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Autonomic dysreflexia can be present, but is not a requirement. This is defined as a&#xD;
             rise of systolic pressure by more than 30 mmHg during noxious skin stimulation or when&#xD;
             the bladder or bowel is full, or apparently spontaneously over a period of minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Pain (neuropathic) of moderate severity or greater is present, when the patient is&#xD;
             taking medication, with a score of at least 4 on a numerical rating scale (range of 0&#xD;
             to 10).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Treatment with at least two of the following drug classes must have failed to give&#xD;
             satisfactory pain relief within the last two years: anticonvulsants e.g., pregabalin,&#xD;
             gabapentin); antidepressants (e.g., trazodone, amitriptyline); NSAIDS (e.g.,&#xD;
             ibuprofen). In addition, at least one of the following must have proved ineffective:&#xD;
             exercise-based rehabilitation, massage therapy using a variety of methods, acupuncture&#xD;
             using pressure, needles, heat, or electrical stimulation on specific points on the&#xD;
             body and psychological interventions such as cognitive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The subject must be taking pain medication to maintain a stable level of medication&#xD;
             from 4 weeks before surgery to 12 weeks after (the primary endpoint), except on the&#xD;
             day of surgery.&#xD;
