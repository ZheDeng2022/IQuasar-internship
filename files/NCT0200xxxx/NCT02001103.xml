  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this project is to test if memantine add-on therapy will be helpful for&#xD;
      patients with first episode schizophrenia who present with or without cognitive impairments&#xD;
      and negative symptoms, to examine the efficacy and safety of memantine as an adjuvant agent&#xD;
      to their ongoing maintenance therapy with atypical antipsychotics. Our objectives include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Test memantine add-on by 2 different dosages comparing to a placebo-controlled group of&#xD;
           clinically stable first episode schizophrenic patients who are under second-generation&#xD;
           antipsychotic maintenance therapy. The results will give us information regarding&#xD;
           effective dosage and the profile of adverse drug reactions while using on this&#xD;
           population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine whether the effect of memantine add-on will be affected by any significant&#xD;
           baseline clinical variables or predisposed cognitive deficits. That is to say, if&#xD;
           memantine will only demonstrate adjunctive effect on those who are cognitively impaired&#xD;
           or its effect is independent from baseline cognitive functioning or the severity of&#xD;
           baseline psychopathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examine the changes in negative symptoms as the secondary outcomes to see if such a&#xD;
           cognitive enhancing effect to be concurrent with an improvement in negative symptoms or&#xD;
           independent from changes in negative symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Treat the changes in positive symptoms and other clinical outcomes, such as readmission,&#xD;
           being employed/going back to school, and psycho-social functioning scores as the&#xD;
           tertiary outcomes to examine the effectiveness of memantine add-on.&#xD;

      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a 12-week double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial of memantine add-on to&#xD;
      concurrent antipsychotic therapy for clinically stable patients with first episode&#xD;
      schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from the outpatient clinic of the study hospital. We will hold&#xD;
      information campaigns to encourage referrals once the clinical trial procedure is set.&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed for eligibility based on the criteria detailed below. Written&#xD;
      informed consent will be obtained from eligible subjects or the subjects' parents if they are&#xD;
      younger than the age of 18 years. Baseline clinical and neuropsychological assessments will&#xD;
      be done at first. Patients will receive a single dose of memantine 5 mg to test if any&#xD;
      allergic reactions to those who have never used it before. And then they will be randomized&#xD;
      into 3 groups: the first group receives a target dose of memantine 10 mg/day, the second&#xD;
      group receives a target dose of memantine 20 mg/day, and the third is a placebo control&#xD;
      group. Both the participants and the clinicians are blinded to the agents and dosage they are&#xD;
      taking. The dose titrating schedule for medication groups will be 5 mg/day for the first week&#xD;
      with an increment of 5 mg per week to reach their designated targeted dose. So the10 mg&#xD;
      add-on group will reach their target dose by the beginning of the second week and the 20&#xD;
      mg/day add-on group will reach their target dose by the beginning of the fourth week.&#xD;
      Participants will be scheduled to return visit on week 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 for dispense of&#xD;
      medication and clinical assessments. By the end of the 12-week trial, they will receive all&#xD;
      clinical and neuropsychological assessments again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To use the least resources and to make most use of the information, as well as take into&#xD;
      account of attrition, we plan to recruit 40 patients for each group with a total of 120&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
