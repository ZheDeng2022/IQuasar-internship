      Investigators will analyzed systolic and diastolic function during and after ischemia induced&#xD;
      by percutaneous coronary intervention.Also will be analyzed a local work index during acute&#xD;

      PART 1: ANALYSIS OF LAYER SPECIFIC SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC FUNCTION DURING ACUTE ISCHEMIA&#xD;
      INDUCED BY PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION 35 patients with normal systolic left&#xD;
      ventricular function at baseline with indication for elective percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      angioplasty will be included in the study. In these patients acute ischemia will be induced&#xD;
      by elective percutaneous coronary angioplasty with balloon inflation and thus vessel&#xD;
      occlusion for 60 sec. During these 60 seconds ischemia will develop throughout all layers of&#xD;
      the myocardium affecting diastolic systolic and diastolic function. During the subsequent&#xD;
      reperfusion period signs of ischemia with systolic and diastolic dysfunction of all layers&#xD;
      will subside. Echocardiographic imaging at short intervals of 10 sec during ischemia and at&#xD;
      intervals of 20 sec during reperfusion up to 10 min after reopening of the vessel as well as&#xD;
      1 hour and 24 hours later will allow serial comparison of strain curves and thereby allow&#xD;
      definition of the time sequence systolic and diastolic function abnormalities occur in three&#xD;
      myocardial layers as well as the resolution of abnormalities during reperfusion. The analysis&#xD;
      of circumferential as well as radial strain will allow definition of differences between&#xD;
      radial and circumferential strain during ischemia induction and resolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART 2: ANALYSIS OF LOCAL WORK INDEX DURING ACUTE ISCHEMIA INDUCED BY PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY&#xD;
      INTERVENTION.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the same 35 patients as in Clinical step 1 the local work index of the ischemic area as&#xD;
      well as the contralateral non-ischemic areas will be determined in serial studies to&#xD;
      determine the onset of abnormality, the amount of abnormality and the resolution of&#xD;
      abnormality. Changes in local work index in the ischemic area will be related to changes in&#xD;
      peak systolic strain and strain imaging diastolic index.&#xD;

    <description>Percutaneous coronary intervention is performed according to standard practice. Direct stenting is required for the procedure as it is done in most coronary interventions today. After insertion of the non-inflated stent into the coronary lesion there should still be flow to the distal vessel. The stent should be implanted at high-pressure with balloon inflation lasting for 60 seconds to allow adequate expansion of the stent. Post-dilatation should be performed if required. However, this should be done more than 5 minutes after stent implantation.</description>
