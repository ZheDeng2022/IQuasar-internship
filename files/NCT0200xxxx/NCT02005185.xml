  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anesthesia for more than 120 minutes given to children less than 2 years of age without&#xD;
      coexisting diseases of the central nervous system or the heart cause long-term impairment of&#xD;
      recognition memory.&#xD;

      If the subject enrolls in the study, the child will undergo testing for 1) memory, 2) general&#xD;
      brain function (i.e. intelligence testing). The parent will complete 3) a parental assessment&#xD;
      of the subject's behavior through a standardized questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial testing of all case and control participants will include an assessment for&#xD;
      neurologic and psychiatric conditions, including attention deficit or learning disorders. In&#xD;
      addition, each participant will be assessed by the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence&#xD;
      (WASI) and the Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL), which measures children's psychological&#xD;
      well-being, competencies and behavioral/emotional problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After explaining the study to your child, we will show your child 80 items on a computer&#xD;
      screen with a colored border in either in red, green, blue, or yellow. Following a short&#xD;
      break, we will show your child 160 items on the screen. Half of these items were previously&#xD;
      displayed and half of these items are new. We will ask your child two or three questions:&#xD;
      Have we shown you this item before?How sure are you about your response? Your child will be&#xD;
      given the choice of one of three categories: Very sure / halfway sure / not sure. What color&#xD;
      was it? This question will only be asked if the answer to question 1 was yes.This portion of&#xD;
      the test takes about 30 min. Subjects will then participate in a similar test of picture&#xD;
      recognition, but we will ask about the location of the original image instead of the color.&#xD;
      Your child will then be given a standardized intelligence test. This takes roughly 45 min to&#xD;
      an hour to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some test participants will partake in a reading portion where the test administrator will&#xD;
      read a passage to the participant and the child will say whether or not they recognize a&#xD;
      series of phrases. This should take about 20 min to complete. Participants are read a passage&#xD;
      and presented with a series of sentences. After listening to the text, they will be informed&#xD;
      that some of the sentences they will hear are part of the text, whereas other sentences are&#xD;
      new. They will be asked to circle &quot;yes&quot; on their answer sheet when they recognize the&#xD;
      sentence as being taken directly from the text, and &quot;no&quot; when they think the sentence was not&#xD;
      taken from the text and has not been heard before. It will be emphasized that participants&#xD;
      must recognize as old only those sentences that included exactly the same words as the&#xD;
      sentences encountered in the text. Participants will also be told that for every &quot;yes&quot; answer&#xD;
      they would have to select the option &quot;Remember&quot; if they have a clear memory of their&#xD;
      encounter with the sentence in mind, and they can further remember some qualitative and&#xD;
      contextual information related to the memory itself, or select the option &quot;Familiar&quot; if they&#xD;
      have the feeling that the sentence is part of the text story but they cannot recollect any&#xD;
      qualitative detail about the encoding of the sentence.&#xD;
