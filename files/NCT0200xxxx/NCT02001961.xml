  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a cross-sectional, observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no difference in the amount of extracellular volume (ECV or scarring) in the hearts&#xD;
      of patients with heart failure as compared to control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart failure occurs when the heart muscle has become too weak to work properly. It is&#xD;
      associated with an increase in the amount of connective tissue (collagen) which replaces dead&#xD;
      heart muscle cells (scarring). Currently a biopsy of the muscle is the only way to measure&#xD;
      the amount of scarring. This is invasive and rarely done in children. Because of this, it is&#xD;
      difficult to measure the amount of scarring in a particular patient or disease process, which&#xD;
      is important for improving our understanding and treatment of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive imaging tool which is routinely&#xD;
      used to look at areas of local scarring in heart muscle. Because the scarring is so&#xD;
      widespread in paediatric patients, we have not been able to use this method previously. Now&#xD;
      new imaging techniques allow us to look at widespread scarring but these have not yet been&#xD;
      validated in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to use late gadolinium enhancement (T1 mapping) to measure the amount of scarring in&#xD;
      patients with heart failure (we have evidence that their heart biopsies show increased&#xD;
      amounts of scar tissue) and children having MRI scans for other reasons. We will use measures&#xD;
      of function including echocardiography and 6 minute walk test to compare to the amount of&#xD;
      scarring. This will help us to know whether the amount of scarring will be clinically useful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will look at the amount of various proteins in the blood of patients and control subjects&#xD;
      which are related to the scarring and cell death processes. We already use blood tests to&#xD;
      monitor heart failure and these tests may help us to refine our testing and improve timing of&#xD;
      treatment (e.g. transplantation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will help us to design further research in this field.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will be under the care of Great Ormond Street Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be three main patient groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Heart Failure Patients (MRI Clinically indicated)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Heart Failure Patients (Voluntarily recruited from clinic)&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. 8-16 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Non-GA only&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Control subjects (Clinically indicated brain MRI with contrast)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will include Great Ormond Street patients in this trial who are known to the heart failure&#xD;
      team because they have been diagnosed with DCM for at least 3 months. They will have an&#xD;
      established diagnosis of heart failure and will be under regular follow up. Where possible,&#xD;
      we will attempt to align the research study review date with that of the patient's regular&#xD;
      annual review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will include patients who are to have a cardiac MRI scan with contrast for clinical&#xD;
      reasons. These patients will be of any age and will have the scan under GA if appropriate, In&#xD;
      addition, we will recruit patients from heart failure clinic who are not due to have scans&#xD;
      for clinical reasons. These patients will be between 8-16 years to allow cooperation with the&#xD;
      MRI scan protocol without the need for general anaesthetic (GA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age-matched control patients will be those having routine MRI with contrast for non-cardiac&#xD;
      MRI scans. They will also have blood tests for cardiac biomarkers at the time of insertion of&#xD;
      the cannula for contrast injection. These will be patients identified as requiring gadolinium&#xD;
      contrast for neurological imaging. They will include patients who are awake and those sedated&#xD;
      or under GA. These patients will mainly be having routine brain MRI with contrast for&#xD;
      epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will be fully consented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart Failure Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit patients being referred for cardiac MRI scanning for clinical reasons as well&#xD;
      as inviting patients to volunteer for an MRI. Patients who do not require a cardiac MRI for&#xD;
      clinical reasons will be over the age of 8 years to allow for cooperation with the MRI&#xD;
      without general anaesthesia. Patients under follow up by the heart failure team will be&#xD;
      contacted by their primary care consultant in the first instance to introduce the study and&#xD;
      invite the patient to participate. It will be made clear there is no obligation to join the&#xD;
      study and their treatment will be unaffected by their decision. They will be free to withdraw&#xD;
      consent at any time. The patients will be invited to phone the study coordinator (DP) to ask&#xD;
      questions, express willingness to participate or to decline. Non-responders will be sent one&#xD;
      further letter of invitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients being referred to the MRI department at Great Ormond Street Hospital will be&#xD;
      identified once they have been allocated to a neurological MRI protocol with gadolinium&#xD;
      enhancement. The radiologist allocating the patient will contact the patients' primary&#xD;
      consultant to inform them about the study and request permission to contact the family. The&#xD;
      family will be contacted once permission has been given, first by phone and then information&#xD;
      sheets will be provided. The patients will be invited to phone the study coordinator (DP) to&#xD;
      ask questions, express willingness to participate or to decline. Non-responders will be sent&#xD;
      one further letter of invitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Travel costs will be reimbursed where these are incurred specifically for participation in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written, informed consent will be obtained from all participants if they choose to take part&#xD;
      in this study. Information sheets will also be provided to the patients' GP and their&#xD;
      cardiology physician, if they are under separate cardiology follow-up. Patients will be free&#xD;
      to withdraw at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks &amp; Burdens from the study protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main risk arising from our study relates to the insertion of an IV line and&#xD;
      administration of a gadolinium-based contrast agent. Such contrast agents are widely used in&#xD;
      clinical practice and are extremely safe when administered within standard dosage guidelines.&#xD;
      There are, however, potential complications of allergic reaction and development of&#xD;
      Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis (NSF). Such allergic reactions are rare and when they occur,&#xD;
      the majority are mild.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To mitigate this risk we will exclude patients with a previous history of allergic response&#xD;
      to gadolinium-containing agents as well as those with a severe atopic history or history of&#xD;
      renal impairment. There are no known cases of NSF in patients with normal renal function(1).&#xD;
      We will measure renal function in all patients within 1 month of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients being scanned specifically for the study, we will select patients over 8 years&#xD;
      of age, to avoid the need for general anaesthetic. We will attempt to select mainly patients&#xD;
      who require MRI scanning with contrast for clinical indications. The control group will only&#xD;
      consist of those having MRI for clinical indications. In this case, the only burden will be&#xD;
      increased time in the scanner of around 20 minutes to obtain the sequences required. Evidence&#xD;
      from our institution shows that the increased duration of general anaesthetic is not harmful&#xD;
      and does not lead to complications or adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will obtain blood samples for serum bio-marker measurement and haematocrit at the time of&#xD;
      IV line insertion so this does not represent an additional intervention for the patient. We&#xD;
      will use local anaesthetic cream or spray as requested by the patient and will use play and&#xD;
      distraction techniques to minimise distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no potential adverse effects of a properly conducted transthoracic echocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 6 minute walk test will only be employed if the patient is able and willing to&#xD;
      participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no potential adverse effects of a properly conducted MRI scan. The magnetic field&#xD;
      and RF pulses are not known to cause any physical harm in properly selected subjects. Such&#xD;
      selection will involve careful screening of the patients' medical history for any surgery or&#xD;
      accidents that might have introduced metal to their bodies e.g. cerebral artery aneurysm&#xD;
      clips or a metal foreign body in an eye. This will require a review of the patient's notes&#xD;
      once consent has been given and a written checklist at the time of MRI scan. Such patients&#xD;
      are not scanned in standard clinical practice and would also be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, there is no realistic potential for pain, discomfort, distress, inconvenience or&#xD;
      detrimental change to lifestyle anticipated for the participants from the MRI scan itself.&#xD;

      Unexpected clinical findings&#xD;
&#xD;
      If new abnormalities or medical issues come to light as a result of the study investigations,&#xD;
      the patient's GP and hospital consultant will be informed. Medical follow-up of these issues&#xD;
      will be through the patient's usual medical carers.&#xD;
