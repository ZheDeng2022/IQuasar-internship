  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer results when undifferentiated cells grow in an uncontrolled manner, crowding out&#xD;
      normal cells, causing morbidity and ultimately mortality. The cancer stem cell theory&#xD;
      suggests that most tumors undergo a process of differentiation through which a relatively&#xD;
      rare cancer stem or progenitor cell (CSC) gives rise to more differentiated populations of&#xD;
      cells (including transiently amplifying cells) comprising the bulk of the tumor. As a result&#xD;
      of this cellular diversity, one or more cells within the tumor are likely to be resistant to&#xD;
      therapy. Among cells resistant to a given therapy, only CSCs can repopulate the tumor. A key&#xD;
      feature of this resistant subset of CSCs is that they repopulate a tumor resistant to the&#xD;
      original intervention. The cellular programs driving the uncontrolled proliferation of many&#xD;
      solid tumors result from aberrant activity of Wnt, Shh, and/or Notch signaling pathways in&#xD;
      CSC. Thus, therapies that down-regulate the activity of these fundamental pathways in CSCs&#xD;
      will be effective in the treatment of cancer. The investigators' research program focuses on&#xD;
      the elucidation of signaling mechanisms, control of cellular processes and discovery of small&#xD;
      molecules that selectively target Wnt, Shh, and Notch signaling pathways that are fundamental&#xD;
      to CSCs. Our preliminary results identified a novel Notch associated protein NACK that&#xD;
      functions as a transcriptional co-activator of Notch. Moreover, Nack is expressed in human&#xD;
      solid tumors and is required for cell survival and tumor growth in notch -dependent tumor&#xD;
      cells. The investigators' aim is to further interrogate the link between Notch and Nack.&#xD;
