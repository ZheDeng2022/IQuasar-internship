      Lack of physical activity is associated with negative health outcomes, including obesity,&#xD;
      diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. There are calls from NIH and medical organizations to&#xD;
      integrate the use mobile devices, such as smartphones, to provide &quot;e-health&quot; interventions to&#xD;
      patients in their daily life. Referred to as Ecological Momentary Interventions [EMI], these&#xD;
      innovative mobile methods provide an opportunity for researchers and clinicians to offer&#xD;
      tailored intervention material to people at specific times and in specific settings when they&#xD;
      may be most in need of such support. To our knowledge no study has used objective ambulatory&#xD;
      assessment data to deliver EMI. This preliminary work is to demonstrate the feasibility, and&#xD;
      test preliminary efficacy, of using a Bluetooth accelerometer to provide real-time feedback&#xD;
      on a smartphone to increase objectively measured steps (i.e., increase activity). A&#xD;
      within-person design will be used, including assessment, intervention, and follow-up phases.&#xD;
      During the assessment phase objective physical activity (using accelerometers) will be&#xD;
      collected. In the intervention phase participants will also receive real-time feedback&#xD;
      throughout the day regarding their total steps and personalized step goals. Objectively&#xD;
      measured steps and disease status measures will be used to evaluate efficacy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Lack of physical activity is associated with negative health outcomes, including obesity,&#xD;
      diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. A myriad of interventions aimed at increasing daily&#xD;
      physical activity (PA) exist. Increasing PA levels has been shown to improve health among&#xD;
      patients with cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Accelerometers and pedometers can be&#xD;
      useful tools in such interventions, particularly when used to provide participants with&#xD;
      individualized feedback on progress toward PA goals. These programs typically require&#xD;
      participants to set PA goals (e.g., number of steps/day), wear pedometers, and record daily&#xD;
      activity levels from the pedometers. This process relies heavily on accurate self-reported&#xD;
      information and is both time- and effort-intensive for participants, thus limiting&#xD;
      acceptability and longer-term viability of this intervention option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an increasing trend in health behavior research to use mobile devices, such as&#xD;
      smartphones to provide interventions. These methods - known as Ecological Momentary&#xD;
      Interventions [EMI] - are innovative because they allow researchers and clinicians to offered&#xD;
      information to people at specific times and in settings when they may be most in need of such&#xD;
      support. One way EMI can be tailored is by having participants complete repeated self-report&#xD;
      assessments on mobile devices such as smartphones (known as Ecological Momentary Assessment&#xD;
      [EMA]), and then using this material to identify times when people are in need of&#xD;
      intervention. Although some studies (including recent studies conducted by members of our&#xD;
      research team) have developed interventions that use EMA to create real-time interventions&#xD;
      that are delivered in daily life, to our knowledge no study has used objective ambulatory&#xD;
      assessment data to do so. Using objective data is potentially advantageous because it&#xD;
      utilizes passive data collection (requiring little or no input by participants), and thus&#xD;
      reduces participant burden and potential concerns regarding accuracy of self-reported data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first aim of this study is to establish the feasibility and acceptability of integrating&#xD;
      Bluetooth-enabled activity monitor with smartphones to provide real-time feedback regarding&#xD;
      physical activity in everyday life. We will evaluate feasibility and acceptability of this&#xD;
      intervention method by tracking intervention delivery and participant compliance with EMA.&#xD;
      This information will be automatically recorded by smartphone and activity monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second aim of this work is to provide a preliminary evaluation of the efficacy of&#xD;
      delivering real-time feedback based on objectively measured PA. Our primary outcome is number&#xD;
      of objectively measured steps. It is expected that participants will increase from their&#xD;
      baseline number of steps when receiving personalized feedback and reminders on the&#xD;
      smartphones.&#xD;
