  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall prevalence of Ovarian Cancer in the United States according to the US SEER&#xD;
      Registry is 182,710 women. Ovarian cancer also has the highest mortality rate of the&#xD;
      gynecological cancers. The overall five-year survival rate is 45% and for Stages III and IV&#xD;
      it is only 20-25%. The majority of these are aged 50 years or older, but a few girls less&#xD;
      than 10 years of age have been diagnosed with ovarian cancer. This risk increases with age&#xD;
      and decreases with numbers of pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prognosis for many carcinomas is dependent on the extent of surgical resection. At&#xD;
      present, the ability to perform a complete resection with negative margins is limited by the&#xD;
      investigator's ability to palpate and visualize the tumor and its borders. In many cases, a&#xD;
      more radical resection than necessary is performed in order to provide assurance that&#xD;
      negative margins are achieved. This approach may also increase complication rates, as well as&#xD;
      short- and long-term morbidity. It is desirable to improve visualization of primary tumors&#xD;
      and occult metastases in real time, during surgery. The use of fluorescent probes that&#xD;
      recognize cancer-specific antigens, in conjunction with a clinical imaging system, is under&#xD;
      investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ovarian cancer is a prototypic disease for this type of clinical imaging system called&#xD;
      intra-operative imaging. Except in Stage IV, the tumors are confined to the pelvis or abdomen&#xD;
      and typically involve extensions or implants onto pelvic or abdominal organs or membranes.&#xD;
      Tumor debulking surgery is common early in the disease process as many of the tumors can be&#xD;
      identified by appearance or feel in the skilled surgeon's hands. The major problems are that&#xD;
      tumors can be diffuse and numerous, of various sizes, and often not readily visible in the&#xD;
      surgical field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over 90-95% of serous ovarian cancers express folate receptor (FR)-alpha, making this&#xD;
      receptor an ideal target for marking most ovarian cancers. Folate is the prototypic agonist&#xD;
      at the FR-alpha with potential uses for imaging and targeted therapeutic&#xD;
      strategies.Chemotherapy does not affect FR-alpha expression in ovarian cancer specimens&#xD;
      examined by immunohistochemistry, so prior treatment is unlikely to affect utility of&#xD;
      FR-alpha agonists as imaging or therapeutic agents.&#xD;
