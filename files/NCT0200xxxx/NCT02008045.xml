      The purpose of this study is to collect and compare information from cranial ultrasounds,&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging scans, neurological exam and neuropsychological assessments of&#xD;
      children. The investigators hope that the information collected in this study will help with&#xD;
      early screening, diagnosis and treatment of brain injury in newborns as well as identify a&#xD;
      connection between MR imaging (MRI-magnetic resonance imaging, MRS-magnetic resonance&#xD;
      spectroscopy) and neurodevelopmental outcome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the last two decades, major advances have been made in the clinical care of premature and&#xD;
      term infants, including in the management of sepsis and respiratory compromise that can&#xD;
      contribute to neurological disabilities in survivors. The incidence of classic cystic&#xD;
      periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) has declined and a more diffuse and non-cystic pattern of&#xD;
      cerebral white matter injury is more predominant. Although multiple pathologies occur in&#xD;
      premature infants, the principal variety accounting for the predominance of&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental disability is PVL. This disability in very low birth weight infants (VLBW)&#xD;
      (&lt; 1500 grams) includes cognitive/behavioral deficits in 25-50% and cerebral palsy in 5-10%.&#xD;
      Neuroimaging studies of VLBW survivors suggest that the cerebral palsy is related to the&#xD;
      focal necrotic lesions of PVL, whereas the cognitive/behavioral deficits correlate with more&#xD;
      diffuse cerebral white matter injury. PVL is defined as damaged immature cerebral white&#xD;
      matter with periventricular focal necrosis (&quot;focal&quot; component) in association with diffuse&#xD;
      reactive gliosis and microglial activation in the surrounding white matter (&quot;diffuse&quot;&#xD;
      component). Of note, PVL occurs in the late preterm infant and the term infant, particularly&#xD;
      in cases of congenital heart disease. The pathogenesis of perinatal white matter injury is&#xD;
      currently thought to be related to a complex interaction between maternal/fetal infection,&#xD;
      cytokines and hypoxia-ischemia which results in both the generation of reactive oxygen&#xD;
      specific agents (oxidative stress), apoptotic oligodendrocyte cell death, and axonal injury.&#xD;
      In long-term survivors with PVL, neuroimaging studies often demonstrate reduced cerebral&#xD;
      white matter volume, impaired myelination, ventriculomegaly and reduced volume in the&#xD;
      cerebral cortex, thalamus/basal ganglia and cerebellum. In many of these long-term studies,&#xD;
      the preterm children studies had normal cranial ultrasound. Cranial ultrasound, however, is&#xD;
      not adequate for assessing non-cystic focal or diffuse white matter injury. To date, there&#xD;
      are no longitudinal MR studies of preterm or congenital heart disease infants which correlate&#xD;
      advanced neonatal MR imaging techniques with long-term neurodevelopmental outcome or advanced&#xD;
      MR techniques performed in the childhood period.&#xD;
