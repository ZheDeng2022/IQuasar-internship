    <textblock>
      There will be three parts to this phase I study: 1) the Combination Dose Finding cohort; 2)&#xD;
      the Combination Expansion cohort; and 3) the Monotherapy MET Amplified cohort. In the&#xD;
      Combination Dose Finding cohort and the Combination Expansion cohort, we will combine&#xD;
      cabozantinib and panitumumab in patients with KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer&#xD;
      (CRC). In the Monotherapy MET Amplified cohort, we will screen at least 50 patients for MET&#xD;
      gene amplification (&quot;MET amplification&quot;). Patients with MET amplification will receive&#xD;
      cabozantinib only (monotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this open-label phase Ib trial are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended phase II dose for the&#xD;
           combination of cabozantinib and panitumumab in patients with KRAS wild-type metastatic&#xD;
           colorectal cancer and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify the objective response rate (ORR) of cabozantinib monotherapy in patients&#xD;
           with prospectively identified MET amplified metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To describe the non-dose limiting toxicities of cabozantinib and panitumumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To describe the clinical activity (ORR, PFS, OS) of cabozantinib and panitumumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To describe the safety and tolerability of cabozantinib monotherapy in patients with MET&#xD;
           amplified colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To describe the clinical activity (PFS, OS) of cabozantinib monotherapy in patients with&#xD;
           MET amplified colorectal cancer.&#xD;

&#xD;
        v. history of surgery as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. major surgery within 3 months of the first dose of cabozantinib if there were no wound&#xD;
             healing complications or within 6 months of the first dose of cabozantinib if there&#xD;
             were wound complications&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. minor surgery, including dental procedures, within 1 month of the first dose of&#xD;
             cabozantinib if there were no wound healing complications or within 3 months of the&#xD;
             first dose of cabozantinib if there were wound complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition, complete wound healing from prior surgery must be confirmed at least 28 days&#xD;
        before the first dose of cabozantinib irrespective of the time from surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        19. History of interstitial lung disease (e.g., pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis) or&#xD;
        evidence of interstitial lung disease on baseline chest CT scan.&#xD;

&#xD;
        21. Corrected QT interval calculated by the Fridericia formula (QTcF) &gt; 500 ms within 28&#xD;
        days before start of treatment. Note: At baseline (i.e. screening), three ECGs to be&#xD;
        obtained within 30 minutes but approximately 2 minutes apart (i.e. triplicate). If the&#xD;
        average of the three consecutive results for QTcF is ≤ 500 ms, the subject meets&#xD;
        eligibility in this regard.&#xD;
&#xD;
        22. Pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        23. For the Combination Dose Finding and Combination Expansion cohorts only: Previously&#xD;
        identified allergy or hypersensitivity to components of the study treatment formulation or&#xD;
        panitumumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        24. Unable or unwilling to abide by the study protocol or cooperate fully with the&#xD;
        investigator or designee.&#xD;
&#xD;
