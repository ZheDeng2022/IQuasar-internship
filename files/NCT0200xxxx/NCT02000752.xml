      In this study, a single blind randomized trial is carried out in order to compare placental&#xD;
      detachment times when Ren Mai 6 is stimulated and when a different placebo point is used. So,&#xD;
      a lower detachment time is assumed to be related to a higher uterine contraction, and,&#xD;
      therefore, a decrease in the hemorrhage postpartum. We focus on measuring the time it takes&#xD;
      to placental delivery due to the fact that, if this point promotes the uterine contraction,&#xD;
      then the placental delivery will be produced in a short time. Thus, this technique could&#xD;
      decrease the hemorrhage postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal outcome of the study is the placental expulsion time. This time is measured by&#xD;
      the midwife who is responsible of the birth, and it considers the time passed between the&#xD;
      delivery of the newborn and the complete expulsion of the placenta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerning the secondary outcomes, the application of real acupuncture in Ren Mai 6 point,&#xD;
      and sham acupuncture in the placebo point are considered. Their study is derived from the&#xD;
      statistical analysis of the results of the principal outcome. The existence of pain related&#xD;
      to the treatment and the degree of satisfaction of the mother is also a secondary outcome,&#xD;
      analyzed by the survey that the midwife carries out no more than 2 hours after the labor. At&#xD;
      last, it is important to highlight that the degree of satisfaction of the midwife is also&#xD;
      considered as a secondary outcome, since it is registered in the same survey.&#xD;

      This study is designed as a single-blind randomized clinical trial with parallel design, and&#xD;
      third party evaluation at the Hospital Universitario Príncipe de Asturias in Alcalá de&#xD;
      Henares (Madrid, Spain). The study will be carry out with primiparous women who were in&#xD;
      labour at this hospital. Information sheets about the study will be distributed by the&#xD;
      different health care centers coordinated by the hospital. The midwives will give the&#xD;
      information sheets to pregnant women during the pregnancy's attendances. The aim is to let&#xD;
      pregnant women know about the study before their labour date in order to encourage them to&#xD;
      participate in it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women fulfilling all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will&#xD;
      be invited to participate in the experiment. These requirements includes primiparous women&#xD;
      from 20 to 35 years old, with 37 to 42 weeks of gestation, and with a low obstetric risk&#xD;
      labor with epidural analgesia. It is important to highlight that the midwife responsible for&#xD;
      the labor is different from the acupuncturist responsible for the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An envelope with 120 leaflets will be enabled, 60 with control group name and 60 with&#xD;
      intervention group name. After the approval of the pregnant woman, the acupuncturist will ask&#xD;
      a partner midwife, a doctor or a nursing assistant to randomly pick up one of the leaflets&#xD;
      from the aforementioned envelope, so pregnant woman will be assigned to a group. It is&#xD;
      important to highlight that both the midwife and the pregnant woman must not know about the&#xD;
      assigned group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the labor ward, after the childbirth, the baby is placed on the abdomen of the puerperal&#xD;
      mother to facilitate maternal link. Then, the umbilical cord is clamped by the midwife. After&#xD;
      all this process, that takes around a minute, the needle will be placed by the acupuncturist&#xD;
      in the position corresponding to the randomly assigned group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the intervention group with real acupuncture, after the umbilical cord is clamped, the&#xD;
      acupuncturist disinfects the abdominal area with antiseptic and pricks the needle in the&#xD;
      point Ren Mai 6. This point is located on the anterior midline, between the umbilicus and the&#xD;
      upper part of the pubic symphysis, at a distance of 0.3d from the umbilicus, being d the&#xD;
      distance from the umbilicus to the upper part of the pubic symphysis. A sterilized steel&#xD;
      needle of 0.25x40 mm will be inserted in this point at 15-30 mm, depending on the adipose&#xD;
      tissue of the woman.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding to the control group with sham acupuncture, after the umbilical cord is clamped,&#xD;
      the acupuncturist disinfects the abdominal area with antiseptic and pricks the needle in the&#xD;
      placebo point with a sterilized 0.25x40 mm steel needle. The control point is located at the&#xD;
      same horizontal level than the Ren Mai 6 point, but at 0.6d to the left of the anterior&#xD;
      midline of the mother. In this case, the sterilized steel needle of 0.25x25 mm will be&#xD;
      inserted 15 mm into the tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the needle is punctured by the acupuncturist, the midwife waits for the placental&#xD;
      expulsion, and pays attention on the time passed from the childbirth to the placental&#xD;
      expulsion. After that, the time is registered into the partogram by the midwife. The needle&#xD;
      will be then removed and the abdominal area completely sterilized by the acupuncturist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A survey will be fulfilled by the midwife no more than 2 hours after the intervention. In&#xD;
      this survey, the midwife takes notes on the comfort with which the technique was performed&#xD;
      with four possible answers (high, moderate, medium and low comfort level). Furthermore, the&#xD;
      acupuncturist will ask to the puerperal woman about the pain felt with the technique with&#xD;
      four possible answers (painless, mild pain, moderate pain and high pain). The acupuncturist&#xD;
      will also ask to the puerperal woman if she would recommend this technique to any of her&#xD;
      friends with two possibles answers (yes or not).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed-up during the hospital stay, an expected average of 3 days. The&#xD;
      expulsion placental time will be measured in the first thirty minutes after the childbirth is&#xD;
      occurred. The satisfaction of professionals and participants, and the existence of pain&#xD;
      during the technique will be registered into the 2 hours after the childbirth and before the&#xD;
      puerperal woman is moved to the obstetrics plant which is out of the labor room. At last, the&#xD;
      physician will annotate the existence of puerperal complications during the hospital stay in&#xD;
      a specific sheet attached in the medical record of the woman. It will be done just before the&#xD;
      woman discharges from the hospital, approximately three days after the labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the medical record, an incidence form will be attached to be fulfilled in case of adverse&#xD;
      events. So, the physician in charge of evaluating the welfare of the puerperal woman will&#xD;
      register any kind of complication if it would have appeared. In other case, the physician&#xD;
      will note the lack of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerning the procedure and data collection, the acupuncturist will request permission to&#xD;
      midwife responsible of the mother for their collaboration in the study in the pre-labor room.&#xD;
      The acupuncturist will explain the study to the mother and her partner and will apply for her&#xD;
      voluntary participation being the informed consent offered then. All information will be&#xD;
      given when the pregnant woman is without pain of labor, preferably when the woman is under&#xD;
      the epidural analgesia effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the study will be performed in conditions of respect for individual rights and ethical&#xD;
      principles affecting biomedical research involving human. Written informed consent will be&#xD;
      fulfilled by all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, the physical and mental integrity of women will be safeguarded, as well as&#xD;
      privacy and data protection in accordance to the spanish Organic Law 15/1999, of December 13,&#xD;
      Protection of Personal Data. All the participants will give their informed consent in&#xD;
      accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (25) assuring confidentiality and freedom to&#xD;
      withdraw from the study at any time.&#xD;
