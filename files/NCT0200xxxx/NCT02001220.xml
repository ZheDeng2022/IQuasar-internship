  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During weaning the work of breathing is transferred from the ventilator back to the patient.&#xD;
      Approximately 40% of the time on ventilators is spent weaning. Studies support the use of&#xD;
      screening protocols and tests of patient's ability to breathe spontaneously (SBTs) to&#xD;
      identify weaning candidates. Once daily screening is the current standard of care. With&#xD;
      respiratory therapists (RTs) in Canadian intensive care units (ICUs), a significant&#xD;
      opportunity exists to screen patients more frequently, conduct more SBTs, and reduce the time&#xD;
      spent on ventilators and in the ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is seeking to identify the optimal screening frequency to minimize patients'&#xD;
      exposure to invasive ventilation. The RELEASE Trial will evaluate a simple a simple&#xD;
      construct: more frequent screening will result In earlier identification of weaning&#xD;
      candidates, more frequent SBT's, and less time spent on ventilators and in the ICU. More&#xD;
      frequent screening is an appealing intervention because it is sensible, low risk, and&#xD;
      represents a cost effective use of current resources. This simple intervention holds promise&#xD;
      as a strategy that could change clinical practice, enhance the care delivered to critically&#xD;
      ill adults, and improve clinically important outcomes.&#xD;

      Eligible patients (&lt; 65 years of age) will be randomly assigned 1:1 to either 'once daily' or&#xD;
      'at least twice daily' screening for weaning readiness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization, RTs in participating ICUs will be informed of the allocated study arm&#xD;
      and bedside nurses will complete a checklist that documents practices related to sedation,&#xD;
      analgesia, delirium, and mobilization before each screening period in both study arms. RTs&#xD;
      will conduct weaning readiness assessments either 'once daily' or 'at least twice daily' as&#xD;
      per group assignment. The checklists, completed by bedside nurses, will merely record current&#xD;
      practices in sedation, analgesia and delirium management, and whether patients are being&#xD;
      passively or actively mobilized before SBTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the 'once daily screening arm', RTs will screen invasively ventilated patients between&#xD;
      approximately 06:00 - 08:00 hours daily. If not yet completed, RTs will prompt RNs to&#xD;
      complete the 'practices checklist'. In the 'at least twice daily' screening arm patients will&#xD;
      be screened at a minimum between approximately 06:00 - 08:00 hours and 13:00 - 15:00 hours&#xD;
      daily. If a screening period is missed inadvertently or due to an investigation or&#xD;
      intervention (operation/procedure) necessitating absence from the ICU, it may be conducted&#xD;
      later on the same day and ideally within 6 hours of the scheduled screening period.&#xD;
      Additional screening trials in the 'at least twice daily' screening arm will be permitted at&#xD;
      the discretion of the clinical team (RTs and physicians). Regardless of group assignment, if&#xD;
      the SBT screening assessment is passed, an SBT will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event of study inclusion before 10:00 am, both study arms will be initiated on the day&#xD;
      of randomization. For patients randomized after 10:00 am, only one assessment will be&#xD;
      required in both study arms on day one. Similarly, if patients can breathe spontaneously on&#xD;
      PS or trigger spontaneous breaths on volume or pressure AC, volume or pressure SIMV ± PS,&#xD;
      PRVC, PAV, VS, or APRV before 10:00 am, then the allocated screening protocol can resume.&#xD;
      However if, patients can not be returned to a mode that permits spontaneous breaths (PS) or&#xD;
      supports triggered breaths (volume or pressure AC, volume or pressure SIMV ± PS, PRVC, PAV,&#xD;
      VS, or APRV) until after 10:00 am, screening will be conducted only once daily in both&#xD;
      treatment arms on the day of the return and will resume as per treatment allocation&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To pass the 'readiness to wean screen' and undergo an SBT, all of the following criteria must&#xD;
      be met:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The patient must be capable of initiating spontaneous breaths on Pressure Support (PS)&#xD;
           or triggering breaths on volume or pressure Assist Control (AC), volume or pressure&#xD;
           Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (SIMV) ± PS, Pressure Regulated Volume&#xD;
           Control (PRVC) or Airway Pressure Release Ventilation (APRV),&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fractional concentration of&#xD;
           inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) greater than or equal to 200 mm Hg,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Respiratory rate (RR) less than or equal to 35 breaths/min,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) less than or equal to 10 cm H2O,&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Heart rate (HR) less than or equal to 140 beats/min,&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The ratio of respiratory frequency to tidal volume (f/VT) &lt; 105 breaths/min/L during a 2&#xD;
           minute assessment.&#xD;

The initial SBT will be 30-120 minutes in duration and may be conducted with any one of the following techniques: T-piece, CPAP &lt; to 5 cm H2 O or PS &lt; 8 cm H2 O with PEEP &lt; 5 - 10 cm H2O. Higher levels of PEEP (8-10 cm H2O) will be permitted (and recorded) to allow for clinician discretion in conducting SBTs in specific patients (e.g., obese, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and use of different humidification strategies.
