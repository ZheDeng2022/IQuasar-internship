    <textblock>
      Second-line chemotherapy represents an option in gastric cancer, especially for patients with&#xD;
      adequate performance status. Two randomized phase III trials comparing 2nd-line docetaxel&#xD;
      with best-supportive care have reported a benefit in favor of chemotherapy. Capecitabine is a&#xD;
      fluoropyrimidine carbamate, which has a broader spectrum of antitumor activity than other&#xD;
      fluoropyrimidines. In gastric cancer xenografts. metronomic capecitabine inhibited&#xD;
      angiogenesis, growth of gastric cancer and improved survival with less toxicity. Given its&#xD;
      potential low toxicity, the combination of docetaxel and metronomic capecitabine needs to be&#xD;
      evaluated to assess efficacy and tolerability in patients with advanced gastric cancer&#xD;
      previously treated with a fluoropyrimidine-based and platinum-based chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite a declining incidence in many developed countries, gastric cancer remains the second&#xD;
      most common cause of cancer deaths, and it is responsible for about 12% of all cancer-related&#xD;
      deaths worldwide. More than two-thirds of patients diagnosed with gastric cancer will have&#xD;
      unresectable disease and despite the fact that surgical pathological resection can be&#xD;
      curative for many patients, most of them develop recurrent disease. Evidence supports the use&#xD;
      of palliative chemotherapy with the aims of improving symptoms, quality of life, and possibly&#xD;
      prolonging survival. Combination chemotherapy regimens have been developed in the hopes of&#xD;
      improving response rate and overall survival (OS). Unfortunately, the benefits of combination&#xD;
      chemotherapy have been modest. In general, regimens containing fluoropyrimidine and platinum&#xD;
      agents are widely accepted as potential standard therapies. Although a large proportion of&#xD;
      patients with metastatic or recurrent gastric cancer may initially respond to chemotherapy,&#xD;
      they ultimately progress. In addition, many patients have primary refractory disease. The&#xD;
      median survival at progression after first-line chemotherapy for metastatic gastric cancer is&#xD;
      about 2.5 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Docetaxel is one of the most active single agents in the treatment of gastric cancer. In the&#xD;
      first line setting, at a dose of 60-100 mg/m2 repeated every 3 weeks, response rates ranged&#xD;
      from 17% to 20%. Docetaxel is the only taxane that has been evaluated in the context of a&#xD;
      phase III study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low-dose metronomic chemotherapy represents a new strategy to treat solid tumors by&#xD;
      exhibiting stronger anti-angiogenic activity and less side effects, especially in combination&#xD;
      with other anti-angiogenic agents. Capecitabine is a fluoropyrimidine carbamate, which has a&#xD;
      broader spectrum of antitumor activity than other fluoropyrimidines. In gastric cancer&#xD;
      xenografts. metronomic capecitabine inhibited angiogenesis, growth of gastric cancer and&#xD;
      improved survival with less toxicity. In combination with other drugs, the treatment with&#xD;
      metronomic capecitabine has proven its efficacy with minimal toxicity in breast cancer, in&#xD;
      metastatic renal-cell carcinoma, in advanced adrenocortical carcinoma, in hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma, in prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;metronomic&quot; strategy was also considered in pretreated elderly patients with advanced&#xD;
      gastric cancer. Eligible patients with advanced gastric cancer were treated with capecitabine&#xD;
      until disease progression or significant toxicity. Metronomic chemotherapy achieved a disease&#xD;
      control rate at 8 weeks of 51.1% , and the objective response rate was 20.9% . The median&#xD;
      time-to-progression and median overall survival were 3.6 months and 7.6 months, respectively.&#xD;
      Grade II neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were observed in 13.3 and 2.2% of patients,&#xD;
      respectively. Grade II/III nonhematological toxicities included diarrhea (4.4%), stomatitis&#xD;
      (13.4%), and hand-foot syndrome (15.5%). No grade 4 toxicity, neutropenic fever or&#xD;
      treatment-related deaths occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these premises and to the fact that the role of metronomic chemotherapy remains&#xD;
      controversial, its optimal therapeutic use has not yet been defined, we designed this phase&#xD;
      II study with tha aim to assess efficacy and tolerability of metronomic capecitabine in&#xD;
      combination with the conventional use of docetaxel in patients with advanced gastric cancer&#xD;
      previously treated with a fluoropyrimidine-based and platinum-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
