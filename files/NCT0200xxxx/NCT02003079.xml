  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) have a defective protein, which is known as the&#xD;
      cystic-fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR). The CFTR transports salt and hydrates mucous.&#xD;
      CFTR defects may result in the accumulation of thick mucous in the sinus cavities. As a&#xD;
      result, the tiny hair-like structures that sweep mucous out of the sinuses cannot function&#xD;
      properly, which can lead to recurrent infection and swelling of the sinus walls. When&#xD;
      symptoms are persistent for more than 12 weeks, this is known as chronic rhinosinusitis&#xD;
      (CRS). The symptoms that are associated with CRS are nasal discharge, congestion, facial pain&#xD;
      or pressure and reduced sense of smell. CRS in non-CF patients affects a large number of&#xD;
      individuals in Canada and has been found to be associated with poor quality of life. In the&#xD;
      CF population the life expectancy is increasing but chronic disease like CRS is becoming&#xD;
      increasingly prevalent. Investigators currently do not know the impact that CRS has on the&#xD;
      health-related quality of life in adults with CF and how many suffer from symptoms. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to determine the impact of CRS among adults with CF, in order to gain a&#xD;
      better understanding of chronic disease among these individuals. The investigators strongly&#xD;
      feel this research will improve the referral processes between Respirologists and&#xD;
      Otolaryngologists, thereby improving treatment and quality of life for patients.&#xD;
