  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess changes from baseline in insulin sensitivity, hepatic&#xD;
      fat content and beta cell function after approximately 24-25 weeks of treatment with&#xD;
      canagliflozin compared to placebo in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with&#xD;
      inadequate glycemic (blood sugar) control on metformin monotherapy or on combination therapy&#xD;
      with metformin and a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind (neither physician nor participants knows the treatment that the&#xD;
      participant receives), randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance),&#xD;
      placebo-controlled (an inactive substance is compared with a medication to test whether the&#xD;
      medication has a real effect in a clinical study), parallel-groups study which will be&#xD;
      conducted at 2 clinical research centers (CRC) in the US. Approximately 56 participants, ages&#xD;
      25-70 years, with T2DM inadequately controlled on either metformin monotherapy or combination&#xD;
      therapy with metformin and a DPP-4 inhibitor, will be enrolled. The study has 3 phases:&#xD;
      pre-treatment, double-blind treatment, and post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Treatment Phase will consist of a screening visit (Week -5), 14 days Single- Blind&#xD;
      Placebo Run-in period, followed by 14 days of Single-Blind Placebo Baseline Period, during&#xD;
      which participants will be randomized (1:1) to one of 2 treatment groups, either&#xD;
      canagliflozin or placebo. Double-Blind Treatment Phase begins on Day 1, and ends at&#xD;
      approximately Week 25, during which participants will be assessed at least biweekly at&#xD;
      outpatient visits or by telephone contact. Canagliflozin treatment will be initiated at 100&#xD;
      mg/day, with up-titration to 300 mg/day, consistent with the approved INVOKANA® US&#xD;
      Prescribing Information 2013. During post-treatment phase, a follow-up visit will occur&#xD;
      within approximately 28 days after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline and after 24 weeks of treatment with canagliflozin, hepatic and peripheral&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity will be assessed using tracer labeled euglycemic clamp technique; hepatic&#xD;
      fat content will be determined using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS); beta&#xD;
      cell function (insulin secretion rate and beta cell glucose sensitivity) will be assessed&#xD;
      during mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT); substrate oxidation and energy production rates will&#xD;
      be measured using indirect calorimetry during euglycemic clamp and MMTT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, participants will remain on their stable dose regimens of metformin or&#xD;
      combination metformin DPP-4 inhibitor therapy, unless the investigator considers dose&#xD;
      modification to be medically necessary. The total study duration for each participant&#xD;
      participating in this study will be up to approximately 34 weeks.&#xD;
