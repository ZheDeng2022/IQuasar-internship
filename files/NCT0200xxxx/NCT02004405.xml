      Abstract Objective: Autonomic dysfunction is an important mechanism that could explain many&#xD;
      symptoms observed in fibromyalgia (FM). Exercise is an effective treatment, with benefits&#xD;
      potentially mediated through changes in autonomic modulation. Strengthening is one of the&#xD;
      less studied exercises in FM, and the acute and chronic effects of strengthening on the&#xD;
      autonomic system remain unknown. The objective of this study is to assess the effects of&#xD;
      strengthening exercises (STRE) on autonomic modulation, pain perception and the quality of&#xD;
      life (QOL) of FM patients. Methods: Sedentary women with FM (ACR 1990) will be randomly&#xD;
      selected to STRE or flexibility (FLEX) exercises in a blind controlled trial. The intensity&#xD;
      of STRE will be set at 45% of the estimated load of 1 Repetition Maximum (RM) in 12 different&#xD;
      exercises. The primary outcomes will be pain measured using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and&#xD;
      the Heart Rate Variability (HRV) analysis. Other outcomes will be assess: fitness measured by&#xD;
      treadmill test, the sit and reach test (Wells and Dillon's Bench), handgrip dynamometry; and&#xD;
      quality of life by the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), the Beck and Idate&#xD;
      Trait-State Inventory (IDATE), a short-form health survey (SF-36). Statistical analyses and&#xD;
      ethical procedures: The visual analog scale (VAS) for pain will be the primary measure used&#xD;
      to determine sample size. Statistical significance will be set at 5% and power of 80%. These&#xD;
      led to at least 58 participants to be randomized. The main hypothesis is that strengthening&#xD;
      exercise is a better treatment than flexibility exercise to improve pain, HRV and quality of&#xD;
      life. In all measures tested we will consider the null hypothesis (H0) as being the point of&#xD;
      equality between groups tested and H1 the point of difference. Bilateral tests were carried&#xD;
      out adopting a 5% level of significance. The normality of the results will be tested using&#xD;
      the Shapiro-Wilk test. Student's &quot;t&quot;-test for paired samples will be used to perform&#xD;
      intra-group comparisons at different times, when the data were normally distributed, and the&#xD;
      nonparametric equivalent of Student's t-test (Wilcoxon test) will be used when the data show&#xD;
      an asymmetrical distribution. To compare the data between the STRE and FLEX groups, ANOVA for&#xD;
      repeated measures will be used, followed by post-hoc Bonferroni's test.&#xD;

      STUDY PROTOCOL: The experimental group (STRE) will receive strengthening training in &quot;Station&#xD;
      for lifting weight exercises&quot; (Flex Mega 8, Flex Fitness Equipment Brand) using the&#xD;
      recommendations of the American College of Sports Medicine (ACMS, 2010), twice a week, during&#xD;
      45 minutes for 16 weeks. The control group (FLEX) will receive stretching and flexibility&#xD;
      exercise training according to the protocol of prescription and previously tested and&#xD;
      described in appendix F (Valim et al., 2003), twice a week, during 45 minutes for 16 weeks.&#xD;
      The minimum number of patients per group will be 30. The randomization will be by arriving&#xD;
      order of the patients at the Clinic, having 2 groups with a distribution at random one by&#xD;
      one. There will be an examiner for the selection and unblinded randomization and another for&#xD;
      the application of tools that will be blind. Patients will undergo clinical and cardiological&#xD;
      evaluation with an exercise stress test (Ergometric test) request in all of them according to&#xD;
      ACMS as one more method of evaluation for inclusion and exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation will be performed by a blind examiner, an expert physiotherapist in&#xD;
      rheumatology and trained for the application of the tools at the beginning, after 30, 60, 90,&#xD;
      120 days from the treatment onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measure for prescription and muscle strength gain will be by the method of maximal&#xD;
      repetitions (Lindh et al., 1994; Tritschler, 2003; Brosseau et al., 2008; ACSM, 2010). The&#xD;
      evaluations will take place at the beginning, 30, 60, 90, 120 days (final evaluation).&#xD;
      Evaluations will be performed by the same blind examiner for the examined group. The training&#xD;
      team will be formed by a physiotherapist, physical educator, and experienced doctors at&#xD;
      strengthening training and flexibility and stretching exercises and they must follow the&#xD;
      following protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROTOCOL OF EXERCISES The strength training will be performed according to American College&#xD;
      of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and will have a mild to moderate intensity representing 45% of the&#xD;
      estimated 1RM obtained from the maximal repetition method. Eight major muscle groups will be&#xD;
      trained (quadriceps femoris, hamstrings, biceps brachii, triceps brachii, pectoral, calf,&#xD;
      deltoid, and latissimus dorsi) in 12 different exercises, with 3 sets of 12 repetitions (leg&#xD;
      Press, leg extension, hip flexion, pectoral fly, triceps extension, shoulder flexion, leg&#xD;
      curl, calf, pulldown, shoulder abduction, biceps flexion and shoulder extension). Theses 12&#xD;
      different exercises will be distributed in a composed circuit system of 2 sets of exercises:&#xD;
      Set A ((leg Press, leg extension, hip flexion, pectoral fly, triceps extension, shoulder&#xD;
      flexion) and set B (leg curl, calf, pulldown, shoulder abduction, biceps flexion and shoulder&#xD;
      extension). Each set will be applied once a week alternatively. The exercises will be&#xD;
      performed twice a week during 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the training process a load increase will be performed in order to seek progressive&#xD;
      muscle strengthening improvement in a controlled way and according to patients' clinical&#xD;
      evolution. Blood pressure and heart rate will be monitored as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strength and strengthening training will be performed at the Evaluation, Physical&#xD;
      Conditioning and Rehabilitation Laboratory (LACORE) at the University Hospital in in Federal&#xD;
      University of Espirito Santo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have chosen the frequency of twice a week because it is a frequency (for this kind of&#xD;
      study) validated in the literature (Figueroa et al., 2008, Kingsley et al., 2009; 2010).&#xD;
