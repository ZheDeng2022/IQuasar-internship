  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to systematically evaluate the results of medical investigations&#xD;
      to identify symptom and biological patterns and common etiologies of neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although neurodevelopmental disorders are very prevalent (for example Autism affects 1 out of&#xD;
      every 88 children and dyslexia affects up to 15% of the population), the etiology of such&#xD;
      disorders is not known. The purpose of this investigation is to identify common etiologies of&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental disorders (i.e., speech delay, global developmental delay, autism) and&#xD;
      determine if it is possible to find early indicators of the diagnosis and foster the&#xD;
      potential for a better prognosis of these disorders. At this time the investigators examine&#xD;
      patients with neurodevelopment disorders with various medical investigations, but the results&#xD;
      of these investigations are not systematically evaluated. One of the goals of this research&#xD;
      is to systematically examine this information in order to identify patterns of test&#xD;
      abnormalities that have not been previously described. Another goal of this research is to&#xD;
      identify the common etiologies typically identified by the medical evaluation, so we can&#xD;
      further refine our approach. In addition, the investigators now have the ability to evaluate&#xD;
      biological samples for biomarkers that have potential to be diagnostically useful.&#xD;
