  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient reported outcomes (PROs) instruments are often used to measure meaningful treatment&#xD;
      benefit or risk in clinical trials. PROs allow patients voices to be heard in ways that&#xD;
      assist healthcare clinicians to address treatment effects and individual patient preferences.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, infants and young children, especially those with a debilitating disease, such&#xD;
      as neuromuscular disorders (NMD), may be less able to provide clear and concise information&#xD;
      about treatment effects. In this case, we often defer to parents and guardians (to be&#xD;
      referred to collectively as parents throughout protocol) to provide their perception of their&#xD;
      child s overall health and wellbeing. Including parents in the assessment process recognizes&#xD;
      the unique knowledge parents have of their child s development, reinforces their central role&#xD;
      in implementing interventions, and aids in their ability to make better-informed healthcare&#xD;
      decisions [1]. Yet, most parent-reports for young children are confined to overall quality of&#xD;
      life (QoL). While QoL is an important area of assessment, its meaning varies among different&#xD;
      ages and populations, and its results are often not precise enough to reveal small&#xD;
      differences within samples [2]. A more specific area of concern in children with NMD is&#xD;
      early-onset muscle weakness leading to difficulties in motor function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current lack of patient-centered, sensitive measures (based on motor function and item&#xD;
      difficulty hierarchy) that are suited for repeated assessments in infants and young children&#xD;
      with NMD represents a major obstacle to the rapid translation of promising therapeutic&#xD;
      interventions from preclinical models to clinical research studies. Multiple clinical outcome&#xD;
      measures used at a single time-point for capturing a child s functional status are&#xD;
      burdensome, difficult to interpret and do not provide us with comprehensive, meaningful&#xD;
      information to detect changes following an intervention [3]. Psychometric measures that can&#xD;
      be completed by parents make it possible to collect a considerable amount of data over many&#xD;
      time-points rather than being limited to a single clinical observation. Moreover, a&#xD;
      parent-observational measure that focuses on their child s functional performance in their&#xD;
      real-life will maximize the ecological validity of measures of motor development used for&#xD;
      clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To develop a parent reported observational measure of motor development in infants&#xD;
      and young children, which will serve as a complimentary tool to clinical observation by&#xD;
      reporting motor function as observed in the home setting and which will be used in clinical&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Parents of children aged 0-5 with neuromuscular disease and neuromuscular&#xD;
      experts in pediatrics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Qualitative (parent interviews, focus groups) and quantitative study (analysis of&#xD;
      newly developed questionnaire)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: parental responses to phone interviews, neuromuscular expert responses to&#xD;
      focus groups, parental responses to cognitive interviews, validity and reliability of newly&#xD;
      developed questionnaire&#xD;
