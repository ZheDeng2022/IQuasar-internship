    <textblock>
      The MET oncogene encodes the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) for hepatocyte growth factor&#xD;
      (HGF) and controls genetic programs leading to cell growth, invasion and protecÂ¬tion from&#xD;
      apoptosis. Although the definitive role of MET oncogene is yet to be determined in&#xD;
      carcinogenesis of gastric cancer, overexpression and amplification of c-Met has been&#xD;
      demonstrated in gastric cancer cell lines. In addition, approximately 10-20% of gastric&#xD;
      cancer tissues and up to 40% of the scirrhous histological subtype were shown to harbor&#xD;
      increased MET gene copy numbers. Importantly, PHA-665,752, a selective c-Met kinase inhibitor&#xD;
      showed significant reduction of established tumor mass in mouse xenografts with GTL16, a&#xD;
      gastric cancer cell line with &gt;10-fold MET amplification. Another pivotal study showed that&#xD;
      gastric cancer cells with MET amplification were extremely sensitive to PHA-665,752 and&#xD;
      implicated a potential role of c-Met protein in developing theranostics in gastric cancer.&#xD;
      More and more data indicated that c-Met was an important prognostic factor in gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastric cancer is a heterogeneous disease. Does the expression and amplification of c-Met in&#xD;
      the primary lesion differ from the metastatic disease? Does the expression and amplification&#xD;
      of c-Met in the early disease differ from advanced disease? Till now there is no related&#xD;
      report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purposes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the expression and amplification of c-Met between primary lesion and metastatic&#xD;
           lesion together with clinical characteristic, to explore the relationship of c-Met&#xD;
           expression and metastatic pattern&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the expression and amplification of c-Met between early stage and metastatic&#xD;
           stage, and to explore the role of c-MET in the development of carcinoma&#xD;

      We retrospectively collect the metastatic gastric cancer patients who received a surgical&#xD;
      resection of both primary diseases and metastatic lesions during January 2006 and December&#xD;
      2012. Patients are collected based on the following criteria: (1) pathology proven advanced&#xD;
      gastric adenocarcinoma; (2) the paraffin-embedded tissues of the primary and metastatic&#xD;
      lesions were available (3) full information of follow-up. There are 100 patients suitable for&#xD;
      the analysis. c-MET protein expression and amplification are assessed in paraffin-embedded&#xD;
      tissues of the primary and metastatic diseases obtained from 100 patients by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The clinical&#xD;
      pathologic data of the patients are also collected for analysis, including: gender, age,&#xD;
      Karnofsky performance score (KPS), chemotherapy regimens, tumor locations, Lauren&#xD;
      classification, histology subtypes, metastatic sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order compare c-Met expression and amplification between early and advanced stage, we will&#xD;
      match 100 early stage (stage I and stage II) patients based on the following criteria (1)&#xD;
      pathology proven gastric adenocarcinoma with radical resection; (2) the paraffin-embedded&#xD;
      tissues of the primary lesions is available (3) full information of follow-up MET IHC will&#xD;
      employ the Dako MET IHC assay and supplied assay protocol and pathology scoring guideline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MET FISH will also employ the Dako MET FISH assay supplied assay protocol and pathology&#xD;
      scoring guideline.&#xD;

        of the primary and metastatic diseases obtained from 100 patients by immunohistochemistry&#xD;
        (IHC) and Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In order to compare c-Met expression&#xD;
