  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is the most frequent genetic lipoprotein disorder&#xD;
      associated with premature CAD. In Canada, the burden of disease is estimated to be&#xD;
      approximately 83,500 patients. The goal of this initiative is to create a registry of&#xD;
      subjects with FH across Canada. Rare diseases of lipoprotein metabolism are also included.&#xD;
      Using a &quot;hub and spoke&quot; model, the registry extends in various communities to link primary&#xD;
      care physicians with provincial academic centers. The registry includes clinical, biochemical&#xD;
      and demographic information. Specimens (plasma/serum and DNA) are collected for biobanking.&#xD;
      The &quot;local&quot; portion of the registry is available for clinicians to manage patient care, and&#xD;
      identify relatives for screening and treatment (cascade screening). The Canada-wide registry,&#xD;
      which is completely anonymized, will be made available to provide advice to general&#xD;
      practitioners and to support collaborative studies in biomedical, clinical, health outcomes&#xD;
      and health economics research. The data extracted for the provincial portion of the database&#xD;
      will allow administrative database research that will provide important information to key&#xD;
      stakeholders and permit allocation of resources. It will also allow a sound and uniform&#xD;
      rationale for the use of novel therapeutic agents and provide expert advice to regulatory&#xD;
      agencies. At the Canadian level, the database will allow clinicians and researchers to&#xD;
      determine the burden of disease and the long-term effects of treatment. Through the creation&#xD;
      of a Canada-wide network of academic clinics, integrating lipid specialists, endocrinologists&#xD;
      and cardiologists, the Canadian FH registry will lead to significant benefits for FH&#xD;
      patients, clinicians and researchers, biopharmaceutical industry and government.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic lipoprotein disorder characterized by&#xD;
      elevations in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) &gt;95th percentile for age and&#xD;
      gender. Affected individuals may show clinical manifestations (xanthomas, xanthelasmas and&#xD;
      premature arcus corneus) although these manifestations are seen less frequently with early&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment. Untreated, FH will lead to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      (CVD), primarily coronary artery disease (CAD). There are at least three accepted definitions&#xD;
      for FH, based on absolute LDL-C levels (MedPed criteria), the Simon-Broome criteria include a&#xD;
      fixed cut-point for LDL-C, the presence of DNA mutations and xanthomas and the FH Dutch&#xD;
      Criteria (the Netherlands).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are well-developed FH Registries in the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Spain, France, and&#xD;
      the US, through the newly established US FH Foundation. In the United Kingdom, a report on&#xD;
      the economic advantages of treating FH revealed that lipid-lowering statin therapy would lead&#xD;
      to 101 fewer cardiovascular deaths/1000 patients with FH given treatment. The cost saving&#xD;
      from cardiovascular events is estimated at over $CAN 592 million in the UK if all relatives&#xD;
      of index cases were identified and treated, compared with no treatment given. This cascade&#xD;
      testing strategy has been successfully applied in the Netherlands in families of FH probands&#xD;
      with a detected mutation, thus allowing statin treatment of family members at risk of early&#xD;
      coronary heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Canada, the burden of disease is estimated to be approximately 120,000 patients, based on&#xD;
      an allele frequency of LDL-R mutations of 1/311. In the province of Quebec, the allele&#xD;
      frequency is approximately 1/270 and the number of affected subjects is approximately 29,000.&#xD;
      Left untreated, FH men develop cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the third decade of life and&#xD;
      women, in the fourth decade. When identified and treated early, life expectancy is normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this initiative is to create a registry of subjects with FH across Canada&#xD;
      designed to identify subjects with FH and to improve health and healthcare delivery. Rare&#xD;
      diseases of lipoprotein metabolism (orphan diseases) are also included (SMASH registry;&#xD;
      Systems and Molecular Approach of Severe Hyperlipidemia). This registry includes clinical,&#xD;
      biochemical and demographic information. Specimens (plasma/serum and DNA) are collected for&#xD;
      biobanking. The &quot;local&quot; portion of the registry is available for clinicians to manage patient&#xD;
      care, and identify relatives for screening and treatment (cascade screening). The Canada-wide&#xD;
      registry, which is completely anonymized, will be made available to provide advice to general&#xD;
      practitioners and to support collaborative studies in biomedical, clinical, health outcomes&#xD;
      and health economics research. Access to anonymized data from the registry will be given to&#xD;
      researchers, clinicians, biopharmaceutical industry and government by peer-reviewed process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Mission of the Canadian FH Registry is to bring together a multi-disciplinary group of&#xD;
      physicians, basic and clinical researchers to improve the delivery of care to patients with&#xD;
      severe lipoprotein disorders, especially FH, and to foster collaborative research. Our Vision&#xD;
      is to create a Canada-wide network of academic clinics, integrating lipid specialists,&#xD;
      endocrinologists and cardiologists to treat patients with the highest standard of care and to&#xD;
      create a collaborative research environment. Using a &quot;hub and spoke&quot; model, the registry&#xD;
      extends in various communities to link primary care physicians with provincial academic&#xD;
      centers. The Goals are to improve care to patients with FH and to reduce cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease in this population at high risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the wide geographic distribution of patients with FH, we provide a &quot;hub and spoke&quot;&#xD;
      model specialized care. The hubs are based in each province in centers recognized at the&#xD;
      national level for their expertise in lipoprotein disorders and with advanced laboratory&#xD;
      facilities (medical biochemistry, specialized assays, ultracentrifugation, genetic testing).&#xD;
      Radiating from these centers are clinics that treat patients with FH. We propose a three-tier&#xD;
      registry (local, provincial and Canada-wide). The local database is nominative, used solely&#xD;
      by the clinic or center and contain the information obtained by the local investigators and&#xD;
      used for clinical purposes. The provincial database is de-identified and will be used to&#xD;
      generate province-specific health outcomes, resource utilization, health economics and&#xD;
      comparative epidemiological/genetic/clinical features across provinces. The Canadian database&#xD;
      is also anonymous and will serve to generate country-wide statistics, public awareness and&#xD;
      research collaborations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures related to the FH registry are standardized. The various steps associated with&#xD;
      the inclusion of patients within the FH Registry are the following: subject with high LDL-C,&#xD;
      secondary causes ruled out, FH Criteria satisfied, consent form signed, clinical evaluation,&#xD;
      baseline lipid profile, demographic info, family history, longitudinal follow-up (annual data&#xD;
      capture). If a patient has a family history of FH, then we start cascade screening. If the FH&#xD;
      criteria are not satisfied at the beginning of the study then the patient is being asked to&#xD;
      enter in the SMASH registry for other severe disorders of the lipid metabolism. DNA isolation&#xD;
      and banking is being performed at individual sites (locally) only. Central biobanking is not&#xD;
      possible for now. The question form mainly includes data on the familial history of elevated&#xD;
      cholesterol levels and CVD, the patient's medical and surgical history, the physical signs of&#xD;
      FH, and the patient's medication profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The James Hogg Research Centre at St-Paul's Hospital, UBC, Vancouver is providing the&#xD;
      iCAPTURE platform to be used to capture the data from the FH Canada Registry. This center&#xD;
      maintains multi-level security for all database and computer systems. The security measures&#xD;
      include physical entry to the compute facility and access to the systems within the facility.&#xD;
      The server facility is a single entry electronically card accessible room that is equipped&#xD;
      with video surveillance. Entry is accessible to the authorized personnel only. All hard drive&#xD;
      storage is maintained on a SAN which has data encryption. The database utilizes an Oracle&#xD;
      backend and is firewalled and maintained in a separate non public network, and it is FDA (US&#xD;
      Food and Drug administration), Health Canada, PHIA (Personal Health Information Act) and&#xD;
      PIPEDA (Canada Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act) compliant. All&#xD;
      data is de-identified based on role based access and redacted automatically within the&#xD;
      database. All user access is logged. A unique identifier is assigned to each patient entered&#xD;
      in the database, and parents, siblings and all first-degree relatives of each subject is&#xD;
      entered with a distinct identifier. Completely anonymous data, without any identifier -such&#xD;
      as hospital ID number, date of birth, family relationships will be made available to&#xD;
      researchers, policy makers, governments and industry on a per need basis after a submission&#xD;
      of a written request and approval by the Scientific Board in consultation with the Advisory&#xD;
      Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential benefits Patients. Patients will have access to expert care in the field of&#xD;
      lipoprotein disorders and CVD prevention. In many cases, optimal treatment of severe&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia may be best provided by experts in the field. They will have access to&#xD;
      on-going clinical trials and to novel therapies. Furthermore, individual patients will be&#xD;
      offered family screening to identify affected members who would benefit from early diagnosis&#xD;
      and treatment. The identification of new FH cases by cascade screening proves to be both&#xD;
      cost-effective and aligns with the aim of providing personalized medicine for patients with&#xD;
      severe lipoprotein disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinicians. The registry will provide the local (i.e. clinic or hospital) framework to&#xD;
      diagnose patients according to accepted international criteria for FH, to follow the subjects&#xD;
      in time and to perform cascade screening (first, second and third-degree relatives), a&#xD;
      cost-effective strategy to screen potentially affected subjects. The registry will also link&#xD;
      clinicians into a network of specialized clinics that favor collaborative&#xD;
      investigator-initiated research and participation in multi-center studies. The availability&#xD;
      of biobanking will allow the storage of plasma/serum and DNA for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomedical researchers. The identification of novel genes for FH and other rare lipoprotein&#xD;
      disorders has led to a better understanding of metabolic pathways and eventually the&#xD;
      potential for novel therapeutic targets. In addition, gene-gene and gene-environment&#xD;
      interactions research may shed light on mechanisms of disease. clinical-scientists will have&#xD;
      the opportunity to develop investigator-initiated research, using the pan-Canadian registry&#xD;
      and biobanking resources as a platform. Researchers in health outcomes and health economics,&#xD;
      social, gender and ethnic research will have access to the database in collaboration with&#xD;
      provincial administrative databases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopharmaceutical Industry. The biopharmaceutical industry will have access to a group of&#xD;
      lipid experts across Canada, with links internationally, a harmonized database for subjects&#xD;
      with FH and rare lipoprotein disorders. They will have access to a network of established&#xD;
      clinics with a unified database. Access to the registry database will be provided after&#xD;
      review of the intended research. This data will be important in determining health economics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Government. This initiative will allow the development of clinical practice guidelines, to&#xD;
      determine resource allocation according to need, the identification of rare (orphan disease)&#xD;
      lipoprotein disorders requiring specific techniques, such as extracorporeal LDL filtration&#xD;
      for homozygous FH. The initiative will allow the framework to set-up collaborative research&#xD;
      under the peer-review system (HSFC, CIHR). Health outcomes and health economic studies will&#xD;
      allow resource allocation and quality control. Finally centralized genetic testing would&#xD;
      provide molecular diagnostics in a cost-effective manner, when required. This initiative will&#xD;
      dovetail with the CIHR C-CHANGE initiative concerning the harmonization of cardiovascular&#xD;
      preventive guidelines in Canada. To data, we are the only country with harmonized CVD&#xD;
      prevention guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge translation and training. Individual academic institutions with a strong biomedical&#xD;
      research commitment will offer undergraduate and graduate-level training in the field of&#xD;
      lipid and lipoproteins within a country-wide collaborative research environment. Several&#xD;
      centers will offer post-doctoral fellowships for clinicians and PhDs in lipoprotein&#xD;
      metabolism, health outcomes and health economics research. This training of highly qualified&#xD;
      personnel is expected to contribute to the academic and economic engine of the country. A&#xD;
      formal training course, aligned with the National Lipid Association, will provide&#xD;
      certification on the treatment of lipoprotein disorders. The establishment of clinical&#xD;
      practice guidelines for adult and pediatric patients will enable clinicians to hone their&#xD;
      clinical practice to the highest standard. By using well established conferences across&#xD;
      Canada, the aim will be to integrate novel knowledge into the yearly conference programs&#xD;
      across Canada and to disseminate this information to practicing physicians and health care&#xD;
      professionals.&#xD;
