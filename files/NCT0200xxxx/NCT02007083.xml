  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar Spinal Stenosis (LSS) is a clinical entity were narrowing of the spinal canal gives a&#xD;
      compression of the the neural and vascular structures in the spinal canal. This often gives&#xD;
      neurogenic claudication and sometimes severe Low Back Pain (LBP). Surgery for LSS is today&#xD;
      the most often performed procedure in the adult lumbar spine. Beneficial effect of surgical&#xD;
      treatment is well documented by several clinical trials, and a Cochrane review article from&#xD;
      2005 concludes that surgical treatment is superior to non-surgical treatment. The surgical&#xD;
      solution is to decompress the stenotic part of the lumbar spine. There is no consensus in the&#xD;
      literature of which surgical method that gives best long term clinical results. The&#xD;
      investigators are therefore planning a Randomized Controlled Trial, where they will compare&#xD;
      clinical and radiological results of three different surgical methods for LSS. The main&#xD;
      outcome of this study is to answer which surgical method that gives the best long term&#xD;
      clinical results. And, secondary outcome is to find out how much increase of the Dural Sac&#xD;
      Cross Sectional Area is needed to give a long time relief of the patients' symptoms.&#xD;

    <time_frame>2, 5 and 10 years after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will monitor the ODI-index before and after surgery, and calculate the change of ODI after surgery compared to baseline.&#xD;
The primary outcome is a measurement of the change of ODI (version 2.0) from baseline in the three different surgical groups. This will be done by calculating the mean ODI improvement in each group. The investigators will also compare the proportion of &quot;success patients&quot; between the SPO group, the BL group and the UL group, 24 months after the operation. The investigators will dichotomize the patients, in a &quot;succesful outcome group&quot; and in a &quot;non- succesful outcome group&quot;. The threshold value for being categorized as a &quot;succesful outcome&quot; will be computed in a planned study based on data from The Norwegian Registry for Spine Surgery (NORSpine).&#xD;
The investigators also plan to asses short time results after 2 years, intermediate results after 5 years, and long time results after 10 years.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Zurich claudification Scale, Numeric Rating Scale for leg pain, Numeric Rating Scale for back pain, EQ-5D, and self evaluated effect of surgery.</measure>
    <time_frame>2, 5 and 10 years after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>All of the above mentioned questionaires are validated and reliable questionaires to asses the effect of surgical treatment. The effect of the surgical treatment is calculated by the improvement of the different scores, and thereby is an objective way to asses the effect of the surgical treatment.&#xD;
The investigators plan to asses short time results after 2 years, intermediate results after 5 years, and long time results after 10 years.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Dural Sac Cross sectional Area (DSCSA)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators are planning to investigate the DSCSA before and after surgery. Thereby we can monitor which surgical procedure that increases the DSCSA the most. The investigators will also investigate wether a large increase of the DSCSA is needed to maintain good long-time clinical results.</description>

    <description>The multifidus muscles is detached from the spinous process bilaterally.The decompression of the spinal canal is performed by first doing a flavectomy. Thereby performing a laminotomy (about 1/3) of the the lower part of the superior lamina, and a laminotomy of the upper part (about 1/4) of the inferior lamina. This is performed bilaterally.</description>

    <description>The multifidus muscles is detached from the spinous process unilaterally. The laminotomy is first performed ipsilaterally. The decompression of the spinal canal is performed by first doing a flavectomy. Then, performing a laminotomy (about 1/3) of the the lower part of the superior lamina, and a laminotomy of the upper part (about 1/4) of the inferior lamina. Dura is then retracted, and the decompression is performed contralaterally.</description>

    <description>The multifidus muscles is detached from the spinous process unilaterally. An osteotomy of the superior spinous process is performed at the basis, in the actual level. The spinous process with intact interspinal and supraspinal ligaments is then retracted to the contralateral side. The decompression is first performed in the midline. Then one goes laterally on both sides too perform the decompression. About 1/3 of the lower part of the superior lamina is removed, and about 1/4 of the upper part of the inferior lamina is removed.</description>
