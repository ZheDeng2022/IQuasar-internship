  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anecdotal evidence suggests that patients' skin quality may improve as a result of&#xD;
      poly-L-lactic acid injection. While this is not the primary goal of such treatments it is&#xD;
      often seen and described as so called &quot;Sculptra glow&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of repeated subcutaneous injections of&#xD;
      poly-L-lactic acid (Sculptra Aesthetic) on skin quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating subjects will be part of the study for about 15 months. There will be an&#xD;
      initial treatment period of up to 12 weeks, followed by a 12-month follow-up period. There&#xD;
      will be a total of 7 scheduled visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a double-blind, randomized study. &quot;Double-blind&quot; means that neither the&#xD;
      subjects nor the study doctor will know who is receiving Sculptra Aesthetic or placebo.&#xD;
      &quot;Randomized&quot; means that the group subjects will be placed in is decided by chance, similar to&#xD;
      drawing numbers out of a hat or flipping a coin. Subjects will have a 1 out of 2 chance of&#xD;
      receiving the active study drug. After the completion of the study, if subjects are assigned&#xD;
      to the control (placebo) group they will receive free injections with Sculptra Aesthetic same&#xD;
      as the treatment group.&#xD;
