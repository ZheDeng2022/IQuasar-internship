  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SIESTA Home Sleep Study is a pragmatic, multi-centre randomized single-blinded two arm&#xD;
      trial, assisted by a Decision Analytic Model, primarily designed to assess the accuracy,&#xD;
      effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of diagnosing OSA assisted by ApneaDx™ as compared to&#xD;
      PSG as a reference standard.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Ontario, approximately 130,000 sleep studies were conducted in 2008, which is twice the&#xD;
      number of sleep studies reported in 1999. In 2008, Ontario spent approximately $40 million on&#xD;
      polysomnography (PSG) testing alone, despite the fact that access to PSG remained limited,&#xD;
      with an average waiting time of approximately 3.5 months for an in-laboratory sleep study and&#xD;
      approximately 12 months from referral to appropriate treatment. Portable monitors (PM) have&#xD;
      been developed in an effort to substitute for the more costly and labor intensive&#xD;
      clinic-based PSG. As of 2011, there are over 40 PM commercially available in the United&#xD;
      States with different configurations for cardiorespiratory and neurophysiologic signals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the request of the Ontario Health Technology Advisory Committee (OHTAC), a panel that&#xD;
      makes recommendations to the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care about the uptake&#xD;
      and diffusion of health technologies, the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute convened an expert&#xD;
      panel in 2007 to explore alternative approaches to the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea&#xD;
      (OSA). Members of the expert panel suggested that despite the availability of a large number&#xD;
      of PMs, home assessments are problematic as technicians are required to ensure continuous&#xD;
      placement of electrodes for reliable testing. They also suggested that a good screening tool&#xD;
      was not available at that time. The Toronto Rehabilitation Institute therefore undertook a&#xD;
      research study that eventually led to the development of the ApneaDx™ PM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ApneaDx™ is a new PM that uses a microphone to record breath sounds and an acoustical&#xD;
      analysis algorithm of breath sounds to determine the (Apnea Hypopnea Index) AHI. Results from&#xD;
      preliminary studies suggest that the AHI derived from ApneaDx™ approximates that from PSG. In&#xD;
      preliminary studies, it appears that for the diagnosis of sleep apnea, home sleep study with&#xD;
      ApneaDx™ is simple and reliable even when conducted by untrained users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study evaluates the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of OSA diagnosed assisted by a&#xD;
      home sleep study with ApneaDx™. This study will be conducted by the Toronto Health Economics&#xD;
      and Technology Assessment (THETA) Collaborative. Data from this study will be used to support&#xD;
      practice recommendations regarding the use of a home sleep study with ApneaDx™ as input for&#xD;
      diagnosis of OSA by the OHTAC and reimbursement considerations by the Ontario Ministry of&#xD;
      Health and Long-Term Care.&#xD;
