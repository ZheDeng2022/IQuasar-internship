    <textblock>
      Obese patients, who underwent bariatric surgery, are at risk to develop protein malnutrition.&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of postoperative protein supplementation&#xD;
      on weight reduction, body composition and protein status.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bariatric surgery has become a major treatment option for severe obesity in adults. It has&#xD;
      proven its efficiency regarding weight loss and its benefits concerning the improvement or&#xD;
      even remission of obesity related comorbidities. Additionally, bariatric surgery procedures&#xD;
      can be performed laparoscopically, which decreases the complication rate and reduces&#xD;
      postoperative pains. Despite the advantages of bariatric surgery, attention needs to be paid&#xD;
      to the possible risks following the surgical treatment. Postoperative risks often concern the&#xD;
      nutritional status. It has been shown that, beside different micronutrient deficiencies,&#xD;
      bariatric surgery also leads to an increased risk of developing protein malnutrition.&#xD;
      Discussed reasons for this are the malabsorption of nutrients and the restricted food intake&#xD;
      after surgery, which may lead to reduced protein consumption. Postoperative occurrence of&#xD;
      vomiting or different food intolerances may support this effect. Accordingly, if an&#xD;
      inadequate supply persists, a protein deficit will occur and this, in turn, may lead to an&#xD;
      undesirable reduction in muscle mass and plasma protein levels. Based on this background,&#xD;
      numerous studies indicate an increased incidence of protein malnutrition after bariatric&#xD;
      surgery by detecting a decrease in levels of albumin and prealbumin, a significant reduction&#xD;
      in lean body mass, as well as an inadequate protein intake after surgical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary proteins have shown to play an important role in body weight regulation. There is&#xD;
      evidence that a protein-rich diet is supposed to facilitate weight loss, to support&#xD;
      successful weight maintenance, to attain satiety and to preserve lean body mass. Therefore,&#xD;
      the use of protein supplements after bariatric surgery may minimize the risk for developing&#xD;
      protein malnutrition and hence optimize the postoperative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind pilot study was to&#xD;
      evaluate the influence of postoperative protein supplementation on body weight reduction,&#xD;
      body composition and protein status.&#xD;
