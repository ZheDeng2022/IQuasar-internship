  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infants born preterm and of low birth weight are known to be at increased risk for early&#xD;
      onset of cardiovascular and renal disease in adult life. This has been related to low nephron&#xD;
      mass due to inadequate or early termination of glomerulogenesis in utero and during the&#xD;
      perinatal period. Risks for subsequent development of hypertension and kidney disease include&#xD;
      proteinuria, excessive weight gain during early life with insulin resistance and supplemental&#xD;
      high calorie feedings. The long-term goal is for early diagnosis of those infants who are at&#xD;
      risk for future development of hypertension and kidney disease so that the investigators&#xD;
      might intervene to potentially avert progression to adult disease. The objective of this&#xD;
      clinical trial is to acquire data on the natural history of neonatal kidney function and size&#xD;
      in infants born preterm during the first 2 years of life. This will be done through the use&#xD;
      of standard serum and urine markers as well as non-invasive ultrasound technology. The&#xD;
      central hypothesis of this clinical trial is that a subgroup of patients born preterm and of&#xD;
      low birth weight will demonstrate early markers of kidney injury including elevated serum&#xD;
      cystatin C, proteinuria and low kidney size. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis&#xD;
      of preliminary data from our group studying this question retrospectively in older children&#xD;
      born prematurely who have developed overt kidney disease. The rationale for the proposed&#xD;
      research is to develop early serum and demographic markers of pre-clinical kidney disease so&#xD;
      that early intervention can occur. The proposed clinical trial is innovative because it will&#xD;
      investigate the risk factors for kidney dysfunction at a pre-clinical stage with the idea of&#xD;
      gaining more knowledge regarding therapeutic interventions. In addition, the study will&#xD;
      assess serum cystatin C as a surrogate test for glomerular filtration rate which could&#xD;
      indicate worsening kidney function at an earlier stage than serum creatinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research is significant because it is expected to identify at-risk patients for&#xD;
      future renal impairment and to prospectively monitor the persistence of proteinuria and its&#xD;
      effect on kidney function in the short term.&#xD;

      Objectives and Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants born preterm and of low birth weight are known to be at increased risk for early&#xD;
      onset of cardiovascular and renal disease in later life. This has been related to low nephron&#xD;
      mass due to inadequate or early termination of glomerulogenesis in utero and during the&#xD;
      perinatal period. Risks for subsequent development of hypertension and kidney disease include&#xD;
      excessive weight gain during early life with insulin resistance and supplemental high calorie&#xD;
      feedings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims The long-term goal is for early diagnosis of those infants who are at risk for&#xD;
      future development of hypertension and kidney disease so that investigators might intervene&#xD;
      to potentially avert progression to adult disease. The objective of this clinical trial is to&#xD;
      acquire data on the natural history of neonatal kidney function and size in infants born&#xD;
      preterm during the first year of life. This will be done through the use of standard serum&#xD;
      and urine markers as well as non-invasive ultrasound technology. The central hypothesis of&#xD;
      this clinical trial is that a subgroup of patients born preterm will demonstrate early&#xD;
      markers of kidney injury including elevated serum cystatin C, proteinuria and hypertension.&#xD;
      This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of preliminary data from the group studying&#xD;
      this question retrospectively in older children born prematurely who have developed overt&#xD;
      kidney disease. The rationale for the proposed research is to develop early serum and&#xD;
      demographic markers of pre-clinical kidney disease so that early intervention may occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design. This is a single-center case-controlled prospective observational study with&#xD;
      the rationale of evaluating parameters of renal function including proteinuria,&#xD;
      microalbuminuria and cystatin C in preterm infants and associating this with kidney size and&#xD;
      blood pressure during the first 10 years of life. Demographics including race, gender and&#xD;
      growth will provide important perspectives relative to formula and/or breast feeding&#xD;
      with/without high calorie supplements during the first year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I of the Trial is enrollment from birth with collection of blood, urine and umbilical&#xD;
      cords for histomorphometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II will be the &quot;call-back&quot; at 6 to 10 years of age for follow-up assessment of&#xD;
      anthropometric and kidney growth, blood pressure and kidney function.&#xD;
