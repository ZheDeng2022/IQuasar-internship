  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pneumoperitoneum could be due to life threatening conditions and its quickly diagnosis is&#xD;
      important in the emergency department (ED). Signs and symptoms are non-specific and&#xD;
      radiography has low accuracy in the acute setting. Computed tomography (CT) is considered the&#xD;
      gold standard, however it is not a cost-effective option in the vast population of patients&#xD;
      with abdominal pain. Ultrasonography is able to detect as little as 2 ml of free air, however&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonography remains unclear. This study evaluates the accuracy of&#xD;
      ultrasonography for the diagnosis of pneumoperitoneum, the most accurate abdominal scan and&#xD;
      the most accurate echographic sign for the detection of free air.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Consecutive patients presenting to ED for acute abdominal pain and with a diagnosis&#xD;
      of pneumoperitoneum at CT or at surgery (study group) and a similar number of patients&#xD;
      without a diagnosis of pneumoperitoneum (control group) undergo abdominal ultrasonography in&#xD;
      a standardized protocol that include 10 scans for each patient registered on a video of 5&#xD;
      seconds. The videos are randomly reviewed by 4 sonographers and by 2 physicians with no&#xD;
      experience in ultrasonography blind to final diagnosis and to all clinical data with the aim&#xD;
      of detecting for each scan pneumoperitoneum. Accuracy of ultrasonography for the diagnosis of&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum will be calculated considering CT or surgery as gold standard. Furthermore&#xD;
      intra and interobserver agreement and the accuracy of each ultrasonographic sign and scan&#xD;
      will be calculated.&#xD;
