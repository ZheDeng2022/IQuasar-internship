      The purpose of this single-center, prospective, randomized study is to determine the fusion&#xD;
      rates along with the clinical outcomes of commercially available bone graft substitutes&#xD;
      Actifuse mixed with bone marrow aspirate (BMA) versus autograft mixed with demineralized bone&#xD;
      matrix (DBM), in subjects who require anterior cervical corpectomy (ACC) spinal fusion in&#xD;
      patients experiencing cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM).&#xD;

      Background Fusion of the spine was introduced in 1911 for the management of deformity and is&#xD;
      currently used to relieve pain and restore function in patients diagnosed with degenerative&#xD;
      disc disease. Degenerative conditions of the spine resulting in functionally limiting back&#xD;
      pain or neck, and arm pain with or without extremity pain and dysfunction are a major problem&#xD;
      in today's world. Recommended treatment for these conditions can vary initially from bed&#xD;
      rest, exercise, traction, manipulation and drug therapy to eventual surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most common neck conditions that occurs among people older than 50 years is&#xD;
      cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). This may produce symptoms of cervical radiculopathy,&#xD;
      myelopathy, or both. Over time, the normal wear-and-tear effects of aging can lead to a&#xD;
      narrowing of the spinal canal. This compresses or squeezes the spinal cord. CSM can cause a&#xD;
      variety of symptoms, including pain, numbness, and weakness. When patients with degenerative&#xD;
      cervical disease require surgery, an anterior decompression of the neural elements and&#xD;
      reconstruction of the anterior column with allograft, bone graft substitutes or autograft is&#xD;
      common. These types of reconstruction surgery can be referred to as Spinal fusion. The&#xD;
      objective of spinal fusion is to eliminate motion of the vertebral body and thereby relieve&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An anterior cervical corpectomy, fusion and instrumentation, is usually performed for&#xD;
      patients who have pressure on their nerves or spinal cord in their neck. This pressure can&#xD;
      lead to pain, weakness or numbness in the arms and occasionally in the legs as well. If&#xD;
      non-operative treatment such as medications and therapy are ineffective, patients may require&#xD;
      surgery in order to relieve the pressure off their spinal cord and nerves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anterior cervical corpectomy (ACC) and fusion is performed for patients with symptomatic,&#xD;
      progressive cervical spinal stenosis and myelopathy. It is performed to remove the large,&#xD;
      arthritic osteophytes (bone spurs) that are compressing the spinal cord and spinal nerves.&#xD;
      However, in order to do so generally involves removing nearly the entire vertebral body and&#xD;
      disc, which must be replaced with a piece of bone graft or bone graft substitute and mended&#xD;
      (fused) together to maintain stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurosurgeons and orthopedic surgeons are performing bone grafting procedures more&#xD;
      frequently. Surgical applications include treating bone defects, fracture fixation, spinal&#xD;
      fusion and in the revision of failed total joint arthroplasties. According to data collected&#xD;
      by the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, more than 500,000 bone graft procedures are&#xD;
      performed annually in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common source of bone graft used to be autograft, the transfer of a small piece of&#xD;
      the patient's own bone from one site, usually the iliac crest, to another. However, the&#xD;
      amount that can be harvested safely is limited; it increases surgery time and may be&#xD;
      complicated by donor site morbidity. The use of allograft, supplying bone graft from other&#xD;
      patients via bone banks, overcomes these difficulties. However, the demand for allograft now&#xD;
      exceeds the supply, there is a small but finite risk of disease transmission, and it is&#xD;
      highly variable in strength. These factors have led to increasing interest in the use of&#xD;
      synthetic bone graft substitutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the fusion rates along with the clinical outcomes for the use of&#xD;
      Actifuse Synthetic Bone Graft substitutes mixed with bone marrow aspirate and autograft mixed&#xD;
      with demineralized bone matrix in cervical spine fusion. Actifuse is a synthetic, porous,&#xD;
      silicate-substituted hydroxyapatite and has shown that this maximizes a favorable bony&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This randomized study will be conducted prospectively. The clinical and&#xD;
      radiological outcomes of subjects undergoing anterior cervical corpectomy will be documented.&#xD;
      There will be a total of 40 subjects enrolled, 20 in each arm - Actifuse with BMA versus&#xD;
      autograft with DBM. It is anticipated that the study length will be 42 months this is based&#xD;
      on a recruitment period of 18 months followed by a 24 month post-operative follow-up period&#xD;
      for each patient included in the study. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 per arm.&#xD;
      Randomization will be established at the study site by sealed envelopes accessed at the time&#xD;
      of surgery. The sample size of 40 patients will allow statistical comparison between the 2&#xD;
      arms based on a postulated fusion rate of 85 %. Given that this is a single center study with&#xD;
      recruitment over 18 months, the total of 40 subjects is a reasonable goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Population Subjects enrolled in this study will be identified from the surgeon's&#xD;
      medical practice and will include subjects who have failed conservative treatment and have&#xD;
      been identified by their own physician as requiring anterior cervical corpectomy, fusion and&#xD;
      instrumentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be suffering from symptoms with the primary diagnosis of cervical spondylotic&#xD;
      myelopathy or cervical spinal stenosis in one to four contiguous levels between C3 and T1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection The clinical site's research coordinator or nurse will complete case report&#xD;
      forms. Data will be collected prospectively, after the patient has agreed to participate in&#xD;
      the study by signing the consent form. Data will be collected from the patient's medical&#xD;
      records, departmental based electronic records and radiographic reports to verify&#xD;
      eligibility. Once the patient is verified eligible for the study, data will be collected from&#xD;
      the same sources above. Information will be captured on case report forms. The patient will&#xD;
      also complete questionnaire forms. The information collected will be used for study analysis&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parameters To Be Assessed Demographics, medical history, X-ray results, quality of life&#xD;
      (SF-36), CT Scan results, Concomitant medications, adverse events, pregnancy test, Body Mass&#xD;
