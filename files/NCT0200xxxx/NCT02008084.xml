  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to learn what study factors are important in designing a&#xD;
      large, full-scale study of the effects of TRIA-662 on serum triglycerides (TG) and&#xD;
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. In this study, patients will first enter&#xD;
      a Single-blind, dietary-controlled baseline period and receive 1000 mg placebo or active drug&#xD;
      three times daily with meals (i.e., breakfast, lunch, and dinner) for 6 - 8 weeks. If the&#xD;
      qualify to continue, they will then receive up to 2000 mg of active or placebo drug for an&#xD;
      additional 14 weeks. Active drug will be given to 48 patients and placebo drug will be given&#xD;
      to 16 patients. However, neither the patients not the clinic staff will know which patients&#xD;
      are on active or placebo drug until the end of the study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility of a large,full-scale&#xD;
      study that would evaluate the regulating effects of TRIA-662 on serum triglycerides (TG) and&#xD;
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. In this study, patients will first enter&#xD;
      a Single-blind, dietary-controlled baseline period and receive 1000 mg placebo or active drug&#xD;
      three times daily with meals (i.e., breakfast, lunch, and dinner) for 6 - 8 weeks. Upon&#xD;
      completion of the 6 to 8 -week dietary-controlled baseline period, subjects meeting all&#xD;
      inclusion and no exclusion criteria will be randomized to the double-blind treatment period.&#xD;
      In the double-blind treatment period patients will be randomized such that at least 48&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized to TRIA-662 and at least 16 patients will be randomized to&#xD;
      placebo (3:1 ratio). The forced-dose titration will be achieved as follows: Weeks 1 - 2: Two&#xD;
      500 mg tablets three times daily with meals (total daily dose 3000 mg); Weeks 3 - 14: Two&#xD;
      1000 mg tablets three times daily with meals (total daily dose 6000 mg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational product will be administered three times daily with meals (i.e., breakfast,&#xD;
      lunch, and dinner). Down titration to 3000 mg daily (two 500 mg tablets, three times daily)&#xD;
      is allowed in the event that a patient cannot tolerate the 6000 mg daily treatment for the&#xD;
      stipulated period. Under this scenario, the down-titrated patient will remain on the&#xD;
      tolerated dose for the remainder of the study. Lipid and ancillary exploratory parameters&#xD;
      will be evaluated during the baseline period, upon randomization and throughout the active&#xD;
      treatment period. Throughout the study, patients must adhere to a heart-healthy diet, abstain&#xD;
      from/minimize ethyl alcohol intake and control any other variables that may alter serum lipid&#xD;
      levels (e.g., exercise, weight loss programs, drugs including over the counter agents&#xD;
      preparations that may alter serum lipid levels. Safety and tolerability will be assessed&#xD;
      throughout the trial through the evaluation of physical exams, electrocardiograms (ECGs),&#xD;
      routine hematology and blood chemistry testing, vital signs and adverse events.&#xD;
