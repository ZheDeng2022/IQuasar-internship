  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for a majority (approximately 85%) of lung cancer&#xD;
      cases. Patients with localized disease can be cured through surgery, but only 20 % are&#xD;
      operable.For the majority of patients with advanced disease, palliative cytotoxic&#xD;
      chemotherapy remains the recommended therapy. Chemotherapy prolongs survival and improves&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recommended first-line therapy is 4-6 courses of a platinum in combination with a third&#xD;
      generation compound (e.g. gemcitabine, vinorelbine, docetaxel, pemetrexed, paclitaxel). After&#xD;
      first-line therapy, it has been recommended to observe the patients and offer second-line&#xD;
      chemotherapy at disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regimens for second-line therapy include docetaxel or pemetrexed monotherapy. Pemetrexed is&#xD;
      less toxic and superior to gemcitabine in non-squamous NSCLC, whereas docetaxel is the&#xD;
      recommended second-line therapy in squamous cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the studies of maintenance pemetrexed therapy are encouraging; the observed&#xD;
      survival benefit is clinically relevant and relatively large considering the poor survival in&#xD;
      patients with advanced NSCLC. Furthermore, pemetrexed appears to be well tolerated. There&#xD;
      are, however, several limitations to the studies that have been conducted: Relatively few&#xD;
      elderly patients and no PS 2 patients were enrolled - and not all patients on the&#xD;
      control-arms received pemetrexed at progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this study is to investigate whether immediate maintenance pemetrexed&#xD;
      therapy prolongs survival compared to observation and pemetrexed therapy at progression in&#xD;
      patients with advanced NSCLC. Furthermore, it will be explored whether patients with&#xD;
      'performance status' 2 and elderly ≥ 70 years tolerate and benefit from maintenance therapy;&#xD;
      and what characteristics and blood biomarkers are associated with sensitivity and&#xD;
      tolerability of such therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In previous studies without maintenance therapy, median overall survival (OS) for performance&#xD;
      status (PS) 0-1 patients has been approximately 9 months, corresponding to 6 months from&#xD;
      randomization in this study. We consider an improvement in overall survival of two months to&#xD;
      be the minimum difference that will lead to routine use of maintenance pemetrexed in Norway.&#xD;
      To demonstrate an improvement in median overall survival from 6 to 8 months with an α =0.05&#xD;
      and β =0.20, 198 evaluable patients are required on each arm. We expect a drop-out rate of&#xD;
      maximum 10 %, and therefore intend to randomize a total of 436 patients (PS 0-1) - of which&#xD;
      we expect 150 to be 70 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size is calculated on PS 0-1 patients only. In addition, PS 2 patients will be&#xD;
      randomized until the required number of PS 0-1 patients have been accrued. We estimate that a&#xD;
      total of 100 PS 2 patients will be enrolled - sufficient for hypothesis-generating analyses&#xD;
      of the benefit of maintenance therapy in elderly and PS 2 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on experience from our previous studies we estimate that approximately 30% of patients&#xD;
      will not complete or progress during induction chemotherapy; or be ineligible due&#xD;
      deterioration of PS. Consequently, we need to include approximately 765 patients.&#xD;
