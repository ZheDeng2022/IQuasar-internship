    <textblock>
      Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is a test that can be performed at the time of heart&#xD;
      catheterization. It measures the change in pressure across a narrowing in the heart artery&#xD;
      during high flow situation, and provides reliable information about the functional severity&#xD;
      of the narrowing. FFR measurements accurately predict whether a stent is needed, and is&#xD;
      considered an excellent test before placement of stents to treat narrowed heart arteries.&#xD;
      However, FFR is not used in every case because of the extra time needed and the associated&#xD;
      device costs. Cardiac Services BC (an agency of Provincial Health Services Authority) is&#xD;
      sponsoring this study to find out if FFR should be used in most cases (routine), rather than&#xD;
      the current selective approach.&#xD;

      Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is an effective, less invasive mode of&#xD;
      revascularization compared with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). In 2011, a total of&#xD;
      7,614 PCI procedures were performed in British Columbia (BC). While some procedures were done&#xD;
      emergently for life-threatening indications (e.g. ST elevation myocardial infarction - STEMI&#xD;
      or cardiogenic shock), most (6,169 cases in year 2011) were done at the discretion of the&#xD;
      treating physicians, taking patient preference into account. A number of factors are usually&#xD;
      considered before proceeding with PCI. These may include clinical presentation (stable angina&#xD;
      versus acute coronary syndrome); severity of symptoms (asymptomatic or highly symptomatic);&#xD;
      response to medical therapy; severity of ischemia based on non-invasive functional testing&#xD;
      (mild, moderate, or severe); predicted risk (low, intermediate, or high); and findings on&#xD;
      coronary angiography (lesion number, location, severity, and morphology, etc). However,&#xD;
      interpretation of symptoms is subjective. Non-invasive tests for ischemia may not be&#xD;
      reliable. In addition, coronary angiography uses 2 dimensional images to depict 3-dimensional&#xD;
      structures, and there is well known limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concept of using fractional flow reserve (FFR) to predict the functional significance of&#xD;
      coronary lesions was described &gt; 20 years ago. In 1996, Pijls et al showed that measurements&#xD;
      of FFR in the cardiac catheterization laboratory can accurately predict provoked ischemia&#xD;
      upon non-invasive functional testing. The DEFER study (2007) showed that coronary lesions&#xD;
      with non-ischemic FFR values can be treated with medical therapy with good clinical outcome&#xD;
      at 5-year follow up. The FAME-1 study (2009) evaluated the strategy of PCI guided by&#xD;
      angiography versus PCI guided by FFR measurements in multi-vessel disease. The primary&#xD;
      end-point was the 1-year composite of death, myocardial infarction (MI), and any repeat&#xD;
      revascularization. Fewer stents were used per patient for the FFR-guided group (2.7 versus&#xD;
      1.9 stents per patient), less contrast agent used (302 versus 272 ml), and lower in-lab&#xD;
      equipment cost ($6,007 US versus $5,332 US), all significant with P&lt;0.001. A total of 1,005&#xD;
      patients were randomized. At 1-year follow up, the composite end-point of death, MI and&#xD;
      target vessel revascularization was 18.2% for the angiography-guided group versus 13.3% for&#xD;
      the FFR-guided group (p &lt; 0.02). At 2-year follow up, the incidence of death and MI was lower&#xD;
      for the FFR-guided group (12.7% versus 8.4%, p&lt;0.03), and the incidence of MI in the&#xD;
      FFR-guided and PCI deferred population was very low at 0.2%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the publication of the FAME-1 study, the use of pressure wires to measure FFR increased&#xD;
      from ~400 cases per year to ~1,000 cases per year in BC. However, in comparison with an&#xD;
      annual non-emergent PCI volume of &gt;6,000 cases per year, the use of FFR appears highly&#xD;
      selective (1,058 out of 6,169, 17%, based on year 2011 statistics). In a series of 442&#xD;
      consecutive FFR cases done at the Vancouver General and St. Paul's Hospitals (year 2011 to&#xD;
      2012), the use of FFR identified non-ischemic lesions in 52%, and this resulted in a change&#xD;
      in management decision in 68%. In addition, provincial data showed significant variation in&#xD;
      the use of FFR among the 5 PCI capable hospitals in BC (from &lt;5% to ~30%). Based on the&#xD;
      recent European Society of Cardiology guidelines, the use of FFR to guide revascularization&#xD;
      has a class 1a indication in multi-vessel disease, while the US guidelines (American College&#xD;
      of Cardiology, ACC) has a class 2a recommendation for the use of FFR in evaluating coronary&#xD;
      lesions of intermediate severity. It is possible that a highly selective approach to the use&#xD;
      of FFR may lead to underuse, which in turn may lead to overuse of PCI, with increased cost,&#xD;
      and adverse clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the routine use of FFR may improve clinical outcome, decrease the number&#xD;
      of PCI, and decrease direct cost in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. We propose a&#xD;
      randomized study to compare 2 approaches of using FFR to guide PCI: (1) routine use - the&#xD;
      experimental arm; and (2) selective use - the current standard.&#xD;
