      Our hypothesis is that an on-site mentoring program for staff at primary health care centers&#xD;
      in northern Karnataka, will improve the quality of maternal, neonatal and child health care,&#xD;
      and improve clinical outcomes.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      By providing on-site mentoring for improved clinical care and service delivery, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that the quality of services and care will improve and patients will have better&#xD;
      clinical outcomes. Specifically we believe that routine on-site clinical and service delivery&#xD;
      mentoring will strengthen clinical knowledge, skills and practices among staff nurses and&#xD;
      ANMs (in year 2), will strengthen appropriate referrals and follow up care, will improve&#xD;
      other aspects of service quality, and provider and client satisfaction. The evaluation will&#xD;
      assess change during the first year of the intervention that focuses on clinical mentoring of&#xD;
      staff nurses and on quality improvement in the PHCs as a whole. The evaluation will focus on&#xD;
      success indicators as shown in Appendix 1. Due to the short time frame for evaluation,&#xD;
      success indicators will be principally at the levels of inputs, outputs, and outcomes&#xD;
      focusing on adherence to the Sukshema Critical Care package, although we also hope to assess&#xD;
      some key health outcomes, in terms of reduction of &quot;near-miss&quot; cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Pre and post MM intervention evaluation strategy The &quot;pre-intervention&quot; evaluation will&#xD;
      have two phases. The first phase will take place in all 122 sites before any intervention&#xD;
      activities begin (Figure 1). This evaluation will focus on site readiness to provide quality&#xD;
      services, provider knowledge, attitudes and reported or observed (or simulated) practices,&#xD;
      supervision and mentoring, record keeping, and provider and client satisfaction. The NRHM SBA&#xD;
      guidelines, PHC 24/7 guidelines, MHFW NSSK guidelines, and the Sukshema critical care package&#xD;
      will all be used to determine expectations of clinical quality of care at this level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The focus of the first year of the MM intervention is enhanced clinical skills in the&#xD;
      intra-partum and postpartum periods and thus assessments of actual clinical practices are&#xD;
      important. However, data on actual practices in the intrapartum and postpartum periods will&#xD;
      be difficult to collect by observation during this baseline (especially those with&#xD;
      complications). Most of the PHCs conduct only a few deliveries each week, and it will be&#xD;
      therefore almost impossible to obtain a representative sample of observations. Therefore we&#xD;
      will assess intrapartum and postpartum clinical practices largely though the audit of case&#xD;
      sheets and registers. However, these case sheets are currently either not available or not&#xD;
      used. Thus our strategy necessitates delay of this part of the second phase of the baseline&#xD;
      until after the update training where all staff will be given and instructed in the use of&#xD;
      new and improved case sheets. All sites will be given the opportunity to practice using these&#xD;
      patient case sheets for one month before they are collected by project staff and used as a&#xD;
      basis for assessing both compliance with the new case sheets, adequacy of reporting, and&#xD;
      actual case management. Actual case observations will be done during routine MM visits where&#xD;
      possible. The post intervention phase of the assessment will take place in all sites once&#xD;
      year after the first (planned 6) MM visits and will repeat the baseline survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre and post MM intervention evaluation survey tools&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey will use four types of survey tools pre and post MM intervention and one&#xD;
      additional tool after one year in the intervention sites only:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A1. Questionnaires for all staff nurses on duty (including night duty) at the PHCs during the&#xD;
      evaluation that will assess knowledge of intrapartum, postpartum, newborn care and infection&#xD;
      prevention, and solicit provider perspectives on mentoring and supervision. In some cases,&#xD;
      the questions will be in the form of case studies or asking for simulated demonstrations of&#xD;
      practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A2. Facility audits and observations in all PHCs to assess site readiness to provide quality&#xD;
      services and provide checks of drugs used: equipment and drugs, staffing and training levels,&#xD;
      availability and correct use of case sheets, registers and referral slips. This tool will&#xD;
      also have a section for observing practices in the postnatal ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A3. Postpartum client questionnaires with all women who have delivered up to one month before&#xD;
      the survey traced to their homes that will assess client recall of information and services&#xD;
      given and client satisfaction. Delivery registers will be checked and all women who delivered&#xD;
      in the PHC n the previous month will be traced to their homes for interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A4. Case sheet and register audits for all cases for the one month before survey dates to&#xD;
      assess completeness of reporting and appropriate client management A5. Focus Group&#xD;
      Discussions with SNs in a sample of intervention PHCs: During the post MM intervention survey&#xD;
      we will conduct focus group discussions (FGDs) with staff at a selection of intervention&#xD;
      sites to understand their experiences with the MM intervention and to gather their&#xD;
      suggestions for improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: The field staff will consist of three supervisors per district, plus 13&#xD;
      teams of 2 interviewers, one of whom will manage the facility audits and staff surveys, and&#xD;
      one the postpartum client questionnaires for each of the 122 PHCs. It will be necessary for&#xD;
      each team to spend 2 days in each PHC, thus each team will be able to complete the survey&#xD;
      work in 3-4 weeks. Simultaneous data collection will be carried out in both districts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A week's training will be provided to the field teams that will include lectures on technical&#xD;
      topics, demonstration interviews, mock interviews and field practice. The training will be&#xD;
      provided to about 10% more persons than actually required for the survey, and the required&#xD;
      number will be selected based on their performance during the training. KHPT and SJMC staff&#xD;
      will conduct the training and will monitor the field work activities and quality of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data processing: Double data entry will be done at KHPT, who will prepare a report of the&#xD;
      pre-intervention survey and end-line survey comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Routine continuous monitoring: First, project staff will routinely document staffing,&#xD;
      training, financial and other project inputs, data that will be crucial for assessing the&#xD;
      feasibility of scale up to other districts. During bi-monthly MM visits, staff will have a&#xD;
      proscribed list of data to collect. As well as keeping details of staff at the sites their&#xD;
      training background and any clinical mentoring given, the mentors will have a proscribed list&#xD;
      of clinical skills to observe; wherever possible during their 3 day visits, they will observe&#xD;
      women in labour, after delivery and in the postpartum ward, and where this is not possible,&#xD;
      they will use models and case studies to assess staff skills. There will be continuous&#xD;
      monitoring of the MM interventions through reports of MM visits that will include:&#xD;
      documentation of visits through trip reports that detail facility meetings, talks given,&#xD;
      happenings in the PHC or area and notes on any morbidity and mortality discussions; completed&#xD;
      clinical competency checklists for mentored individuals. They will also photocopy the case&#xD;
      sheets, which will have been used as a basis for discussion during the visit and facility&#xD;
      action plans, for review by KHPT clinical staff. The case sheets will also be collected&#xD;
      quarterly from the control sites by the KHPT district staff. These staff will encourage use&#xD;
      of the case sheets at each of their quarterly visits without any additional training or&#xD;
      mentoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent Verbal, witnessed informed consent will be sought from the head of the PHC&#xD;
      who will be asked to give permission to survey the PHC; from staff nurses who will be&#xD;
      interviewed in the PHCs and from postnatal women traced to the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Districts and sites Using a matched (for client volume) case control strategy, the MM&#xD;
      intervention will be piloted and evaluated in PHCs in two districts, Gulbarga and Bellary&#xD;
      that have a total of 122 24x7 PHCs (Gulbarga 70; Bellary 52). Sixty one PHCs (Gulbarga 35;&#xD;
      Bellary 26) will be randomly assigned to an MM intervention or experimental group (stratified&#xD;
      by taluka and 6-monthly patient delivery load), while the rest will serve as control sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SBA + training The first part of the intervention involves all the 122 PHC 24/7 facilities in&#xD;
      the two districts for two reasons: first we feel that this training is generally needed and&#xD;
      will help to put the intervention and control site staff on the same level playing field in&#xD;
      terms of basic MNCH knowledge; second, we know from the Sukshema baseline survey conducted in&#xD;
      2011 that few staff use adequate reporting mechanisms such as case sheets. As these are&#xD;
      needed both programmatically as job aids, and for programme evaluative purposes, we will use&#xD;
      this training as an opportunity to introduce new case sheets. After the first phase of&#xD;
      baseline survey (described below) and before the mentoring programme begins in the&#xD;
      intervention sites, Sukshema project staff will conduct a 3 day training update (called SBA+)&#xD;
      for all staff nurses and a one day SBA+ for all M.O.'s from all 122 PHCs in the two&#xD;
      districts, irrespective of whether they have previously attended the NRHM Skilled Birth&#xD;
      Attendant (SBA) training. The 3 day training will focus on the essential components on&#xD;
      intra-partum and postpartum (mother and baby) care identified in the Sukshema critical care&#xD;
      package that evidence shows can significantly reduce maternal and newborn morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. The one day training for doctors will focus on identification of danger signs,&#xD;
      pre-referral management of complications, quality of care, case audits and improvement of&#xD;
      management and documentation. At these trainings, staff will be given, and instructed in the&#xD;
      use of enhanced case sheets for women and babies from labour through to discharge, including&#xD;
      use of the partograph. After this training, there will be no further interventions in the&#xD;
      control sites, except that Sukshema staff will visit every 3 months to collect copies of the&#xD;
      case sheets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling strategy The PHC intervention and control sites will be selected systematically in&#xD;
      each taluka, after stratification and matching by client volume per month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MNCH mentoring In each district MNCH mentors (MMs), a new staff cadre, will be recruited and&#xD;
      trained (Gulbarga 5; Bellary 4), each responsible for the intervention in 6-7&#xD;
      experimental/intervention PHCs. We will also train 3 additional MMs to act as a back-up (2 in&#xD;
      Gulbarga and one in Bellary), total 12 mentors. The MMs will attend some of the PHC staff&#xD;
      training but will also be trained for 4 weeks by project staff at St John's Medical College&#xD;
      in essential clinical competencies and in how to mentor staff in clinical skills, team&#xD;
      building and problem solving, service delivery improvement, as well as in how to be effective&#xD;
      mentors. The MNCH mentors will be senior nurses, selected based on specific criteria such as&#xD;
      clinical experience, training and mentoring abilities, and experience/familiarity with&#xD;
      government health systems. They will be guided by a Mentoring Coordinator in each district&#xD;
      who will support the mentors' activities and liaise between them, the PHCs, district&#xD;
      government staff and KHPT district staff. During the first year, the mentors will be trained&#xD;
      by the Project to (a) provide clinical mentoring in safe delivery to staff nurses by hands-on&#xD;
      coaching; (b) provide mentoring in how to improve the quality of services by building&#xD;
      teamwork and introducing problem solving initiatives to address other aspects of service&#xD;
      delivery (including especially referral processes); and in year 2 to mentor ANMs who will&#xD;
      come to the PHC during the MNCH mentor visits, in providing antenatal, postpartum and newborn&#xD;
      care, and referrals and follow up.&#xD;
