      The purpose of this research study is to determine if the study drug H.C. Acthar gel slows&#xD;
      the progression of your kidney disease. This drug is a steroid-based medicine with fewer side&#xD;
      effects than other steroids used for treatment of kidney diseases similar to APOL1&#xD;
      nephropathy.&#xD;
