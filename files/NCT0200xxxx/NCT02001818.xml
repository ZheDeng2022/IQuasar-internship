  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of CML and the expected survival has been revolutionised since the introduction&#xD;
      of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as nilotinib. Despite their effectiveness, these&#xD;
      drugs will never totally remove CML affected cells from the body. In order to achieve this&#xD;
      goal, and potentially enable CML patients to live without the daily need for TKIs, other&#xD;
      features of the patient's immune system may need to be harnessed. One possibility is using&#xD;
      externally administered interferon (IFN) to augment the response induced by the TKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the response in terms of length of survival, detection of minimal&#xD;
      disease levels and time until disease worsens in patients with chronic phase CML who are&#xD;
      taking nilotinib and pegylated Interferon. Patients will commence taking nilotinib for 3&#xD;
      months, and once tolerated, will simultaneously be treated with injected pegIFN for up to 2&#xD;
      years. Patients can continue taking nilotinib beyond this time providing they are receiving&#xD;
      benefit. Options are available for patients to decrease or increase their dose or to switch&#xD;
      to another TKI, imatinib, to ensure a balance between drug effectiveness and minimal side&#xD;
      effects is achieved.&#xD;

             employing an effective method of birth control. Male and female patients of&#xD;
             childbearing potential must agree to employ an effective method of birth control&#xD;
             throughout the study. The type of birth control is a decision which should be made&#xD;
             between the treating clinician and the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Known history of uncontrolled depression or any other psychiatric disease likely to be&#xD;
             exacerbated by study treatment. A formal psychiatric assessment at baseline is not&#xD;
             required.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Current participation in another therapeutic clinical trial (participation in clinical&#xD;
             trials that do not involve active interventions is not an exclusion for the study.)&#xD;
