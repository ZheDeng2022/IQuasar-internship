      This protocol is a prospective, open label, pilot study examining the utility of three&#xD;
      established pain questionnaires (the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Neck Disability Index&#xD;
      (NDI), the Oswestry Low Back Pain Questionnaire and two novel pain scale devised by the PI)&#xD;
      as well as their relationship to three novel quantitative tools to measure the effect of&#xD;
      botulinum toxin injections for neck pain and back pain. The three novel methods for measuring&#xD;
      neurotoxin effect are: muscle twitch patterns using surface electromyography (sEMG), cervical&#xD;
      and lumbar range of motion using a neck and low back inclinometer, and skin surface&#xD;
      temperature readings using an infrared imaging camera.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Botulinum toxins are a well-established group of neurotoxins that have a wide variety of FDA&#xD;
      approved clinical uses including muscle relaxation, headache prevention and bladder control.&#xD;
      Despite the abundance of anecdotal evidence supporting their use in pain management, double&#xD;
      blind placebo control studies examining the efficacy of botulinum toxins in the treatment of&#xD;
      chronic neck and back pain have reported mixed findings. Several smaller studies have shown&#xD;
      significantly positive outcomes while other studies have found no efficacy of neurotoxins&#xD;
      compared to placebo. The existing literature reveals that most negative outcome studies were&#xD;
      based on the Visual Analogue Scale, which is a purely subjective measure. We propose a more&#xD;
      objective set of measures that might better reflect patients' deficits and levels of&#xD;
      discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our proposal is a prospective, open-label, pilot study that will examine chronic neck and&#xD;
      back pain among veterans. Our primary specific aim is to test three novel methods for&#xD;
      evaluating clinical deficits in patients who have chronic neck and back pain:&#xD;
      electromyographical (EMG) activity (primary outcome) and cervical/lumbar range of motion&#xD;
      (CROM &amp; LROM) (primary outcome) as well as skin surface temperature (thermography) (secondary&#xD;
      outcome). Our hypothesis is that most patients with chronic neck and back pain significantly&#xD;
      from sustained muscle spasms. As a result, patients may exhibit surplus EMG activity in&#xD;
      affected areas due to spontaneous muscle twitch. And consequently, they may show signs of&#xD;
      decreased range of motion due to increased muscle tone. They may also experience a rise in&#xD;
      skin surface temperature due to excess heat production from sustained muscle contraction. We&#xD;
      will measure these three phenomena using three different biophysical measurement tools.&#xD;
      Electromyographic data will be collected with a surface EMG device, and cervical and lumbar&#xD;
      range of motion with a gravity inclinometer. Skin surface temperature will be assessed with a&#xD;
      medical grade digital thermography camera.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second specific aim of this study is to examine the efficacy of botulinum toxins in&#xD;
      reversing the anomalies in the above measured parameters: to reduce excessive&#xD;
      electromyographic activity, to increase range of motion in cervical and lumbar joints and to&#xD;
      reduce elevated skin surface temperature. We will measure outcomes of 60 study subjects (30&#xD;
      for neck pain and 30 for low back pain) who will all be treated once with botulinum toxins&#xD;
      and then followed up at 1 month, 2 months and 3 months. We will also correlate our findings&#xD;
      with the more commonly used pain and function scales: the Visual Analogue Scale, Neck&#xD;
      Disability Index and the Oswestry Low Back Pain Scale.&#xD;
