    <textblock>
      The number of studies concerning health related quality of life (HRQL) in children with food&#xD;
      allergy is very limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only one study to date has compared HRQL of a group of children with food allergy to data&#xD;
      published on general population and other chronic diseases. This study concluded to lowest&#xD;
      HRQL scores in food allergic children compared to type 1 diabetes mellitus with important&#xD;
      impact on scores concerning social activities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare generic HRQL score in children with food allergy with other chronic diseases and&#xD;
      with healthy chidren in an homogeneous socio-cultural context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare generic and specific HRQL scores in children with food allergy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identifify in chidren with food allergy, clinical factrors assocated with lowest scores&#xD;
           in order to improve our management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generic HRQL questionnaire (CHQ-87) will be distributed :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  after hospital consultation for patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  in schools for healthy children A specific HRQL questionnaire (FAQLQ-CF or TF) and the &quot;&#xD;
           Food Allergy Independent Measure &quot; will also distributed to chidren with food allergy.&#xD;
