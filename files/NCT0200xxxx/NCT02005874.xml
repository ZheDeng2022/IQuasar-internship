    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to collect valuable data on the role of controlled humidity,&#xD;
      temperature, airflow, and visual tasking in altering the tear film protein composition. The&#xD;
      results from this preliminary study will help to explore the role of tear film markers in&#xD;
      inflammatory and disease conditions. This can also be extended to understand the role of the&#xD;
      tear film in protecting the ocular surface when individuals are exposed to low humidity&#xD;
      environments which may incite discomfort symptoms.&#xD;

      An investigational study, to evaluate the effects of a low humidity environment and visual&#xD;
      tasking on tear film protein composition Screening Visit 1A: Subjects will be screened based&#xD;
      on their medical history, symptom questionnaires (e.g. OSDI) and a full ophthalmic&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit 1A: Subjects will be screened based on their medical history, symptom&#xD;
      questionnaires (e.g. OSDI) and a full ophthalmic examination which will include baseline&#xD;
      measures including visual acuity and biomicroscopic evaluations of the anterior segment (i.e.&#xD;
      Tear Break Up Time (TBUT), corneal and conjunctival staining, lid wiper epitheliopathy,&#xD;
      conjunctival redness and tear film evaluation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-screening, approximately sixteen (16) subjects, meeting the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria, will be asked to participate in the study. Of those enrolled in the study,&#xD;
      approximately eight (8) subjects will have mild to moderate symptoms and signs of dry eye&#xD;
      syndrome and approximately eight (8) subject will not have signs or symptoms of dry eye&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Visit IB, subjects will have VA and biomicroscopy performed. A basal tear sample of&#xD;
      approximately 5 µL will be collected via capillary tubes from the outer canthus of each eye&#xD;
      and stored on dry ice then placed in a -80c ± 10°C freezer for storage. Photographic&#xD;
      assessments of the ocular surface may be taken. After waiting 5 minutes for the tear film to&#xD;
      stabilize, tear osmolarity may be measured in each eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to entered the low humidity Environmental Exposure Chamber (EEC), subjects will be&#xD;
      asked to fill out their baseline symptoms. Subjects will then enter and remain in the EEC for&#xD;
      approximately 180 minutes and symptom diary cards will be completed after entry at&#xD;
      pre-specified timepoints. Throughout the EEC visit, subjects will be asked to complete visual&#xD;
      tasks on a digital screen to ensure the ocular surface is exposed to the airflow and humidity&#xD;
      levels in the room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After approximately 180 minutes of exposure to dry eye conditions, prior to exiting chamber,&#xD;
      basal tears will be collected via capillary tubes for each eye and stored on dry ice then&#xD;
      placed in a -80°C ± 10°C freezer for storage. Photographic assessments of the ocular surface&#xD;
      may be taken. After waiting 5 minutes for the tear film to stabilize, tear osmolarity may be&#xD;
      measured for each eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After exiting the EEC, subjects will remain in the medical clinic for an additional 60&#xD;
      minutes and will continue to conduct visual tasks during this period. Symptom diary cards&#xD;
      will then be completed at pre-specified time points after leaving the EEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following 60 minutes in the clinic and prior to study exit, a final collection of basal tears&#xD;
      via capillary tubes will be taken and stored on dry ice and then placed in a -80°C ± 10°C&#xD;
      freezer for storage. Once again photographic assessments may be taken. Biomicroscopy will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tear samples collected before and after exposure to the chamber will be taken from&#xD;
      (-80°C) freezer storage and packaged on dry ice for shipment to the University of Waterloo&#xD;
      Centre for Contact Lens Research (CCLR) for analysis. A variety of proteins and cytokines&#xD;
      will be analyzed.&#xD;
