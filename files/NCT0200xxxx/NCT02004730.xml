      REGISTRY OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the procedural as well as the long-term clinical performance of the ABSORB&#xD;
      technology in patients with an indication to percutaneous coronary intervention for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. multivessel disease (at least two significant stenosis in 2 different coronary&#xD;
           arteries), or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. long (&gt;24 mm) single vessel disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
           REGISTRY FLOW AND CLINICAL FOLLOW-UP SCHEDULE&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Italian National Registry is a prospective multi-center nation-wide registry&#xD;
           evaluating the safety and clinical outcomes of the Absorb BVS in daily use in patients&#xD;
           with de novo lesions in previously untreated vessels with indication to PCI for&#xD;
           multivessel or long single coronary artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Indications, however, are per the most recent Absorb IFU.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Number of Patients to be Registered and Patient Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Italian National Registry will enroll a of 1000 patients in approximately 50 sites&#xD;
           throughout the Italian territory where Absorb BVS has regulatory approval and is&#xD;
           commercially available.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will have clinical follow-up by telephone contact or office visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Measures Taken to Avoid and Minimize Bias&#xD;
&#xD;
           In order to minimize bias in assessing MACE outcomes, these events will be adjudicated&#xD;
           by an independent committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clinical follow-up plan: 30 days, 6 months, 1 year, and then yearly up to 5 years after&#xD;
           the index procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           OUTCOMES/ENDPOINTS&#xD;
&#xD;
           Outcomes are as specified below:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary outcome is set at 1 year: the cumulative hierarchical incidence of major adverse&#xD;
           cardiac events (MACE) defined as: cardiac death, non-fatal target vessel myocardial&#xD;
           infarction (MI), or clinically driven target lesion revascularization (TLR);&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary endpoints are set at 1 year: All causes mortality, clinically driven TLR,&#xD;
           clinically driven target vessel revascularization (TVR), any revascularisation (non TLR,&#xD;
           non TVR) and ARC-defined stent thrombosis, at any time point. Any type of angina post&#xD;
           procedure measured by means of the Cardio Test, proposed by the ANMCO (Associazione&#xD;
           Nazionale Medici Cardiologic Ospedalieri) [21]&#xD;
&#xD;
           Efficacy parameters: TLR and TVR at 1 year and then yearly up to 5-year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Safety &quot;patient oriented&quot; parameters: at 1 year and then yearly up to 5 years all cause&#xD;
           mortality, any myocardial infarction, Stent thrombosis based on the ARC classification,&#xD;
           up to 5-year follow-up. Data on dual antiplatelet therapy use will also be collected and&#xD;
           analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           PATIENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patient Population&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients enrolled into this registry will be male and female patients derived from the&#xD;
           general interventional cardiology population who satisfy the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
           criteria. The Italian National Registry will enroll 1000 patients in approximately 50&#xD;
           sites throughout the national terrritory.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Informed Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Investigator or designee, who has been trained on the protocol, will explain the&#xD;
           nature and scope of the registry and inform the patient of the potential risks and&#xD;
           benefits of participation, and document consent to treatment with an Absorb BVS device&#xD;
           according to standard hospital practice. For this registry the patient must consent to&#xD;
           data collection and follow-up visits. All patients (or legally authorized patients'&#xD;
           representatives if applicable) must sign, date and time Medical Ethics Committee (MEC)&#xD;
           approved informed consent prior to data collection for this registry. Obtaining the&#xD;
           consent, provision of a copy to the patient, along with the date and time must be&#xD;
           documented in the patient's medical records. The informed consent form must be signed by&#xD;
           the investigator. In addition, the signed informed consent must be kept in the patient's&#xD;
           medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Eligibility Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
           General Eligibility Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
           Assessment for general eligibility criteria is based on medical records of the site and&#xD;
           interview with a candidate patient. Patients must meet at least one of the angiographic&#xD;
           inclusion criteria to be considered for the registry. If ANY of the exclusion criteria&#xD;
           is met, the patient is excluded from the clinical evaluation and cannot be registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patient Discontinuation&#xD;
&#xD;
           Once registered, each patient shall remain in the registry until completion of the&#xD;
           required follow-up period; however, a patient's participation is voluntary and the&#xD;
           patient has the right to withdraw at any time without penalty or loss of benefit.&#xD;
           Conceivable reasons for discontinuation may include but not be limited to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient voluntary withdrawal&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient withdrawal by physician as clinically-indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient lost-to-follow-up: If the patient misses two consecutive scheduled follow&#xD;
                up time points, and attempts at contacting the patient are unsuccessful, then the&#xD;
                patient is considered lost to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
           No additional data is needed and will be recorded from patients once withdrawn from the&#xD;
           registry. Patients will not be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Registry Completion&#xD;
&#xD;
           An eCRF registry completion form must be completed when:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the patient is considered lost-to-follow-up per the above definition or&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the patient withdraws from the registry or&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the investigator withdraws the patient from the registry or&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the patient's follow-up is terminated upon registry follow-up completed&#xD;
&#xD;
           TREATMENT AND SCHEDULE OF EVENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
           The treatment strategy will be determined by the investigator. It is required that each&#xD;
           enrolling investigator review the most recent Absorb BVS IFU and assess the&#xD;
           contraindications, warnings and precaution sections with respect to the risks and&#xD;
           benefits for treating potential patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the procedure, patients will receive appropriate anticoagulation and other&#xD;
           therapies according to standard hospital practice. The Absorb BVS will be inspected,&#xD;
           prepared, and implanted according to the IFU.&#xD;
&#xD;
           QCA analysis is recommended pre implantation of the ABSORB, for correct sizing. IVUS,&#xD;
           VH-IVUS and OCT techniques are encouraged: these imaging tools will be subject of&#xD;
           subgroup analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Post-procedure (In-hospital)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Post procedure data will be collected as per eCRF&#xD;
&#xD;
           Follow-up Antiplatelet Medications&#xD;
&#xD;
           A minimum of 6 months duration of DAPT is recommended. Specific type of DAPT will be&#xD;
           recorded as per eCRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clinical Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clinical follow-up visits by telephone contact or office visits per the following&#xD;
           schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  30 days: office visit is encouraged&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  6 months: office visit is encouraged&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  1 year, and then yearly up to 5 years after the index procedure: office visit is&#xD;
                encouraged.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Angiographic follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
           The angiographic follow up will be clinically driven. However, patients undergoing angio&#xD;
           follow up and IVUS or OCT follow up will be included in subgroup analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ADJUDICATION OF EVENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
           In order to minimize bias in assessing MACE outcomes, these events will be adjudicated&#xD;
           by an independent Clinical Event Committee, which will also act as Data Safety and&#xD;
           Monitoring Board for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistical Overview&#xD;
&#xD;
           The data will be reviewed by a Data Safety and Monitoring Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Data Safety and Monitoring Board will be also responsible for:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Determining whether information collected are sufficient to address the objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Recommending modifications to the statistical analysis plan to address additional&#xD;
                research questions based on review of the data&#xD;
&#xD;
           Analysis Population&#xD;
&#xD;
           All patients who are successfully registered will be included in the analysis. A limit&#xD;
           of one third of the entire population will be set for the group of Multivessel Disease&#xD;
           patients treated with ABSORB and a conventional stent (&quot;hybrid group&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample Size Calculations and Assumptions&#xD;
&#xD;
           Being this an observational registry aiming at quantifying effect estimates without&#xD;
           direct comparisons to literature benchmarks, we relied on confidence interval profiling&#xD;
           for sample size justification, without proceeding with formal power analysis. As the&#xD;
           main analysis is a pooled analysis of patients with multivessel disease and/or long&#xD;
           lesions, an overall and comprehensive analysis is planned as the primary analytical&#xD;
           approach. Accordingly, we computed that a target sample of 1000 patients will enable the&#xD;
           computation of reasonably precise 95% confidence intervals. Specifically, assuming a&#xD;
           4.2% MACE rate at 1 year (in keeping with ABSORBD EXTEND data), confidence intervals&#xD;
           computed with the adjusted Wald method would be 3.1% to 5.6% for a 1000-patient sample&#xD;
           (point estimate 42/1000 [4.2%]).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Given that the registry aims to reflect real-world patients and practice, no provision&#xD;
           to limit or restrict patient enrolment depending on the presence of multivessel disease&#xD;
           vs long lesions is envisioned.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistical Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
           Continuous endpoints will be summarized by presenting the total number of patients,&#xD;
           mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. Tabulation of categorical&#xD;
           parameters will include counts and percentages. The outcomes will be summarized as both&#xD;
           a discrete and a continuous variable using the method described above. Survival analysis&#xD;
           will be performed with the Kaplan-Meier method. Statistical inference will be based on&#xD;
           the computation of 95% confidence intervals using the adjusted Wald method. Additional&#xD;
           analyses will involve key subgroups defined according to baseline, lesion, and&#xD;
           procedural features, with statistical significance set at the 5% 2-tailed level.&#xD;
           Specifically, Student t, Fisher exact, and log-rank tests will be used for such&#xD;
           bivariate analyses, whereas multivariable linear regression, logistic regression, and&#xD;
           Cox proportional hazard analyses will be used to adjust for confounders. In addition,&#xD;
           separate analyses for patients with only multivessel disease, patients with only long&#xD;
           lesions, and patients with hybrid revascularization will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           DIRECT ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigator/institution will permit direct access to source data/documents in order&#xD;
           for registry-related monitoring, audits, MEC review, and regulatory inspections to be&#xD;
           performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           As part of the informed consent, the investigator or designee will obtain permission for&#xD;
           registry monitors or regulatory authorities to review, in confidence, any records&#xD;
           identifying the patients in this registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
           QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
           Protocol and Informed Consent Approval The Principal Investigator at each site must&#xD;
           confirm and agree with the content of the protocol prior to participation in this&#xD;
           registry. Also, the Principal Investigator will obtain written approval of the protocol,&#xD;
           informed consent form, and other registry related documents from the MEC. In addition,&#xD;
           the investigator will take actions necessary for ongoing registry approval at their site&#xD;
           per established procedures of the MEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigator will advise the MEC of the progress of this registry on a regular basis&#xD;
           until registry completion as required by the MEC.&#xD;
&#xD;

           informed consent form changes and obtain written MEC approval prior to implementation as&#xD;
           required by the MEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
           A monitoring plan will be established. Remote monitoring by the CRO and source documents&#xD;
           analysis for events throughout the study period by an independent Event Committee, will&#xD;
           be conducted to ensure compliance with the protocol and applicable regulatory&#xD;
           requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
           DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING&#xD;
&#xD;
           For the registry duration, the investigator will maintain complete and accurate&#xD;
           documentation including but not limited to the following: medical records, registry&#xD;
           progress records, laboratory reports, electronic case report forms, signed informed&#xD;
           consent forms, device serial numbers for monitoring malfunctions, correspondence with&#xD;
           the MEC and registry monitor/Sponsor, SAE reports, and information regarding patient&#xD;
