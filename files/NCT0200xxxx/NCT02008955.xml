  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the requirement for lysine in men and women over the age of 60&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seven different levels of lysine intake will be tested in each subject in random order. Each&#xD;
      level of lysine intake will involve a 3-day maintenance diet, with measures (breath, urine,&#xD;
      and blood samples) being collected on the third.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lysine is an amino acid that is essential in the diet. In our body, lysine makes up protein.&#xD;
      It is known that as people get older, over the age of 60, our body goes through many changes&#xD;
      such as increase in fat mass and decrease in lean mass such as muscle. This is why we are&#xD;
      studying how much of the essential amino acid, lysine, the body needs at this particular age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO) method is a minimally invasive method for&#xD;
      determining essential amino acid requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As essential amino acids cannot be stored in the body, they are either partitioned into&#xD;
      protein synthesis or oxidized if in excess. The premise of the IAAO is that when any&#xD;
      essential amino acid is limiting in the body then all other amino acids lose their ability to&#xD;
      contribute to protein synthesis and are instead oxidized. The method therefore involves&#xD;
      providing graded intakes (from deficient to excess) of the test amino acid, lysine, and then&#xD;
      measuring the oxidation of another amino acid, which is called the indicator amino acid. This&#xD;
      is done by isotopically labelling the indicator amino acid (13C- phenylalanine) and then&#xD;
      measuring the appearance of labelled carbon dioxide (13CO2) in breath with the different&#xD;
      intakes of the test amino acid, lysine. The requirement for lysine will be determined by the&#xD;
      &quot;breakpoint&quot; - the point at which oxidation of 13C- phenylalanine will plateau.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the study, participants will first participate in a pre-study assessment in which height,&#xD;
      weight, body composition (fat mass and muscle mass) and resting energy expenditure and&#xD;
      medical history will be assessed. Also, 5 ml of blood will be collected to test for diabetes&#xD;
      and kidney function. The purpose of the pre-assessment is to calculate the participant's&#xD;
      dietary requirements for the study, and to assess health status, activity level and dietary&#xD;
      patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then participate in up to 7 different 3-day studies that will be separated&#xD;
      by a minimum of 1 week between each 3-day study. The first 2 days are adaptation days and&#xD;
      participants will consumed the maintenance diet at home as 4 equal meals. The 3rd day is&#xD;
      called a study day and participants will consumed 8 hourly formulas; the first 3 are consumed&#xD;
      at home and the remaining 5 are consumed at the Clinical Research Centre at the Hospital for&#xD;
      Sick Children. Immediately after the 4th meal, 4 baseline breath and 3 baseline urine samples&#xD;
      are collected over the period of an hour. After the 5th meal, rate of carbon dioxide&#xD;
      production (VCO2) is measured by indirect calorimetry for a period of 20 minutes. The 5th,&#xD;
      6th, 7th, and 8th meal will contain a small amount of isotope labelled phenylalanine (13C&#xD;
      phenylalanine). Two and a half hours after the isotope (13C phenylalanine) is given (between&#xD;
      meal 7 and 8) 4 plateau breath and 3 plateau urine samples are collected for a period of an&#xD;
      hour. Between the 7th and 8th meal, a 15 ml blood sample will be taken - 10 ml will be used&#xD;
      to check for glucose and insulin levels and the remaining 5 ml for amino acid analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breath samples are used to measure the enrichment of isotopic labelled CO2 (13CO2). Urine&#xD;
      samples are used to measure the enrichment of isotopic labelled phenylalanine (13C&#xD;
      phenylalanine). Through a series of calculations and applying a two-phase regression&#xD;
      analysis, we will be able to determine the requirement for lysine.&#xD;
