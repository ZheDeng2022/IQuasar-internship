      This is a Clinical study Phase III, Prospective, Randomized, Controlled, Double-blind,&#xD;
      Multicenter, National, Non-inferiority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Its purpose is to determine the noninferiority in efficacy of an investigational product in&#xD;
      relation to the product available in the market intended of treating pressure ulcers.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of efficacy is the reduction in the area of devitalized tissue based on&#xD;
      the photographic record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to evaluate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  formation of granulation tissue;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the lesion reduction during treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the healing process of the Pressure Ulcer (PU) range of PUSH;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the safety of the investigational product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimated 92 research participants;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aged between ≥ 18 years and ≤ 80 years - both sexes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visits from 1 to 10;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The maximum lasting period in the study for each research participant will be&#xD;
           approximately four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations During Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of Digital Photography: The digital photographic record can provide the relative&#xD;
      size of the wound, the tissue color and condition of the surrounding skin. The evaluation of&#xD;
      digital photograph of each research participant will be performed by the classification&#xD;
      assigned to the decrease of devitalized area and tissue e repair related to the time of&#xD;
      healing and observed the formation of granulation tissue and epithelialization from&#xD;
      standardized photographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation by PUSH Scales:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to provide an evaluation instrument of PUs in Brazil, so that satisfies the&#xD;
      simplicity of the use in different clinical scenarios keeping its measurement properties, as&#xD;
      previously attested from its original version, the PUSH scale was adapted into Portuguese.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PUSH Scale considers three parameters or sub - scales of the wound healing process and&#xD;
      treatment outcomes: wound area, amount of exudate present on the wound, appearance of the&#xD;
      wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retention of Records:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator shall retain all documentation of the study over a period of at least five&#xD;
      years from the end of the study. The Sponsor or its designee will provide a list of all&#xD;
      documentation which should be kept by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All aspects of the study will be carefully monitored by Cristália Pharmaceutical Chemicals&#xD;
      Ltda. or designated representative of it (Clinical Research Organization - CRO) for&#xD;
      evaluations related to good clinical practice and applicable local regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case Report Forms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Monitor will be available if the investigator, or other person of his team, needs&#xD;
      information and guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Monitor of the study should have permanent access to all documentation and it is his&#xD;
      obligation to ensure that the Case Report Forms are complete and completed correctly, as well&#xD;
      as checking if the data are described according to the source documents, in order to&#xD;
      eliminate interferences that may compromise the accuracy of the data generated in the&#xD;
      clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Audit and Inspections:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Authorized representatives of the Sponsor or designees, regulatory authority or the Ethics&#xD;
      Committee of the institution may conduct audits or inspections during or after the study&#xD;
      conclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collecting Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information corresponding to the data of interest from the study will be collected and&#xD;
      recorded in Case Report forms provided by Sponsor, and filled from the information contained&#xD;
      in the source documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Documents are considered sources for study: medical records used by the professional at the&#xD;
      time of the visits, diagnostic tests or image.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent of Trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Principal Investigator will ensure that the research participant receive verbally and in&#xD;
      writing all relevant information about the nature, purpose, the test drug, the possible risks&#xD;
      and benefits of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research participants will be notified that they are free to discontinue the study at any&#xD;
      time. That they will have the opportunity to ask questions and to have sufficient time to&#xD;
      consider the information received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Formation of the database:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The database of the study will be assembled with the data from the Case Report Forms. Doubts&#xD;
      and discrepancies will generate questions (queries) written to the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
