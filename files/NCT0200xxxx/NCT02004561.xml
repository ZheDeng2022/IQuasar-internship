    <textblock>
      Determine the short and long term safety and efficacy of the Gastric bypass , laparoscopic&#xD;
      sleeve gastrectomy, and Gastric banding (LAGB) on severely obese adolescents. The procedure&#xD;
      selection is made by the patient or patient and guardian. This is not a randomized trial.&#xD;

      Twenty-six obese adolescents with plans to undergo bariatric surgery for clinical treatment&#xD;
      will be recruited for research study during screening process at the Yale Adolescent&#xD;
      Bariatric Surgery Clinic. After the appropriate discussion with surgeon, the choice of&#xD;
      procedure will be made by subject and legal guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every bariatric patient must have completed the thorough six-month evaluation period&#xD;
      established by the Yale's Adolescent Bariatric Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This standard of care pre-operative testing provides as a screening tool to ensure every&#xD;
      adolescent bariatric patient is mentally and physically appropriate for this surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monthly visits with clinician (Pediatric Obesity/Diabetology Expert) and dietician to&#xD;
           discuss lifestyle change management and anthropometric measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychiatrist or psychologist to screen for depression, uncontrollable psychosis,&#xD;
           suicidal ideation, and hostile or unsupportive family environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone age will be obtained to ensure subject has reached or near full growth potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pediatric Cardiology for echocardiogram to rule out left ventricular hypertrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral glucose tolerance test to assess glucose status and degree of insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood work to assess hepatic and kidney function, nutritional deficiencies, hormonal&#xD;
           profile, and hyperlipidemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pediatric Pulmonary for sleep study and Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs) to rule out&#xD;
           obstructive sleep apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a subject is approved for surgery, he or she will meet with Bariatric Surgeon to discuss&#xD;
      benefits and risks of each bariatric surgery. After the appropriate discussion with surgeon,&#xD;
      the choice of procedure will be made by subject and legal guardian. For research purposes, we&#xD;
      seek to monitor the progress of the patients enrolled in Yale's Adolescent Bariatric Surgery&#xD;
      Clinic. Collecting pre and post long term operative data will allow us to describe this&#xD;
      efficacy and potential complications that arise with RYGB vs LAGB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As standard of care, all subjects will have undergone pre-operative testing established by&#xD;
      Adolescent Bariatric Surgery Clinic before any of the bariatric surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For research purposes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Month prior to Surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Abdominal MRI (weight must not exceed 140 kg)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  DNA blood extraction&#xD;
&#xD;
           During RYGB or LAGB Surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Liver Biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Visceral (omental fat) and Subcutaneous Fat Biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data collection will continue for 24 months post-operatively and include both research&#xD;
           testing and standard of care clinical appointments.&#xD;

      Anthropometric Measures and HBA1c Anthropometric measures will be done at study enrollment,&#xD;
      monthly leading up to the surgery RYGB or LAGB, and 2 weeks, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, 12&#xD;
      months and 24 months post operatively. These measures include height, weight, BMI, BMI Z&#xD;
      score, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, resting heart rate, % fat mass, and total fat&#xD;
      mass. Demographic data includes ethnicity and family income. HbA1c will be completed at the&#xD;
      3, 6 , 12, and 24 month post operative time period.&#xD;
