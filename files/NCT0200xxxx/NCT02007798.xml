  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An excellent recovery profile is critical for neurosurgical anesthesia. Rapid awakening,&#xD;
      smooth blood pressure and heart rate (HR), a higher degree of coordination, painless or mild&#xD;
      pain, as well as better tolerance to endotracheal intubation can avoid can increased&#xD;
      intracranial pressure, elevated blood pressure and rapid HR caused by emergency choking,&#xD;
      suffocation and agitation, and can reduce postoperative cerebral edema and the risk of&#xD;
      bleeding. In addition, it is easy for surgeons to timely evaluate postoperative patients'&#xD;
      neurologic function based on the excellent recovery from anesthesia. Up to now, there are&#xD;
      many methods and drugs to improve the quality of recovery period, but each of them has some&#xD;
      flaws. Dexmedetomidine, an emerging anesthetic adjuvant, exhibits a stable hemodynamic&#xD;
      recovery period, and cannot affect evaluation of neurological function with both the sedative&#xD;
      and analgesic effects. We propose the following hypotheses: (1) A small dose of&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine can be intravenously injected into patients subjected to craniotomy under&#xD;
      general anesthesia, in order to improve the recovery profiles and reduce the incidence of&#xD;
      emergence agitation. (2) Dexmedetomidine can reduce postoperative pain.&#xD;

      Study Arm(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment There are totally 150 cases, 50 cases in each group. At least 120 cases complete&#xD;
      the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized grouping Under the guidance of a drug administrator, the different drug and&#xD;
      control groups are randomly encoded. Each code has a corresponding emergency envelope. Blind&#xD;
      codes are saved by the drug administrator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Drugs Dexmedetomidine (SFDA Approval No. H20090248), 200 ug/2 ml, provided by&#xD;
      the Central Pharmacy of the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University and&#xD;
      produced by Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co., Ltd., China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal saline, 100 ml per bag, provided by the the Central Pharmacy of the First Affiliated&#xD;
      Hospital of China Medical University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Information: Dexmedetomidine is an α-adrenoceptor agonist, and its chemical name&#xD;
      is (+)-4-(S)-[1-(2,3-dimethylphenyl ) ethyl]-1H-imidazole hydrochloride. Its structure and&#xD;
      pharmacological activity are similar to clonidine. Dexmedetomidine was developed by the Orion&#xD;
      Pharma (Finland) Corporation and Abott (USA), and introduced to China in 2009 (trade name: Ai&#xD;
      Beining). Preclinical studies have shown that, like clonidine, dexmedetomidine is an agonist&#xD;
      of α2-adrenergic receptors, and exhibits effectiveness about 10 times more than clonidine.&#xD;
      Originally developed as an antihypertensive drug, dexmedetomidine functions in lowering blood&#xD;
      pressure and HR, and is found to have a powerful anesthetic effect. Up to now,&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine has been widely used in general anesthesia, monitored anesthesia care (MAC),&#xD;
      ICU sedation. Dexmedetomidine is a sedative, hypnotic, analgesic, anti-sympathetic&#xD;
      medication, and uniquely characterized as &quot;cooperative sedation&quot; and &quot;no respiratory&#xD;
      depression&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, we compare the hemodynamic effects of different doses of&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine via intraoperative infusion, and explore the effects of dexmedetomidine on&#xD;
      recovery profiles from general anesthesia and postoperative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized double-blinded trial. All the subjects are supratentorial brain&#xD;
      tumors patients with ASA I &amp; II. Within 24 hours before surgery, preoperative visits are&#xD;
      conducted to obtain signed informed consents. The patient's height, weight, blood pressure&#xD;
      (including SBP, DBP and mean arterial pressure (MAP)), HR, oxygen saturation (SpO2) are&#xD;
      recorded as the baseline value (BV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are subjected to electrocardiograph monitoring, including non-invasive blood&#xD;
      pressure, ECG, and SpO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia is orderly induced by a combined infusion of propofol 2-2.5 mg/kg, sufentanil&#xD;
      0.3-0.5 ug/kg, and cis-atracurium 0.15-0.2 mg/kg, and the tracheal intubation is completed&#xD;
      until the maximal muscle relaxant effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before surgery, arterial and central venous catheterization is completed for continuous&#xD;
      monitoring of the patient's arterial pressure and central venous pressure (CVP).&#xD;
      Intraoperative CVP is maintained at 4-6 cmH2O.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia is maintained at a manner of inhalation anesthesia with 0.8-1.5% sevoflurane and&#xD;
      continuous intravenous infusion of propofol and remifentanil respectively at a speed of 3-5&#xD;
      mg/kg/h and 0.01-0.02 mg /kg/h. The drug dose is adjusted hemodynamically to maintain MAP&#xD;
      values at a range of 60-90 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After craniectomy, additional cis-atracurium 0.05-0.08 mg/kg is added every 45-60 minutes by&#xD;
      the end of dural suturing. Sufentanil (0.15-0.2 ug/kg) is given intravenously instead of&#xD;
      inhalation anesthesia, and meanwhile, 20% -30% dose of intravenous anesthesia is added. After&#xD;
      skin closure (approximately 30 minutes before the end of surgery), continuous infusion of&#xD;
      propofol is terminated, and remifentanil infusion is stopped after surgery. Intraoperative&#xD;
      dexamethasone (20 mg) is routinely used for prevention of cerebral edema, 10 mg is&#xD;
      administered intravenously before surgery (10 mg), and then an additional 10 mg injected&#xD;
      after 2 hours or by the end of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infusion principles: before anesthesia, crystalloid solution is dropped at a speed of 8-10&#xD;
      ml/kg/h. After the start of anesthesia, the infusion speed is adjusted to 5ml/kg/h. The dose&#xD;
      of artificial colloids is less than 20 ml/kg. The infusion volume is adjusted based on the&#xD;
      amount of fluid input and output.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental drugs are infused via the syringe pump approximately 1 hour before the end of&#xD;
      surgery, i.e., at the end of dural suturing, at a speed of 2 ml/min, i.e., 120 ml/h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for extubation: a. recovery of spontaneous breathing; b. over 95% SpO2; c. patients&#xD;
      can complete the instructions (eye opening to voice).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for discharge from the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU): a. 1&lt;= RASS score&gt; = -2; b.&#xD;
      in the case of oxygen inhalation via a nasal catheter at a flow rate of 3-5 L/min, SpO2 can&#xD;
      maintain above 95%; c. the observation time after extubation is &gt; = 30 minutes.&#xD;

      Adverse Events:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the adverse events occur after drug administration, which may be unrelated to drug&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observation and recording of adverse effects Careful inquiry and tracing is necessary for all&#xD;
      the adverse events during the experiment, including laboratory abnormalities. All adverse&#xD;
      events must be judged by their nature, severity and correlation with drug treatment, which&#xD;
      should be strictly recorded in the case report form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlation assessment Correlations between adverse events and experimental medication are as&#xD;
      follows: definitely related, probably related, possibly related, possibly unrelated,&#xD;
      certainly unrelated. The incidence of adverse reactions is calculated based on three&#xD;
      conditions described as definitely related, probably related, and possibly related. Specific&#xD;
      criteria are seen in Appendix 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severity assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severity of adverse events is divided into three levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mild: Treatment is usually not necessary for a transient increase in blood pressure and&#xD;
      decrease in HR, because the subject is under anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moderate: The bolus injection of atropine 0.3-1 mg is given for sinus bradycardia and escape&#xD;
      rhythm. If combination with hypotension, the bolus injection of ephedrine 10-15 mg can be&#xD;
      applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe: For sinus standstill, cardiopulmonary resuscitation is applied if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment for adverse events during and after the experiment Outcomes of all adverse events&#xD;
      should be followed and recorded. The subject who withdraws from the experiment due to adverse&#xD;
      events should be traced till the adverse events completed removed. Researchers must determine&#xD;
      whether an adverse event is related to experimental drugs, and provide a basis to support&#xD;
      this judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious adverse events Definition: Adverse events occur during clinical trials that result in&#xD;
      a series of serious consequences, including hospitalization, prolonging hospitalization,&#xD;
      disability, affecting the ability to work, endangering the life or death, and congenital&#xD;
      malformations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reporting of the serious adverse events: Serious adverse reactions should be reported to the&#xD;
      team leader and sponsor within 24 hours, and the serious adverse event table should be&#xD;
      filled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contacts: Yue Yun, +86 13889168717, Second Department of Anesthesiology First Affiliated&#xD;
      Hospital of China Medical University, China Urgent Unblinding Method When serious adverse&#xD;
      reactions appear during the experiment, if necessary, the study director can open the&#xD;
      emergency envelope to carry out urgent unblinding strategy and record the relevant causes and&#xD;
      date in the case report form. Whether the unblinded subjects withdraw from the experiment is&#xD;
      decided by investigators and responsible party.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management and Statistical Analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Description: Completed case report forms are collected by the clinical inspector&#xD;
      and submitted to the responsible party for data processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After confirmation, the data from case report forms are locked into the database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 3 groups when unblinding for the first time. Information description Count data are&#xD;
      described using percentages, and measurement data expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Not&#xD;
      normally distributed data are expressed as median and percentiles (25th-75th percentiles).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of baseline data Intergroup count data are compared using chi-square test or&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test. If measurement data normally distributed exhibit homogeneity of&#xD;
      variance, single-factor or multi-factor analysis of variance is applied. If heterogeneity of&#xD;
      variance is shown, non-parametric test or approximate test (e.g., Tamhnnes T2 test) is&#xD;
      employed. For measurement data not normally distributed, non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test&#xD;
      or Kruskall-Wallis rank sum test is used. Baseline balance and comparability in each group is&#xD;
      examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of Efficacy: Analgesic and sedative effects between groups are compared using&#xD;
      Kruskall-Wallis rank sum test. For markedly effective, pairwise comparison in data&#xD;
      differences between are analyzed using Mann-Whitney U non-parametric test. Considering the&#xD;
      center or other factors, CMH X2 test is employed for comparison of two-classification index&#xD;
      and level indicators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Processing: All statistical data are analyzed using SAS software for data processing.&#xD;
      Two-sided test is employed for statistical analysis, and the corresponding P values are&#xD;
      given. For the Fisher's exact test, P value is calculated directly. A value of P &lt;0.05 is&#xD;
      considered significant, and P &lt;0.01 considered highly significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unblinding for the second time is carried out by the end of statistical analysis, and there&#xD;
      are two experimental groups and one control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality Assurance and Quality Control:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators In this clinical study, there are two responsible parties and five principal&#xD;
      investigators. The clinical scheme is implemented strictly. An inspector is appointed to&#xD;
      monitor the clinical trial at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality Control of the measurement indexes The observation indexes are observed according to&#xD;
      standard operating procedures and quality control procedures. National legal units of&#xD;
      measurements are employed for various test items. The test report form must complete the&#xD;
      Assay report card must have complete items, including the date, test items, test results and&#xD;
      their normal range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical standards The study protocol, case report forms, informed consent should be approved&#xD;
      by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators or investigator-authorized officers will be responsible to explain the benefits&#xD;
      and risks of participating in the clinical trial for each patient, the patient's legal&#xD;
      representative or notary witnesses. The written informed consent should be obtained prior to&#xD;
      study entry (before screening test and drug administration).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients or their legal representatives and personnel chairing the informed consent&#xD;
      process sign their names and date to the informed consent. The original file is saved by the&#xD;
      investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data retention The investigators should be responsible for the intact data intact, have a&#xD;
      fixed place to store the data which are locked for future viewing. In accordance with the&#xD;
      principles of GCP in China, the data should be kept for at least 5 years.&#xD;
