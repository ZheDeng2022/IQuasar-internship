  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is the only vaccine licenced to prevent&#xD;
      tuberculosis (TB). The stimulus it gives to the immune system allows it to respond more&#xD;
      effectively to a subsequent infection with TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have shown that BCG is effective in reducing deaths from TB disease,&#xD;
      particularly in children. However, there is also evidence that in countries with a relatively&#xD;
      high death rate, BCG reduces this death rate but by more than would be expected by its effect&#xD;
      on TB alone. This controversial but important finding warrants further and serious&#xD;
      consideration. One possibility is that BCG, in addition to stimulating the immune system&#xD;
      against TB, also has a positive effect on the way the immune system works more generally.&#xD;
      This might mean a more effective response to serious infections that are completely unrelated&#xD;
      to TB, or the ability to respond better to other routine childhood vaccines, or to maintain&#xD;
      such responses for longer. In these examples, the timing of BCG administration in relation to&#xD;
      other vaccines could be crucial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will recruit 30 healthy babies who would not routinely be offered the BCG vaccine&#xD;
      in the UK within the first week of life. Babies will be assigned at random to one of three&#xD;
      groups of ten babies each. BCG will be given to one group of babies around birth, one at&#xD;
      three months old and the last group will not get BCG during the study. Babies will stay in&#xD;
      the study until 13 months old and have five blood tests over this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This preliminary study will look at the participants' blood to see if there are differences&#xD;
      in the immune system, or its response to the MenC childhood meningitis vaccine or the pattern&#xD;
      of genes activated after BCG has been given.&#xD;
