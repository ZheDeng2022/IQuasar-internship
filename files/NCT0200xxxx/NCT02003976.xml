  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) receiving&#xD;
      optimized non-surgical treatment plus surgical realignment of the tibia, or optimized&#xD;
      non-surgical treatment only. We hypothesize that outcomes assessed at 12 and 24 months&#xD;
      follow-up will suggest favourable changes in patients undergoing surgical realignment when&#xD;
      compared to patients receiving non-surgical treatment only.&#xD;

      This two groups, parallel design randomized controlled trial will compare patients with&#xD;
      medial compartment knee OA and varus alignment receiving optimized non-surgical treatment&#xD;
      plus High Tibial Osteotomy (HTO) to similar patients receiving optimized non-surgical&#xD;
      treatment only. All participants will receive non-surgical treatment that will be&#xD;
      individualized to the patient and include medications, physiotherapy and nutritional&#xD;
      seminars. The non-surgical treatment will include supervised physiotherapy and nutritional&#xD;
      seminars once per week for 12 weeks, will be accompanied and followed by a home program, and&#xD;
      follow-up appointments for potential modification every three months for the duration of the&#xD;
      study. Participants randomized to surgery will also undergo medial opening wedge HTO after 12&#xD;
      weeks of optimized non-surgical treatment. Both groups will follow the same schedule of&#xD;
      clinic visits throughout the 24 month follow-up period. MRI-derived measures of articular&#xD;
      cartilage morphology, biological markers of articular cartilage degradation and synthesis,&#xD;
      gait biomechanics and patient-reported outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 12 and 24&#xD;
      months follow-up.&#xD;

    <description>The optimized non-surgical treatment program consists of medications, physiotherapy and nutritional seminars. The 12-week program will include an assessment by a primary care physician, physiotherapist and orthopaedic surgeon, one supervised physiotherapy session per week, one body recomposition session per week, and a home program. After the 12-week program is completed, patients randomized to this group will undergo a medial opening wedge high tibial osteotomy (HTO). They will continue with their home program and will be followed up for 2 years after baseline.</description>

          2. Does this subject present with varus alignment? (Based on hip to ankle x-rays).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Does this subject have clinical Knee OA? (MAA &lt;-2Â° on full limb standing AP) according&#xD;
             to the Altman classification primarily involving the medial compartment of the knee?&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient is a good candidate for high tibial osteotomy and will be receiving a PEEK&#xD;
             plate, or if receiving an alternate plate, agrees to have the plate removed prior to 1&#xD;
             year postoperative.&#xD;
&#xD;

             is the better surgical option) and/or Kellgren and Lawrence grade 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The subject's disease is not advanced enough (symptomatically or radiographically) to&#xD;
             warrant HTO.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Does this subject have a major medical illness with life expectancy &lt;2 years or with&#xD;
             an unacceptably high operative risk?&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Does this subject have a major neurological deficit that would affect gait?&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Is this subject possibly pregnant or planning pregnancy?&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Is this subject unable to read English?&#xD;
