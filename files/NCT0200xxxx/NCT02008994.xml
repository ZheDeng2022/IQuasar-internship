      Genes are the basic &quot;instruction book&quot; for the cells that make up our bodies and are made out&#xD;
      of DNA. Many research studies are done to find the best possible way to treat patients with&#xD;
      cancer. Recently there has been a great deal of interest in developing new anticancer agents&#xD;
      that are more targeted to a patient's individual genetic information, as well as diseases&#xD;
      caused by defects in a person's genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of precisely which treatments to use against a specific patient's tumor is&#xD;
      challenging. In this study, four cutting-edge technologies will be used to identify genomic&#xD;
      (information we get from DNA and RNA) and proteomic (information we get from proteins)&#xD;
      targets for the treatment of your tumor. These four tests will be used together to gather&#xD;
      information about your tumor giving doctors and scientists a better understanding of the&#xD;
      structure of your tumor and what the best treatment or combination of treatments may be for&#xD;
      you. The therapy you receive to treat your tumor will be based on your medical history,&#xD;
      previous treatments for your disease if applicable, current state of health, and the findings&#xD;
      from these four tests. The therapy you ultimately receive will be selected by your doctor in&#xD;
      consultation with a panel of experts in cancer and cancer genomics (the Treatment Selection&#xD;
      Committee).&#xD;

      DNA contains genetic information that acts as a blueprint for how parts of your body are made&#xD;
      and work, determining such things as eye and hair color. DNA is made up of long strands of&#xD;
      repeating letters that form a code. The order in which these letters are written is very&#xD;
      precise. In the same way that a spelling mistake in a word could change its meaning entirely&#xD;
      (for example, mean and meat), a single change in the sequence of DNA can lead to a change in&#xD;
      how the body works, which may lead to disease. Currently, researchers and doctors know some&#xD;
      of the genetic changes that may result in disease, but they do not know all of the genetic&#xD;
      changes that can cause disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proteins are the basic building blocks of your body. The parts of your body such as your&#xD;
      muscles, your skin, and your organs are made up mostly of proteins. DNA provides the plans,&#xD;
      or instructions, for how each protein should be made. If there is a change in your DNA, there&#xD;
      may be a change in how a protein is made. Sometimes these changes can lead to disease. To&#xD;
      make a protein, the cells in your body take the DNA and make a copy called RNA. The cells&#xD;
      read the RNA to make the protein. DNA can be thought of as the original master plan with RNA&#xD;
      being photocopies of this plan. The number of copies of RNA can determine the amount of&#xD;
      protein that can be made. If the body needs more protein, it can make more RNA but if it&#xD;
      needs less protein, it can also shred the RNA so that it cannot be read. The amount of a&#xD;
      particular RNA or protein can also be important in how the body works. Too much or too little&#xD;
      of a particular protein can also lead to disease. Understanding the relationship between DNA,&#xD;
      RNA and proteins can be important in knowing what causes disease and how to treat it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of precisely which treatments to use against a specific patient's tumor is&#xD;
      challenging. In this study, four cutting-edge technologies will be used to identify genomic&#xD;
      (information we get from DNA and RNA) and proteomic (information we get from proteins)&#xD;
      targets for the treatment of your tumor. These four tests will be used together to gather&#xD;
      information about your tumor giving doctors and scientists a better understanding of the&#xD;
      structure of your tumor and what the best treatment or combination of treatments may be for&#xD;
      you. The therapy you receive to treat your tumor will be based on your medical history,&#xD;
      previous treatments for your disease if applicable, current state of health, and the findings&#xD;
      from these four tests. The therapy you ultimately receive will be selected by your doctor in&#xD;
      consultation with a panel of experts in cancer and cancer genomics (the Treatment Selection&#xD;
      Committee).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of targeted therapy for breast cancer&#xD;
      based upon proteomic and genomic profiling using four different methods of analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reverse Phase Protein Microarray will be used to determine how often there are specific&#xD;
           proteins that could make the tumor susceptible or resistant to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immunohistochemistry will look for specific markers of disease in DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RNA sequencing will be used to help doctors and scientists understand how genes are&#xD;
           working.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Low pass whole genome and exome sequencing will be used to help identify variants in&#xD;
           DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study will be to enroll at least 25 women who will receive therapy&#xD;
      influenced by the results derived from genomic and proteomic profiling. Up to 30 women will&#xD;
      receive treatment suggested by an identified target and up to 10 women will receive treatment&#xD;
      that the subject and her doctor choose. The actual treatment of disease will be based upon&#xD;
      multiple factors, including current physical condition, prior therapies if applicable,&#xD;
      standard labs and tests, and physician's preference. The results from the genomic and&#xD;
      proteomic profiling will add to the available information that will be used to aid us in&#xD;
      deciding upon the course of therapy.&#xD;
