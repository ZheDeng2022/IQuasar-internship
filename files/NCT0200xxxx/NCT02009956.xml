             Eluting CSS) (Arm B)*&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ≥ TIMI 1 coronary flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
             *Subject to commercial availability of product sizes in the specific region/country.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must be an acceptable candidate for coronary artery bypass surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within&#xD;
             seven (7) days before the procedure and must agree to use a reliable method of&#xD;
             contraception from the time of screening through 12 months after the index procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient and the patient's physician agree to the follow-up schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient or guardian who has been informed of the nature of the study agrees to its&#xD;
             provisions and has provided written informed consent, approved by the appropriate&#xD;
             Institutional Review Board/Ethical Committee of the respective clinical site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin,&#xD;

             methacrylate or polylactide polymer, or sensitivity to contrast which cannot be&#xD;
             adequately premedicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is a female, intending to get pregnant within the next year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Target vessel(s) require a staged procedure post index hospitalization discharge&#xD;
             through 9 months of this index procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There will be an untreated significant lesion of &gt; 40% diameter stenosis remaining&#xD;
             proximal or distal to the target site after the planned intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous placement of a stent within 10 mm of the target lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total occlusion or TIMI 0 coronary flow in the target vessel.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Restenosis lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The proximal target vessel or target lesion is severely calcified by visual&#xD;
             assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aorto-ostial location, unprotected left main lesion location, or a lesion within 5 mm&#xD;
             of the origin of the LAD or LCX.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lesion involvement of a significant side branch (branch diameter &gt; 2 mm) that would be&#xD;
             covered by stenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  High probability that treatment other than PTCA or stenting will be required for&#xD;
             treatment of the same lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has suffered a myocardial infarction within the past 72 hours and the CK&#xD;

          -  The patient has renal insufficiency as determined by a creatinine of &gt; 2.0 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The target lesion, or the target vessel proximal to the target lesion, contains&#xD;
             thrombus.&#xD;

          -  Documented left ventricular ejection fraction of ≤ 25%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is a recipient of a heart transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has extensive peripheral vascular disease that precludes safe sheath&#xD;
             insertion or extreme anti-coagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has other medical illness (i.e., cancer or congestive heart failure) that&#xD;
             may cause the patient to be non-compliant with the protocol, confound the data&#xD;
             interpretation or is associated withlimited life expectancy (i.e., less than one&#xD;
             year).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is simultaneously participating in another investigational device or drug&#xD;
             study. Patient must have completed the primary follow-up phase of any previous study.&#xD;
             Trials with extended follow-up phases of now commercially available products are not&#xD;
