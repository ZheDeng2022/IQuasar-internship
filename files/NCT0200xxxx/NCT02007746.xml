  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with sickle cell disease many have a number of systemic complications, including&#xD;
      liver problems. Some of these liver problems lead to liver fibrosis/cirrhosis, secondary to&#xD;
      chronic blood transfusions. The purpose of this study is to investigate FibroScan readings in&#xD;
      patients with sickle cell disease and iron overload secondary to blood transfusions, and to&#xD;
      correlate the FibroScan results with Ferriscan. A comparison with the results of FibroScan to&#xD;
      patients with Sickle cell without known liver disease, who have never been on chronic&#xD;
      transfusions and with normal liver function profiles will also be made.The primary hypothesis&#xD;
      is that the results of FibroScan will correlate with the results of Ferriscan and liver&#xD;
      biopsy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Liver biopsy is the gold standard to examine the liver for iron deposits and histology.&#xD;
      However, liver biopsy is invasive and involves a risk of bleeding and pain. Biopsy may also&#xD;
      miss significant pathology if the small biopsy specimen is taken from an uninvolved part of&#xD;
      the liver. Non-invasive techniques such as MRI are now used to evaluate the liver iron&#xD;
      content. MRI can visualize the whole liver and measure liver iron content. MRI, however, will&#xD;
      not detect liver scarring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver transient elastography (FibroScan) is a non-invasive ultrasound tool for assessing&#xD;
      liver fibrosis or scarring by measuring liver stiffness (LSM). Compared with liver biopsy,&#xD;
      FibroScan provides immediate results and is a painless, short (3 mins), simple procedure to&#xD;
      perform. In some studies FibroScan reports have correlated well with liver biopsy results of&#xD;
      fibrosis and cirrhosis, and with Ferriscan, ferritin and liver function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This purpose of this study is to investigate the role of FibroScan in individuals with sickle&#xD;
      cell anemia and iron overload or who have a diagnosis of liver disease, and to compare&#xD;
      FibroScan readings with magnetic resonance imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also compare the results of the Fibroscan with liver biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also compare the results of FibroScan to patients with Sickle cell without&#xD;
      any known liver disease, who have never been on chronic transfusions (defined as no more than&#xD;
      4 transfusions in lifetime) and who have normal liver function profiles.&#xD;

    <description>Liver transient elastography (FibroScan) uses a probe consisting of an ultrasound transducer located at the end of a vibrating piston. The piston produces a vibration of low amplitude and frequency, which generate a shear wave that passes through the skin and liver tissue. The ultrasound then detects the propagation of the shear wave through the liver (at a depth of 25 - 65 mm below the skin surface) by measuring its velocity. The shear wave velocity is directly related to the tissue stiffness, with a higher velocity equating to higher tissue stiffness, corresponding to increasing severity of fibrosis.</description>

    <description>Patients will have blood tests done to evaluate liver function and general health, then have FibroScan and Ferriscan. A blinded (no access to laboratory parameters or available data) radiologist will interpret the Ferriscan. Liver biopsy will be also obtained (if not done within the previous year). Otherwise, the results of the recent liver biopsy will be collected.</description>
