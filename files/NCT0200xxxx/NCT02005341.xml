        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Is at least 21 years of age and skeletally mature.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Must have cervical disc disease (defined as neck pain of discogenic origin with&#xD;
             degeneration of the disc confirmed by history and radiographic studies) at one level&#xD;
             in the cervical spine between C3 to T1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Must have completed a minimum of six weeks of unsuccessful conservative, non-operative&#xD;
             care or has the presence of progressive symptoms or signs of nerve root/spinal cord&#xD;
             compression in the face of conservative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has pre-operative objective evidence of primary diagnosis confirmed by appropriate&#xD;
             imaging studies (Anteroposterior/Lateral/Flexion/Extension X-rays &amp; a recent MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Is willing and able to comply with all clinical investigation visits and procedures&#xD;
             including screening treatment procedures, post-operative management, the follow-up&#xD;
             schedule and completion of forms or questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Is able to understand and sign the patient information sheet/informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Requires fusion at more than one level.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Has had prior fusion at the level to be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Has a metabolic or systemic bone disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has a disease that significantly inhibits bone healing (i.e., severe osteoporosis,&#xD;
             osteomalacia, Paget's disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has a systemic or local infection (active or latent).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Has acute or chronic infections in the surgical area (i.e., soft tissue infections;&#xD;
             inflammatory, bacterial bone disorders, osteomyelitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Chronic use of steroids, other than episodic use or inhaled corticosteroids.&#xD;

             uncontrolled diabetes Type I, dialysis dependent renal failure, symptomatic liver&#xD;
             disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Has a mental or physical condition that would limit the ability to comply with study&#xD;
             requirements or would preclude accurate evaluation.&#xD;
