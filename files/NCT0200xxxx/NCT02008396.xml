    <textblock>
      This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled exploratory pilot study assessed the safety&#xD;
      and feasibility of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted therapy for social&#xD;
      anxiety in MDMA-naïve adults on the autism spectrum. Each of the 12 subjects participated in&#xD;
      two blinded experimental sessions, assisted by either MDMA (75 mg to 125 mg) or placebo,&#xD;
      which lasted seven hours. Before experimental sessions, participants underwent three separate&#xD;
      hour-long preparatory sessions to learn what to expect and complete pre-treatment&#xD;
      assignments. After each experimental session, participants underwent three separate hour-long&#xD;
      integrative sessions to help integrate their experiences and insights from the experimental&#xD;
      sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects assigned to the MDMA group received two of three different doses, either 75 mg, 100&#xD;
      mg, or 125 mg MDMA. Overall, eight subjects were randomized to the MDMA group and four&#xD;
      subjects were randomized to the placebo group. Observations before, during, and after&#xD;
      experimental sessions were compared between these groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study was to collect safety data to examine whether MDMA-assisted&#xD;
      therapy was tolerated and to estimate symptom reduction in social anxiety and other&#xD;
      psychiatric symptoms. The primary outcome measure was change in social anxiety symptoms as&#xD;
      measured by the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) [Heimberg et al., 1999].&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies suggest that autistic adults are at greater risk for social anxiety. Social anxiety&#xD;
      is a condition characterized by fear of scrutiny and avoidance of social interactions. Social&#xD;
      anxiety frequently compounds the considerable social challenges experienced by autistic&#xD;
      adults. There are currently no FDA-approved pharmacologic treatments for autistic adults,&#xD;
      although off-label prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are on the&#xD;
      rise in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the known effects of MDMA, as well as individual reports from autistic adults, this&#xD;
      exploratory study focused on enhancing functional skills in this underserved population, who&#xD;
      tend to experience greater anxiety, depression and victimization than typically developing&#xD;
      adults. This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled exploratory pilot study assessed&#xD;
      the safety and feasibility of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted therapy for&#xD;
      social anxiety in MDMA-naïve adults on the autism spectrum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study was to collect safety data to examine whether MDMA-assisted&#xD;
      therapy was tolerated and to estimate symptom reduction in social anxiety and other&#xD;
      psychiatric symptoms that are common in the adult autistic population as evaluated by&#xD;
      standard clinical measures. The primary outcome measure was change in social anxiety symptoms&#xD;
      as measured by the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) [Heimberg et al., 1999].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of the 12 subjects participated in two blinded experimental sessions, assisted by either&#xD;
      MDMA or placebo, which lasted seven hours. Before experimental sessions, participants&#xD;
      underwent three separate hour-long preparatory sessions to learn what to expect and complete&#xD;
      pre-treatment assignments. After each experimental session, participants underwent three&#xD;
      separate hour-long integrative sessions to help integrate their experiences and insights from&#xD;
      the experimental sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was designed as a dose escalation study to assist with the exploration of safety&#xD;
      and finding the most effective dose in this population. Upon enrollment, the first six&#xD;
      subjects (Group 1) was randomized to receive one dose of either placebo (N=2) or 75 mg of&#xD;
      MDMA (N=4). In the second experimental session one month later, Group 1 subjects randomized&#xD;
      to MDMA escalated to 100 mg of MDMA, unless contraindicated. The second six subjects enrolled&#xD;
      (Group 2) were randomized to receive one dose of either placebo (N=2) or 100 mg of MDMA&#xD;
      (N=4). In the second experimental session one month later, Group 2 subjects randomized to&#xD;
      MDMA escalated to 125 mg of MDMA, unless contraindicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blind was maintained through the six-month follow-up. In Stage 2 after the blind was&#xD;
      broken, subjects who received placebo in Stage 1 were offered an open-label extension with&#xD;
      two experimental sessions of MDMA scheduled one month apart. Subjects received 75 mg of MDMA&#xD;
      in the first session and escalated to 125 mg of MDMA in the second session, unless&#xD;
      contraindicated.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The LSAS is a 24-item, semi-structured interview on the severity of Social Anxiety Disorder. The LSAS separately assesses fear and avoidance of 24 social situations. The scale is divided into 2 subscales, 13 situations concerning performance anxiety, and 11 situations pertaining to social situations. The 24 items are first rated on a Likert Scale from 0 to 3 on fear felt during the situations, and then the same items are rated regarding avoidance of the situation. Combining the total scores for the Fear and Avoidance sections provides an overall score with a maximum of 144 points and a minimum of 0 points. The higher the score, the greater the anxiety symptoms. The overall scores are interpreted as: 55-65 is moderate, 65-80 is marked, 80-95 is severe, and greater than 95 is very severe social anxiety symptoms.</description>

        <title>Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) Total Score at Baseline</title>
        <description>The LSAS is a 24-item, semi-structured interview on the severity of Social Anxiety Disorder. The LSAS separately assesses fear and avoidance of 24 social situations. The scale is divided into 2 subscales, 13 situations concerning performance anxiety, and 11 situations pertaining to social situations. The 24 items are first rated on a Likert Scale from 0 to 3 on fear felt during the situations, and then the same items are rated regarding avoidance of the situation. Combining the total scores for the Fear and Avoidance sections provides an overall score with a maximum of 144 points and a minimum of 0 points. The higher the score, the greater the anxiety symptoms. The overall scores are interpreted as: 55-65 is moderate, 65-80 is marked, 80-95 is severe, and greater than 95 is very severe social anxiety symptoms.</description>
