  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      US children's active commuting to school (ACS; walking or cycling to school), previously&#xD;
      common (48% in 1969) is now uncommon (13% in 2009). This decline coincided with the obesity&#xD;
      epidemic, which disproportionately affects low-income and ethnic minority children. Programs&#xD;
      to increase children's moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and lower obesity and&#xD;
      related chronic disease risk are necessary. The Bicycle Train is an innovative program in&#xD;
      which children cycle to and from school led by adults. Bicycle Trains provide another option&#xD;
      for ACS, especially for children who live too far to walk to school. No randomized controlled&#xD;
      trials (RCT) have evaluated Bicycle Trains and children's ACS or MVPA. Increasing the percent&#xD;
      of children who cycle to school is sub-objective PA-14 of US Healthy People 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary Goals are to (a) conduct a pilot cluster RCT of a Bicycle Train program among&#xD;
      low-income, ethnic minority 4th and 5th grade children and (b) collect concurrent&#xD;
      accelerometer and GPS data and validate algorithms to identify and measure physical activity&#xD;
      intensity and duration for children's cycling compared to heart rate monitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our Specific Aims will be to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA1) evaluate among 80 4th and 5th grade ethnic minority children the feasibility of a pilot&#xD;
      cluster RCT of a Bicycle Train program for (a) recruiting participants for a planned&#xD;
      full-scale cluster RCT (b) promoting their participation, and (c) identifying&#xD;
      barriers/facilitators to their participation; and SA2) validate algorithms examining&#xD;
      concurrent accelerometry and global positioning system (GPS) data to identify and measure&#xD;
      children's physical activity intensity and duration while cycling compared to the criterion&#xD;
      standards of heart rate monitoring and direct observation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility Criteria (FC): As recommended for pilot studies, in which the main goal is to&#xD;
      test feasibility of a research protocol, a fully powered R01-funded cluster RCT will be&#xD;
      determined to be feasible if:&#xD;
&#xD;
      FC 1) We successfully recruit 80 low-income 4th and 5th grade children for the pilot Bicycle&#xD;
      Train cluster RCT FC 2) The intervention children participate in the Bicycle Train program on&#xD;
      average twice/week or more FC 3) Algorithms analyzing concurrent GPS and accelerometer data&#xD;
      have high agreement, i.e. &gt;90% agreement, with heart rate data/direct observation in&#xD;
      distinguishing children's cycling-related physical activity duration and intensity from other&#xD;
      physical activities and riding in a motor vehicle&#xD;

      Physical activity decreases the risk of cardiovascular disease, Type 2 Diabetes, and multiple&#xD;
      cancers, and is important for obesity prevention. US children's active commuting to school&#xD;
      (ACS; walking or cycling to school), previously common (48% in 1969) is now uncommon (13% in&#xD;
      2009). This decline coincided with the obesity epidemic, which disproportionately affects&#xD;
      low-income and ethnic minority children. Programs to increase children's moderate-to-vigorous&#xD;

      provide another option for ACS, especially for children who live too far to walk to school.&#xD;

      accelerometer and GPS data and validate algorithms to identify and measure physical activity&#xD;
      intensity and duration for children's cycling compared to heart rate monitors. This pilot&#xD;
      study will provide feasibility data and extend the validity of quantifying cycling-related&#xD;
      MVPA for a future fully-powered R01-funded Bicycle Train cluster RCT.&#xD;

      physical activities and riding in a motor vehicle&#xD;
&#xD;
      This R21 application will provide important planning and methods validation targeted towards&#xD;
      ethnic-minority children, the population at highest risk for childhood obesity in the US.&#xD;
