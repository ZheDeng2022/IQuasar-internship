  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past years, endovascular interventions have become an important part of treatment in&#xD;
      patients with peripheral arterial disease.1 Indication for endovascular repair of&#xD;
      femoropopliteal lesions has been considerably enlarged as shown in the TASC classification.1&#xD;
      Enlargement of endovascular therapy indication was based on patient choice for a less&#xD;
      invasive technique and evidence based medicine. Consequently, TASC classification of lesions&#xD;
      has been modified to reflect increased evidence for endovascular treatment of more extensive&#xD;
      femoropopliteal lesions, and indication for endovascular repair has been enlarged to more&#xD;
      severe TASC types. In summary, endovascular treatment is indicated for TASC A and B lesions&#xD;
      which correspond to femoropopliteal lesions ≤15-cm. To treat these lesions, the&#xD;
      interventionalists have at their disposal a huge tool box. Evaluation of these tools is&#xD;
      crucial to determine the right treatment strategy to avoid further reinterventions and&#xD;
      overcosts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the BATTLE trial is to compare a bare metal self expandable nitinol stent&#xD;
      (Misago RX) versus a paclitaxel eluting stent (Zilver PTX) in the treatment of above-the-knee&#xD;
      intermediate length femoropopliteal lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From hospitals in Europe (France, Switzerland) we will randomly assign patients with&#xD;
      symptomatic atherosclerotic femoropopliteal lesions to be treated either by bare metal stent&#xD;
      or paclitaxel eluting stent. In total, 186 patients will be randomized (93 per group).&#xD;
