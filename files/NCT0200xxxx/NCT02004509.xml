      Introduction: Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) have a substantial risk of stroke and&#xD;
      systemic embolism. Subclinical AF is often suspected to be the cause of stroke in these&#xD;
      patients. The detection of asymptomatic AF episodes is a challenge and the real rate of&#xD;
      occurrence of these episodes remains unknown. The rate of stroke is high among patients who&#xD;
      have received a pacemaker and this device can detect subclinical episodes of rapid atrial&#xD;
      rate, which correlate with electrocardiographically documented AF. The net benefit of&#xD;
      anticoagulant treatment is well established in patients with clinical AF but data about&#xD;
      anticoagulation in subclinical AF setting is unknown. The aim of this study is to assess the&#xD;
      impact of anticoagulant therapy on subclinical AF, directed by cardiac implantable electronic&#xD;
      device (CIED) intensive monitoring, on the incidence of stroke and systemic embolism and&#xD;
      correlate the AF episodes detected by CIED with thromboembolic events. Methods: This is a&#xD;
      prospective, randomized, unicentric, parallel clinical study in patients with&#xD;
      atrioventricular pacemaker, defibrillator, or cardiac resynchronization therapy devices in&#xD;
      sinus rhythm and CHADS2 score (an index of the risk of stroke in patients with atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation, range from 0 to 6) ≥ 2 . Patients will be randomized to the intervention group&#xD;
      - intensive monitoring arm (Group I) or control group - routine schedule arm (Group II) in a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio. Time to inclusion will be 24 months and all patients will be followed up for a&#xD;
      period of 36 months. Group I, patients will be submitted to device data collection every 2&#xD;
      months, while in Group II, patients will be managed conventionally. Patients from Group I&#xD;
      with episodes of subclinical AF will receive anticoagulant therapy, as well as patients with&#xD;
      clinical AF of both arms. Device data from Group II patients will not be analyzed until they&#xD;
      achieve the primary endpoint. Primary endpoint: stroke or systemic embolism. Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints: subclinical AF rate, total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, cardiovascular hospitalization, and bleeding rates. Expected outcome: It is&#xD;
      expected that anticoagulation therapy of subclinical AF directed by CIED intensive monitoring&#xD;
      will reduce the incidence of stroke and systemic embolism comparing to patients with&#xD;
      non-diagnosed subclinical AF.&#xD;
