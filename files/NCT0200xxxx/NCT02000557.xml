    <textblock>
      The present day social setup considers facial charisma as an important physical&#xD;
      characteristic. The facial characteristics of an individual are measured through&#xD;
      anthropometry, photogrammetry, computer imaging and cephalometric radiographs. Cephalometric&#xD;
      radiographs offer significant diagnostic information regarding the association between the&#xD;
      dental and skeletal structures. By means of photogrammetric measurements, a fresh diagnostic&#xD;
      resource is accessible to the orthodontist which permits an intangible, radiation free&#xD;
      attainment of measure points of soft tissue with no instrumental expense and radiation to the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orthodontic patients range from adolescents to senior citizens and originate from an&#xD;
      assortment of populations, thus an extensive series of representative norms will be ideal.&#xD;
      Knowledge of the normal dentofacial outline of every group will make certain better success&#xD;
      of treatment to set up the best possible facial agreement. Hence, it is extremely important&#xD;
      to assess the soft tissue profile of a patient as it is one of the most vital components of&#xD;
      orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the photographic characteristics of soft&#xD;
      tissue facial profile of patients with class II malocclusion as ethnic differences have been&#xD;
      found to be reported in the literature. It is hypothesized that soft tissue facial&#xD;
      characteristics on lateral profile photographs and lateral cephalometric radiographs in a&#xD;
      sample of local population with class II malocclusion are closely related.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The goal of orthodontic treatment planning is to achieve facial synchronization by an&#xD;
      esthetically pleasing face.It was a common idea in orthodontic treatment planning that soft&#xD;
      tissue enhancement would follow the hard tissues, but this did not always happen.The reaction&#xD;
      of soft tissue to hard tissue movement is not found to be consistent.With the emergence of a&#xD;
      new paradigm in orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning, greater emphasis has been&#xD;
      placed on the relationships of soft tissues and lesser emphasis on the treatment of&#xD;
      malocclusion. During the last few years, diagnosis and treatment planning in orthodontics has&#xD;
      been reallocated in the direction of facial planning. Formerly, a lot of consideration was&#xD;
      placed on the dental and skeletal components but now greater thought is paid to the soft&#xD;
      tissue components. The purpose of treatment in the new paradigm is to place the teeth in&#xD;
      optimal position with reference to the lips, both vertically as well as antero-posteriorly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The facial characteristics of an individual are measured through anthropometry,&#xD;
      photogrammetry, computer imaging and cephalometric radiographs. Cephalometric radiographs&#xD;
      offer significant diagnostic information regarding the association between the dental and&#xD;
      skeletal structures. Lateral cephalogram has been reported in the literature as an essential&#xD;
      element of the diagnostic procedure in orthodontics. Frontal and lateral photographs of the&#xD;
      patient correspond to another frequently used diagnostic method. Linear and angular soft&#xD;
      tissue facial profile analysis on photographs is carried out corresponding to radiographic&#xD;
      cephalometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While taking a lateral cephalometric radiograph, the patient is exposed to radiations,&#xD;
      moreover; the bony structures overlap each other that enhances the likelihood of misreading&#xD;
      of the measured values. By means of photogrammetric measurements, a fresh diagnostic resource&#xD;
      is accessible to the orthodontist which permits an intangible, radiation free attainment of&#xD;
      measure points of soft tissue with no instrumental expense and radiation to the patient. It&#xD;
      has also been reported that lip-tooth relationships during speech and while smiling are not&#xD;
      documented by means of the cephalometric radiograph. Photographs of the face while smiling&#xD;
      and at rest are essential to acquire lip-tooth relationships. By means of this, the&#xD;
      orthodontist can evaluate anterior tooth as well as adjoining soft tissue relationships. Even&#xD;
      though cephalometry is the standard for illustrating skeletal and dental morphology but it&#xD;
      might not be appropriate for extensive epidemiologic studies because of the radiations that&#xD;
      the patient is exposed to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Edward Angle, the father of modern orthodontics classified malocclusion based on the position&#xD;
      of the maxillary first molar into three types; class I or neutrocclusion, class II or&#xD;
      distocclusion and class III or mesiocclusion. Class II malocclusions are contemplated to be&#xD;
      one of the most common among all the other forms of malocclusions. It has been reported in&#xD;
      the literature that class II malocclusions present an assortment of dental and skeletal&#xD;
      configurations. Skeletal class II patterns occur not merely from sagittal discrepancies but&#xD;
      as well from vertical discrepancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dental class II is associated with distal relationship of lower teeth with their upper&#xD;
      counterparts. It further has two subdivisions, class II division 1 and class II division 2.&#xD;
      Class II division 2 malocclusion is less commonly come across as compared to class II&#xD;
      division 1. The etiology behind class II malocclusion is multifactorial. An important&#xD;
      etiological agent in this type of malocclusion is the soft tissue. For instance, class II&#xD;
      division I malocclusion is commonly due to the result of a short or hypotonic upper lip while&#xD;
      class II division II is due to the result of bimaxillary retroclination caused by active&#xD;
      muscular lips. Prevalence of different occlusions vary with populations of diverse origin and&#xD;
      comparable is the case with class II malocclusion. It has been reported in the international&#xD;
      literature that class II malocclusion is the most prevalent form of malocclusion as compared&#xD;
      to class I and class III malocclusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the photographic characteristics of soft&#xD;
      tissue facial profile of patients with class II malocclusion. The current study has also been&#xD;
      planned to observe and compare the results of photographic and cephalometric variables. Soft&#xD;
      tissue profile analysis of class II patients would assist us in planning the orthodontic&#xD;
      treatment in such individuals. This would serve the purpose of establishing the diagnostic&#xD;
      values that would aid the orthodontists in future while planning the treatment plan for class&#xD;
      II patients. Planning soft tissue analysis on photographs would also save the patient from&#xD;
      excessive radiographic exposure and would help in better planning of the soft tissues.&#xD;
