  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diarrhea is the second leading cause of death in children worldwide, and accurately assessing&#xD;
      dehydration status remains a crucial step in preventing morbidity and mortality from this&#xD;
      disease. While children with severe dehydration require immediate treatment with intravenous&#xD;
      fluids, children with mild to moderate dehydration have a significant reduction in hospital&#xD;
      length of stay and fewer adverse events when treated with relatively inexpensive oral&#xD;
      rehydration solution (ORS). While several clinical scales have been developed for assessing&#xD;
      dehydration in children, these scales have never been prospectively validated in a low-income&#xD;
      country setting, where the vast majority of diarrhea morbidity and mortality occurs in&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that new clinical and ultrasound-based tools will improve the&#xD;
      diagnosis of severe dehydration in children with diarrhea in low-income countries, reducing&#xD;
      the morbidity and mortality that occurs as a result of under-diagnosis of severe dehydration&#xD;
      as well as the adverse events and inappropriate utilization of scarce resources that occurs&#xD;
      as a result of over-diagnosis of severe dehydration.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children under five experience 1.7 billion episodes of diarrhea each year, resulting in 36&#xD;
      million cases of severe disease and 700,000 deaths, or 10% of all child deaths worldwide. As&#xD;
      the severity of diarrheal disease can vary quite widely in children, accurately assessing&#xD;
      dehydration status remains a crucial step in preventing morbidity and mortality. While&#xD;
      children with severe dehydration require immediate treatment with intravenous fluids to&#xD;
      prevent hemodynamic compromise, organ ischemia, and death, children with mild to moderate&#xD;
      dehydration have a significant reduction in hospital length of stay and fewer adverse events&#xD;
      when treated with relatively inexpensive oral rehydration solution (ORS). The World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the European&#xD;
      Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) recommend&#xD;
      separating children with acute diarrhea into three groups to determine management based on&#xD;
      the presence or absence of various clinical signs: no dehydration (&lt;3%), some dehydration&#xD;
      (3-9%), and severe dehydration (&gt;9%). These authorities recommend treating children with some&#xD;
      dehydration with ORS and limiting IV hydration to children with severe dehydration, in order&#xD;
      to prevent the inappropriate utilization of scarce hospital resources and the adverse events&#xD;
      associated with a more liberal use of IV hydration in children. However, no clinical&#xD;
      prediction model for severe dehydration has ever been empirically derived and validated in a&#xD;
      developing world setting, where the vast majority of diarrheal deaths occur in children each&#xD;
      year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of this study, the investigators will derive a new clinical prediction rule for&#xD;
      severe dehydration in children with diarrhea in the developing world. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators will validate and assess the reliability of ultrasound of the inferior vena&#xD;
      cava (IVC) for predicting severe dehydration in children with diarrhea. Finally, the&#xD;
      investigators will compare the accuracy of each of these new diagnostic tools to that of the&#xD;
      WHO scale, the current standard for assessing dehydration in most low-income countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will enroll a prospective cohort of children under five admitted with&#xD;
      diarrhea and dehydration to the Dhaka Hospital of the International Center for Diarrheal&#xD;
      Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B). Research staff will identify eligible children on&#xD;
      arrival and obtain informed consent from their guardian. Children will be weighed on arrival&#xD;
      and assessed clinically for the presence or absence of signs of dehydration. A brief&#xD;
      ultrasound of the IVC will also be performed. Children will then be rehydrated according to&#xD;
      standard hospital protocols, with their weight checked regularly until they achieve a stable,&#xD;
      post-hydration weight. Greater than 9% difference between admission weight and stable weight&#xD;
      (or post-illness weight) will be considered the gold standard for severe dehydration, against&#xD;
      which the investigators will determine the accuracy of our new clinical and ultrasound-based&#xD;
      assessment tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Protection of Human Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children enrolled are very unlikely to be exposed to any additional risks or discomforts,&#xD;
      either mental or physical, as a result of participating in this study. Study procedures will&#xD;
      include physical exam and ultrasound, neither of which will expose children to increased&#xD;
      harm, and study procedures will not delay any immediately necessary care, such as IV fluids.&#xD;
      All data collected will be kept strictly confidential in a password-protected database. In&#xD;
      addition to obtaining ethical approval from the Lifespan Institutional Review Board (IRB),&#xD;
      the investigators have also already obtained approval from the ICDDR,B Ethical Review&#xD;
      Committee.&#xD;

    <description>We will follow all enrolled children for up to a maximum of 2 weeks to assess the percent change between initial dehydrated weight and stable rehydration weight or post-illness weight. Greater than 9% weight change or death prior to achieving stable weight will be our criterion standard for severe disease.
