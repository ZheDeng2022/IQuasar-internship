  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research activities funded through PAR &quot;Dissemination and Implementation Research in&#xD;
      Health&quot; in grant R21NR011112 &quot;Legacy Intervention Family Enactment (LIFE)&quot; have been varied&#xD;
      and highly successful. The LIFE project was designed with three primary objectives. Aim 1 was&#xD;
      to assess the efficacy of LIFE as delivered by Retired Senior Volunteers (RSVs) on palliative&#xD;
      care patients': (a) mood and emotional experience; (b) physical symptom burden; and (c)&#xD;
      experience of meaning. Aim 2 was to assess the efficacy of LIFE as delivered by RSVs on one&#xD;
      primary family caregiver's: (a) caregiving stress; (b) mood and emotional experience; and (c)&#xD;
      experience of positive aspects of caregiving. Aim 3 was to assess the ability of RSVs to&#xD;
      deliver LIFE effectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although hospice and palliative care social workers frequently use reminiscence and creative&#xD;
      activities with their patients 16, such interventions need to be more accessible to patients&#xD;
      and families transitioning from community, hospital, and palliative care settings. If hospice&#xD;
      or palliative care is not chosen as a treatment option, few means of delivering therapeutic&#xD;
      reminiscence-based interventions exist. This represents a significant gap in practice and in&#xD;
      the psychosocial palliative care intervention literature. Kazdin and Blase (2011) argue&#xD;
      cogently that the community need for mental health services far outstrips the number of&#xD;
      providers available to assist those in distress. They call strongly for new intervention&#xD;
      delivery modes targeting prevention and treatment to alleviate suffering. Hence, the purpose&#xD;
      of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of retired senior volunteers (RSVs),&#xD;
      who are available nationally through the National Senior Corp Program, to deliver a&#xD;
      three-session reminiscence and creative activity intervention previously found effective in&#xD;
      improving palliative care patient and caregiver outcomes (Allen, 2009; Allen, Hilgeman, Ege,&#xD;
      Shuster, &amp; Burgio, 2008). We hypothesized that palliative care patients and their caregivers&#xD;
      in the RSV-delivered intervention group would demonstrate improved emotional and spiritual&#xD;
      functioning relative to a supportive contact control group. If successful, this mode of&#xD;
      treatment delivery (e.g., RSV intervention) would represent a significant step toward&#xD;
      translation and greater access at earlier disease stages of therapeutic psychosocial&#xD;
      interventions for individuals near the end of life and their family members.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data were collected between June 2009 and December 2011 with approval from The University of&#xD;
      Alabama and the University of Alabama at Birmingham Institutional Review Boards. A variety of&#xD;
      methods were used for palliative care patient/caregiver dyad recruitment via&#xD;
      physicians/clinical champions at two university medical centers, one home health agency, five&#xD;
      assisted living facilities, four congregate apartment sites for older adults and those with&#xD;
      low income, one continuing care retirement community, and one rehabilitation unit in a local&#xD;
      skilled nursing facility. Sixty-six percent of dyads were physician-referred. A community&#xD;
      recruiter and advertisements in community and university print news media were also used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient/Caregiver Screening and Group Assignment After clinical champions at recruitment&#xD;
      sites explained the main components of the project, patients provided verbal consent to have&#xD;
      their contact information forwarded to research staff. Next, research staff contacted&#xD;
      patients who had expressed interest by phone, described the project in more detail, and,&#xD;
      after getting verbal consent, administered the screening measures (basic demographics, the&#xD;
      Vulnerable Elders Survey-13(VES), Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status-modified [TICS-m])&#xD;
      over the telephone. Eligible patients directly nominated a &quot;family&quot; caregiver (related by&#xD;
      blood or marriage or fictive kin) for study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Palliative care patients were eligible if they: (1) were age 55 or older; (2) were living in&#xD;
      the community or assisted living; (3) had an advanced illness or combination of chronic&#xD;
      illnesses; (4) received a score of three or greater on the VES; (5) had no more than mild&#xD;
      cognitive impairment as measured by a score of 17 or greater on the TICS-m; (6) received an&#xD;
      average of four hours per week of care from a caregiver; and (7) read and spoke English.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caregivers were eligible if they: (1) were identified by an eligible palliative care patient;&#xD;
      (2) were over age of 19 (Alabama's age of majority); (3) were providing an average of four&#xD;
      hours per week of care for the patient; (4) were cognitively intact as measured by a score of&#xD;
      28 or greater on the TICS-m; (5) lived nearby; and (6) read and spoke English.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dyads were excluded if the patient was receiving hospice care or if either individual had&#xD;
      schizophrenia or bipolar disorder or had a nursing home admission planned within three&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retired Senior Volunteers RSVs. RSVs were participants in the national Senior Corp program,&#xD;
      part of the Corporation for National and Community Service. They were recruited from (blinded&#xD;
      for review) and (blinded for review). The RSV program is open to all U.S. citizens,&#xD;
      nationals, or lawful permanent resident aliens aged 55 or older&#xD;
      (http://www.nationalservice.gov/programs/senior-corps/rsvp). Within this program, volunteers&#xD;
      receive standard pre-service orientation and training, supplemental insurance while on duty,&#xD;
      and, potentially, reimbursement for costs such as travel incurred during service. RSVs&#xD;
      receive no pay for the services they perform. In this study, RSVs were included if they: (1)&#xD;
      had a high school education; (2) read and spoke English; and (3) had a car and drove&#xD;
      independently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures This RCT compared the RSV-delivered intervention to a supportive telephone contact&#xD;
      control delivered by research staff. Prior experience in dealing with terminal illness was&#xD;
      not an eligibility criterion for RSVs or for research staff. However, RSVs indicated if there&#xD;
      were any type of advanced chronic illness they would prefer to avoid when being assigned a&#xD;
      patient-caregiver dyad. Whereas RSVs were over age 55 and had at least a high school&#xD;
      education, all research staff members were under 40 and had completed at least a bachelor's&#xD;
      degree in social/behavioral science or nursing. Our objective in this RCT was to determine&#xD;
      whether RSVs could be trained to effectively deliver the reminiscence and creative activity&#xD;
      intervention. Thus, the RSVs and research staff did not need to be similar. In translation to&#xD;
      the community, there will only be dyads receiving the intervention from RSVs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient and caregiver written informed consent was obtained at baseline. After baseline,&#xD;
      dyads were stratified by race and site and randomly assigned to the intervention or control&#xD;
      condition. RSVs were asked to audio record the final intervention session for evaluation of&#xD;
      treatment acceptability by palliative care patients and caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline and post-intervention assessments were completed in separate, concurrent interviews&#xD;
      with research staff not involved in providing control calls. Post-intervention assessments&#xD;
      occurred approximately one week after completion of intervention or control contacts, 15 to&#xD;
      20 weeks post-baseline. Qualitative content analysis was used to examine treatment&#xD;
      acceptability. Follow-up assessments for both groups were completed 13 to 14 weeks after the&#xD;
      post-intervention assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RSV-delivered LIFE Intervention Group.Prior to delivering the manualized intervention, RSVs&#xD;
      received intensive training (approximately four to six hours over two sessions), that&#xD;
      included reading materials, structured role-play, and practice opportunities observed by a&#xD;
      licensed clinical psychologist (blinded for review). Research staff were on call for&#xD;
      consultation with RSVs. The LIFE Volunteer Interventionist Manual and LIFE Participant&#xD;
      Notebook have Flesch-Kincaid Grade Levels = 7.0 with a Flesch Reading Ease rating of 68.7%&#xD;
      and were available in 14-point font. The manual and accompanying workbook consist of: (1)&#xD;
      instructions about using the steps of problem solving (D'Zurilla &amp; Nezu, 2007) to decide on a&#xD;
      period of life and creative activity project; (2) constructing a project; (3) evaluation of&#xD;
      the activity; and (4) an appendix with life review questions for dyads that find generation&#xD;
      of stories more difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the help of the RSV, patient-caregiver dyads in session one narrow the focus to a time&#xD;
      period in the patients' life that could be adequately represented in one tangible project&#xD;
      (e.g., scrapbook, cookbook, audiotapes) to represent the patient's values and achievements in&#xD;
      life. The RSV and dyad actively brainstormed ways to portray the life story; then the RSV&#xD;
      helped the dyad narrow the focus to one meaningful project, directing the dyad to the LIFE&#xD;
      Participant Notebook for tips in project construction. The dyad was asked to gather all&#xD;
      necessary materials (such as pictures, recipes, stories from other family members) and&#xD;
      actively work on completing a portion of the project between each session with the RSV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the second session, RSVs helped the dyad work on the activity and further use problem&#xD;
      solving skills. During the third visit, the patient and caregiver shared their activity with&#xD;
      the RSV, who discussed the dyad's feelings about the process, including a qualitative&#xD;
      evaluation of the LIFE project and what the family learned when creating it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RSVs were carefully trained to monitor dyads' reactions. If either member of the dyad reacted&#xD;
      in a persistently negative manner to the intervention, the activity was discontinued. RSVs&#xD;
      were taught to look for depression in the following ways: look for a saddened face, crying,&#xD;
      shaky voice, statement from the caregiver that the care recipient seems depressed (e.g.,&#xD;
      downtrodden, sad, blue). The LIFE Volunteer Interventionist Manual includes &quot;Feelings Checks&quot;&#xD;
      in which the RSVs ask, &quot;How does talking about these memories make you feel?&quot; The average&#xD;
      treatment fidelity score achieved by RSVs during training was 89.8%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient-caregiver dyads received $25 to offset the costs of purchasing materials (e.g., photo&#xD;
      albums, scrapbooks, photograph printing paper, etc.) desired for the project. Research team&#xD;
      members purchased and delivered materials to mobility restricted dyads.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supportive Telephone Contact Control Group. Patients and caregivers each received three&#xD;
      separate, structured emotional support telephone calls with research staff (M duration = 13&#xD;
      minutes; SD = 6.5 minutes) to minimize differential drop-out with the RSV intervention group.&#xD;
      Control callers asked questions of participants and then engaged in supportive conversations&#xD;
      using empathic listening and reflection. Topics discussed included family, intergenerational&#xD;
      ties, and important aspects of the patient's life, but structured reminiscence and the&#xD;
      creative and therapeutic nature of legacy activities were not discussed.&#xD;
