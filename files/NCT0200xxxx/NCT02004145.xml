    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will perform an exploratory randomized trial of Positive&#xD;
      Psychology (PP). The trial will consist of 50 participants and will compare the impact of a&#xD;
      phone-based PP intervention vs. an attentional control condition, in Major Depressive&#xD;
      Disorder (MDD) patients who are hospitalized for SI or following a suicide attempt. This is a&#xD;
      12 week trial with 6 weeks of intervention and two blinded follow-up assessments at 6 and 12&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #1: To assess the feasibility and acceptability of the phone-based PP&#xD;
      intervention in this high-risk population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: The intervention will be feasible (with most patients completing at least 4/6 PP&#xD;
      and with follow-up data from at least 80% of subjects). The ratings of ease and subjective&#xD;
      helpfulness of the exercise and other mental states as measured before and after each PP&#xD;
      exercise will be more than 6 out of 10 and higher than the same ratings obtained from&#xD;
      subjects in the control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #2: To examine the impact of the six-session PP intervention on positive&#xD;
      psychological well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Compared to control subjects, subjects randomized to PP will have greater scores&#xD;
      on scales of optimism (measured via the Life Orientation Test-Revised [LOT-R]), gratitude&#xD;
      (Gratitude Questionnaire-6 [GQ-6]), and positive affect (Positive Affect Negative Affect&#xD;
      Schedule [PANAS]) at 6 and 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #3 (primary aim): To assess the impact of the PP intervention on key suicide&#xD;
      risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: PP subjects will have greater scores on scales of hopelessness (Beck Hopelessness&#xD;
      Scale [BHS]; primary study outcome measure), suicidal ideation (SI) (Concise Health Risk&#xD;
      Tracking scale [CHRT]), and depression (Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self&#xD;
      Report [QIDS-SR]) at 6 and 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also measure impact on readmission and suicide attempts to assess these key outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomized to receive the intervention or recollection (control) arm.&#xD;
      They will be randomized by a random-number generator and will be assigned a condition after&#xD;
      receiving baseline questionnaires. The RA/blinded assessor will be blind to the study&#xD;
      condition. The interventionist and subjects will not be blind to the study condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessments: After consent and eligibility rule outs, subjects will receive baseline&#xD;
      questionnaires to assess hopelessness (BHS46), suicidality (CHRT47), depression (QIDS-SR48),&#xD;
      and positive states (LOT-R,43 GQ-6,44 PANAS45). Then, subjects will be randomized via random&#xD;
      number generator to receive the control or intervention condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing baseline questionnaires and receiving randomization, subjects in both groups&#xD;
      will have a 20 minute initial in-hospital session (&quot;week #1&quot;), within a week of anticipated&#xD;
      discharge, in which the interventionist will provide a treatment manual specific to their&#xD;
      condition, review the rationale for the initial exercise, and assign the exercise. The next&#xD;
      day, the exercise will be reviewed and an exercise assigned for the next week. Immediately&#xD;
      after completing the exercise, subjects will rate (on a Likert scale of 1-5) ease of exercise&#xD;
      completion, overall utility, and initial impact on hopelessness/optimism, to assess immediate&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discharge from the hospital, subjects will have five 20 minute weekly phone sessions&#xD;
      (&quot;weeks #2-6&quot;) with a different exercise used each week (assigned in the same order to all&#xD;
      subjects). The phone sessions will include: (a) review of the prior week's exercise&#xD;
      (including subject ratings of ease and impact as in week #1), (b) discussion of the rationale&#xD;
      and assignment of the next week's exercise via a guided review of the study manual, and (c)&#xD;
      completion of the Clinical Status questions and the Clinical Global Improvement scale (CGI)&#xD;
      to monitor symptoms and improvement. Sessions will be audiotaped and random sessions reviewed&#xD;
      by our PP consultant to ensure fidelity to the intervention (and that other techniques, e.g.,&#xD;
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, are not used).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positive psychology (intervention condition)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercises. These were selected based on their superior performance in our pre-pilot study and&#xD;
      others' work:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gratitude for positive events: Subjects recall three events, small or large, in the&#xD;
           preceding week that were associated with satisfaction, happiness, pride, or other&#xD;
           positive states.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gratitude letter: Subjects write a letter of gratitude thanking a person for an act of&#xD;
           kindness; subject may, at their discretion, share the letter with the other person.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Performing acts of kindness: Subjects are instructed to complete three acts of kindness&#xD;
           in one day. The acts can be small or large, planned or spontaneous, but must be&#xD;
           expressly completed to be kind to another.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Using personal strengths: Subjects undergo a brief assessment of personal strengths,&#xD;
           then find a new way to use that strength in the next 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enjoyable and meaningful activities: Subjects complete a series of self-selected&#xD;
           activities that vary between those that bring immediate boosts in mood and those that&#xD;
           are more deeply meaningful.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Repetition of an exercise previously done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recollection (control condition) The recollection condition was selected because it has been&#xD;
      used in a prior study by our team of a phone-based positive psychology intervention and it&#xD;
      was found to be feasible and well-accepted. Each week, subjects will record recent life&#xD;
      events in a manual without describing emotions associated with the events. The nature,&#xD;
      setting, or type of events to be recorded will differ each week to provide variety and&#xD;
      maintain subjects' interest. This will be described as an intervention that may assist with&#xD;
      organization and hone recall of important life events. Also, as an attentional control, it&#xD;
      has a parallel structure to the experimental arm with a treatment manual, weekly exercises,&#xD;
      and weekly calls to review exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up 6 and 12 week phone call. After completion of the intervention (6 weeks), and then&#xD;
      at 12 weeks, a blinded study research assistant (RA) will call subjects at 6 and 12 weeks to&#xD;
      repeat measures of hopelessness (BHS), suicidality (CHRT), depression (QIDS-SR) and positive&#xD;
      states (e.g., GQ-6, PANAS, LOT-R). Subjects will also be asked to rate their overall&#xD;
      satisfaction with the treatment they received for their cardiac condition (outside of this&#xD;
      study) over the last 6 and 12 weeks on a scale of 1 (excellent) to 5 (poor). We will record&#xD;
      specific times that subjects would prefer to be called (and not to be called) for future&#xD;
      follow-ups, to reduce intrusion on subjects' lives. We will also send a postcard to subjects&#xD;
      reminding them of their upcoming study phone call. The blinded assessor will make 2 follow-up&#xD;
      phone calls (at 6 and 12 weeks) to gather information about outcomes. If subjects would&#xD;
      rather complete the questions in written form rather than over the phone, we will send them a&#xD;
      written packet at the time of each follow-up.&#xD;
