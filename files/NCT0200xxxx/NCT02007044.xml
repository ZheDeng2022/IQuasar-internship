  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies ibrutinib with or without rituximab in treating&#xD;
      patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia that has come back after treatment. Ibrutinib may&#xD;
      stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, may help the body's immune&#xD;
      system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and&#xD;
      spread. It is not yet known whether ibrutinib is more effective with or without rituximab in&#xD;
      treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate in treated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine safety and tolerability, the overall response rate (ORR), the estimated PFS,&#xD;
      changes in immune parameters (lymphocyte subpopulations, immunoglobulin levels) and biomarker&#xD;
      responses in relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients receiving ibrutinib (i)&#xD;
      versus ibrutinib and rituximab (iR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat&#xD;
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive ibrutinib as in Arm I beginning on day 1 or 2. Patients also receive&#xD;
      rituximab intravenously (IV) over 3-8 hours on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of course 1 and day 1 of&#xD;
      courses 2-6. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 60 days and then every 4&#xD;
      months for 5 years.&#xD;
