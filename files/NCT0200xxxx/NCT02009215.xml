      We propose to evaluate the community-level impact of intermittent preventive treatment (IPT)&#xD;
      for malaria in schoolchildren on clinical outcomes and malaria transmission, using a&#xD;
      cluster-randomised design in Jinja, Uganda. Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) will be&#xD;
      administered to schoolchildren monthly for up to six rounds of treatment during one school&#xD;
      year. Outcomes will be measured using surveys of communities, schoolchildren, and mosquito&#xD;
      vectors. Our proposal also includes health service research to evaluate the potential&#xD;
      feasibility of taking the programme to scale, which will guide future research and&#xD;
      implementation of the intervention, and help shape policies in Uganda and elsewhere in&#xD;
      Africa.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study objective: The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the impact of IPT for&#xD;
      malaria in schoolchildren using monthly DP, as compared with the current standard of care (no&#xD;
      IPT), on community-level indicators of malaria transmission. We will test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      malaria transmission, as measured by the prevalence of asexual parasitaemia and the&#xD;
      entomological inoculation rate (EIR), will be lower in communities surrounding the&#xD;
      intervention schools, than those surrounding the control schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study site: The study will be conducted in Jinja district, Uganda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clusters: A cluster will be defined as one primary day school plus the 100 closest households&#xD;
      surrounding the school. The clusters will be defined prior to randomisation using digitally&#xD;
      enumerated maps. We plan to include approximately 84 clusters in the study, with one school&#xD;
      per cluster; half will be randomised to the IPT intervention, and half to control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation: Randomisation will be conducted by the trial statistician, who is not directly&#xD;
      involved in the field activities. Primary schools will be stratified by type of ownership&#xD;
      (public vs private). Restricted randomisation will be employed to ensure balance on type of&#xD;
      school and geographical location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: The intervention will be delivered to children attending participating&#xD;
      primary schools that are randomised to the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IPT intervention: IPT with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) will be delivered to all&#xD;
      schools located in the intervention clusters. Treatment will be administered to participating&#xD;
      students monthly, for up to 6 rounds of IPT during one school year, and will not be blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of DP: All enrolled students will receive DP (Duo-cotexcin, Holley Cotec&#xD;
      Pharmaceuticals) given once a day for 3 consecutive days. DP will be dosed according to&#xD;
      weight-based guidelines. Full-strength DP tablets (40/320mg) will be administered orally by&#xD;
      study personnel, and all treatments will be directly observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation procedures: Outcomes will be measured through surveys of communities,&#xD;
      schoolchildren, and mosquito vectors. In addition, the safety of IPT with monthly DP, and the&#xD;
      potential feasibility of the IPT intervention will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Community surveys. Cross-sectional surveys of community residents living in households&#xD;
           randomly selected from each cluster will be conducted at baseline and at the end of&#xD;
           intervention.The community surveys will consist of two components: (1) a household&#xD;
           survey questionnaire administered to heads of households, and (2) a clinical survey&#xD;
           including laboratory testing of all household residents. The primary outcome of the&#xD;
           community surveys will be parasite prevalence as measured by microscopy. In the final&#xD;
           community survey, we plan to enroll 105 participants per cluster (8820 total).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. School surveys. Cross-sectional surveys of students randomly selected from each cluster&#xD;
           school will be conducted at baseline and at the end of intervention. The primary outcome&#xD;
           of the school surveys will be parasite prevalence as measured by microscopy. In the&#xD;
           final school survey, we plan to enroll 13 students per cluster (1092 total).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Entomology surveys. Mosquitos will be collected using Centers of Disease Control and&#xD;
           Prevention (CDC) light traps from 5 randomly selected households from 20 clusters in&#xD;
           each study arm (100 households per arm, 200 total), using a list randomly generated from&#xD;
           the enumeration database. Each house will be sampled once a month for the duration of&#xD;
           the study. The primary outcome of the entomology surveys will be EIR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Safety monitoring. Students enrolled in the intervention will be evaluated prospectively&#xD;
           for serious adverse events. To assess the impact of monthly IPT with DP on risk of&#xD;
           cardiotoxicity, a sub-set of participants (n=189) will be selected using convenience&#xD;
           sampling (from the intervention arm only) to participate in cardiac monitoring and a&#xD;
           pharmacokinetic study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Qualitative assessment. A qualitative study will run alongside the main trial, to&#xD;
           investigate the potential feasibility for integrating this intervention into routine&#xD;
           health services and school systems. We will conduct a historical review of published and&#xD;
           unpublished literature on programmes that have integrated health interventions into the&#xD;
           education sector; ethnographic observation of intervention activities; and in-depth&#xD;
           interviews with key stakeholders, and teachers and health workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytical plan&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Quantitative surveys: All data will be analysed on the basis of intention-to-treat, that&#xD;
           is, community residents and school children taking part in the final surveys will be&#xD;
           classified as participating in the intervention or control according to the&#xD;
           randomization assignment of the cluster they were surveyed in, regardless of whether&#xD;
           they (or their children) received the intervention or not. The primary outcome is&#xD;
           prevalence of asexual parasitaemia in the community surveys. Prevalence of asexual&#xD;
           parasitaemia in the school surveys and EIR are secondary outcome measures. An&#xD;
           individual-level approach to the analysis will be used due to the large number of&#xD;
           clusters per arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For binary outcomes, generalised linear Poisson models with log link function will be&#xD;
           used. The effect of the intervention will be quantified by calculation of a prevalence&#xD;
           risk ratio. For quantitative outcomes, linear regression models will be used. The effect&#xD;
           of the intervention will be quantified by calculation of difference in mean outcome.&#xD;
           Rate ratios will be used to describe the effect of the intervention on rates. An&#xD;
           estimate of the coefficient of variation, k, will be provided overall and for the&#xD;
           community survey for each age group (as defined by the stratified sampling).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The probability of selection for the final community survey was related to the sampling&#xD;
           frame which was determined by the expected parasite prevalence (which varies by age) in&#xD;
           age categories; &lt; 5 years, 5-15 years, &gt; 15 years. Therefore, the age structure of the&#xD;
           study population is not representative of the community population as a whole. Because&#xD;
           we are looking at the community effect we will use inverse probability weights based on&#xD;
           the age population structure of all clusters as recorded by the census survey. In&#xD;
           practice, each individual will be assigned one of three weights, generated using the&#xD;
           census survey, and based on their age as recorded at the final community survey.&#xD;
           Population estimates of prevalence will be obtained using svy commands with the cluster&#xD;
           as the primary sampling unit and age-related inverse probability weights. Children&#xD;
           selected for the school survey were randomly selected after stratification by class.&#xD;
           Households selected for the entomological survey were also randomly selected. No&#xD;
           weighting is therefore required for the analysis of either the school or entomological&#xD;
           surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The effect of the intervention will also be assessed using adjusted analyses. The&#xD;
           cluster-specific prevalence or mean from the baseline survey will be adjusted for where&#xD;
           available. Variables collected in the baseline community survey, which were imbalanced&#xD;
           between trial arms, and likely to be prognostic for outcomes will be adjusted for.&#xD;
           Secondary analyses will be conducted to assess whether the effect of the intervention&#xD;
           differs by age group or school type. The effect of the intervention for each outcome&#xD;
           will be examined by age group or school type and tests for interaction conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Qualitative data: The data analysis of the field notes and in-depth interviews will&#xD;
           follow a bottom-up approach, identifying repeating patterns in the data. Field notes&#xD;
           will be coded on a daily basis using qualitative data analysis software, NVivo (QSR&#xD;
           International, Cambridge, MA). Transcripts will be coded line-by-line, and then later&#xD;
           developing themes and theoretical constructs by grouping the base coding together. A&#xD;
           coding template will be developed and refined. Following the coding process, themes and&#xD;
           theoretical constructs will be developed from both the field notes and the interview&#xD;
           transcripts, and the analysis will be conducted with reference to the literature and&#xD;
           theory regarding school-based and cross-sectoral interventions. Following this analysis,&#xD;
           the interpretation will take on an applied stance, to seek out specific challenges and&#xD;
           opportunities for methods and content of interventions to support implementation of IPT.&#xD;
