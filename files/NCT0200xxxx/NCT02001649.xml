      Suicidal behaviors is known to aggregate in families. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate association between common polymorphisms in genes important for neurobiological&#xD;
      pathways linked to suicidal behaviors and suicide attempt among adolescents patient.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In France, suicide is the second leading cause of death among the 14-22 years population.&#xD;
      Suicide behavior (SB) spans a spectrum ranging from suicidal ideation to suicide attempts and&#xD;
      completed suicide. Several factors likely determine the predisposition to SB, including&#xD;
      biological factors and psychosocial stressors. For biological factors, convergent evidence&#xD;
      from adoption, family, and twin studies of suicide strongly suggests genetic contributions to&#xD;
      liability for SB. Although genetic factors play a role in SB, identifying specific genes&#xD;
      involved has proved challenging. Molecular-genetic technologies have made great advances in&#xD;
      the past decade, including genome- wide searches for disease-causing genes with the linkage&#xD;
      disequilibrium (LD) approach. Despite being a major public health problem in the youth&#xD;
      population, genetic associations studies regarding suicidal behavior in adolescence are still&#xD;
      rare. Genes that code for proteins involved in regulating serotonergic neurotransmission have&#xD;
      thus been major candidate genes for association studies of SB. Among them, genes for&#xD;
      serotonin metabolism (tryptophan hydroxylase, TPH), serotonin transport (5-HTT), and the&#xD;
      serotonergic 2A (5-HT2A) receptor have received the most research attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The identification of relevant genetic variants or SNPs in others genes which are involved in&#xD;
      the neurobiological pathways (which the alteration may contribute to a suicidal behavior) can&#xD;
      help not only to advance knowledge of the genetic bases of suicide but also to identify new&#xD;
      therapeutic targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of review of the literature, investigators will identify candidate genes that&#xD;
      have been reported to be associated with suicidal events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will target genes related to central serotonergic and noradrenergic&#xD;
      neurotransmission, and monoamine metabolism (MAOA). The investigators will also study genes&#xD;
      involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission (GRIK2, GRIA3) and in the HPA axis (FKBP5) and&#xD;
      genes that code for neurotrophic proteins (BDNF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA will be obtained from saliva. All genotyping will be carried out using standard&#xD;
      polymerase chain reaction-based techniques that are routinely used in the Human Genetics&#xD;
      Laboratory. DNA segments containing the target variable site will be amplified using unique&#xD;
      sequence flanking primers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests of association between genetic variant and suicide attempt will be conducted using Chi&#xD;
      squared and Armitage Trend Tests. Logistical regression analyses will be performed to&#xD;
      evaluate the contribution of individual genetic variant to the prediction of suicide attempt,&#xD;
      and to examine SNPs for potential gene-gene and gene-environment interactions.&#xD;
