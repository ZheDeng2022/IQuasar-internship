      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effects on retinal morphophysiology of full scatter single target panretinal&#xD;
      photocoagulation (PRP) versus full scatter multiple target panretinal photocoagulation (both&#xD;
      combined with intravitreous injections of ranibizumab) versus intravitreous ranibizumab (IVR)&#xD;
      alone in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint for this study is the mean change in the total area of active retinal&#xD;
      neovessels, as measured by fluorescein angiography leakage area, in mm2, from baseline to&#xD;
      week 48.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the mean changes in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), the mean changes in&#xD;
           central subfield foveal thickness (CSFT), the mean changes in wave B amplitude and&#xD;
           oscillatory potentials on a full-field electroretinogram (ERG), and the mean changes on&#xD;
           the peripheral visual field by static perimetry (30:2 strategy), from baseline to week&#xD;
           48.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the incidence of adverse events during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategic goal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the era of anti-VEGF treatment for retinal neovascularization 1, 2, 3, 4 , it is time to&#xD;
      determine what would be the best association of PRP + anti-VEGF for proliferative diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy (PDR), or still, if just intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment would be even better&#xD;
      regarding morphologic (new vessels area and CSFT) and functional parameters (BCVA, ERG&#xD;
      response and visual field).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Photocoagulation (thermal laser) was the first modality to be described for the treatment of&#xD;
      PDR. Different types of laser such as xenon, krypton, argon, red diode and green diode can be&#xD;
      used for this treatment. The Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) showed the&#xD;
      benefit of early treatment of PDR and of macular edema with laser photocoagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, several studies have reported loss of visual field after laser photocoagulation of&#xD;
      the bilateral full-scatter type (PRP) due to the expansion of the thermal injury, possibly&#xD;
      even compromising the ability to drive automotive vehicles according to the standards of the&#xD;
      transit authorities of some countries. Thus, this implies a greater impact on the quality of&#xD;
      life of the patient, especially if he is a young diabetic.6&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of new laser photocoagulation technologies is to provide a treatment that will&#xD;
      permit the development of a regenerative response of photoreceptors and of the retinal&#xD;
      pigment epithelium (RPE) with the minimum loss of photoreceptors and the minimum cicatricial&#xD;
      expansion of the thermal injury on the targeted RPE.7&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PASCAL photocoagulator (OptiMedica, Santa Clara, California) (a standard scanning laser)&#xD;
      was introduced in 2005 for retinal photocoagulation. The device functions as if it partially&#xD;
      automated the procedure by means of a shorter laser pulse (short pulse strategy) combined&#xD;
      with multiple simultaneous firings in a pattern, performing the procedure within a shorter&#xD;
      period of time and with less damage to the outer retina or the RPE, in addition to providing&#xD;
      better patient comfort.8&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding combined therapy, the combination of intravitreous injection of ranibizumab with&#xD;
      PRP (ETDRS) proved to be more promising in terms of improved visual acuity, stability of&#xD;
      macular thickness and a greater regression rate of neovessel areas than the use of PRP alone&#xD;
      (ETDRS) in patients with high risk PDR.1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, in the present study we would like to determine which would be the best therapeutic&#xD;
      combination of laser and an anti-VEGF drug for our patients, or whether treatment with an&#xD;
      anti-VEGF drug alone would be better in terms of the anatomical and functional parameters&#xD;
      proposed.&#xD;
