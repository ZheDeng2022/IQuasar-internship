  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effect of chloroquine in individuals infected with HIV.&#xD;
      Researchers will aim to determine if chloroquine treatment in participants whose viral loads&#xD;
      are suppressed on combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), results in improved immune&#xD;
      activation and CD4 cell recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will recruit 20 individuals and will last approximately 44 weeks. Eligible&#xD;
      participants will receive an oral dose of chloroquine (250 mg) once daily from week 8 through&#xD;
      week 32. All participants will be asked to have rectal biopsy samples (week 0 and week 32) to&#xD;
      study T cell immune activation in the mucosa rectal site.&#xD;

      Clinical data has identified chloroquine as a potential modulator of immune activation. The&#xD;
      study's dose of chloroquine is the same as the dose recommended for patients having&#xD;
      autoimmune diseases. In these autoimmune cases, a daily dose of chloroquine at 250 mg for 12&#xD;
      weeks has shown improvement in symptoms and decreases in inflammatory cytokines synthesis and&#xD;
      a reduction in TLR -mediated immune activation. Study findings could help provide information&#xD;
      about where and under what circumstances chloroquine treatment may reduce T cell activation&#xD;
      and help restore circulating CD4 T cells.&#xD;

    <description>This will be a single arm, pilot study with each subject as his/her own control. The study will last 44 weeks, with 8 weeks observation period on ART alone to assess stability of activated CD8CD38 T cells, followed by 24 weeks chloroquine treatment with ART and a 12-week follow-up period on ART alone. Twenty ART treated patients will be recruited. To maximize chances of demonstrating a treatment effect, the chloroquine will be administrated for 24 weeks.</description>
