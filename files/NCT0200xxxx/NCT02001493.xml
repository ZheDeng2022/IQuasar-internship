    <textblock>
      Antiangiogenics are the mainstay of treatment in patients with metastatic renal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma. Conventional clinical end-points, used to measure efficacy with chemotherapeutic&#xD;
      agents, have not been helpful in monitoring the efficacy of antiangiogenic therapy.&#xD;
      Increasing numbers of predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers are being investigated that&#xD;
      are useful surrogates for clinical response and also to identify patients early on who will&#xD;
      benefit from this class of agents. This is valuable in avoiding unnecessary toxicity in&#xD;
      patients and also in reducing cost implications of this expensive group of drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators wish to explore the variability of baseline metabolomic profile in the&#xD;
      blood and urine of patients with mRCC and characterise the inter-subject and intra-subject&#xD;
      variability. The study of the baseline levels has not been performed in this cohort&#xD;
      previously. This is extremely important in interpreting the emerging data of changes in the&#xD;
      levels of the various biomarkers from various trials. This will in turn help in the&#xD;
      development of future targeted therapies, especially Phase I/II studies where an early&#xD;
      demonstration of target modulation is vital. This study will also help to identify the number&#xD;
      of patients required for appropriate statistical evaluation in pharmacodynamic studies to&#xD;
      assess biological activity, optimisation of dosing, and investigation of potential mechanisms&#xD;
      of resistance. Study of the urinary and blood metabolomic profile in conjunction will give us&#xD;
      an insight into the potential use of urine as a diagnostic and prognostic tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES GOAL The main objective of the study is to determine the change from baseline in&#xD;
      metabolomic profiling in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma 1 month after&#xD;
      nephrectomy or antiangiogenic treatment during 2 months&#xD;

      METHODOLOGY STUDY DESIGN. Observational, Prospective, Exploratory, Single centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION Common Inclusion criteria Patients must be older than 18 years in age.&#xD;
      Written Informed Consent obtained. Patients previously informed about the objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with histologically confirmed renal clear cell carcinoma. Patients before surgery&#xD;
      with confirmed renal cell carcinoma or suspected. RCC must be confirmed after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria Presence of a separate malignant diagnosis, in the last two years, except&#xD;
      non-melanoma skin cancer or cervical carcinoma in situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior anti-cancer treatment for RCC other than nephrectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENDPOINTS Primary endpoint Determination the changes from baseline in metabolomic profiling&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes Time to progression Progression free survival (PFS) /Overall survival (OS)&#xD;
      Determination of metabolomic levels during the monitoring period Radiologically measured&#xD;
      tumour response (according to investigator assessment) Toxicities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures Primary The primary outcome measures are the changes from baseline in&#xD;
      metabolomic profiling 1 month after nephrectomy or after antiangiogenic treatment during 2&#xD;
      months Cohort 1. The primary clinical outcome measure is progression-free survival (PFS), the&#xD;
      interval from first line therapy to first evidence of progression disease or death from RCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2. The primary clinical outcome measure is to find differences in metabolomic profiles&#xD;
      between samples before and after nephrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary The main objective of the study is to determine the metabolomic basal levels in&#xD;
      patients with renal cell carcinoma clear cell and try to find out a prognostic profile&#xD;
      Metabolomic profile changes during the follow up. Tumour progression and PFS, i.e. the time&#xD;
      from surgery/first line treatment to progression RCC specific survival time, i.e. the time&#xD;
      from first line treatment to death from RCC Overall survival, i.e. the time from first line&#xD;
      treatment to death from any cause, including RCC Best response Toxicity and association with&#xD;
      metabolomic profile evaluation. Metabolomic characteristics of resected primary RCC. Tumour&#xD;
      samples will be examined for a relevant metabolomic profile, and their association with&#xD;
      outcome will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions PFS is defined as the time between the first day of treatment with any drug&#xD;
      (sunitinib, pazopanib, etc.) and the date of radiological progressive disease (PD), clear&#xD;
      clinical evidence of PD, or death. Patients who had not progressed at database closure will&#xD;
      be censored at final follow-up. If the date of PD is unknown, the investigators will censor&#xD;
      PFS at the last tumour assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall survival is defined as the time between the first day of &quot;drug&quot; treatment and the&#xD;
      date of death or last date of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective response will be assessed by treating doctors, according to Response Evaluation&#xD;
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.1, and classified as complete response,&#xD;
      partial response, stable disease, or PD. Timing for assessments will be dictated by&#xD;
      individual institution policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adverse effects will be graded by the attending doctors according to Common Terminology&#xD;
      Criteria for Adverse Events version 4•0. The investigators have initially selected mucositis,&#xD;
      hypothyroidism, hand-foot syndrome, hypertension, anaemia, and thrombocytopenia for analysis&#xD;
      on the basis of clinical relevance and grading objectiveness, together with grade 3-4 adverse&#xD;
      events. The investigators will also record adverse toxic events leading to dose reductions&#xD;
      and the date on which they occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will test metabolomic profile against PFS and overall survival with&#xD;
      Cox-regression analysis and against RECIST response with logistic regression analysis. The&#xD;
      investigators shall perform a multivariable analysis by including clinical factors associated&#xD;
      with PFS, overall survival, or response as covariates (clinical factors that will be&#xD;
      associated with p&lt;0•1 with a specific variable will be used as covariates for that specific&#xD;
      variable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will allocate patients to favourable, intermediate, and poor prognosis&#xD;
      groups according to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) prognostic&#xD;
      classification, and included this variable in the multivariable analysis. The investigators&#xD;
      will further analyse metabolomic profile associated with PFS and overall survival in the&#xD;
      multivariable analysis by the Kaplan-Meier method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will assess metabolomic levels/profile associated with an increased risk of&#xD;
      drug dose reduction caused by toxicity with Cox-regression modelling of the number of days of&#xD;
      drug treatment until the reduction of dose. Patients with no dose reductions will be censored&#xD;
      at final follow-up. For multivariable analysis, the investigators will use clinical factors&#xD;
      associated with p&lt;0•1 with dose reductions as covariates, and the investigators will analyse&#xD;
      the metabolomic levels associated to drug dose reduction in the multivariable analysis with&#xD;
      the Kaplan-Meier method. The investigators will study associations between specific drug&#xD;
      toxicities and metabolomic profiles with logistic regression analysis, with toxicity&#xD;
      development as a dichotomous endpoint. The multivariable logistic regression analyses will&#xD;
      include clinical factors associated with the corresponding outcome as covariates (factors&#xD;
      with p&lt;0•1). The investigators will test all genotypes with an additive genetic model. The&#xD;
      investigators will retain missing data as missing apart from MSKCC prognostic factors. The&#xD;
      most likely value, based on the data from the rest of the series, will be assigned to these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a general descriptive variables included in the study. Distributions will be&#xD;
      presented absolute and relative frequencies of qualitative variables, and measures of central&#xD;
      tendency and dispersion (mean standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum) for&#xD;
      quantitative variables. They will be presented with the confidence intervals at 95% for the&#xD;
      major outcome. No missing data imputed and left as missing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis test to be performed will be bilateral with a significance level of 0.05. For&#xD;
      variables that do not conform to the normal distribution (or parametric) will be used for&#xD;
      non-parametric tests in the analysis of contingency tables and for comparison of proportions&#xD;
      and / or frequency distributions, will be used the chi -square (or Fisher's exact where&#xD;
      appropriate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis of the data from the study will be conducted by Hutchison/MRC (Medical&#xD;
      Research Council) Research Center. Specific aspects of the statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis goal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: &quot;To determine the baseline metabolomic profiles in urine/blood in patients with&#xD;
      renal cell carcinoma clear in order to find a prognostic/predictive model&quot; Appropriate&#xD;
      regression models as well as univariate and multivariate statistical tests will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2: &quot;To determine the changes of metabolomic profiles before and 1 month after&#xD;
      nephrectomy&quot; Univariate and multivariate statistical tests for paired setting will be applied&#xD;
      to reveal the changes.&#xD;
