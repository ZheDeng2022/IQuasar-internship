    <textblock>
      Pain is the way our brain interprets certain bodily sensations. It is very difficult to&#xD;
      describe or to put into words as perception and tolerance of pain varies widely between&#xD;
      individuals. It is known that age, gender and past experience and memory of past experience&#xD;
      all contribute to patients' feelings of discomfort and tolerance of pain, but the reason why&#xD;
      some patients actually do not experience any pain at all post surgery is still unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because pain affects every person at some point in their lives, it is of utmost importance&#xD;
      that we can find more effective analgesic methods, and provide analgesia tailored to an&#xD;
      individual's need as well as discovering new methods which may be able to identify those&#xD;
      individuals who are more prone to suffering serious, or chronic pain. It has been proposed&#xD;
      that epigenetic modifications may play a role in sensitivity to analgesia and response to&#xD;
      trauma, such as post surgery. The effects of epigenetic changes on key genes and the role&#xD;
      this plays in analgesia sensitivity and pain perception is deserving of further research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epigenetics is a growing field of study in which there are genetic modifications that do not&#xD;
      involve changes to base sequences in a gene, but that result nonetheless in changes to gene&#xD;
      expression. It has long been known that changes in gene expression play an important role in&#xD;
      the establishment of pain states. But it is not known whether a priming injury can induce&#xD;
      lasting epigenetic marks which would result in an increase in both postoperative acute pain&#xD;
      and the risk for chronic pain. Only by fully understanding these epigenetic mechanisms will&#xD;
      we be able to offer better drugs for the treatment of pain, and to identify those at high&#xD;
      risk of postoperative pain and postsurgical chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether severity of pain following surgical&#xD;
      procedures, such as third molar surgery is related to baseline methylation status of the&#xD;
      promoter region of IL-6 and TNF-α and changes in methylation status post surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      (i) Subjects: Sixty subjects who will be undergoing third molar surgery (hereafter known as&#xD;
      'cases') will be recruited from The Queen Mary Hospital and The Prince Philip Dental Hospital&#xD;
      and sixty, aged and sex matched controls who will not be undergoing surgery in the next 3&#xD;
      months, nor have undergone surgery in the past year (hereafter known as 'controls') will also&#xD;
      be recruited from the Outpatients department of the same hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) Methods: The study aims and details will be explained to each subject and informed&#xD;
      consent will be sought from each of them. A pain diaryquestionnaire developed by our group&#xD;
      will be adapted for the use of assessing pain experienced by each subject pre and post&#xD;
      surgery. Research personnel will accompany each case subject, and fill out the pain&#xD;
      diaryquestionnaire with them during the visit when the patients' blood is taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following health questionaires will be completed by the subjects recruites:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SF-36: 8-scale profile of functional health and well-being scores as well as&#xD;
      psychometrically-based physical and mental health summary measures HADS: Assessment of the&#xD;
      psychological status of the subjects (anxiety &amp; depression)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain at rest and during opening will be assessed using a numerical rating scale (NRS, 1= no&#xD;
      pain, 10 = most severe pain) at the following time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Before surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 4 hourly after surgery for 16 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At 24th, 48th and 72nd after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 1 month after surgery by telephone interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 3 month after surgery by telephone interview. If pain is present, questions about&#xD;
           neuropathic pain will be asked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venous EDTA blood (10ml) on each occacasion will be drawn from each case one hour prior to&#xD;
      surgery, 1 hour and 3 hours post surgery. Then they will be asked to return to the hospital 3&#xD;
      to 5 days post surgery for one more blood taking, and macrophages will be separated from the&#xD;
      blood and total RNA will be extracted as soon as possible after blood taking from half the&#xD;
      total cells. The remainder of the cells (macrophages) will be stored at -80oC and batched for&#xD;
      DNA extraction. Venous EDTA blood (20ml) will be drawn from each control subject at a time&#xD;
      convenient to them and again, 3 to 5 days post first blood taking. The blood taken from the&#xD;
      control subjects will be treated in exactly the same way as with blood taken from the case&#xD;
      subjects. Therefore, four samples in total will be obtained from each case and control&#xD;
      subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The size of the IL-6 and TNF-α promoter regions spanning the sequences upstream of the&#xD;
      transcriptional start site as well as part of the first exon will be determined from&#xD;
      literature search and using a database for reference, CpG islands will be first identified&#xD;
      for primer design (http://www.cpgislands.com/). For analysis of methylation, a commercial kit&#xD;
      will be used (EpiTect Plus LyseAll Bisulfite Kit from Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will undergo bisulfite-conversion, and unmethylated cytosines will be deaminated,&#xD;
      forming uracils. Methylated cytosines will remain unchanged. The location of the methylated&#xD;
      cytosine of the gene sequence and the amount of methylated cytosine will be identified and&#xD;
      quantitated by Pyrosequencing using established techniques. Results will be expressed as %&#xD;
      methylation in the promoter region of IL-6 and NF-ĸB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: The pyrosequencing technique can only analyse fragments of DNA of up to 50 base pairs&#xD;
      in one reaction. According to data from CpG Island Searcher, and when the % GC was set at&#xD;
      55%, observed CpG/expected CpG set at 0.65 and gaps between adjacent islands set at 100bp, no&#xD;
      CpG islands can by found in either the IL-6, or the TNFα promoter. Therefore, the methylation&#xD;
      status of the whole promoter region in both genes will be studied using 40 pairs of primers&#xD;
      for each gene (in order to cover 2kb of the promoter region). This approach is adopted as it&#xD;
      is the most sensitive and reliable for determination of site specific DNA methylation in an&#xD;
      extended region such as a promoter region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iii) Study design: This is a case-control study. The samples used in this study will be&#xD;
      whole blood samples taken pre- and post- surgery from the cases, and at a matched time, from&#xD;
      the controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculations: No data exist on the level of DNA methylation in the promoter region of&#xD;
      IL-6 and TNF-α in normal healthy subjects. Power calculations reveal that 51 subjects in each&#xD;
      group are required to have an 80% power to detect a true difference in the variable of&#xD;
      interest at 5% significance level (calculations using G*Power software, version 3.1). A total&#xD;
      of 60 subjects will be recruited into each group to take into consideration drop out rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iv) Data processing and analysis: Paired t-test (or non-parametric equivalent) will be&#xD;
      performed to investigate differences in level of DNA methylation pre- and post- surgery.&#xD;
      Unpaired t-test will be used to investigate difference in the level of DNA methylation&#xD;
      between cases and controls. Correlational analysis will be used to investigate relationships&#xD;
      between methylation status and IL-6 and TNF-α expression. Descriptive statistics will be&#xD;
      employed to describe the changes in methylation status (i.e., if different sites in the CpG&#xD;
      island are methylated) in the promoter region of IL-6 and TNF-α B, pre-post surgery and in&#xD;
      the two different sampling time points of the control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose and potential: This is a pilot, exploratory environmental-epigenetics study on the&#xD;
      effect of bilateral third molar surgery on DNA methylation changes in the promoter region of&#xD;
      IL-6 and NF-ĸB, and the influence of methylation status on gene expression. The results will&#xD;
      provide insight and promote understanding into the molecular mechanisms through which the&#xD;
      methylation status of inflammatory genes can affect the experience of pain post surgery.&#xD;
