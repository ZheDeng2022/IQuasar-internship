  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer (PCa) is currently the most common neoplastic disease among men in&#xD;
      well-developed countries with 350 000 new cases diagnosed annually in Europe and 4 800 in&#xD;
      Finland. Due to widespread use of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) in asymptomatic men,&#xD;
      most patients present initially with localized disease. Radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy&#xD;
      (RT) and active surveillance are the most common management options for patients with&#xD;
      localized PCa. Proper preoperative staging for patients with adverse features on biopsy who&#xD;
      are candidates for radical prostatectomy is urgently needed. For elderly men external beam RT&#xD;
      is the preferred modality which can be safely performed utilizing modern techniques such as&#xD;
      intensity modulated and image guided radiotherapy (IMRT and IGRT). Since randomized studies&#xD;
      suggest a dose response effect beyond 78-80 Gy newer techniques aim at dose escalation&#xD;
      provided that toxicity can be controlled. Therefore, ultra high dose IMRT/IGRT requires&#xD;
      visualization of intracapsular disease which will receive the highest dose. Taken together,&#xD;
      the use of accurate anatomical and functional imaging modalities are essential for planning&#xD;
      both nerve sparing radical prostatectomy and ultra high dose IMRT/IGRT Fluorine-18 labeled&#xD;
      L-leucine analogue 1-amino-3-fluorocyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid (FACBC) has shown to&#xD;
      preferentially accumulate in PCa and its nodal metastases. By assisting in localization of&#xD;
      intraprostatic and pelvic disease FACBC with hybrid positron emission tomography/computed&#xD;
      tomography (PET/CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) has potential to improve&#xD;
      selection of patients for robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and IMRT/IGRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anatomical MRI at 1.5 Tesla (T) compared with transrectal ultrasound has demonstrated a&#xD;
      higher sensitivity for tumor detection but almost the same specificity, stressing the need&#xD;
      for additional metabolic MRI. Advanced application of MRI such as proton magnetic resonance&#xD;
      spectroscopy (1H MRS), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast enhanced imaging&#xD;
      (DCE-MRI) are increasingly being used for detection and characterization of PCa. The use of&#xD;
      3T scanners and multiparametric MRI (mpMRI), consisting of anatomical MRI, DWI, 1H MRS and&#xD;
      DCE-MRI, demonstrated very promising result for staging and detection of PCa.&#xD;

      Specific aims of the current study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) To determine the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of multiparametric 3T MRI,&#xD;
      (anatomical MRI, DCE-MRI, DWI and 1H MRS) combined with FACBC PET/CT and PET/MRI in&#xD;
      correlation with systematic biopsy and whole mount prostatectomy specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) To asses the applicability of multiparametric 3T MRI combined with FACBC-PET/CT and&#xD;
      PET/MRI for detection of cancer aggressiveness based on Gleason score and PSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii) To develop quantitative and qualitative methods for evaluation of FACBC PET/MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv) To develop and validate an imaging protocol which will become the standard protocol for&#xD;
      prostate imaging both for surgical and radiotherapy patients at Turku PET Centre using hybrid&#xD;
      PET/MRI&#xD;
