  <brief_summary>

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Mississippi Delta (which includes the counties along the Mississippi River) is one&#xD;
           of the poorest areas in the United States. Women living in the Mississippi Delta have&#xD;
           disproportionately high rates of cervical cancer, but they are unlikely to come to&#xD;
           clinics except perhaps for giving birth, years before they are diagnosed with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To improve rates of screening, researchers are attempting an outreach study to see&#xD;
           whether under-screened women, if approached by door-to-door recruitment, would get&#xD;
           screened by one of two methods (home-based self-collection and testing, or a clinic&#xD;
           exam) and which method they would prefer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To assess/measure increased participation of under-screened women living in the Mississippi&#xD;
      Delta in cervical cancer screening by offering women the opportunity to get screened by one&#xD;
      of two possible community outreach-based cervical cancer screening modalities,&#xD;
      self-collection and HPV testing or clinic-based cytology screening, the current standard of&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Women between 26 and 65 years of age, who are not pregnant currently or in the past 8&#xD;
      weeks, have an intact cervix, have no history of cancer, and have not been screened for&#xD;
      cervical cancer in the past 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will recruit participants on a door-to-door basis. Researchers will recruit&#xD;
           all eligible women within a household. Recruitment will be done only during daylight&#xD;
           hours but at the end of the working day to maximize the chances of finding women at&#xD;
           home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible women willing to participate will complete a questionnaire with demographic and&#xD;
           medical information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to choose the screening method of their preference. If they&#xD;
           choose self-collection with HPV testing, they will be given a self-collection kit and&#xD;
           asked to perform the self-collection and return the kit within 1 month. Participants who&#xD;
           choose to have cytology screening will be provided with the phone number and location of&#xD;
           the local health department clinic and will be encouraged to schedule their screening&#xD;
           within the following month.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women who do not complete their participation within 1 month will be considered&#xD;
           noncompliant with their chosen intervention. Researchers will re-contact noncompliant&#xD;
           women to offer them participation in the study, including permitting them to refuse to&#xD;
           participate or to choose the alternative intervention....&#xD;

      We have been conducting a study of self-collected cervicovaginal specimens and carcinogenic&#xD;
      human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing for cervical cancer screening of women living in the&#xD;
      Mississippi Delta, who have disproportionately high rates of cervical cancer. To date, we&#xD;
      have noted high levels of participation as well as high percentages of completion and return&#xD;
      of the home self-collection. Although we have recruited some under-screened women into our&#xD;
      study, it was clinic-based (i.e., under-screened women were still required to come to the&#xD;
      health department clinic), using Mississippi State Department of Health district clinics. In&#xD;
      reality, women who get cervical cancer in the Mississippi Delta are unlikely to come to&#xD;
      clinics except perhaps for giving birth, years before they are diagnosed with cancer. Thus,&#xD;
      as an ancillary study to our work in Mississippi, we are proposing an outreach study to&#xD;
      determine whether under-screened women, if approached via door-to-door recruitment, would&#xD;
      participate (get screened) by one of two community outreach-based cervical cancer screening&#xD;
      modalities, home-based self-collection and HPV testing or clinic-based cytology screening,&#xD;
      and which of the two modalities they prefer. We will recruit door-to-door 400 under-screened,&#xD;
      eligible women aged 26-65 years living in the Mississippi Delta. Consenting, eligible women&#xD;
      will be given a choice of taking and using a self-collection kit on their own or coming to&#xD;
      the local Health Department clinic for cervical cytology screening. Under the assumption that&#xD;
      only 5% of this under-screened population would choose to undergo screening without&#xD;
      intervention, recruitment of 400 women into the study will permit us to detect a 2-fold&#xD;
      increase in participation in screening (defined as completing screening) with 90% power&#xD;
      (alpha = 0.05). In this scenario, we will be able to detect with 90% power (alpha = 0.05) a&#xD;
      25% preference for one of the screening methods (75% vs. 50% (no preference)).&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are age 26-65 years, not pregnant currently or in the past 8 weeks, who have&#xD;
             an intact cervix, no history of cancer, have not been screened for cervical cancer in&#xD;
             the last 3 years, and able and competent to provide informed consent will be&#xD;
             considered eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women under 26 or over 65 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women or women who have given birth to a child in the past 8 weeks. To insure&#xD;
             women included in the study are not pregnant, we will ask women during the consenting&#xD;
             process if they are pregnant or gave recently given birth. Women who answer yes for&#xD;
             either query will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who have had a total hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of cervical cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Screened for cervical cancer in the last 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other reasons to exclude women include the inability to speak English, the appearance&#xD;
             of mental incompetence, or refusal to participate or sign the informed consent form.&#xD;
