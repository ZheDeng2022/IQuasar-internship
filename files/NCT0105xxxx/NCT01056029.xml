    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm, dose-escalation Phase I study to determine the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) of G-202 (mipsagargin) when administered once daily for 3 consecutive&#xD;
      days of a 28-day cycle in patients with advanced solid tumors. G-202 will be administered by&#xD;
      intravenous infusion over 1 hour on Days 1, 2 and 3 of each 28-day cycle.&#xD;

      Pro-drug chemotherapy is an approach to cancer treatment that is being investigated as a&#xD;
      means to achieve higher concentrations of cytotoxic or biologically active agents at a tumor&#xD;
      location while avoiding systemic toxicity. With pro-drug chemotherapy, a relatively non-toxic&#xD;
      form of a cytotoxin, the pro-drug, is converted into the active cytotoxic agent at the tumor&#xD;
      site or other specific location. G-202 (mipsagargin) is a thapsigargin pro-drug; it consists&#xD;
      of a cytotoxic analog of thapsigargin coupled to a masking peptide which inhibits its&#xD;
      biologic activity until proteolytic cleavage at the tumor site. Thapsigargin is a natural&#xD;
      product with profound effects on cell viability. Thapsigargin is a non-cell-type specific&#xD;
      toxin with documented ability to kill a broad spectrum of cancer cell lines as well as normal&#xD;
      endothelial cells, fibroblasts and osteoblasts. It induces a rapid and pronounced increase in&#xD;
      the concentration of cytosolic calcium, due to blockade of the Sarcoplasmic/Endoplasmic&#xD;
      Reticulum Calcium ATPase (SERCA) pump to which it binds with high affinity. The increase in&#xD;
      cytosolic calcium leads to induction of apoptosis and ensuing cell death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anti-tumor effect of G-202 in humans with advanced solid tumors is not yet known.&#xD;
