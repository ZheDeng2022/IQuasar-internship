      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if Tarceva Â® (erlotinib) when taken&#xD;
      before and after radiation and/or surgery can help to control aggressive cutaneous squamous&#xD;
      cell carcinoma. The safety of the drug will also be studied.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Erlotinib is designed to block the activity of a protein found on the surface of many tumor&#xD;
      cells that may control tumor growth and survival. This may stop tumors from growing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Treatment/Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take erlotinib before&#xD;
      surgery and/or radiation therapy (Induction Treatment). After surgery and/or radiation you&#xD;
      will take erlotinib for up to 1 year (Maintenance Phase).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take erlotinib 1 time every day, by mouth, with a full glass of water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take erlotinib at about the same time every day. If you miss a dose and there is at&#xD;
      least 12 hours before the next dose is due, you will need to take the missed dose. You should&#xD;
      then take your next dose as scheduled. If you vomit after taking the tablet, the dose should&#xD;
      be replaced only if the tablet can actually be seen. Erlotinib should be taken 1 hour before&#xD;
      and 2 hours after meals and other drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you have side effects from erlotinib, the study doctor may lower your dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When you stop taking erlotinib during induction will depend on if the disease gets worse, if&#xD;
      the doctor thinks you are benefitting, and if you will receive surgery and/or radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take erlotinib for up to 10 weeks before starting local therapy. If the doctor&#xD;
      thinks you are benefitting, you may take erlotinib for longer than 10 weeks before starting&#xD;
      surgery and/or radiation. If the disease gets worse before 10 weeks, you will stop taking&#xD;
      erlotinib and have surgery and/or radiation right away.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery/Radiation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Week 4, the doctor will decide if the disease is resectable or unresectable and will&#xD;
      schedule the type of local therapy (surgery and/or radiation) that you will receive. If You&#xD;
      will sign separate consents for the surgery and/or radiation, which will describe the&#xD;
      procedure(s) and the risks in detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resectable Disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the disease is resectable, you will be scheduled to have surgery. If the doctor thinks it&#xD;
      is needed, you may have radiation therapy after the surgery. Radiation therapy usually will&#xD;
      start 4-8 weeks following your surgery, if the surgical site has healed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take erlotinib until 7 days before your surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unresectable Disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the disease is unresectable, you will be scheduled to have radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take erlotinib until you begin the radiation therapy. If your doctor thinks you are&#xD;
      benefiting from erlotinib, you will continue taking it during the radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you complete your radiation therapy, if the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will restart erlotinib at 4-8 weeks after surgery, if the surgical site has healed. If&#xD;
      you have radiation therapy after the surgery, you will take erlotinib during the radiation&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you only received radiation therapy, you will continue erlotinib after you finish your&#xD;
      radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take erlotinib by mouth every day for up to 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 before Induction Therapy and then every 2 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked be asked about any side effects you may have had and any drugs you may&#xD;
           be taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about your smoking status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The tumor will be measured by physical exam using rulers and/or calipers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pictures will be taken of the same areas that were photographed during screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are taking anti-coagulant medication, blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn&#xD;
           to check your blood clotting function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Week 4, you will have a CT scan or MRI scan to check the status of the disease. If you&#xD;
      continue taking erlotinib for at least 4 more weeks (a total of 8 weeks) before surgery or&#xD;
      radiation is started, the CT or MRI will be repeated then.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Week 4 and within 14 days before you start maintenance therapy, you will complete&#xD;
      questionnaires about how you are feeling and your overall quality of life. The questionnaires&#xD;
      will take about 10-15 minutes total to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 before Maintenance Therapy and then every 8 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any side effects you have had and any drugs you may be taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about your smoking status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The tumor will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pictures will be taken of the same areas that were photographed during screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a CT scan or MRI scan to check the&#xD;
           status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests, including tests to check&#xD;
           your blood clotting function (Day 1 only).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are taking anti-coagulant medication, blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn&#xD;
           to check for blood clotting function (every 8 weeks only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Weeks 24 and 52, you will complete the questionnaires about how you are feeling and&#xD;
      your overall quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you only received radiation therapy, you will have a CT scan or MRI scan 3 months after&#xD;
      the radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take the study drug for up to 1 year after the surgery/radiation. You will be taken&#xD;
      off study if the disease gets worse, if you have intolerable side effects, or if the doctor&#xD;
      thinks it is in your best interest to stop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Treatment Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 30 days after the last dose of study drug, the following tests and procedures will be&#xD;
      performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may have had and about any drugs you may be&#xD;
           taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a CT scan or MRI to check the status of&#xD;
           the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-Term Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the end-of-treatment visit, you will be contacted every 3 months during Year 1 and&#xD;
      every 6 months during Years 2 and 3 to collect information about how you are doing, any&#xD;
      treatment you have received, and any other side effects you have experienced. You (or your&#xD;
      family members or designees) may be contacted by telephone, in writing, by e-mail, or during&#xD;
      clinic visits. This information may also be collected by checking your medical record. This&#xD;
      follow-up will also consist of a physical exam if you are being seen at MD Anderson for your&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Erlotinib is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. It is investigational to give erlotinib before&#xD;
      and after radiation and/or surgery for the treatment of aggressive cutaneous squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 25 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

          7. Patient with a history of an invasive malignancy (other than the one treated in this&#xD;
             study) or lymphoproliferative disorder within the past 5 years. Patients with a&#xD;
             history of adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ of&#xD;
             the breast or carcinoma in situ of the cervix are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patient with history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical&#xD;
             or biologic composition to erlotinib.&#xD;

             requiring parenteral antibiotics at time of study registration, psychiatric illness&#xD;
             that would limit compliance with study requirements or symptomatic congestive heart&#xD;
             failure (NYHA class II or greater), unstable angina pectoris or cardiac arrhythmia&#xD;
             requiring maintenance medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patient with a history of pulmonary fibrosis (other than in a radiated field) or&#xD;
             chronic liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients with active gastrointestinal disease or a disorder that alters&#xD;
             gastrointestinal motility or absorption; for example, a significant surgical resection&#xD;
             of the stomach or small bowel, uncontrolled inflammatory bowel disease or uncontrolled&#xD;
             chronic diarrhea.&#xD;

        <description>Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria for CR = complete response, PR = partial response, SD = stable disease, PD = progressive disease, and NE = inevaluable. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. Partial Response (PR): &gt;30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, reference baseline sum diameters. Progressive Disease (PD): &gt;20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, reference smallest sum on study (this includes baseline sum if is smallest on study). In addition to relative increase of 20%, sum must absolute increase at least 5 mm. (Note: appearance of 1/&gt; new lesions also considered progression). Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, reference smallest sum diameters while on study. Not evaluable (NE): Inevaluable when no imaging/measurement done</description>
