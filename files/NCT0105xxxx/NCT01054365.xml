      In comparison to delayed hospital discharge, a strategy of early hospital discharge of&#xD;
      patients who undergo single and multivessel stenting for type A, B, and C lesion(s) using&#xD;
      thienopyridine and a hemostatic femoral closure device, is associated with similar clinical&#xD;
      outcomes, but greater patient satisfaction and similar cost.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a single center prospective, randomized, non-inferiority study of&#xD;
      four-hundred patients with stable and unstable angina (CCS class I-IV), type A, B, C&#xD;
      lesion(s), single and multivessel disease undergoing single or multivessel coronary artery&#xD;
      stenting. All patients will be screened and consented prior to the coronary artery stenting&#xD;
      procedure. All patients will receive an oral bolus of a thienopyridine as pre-treatment or&#xD;
      immediately after stent implantation. All patients will be anticoagulated with bilvalirudin&#xD;
      or heparin during the procedure. Common femoral angiography will be performed at the end of&#xD;
      the procedure via the side-arm of the sheath in the ipsilateral oblique view (20-40Â°). In&#xD;
      patients with visible atherosclerotic disease or small common femoral arteries on angiography&#xD;
      the size and/or the degree of stenosis will be measured by quantitative angiography.&#xD;
      Hemostasis of the femoral-arteriotomy access site will be facilitated by deployment of a&#xD;
      hemostatic closure device (StarClose or ProGlide). Patients will be screened and consented&#xD;
      prior to cardiac catheterization. If the stenting procedure is performed without&#xD;
      complications and the hemostatic closure device successfully deployed the patient will then&#xD;
      be evaluated four hours after the completion of the procedure; if there are no complications&#xD;
      and the patient is able to ambulate, he/she will be randomized and enrolled into either the&#xD;
      early discharge group (EDG) or the delayed discharge group (DDG). Subjects will not be&#xD;
      considered enrolled into the study until they have been successfully randomized into either&#xD;
      the EDG or DDG group. Patients in the early discharge group (EDG, n=200) will be dismissed&#xD;
      from the hospital six hours after hemostatic closure device deployment if the vital signs are&#xD;
      stable, no bleeding complications are present, are ambulatory, there are no&#xD;
      electrocardiographic changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia and/or arrhythmia and are free&#xD;
      of chest pain. Patients in the delayed discharge group (DDG, n=200) will be dismissed from&#xD;
      the hospital after the procedure at the discretion of the attending cardiologist but no&#xD;
      sooner than 24 hours after PCI. Patients with an indication for extended hospital stay will&#xD;
      not be discharged regardless of randomization. A detailed screening log will be kept to track&#xD;
      the number of patients screened and consented and will include reason for screening failure&#xD;
      (exclusion criteria, procedure related complications, closure device failure, access&#xD;
      complication, chest pain, arrhythmias, hemodynamic instability, etc.&#xD;

        This study will include four-hundred consented patients undergoing percutaneous coronary&#xD;
        stenting at the University of Southern California Hospital or LA County Hospital, patients&#xD;
        in the study group will be discharged the day of the procedure whereas patients in the&#xD;
        control group will be discharged at the discretion of the attending cardiologist not&#xD;
        earlier than 24 hours after their procedure. Patients will be stratified on the basis of&#xD;
        their initial clinical presentation, as determined by the medical history, physical&#xD;
        examination, ECG and laboratory studies. Patients must be hemodynamically stable, and able&#xD;
        to understand and sign an informed consent.&#xD;
