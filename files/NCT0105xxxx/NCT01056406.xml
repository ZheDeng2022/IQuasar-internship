      The purpose of this study is to determine if twice monthly interaction with a registered&#xD;
      dietitian from 6-16 weeks gestation through 6 months postpartum will help women who are&#xD;
      overweight or obese gain weight during pregnancy closer to the Institute of Medicine&#xD;
      (IOM)guidelines and lose weight more effectively within the 6 month postpartum period than&#xD;
      those who do not receive twice monthly interaction with a registered dietitian during this&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overweight/obesity can lead to a number of adverse pregnancy, delivery and birth outcomes,&#xD;
      including increased risk of hypertension, eclampsia, and diabetes during pregnancy,&#xD;
      miscarriage, premature delivery, birth injuries, neural tube defects, and prenatal death.&#xD;
      More than half of women of childbearing age are overweight or are obese. Women of color and&#xD;
      low-income women are affected disproportionately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, women know little, if anything, about the impact of overweight and obesity on&#xD;
      pregnancy and health care providers are unsure how to effectively address the problem with&#xD;
      their patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A limited number of programs have tested ways to effectively address weight gain management&#xD;
      during pregnancy. None have been successful in addressing weight gain in women who are obese&#xD;
      or overweight at the start of pregnancy. The 2-year Revere Health Center Pregnancy Weight&#xD;
      Management Study will test the feasibility and efficacy of providing pregnant women who are&#xD;
      overweight or obese with regular access to a registered dietitian during and after pregnancy&#xD;
      to help achieve total weight gain closer to recommended guidelines and to ensure the best&#xD;
      outcomes for the mother and her newborn.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Revere Pregnancy and Weight Management Study has been designed to test the hypothesis&#xD;
      that women with a BMI &gt; 25 and &lt; 40 who receive information about the risks of excessive&#xD;
      weight gain during pregnancy and bimonthly interventions from a registered dietitian from the&#xD;
      beginning of their pregnancy (6-16 weeks gestation) through 6 months postpartum, will achieve&#xD;
      total weight gain closer to IOM (Institute of Medicine) guidelines and will have fewer&#xD;
      complications as compared to women who only receive information about the risks of excessive&#xD;
      weight gain (i.e. Current standard of optimal care). In addition, we hope to find that women&#xD;
      who participate in the program will increase physical activity and show improvement in&#xD;
      overall nutritious food choices as will be measured by the results of a nutrition and&#xD;
      physical activity questionnaire completed by all participants at 3 points during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be managed completely by a registered dietitian who has experience working&#xD;
      with pregnant women. The dietitian will have direct access to the participants' primary&#xD;
      clinicians for consultation throughout the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients, regardless of whether in the control or intervention group, will receive the&#xD;
      optimal standard of prenatal and postpartum care and any additional care needed to ensure the&#xD;
      best outcomes for the mother and newborn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Everyone in the study will meet with the dietitian who works at the Revere Health Center at&#xD;
      least one time. During the initial visit, participants will receive information about healthy&#xD;
      eating and exercise during pregnancy. Women will also receive information about risks to&#xD;
      mother and baby related to excessive weight gain during pregnancy for overweight and obese&#xD;
      women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women in the control group will have no further interaction with the study dietitian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women in the intervention group will meet with the dietitian at least twice per month. The&#xD;
      contact with the dietitian may include face-to-face individual counseling, telephone or&#xD;
      e-mail follow-up, group classes or group activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data that will be collected and analyzed will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic information&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical and Pregnancy History&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy, labor, and delivery complications to mother and baby&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Birth record&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight change during pregnancy and after delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in physical activity and food choices&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through bimonthly contact with the dietitian, women will learn about healthier eating habits&#xD;
      and exercise while monitoring weight gain to help adhere to IOM guidelines. We hope to see&#xD;
      improved pregnancy, labor, and delivery outcomes for mothers and babies and help women&#xD;
      achieve postpartum weight loss. We intend to foster an increased interest and knowledge about&#xD;
      nutrition that will carry over to healthier food choices to share with their families and&#xD;
      with other women.&#xD;
