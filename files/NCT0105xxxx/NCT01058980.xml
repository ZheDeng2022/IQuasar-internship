  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disorder, impairs quality of life&#xD;
      and increases stroke risk and mortality. Despite advances in medical treatment, AF remains&#xD;
      uncontrolled in many patients. In many patients, AF is initiated by abnormal electrical&#xD;
      impulses from the pulmonary veins. A catheter ablation procedure called pulmonary vein&#xD;
      isolation (PVI) has therefore been developed, using heat to isolate the PV foci from the&#xD;
      heart. PVI is very effective, but must be repeated in up to 50% of cases because the foci&#xD;
      isolation is not permanent after initial PVI. The intravenous administration of a drug called&#xD;
      adenosine during the PVI procedure can unmask residual conduction that would otherwise remain&#xD;
      unnoticed, so-called &quot;dormant conduction&quot;. In our experience, additional ablation guided by&#xD;
      adenosine reduces AF recurrence and the need for a repeat PVI procedure. However, the&#xD;
      adenosine-guided approach has not yet been proven as standard therapy. The present study, to&#xD;
      be conducted at 15 clinical centres in Canada, Europe and Australia is therefore intended to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of adenosine-guided ablation to prevent AF recurrence. Five hundred&#xD;
      twenty-six patients will be included in the study, which should be completed within 2 years.&#xD;
      In all patients, the presence of dormant conduction will be tested with adenosine during PVI.&#xD;
      If dormant conduction is observed, additional ablation will be performed in half of these&#xD;
      patients selected randomly. If there is no dormant conduction, randomly selected patients&#xD;
      will be followed in a registry. If the adenosine-guided approach is demonstrated to improve&#xD;
      the success rate of PVI procedures, it should become the standard approach for a &quot;permanent&#xD;
      cure&quot; of AF, and therefore benefit patients by reducing arrhythmia recurrence,&#xD;
      hospitalizations and the need for repeat interventions.&#xD;

      Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most frequently treated cardiac arrhythmia, impairs quality of&#xD;
      life and increases stroke risk and mortality. Despite advances in antiarrhythmic drug&#xD;
      therapy, AF remains uncontrolled in many patients. More effective measures to prevent, treat&#xD;
      and potentially cure AF are needed. Ectopic foci originating from pulmonary veins (PVs)&#xD;
      initiate AF in many patients. PV isolation (PVI), in which PV conduction is eliminated by&#xD;
      catheter ablation, has emerged as an effective treatment in selected patients. However AF&#xD;
      recurs in up to 50%, due to recovery of PV conduction. Dormant PV conduction (PV conduction&#xD;
      suppressed at time of PVI with subsequent recovery) has been proposed to explain recurrences.&#xD;
      We demonstrated that adenosine can restore conduction in viable PVs after attempted PVI by&#xD;
      activating outward K+-currents, leading to selective hyperpolarization of PV cardiomyocytes&#xD;
      and removal of voltage-dependent Na+-channel inactivation. Thus, adenosine can be used to&#xD;
      differentiate permanent PV-atrial block from dormant PV conduction and to identify the need&#xD;
      for additional ablation. We recently performed a pilot study in 47 patients, in whom&#xD;
      adenosine was used to guide additional ablation. Results were compared to 47 historical&#xD;
      controls. Dormant conduction was observed in 55% of patients undergoing PVI and additional&#xD;
      adenosine-guided ablation decreased the AF recurrence rate from 49% to 21%. An&#xD;
      adequately-powered prospective randomized controlled clinical trial is required to confirm&#xD;
      these findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the proposed ADVICE trial is to evaluate the impact of&#xD;
      adenosine-guided PVI in preventing AF recurrences among patients with paroxysmal AF. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that a PVI ablation strategy that incorporates elimination of dormant conduction&#xD;
      unmasked by intravenous adenosine will decrease symptomatic AF recurrence compared to&#xD;
      standard PVI, without incurring significant additional risk. This prospective randomized&#xD;
      study will be conducted at 15 clinical centers in Canada, Europe and Australia. Patients with&#xD;
      paroxysmal AF referred for PVI will be recruited. Standard PVI will be performed in all&#xD;
      patients until elimination of PV conduction. All patients will subsequently receive&#xD;
      intravenous adenosine in an attempt to unmask dormant conduction. If dormant conduction is&#xD;
      elicited, patients will be randomized to no further ablation (Group 1; control) or additional&#xD;
      adenosine-guided ablation until dormant conduction is abolished (Group 2; adenosine-guided&#xD;
      PVI). If no dormant conduction is revealed, randomly selected patients will be followed in a&#xD;
      registry to further assess the role of dormant conduction as a predictor of AF recurrence.&#xD;
      Portable electrocardiographic monitors will be provided to all patients. The primary outcome&#xD;
      will be the time to first documented symptomatic AF episode post-PVI based on an&#xD;
      intention-to-treat analysis. Since symptomatic AF recurrence is anticipated in 45% of&#xD;
      controls, 210 patients with dormant conduction are required in order to be able to detect a&#xD;
      difference of 20%, with a power of at least 85%. Assuming the presence of dormant conduction&#xD;
      in a minimum of 40% of patients after standard PVI, 526 patients will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      study. Enrolment is expected to be completed within 12 months, with all patients followed for&#xD;
      12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demonstrated superiority of an adenosine-guided PVI ablation strategy would represent a major&#xD;
      advancement in refining the interventional approach for AF. The ADVICE trial carries the&#xD;
      potential, therefore, to alter the standard of care and benefit patients with AF by reducing&#xD;
      arrhythmia recurrence, hospitalizations and the need for repeat interventions&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome is time to first recurrence of symptomatic ECG-documented AF or atrial flutter/tachycardia between days 91 &amp; 365 after ablation, or repeat ablation procedure during the first 90 days. AF or atrial flutter/tachycardia will qualify as an arrhythmia recurrence after ablation if it lasts 30 seconds or longer and is documented by 12-lead ECG, surface ECG rhythm strips, or TTM recordings. Documented episodes will be adjudicated by a blinded committee. Time 0 is defined as day 91 post ablation with FUp's extending 365 days post ablation.</description>
