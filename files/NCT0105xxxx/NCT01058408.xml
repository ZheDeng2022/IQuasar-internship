  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RAD001 is approved by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat advanced kidney&#xD;
      cancer. This drug has also been used in other research studies to evaluate its effectiveness&#xD;
      in other cancers. Information from these research studies suggests that RAD001 may help to&#xD;
      decrease the growth and development of tumor cells by reducing the blood supply that tumors&#xD;
      need to grow. In this research study, we are trying to determine the safety of RAD001 when&#xD;
      given to people with locally advanced head and neck cancer in combination with cisplatin and&#xD;
      radiation. We are also looking for the highest dose of RAD001 that can be given to people&#xD;
      safely.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Most patients receiving treatment for head and neck cancer will develop difficulty&#xD;
           swallowing food and drinking liquids during the course of therapy. For this reason, it&#xD;
           will be recommended that a PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) tube be placed in&#xD;
           the participants stomach prior to undergoing the study regimen. This is to help maintain&#xD;
           weight and nutritional health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Since we are looking for highest dose of the study drug that can be administered safely&#xD;
           without severe or unmanageable side effects, not everyone who participates will receive&#xD;
           the same dose of RAD001 or cisplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study regimen will last for seven weeks. During each week of study participation the&#xD;
           following will occur: Radiation will be administered each weekday (5 days per week).&#xD;
           Cisplatin will be given intravenously at the start of each week. RAD001 will be given to&#xD;
           the participant to take at home. Participants will take the study drug once a day in the&#xD;
           morning starting on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A history and physical exam will be performed weekly while participant's are receiving&#xD;
           radiation treatment. Blood tests for routine laboratory testing will be performed&#xD;
           weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each month for the first two months after participants finish radiation therapy and stop&#xD;
           taking RAD001 and cisplatin, they will have a physical ezam, a neurologic exam, and&#xD;
           blood tests. X-rays, a CT, MRI and/or PET scans will also be performed a the two month&#xD;
           visit. After the first two months, follow-up will continue every 1-2 months for the&#xD;
           first year. Additionally, every 6 months for the first two years, follow-up visits will&#xD;
           include an assessment of speech and swallowing functions along with X-rays, CT, MRI&#xD;
           and/or PET scans.&#xD;
