  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of gabapentin on symptom control&#xD;
      in patients with defined functional dyspepsia refractory to conventional proton pump&#xD;
      inhibitor therapy and to compare these effects to that of placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot study we hypothesize that the patients on gabapentin will have an increase in&#xD;
      the adequacy of dyspepsia symptom control at two months as well as improvement in dyspepsia&#xD;
      symptom index scores which are a surrogate of quality of life measures, when compared to&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While functional dyspepsia is divided into four subtypes most studies have grouped all four&#xD;
      as 'functional dyspepsia' and treated them as one. Proton pump inhibition may benefit those&#xD;
      with epigastric pain or burning but typically not those with post-prandial fullness or early&#xD;
      satiety. (Tack et al). Those patients with symptoms refractory to proton pump inhibition&#xD;
      might benefit from a medication that modifies visceral hypersensitivity such as gabapentin.&#xD;
      It is possible that by modifying their pain syndrome we can decrease the need for follow-up&#xD;
      appointments and improve patient quality of life.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients to be included in this study are adults (age &gt;18 years) with defined&#xD;
             functional dyspepsia per the ROME III criteria with a negative EGD who are on proton&#xD;
             pump inhibitor therapy yet still have a sense of inadequate symptom control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients excluded will be women of childbearing age who refuse to have a baseline&#xD;
             pregnancy test and/or who refuse to prevent pregnancy during the trial period.&#xD;
             Exclusion criteria will also include anyone with a history of adverse effect or&#xD;
             allergy to gabapentin. Finally, any patient undergoing hemodialysis or with a history&#xD;
             of creatinine chronically greater than 1.5 will be excluded.&#xD;
