      Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of death from cancer. Because colonic cancer begins as a&#xD;
      small adenoma that , evolves into carcinoma over a decade or more pre-emptive colonoscopic&#xD;
      polypectomy can prevent this malignancy. For a good colonoscopic examination ideally the&#xD;
      colon should be cleansed of all fecal material because poor bowel preparation before&#xD;
      colonoscopy often leads to inability to reach the cecum or poor visualization of the mucosa .&#xD;
      Thus , pathology may be missed, repeat examinations may be scheduled at earlier intervals&#xD;
      than planned and the procedure is more difficult and time consuming. In addition , poor bowel&#xD;
      preparation can increase the risk of significant complications. Perforations resulting from&#xD;
      maneuvers has greater consequences in the setting of inadequate bowel preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past two decades , various bowel preparation methods have been proposed including&#xD;
      castor oil, anthraquinones, phenolphtalein and magnesium citrate, in combination with low&#xD;
      residue diet4-7. Along these agents , cleansing enemas formed the traditional bowel&#xD;
      preparation. Oral sodium phosphate (Fleet Phospo-soda, C.B Fleet Co, Inc., Lynchburg,&#xD;
      Va.)(NaP) a preparation containing dibasic and monobasic sodium phosphate was proven to be&#xD;
      cost effective and has since been used worldwide8,9. NaP osmotically draws plasma water into&#xD;
      the bowel lumen to promote bowel cleansing. NaP must be accompanied by significant oral fluid&#xD;
      to prevent dehydration. Patients with compromised renal function, dehydration, hypercalcemia&#xD;
      or hypertension with the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have experienced&#xD;
      phosphate nephropathy after use of oral NaP solutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Senna laxatives containing sennosides activated by colonic bacteria have a direct effect on&#xD;
      intestinal mucosa increasing the rate of colonic motility , enhancing colonic transit, and&#xD;
      inhibiting water and electrolyte secretion10. Sennosides may result in hypokalemia and atonic&#xD;
      colon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to assess the bowel cleansing effects of two different agents and to&#xD;
      compare their safety of application, ease of usage and effects on serum electrolytes.&#xD;
