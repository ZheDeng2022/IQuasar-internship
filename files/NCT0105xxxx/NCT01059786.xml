      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers are attempting to develop new treatments for hairy cell leukemia (HCL) that&#xD;
           has not responded well to or has recurred after standard HCL therapies. One nonstandard&#xD;
           treatment for HCL is rituximab, an antibody that binds to the cancer cells and helps the&#xD;
           immune system destroy them. By combining rituximab with other anti-cancer drugs,&#xD;
           researchers hope to determine whether the combined drugs are successful in treating HCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pentostatin and bendamustine are two anti-cancer drugs that have been used to treat&#xD;
           different kinds of blood and immune system cancers. Bendamustine is approved to treat&#xD;
           other kinds of leukemia and lymphoma, but it has not been used to treat HCL. Pentostatin&#xD;
           has been used for more than 20 years to treat HCL, but it has not been combined with&#xD;
           rituximab in official clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether rituximab with either pentostatin or bendamustine is a more&#xD;
           effective treatment for HCL than rituximab alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether pentostatin or bendamustine is a more effective treatment for HCL&#xD;
           when combined with rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with hairy cell leukemia that&#xD;
      has not responded well to or has relapsed after standard HCL therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will last for four treatment cycles of 28 days each.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior to the study, participants will be screened with a full medical history and&#xD;
           physical exam, bone marrow biopsy (if one has not been performed in the last 6 months),&#xD;
           computed tomography (CT) or ultrasound scan, tumor measurements, and other tests as&#xD;
           required by the researchers. Participants will provide blood and urine samples at this&#xD;
           time as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rituximab with bendamustine: Participants will receive rituximab on Days 1 and 15 of&#xD;
           each cycle and bendamustine on Days 1 and 2 of each cycle, for a total of four cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rituximab with pentostatin: Participants will receive rituximab on Days 1 and 15 of each&#xD;
           cycle and pentostatin on rituximab on Days 1 and 15 of each cycle, for a total of four&#xD;
           cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have regular tests during the treatment cycles, including bone marrow&#xD;
           biopsies and CT or ultrasound scans. Participants will also provide regular blood and&#xD;
           urine samples to assess the results of treatment.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is highly responsive to purine analogs cladribine and&#xD;
           pentostatin, without evidence of cure. Neither is standard after 2 courses, due to&#xD;
           cumulative marrow and T-cell toxicity and declining remission rates and durations. Once&#xD;
           resistant, patients after multiple relapses can die of disease-related cytopenias.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rituximab alone in 51 patients from 5 trials who had cytopenias and at least 1 prior&#xD;
           purine analog resulted in 10 complete + 10 partial remissions (CR+PR= ORR 39%).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rituximab with cladribine gives high CR rates in 1st or 2nd line, but is not standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  While cladribine use is more common for 1st and 2nd line, pentostatin is often used for&#xD;
           subsequent treatment because of &lt; 100% cross-resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Retrospective published data for pentostatin plus rituximab in HCL include 7 of 7&#xD;
           responses with 6 (86%) CRs, and there are no prospective data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recombinant immunotoxins targeting CD25 (LMB-2) and CD22 (BL22 and HA22) are highly&#xD;
           active in purine analog resistant HCL. Palliative pentostatin-rituximab is often used&#xD;
           off-protocol for patients with immunogenicity needing more therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bendamustine is approved for early treatment of CLL, and is effective with rituximab for&#xD;
           relapsed/refractory CLL. Its use in HCL is unreported.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CRs with minimal residual disease (MRD) by immunohistochemistry of bone marrow biopsy&#xD;
           (BMBx IHC), can relapse early. Tests for HCL MRD in blood or marrow include flow&#xD;
           cytometry (FACS) or PCR using consensus primers. The most sensitive MRD test in HCL is&#xD;
           real-time quantitative PCR using sequence-specific primers (RQ-PCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Of 5 HCL-specific trials listed on Cancer.gov, 2 are phase II trials of cladribine +&#xD;
           rituximab in 1st and 2nd line (1 randomized at NIH, 1 non-randomized at MDA), and 3 NIH&#xD;
           phase I-II trials of recombinant immunotoxins BL22, HA22 and LMB-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      --To determine if pentostatin + rituximab and bendamustine + rituximab are each associated&#xD;
      with adequate response rates (ORR=PR+CR) in patients with relapsed HCL, and, if so, to select&#xD;
      which combination is likely to be superior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HCL needing therapy, either greater than or equal to 2 prior courses of purine analog, 1&#xD;
           course purine analog plus greater than or equal to 1 course rituximab if &lt; 1 year&#xD;
           response to the 1 course purine analog, diagnosis of HCL variant (HCLv), or unmutated&#xD;
           IGHV4-34+expressing HCL/HCLv.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior treatment, ineligibility for, or patient refusal of recombinant immunotoxin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rituximab 375 mg/m^2 on day 1, 15 for 6 x 28-day cycles (all 72 patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initial tolerability study: 12 patients receive rituximab + bendamustine (nonrandom),&#xD;
           including 6 at 70 mg/m^2 and 6 at 90 mg/m^2 of bendamustine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomize: 1) 28 patients to bendamustine 90 mg/m2/day, days 1 and 2 each cycle 2) 28&#xD;
           patients to pentostatin 4 mg/m2 days 1 and 15 of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-randomize: up to 4 patients to receive either bendamustine 90 mg/m^2P2P/day, days 1&#xD;
           and 2 each cycle or pentostatin 4 mg/m^2P2P days 1 and 15 of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistics: If &gt; 14/28 respond, can conclude with 90% power that response &gt; 40% in that&#xD;
           arm. &gt;80% probability of selecting the better arm if true response probability is&#xD;
           approximately 40-50% on the inferior arm and &gt;15% higher on the superior arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stratify to equalize the % of patients/arm refractory to last course of purine analog.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Accrual Ceiling: 74&#xD;

             and rubella (MMR); and hepatitis B. Patients who are considered to be at high risk for&#xD;
             hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and for whom the investigator has determined that&#xD;
             immunization is indicated should complete the entire HBV vaccine series at least 4&#xD;
