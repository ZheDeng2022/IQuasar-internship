  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year around 200 blood donors in the UK are found to be infected with blood-borne&#xD;
      diseases (HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HTLV), while several others have been identified&#xD;
      as having an increased risk of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD). Although the&#xD;
      notification procedures for these infections vary, their effectiveness and appropriateness&#xD;
      have never been evaluated in a systematic study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research has been designed to assess the responses of blood donors to&#xD;
      notification and their satisfaction with how they were informed about the infection. The&#xD;
      study will be implemented using standard questionnaire-based measures (French et al, 2004;&#xD;
      Marteau &amp; Bekker, 1992).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve approximately 600 blood donors who were informed of an infection or&#xD;
      possible infection with blood-borne diseases in 2008 and 2009, and approximately 100 donors&#xD;
      notified of possible risk of vCJD infection in 2005. A comparable group of 2005 donors will&#xD;
      be included to control for the effects of time. As the majority of donors testing positive&#xD;
      donated to NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT), the participants will be identified from the&#xD;
      NHSBT database only, and their availability confirmed through their GP or specialist&#xD;
      clinician. A standardized questionnaire will be then sent to all those identified as&#xD;
      eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last 12 months, but direct participant involvement will be limited to the time&#xD;
      required to complete the questionnaire, which should take under one hour. To safeguard&#xD;
      confidentiality, no identifiable personal data will be used in the analysis. Where&#xD;
      demographic or medical information already held by NHSBT is retrieved to minimise response&#xD;
      burden, this will be pseudonymised before use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is sponsored by the blood services for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern&#xD;
      Ireland. The results will be used to inform notification procedures in the future.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the impact of notification of blood donors testing&#xD;
      positive for microbiology markers for blood-borne and (mostly) currently incurable infections&#xD;
      (hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV, HTLV and vCJD). Specifically, the study will focus on donors'&#xD;
      responses to being notified of an infection or possible infection, and their satisfaction&#xD;
      with the notification process. The data collected will be used to examine predictors of&#xD;
      satisfaction and thus help inform notification procedures in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the UK, all donations are unpaid and voluntary, which is considered to be the safest&#xD;
      method of blood collection (WHO Global Database on Blood Safety (GDBS) and Blood Safety&#xD;
      Indicators). Out of the 1.9 million UK blood donations in 2008, only 187 (&gt;0.01%) tested&#xD;
      positive. With such low incidence and focus on blood safety, the deferred donor management is&#xD;
      largely informed by anecdotal evidence and historical developments. The notification process&#xD;
      is standardised within each blood service (e.g. NHSBT Management of Donors with Confirmed&#xD;
      Positive Microbiological Markers, MPD/MED/009/05), but has never been evaluated in a&#xD;
      systematic study. Worldwide, only a handful of studies have approached the issue (Tynell et&#xD;
      al, 2007; Kleinman et al, 2004), but have suggested that donors can experience confusion and&#xD;
      anxiety as a result of notification. It is therefore possible that current notification&#xD;
      procedures do not adequately address the donors' needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent in-depth qualitative study of the impact of notification of possible increased risk&#xD;
      of variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (vCJD) for public health purposes (Elam et al, awaiting&#xD;
      publication) found that notification was a shocking event in most subjects' lives, although&#xD;
      it did not have a lasting emotional impact. Several factors influenced how well information&#xD;
      given at notification was retained and implemented. As it is anticipated that all blood&#xD;
      donations are to be screened for vCJD as soon as a test becomes available, the need for the&#xD;
      development of optimal notification procedures was identified. The proposed study builds on&#xD;
      those findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood donors comprise a unique population, usually characterised by high altruism, low&#xD;
      risk-taking, conservatism and concern with health (Simmons et al., 1993; Burnett, 1981). For&#xD;
      those reasons, notification of serious infection could cause them greater distress,&#xD;
      experience of stigma and self-image damage than an average person (Jackson, 2005; Orsini,&#xD;
      2002; Schulte, 2002; Murray, 1990), and therefore should be handled with utmost care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, blood donations in the UK are routinely tested for syphilis, hepatitis B virus&#xD;
      (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and human T-lymphotropic&#xD;
      virus (HTLV). Additionally, if indicated by donor history, supplementary tests for malaria,&#xD;
      T-cruzi, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and West Nile virus (WNV) are performed. For the purposes of&#xD;
      the study, only donors notified of positive test results of routine screening will be&#xD;
      surveyed. Those testing positive for syphilis will not be included because of the universally&#xD;
      curable nature of the infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mail out questionnaire was chosen as the best form of data collection because of the&#xD;
      significant dispersion of the study population, the continuity of contact method, and the low&#xD;
      intrusiveness of the instrument. Those wishing to participate will be able to complete the&#xD;
      questionnaire at a time and place most convenient to them. As initial communication was by&#xD;
      letter, it is expected that a mail out survey accompanied by a cover letter will be&#xD;
      accessible to most donors. A telephone- and a web-based survey completion option will also be&#xD;
      offered to facilitate access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire will focus on three main areas of interest, namely satisfaction, emotional&#xD;
      response and understanding. These were identified from the in-depth vCJD study, donor records&#xD;
      and literature review as the issues most pertinent to the notification process, and ones&#xD;
      influenced by the manner in which information is provided. Personal characteristics and&#xD;
      circumstances will not be considered, as they are already well researched from the&#xD;
      perspective of coping (Kaye &amp; Raghavan, 2002; Baile et al., 2000; Kraus et al., 2000; Buckman&#xD;
      &amp; Kason, 1992), and not controlled for in blood donation, thus limiting their usefulness for&#xD;
      informing donor notification process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure the appropriateness and feasibility of questions, and to avoid misrepresentation,&#xD;
      the survey will be piloted with a small sample of donors testing positive in routine&#xD;
      screening in 2007.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The return of a completed questionnaire will be treated as implied consent, and the return of&#xD;
      an empty one with or without the opt-out option selected will be taken to signify the donor's&#xD;
      decision not to give such consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main risk identified in contacting positive donors is re-traumatisation, and a helpline&#xD;
      number will be provided to allow those experiencing any distress to discuss their situation.&#xD;
      It is hoped, however, that as the infections under study are chronic, re-traumatisation would&#xD;
      be rare and minimal. It is further hoped that the character of the project, which aims to aid&#xD;
      the development of notification procedures that would be the most satisfactory to donors&#xD;
      receiving positive test results in the future, would be welcome by most subjects as an&#xD;
      opportunity to engage in an activity that could be of benefit to others. Should any donor's&#xD;
      reaction suggest that their situation may be serious, every attempt will be made to offer&#xD;
      follow-up care. Any aggravating issues inherent in the questionnaire itself, however, will&#xD;
      hopefully be identified and rectified at the piloting stage. The direct donor burden, should&#xD;
      they choose to participate in the study, should be limited to the 20-30 minutes needed to&#xD;
      complete the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only the Principal Investigator and the researcher will have access to identifiable personal&#xD;
      data, the PI as a member of the donor's healthcare team, and the researcher within the remit&#xD;
      of the position. The researcher's access to and use of donor records will comply with the&#xD;
      Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and further with the NHS Confidentiality Code of Practice.&#xD;
      Donor name and number will be coded and stored separately from the pseudonymised survey data.&#xD;
      The file linking donor identifiable information with codes will be stored for the duration of&#xD;
      the research project only. The raw survey data file and returned questionnaires will be&#xD;
      stored securely for a minimum of 2 years. Only the pseudonymised data will be used for&#xD;
      analysis, and no identifiable donor information will be included in ensuing reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The demographic data such as age, ethnicity and sex already available in the donor records&#xD;
      will be pseudonymised and used to reduce response burden. Only the data theoretically&#xD;
      relevant to the study will be included. The access to all study files will be restricted, and&#xD;
      all information will be stored and shared securely as per NHS guidelines. No identifiable&#xD;
      personal data will be shared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey data will be statistically analysed using SPSS. Every attempt will be made to&#xD;
      assess the extent of the non-response error using pseudonymised demographic data of the&#xD;
      non-respondents. Due to the large number of variables involved, main attention will be given&#xD;
      to descriptive statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To avoid misinterpretation, any conclusions drawn from the data will be discussed by the&#xD;
      Project Management Group and not made by the researcher in isolation. The results of the&#xD;
      study will be published and accessible to the participants and general public in this way, or&#xD;
      if requested directly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the PI and the researcher are the employees of the NHSBT. The proposed research project&#xD;
      is funded by the four UK blood services, and aims to improve the service offered. It will&#xD;
      consider all responses, and use them to the benefit of the service users; however, it is&#xD;
      intended to investigate the responses of blood donors who have donated in England or North&#xD;
      Wales only. Due to the unique characteristics of this group, without further study the&#xD;
      results cannot be generalised to the entire UK population or to other countries.&#xD;
