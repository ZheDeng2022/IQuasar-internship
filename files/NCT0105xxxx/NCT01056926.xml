    <textblock>
      In the present study the investigators will measure the effects of nicotine and non-nicotine&#xD;
      factors on brain function during cognitive processes that are differentially sensitive to&#xD;
      these factors. One process-continuous working memory (CWM)-is implemented via a network of&#xD;
      frontal and parietal brain regions and is highly dopamine dependent. Smoking cessation&#xD;
      results in significant deficits in CWM which can persist for weeks and are reversed by&#xD;
      resumption of nicotine administration in the form of smoking or nicotine replacement.&#xD;
      Additionally, CWM deficits are observed during smoking of denic cigarettes. Brain function&#xD;
      during CWM is modulated by smoking abstinence and subsequent nicotine administration and&#xD;
      activity in the dlPFC is implicated in these effects. Collectively, these data suggest that&#xD;
      CWM is highly sensitive to the nicotine, but not non-nicotine components of smoking. Brain&#xD;
      function during CWM is altered by smoking abstinence and nicotine, but the effect of smoking,&#xD;
      in the absence of nicotine, has not been evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another process-cue-reactivity (CR)-results from the repeated pairing of otherwise neutral&#xD;
      stimuli with nicotine administration. Acute smoking cessation has not been shown to have&#xD;
      strong effects on CR in the form of cue-provoked craving, nor has nicotine replacement been&#xD;
      shown to have robust effects on CR. Likewise, the direct effects of smoking abstinence on&#xD;
      brain CR have been small; though craving has been shown to modulate relations between&#xD;
      abstinence and CR. Moreover, recent data from our lab suggest larger 'doses' of abstinence (~&#xD;
      24 hrs) may amplify brain responses to cues. The effect of smoking in the absence of&#xD;
      nicotine, on CR has not, to our knowledge, been evaluated. Collectively, these data suggest&#xD;
      that CR in the form of cue-induced craving is not highly sensitive to the effects of&#xD;
      short-term smoking abstinence or nicotine. Brain CR is modulated by abstinence-induced&#xD;
      craving and longer-term abstinence, but it is unclear whether abstinence from nicotine or&#xD;
      non-nicotine components is responsible for these effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, we propose to evaluate the effects of non-nicotine and nicotine factors&#xD;
      on CWM and CR using functional magnetic resonance imaging. This method allows for the&#xD;
      non-invasive assessment of brain function. We will also examine the role of genes in&#xD;
      moderating and mediating the effects of nicotine and non-nicotine factors on cognitive&#xD;
      function&#xD;

      Overview. In a fully factorial design, thirty-six (n=36) adult smokers will undergo fMRI&#xD;
      scanning at least 24 hours after each of the following conditions: 1) Nicotine Patch + Denic&#xD;
      Smoking, 2) Placebo Patch + Denic Smoking, 3) Nicotine Patch + No Smoking, and 4) Placebo&#xD;
      Patch+ No Smoking. During scanning, participants will complete a laboratory based measure of&#xD;
      continuous working memory (n-back)-a measure of continuous working memory-and the&#xD;
      cue-reactivity task (CR)-a measure of responses to smoking cues. Broadly, we hypothesize 1)&#xD;
      abstinence from nicotine, regardless of smoking, will disrupt CWM performance and brain&#xD;
      function, 2) abstinence from nicotine and denics will potentiate brain CR but differentially&#xD;
      contribute to this effect and 3) that individual differences in smoking behavior and&#xD;
      motivation will predict the effects of nicotine and non-nicotine factors on brain function.&#xD;
