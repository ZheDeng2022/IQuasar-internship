  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the effects of MDMA on sleep, mood, thinking, and how&#xD;
      your body retains water. The researchers are interested in the effects that occur a few hours&#xD;
      after taking MDMA as well as effects occurring over the next two days. We will study these&#xD;
      effects in a standardized, controlled setting at the Clinical and Translational Science&#xD;
      Institute (CTSI) Clinical Research Center (CRC) located at San Francisco General Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. MDMA will induce sleep disruption, as indicated by comprehensive polysomnography, wrist&#xD;
           actigraphy, and self-report sleep measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. MDMA will alter sodium and water homeostasis by either increasing or blunting the&#xD;
           suppression of arginine vasopressin levels and decreasing free water excretion. Effects&#xD;
           will be exacerbated by water loading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Acutely, MDMA will increase both positive and negative arousal, and to increase&#xD;
           sociability but not autonomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Acutely, MDMA will increase risk-taking and willingness to donate money to others in an&#xD;
           economic decision making task.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. MDMA will decrease the stressful effects of talking about a negatively-valenced&#xD;
           autobiographical but will increase recall for details for these episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. MDMA will increase oxidative stress markers and possible ameliorating factors (e.g.,&#xD;
           ADMA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The short form of the serotonin transported promoter region will be associated with&#xD;
           greater acute and discontinuation effects of MDMA.&#xD;

      This is a placebo-controlled, double-blind, gender balanced, within-subject study on the&#xD;
      acute and 24 to 48 hour post dose effects (discontinuation syndrome) of MDMA on sleep&#xD;
      architecture, water homeostasis and neurocognitive function. We will define the signs and&#xD;
      symptoms of sleep disruption and time course of alterations in ADH levels and neurocognitive&#xD;
      function occurring after administration of a single dose of MDMA in experienced users. The&#xD;
      immediate effects of MDMA include euphoria and intoxication; at 24 hours after MDMA these&#xD;
      positive effects are replaced by lowered mood and lethargy - we refer to these effects as a&#xD;
      discontinuation syndrome. The pleasurable effects of MDMA are thought to be due to elevations&#xD;
      of serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine; the mechanisms of post-MDMA depression are unknown&#xD;
      but may be due to relative serotonin depletion. Among its many functions serotonin maintains&#xD;
      normal sleep architecture. The effects of MDMA discontinuation on sleep architecture will be&#xD;
      assessed using comprehensive polysomnography and wrist actigraphy with measures obtained ~36&#xD;
      hours after a single dose of MDMA. Cognitive measurements will explore the acute effects of&#xD;
      MDMA. MDMA can produce hyponatremia. In this study we will evaluate the effects of MDMA on&#xD;
      ADH release, urine sodium excretion, and the relationship of gender to these effects.&#xD;
