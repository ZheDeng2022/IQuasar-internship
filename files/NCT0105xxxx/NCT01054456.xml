  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of palonesetron in preventing&#xD;
      chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) when administered to participants who have&#xD;
      experienced either vomiting and or at least moderate nausea during their last cycle of low&#xD;
      emetogenic chemotherapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Palonosetron is currently approved for prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting&#xD;
      associated with initial and repeat CINV caused by moderate and highly emetogenic&#xD;
      chemotherapy. This study is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of palonesetron in&#xD;
      preventing CINV when administered to patients who have experienced either vomiting and or at&#xD;
      least moderate nausea during their last cycle of low emetogenic chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Palonosetron will be given intravenously approximately 30 minutes prior to the start of the&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen. Efficacy and safety including episodes of nausea, retching and or&#xD;
      vomiting will be assessed over five 24 hour periods starting on Day 1 and ending on Day 6 in&#xD;
      patient diaries. On Day 2 and Day 6 a FLIE (Functional Living Index- Emesis) assessment will&#xD;
      also be completed in order to help evaluate the patient's quality of life from the start of&#xD;
      the chemotherapy cycle through Day 6.&#xD;

    <time_frame>From (Day 2-5) to the End of Study (Day 8)</time_frame>
    <description>FLIE is a patient-completed quality of life assessment modified from the original Functional Living Index - Cancer questionnaire. FLIE contains two domains: nausea and vomiting with nine items in each domain. The first item asks the patient to rate how much nausea (or vomiting) has occurred over a 5 day period. The remaining eight items ask patients to rate the impact of nausea (or vomiting) on various aspects of a patient's life (for example, ability to enjoy meals/liquids). Each item is answered using a 7 point visual analog scale with 7 being &quot;none /not at all&quot; and 1 being &quot;a great deal&quot;. The two domains are summed for a total score with a possible range of 18-126. Higher scores indicate a more favorable quality of life. A total score of &gt;108 defines those patients who had a minimal impact of Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV) on quality of life.</description>

An emetic episode was defined as 1) one occurrence of vomiting, or 2) a sequence of occurrences in very close succession not relieved by a period of relaxation of at least 1 minute, any number of occurrences of unproductive emesis (retches) in a unique 5-minute period, or 3) an episode of retching of less than 5 minute duration combined with vomiting not relieved by a period of relaxation of at least 1 minute. Participants who completed the diary for a given period and had no emetic episodes and no use of rescue medication were considered to have achieved CR, during the period.</description>

        <description>CR was defined as the participants without any emetic episodes and did not use any rescue medication during overall period (0-120 hours). An emetic episode was defined as 1) one occurrence of vomiting, or 2) a sequence of occurrences in very close succession not relieved by a period of relaxation of at least 1 minute, any number of occurrences of unproductive emesis (retches) in a unique 5-minute period, or 3) an episode of retching of less than 5 minute duration combined with vomiting not relieved by a period of relaxation of at least 1 minute. Participants who completed the diary for a given period and had no emetic episodes and no use of rescue medication were considered to have achieved CR, during the period.</description>

        <description>Complete Control was defined as the percentage of participants who had a CR and no more than mild nausea. CR was defined as the participants without any emetic episodes and did not use any rescue medication. An emetic episode was defined as 1) one occurrence of vomiting, or 2) a sequence of occurrences in very close succession not relieved by a period of relaxation of at least 1 minute, any number of occurrences of unproductive emesis (retches) in a unique 5-minute period, or 3) an episode of retching of less than 5 minute duration combined with vomiting not relieved by a period of relaxation of at least 1 minute. Participants who completed the diary for a given period and had no emetic episod es and no use of rescue medication were considered to have CR during the period. Those same participants were considered complete control for the period if they had no more than mild nausea during the period.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Follow Up Period (Day 2-5) in Scores on Functional Living Index-Emesis [FLIE] Assessment Questionnaires to the End of Study (Day 8)</title>
        <description>FLIE is a patient-completed quality of life assessment modified from the original Functional Living Index - Cancer questionnaire. FLIE contains two domains: nausea and vomiting with nine items in each domain. The first item asks the patient to rate how much nausea (or vomiting) has occurred over a 5 day period. The remaining eight items ask patients to rate the impact of nausea (or vomiting) on various aspects of a patient's life (for example, ability to enjoy meals/liquids). Each item is answered using a 7 point visual analog scale with 7 being &quot;none /not at all&quot; and 1 being &quot;a great deal&quot;. The two domains are summed for a total score with a possible range of 18-126. Higher scores indicate a more favorable quality of life. A total score of &gt;108 defines those patients who had a minimal impact of Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV) on quality of life.</description>
