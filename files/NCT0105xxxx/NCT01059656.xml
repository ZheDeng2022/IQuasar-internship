      In relation to the activation of PDGF-mediated signalization due to the fusion gene&#xD;
      COL1A1-PDGFb in DFSP, imatinib (800mg/day) has shown activity in advanced DFSP and has became&#xD;
      the reference treatment option for these patients. Yet the activity observed does not allow&#xD;
      for a downstaging compatible with successful resection in a number of patients and does not&#xD;
      prevent subsequent tumour progression in case of residual tumour.Pazopanib in relation to 1)&#xD;
      its multi tyrosine kinase inhibiting activity (VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, PDGFR-α, PDGFR-β&#xD;
      and c-kit with IC50 values of 10, 30, 47, 71, 84, and 74 nM, respectively) involving in&#xD;
      particular PDGFR, and VEGFR which has been shown to be activated in DFSP, 2) its antitumour&#xD;
      activity in sarcomas patients, and 3) its acceptable safety profile, is a logical candidate&#xD;
      for therapeutic trials in DFSP both in patients not expected to derive a sufficient benefit&#xD;
      from imatinib and in patients failing imatinib mesylate. Moreover, using quantitative RT-PCR&#xD;
      and immunohistochemistry we have recently demonstrated high levels of VEGF and VEGFR2&#xD;
      expression in dermatofibrosarcoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberance (DFSP) is a rare soft tissue sarcoma of intermediate&#xD;
      malignant potential. Treatment relies on a wide local excision with negative margin and with&#xD;
      frequent need of reconstructive surgery. A translocation between chromosomes 17 and 22 that&#xD;
      places the platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGFB) under the control of the collagen 1A1&#xD;
      promoter is present in &gt; 90 % of the cases leading to an up regulation of PDGF-β expression&#xD;
      and activation of the tyrosinase kinase PDGFRβ. Imatinib mesylate has been approved in&#xD;
      unresectable and metastatic DFSP due to its activity on PDGFR. This study will evaluate the&#xD;
      benefit of pazopanib, a multikinase inhibitor in advanced DFSP. Administration of pazopanib&#xD;
      per os 800mg/ qd during 6 months until stable response according to primary endpoint , and&#xD;
      for a period of study not exceeding one year.In case of progression evaluated according to&#xD;
      the primary endpoint after a period of treatment superior to one month, or in the absence of&#xD;
      response at 3 months, the patient will be withdrawn from study, in order to get alternative&#xD;
      therapeutics. These patients will be considered as failures for analysis. After a 6-month&#xD;
      treatment period, and reaching a stable response, treatment continuation decision will be&#xD;
      based on the operability of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of pazopanib per os 800mg/ qd during 6 months until stable response according&#xD;
      to primary endpoint, with 3 monthly successive examinations, and for a period of study not&#xD;
      exceeding 18 months.In case of progression evaluated according to the primary endpoint after&#xD;
      a period of treatment superior to one month, or in the absence of response at 3 months, the&#xD;
      patient will be withdrawn from study, in order to get alternative therapeutics. These&#xD;
      patients will be considered as failures for analysis. After a 6-month treatment period, and&#xD;
      reaching a stable response, treatment continuation decision will be based on the operability&#xD;
      of patients Statistical analysis : The trial has been planned using a one-stage design&#xD;
      (Fleming TR. Et al) Analysis of the main endpoint will rely on a one-sided binomial test&#xD;
      comparing the observed response rate to the expected response rate under the null hypothesis&#xD;
      . The type I error rate is fixed at 0.025.For the main endpoint, a point estimate and a&#xD;
      two-sided 90% confidence interval will be presented, which will be consistent with the&#xD;
      one-sided test at a 0.025 level. For secondary endpoints, point estimates and 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals will be presented.We intend to estimate the probability of tumour size reduction of&#xD;
      at least 30%. The sample size was calculated by FLEMMING method : Ho will be defined by a RR&#xD;
      ≤20% (decrease in tumour size of at least 30%) , H1 , response rate, 26 patients must be&#xD;
      included in order to demonstrate an efficacy as defined by a RR≥50%, with a 90% power and&#xD;
      alfa 2.5% one side.&#xD;
