    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer is common in some areas , ranking as the fourth leading cause of death from&#xD;
      cancer in China and sixth worldwide. Although the prognosis of surgical resection for&#xD;
      esophageal cancer has been improved, more than 50% of such patients are inoperable and have&#xD;
      to undergo palliative treatments because of late stage cancer or metastasis. Dysphagia is the&#xD;
      predominate symptom of patients with inoperable esophageal cancer. To relieve the dysphagia&#xD;
      and improve the quality of life of such patients, brachytherapy has previously been utilized.&#xD;
      Recently, stent placement has been widely accepted to be an option for palliation of the&#xD;
      symptoms due to the esophageal strictures. Brachytherapy and esophageal self-expanding stent&#xD;
      insertion have longer benefit. Stent insertion provides fastest improvement of&#xD;
      dysphagia.However, recurrence of the neoplastic stricture remains a challenge after stent&#xD;
      placement, complications in later setting occur and require further endoscopic treatment.&#xD;
      Brachytherapy has slower onset of benefit but has fewer complications and longer benefit.To&#xD;
      combine the advantages of the immediate relief of the esophageal dysphagia with the stent&#xD;
      placement and radiation therapy with brachytherapy, a novel esophageal stent loaded with 125I&#xD;
      seeds has been developed in the authors' institute. The technical feasibility and safety with&#xD;
      this new stent has been demonstrated to be adequate in a healthy rabbit model. And a&#xD;
      small-sample and unicentric prior clinical trial in the authors' institute certificated the&#xD;
      novel esophageal stent can relieve the dysphagia caused by advanced esophageal cancer rapidly&#xD;
      and improve the quality of life markedly. This current multicentric randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      is further studying the novel esophageal stent loaded with 125I seeds to see how well they&#xD;
      work compared with a conventional covered stent in patients with malignant dysphagia caused&#xD;
      by advanced esophageal cancer.&#xD;

      PURPOSE Rationale: Placing a stent in the esophagus may relieve the dysphagia caused by&#xD;
      inoperable esophageal cancer rapidly and improve the quality of life . But recurrence of the&#xD;
      neoplastic stricture remains a challenge after solitary stent placement. Brachytherapy is an&#xD;
      option for palliation of the symptoms due to the esophageal strictures,however,it can not&#xD;
      relieve the dysphagia rapidly. So a novel esophageal stent loaded with 125I seeds combines&#xD;
      the advantages of the immediate relief of the esophageal dysphagia with the stent placement&#xD;
      and radiation therapy with brachytherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: A small-sample and unicentric clinical trial in the authors' institute had&#xD;
      certificated that a novel esophageal stent loaded with 125I seeds for intraluminal&#xD;
      brachytherapy can relieve the dysphagia caused by advanced esophageal cancer rapidly and&#xD;
      improve the quality of life . This multicentric randomized clinical trial is further studying&#xD;
      the novel esophageal stent loaded with 125I seeds to see how well they work compared with a&#xD;
      conventional covered stent in patients with malignant dysphagia caused by advanced esophageal&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;

           day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: Patients undergo placement of a conventional covered stent on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health-related quality of life is assessed at baseline, I, 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Condition :Esophageal Cancer Intervention (Procedure): Esophageal stent placement,dysphagia&#xD;

&#xD;
      Case exfoliation :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition:any participant who has signed and entered the trial do not insist to the end.The&#xD;
      reasons may be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participant do not cooperate with the designed tests or receive other therapies&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Inquest the reason and supply the date by telephone and follow-up visiting,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Corresponding methods should be adapted to handle the adverse reactions,adverse events&#xD;
           or complications,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Store the primitive date of exfoliated participants for full analysis&#xD;
           set（FAS）statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case rejection:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Misdiagnosis and wrong enrollment,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consistent with exclusion criteria,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No any test record,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Can not evaluate the efficacy for receiving other therapies without the permission, Any&#xD;
           rejected case should be supplied with the reason and quit the curative effect&#xD;
           statistical analysis.However, the record of those who have been treated for at least one&#xD;
           time should be included into the adverse reactions analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multicentre: all patients come from sixteen hospitals disseminated in China,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completely randomized：Number are completely randomized formed depending on the SAS&#xD;
           statistics software and are administered by the sponsor,every collaborator apply for the&#xD;
           number once a participant enrolled and choose the treatment arm according to the random&#xD;
           number.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single Blind:the participants is unaware which treatment will to be took&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active Control: there are treatment arms. Arm I: patients undergo placement of a novel&#xD;
           esophageal stent loaded with 125I seeds. Arm II: patients undergo placement of a&#xD;
           conventional covered stent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample estimation:It has been demonstrated in the preclinical trial that the median&#xD;
           survival time of the advanced esophageal cancer patients with self-expandable esophageal&#xD;
           radiation stent insertion is about 7 m, while those with conventional covered stent&#xD;
           insertion is about 4 m. Considering the enrollment time of 3 m(T1 is 0.25y),whole trial&#xD;
           time of 1.5y.and α is 0.05 (test of two-sided) or 0.10(test of one-sided），the least&#xD;
           sample number is 152.If the exfoliated cases are considered, the least sample number is&#xD;
           186 (increasing about 20 percent).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case diffusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Be sent to one of two arms according to the random number randomized formed by the SAS&#xD;
      statistics software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation dose estimation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After balloon dilation ( the special balloon producted for esophageal dilation by Nanjing&#xD;
      MicroInvasive Medical,Nanjing,China) in participants[the balloon diameter is 16mm in superior&#xD;
      segment of esophagus and 18mm in the midpiece and inferior segment of esophagus],CT scan of&#xD;
      the esophagus with the balloon in is performed.Then the images will be send to the Treatment&#xD;
      Planning System(TPS, Nanjing MicroInvasive Medical,Nanjing,China),and the bulk of the&#xD;
      oesophageal cancer will be calculated according to the CT three-dimensional reconstruction&#xD;
      images.At last,the radiation dose will be estimated(with radioactivity 0.7mCi according to&#xD;
      the preclinical study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Choice of stent and seeds fixation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The esophageal irradiation stent combined a self-expandable covered esophageal&#xD;
      stent(MTN;Nanjing MicroInvasive Medical,Nanjing,China) loaded (or not loaded) with 125I&#xD;
      radiative seeds(CIAE-6711;Chinese Atomic Energy Science Institution,Beijing,China) are&#xD;
      chose.The diameter varies from 16 to 18mm(16mm in superior segment of esophagus and 18mm in&#xD;
      the midpiece and inferior segment of esophagus), the length is the length of disease with&#xD;
      additional 20mm. The seeds (number is decided according to the radiation dose estimated in&#xD;
      advance)are fixed around the stent,covering the superior and inferior border of the cancer&#xD;
      (the distance of seeds varies from 10mm to 15mm and the distance of seeds and inlet/outlet&#xD;
      less than10mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operation Care Participants lie on the back with waist raised after stent insertion,&#xD;
      common treatments include hemostasis, infection prevention, mucous membrane of esophagus and&#xD;
      stomach protection.No cold diet,except eating fluid slowly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calling or visiting the patients every month after test insertion.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All primal date should be stored completely and precisely and submitted to the special date&#xD;
      administrator in time by the Internet.Before entering the date into the special database by&#xD;
      two people independent, all submitted data must be reviewed, verified to ensure the accuracy,&#xD;
      currency(according to the primal date).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis software of SAS 9.0 is adapted. Test of two-sided, if P ≤0.05,there are&#xD;
      significant difference. Mean, standard deviation(SD),median, maximum and minimum value are&#xD;
      used to describe the measurement data of two groups;the rank sum test is used to valuate the&#xD;
      relief of dysphagia;log-rank test is used to compare the survival curves of two groups which&#xD;
      have been drawn with the Kaplan-meier method.At last the median survivals will be obtained&#xD;
      and compared by t test and rank sum test .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Constituent ratio is used to describe the numeration data of two groups; u test is used to&#xD;
      valuate the difference of survival rates;and the reasons of restenosis are analysed with&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test or chi-square(X2) test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The balance-analyses of fundament data(population data and others): t test or chi-square(X2)&#xD;
      test is chose.&#xD;
