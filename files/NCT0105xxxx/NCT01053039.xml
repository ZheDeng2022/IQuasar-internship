  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to assess the impact of intrathecal morphine on&#xD;
      post-operative pain following instrumented fusion for degenerative lumbar spine disease.&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of this study aim to assess side effects, overall narcotic use and&#xD;
      duration of hospital stay following administration of intrathecal morphine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on our literature review, we expect a significant improvement in pain scores and&#xD;
      functional status and minimal side effects with the use of intrathecal morphine. With&#xD;
      improved pain and function we would also expect shorter hospital stays in those patients&#xD;
      receiving intrathecal morphine.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Adult patients (&gt;18 yrs or older) undergoing instrumented fusion for degenerative lumbar&#xD;
      spine disease will be recruited and randomized to receive one of two treatments. The first&#xD;
      group will receive an injection of morphine (200mcg) into the intrathecal space at the time&#xD;
      of the operation. The second group will receive a saline injection. The pharmacy will prepare&#xD;
      the aforementioned injections and deliver them to the operating room to ensure all parties&#xD;
      are blinded. Both groups will then have a standardized analgesic regimen (including PCA&#xD;
      morphine and parenteral analgesics) available to them in the post-operative period. Each&#xD;
      group will be followed at regular intervals post-operatively. At each follow-up, visual&#xD;
      analogue pain scores, side effects and narcotic use will be assessed. Patients will also have&#xD;
      a daily functional assessment which will dictate the time of discharge. Hospital stay will be&#xD;
      measured from time of admission to time where patient no longer requires acute hospital care&#xD;
      based on the functional assessment.&#xD;
