  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is a major public health problem in India with an estimated a prevalence of&#xD;
      approximately 4% and 12% in rural and urban areas respectively. Accumulating evidence&#xD;
      suggests that serum cholecalciferol levels may be inversely related to the prevalence of&#xD;
      diabetes, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. The trials available on the effect of&#xD;
      Vitamin D supplementation on insulin/glucose metabolism have been conducted using small&#xD;
      sample sizes in different subgroups document variable results (significant decrease in HbA1c&#xD;
      concentration with insulin concentration in hemodialysis patients; insulin levels lower with&#xD;
      oral Vitamin D in gestational diabetes; no effect of Vitamin D on serum insulin levels in&#xD;
      post menopausal women). A double blind randomized controlled trial conducted at our institute&#xD;
      using 3,60,000 IU of cholecalciferol over 6 weeks documented improvement in OGIS index of&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity. We therefore, plan to study the long term effect of vitamin D&#xD;
      supplementation on peripheral insulin sensitivity.&#xD;

      Volunteers will be recruited from amongst the preventive health check subjects, neighboring&#xD;
      offices, hospital employees and corporate associates of SBISR after obtaining a detailed&#xD;
      informed consent. The study will include 300 subjects with the following selection criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 35 to 75 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Waist circumference (WC) ≥78 cm in men and ≥ 72 cm in women&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruited subjects will be randomized into two groups on the basis of random numbers&#xD;
      generated by a computer after pre-stratification by gender (to allow equal representation of&#xD;
      both sexes) and baseline Vitamin D levels. The baseline information will be recorded on&#xD;
      standardized questionnaire include age, education, marital status, annual household income,&#xD;
      family history, smoking and alcohol use. A complete physical examination will be done&#xD;
      including height, weight, waist circumference and blood pressure. Weight will be recorded on&#xD;
      a manual weighing scale (sensitivity 500 g), height using SECA stadiometer (sensitivity 0.1&#xD;
      cm), waist circumference (WC) at the midpoint between the lower rib and iliac crest using a&#xD;
      measuring tape (sensitivity 0.1 cm), and blood pressure using an OMRON electronic instrument&#xD;
      (sensitivity 1 mmHg; accuracy 3 mmHg) validated in an earlier trial. Height, WC and weight&#xD;
      will recorded with light clothing and without shoes. Three serial BP recordings from the&#xD;
      right arm will be taken after 10 minutes of rest at 10 minute intervals in the sitting&#xD;
      posture as per WHO recommendations. The mean of the three recordings will used for analysis.&#xD;
      Daily sun exposure will be calculated by taking a detailed history of sun exposure separately&#xD;
      during summers and winters and the type of clothing worn. Sun exposure will be calculated as&#xD;
      hours of exposure per day x percentage of body surface area (BSA) exposed (calculated&#xD;
      according to Wallace rule of nine). A detailed dietary assessment by the 24 hour recall&#xD;
      method will be done at baseline to determine the dietary intake of calcium, phosphate and&#xD;
      Vitamin D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting subjects will be advised to fast from 8 pm of the previous night. 10 ml of blood&#xD;
      will be drawn at baseline for the following tests between 9 am to 10 am on the next day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  25 (OH) vitamin D levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum calcium and phosphorus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Liver function tests including total proteins, SGOT, SGPT and alkaline phosphatase&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum creatinine levels The 3-hour Oral GTT will be done after a loading glucose dose of&#xD;
           75 grams with blood sampling at 0, 120 and 180 minutes. The sampling arm will be warmed&#xD;
           for 20 minutes prior to sampling to obtain arterialized venous samples. The blood&#xD;
           samples will be immediately transported to the laboratory where plasma will be separated&#xD;
           for all samples immediately. The samples will be labeled with a random numbers (to avoid&#xD;
           revealing the time sequence of the samples to the laboratory) and stored at -70 C until&#xD;
           assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects in the treatment group will be given cholecalciferol 120,000 IU monthly orally&#xD;
      for one year (~ 4000 IU per day). This dose has been documented to be safe in an earlier&#xD;
      review.The drug will be advised and provided to the subjects at enrollment. The control group&#xD;
      will receive a placebo which will be identical in taste, color and texture. The subjects will&#xD;
      be advised to continue their normal routine and lifestyle and to report immediately for any&#xD;
      vomiting, headache, blurring of vision, abdominal pain, muscle cramps hematuria or hospital&#xD;
      admission. For the purpose of the trial hypercalcemia would be defined as &gt; 2.65 mmol/L,&#xD;
      Urinary calcium: creatinine ratio and ultrasonography will be done if clinically indicated.&#xD;
      Any volunteer developing any adverse effect would be treated as recommended and free of&#xD;
      charge.. Compliance will be monitored by means of a home diary. A mid-term follow-up will be&#xD;
      done at 6 months after recruitment. Instructions will be reinforced at the 6 month follow-up&#xD;
      especially for subjects with poor compliance or other deviations. Final assessment will be&#xD;
      done at 1 year (with margin of +10 days) after recruitment. Follow up assessment for any&#xD;
      subject with a febrile illness will be postponed till 5 days after recovery from fever. A&#xD;
      detailed dietary assessment by the 72 hour recall method will be done at baseline and at the&#xD;
      two follow up visits to determine the dietary intake of calcium, ,phosphate and Vitamin D.&#xD;
      All investigations done at baseline will be repeated at the two follow-up visits. The&#xD;
      investigators and the laboratory will be blinded to the random allocation and the code will&#xD;
      be broken only after the reports are available for all subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The oral glucose sensitivity index as calculated by the Mari's formula as a measure of the&#xD;
      post prandial insulin sensitivity will be evaluated as the primary outcome variable and the&#xD;
      changes in the index will be compared between the supplemented and unsupplemented groups. The&#xD;
      HOMA and QUICKI indices will be similarly analyzed as secondary outcomes indicating the&#xD;
      fasting insulin sensitivity. The incidence of adverse effects will also be compared between&#xD;
      the two groups as a secondary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical Analysis The sample will be centrifuged at 3000 rpm and the serum/plasma would be&#xD;
      stored at -70 C. Serum 25(OH) D will be measured by solvent extraction followed by&#xD;
      radioimmunoassay (Diasorin, USA). Plasma Insulin will be measured by double antibody IRMA&#xD;
      (IMMUNOTECH, France). PTH levels will also be estimated using the double antibody IRMA&#xD;
      (IMMUNOTECH, France). 5% of the samples will be re-run for quality control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size considerations It is estimated that a sample size of 98 subjects in each group&#xD;
      will be required to detect a change in OGIS (Oral Glucose insulin sensitivity; primary&#xD;
      outcome variable) of 10% with an alpha error of 0.05 and a power of 90% based on data&#xD;
      available from the earlier trial conducted at the institute on the subject. To account for&#xD;
      attrition over one year 150 subjects in each group will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Data entry and analysis will be done using Epi-Info 2002 and SPSS v13.0&#xD;
      software. The values for plasma glucose and insulin at the specified times will be used to&#xD;
      calculate the following indices OGIS calculated using the Mari's formula as described&#xD;
      elsewhere will be the primary outcome variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HOMA and QUICKI indices will be calculated from the fasting insulin and glucose samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The student's't' test for paired values will be used to estimate the pre and post&#xD;
      intervention differences in each group. The crude mean difference in two groups will be&#xD;
      compared using the unpaired't' test. Non- compliant subjects and trial deviates will be&#xD;
      analysed in the group allocated for the 'Intention to treat' analysis and will be excluded&#xD;
      for the &quot;per protocol analysis&quot; for studying the differences between groups. The outcomes&#xD;
      will be adjusted for known confounders including age, waist circumference, BMI, baseline&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity, changes in Vitamin D and PTH levels. The subjects will be stratified by&#xD;
      their baseline 25 (OH) D levels into deficient and non-deficient for analysis. Regression&#xD;
      analysis will be used to study the relationship of baseline characteristics with the outcome&#xD;
      variables.&#xD;
