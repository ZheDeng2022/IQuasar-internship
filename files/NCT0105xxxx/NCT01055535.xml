      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of Microplasmin administered as an&#xD;
      intravitreal injection, in subjects with focal vitreomacular adhesion. Ultimately, it is&#xD;
      believed that intravitreal microplasmin may offer physicians a safe agent for pharmacologic&#xD;
      vitreolysis and induction of Posterior Vitreous Detachment (PVD) without the need for&#xD;
      vitrectomy. This clinical study is justified because the study sponsor believes the potential&#xD;
      benefits outweigh the potential risks, as outlined below.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  I. Male or female patients aged &gt; 18&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  II. Presence of focal vitreomacular adhesion (ie, central vitreal adhesion within 6mm&#xD;
             OCT field surrounded by elevation of the posterior vitreous cortex&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  III. BCVA of 20/32 or worse in the study eye&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  IV. BCVA of 20/400 or better in the contralateral eye&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  V. Written informed consent obtained from the patient prior to inclusion in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  I. Evidence of complete macular PVD in the study eye on biomicroscopy, B-scan or OCT&#xD;
             prior to planned study drug injection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  II. Any evidence of proliferative retinopathy meeting the definition for PDR in the&#xD;
             study eye&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  III. Patients with vitreous hemorrhage which precludes either of the following:&#xD;
             visualization of the posterior pole by visual inspection OR adequate assessment of the&#xD;
             macula by either OCT and/or fluorescein angiogram in the study eye&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  IV. Patients with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, PVR, or retinal degenerative&#xD;
             changes associated with increased risk of retinal detachment in the study eye. Such&#xD;
             retinal degenerative changes include lattice degeneration or cystic retinal tufts.&#xD;
             Thorough retinal examination should be performed in all patients to rule out these&#xD;
             changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  V. Patients with high myopia (&gt; 8D) or aphakia in the study eye&#xD;
&#xD;
        VI. Patients with history of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment in the fellow eye VII.&#xD;
        Patients who have had ocular surgery in the study eye in the prior three months VIII.&#xD;
        Patients who have had a vitrectomy in the study eye at any time. IX. Patients with glaucoma&#xD;
        that is not controlled with topical medication or that is associated with severe visual&#xD;
        field loss, documented by perimetry, in the study eye X. Patients who have had laser&#xD;
        photocoagulation treatment in the study eye in the previous 3 months XI. Intravitreal&#xD;
        injection of any drug in the study eye in the previous 3 months XII. Patients who are&#xD;
        pregnant or of child-bearing potential not utilizing a form of contraception acceptable to&#xD;
        the Investigator XIII. Patients who, in the investigators view, will not complete all&#xD;
        visits and investigations, including the last visit at 6 months after the last injection&#xD;
        XIV. Patients who have participated in an investigational drug study within the past 30&#xD;
        days XV. Patients with hypertension (either SBP &gt; 170 or DBP &gt; 100 mm Hg) XVI. Patients&#xD;
        with a life expectancy less than 6 months XVII. Patients who have previously participated&#xD;
        in this trial&#xD;
