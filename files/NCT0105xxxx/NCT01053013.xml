  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical research study of an investigational (FDA BB-IND 10091) treatment for&#xD;
      patients with pancreatic cancer (all stages) and advanced colorectal cancer that no longer&#xD;
      responds to standard therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment is being evaluated for its effect on tumor growth. It consists of the placement&#xD;
      (implantation) of small beads that contain mouse renal adenocarcinoma cells (RENCA&#xD;
      macrobeads). The cells in the macrobeads produce substances that have been shown to slow or&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumors in experimental animals and veterinary patients. It has been tested&#xD;
      in 31 human subjects with different types of cancers in a Phase I safety trial. Phase II&#xD;
      studies in patients with colorectal, pancreatic or prostate cancers are in progress.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial. The study will have a duration of 12 months and&#xD;
      involve a potential total of four macrobead implants for each enrolled patient, with the&#xD;
      implants being no less than three months apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RENCA macrobeads are implanted intraperitoneally, using laparoscopic surgical procedures.&#xD;
      The macrobeads remain permanently within the peritoneal cavity, even if patients withdraw&#xD;
      from the study and/or begin new therapy (e.g. chemotherapy). After the formal phase of the&#xD;
      trial is completed, subjects will be followed for life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intent of this Phase 2 trial is to assess efficacy, safety, and tolerability of RENCA&#xD;
      macrobeads. Screening occurs within 28 days prior to first implantation. Enrolled patients&#xD;
      are treated with a dose of 8 RENCA macrobeads per kilogram of body weight and observed for a&#xD;
      minimum of 3 months prior to the next implantation. A maximum of 4 implantation procedures is&#xD;
      possible. Day 0 is the day of implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the start of the study, the Investigators ensured that the protocol and any&#xD;
      attendant documentation were approved, in writing, by the Institutional Review Board. The&#xD;
      study was conducted in compliance with the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) of&#xD;
      Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use Good Clinical&#xD;
      Practice Guidelines (E6 [R1]) for conducting, recording, and reporting studies, as well as&#xD;
      for archiving essential documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators, the Medical Monitor of the sponsor, and the Data Safety Monitoring Board&#xD;
      were responsible for monitoring safety parameters collected in the study. They, collectively,&#xD;
      provided oversight and monitoring of the safety of the participants in the study.&#xD;

    <measure>Necrosis Comparison of Tumors Using PET-CT Scan</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline vs. Day 90 post-Implant 1</time_frame>
    <description>Tumors were assessed by positron emission tomography (PET)-CT scan at baseline and day 90 following the first RENCA macrobead implantation. The use of [13]F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake for the detection of lesions &gt;1 cm in diameter allowed evaluation of metabolic activity. Decreases in FDG uptake were indicative of metabolic suppression of the tumor. The use of PET-CT scanning indicated anatomical localization, approximate size/volume of primary tumor and metastatic lesion(s), and assessment of metabolic activity of the tumor (as an indicator of metabolic health and necrosis).&#xD;
Disease state is reported as a function of Tumor measurement divided by SUVmax. Changes were assessed between day 90 post RENCA macrobead implant and baseline values. Patients with no change = stable; patients with decreased values = decreased/necrosis, and patients with increased values = increased.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Participants were recruited based on physician referral between April 2010 and February 2016. The first participant was implanted on April 15, 2010 (pancreatic) and May 14, 2010 (mCRC). The last implantation was on March 4, 2016 (pancreatic) and October 18, 2013 (mCRC).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>90 participants provided informed consent to participate in the study (Pancreatic cancer n=34; mCRC n=46). Of these, 24 pancreatic cancer patients and 34 mCRC patients were enrolled in the study. The 22 patients who were not enrolled into the study, after providing consent, had failed the respective eligibility criteria (n=19) or decided not to enroll in the study (n=3).</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Necrosis Comparison of Tumors Using PET-CT Scan</title>
        <description>Tumors were assessed by positron emission tomography (PET)-CT scan at baseline and day 90 following the first RENCA macrobead implantation. The use of [13]F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake for the detection of lesions &gt;1 cm in diameter allowed evaluation of metabolic activity. Decreases in FDG uptake were indicative of metabolic suppression of the tumor. The use of PET-CT scanning indicated anatomical localization, approximate size/volume of primary tumor and metastatic lesion(s), and assessment of metabolic activity of the tumor (as an indicator of metabolic health and necrosis).&#xD;
Disease state is reported as a function of Tumor measurement divided by SUVmax. Changes were assessed between day 90 post RENCA macrobead implant and baseline values. Patients with no change = stable; patients with decreased values = decreased/necrosis, and patients with increased values = increased.</description>

        <title>Performance Status (ECOG Score) of mCRC Participants</title>
        <description>The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance scale is a 5-point scale, where 0 denotes perfect health and 5 is death. It is used by clinicians to assess disease progression and how the disease is affecting the daily living abilities of the patient. The ECOG Performance Status scores are defined as follows:&#xD;
0: Fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease activities without restriction.&#xD;
Restricted in physical strenuous activity, but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature (e.g. light house work, office work).&#xD;
Ambulatory and capable of all self-care, but unable to carry out any work activities, up and about more than 50% of waking hours.&#xD;
Capable of only limited self-care, confined to bed or chair 50% or more of waking hours.&#xD;
Completely disabled, cannot carry on any self-care, totally confined to bed or chair.&#xD;

          <title>Performance Status (ECOG Score) of mCRC Participants</title>
          <description>The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance scale is a 5-point scale, where 0 denotes perfect health and 5 is death. It is used by clinicians to assess disease progression and how the disease is affecting the daily living abilities of the patient. The ECOG Performance Status scores are defined as follows:&#xD;
0: Fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease activities without restriction.&#xD;
Restricted in physical strenuous activity, but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature (e.g. light house work, office work).&#xD;
Ambulatory and capable of all self-care, but unable to carry out any work activities, up and about more than 50% of waking hours.&#xD;
Capable of only limited self-care, confined to bed or chair 50% or more of waking hours.&#xD;
Completely disabled, cannot carry on any self-care, totally confined to bed or chair.&#xD;
Death</description>

        <title>Global Health Status of mCRC Participants</title>
        <description>The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30, version 3.0) consists of 30 questions which pertain to: five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status score, and six single items.&#xD;
The Global Health Status is assessed from 2 of the 30 questions (Question 29 and 30), whose response score ranges on a 7 point scale. The score for physical function is calculated based on the average score from these 2 questions. A linear transformation is used to standardize these responses. Using this linear transformation, the minimum value is 0 (worst outcome, poor) and the maximum value is 100 (best outcome, excellent). Therefore, increasing values indicate better outcome and decreasing values indicate worse outcome.</description>

          <title>Global Health Status of Pancreatic Cancer Participants</title>
          <description>The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30, version 3.0) consists of 30 questions which pertain to: five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status score, and six single items.&#xD;
The Global Health Status is assessed from 2 of the 30 questions (Question 29 and 30), whose response score ranges on a 7 point scale. The score for physical function is calculated based on the average score from these 2 questions. A linear transformation is used to standardize these responses. Using this linear transformation, the minimum value is 0 (worst outcome, poor) and the maximum value is 100 (best outcome, excellent). Therefore, increasing values indicate better outcome and decreasing values indicate worse outcome.</description>
          <population>Implant 1 (Days 0-60): Pancreatic cancer participants who had received at least 1 macrobead implantation and were screened as indicated; Implant 2 (Days 0-60): Pancreatic cancer participants who had received at least 2 macrobead implantations and were screened as indicated. In some cases, participants may not have had all assessments conducted as scheduled. In those incidents, the number of participants analyzed has been adjusted to include only those participants for which data was available.</population>

        <title>Role Function of Pancreatic Cancer Participants</title>
        <description>The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30, version 3.0) consists of 30 questions which pertain to: five functional scales (including role function), three symptom scales, a global health status score, and six single items.&#xD;
Role Function is assessed from 2 of the 30 questions (Questions 6 and 7), whose response score ranges on a 4 point scale. The score for role function is calculated based on the average score from these 2 questions. A linear transformation is used to standardize these responses. Using this linear transformation, the minimum value is 0 (worst outcome, poor functionality) and the maximum value is 100 (best outcome, better functionality). Therefore, increasing values indicate better outcome and decreasing values indicate worse outcome.</description>

        <title>Cognitive Function of Pancreatic Cancer Participants</title>
        <description>The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30, version 3.0) consists of 30 questions which pertain to: five functional scales (including cognitive function), three symptom scales, a global health status score, and six single items.&#xD;
Cognitive Function is assessed from 2 of the 30 questions (Question 20 and 25), whose response score ranges on a 4 point scale. The score for role function is calculated based on the average score from these 2 questions. A linear transformation is used to standardize these responses. Using this linear transformation, the minimum value is 0 (worst outcome, poor functionality) and the maximum value is 100 (best outcome, better functionality). Therefore, increasing values indicate better outcome and decreasing values indicate worse outcome.</description>
