    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine if 2-week repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation&#xD;
      at the subacute phase of stroke (between day 7 and day 14) improves significantly arm&#xD;
      motility at 3 months with remaining effect at one year, without significant adverse effect.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke survivors may be left with disability involving speech or residual arm or leg&#xD;
      weakness. Despite spontaneous improvement on the weeks following stroke, the importance of&#xD;
      final disability is unpredictable. If the core of the infarct is represented by dead neurons,&#xD;
      the neurons from adjacent areas seem to be staggered and their lack of excitability has been&#xD;
      correlated to a bad prognosis. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) seems to&#xD;
      be a promising technique since high frequency rTMS can increase excitability of the targeted&#xD;
      neurons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to evaluate after 2 weeks of 20 min of rTMS each day: 1) the&#xD;
      improvement of arm function and neurological and disability scales, immediately after the&#xD;
      2-week session, at one month, 3 months and evaluate the remnant effect at 12 months, 2) to&#xD;
      correlate these scales to physiological parameters in order to assess the clinical&#xD;
      modifications to the electrophysiological modifications, 3) to assert the safety of high&#xD;
      frequency rTMS at the subacute phase of ischaemic stroke.&#xD;
