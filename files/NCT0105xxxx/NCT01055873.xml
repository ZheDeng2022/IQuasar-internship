      ANRS-EP38-IMMIP is a non interventional study. A single blood sample (30 mL) was drawn during&#xD;
      a hospital visit for clinical follow-up. Immunological assays were performed on fresh blood.&#xD;
      Cells and plasma were stored and kept frozen for additional biological evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are included in the French perinatal cohort (ANRS CO-10), or have been followed&#xD;
      since before 1996 in the same clinical sites as patients who belong to ANRS CO-10. In the&#xD;
      ANRS CO-10 cohort, all patients are prospectively followed from birth.&#xD;

      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficient anti-retroviral treatments lead to a significantly increased life expectancy.&#xD;
      Children with perinatal infection are now reaching adulthood. The deleterious impact of viral&#xD;
      replication during ontogenesis of the immune system, and the high thymic activity during the&#xD;
      early years of life, preclude an extrapolation from data pertaining to the adult immune&#xD;
      status and mean that specific pediatric studies are required. No data are available&#xD;
      concerning the immune status of adolescents or young adults infected via materno-foetal&#xD;
      transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our assumption is that the duration of uncontrolled viral replication will affect the immune&#xD;
      status after treatment because viral replication is associated with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. disease progression independently of CD4+ T cell levels;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. accelerated senescence of the immune system;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. destruction of organs involved in the restoration of major immune cell populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to describe the immune and virological status of perinatally infected patients that are&#xD;
           above 15 yrs old and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to study their associations with :&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. the current virological/clinical and therapeutic status,&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. the duration of uncontrolled viremia (defined by treatment history),&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. the virological, immunological (CD4+ numbers), and clinical status at time of HAART&#xD;
                initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immune status will be defined by (1) the number and phenotype of CD4+ and CD8+ T&#xD;
      lymphocytes, dendritic cells, regulatory T cells, and NK cells, (2) the functions&#xD;
      (proliferation and cytokine production) of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes that are specific for&#xD;
      HIV, a recall antigen (tetanus toxoid) and other viruses (CMV, EBV and Flu),the repertoire of&#xD;
      Natural Killer cell receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The virological status will be defined by the level of HIV DNA in PBMCs, the HIV subtype,&#xD;
      resistance mutations in archived and circulating virus and sequences of the regions of the&#xD;
      viral envelope involved in co-receptor use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical, therapeutic, demographic, virological and immunological data are collected from&#xD;
      birth for members of the ANRS CO-10 cohort, and will be collected retrospectively since&#xD;
      diagnosis for non-included patients.&#xD;
