    <textblock>
      The study (forward-looking and opened) will concern 70 subjects having had a systemic&#xD;
      prolonged treatment with corticosteroids for intestinal chronic inflammatory disease,&#xD;
      recruited in the services of gastroenterology and endocrinology of the North Hospital of&#xD;
      Marseille (France). The primary objective of the study is to estimate a new test, the &quot;long&quot;&#xD;
      synacthen stimulation test, using an IM injection of 1 mg of delate synacthen, with regard to&#xD;
      the definitive standard. Indeed, this long test could be realized in ambulatory conditions,&#xD;
      and turn out more contributory than the definitive standard to estimate the capacities of&#xD;
      answer of the adrenal glands in front of a prolonged stress, as it is the case during a&#xD;
      surgical procedure for example.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are: 1) to determine the relation between the value of basal&#xD;
      cortisol and the peak of stimulation of cortisol during short and long tests. This could&#xD;
      allow to clarify better the conditions in which it is absolutely necessary to realize a&#xD;
      dynamic test, 2) to determine the relation between cortisol assay in the plasma and in the&#xD;
      saliva. The sample of saliva is simple and non-invasive, and presents the advantage to be&#xD;
      able to be realized in ambulatory conditions and by the patient himself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cortisonic withdrawal syndrome is another complication which can arise when a prolonged&#xD;
      corticosteroid therapy is discontinued. Clinically, it looks like a chronic adrenocortical&#xD;
      insufficiency, but with normal ranges of plasma cortisol. It is probably in touch with a&#xD;
      physical dependence to the taking of above physiological doses of GC over a long period. Its&#xD;
      physiopathology remains badly known, but could bring in a deficit of secretion of DHEA-S&#xD;
      (dehydro-epiandrosterone sulphate), another hormone secreted by the adrenal glands. One of&#xD;
      the secondary objectives of the study will consist in informing the variations of DHEA-S&#xD;
      after a prolonged corticotherapy, in the basal state and after stimulation by the long&#xD;
      synacthen stimulation test.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Synthetic glucocorticoids (GC) are used in the treatment of numerous inflammatory or&#xD;
      auto-immune diseases, in particular the intestinal chronic inflammatory diseases (Crohn's&#xD;
      disease, chronic ulcerative colitis). In case of discontinuation of a prolonged (superior to&#xD;
      3-4 weeks) and systemic treatment, deleterious side effects are frequent, with in particular&#xD;
      a risk of adrenocortical insufficiency and withdrawal cortisonic syndrome. Our protocol of&#xD;
      medical research concerns these two complications, and aims at optimizing the evaluation of&#xD;
      the adrenal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adrenocortical insufficiency after prolonged corticotherapy is the most frequent cause of&#xD;
      secondary adrenocortical insufficiency. It is due to the braking of the&#xD;
      hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis which controls the endogenous secretion of cortisol.&#xD;
      It is mostly transient, but can last several months, and exposes to a risk of acute&#xD;
      decompensation. An adapted coverage with replacement doses of hydrocortisone (natural GC) is&#xD;
      thus necessary during the treatment discontinuation, together with regular hormonal&#xD;
      revaluations to track down the recovery of the adrenal function. These evaluations are based&#xD;
      on biological measurements, because of the absence of specific clinical symptoms. At first,&#xD;
      basal plasma cortisol at 08:00 am (physiological peak of the hormone) is assayed. A value&#xD;
      lower than 8 µg / dl (220 nmol / l) allows to do the positive diagnosis of adrenal&#xD;
      insufficiency and a value superior to 20 µg / dl (550 nmol / l) to exclude it. Between these&#xD;
      2 values, a doubt remains on the capacities of the adrenal glands to secrete enough cortisol&#xD;
      in case of stress, and the realization of a dynamic test of stimulation is then necessary.&#xD;
      The standard test used in common practice is the &quot;short&quot; synacthene stimulation test&#xD;
      (fragment 1-24 of the ACTH, the hormone secreted by the pituitary gland and stimulating the&#xD;
      secretion of cortisol) using an IV injection of 250 µg of immediate synacthen. The study&#xD;
      (forward-looking and opened) will concern 70 subjects having had a systemic prolonged&#xD;
      treatment with corticosteroids for intestinal chronic inflammatory disease, recruited in the&#xD;
      services of gastroenterology and endocrinology of the North Hospital of Marseille (France).&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to estimate a new test, the &quot;long&quot; synacthen&#xD;
      stimulation test, using an IM injection of 1 mg of delate synacthen, with regard to the&#xD;
      definitive standard. Indeed, this long test could be realized in ambulatory conditions, and&#xD;
      turn out more contributory than the definitive standard to estimate the capacities of answer&#xD;
      of the adrenal glands in front of a prolonged stress, as it is the case during a surgical&#xD;
      procedure for example.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are: 1) to determine the relation between the value of basal&#xD;
      cortisol and the peak of stimulation of cortisol during short and long tests. This could&#xD;
      allow to clarify better the conditions in which it is absolutely necessary to realize a&#xD;
      dynamic test, 2) to determine the relation between cortisol assay in the plasma (classically&#xD;
      used) and in the saliva ( which is validated for the evaluation of the other adrenal&#xD;
      pathology as the Cushing's syndrome, but not still in the adrenocortical insufficiency after&#xD;
      prolonged corticotherapy). The sample of saliva is simple and non-invasive, and presents the&#xD;
      advantage to be able to be realized in ambulatory conditions and by the patient himself.&#xD;
