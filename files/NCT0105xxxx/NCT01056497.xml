  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronically elevated free fatty acids impair insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion (ie&#xD;
      lipotoxicity) by a combination of oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and&#xD;
      inflammation. This study will test whether alpha-lipoic acid, which has potent antioxidant&#xD;
      and anti-inflammatory properties, prevents or ameliorates lipotoxicity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alpha-Lipoic Acid (ALA) is a naturally occurring dithiol compound absorbed intact from&#xD;
      dietary sources and synthesized enzymatically in the mitochondrion from octanoic acid. It&#xD;
      serves a critical role in mitochondrial energy metabolism and is a potent biological&#xD;
      antioxidant. It is widely available as an over-the-counter health supplement. It has&#xD;
      generated considerable interest among the lay public and the research community for the use&#xD;
      of ALA as a nutritive supplement and as a pharmacotherapy for diabetes and many other&#xD;
      disorders. There is growing evidence that ALA has beneficial effects on the treatment of type&#xD;
      2 diabetes (T2DM) and some of its complications. It represents an attractive pharmacological&#xD;
      target in the treatment of T2DM by modulating the signal transduction pathways in insulin&#xD;
      resistance and antagonizing the oxidative and inflammatory stresses, which are major pathways&#xD;
      in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Chronic elevation of plasma FFAs are believed to&#xD;
      contribute to insulin resistance and defects in insulin secretion by promoting oxidative&#xD;
      stress and inflammation. A potent antioxidant and free radical scavenger, ALA also targets&#xD;
      cellular signal transduction pathways, which increases glucose uptake and utilization, thus&#xD;
      providing specific targeted therapy in the treatment of insulin resistance. ALA has been&#xD;
      shown to be safe when taken in high doses (2400mg/d) for prolonged time periods (6 months and&#xD;
      longer), even in patients with renal and liver failure. In fact no upper limit for ALA&#xD;
      consumption in humans has been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each subject will undergo 4 studies, 4 to 6 weeks apart. Each study will consist of a 2&#xD;
           week treatment period with either oral ALA tablets or placebo tablets, followed by 30&#xD;
           hour hospital stay to infuse lipid or saline and to test insulin sensitivity and insulin&#xD;
           secretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will be conducted as a single blind study, with the subject not knowing&#xD;
           whether they are receiving a placebo or ALA. For safety reasons and since it will not&#xD;
           influence the results of this study it will not be conducted as a double blind study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On each of four occasions, 4 weeks apart, after taking the tablets for 2 weeks, the&#xD;
           subject will fast overnight for 12-hours prior to their admission to the Toronto General&#xD;
           Hospital metabolic research ward for 30 hours to undergo testing as follows. The four&#xD;
           studies will be conducted in random order:&#xD;
