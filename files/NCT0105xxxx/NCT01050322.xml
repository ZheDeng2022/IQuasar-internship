  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite these initial positive signals in recent statistics, breast cancer continues to claim&#xD;
      a substantial number of lives approximately 500,000 deaths worldwide in 2005 Thus the current&#xD;
      treatment paradigm - surgery, radiation and systemic chemo and or hormonal therapy and&#xD;
      biological therapies -still fails to cure a significant number of women with early breast&#xD;
      cancer and new treatment strategies are needed to improve current results both in early and&#xD;
      advance disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrent or metastatic breast cancer is an incurable malignancy with a median survival of&#xD;
      20-24 months [Hortobagyi , 1998] and this has not changed significantly over the last decade&#xD;
      with fewer than 20% of patients still alive at 5 years after a diagnosis of recurrence.&#xD;
      Although there have been small improvements in survival with the new therapies, metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer remains an incurable and, ultimately, fatal disease. The introduction of novel&#xD;
      combination therapies have the potential to target different pathways in the cancer cell,&#xD;
      leading to improved efficacy. Further studies to optimize combination therapy, while&#xD;
      ameliorating AEs, are critically important to patients with metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lapatinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor which potently inhibits both EGFR and&#xD;
      HER2[Spector, 2005]. Lapatinib in combination with capecitabine is approved in more than 20&#xD;
      countries for the treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer whose&#xD;
      tumors overexpress HER2. All patients in the study leading to the lapatinib approval had&#xD;
      received prior therapy including an anthracycline, a taxane, and trastuzumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relevance of the HER2/neu target in breast cancer, combined with the promising&#xD;
      preclinical and clinical data regarding the use of lapatinib, provide the rationale for a&#xD;
      formal evaluation of this agent combined with other non taxane agents as gemcitabine or&#xD;
      vinorelbine after progression on taxanes and trastuzumab based therapies in metastatic&#xD;
      disease setting as these chemotherapy options are used in daily practice in this subset of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized phase II, open label,multicentric , international, 3 arms treatment&#xD;
      study in patients with confirmed HER2+ metastatic breast cancer after taxane progression .&#xD;
      The main objective is to investigate the (CBR) and safety in 3 different combinations of&#xD;
      Lapatinib therapy (plus capecitabine or gemcitabine or vinorelbine) and to determine whether&#xD;
      either, or both, of Lapatinib /Vinorelbine or Lapatinib/Gemcitabine can be considered a&#xD;
      reasonable alternative to the established Lapatinib/Capecitabine standard combination . The&#xD;
      decision as to whether to study either of the new combinations further will be based on both&#xD;
      the toxicity and the efficacy profiles.&#xD;

      In areas where trastuzumab is available with no barriers to access, all patients must have&#xD;
      received trastuzumab in the adjuvant or metastatic setting . However, in countries where&#xD;
      trastuzumab is not approved or is not available to patients due to reimbursement or other&#xD;
      considerations, trastuzumab naïve patients are allowed considering the efficacy data of&#xD;
      Lapatinib in this subset of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial uses a design to ensure a selection of one or more of the better treatment&#xD;
      combination for additional clinical Approximately (165), who meet the criteria for efficacy&#xD;
      analysis as defined, will be enrolled in the study in a single stage process. The sample size&#xD;
      will be accrued in 16 months, with further follow-up for a 24 months study period from&#xD;
      randomization or until progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes a Screening/Baseline Period, a Treatment Period and a post-treatment&#xD;
      Follow-Up Period. Patients will continue to receive investigational products until disease&#xD;
      progression or early discontinuation from investigational product for other reasons. Patients&#xD;
      who discontinue investigational product(s) without disease progression will continue to be&#xD;
      evaluated for efficacy until progression or until receiving the first subsequent anti-cancer&#xD;
      therapy. Once progression is documented, all patients will be followed for survival at&#xD;
      approximately 3-month intervals until death.&#xD;
