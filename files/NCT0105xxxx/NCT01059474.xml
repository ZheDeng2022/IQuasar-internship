    <textblock>
      DMPS is a metal chelator which is approved for use in Europe. While not an FDA-approved drug&#xD;
      in the US, it is easily obtained and administered by alternative health practitioners to&#xD;
      their patients. A formulation called 'TD DMPS' (transdermal DMPS) is in use, despite the fact&#xD;
      there is no published literature to support that the agent is absorbed transdermally. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesis is that DMPS is not absorbed through the skin. The investigators&#xD;
      plan to apply TD DMPS to healthy volunteers and then test serum for presence of DMPS. In&#xD;
      addition the investigators will measure urinary mercury concentrations pre and post DMPS&#xD;
      application.&#xD;

      I. Background Information and Literature:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonate (DMPS) is a chelating agent that has been used for years in&#xD;
      Europe for treatment of poisoning by metals such as mercury, arsenic, and lead. It is a water&#xD;
      soluble analog of dimercaptopropanol (British anti-Lewisite, or BAL), which is an FDA&#xD;
      approved chelating agent administered via deep intramuscular injection. DMPS is not FDA&#xD;
      approved, but is approved in Europe and is available in Germany without a prescription, as&#xD;
      Dimaval. It is felt to have less toxicity than BAL, and unlike BAL, is effective when&#xD;
      administered orally(1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comprehensive review by Aposhian, et al (1) notes that DMPS has been studied since the late&#xD;
      1950's in the Soviet Union and China and appears innocuous. This review mentions a 1979 study&#xD;
      which followed 168 scleroderma patients receiving DMPS for 10 years. Some patients&#xD;
      experienced mild side effects such as minor allergic reaction (26 patients, none with&#xD;
      anaphylaxis), nausea (11 patients), vertigo (7 patients), weakness (4 patients), or itching&#xD;
      (3 patients). No renal toxicity was noted. Additionally, chelation therapy with oral DMPS was&#xD;
      found to be safe when used in a series of patients with methylmercury toxicity from&#xD;
      contaminated grain in Iraq in 1972 (2). It was also not associated with any adverse effects&#xD;
      when used to orally chelate lead poisoned children in Baltimore, Maryland in 1985 (3). This&#xD;
      1985 study cites case series of DMPS being safely and effectively used for treatment of lead&#xD;
      poisoning and inorganic mercury poisoning as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DMPS showed no mutagenicity in the Ames salmonella microsome plate test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Soviet studies showed that when their usual human dose of 5mg/kg IV was increased to 100mg/kg&#xD;
      IV, ulceration or necrosis at the injection site was noted. Animal studies with very large&#xD;
      (50mg/kg) IV doses showed tremors, tachycardia, dyspnea, vomiting, and defecation. Other&#xD;
      animal studies, however, noted no behavioral, weight, or blood composition changes in animals&#xD;
      given 15 or 80mg/kg IV DMPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Animal and human data demonstrated DMPS to be less toxic than the currently FDA approved&#xD;
      chelating agent, BAL (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study proposes to apply a single dose of a liquid formulation of DMPS to the skin. Though&#xD;
      there is no available animal or human data on this form of application, it is being used&#xD;
      throughout the U.S. by many naturopaths and physicians as a chelating agent for children with&#xD;
      autism. In the pamphlets and protocols of these physicians, the only side effects they&#xD;
      mention seeing are mild skin rash and, with chronic therapy, possible depletion of other&#xD;
      necessary metals (such as zinc and magnesium), for which they provide a mineral supplement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since we will be using a small, one-time only dose, there is no risk of significant metal or&#xD;
      mineral depletion. The main risk to subjects will be mild skin rash, which can easily be&#xD;
      monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Manufacturing information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The transdermal DMPS to be used in the study will be obtained from Bellevue Pharmacy, a&#xD;
      compounding pharmacy (1034 S. Brentwood Blvd. Suite 102 St. Louis, MO 63117), which supplies&#xD;
      this product to doctors all over the U.S. According to the literature they provide, the&#xD;
      product is an anhydrous gel dispensed in 30 ml bottles. Each drop reportedly contains 1mg of&#xD;
      DMPS and 4mg of glutathione. We will buy the product we need for the study in one bulk batch&#xD;
      since each subject will only be getting one dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to conducting the study, a bottle will be sent to the FDA lab to be analyzed for&#xD;
      confirmation of the presence of DMPS in the gel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Investigator Qualifications:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal Investigator:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anne-Michelle Ruha, MD, FACMT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assistant Investigator:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Jennifer Smith, MD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both investigators are board certified emergency physicians, Dr. Ruha is a board certified&#xD;
      medical toxicologist, and Dr. Smith is near completion of her fellowship in medical&#xD;
      toxicology (see attached curriculum vitae). At least one investigator will be present at all&#xD;
      times during the application of the product and the follow-up blood draws. We will be&#xD;
      prepared to deal with any acute reactions which occur, allergic or otherwise. After this time&#xD;
      period we will be available by phone via the poison center 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for&#xD;
      any concerns or complications experienced by study subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Study Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since transdermal DMPS delivery is widely used but has not been studied, the clinical&#xD;
      question we wish to answer is whether DMPS is absorbed through the skin after transdermal&#xD;
      application and if so, whether it increases urinary mercury excretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit 10 healthy adult volunteers, over 18 years of age, who eat at least three&#xD;
      servings of fish per week (since this diet is associated with detectable levels of mercury in&#xD;
      the urine which may rise following chelation). Patients with known allergies to DMPS or sulfa&#xD;
      drugs or history of neurologic or renal disease will be excluded. We will also control for&#xD;
      number of mercury containing dental amalgams. History will be obtained regarding any&#xD;
      potential mercury exposures or recent vaccinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 hr urine mercury and creatinine levels will be measured on all volunteers prior to any&#xD;
      treatment. The urine will be collected in acid-washed or heavy-metal-free specialty&#xD;
      containers. It will be refrigerated during and after the collection period and shipped to NMS&#xD;
      labs (with cooling pack) for measurement of mercury levels and mercury:creatinine ratios.&#xD;
      Each volunteer will then receive 120 mg of transdermal DMPS, applied to the bicep area of one&#xD;
      arm. The area of application will not exceed 2% body surface area. The dose of DMPS was&#xD;
      determined based on the &quot;challenge dose&quot; from the &quot;Buttar Autism treatment Protocol&quot;, used by&#xD;
      Dr. Rashid Buttar in his clinic for the treatment of autistic children. This protocol advises&#xD;
      use of 3 mg/kg, with a max dose of 120 mg. After dosing, urine will be collected for the next&#xD;
      12 hours (using the same protocol and send-out procedure) and assayed for mercury and&#xD;
      creatinine levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, after dosing, an intravenous catheter will be placed in the arm of each subject&#xD;
      for blood draws. Blood samples will be obtained at 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 90 minutes, 2&#xD;
      hours, 4 hours and 6 hours after application of the DMPS. These samples will be sent to the&#xD;
      FDA for DMPS analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be monitored during application and for the subsequent 6 hours for the&#xD;
      development of skin rash or any other symptoms related to the DMPS, though this is unlikely.&#xD;
      If rash develops the skin will be washed and the reaction can be treated as necessary. At the&#xD;
      end of the 6 hours, the skin will be cleansed with soap and water and the treatment period&#xD;
      ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When analyzing the data after collection, we will first look at whether any DMPS was&#xD;
      detectable in the blood after application. If so, we will examine the 12 hour urine mercury&#xD;
      levels from before and after application to determine whether this increased. We will control&#xD;
      for number of dental amalgams, which can affect baseline urinary Hg levels. If an increase is&#xD;
      detected, we will compare the magnitude of this increase to available data on urinary Hg&#xD;
      excretion increase after oral DMPS administration.&#xD;
