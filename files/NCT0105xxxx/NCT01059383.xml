  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to assess the effect and safety of oral administration of VECAM 40/300&#xD;
      administered at bedtime compared to Esomeprazole 20 mg administered 30-60 minutes before&#xD;
      dinner, for control of nighttime and daytime HB and other 24 hour GERD symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rational for the study is based on the contention that VECAM exhibits potent inhibition&#xD;
      of acid secretion and because of its mechanism of action, it can be administered at bedtime&#xD;
      without food. Such timing of drug dosing will allow effective inhibition of nighttime acid&#xD;
      secretion. Because of its mechanism of action, VECAM exhibits improved 24-hour inhibition of&#xD;
      acid secretion and hence, its bedtime administration will not compromise its effect during&#xD;
      the daytime. This improved control of acid secretion will predictably result in better&#xD;
      control of nighttime as well as daytime heartburn (HB) symptoms.&#xD;
