    <measure>Change From Baseline in the 16-Item Negative Symptoms Assessment (NSA-16)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, randomization treatment Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The NSA-16 scale is used to help clinicians rate behaviors (not psychopathology) commonly associated with negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The scale rates participants on 16 &quot;anchors&quot;. Each item (&quot;anchor&quot;) is rated from 1 (better) to 6 (worse). The total score is the sum of the 16 specific items and ranges from 16 to 96. Higher scores indicate greater severity of illness. The Mixed Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) analysis was used to calculate Least Squares (LS) mean and standard error. LS mean values are controlled for visit, pooled investigative site, treatment, standard of care (SOC) type, baseline positive symptom stratum, treatment*visit, baseline NSA-16 total score, and baseline NSA-16 total score*visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the 16-Item Negative Symptoms Assessment (NSA-16)</title>
        <description>The NSA-16 scale is used to help clinicians rate behaviors (not psychopathology) commonly associated with negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The scale rates participants on 16 &quot;anchors&quot;. Each item (&quot;anchor&quot;) is rated from 1 (better) to 6 (worse). The total score is the sum of the 16 specific items and ranges from 16 to 96. Higher scores indicate greater severity of illness. The Mixed Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) analysis was used to calculate Least Squares (LS) mean and standard error. LS mean values are controlled for visit, pooled investigative site, treatment, standard of care (SOC) type, baseline positive symptom stratum, treatment*visit, baseline NSA-16 total score, and baseline NSA-16 total score*visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) Overall Composite T-Score</title>
        <description>MCCB is an instrument that contains 10 tests to measure cognitive performance in 7 cognitive domains: speed processing, attention/vigilance, working memory, verbal learning, visual learning, reasoning and problem solving, and social cognition. The MCCB overall composite T-score combines the individual scores of the 10 tests and scores them on a normative scale to derive a T-score, where the mean is 50 and a standard deviation is 10 for the MCCB overall composite T-score. Higher scores indicate better cognition. The Mixed Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) analysis was used to calculate Least Squares (LS) mean and standard error. LS mean values are controlled for visit, pooled investigative site, treatment, standard of care (SOC) type, baseline positive symptom stratum, treatment*visit, baseline MCCB overall composite T-score, and baseline MCCB overall composite T-score*visit.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) Overall Composite T-Score</title>
          <description>MCCB is an instrument that contains 10 tests to measure cognitive performance in 7 cognitive domains: speed processing, attention/vigilance, working memory, verbal learning, visual learning, reasoning and problem solving, and social cognition. The MCCB overall composite T-score combines the individual scores of the 10 tests and scores them on a normative scale to derive a T-score, where the mean is 50 and a standard deviation is 10 for the MCCB overall composite T-score. Higher scores indicate better cognition. The Mixed Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) analysis was used to calculate Least Squares (LS) mean and standard error. LS mean values are controlled for visit, pooled investigative site, treatment, standard of care (SOC) type, baseline positive symptom stratum, treatment*visit, baseline MCCB overall composite T-score, and baseline MCCB overall composite T-score*visit.</description>
          <population>All randomized participants who received at least one dose of study drug, had a baseline and at least one post-baseline MCCB overall composite T-score measurement.</population>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) Total Score</title>
          <description>The AIMS is a 12-item scale designed to record the occurrence of dyskinetic movements. Items 1 to 10 are rated on a 5- point scale, with 0 being no dyskinetic movements and 4 being severe dyskinetic movements. Items 11 and 12 are yes/no questions regarding the dental condition of a subject. The AIMS 1-7 total score is the total of items 1 through 7 of the AIMS, and ranges from 0 to 28. Higher scores indicate greater severity of illness. The Mixed Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) analysis was used to calculate Least Squares (LS) mean and standard error. LS mean values are controlled for visit, pooled investigative site, treatment, standard of care (SOC) type, baseline positive symptom stratum, treatment*visit, baseline AIMS 1-7 total score, and baseline AIMS 1-7 total score*visit.</description>

        <description>Columbia Suicide Rating Scale (C-SSRS) captures occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors. Suicidal ideation: a &quot;yes&quot; answer to any one of 5 suicidal ideation questions: wish to be dead, and 4 different categories of active suicidal ideation. Suicidal behavior: a &quot;yes&quot; answer to any of 5 suicidal behavior questions: preparatory acts or behavior, aborted attempt, interrupted attempt, actual attempt, and completed suicide. Percentage of participants with incidence of potentially clinically significant change of the C-SSRS was calculated as the number of participants with an increase in suicidal behavior or ideation over baseline, divided by the total number of participants multiplied by 100.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D is a generic, multidimensional, health-related, quality-of-life instrument that contains 2 parts: a health status profile and a visual analog scale (VAS) to rate global health-related quality of life. VAS health state scores range from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state). The Mixed Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) analysis was used to calculate Least Squares (LS) mean and standard error. LS mean values are controlled for visit, pooled investigative site, treatment, standard of care (SOC) type, baseline positive symptom stratum, treatment*visit, baseline VAS health state score, and baseline VAS health state score*visit.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to Endpoint in the EuroQol Questionnaire-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Health State Score</title>
          <description>The EQ-5D is a generic, multidimensional, health-related, quality-of-life instrument that contains 2 parts: a health status profile and a visual analog scale (VAS) to rate global health-related quality of life. VAS health state scores range from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state). The Mixed Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) analysis was used to calculate Least Squares (LS) mean and standard error. LS mean values are controlled for visit, pooled investigative site, treatment, standard of care (SOC) type, baseline positive symptom stratum, treatment*visit, baseline VAS health state score, and baseline VAS health state score*visit.</description>
          <population>All randomized participants who received at least one dose of study drug, had a baseline and at least one post-baseline VAS health state measurement.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Endpoint in the Subjective Well-Being Under Neuroleptic Treatment-Short Form (SWN-SF) Total Score</title>
        <description>The SWN-SF measures subjective well-being for the previous 7 days. The 20-item scale covers 5 health domains (subscales; 4 items each): emotional regulation, self-control, mental functioning, social integration, and physical functioning. Individual scores range from 1 (not at all) to 6 (very much). Each of the 5 subscale scores range from 4 to 24. SWN-SF total scores range from 20 to 120. Higher scores indicate greater well-being. The Mixed Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) analysis was used to calculate Least Squares (LS) mean and standard error. LS mean values are controlled for visit, pooled investigative site, treatment, standard of care (SOC) type, baseline positive symptom stratum, treatment*visit, baseline SWN-SF total score, and baseline SWN-SF total score*visit.</description>
