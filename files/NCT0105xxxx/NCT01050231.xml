  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop an upper extremity robotic training system for use by&#xD;
      people with stroke to practice arm and hand movement in the clinic.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each year in the U.S. over 400,000 people survive a stroke and approximately 80% of acute&#xD;
      stroke survivors lose arm and hand movement skills. Movement impairments are typically&#xD;
      treated with intensive, hands-on physical and occupational therapy for several weeks after&#xD;
      the initial brain injury. Unfortunately, due to economic pressure on the U.S. health care&#xD;
      system, stroke patients are receiving less therapy and going home sooner. Our goal for this&#xD;
      study is to develop an upper extremity robotic training system for both acute and chronic&#xD;
      stroke population to improve movement ability with intensive and repetitive movement in the&#xD;
      clinic without continuous supervision from a therapist.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, Post first intervention at 5 weeks, post second intervention at 11 weeks, and 3-month after the completion of the second intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>We measured the Box and Blocks Test scores at baseline evaluation, after each intervention, and at the 3-month follow up evaluation. Participants are instructed to move as many blocks as possible, one at a time, from one compartment in a box to a second compartment over a divider for a period of 60 seconds; each block that is moved is counted, and multiple blocks moved at the same time are counted as a single block. The higher scores indicate a better outcome.</description>

          <description>Robotic group(Type I)&#xD;
Type II Robotic therapy (Individual joints only): Subjects participate in 4 weeks of training with the robotic device BONES, 3 days per week, 1 hour per day with a robot-assisted exercise program. The robotic exoskeleton assists in arm and hand movements focusing on one joint at a time. Then, after one-week of a rest break, all subjects will return to participate in another 4 weeks of training with BONES again, 3 days per week with 1 hour per day, focusing on multi-joint activities such as cleaning the windows, driving a steering wheel, grocery shopping, etc.</description>
