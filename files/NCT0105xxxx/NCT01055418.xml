      This investigation is interested in the effects of high dose vitamin C on endothelial&#xD;
      function in healthy humans. A high fat meal will be utilized to induce endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction. It is hypothesized that, via antioxidant actions, vitamin C will reverse these&#xD;
      effects and in turn improve blood flow- the involvement of nitric oxide suggests that this&#xD;
      could extend to cerebral blood flow. This will be monitored by trans cranial doppler flow&#xD;
      meter and near infrared spectroscopy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The acute effect of administering vitamins has received little research attention. The&#xD;
      exceptions are a number of studies that have observed that single doses of a variety of&#xD;
      vitamins, including Vitamin C, E and several B vitamins, ameliorate endothelial dysfunction&#xD;
      in the periphery in participants who smoke, or suffer disorders such as diabetes mellitus and&#xD;
      cardio-vascular disease. Endothelial function also varies in healthy people as a consequence&#xD;
      of diet, and it is possible that antioxidant vitamins can attenuate the vaso-constriction&#xD;
      associated with commonly consumed foodstuffs. Indeed, a study by Title et al (2000) showed&#xD;
      that vitamin C improved endothelial function in the forearm following a glucose drink. Given&#xD;
      the putative underlying mechanisms involved (e.g. nitric oxide synthesis) any improvement may&#xD;
      well also extend to cerebral blood flow (CBF), and therefore improvements in aspects of&#xD;
      cognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will therefore assess the effects of a single dose of 1000 mg of vitamin C on&#xD;
      cognitive performance and cerebral arterial blood flow velocity (cBFV) using Trans-cranial&#xD;
      Doppler, following a high fat meal that has been used in previous endothelial function&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The high fat meal will be administered 2 hours before testing begins. Research shows that a&#xD;
      meal of this type produces effects on the endothelium which are similar to those induced by&#xD;
      dysfunctions such as diabetes i.e. blood flow restriction. No adverse effects have been&#xD;
      reported with regards this methodology however.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to monitor the effects of vitamin C (or not in the case of placebo) on endothelial&#xD;
      function and cerebral blood flow near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and trans cranial Doppler&#xD;
      (TCD) recordings will be taken throughout (in the case of the former technique) and at&#xD;
      intermittent stages (in the case of the latter). Both neuroimaging modalities, when used&#xD;
      correctly) are entirely safe. Blood pressure readings will also be taken intermittently&#xD;
      throughout testing sessions.&#xD;
