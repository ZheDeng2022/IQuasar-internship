      The UCLA Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Program (adult program) and the UCLA Fit for Healthy&#xD;
      Weight Program (adolescent program) are committed to the care of morbidly obese patients.&#xD;
      This study is observational. The investigators plan to evaluate bariatric surgery outcomes&#xD;
      using the BAROS National Database and also to evaluate quality of life pre- and post&#xD;
      bariatric surgery. In addition, the investigators plan to enroll a subgroup of 10&#xD;
      reproductive-age women to evaluate: 1) pregnancy and offspring health, 2) long-term&#xD;
      nutrition, 3) biomarkers/epigenome, and 4) body-composition/bone-density.&#xD;

      1. National Database: The purpose of the Bariatric Outcomes Longitudinal Database (BOLD)&#xD;
           study is to study the mid- and long-term outcomes of bariatric surgeries and to analyze&#xD;
           the relationship between these outcomes and 1) patient demographics and comorbidities,&#xD;
           2) clinical and surgical characteristics, and 3) pre-operative, peri-operative, and&#xD;
           post-operative care and treatment. The UCLA program will be just one of many&#xD;
           institutions that participate in the BOLD study. Participants include other programs and&#xD;
           surgeons who have received a Full Approval or Provisional Status designation in the&#xD;
           American Society for Bariatric Surgery (ASBS) Bariatric Surgery Center for Excellence&#xD;
           program. This study, along with the database itself, is being established, maintained&#xD;
           and overseen by East Carolina University in association with the Surgical Review&#xD;
           Corporation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Health Survey: The purpose of evaluating physical and mental health is to document&#xD;
           changes that occur following surgery. Standardized surveys will include SF-36,&#xD;
           (Bariatric Analysis and Reporting Outcome System), BAROS, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale.&#xD;
           Our hypothesis is that bariatric surgery will improve quality of life for the majority&#xD;
           of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Reproductive-Age Women:&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the number of bariatric procedures performed has increased to over 200,000 annually,&#xD;
      this number represents only a small fraction of those that qualify. The prevalence of extreme&#xD;
      obesity is higher in women than in men (7% vs. 3%), and women are disproportionately more&#xD;
      likely to undergo bariatric surgery. Nearly 80% of patients undergoing bariatric surgery are&#xD;
      female and 35% are less than 40 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the current demographics of metabolic/bariatric surgery and the epidemic of childhood&#xD;
      obesity, it is important to evaluate the long-term impact of bariatric surgery on nutrition,&#xD;
      pregnancy, offspring health, and bone density. Despite previous concerns, metabolic/bariatric&#xD;
      surgery has been demonstrated to improve maternal outcomes and likely improves neonatal&#xD;
      outcomes. Interestingly, weight-loss surgery has been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of&#xD;
      obesity in offspring by 50%. It is unclear whether improvements in offspring health are&#xD;
      related to changes in the uterine environment, the post-natal environment, or the epigenome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While obesity has been associated with Vitamin D deficiency and hyperparathyroidism, it is&#xD;
      not usually associated with the development of osteoporosis. Bariatric surgery can impair&#xD;
      calcium absorption and exacerbate vitamin deficiencies. However, the impact of surgery on&#xD;
      bone mineral content and density is unclear. This has particular ramifications for young&#xD;
      female patients and the risk of osteoporosis long-term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose is this portion of the study is to evaluate the impact of metabolic/bariatric&#xD;
      surgery on reproductive-age women (age 13 to 30) with respect to weight, nutritional status,&#xD;
      body composition, biomarker/epigenome profile, markers of atherosclerosis, and bone mineral&#xD;
      content/density.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Obstetrical/Offspring Health and Fertility: The purpose of this assessment is to&#xD;
           evaluate the impact of surgery on obstetrical complications, offspring health, and&#xD;
           fertility. A simple questionnaire will be administered to women of reproductive age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Biomarkers /Epigenetic Markers: The purpose of collecting specimens (e.g. blood) and&#xD;
           analyzing changes in hormones, biologic markers, and epigenetic markers is to help&#xD;
           elucidate potential mechanism involved in weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Imaging: In collaboration with Children's Hospital - Los Angeles, we will coordinate&#xD;
           imaging to evaluate body composition, bone density/content, and subclinical markers of&#xD;
           atherosclerosis. Imaging studies will include DEXA (dual x-ray absorptiometry) for&#xD;
           patients under 300 lbs, low-dose CT-scan for patients under 350 lbs, and ultrasound of&#xD;
           the vessels of the neck.&#xD;
