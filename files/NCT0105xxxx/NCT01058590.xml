  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a common disorder in children (2-3%). OSAS in&#xD;
      turn, is associated with significant behavioral, learning, and heart problems.&#xD;
      Adenotonsillectomy (T&amp;A, meaning the removal of tonsils and adenoids) is the most common&#xD;
      treatment for the problem .Diagnosis of OSAS in children is based on overnight&#xD;
      polysomnography (sleep study). Recent studies suggest that upper airway and systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory changes exists in school-age children and adults with OSAS, and that anti&#xD;
      inflammatory therapy can improve respiratory parameters during sleep and reduce adenoid size,&#xD;
      similar to surgery. However, there are no data in the literature on inflammatory changes in&#xD;
      infants with the disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthcare resources utilization, a sensitive marker for diseases is consumed by young&#xD;
      children (&lt;3y) with OSAS more then healthy children, from their first year of life We&#xD;
      hypothesize that infants and young children with OSAS present local inflammatory changes of&#xD;
      the airways as well as systemic inflammation (in the blood or urine) that contribute to the&#xD;
      learning, growing and heart associated medical problems. The Aims of the present study are to&#xD;
      characterize the local and systemic inflammatory changes of young children with OSAS, and to&#xD;
      evaluate their associated medical problems at diagnosis and after therapy (T&amp;A) If indeed&#xD;
      inflammation is &quot;responsible&quot; for the development of OSAS at such a young age it should be&#xD;
      reduced following therapy (i.e. T&amp;A). In such a case bio-markers may become a part of the&#xD;
      algorithms for diagnosis and follow up of such patients.&#xD;

      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To conduct a trial evaluating the effect of Adenonsillectomy in infants (1-36 months of&#xD;
           age), with OSA. Outcome measures will include polysomnographic findings conducted prior&#xD;
           to and 12 weeks following surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify the presence of inflammatory markers (such as, but not only Leukotriene B4,&#xD;
           Leukotriene C4/D4/E4, Isoprostane-8, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and other pro inflammatory&#xD;
           cytokines) in the peripheral blood (prior and after therapy), and urine (Leukotriene&#xD;
           E-4, and others) and correlate their local and systemic expression prior and after&#xD;
           therapy to the magnitude of therapy-associated response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: Two years (initial recruitment will be completed within the initial 12 months&#xD;
      of the study). Assessment of the samples obtained throughout the study will be done at the&#xD;
      latter part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: Soroka University Hospital . The Sleep Laboratory in Soroka UMC, is the only&#xD;
      pediatric one in the city of Beer Sheva and surroundings, evaluates over 1,000 children/year&#xD;
      for a variety of sleep disorders, among which &gt;700 are referred for suspected OSAS, among&#xD;
      them 100 infants&lt; 2 years/ year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All children referred for surgery are admitted in the Dept. of Pediatrics where the PI works.&#xD;
      We intend to approach all the children prior to surgery and offer them to participate in this&#xD;
      study. Those who are interested will gain a sleep study following surgery to validate (or to&#xD;
      rull out) the presence of residual OSA and if there is a need, to continue follow up in the&#xD;
      pediatric sleep outpatient clinic in Soroka UMC.&#xD;

      Serum and urine will be obtained before therapy (T%A) snd 3 months afterwards. The serum will&#xD;
      be stored at -70 throughout the study in the PI's Lab (DR.Goldbart) At the end of the study&#xD;
      the sampled will be assessed for the presence of inflammatory markers (cytokines).&#xD;
