      1. To explore the pathology of nerve, vasculature in the normal control nerve&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare the pathology of control nerve and nerve from amputated limb of diabetes&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic foot occurs in 15% of diabetic population (3) and 15% of the diabetic foot patients&#xD;
      end up with lower limb amputation. Peripheral neuropathy (sensory, motor and autonomic),&#xD;
      peripheral vascular disease, trauma, infection and poor wound healing all contribute to&#xD;
      diabetic foot problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral neuropathy could be evaluated in a variety of ways, including vibratory&#xD;
      thresholds, thermal thresholds, pressure perception thresholds, muscle strength. All these&#xD;
      predict foot ulceration to some degree(1). Motor nerve conduction velocity is an independent&#xD;
      predictor for the development of new foot ulcer in diabetic population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For more detailed structural study of neuropathy in diabetic patient, we could use skin&#xD;
      biopsy method. Skin biopsy with PGP9.5 immunohistochemistry has been demonstrated by&#xD;
      ultrastructural studies to label the terminal portions of both small myelinated and&#xD;
      unmyelinated nerve in the epidermis (5). Intra-epidermal nerve fiber (IENF) density is&#xD;
      reduced in patient with impaired glucose tolerance and clinically overt diabetes (5).&#xD;
      Previous IENF density study was performed in diabetic patients with sensory symptom but no&#xD;
      foot ulcer. Now we tried to evaluate IENF density in severe diabetic foot patient who&#xD;
      received below knee amputation. Skin biopsy will be performed at amputated leg. The skin&#xD;
      biopsy area will be located at lateral side of distal leg, 10 cm above the lateral malleolus&#xD;
      as previous protocol of our group (6). Underlying sural nerve and posterior tibial nerve will&#xD;
      be also harvested for further ultra-structural study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We had previous IRB for &quot;Pathology of skin, nerve and vasculature in the amputated limb of&#xD;
      diabetes&quot;. However, pathology of normal control nerve is important to compare the pathology&#xD;
      of nerve from amputated limb of diabetes. For parotid cancer patients receiving radical&#xD;
      parotidectomy, facial nerve is frequently sacrificed. Sural nerve is frequently harvested for&#xD;
      reconstruction. Sural nerve is also frequently used in ther nerve construction surgery.&#xD;
      During these operations, we could harvested 2 cm more sural nerve for normal nerve pathology&#xD;
      study. For cadaveric donor patient, we also could harvest normal nerve for control study.&#xD;
