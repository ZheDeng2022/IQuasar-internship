      This trial will compare HPV testing to the routine colposcopy in the follow-up of women&#xD;
      treated for cervical high grade lesions. Women will be assigned randomly (by chance) after&#xD;
      treatment of cervical pre-cancer to be either (1) followed-up by colposcopy, or (2) undergo&#xD;
      HPV testing. Women found to have disease by either strategy will be offered re-treatment. For&#xD;
      the next 2 years participants will undergo yearly, in depth, evaluation to assess the cervix&#xD;
      for precancer. We will then be able to compare which of the 2 follow-up strategies worked&#xD;
      best.&#xD;

      Background and rational: Cervical cancer ranks twelfth in terms of cancer mortality in&#xD;
      Canadian women, but remains the second most frequent cancer in Canadian women aged 20-44.&#xD;
      Fortunately, its natural history makes it an ideal candidate for successful prevention.&#xD;
      Cervical cancer and its precursors are caused by a persistent infection of the cervical&#xD;
      epithelium by one of the 15 oncogenic (or high risk) types of human papillomaviruses (HPVs).&#xD;
      The preinvasive changes of cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) can be identified&#xD;
      through cervical cytology (also known as the Pap test). When cellular abnormalities are&#xD;
      identified, women are referred for diagnostic testing. High-grade precursor lesions (CIN2/3)&#xD;
      carry a high risk of progression to invasive cancer and for this reason their treatment is&#xD;
      recommended. Treatment success rates of CIN2/3 are 85%. However, those who fail treatment&#xD;
      need to be identified promptly because their risk of invasive disease is increased more then&#xD;
      10 fold. The current strategy used in Canada to identify treatment failures consists of a&#xD;
      follow-up every 6 months in colposcopy clinics for 2 years. Recent research underlines the&#xD;
      fact that routine colposcopy is unreliable and may miss significant lesions. The&#xD;
      identification of oncogenic HPV DNA in the cervical secretions is known as HPV testing. A few&#xD;
      studies have investigated the use of HPV testing in the identification of treatment failures.&#xD;
      Although they point to a very good sensitivity (90-95%) there were methodological&#xD;
      limitations: studies were small; the HPV test used was often not suitable for clinical&#xD;
      laboratory use; endpoints were not assessed by histological confirmation. Most importantly,&#xD;
      none compared HPV testing to colposcopy, the strategy used in Canada. Research question: Is&#xD;
      HPV testing more sensitive than routine colposcopy to identify CIN2/3 treatment failures?&#xD;
      Methodology: Design: We propose a parallel randomized controlled trial, where participants&#xD;
      will be randomized 1:1 to routine colposcopy vs. HPV testing after treatment of CIN2/3&#xD;
      lesions. Study Population: Women treated for high-grade precursor lesions. Exclusion criteria&#xD;
      are: pregnancy, less than 18 years of age, known immunosuppression or immunodeficiency,&#xD;
      unable to provide informed consent. Study interventions: (1) HPV testing with Hybrid Capture&#xD;
      2. (2) Routine colposcopy. In order to evaluate the performance of the current follow-up&#xD;
      strategy, there will be no standardized protocol for the colposcopy intervention, but&#xD;
      documentation of procedures will be done. Patients will receive the study interventions 6&#xD;
      months after treatment. All participants will undergo expert diagnostic assessment at 12 and&#xD;
      24. Sample size calculation and recruitment rate. The sample size was calculated to have 80%&#xD;
      power to detect an increase in sensitivity of 15%, with an alpha set at 0.05 (double sided&#xD;
      test). Assuming a conservative baseline sensitivity of 70% for colposcopy, 134 cases of&#xD;
      recurrent/persistent disease will be necessary in each study group. Assuming a 15% failure&#xD;
      rate of treatment and a 20% drop out rate, a total of 2250 participants will need to be&#xD;
      accrued. Recruitment will take place in high volume colposcopy clinics across Canada over 2&#xD;
      years. Analysis: The primary analysis will consist of the comparison of the diagnostic&#xD;
      indices of the 2 follow-up strategies: sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative&#xD;
      predictive values (with their 95% asymptotic confidence intervals). Cumulative&#xD;
      persistent/recurrent cases identified during the 2 year follow-up will make up the case&#xD;
      group. Since all participants will undergo expert diagnostic assessment. No subgroup analysis&#xD;
      will be performed. 4. Expected contribution: The result from this trial will provide high&#xD;
      quality data on which to base management recommendation. If HPV testing is found to be more&#xD;
      sensitive than routine colposcopy, follow-up of treated lesion may occur mainly in primary&#xD;
      care physician's office with HPV testing, reducing costs, and making it possible to focus&#xD;
      colposcopy activities on a group of women truly at risk of significant disease.&#xD;
