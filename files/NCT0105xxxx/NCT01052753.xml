  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ultimate goal of this study is to find specific polymorphism of candidate genes&#xD;
      (particularly of dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems) associated with intermediate&#xD;
      phenotypes (e.g., executive functions, IQ, and other neuropsychological function) and/or&#xD;
      phenomenological phenotypes (subtypes, comorbidity, dimensional approach) of ADHD. We propose&#xD;
      to replicate the analysis of the candidate genes identified by previous genetic studies and&#xD;
      recent findings from GWAS on ADHD using the candidate gene association study design&#xD;
      (family-based case control study using parental controls and population-based case-control&#xD;
      study). These results may lead our research team: (1) to resolve controversies over&#xD;
      inconsistent findings in previous genetic studies and contribute to the literature on the&#xD;
      validity of ADHD and its subtypes using clinical and genetic data; (2) to identify potential&#xD;
      endophenotypes for ADHD genetic studies; and (3) to identify specific polymorphism of&#xD;
      candidate genes and gene expressions of dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems associated&#xD;
      with executive functions measured by the CANTAB.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common, impairing, highly heritable,&#xD;
      clinically heterogeneous early-onset neuropsychiatric disorder. Despite substantial evidence&#xD;
      supporting genetic etiology of ADHD, molecular genetic studies so far have not yet provided&#xD;
      any conclusive results using the categorical or subgroup approach of phenotype. Hence, there&#xD;
      has been growing interest in using endophenotypes in molecular genetic studies on ADHD. Our&#xD;
      previous studies have demonstrated significant deficits in executive functions among children&#xD;
      with ADHD and the efficacy of methylphenidate and atomoxetine, involving dopaminergic and&#xD;
      noradrenergic systems, in reducing ADHD core symptoms and improving executive functions. In a&#xD;
      longitudinal follow-up family study on ADHD, we also reported that executive dysfunctions&#xD;
      measured by the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Batteries (CANTAB) are potential&#xD;
      endophenotypes for ADHD. Hence, identifying specific polymorphism of candidate genes of&#xD;
      dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems associated with executive dysfunctions in Han Chinese&#xD;
      in Taiwan is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To identify specific genetic polymorphism of candidate genes of dopaminergic and&#xD;
           noradrenergic systems (e.g., DRD2, DRD4, DRD5, DAT1, NET, ADRA2A, DBH, COMT etc.)&#xD;
           associated with executive dysfunctions measured by the CANTAB and other alternative&#xD;
           phenotype approaches (ADHD subtypes, comorbidities, treatment effects, IQ, symptom&#xD;
           dimensions and severity);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to investigate the relationship between a variety of ADHD phenotypes and endophenotypes&#xD;
           and gene expressions of DRD2, DAT1, NET, ADRA2A, DBH, and COMT;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to validate executive functions and to search for other neuropsychological functioning&#xD;
           as endophenotypes for ADHD; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to determine whether ADHD is familial and identify which core symptoms of ADHD and which&#xD;
           component of neuropsychological functioning are most familial;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects and Methods: The major study design is the family-based case-control candidate gene&#xD;
      association study. We will recruit 150 probands with ADHD, aged 7-18, and their parents (n =&#xD;
      300) and siblings (n= 150) and 150 school controls in three years (50, 60, and 40 families&#xD;
      with ADHD and 50, 60, 40 school controls in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd year, respectively). The&#xD;
      measures include (1) interviews for psychopathology (K-SADS-E) and social functioning&#xD;
      (SAICA), (2) self-administered questionnaires to measures ADHD symptoms (CPRS-R:S, CTRS-R:S,&#xD;
      SNAP-IV and Adult ADHD rating scale) and comorbid conditions (ASRI and CBCL), and (3)&#xD;
      neuropsychological tests: WISC-III-R, CPT, CANTAB, and Time Perception Tasks. The&#xD;
      transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT) and quantitative TDT by using FBAT and FBAT-GEE, GEE,&#xD;
      and Mixed Models will be used for data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated Results: We anticipate the establishment of clinical, neuropsychological, and&#xD;
      genetic database of at least 350 families (150 families in this project) and 150 same-age&#xD;
      controls, the completion of genetic analysis and gene expressions of several candidate genes&#xD;
      including those involving dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems, and identification of&#xD;
      genetic variants for ADHD diagnosis, symptoms, and comorbidities, executive functions, and&#xD;
      other neurocognitive endophenotypes in a Taiwanese sample. The findings of different&#xD;
      approaches to identify the genetic etiologies for ADHD in this study should help us determine&#xD;
      the most promising approach for future molecular genetic studies on ADHD.&#xD;

        The proband sample will consist of at least 150 drug-na√Øve children and adolescents with&#xD;
        ADHD, aged 7-18 (who are able to perform the CANTAB and time tasks) from Department of&#xD;
        Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH). Their biological parents (n = 300)&#xD;
        and siblings (estimated number = 150) born to the same biological parents will be recruited&#xD;
        as the parent controls and sibling controls, respectively, for the family-based case&#xD;
        control study. We will recruit 150 school controls without lifetime diagnosis of ADHD in&#xD;
        the same school districts and with similar age and gender distributions of the probands&#xD;
        with ADHD.&#xD;
