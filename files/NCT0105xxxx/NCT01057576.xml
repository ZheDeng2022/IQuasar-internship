    <textblock>
      Specific compounds in plants have been proposed to enhance human metabolism. The hypothesis&#xD;
      of the study was to evaluated the effect of an extract of Russian tarragon and to determine&#xD;
      is compounds in the plant can be measured in the serum of human subjects and whether the&#xD;
      compound may improve human metabolism as suggested in animal studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Artemisia dracunculus L., often called Russian tarragon, is a wild specie and a close&#xD;
      relative of common cooking tarragon (known as French tarragon or Artemisia dracunculus sativa&#xD;
      or dracunculoides). Artemisia and, more specifically, Artemisia dracunculus, have a storied&#xD;
      history of medicinal use in humans, particularly for treatment of diabetes. The Artemisia&#xD;
      dracunculus extract described in this project as PMI-5011 was originally identified from a&#xD;
      screening of extracts for hypoglycemic activity in diabetic mice as the most promising&#xD;
      candidate for the development of a nutritional supplement for diabetes. The active compounds&#xD;
      in the preparation are believed to be members of the sesquiterpene, lactone or flavanoid&#xD;
      groups, of which the Artemisia family is well known. Preliminary data from our laboratory&#xD;
      suggests that PMI-5011 may have significant effects to improve carbohydrate metabolism by&#xD;
      enhancing molecular events of insulin action in skeletal muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PMI-5011 is an herbal botanical dietary supplement prepared from Artemisia dracunculus L.&#xD;
      (Russian Tarragon) to help maintain normal blood glucose concentrations. PMI-5011 is an&#xD;
      ethanolic extract from fresh herb grown in standardized hydroponic conditions for maximum&#xD;
      consistency and nutritional content. Artemisia is a large family of herbs with a rich history&#xD;
      of safe medicinal and culinary use. PMI-5011 is able to significantly decrease blood glucose&#xD;
      concentrations in Streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice and in genetically diabetic KK-Ay&#xD;
      mice. The preparation does not, however, decrease blood glucose concentrations in&#xD;
      non-diabetic mice or rats. The historical use of the plant and its extract suggest that it is&#xD;
      safe and its non-toxicity has been confirmed with acute and chronic toxicity studies and&#xD;
      non-mutagenicity confirmed with AMES testing. PMI-5011 may have several modes of action&#xD;
      leading to its ability to decrease blood glucose concentrations in diabetic animals,&#xD;
      suggesting it is comprised of several different nutrients that act synergistically. Some in&#xD;
      vitro activities of PMI-5011 include the modulation of GLP-1 binding to its receptor and the&#xD;
      stimulation of insulin-mediated glucose uptake into cultured skeletal muscle cells. PMI-5011&#xD;
      also decreases the expression of PEPCK in the liver of diabetic animals and may decrease&#xD;
      hepatic glucose output as a result. Recently, in an in vitro assay identified that PMI 5011&#xD;
      may have potent effects to reduce phosphastase activities and thereby promote insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of a high does of PMI 5011 in&#xD;
      obese insulin resistant, yet non-diabetic subjects. The study is a double-blind, randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, pilot study in which subjects will be randomized to receive either&#xD;
      placebo or PMI-5011 (4 500mg caps/TID) for a total of 3 weeks of treatment. Each subject will&#xD;
      continue on the same dosage of PMI-5011 or matching placebo for the entire duration of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this pilot trial, a precise technique (hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps) will be used&#xD;
      to assess insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
