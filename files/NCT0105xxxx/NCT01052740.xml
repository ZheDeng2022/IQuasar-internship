      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  X-ray mammography is the standard method for breast cancer screening. It is a&#xD;
           noninvasive test using x-rays to take pictures of breast tissue and detect any&#xD;
           abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center has a breast imaging unit that&#xD;
           has been accredited by the American College of Radiology. To maintain accreditation, the&#xD;
           unit must recruit a certain number of women to have clinical mammograms each year in&#xD;
           order to maintain a high level of clinical skills and experience for the radiologists&#xD;
           and technologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To create a state-of-the-art mammography unit at the NIH Clinical Center in order to&#xD;
      maintain American College of Radiology accreditation of the NIH breast imaging facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Women who are eligible for breast cancer screening because of family cancer history,&#xD;
      genetic test results, or previous instances of cancer. Participants may not be pregnant or&#xD;
      nursing at the time of the screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide a brief medical history on arrival at the NIH breast imaging&#xD;
           unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each participant will have a standard mammogram performed by a radiology technician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the study is normal, participants will be told that no further evaluation will be&#xD;
           performed. If the results indicate a need for further imaging or tissue biopsy,&#xD;
           participants may elect to return to the care of their primary physician or to receive&#xD;
           further follow-up at the NIH Clinical Center.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mammography facility in the Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is&#xD;
      present in order to facilitate breast cancer research programs. The American College of&#xD;
      Radiology mammography accreditation program (1992 mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA)&#xD;
      (1-3)) has established national standards for site accreditation for mammography. A key&#xD;
      requirement is to perform a minimum number of mammography examinations in the facility per&#xD;
      year. Minimum examination volumes are required to maintain expertise of the facility staff&#xD;
      for maintaining facility accreditation and compliance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#xD;
      requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary aim is a protocol to maintain accreditation of the NIH breast imaging facility in&#xD;
      the Clinical Center of NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who are clinically indicated for screening mammography according to the National&#xD;
      Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines (3) and the American Cancer Society&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standard of care protocol to perform standard clinically indicated mammography exams. We&#xD;
      are expected to recruit 1000 patient /year.&#xD;
