      A prospective observational study in which pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters are&#xD;
      evaluated in a cohort of patients with NTM diseases.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NTM are widely distributed in the environment and can especially be found in soil and water&#xD;
      sources. These bacteria a very similar to tuberculosis bacteria. We are not that long aware&#xD;
      that these bacteria can cause illness. Especially in patients with a chronic lung disease are&#xD;
      sensitive to these bacteria and are susceptible to develop an infection. A lot of ambiguity&#xD;
      consists about the best treatment of these infections. Up till now mainly the normal&#xD;
      treatment for tuberculosis is used, however, the time period during which these medicines&#xD;
      should be used and what dose should be used is mainly unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate whether the dose used at this moment is right a pharmacokinetic curve will be&#xD;
      taken at steady-state.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  currently treated for NTM infection or recently diagnosed with NTM infection starting&#xD;
             treatment at University Centre for Chronic Diseases Dekkerswald (Groesbeek), Centre&#xD;
             for Revalidation Beatrixoord (Haren), or other outpatient clinics in The Netherlands.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis and treatment according to American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria for NTM&#xD;
             infections. Patients with pulmonary NTM infections (possible with extrapulmonary&#xD;
             localizations as well) are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treated with at least rifampicin and ethambutol and optionally with isoniazid,&#xD;
             clarithromycin or azithromycin on a daily basis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age at least 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has been using drugs for at least two weeks when steady state concentrations&#xD;
             of the used drugs are expected&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Informed consent has been signed&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The medical state of the patients does not allow inclusion according to the physician&#xD;
             in attendance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patients' clinical parameters urge immediate cessation of drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant hepatic or renal dysfunction based on chemistry parameters (grade 1&#xD;
             according to an international adverse event grading system, see http:/ctep.cancer.gov)&#xD;
             or symptomatic liver dysfunction (nausea and vomiting).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with cystic fibrosis, since these show deviating pharmacokinetics for many&#xD;
             drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with HIV infection, since these may show deviating pharmacokinetics for the&#xD;
             drugs used in NTM disease.&#xD;
