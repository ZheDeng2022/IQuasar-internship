  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exenatide acutely inhibits intestinal lipoprotein particle production. We are unable to&#xD;
      speculate whether exenatide affects hepatic lipoprotein production in humans since there is&#xD;
      currently no evidence from animal models or in vitro studies that have demonstrated an effect&#xD;

      Subjects will receive an infusion of stable isotope enriched acetate, leucine and a bolus of&#xD;
      glycerol in order to measure the rates of fatty acid synthesis, apolipoprotein and&#xD;
      triglyceride turnover respectively. This in vivo stable isotope enrichment methodology has&#xD;
      been widely established and used by investigators around the world for more than 30 years to&#xD;
      examine the metabolism of various metabolites in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following an overnight fast, at approximately 9am on day 1 of the study the subject will be&#xD;
      admitted to hospital and will have a 30ml fasting blood sample drawn for analysis of plasma&#xD;
      glucose, total plasma cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), free&#xD;
      fatty acids (FFA), insulin, GLP-1, growth hormone, glucagon, stable isotope enrichment and a&#xD;
      more detailed analysis of triglyceride rich lipoprotein (TRL) composition (lipid and&#xD;
      apolipoprotein content). A radio-opaque polyvinyl feeding tube (Entriflex NG Tube 55''&#xD;
      [140cm] 10fr Item # 8884721055, Kendall Products, Tyco Healthcare, Toronto, ON) will be&#xD;
      inserted through the nose into the stomach, with enough length provided for migration of the&#xD;
      tip into the duodenum. The subject will be administered 10 mg metoclopramide orally to&#xD;
      facilitate transport of the tip of the tube into the duodenum. The subject will be allowed to&#xD;
      eat regular meals during the day but will fast overnight after 7pm and will remain fasting&#xD;
      for the duration of the study. Water ad lib will be allowed. At approximately 3pm on day 1 an&#xD;
      abdominal X-Ray will confirm the position of the tube in the duodenum. At 4pm 2 iv's will be&#xD;
      inserted into a superficial vein in each forearm, one for infusion and one for sampling. An&#xD;
      infusion of 1-13C acetate (15 gm in a bag of ½ N saline at 32ml/hr) will begin after the iv's&#xD;
      have been inserted and will be infused for the remainder of the study, which is 27 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting at 4am a synthetic triglyceride emulsion, Intralipid (20% solution, Baxter Canada) ,&#xD;
      will be infused through the feeding tube into the duodenum at a rate of 40 ml/hr for the&#xD;
      duration of the experiment (ie until 7pm that evening). This will provide a steady state fed&#xD;
      state for the subsequent assessment of lipoprotein turnover kinetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will receive, in random order, either exenatide 10 mg or equivalent volume of&#xD;
      saline subcutaneously at 7am on day 2 of the hospitalization (i.e. at -2hr) during the first&#xD;
      of the two studies. The pancreatic clamp will begin at 7am (-2hr), immediately following&#xD;
      administration of either exenatide or saline and continue throughout the subsequent 12 hours&#xD;
      (until 7pm). . During the pancreatic clamp the subjects will receive an iv infusion of&#xD;
      glucagon (0.65ng/kg/min), growth hormone (Humatrope, 3.0 ng/kg/min), somatostatin&#xD;
      (sandostatin, 25 µg/hr) and insulin (Novolin R, 0.05 mU/kg/min).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 9 am (we will refer to this time point as 0hr of the lipoprotein turnover study), the&#xD;
      lipoprotein turnover study will begin. An iv bolus of deuterated-glycerol (d5-glycerol, 75&#xD;
      mmol/kg) will be administered, followed by a primed-constant infusion of deuterated leucine;&#xD;
      d3-leucine, (10 mmol/kg bolus followed by 10 mmol/kg/hr for 10 hours). Blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected prior to and at regular time intervals for 10 hours after the iv bolus of&#xD;
      d3-glycerol and start of the constant infusion of d3-leucine (for assessment of lipoprotein&#xD;
      kinetics). Blood samples will be collected prior to (30ml at -2hr, 10ml at -1hr and 30ml at&#xD;
      0hr) and 5min and 15min (10ml each) and then 30ml each at 30min, 1hr, 2hr, 3hr, 4hr, 5hr, 6hr&#xD;
      (only 10ml),7hr, 8hr, 9hr and 10hr after administration of d5-glycerol and start of&#xD;
      d3-leucine infusion.&#xD;
