  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been associated with HIV infection. However, it is uncertain&#xD;
      whether increased CVD rates are associated with HIV-related factors (e.g., HIV-infection or&#xD;
      highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) may worsen dyslipidemia) or reflect differences&#xD;
      in the prevalence of underlying risk factors for CVD. Furthermore, the association between&#xD;
      initiation and duration of HAART exposure and CVD risk, including which specific drugs within&#xD;
      the HAART classes may contribute to the increased risk, is unknown. The primary objectives of&#xD;
      the study are therefore:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To estimate the absolute and relative incidence rate (IR) of CVD claims-based diagnoses&#xD;
      among a cohort of adult patients from a large managed care population with a claims diagnosis&#xD;
      of HIV, AIDS, or AIDS-related complex (ARC) during periods of exposure to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any HAART compared to no HAART exposure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HAART class [i.e., NRTIs, NNRTIs, PIs, and Other (i.e., fusion inhibitors)] compared to&#xD;
           no HAART class exposure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific NRTI medications compared to no specific NRTI exposure&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The scientific approach is to conduct a retrospective cohort study of patients with a claims&#xD;
      diagnosis of HIV, AIDS, or ARC (simply referred to as HIV infection) among commercially&#xD;
      insured people in the U.S. to estimate the IR of acute MI (AMI), AMI including coronary&#xD;
      revascularization (CR) procedures, and CVD, comparing exposure to HAART treatments. We will&#xD;
      identify a primary cohort of patients with an initial claims diagnosis of HIV infection&#xD;
      occurring after at least 6 months of continuous enrollment in the Ingenix National Health&#xD;
      Informatics (NHI) or Ingenix Impact National Managed Care (Impact) Databases between 01&#xD;
      January 1998 and 31 December 2007. For each eligible primary cohort member, we will identify&#xD;
      all HAART dispensings during the baseline and follow-up periods and categorize person-time of&#xD;
      exposure by any HAART, HAART class, and specific NRTI medications. We will also specifically&#xD;
      evaluate the risk associated with fosamprenavir and amprenavir use. Study outcome events,&#xD;
      including AMI, AMI including CR procedures, and CVD, will be identified from the medical&#xD;
      claims data for all patients during the follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the primary analysis, we will estimate the absolute IR and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)&#xD;
      of each study outcome event during periods of recent, past, non-use, and cumulative duration&#xD;
      (non-use, &lt; 1 year, 1 - 2 years, and &gt; 2 years) of each HAART exposure classification. We&#xD;
      will also estimate the rate difference (RD) and 95% CI of each study outcome event during&#xD;
      periods of recent, past, and cumulative duration (&lt; 1 year, 1 - 2 years, and &gt; 2 years) of&#xD;
      each HAART exposure classification relative to non-use. We will use Poisson regression models&#xD;
      to estimate the multivariable adjusted rate ratio (RR) and 95% CIs of each study outcome&#xD;
      event during periods of recent, past, and cumulative duration (non-use, &lt; 1 year, 1 - 2&#xD;
      years, and &gt; 2 years) of HAART use relative to non-use for each HAART exposure&#xD;
      classification, adjusting for confounding variables derived from the claims history of each&#xD;
      person during their 6-month baseline period to account for channeling bias and during the&#xD;
      follow-up period to account for changing risk factors for CVD. To further account for&#xD;
      confounding of indication by abacavir use, analyses will be stratified by calendar year 2004,&#xD;
      during which time there was a significant change in the primary indication for abacavir use&#xD;
      in HIV. Analyses will be repeated as a secondary analysis on the subgroup of patients in the&#xD;
      NHI Database with any outpatient laboratory test result; these analyses will account for&#xD;
      values of cholesterol, cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) count, and viral load [HIV-1&#xD;
      ribonucleic acid (RNA)] laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the primary cohort, we will identify a subcohort of patients with an initial claims&#xD;
      diagnosis of HIV infection occurring after at least 6 months of continuous enrollment and&#xD;
      without HAART medication in the 6-month baseline period prior to the cohort entry date. We&#xD;
      will repeat the primary and secondary analyses among this na誰ve subcohort of HAART&#xD;
      initiators.&#xD;

      updating systems to reflect the change in sponsorship.&#xD;

        Source population is from the proprietary Ingenix NHI Database, a large, geographically&#xD;
        diverse population of U.S. health insurance plan enrollees. Records are organized into a&#xD;
        medical file containing claims from providers and facilities, a pharmacy file with&#xD;
        outpatient pharmacy dispensing records, and an enrollment file that provides demographic&#xD;
        data and dates of insurance eligibility for persons in the database. Laboratory test&#xD;
        results are also available for a fraction of the population. In addition, i3 Drug Safety&#xD;
        will complement the data from the NHI Database with data from the Ingenix National Managed&#xD;
        Care (Impact) Database, a fully de-identified, HIPAA compliant database from health&#xD;
        insurance claims and enrollment data of more than 30 health plans separate from the plan&#xD;
        affiliated with the NHI Database. Patients in each data source have a common unique&#xD;
        identifier; therefore, it is possible to construct a combined population without concern&#xD;
        that some patients may be duplicated.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients aged 18 years or older with an initial claims diagnosis of HIV infection&#xD;
             associated with a physician visit occurring after at least 6 months (183 days) of&#xD;
             continuous enrollment between 01 January 1998 and 31 December 2007 will be included in&#xD;
             the primary cohort. Patients will be required to have commercial health insurance&#xD;
             coverage and complete medical and pharmacy benefits. The cohort entry date for each&#xD;
             patient will be limited to the first claim associated with a HIV infection diagnosis&#xD;
             that meets the 6-month continuous enrollment criteria. Patients with a HIV infection&#xD;
             diagnosis claim who do not have at least one continuously enrolled segment that is&#xD;
             equal to or greater than 6 months prior to the cohort entry date will be excluded. Six&#xD;
             months of continuous enrollment prior to the initial claim associated with a HIV&#xD;
             infection diagnosis will be required to guarantee the availability of a 6-month&#xD;
             baseline period for ascertaining exposure to HAART prior to cohort entry and&#xD;
             covariates of interest for the Poisson regression models. Patients may enter the&#xD;
             primary cohort already exposed to HAART and with a HIV infection diagnosis claim in&#xD;
             the 6-month baseline period.&#xD;
