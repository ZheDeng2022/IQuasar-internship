      The purpose of this study is to determine if non-invasive salivary genetic screening of&#xD;
      breastfeeding mothers taking codeine will allow for the successful identification of&#xD;
      mother-infant pairs susceptible to adverse events and to prevent these adverse events by&#xD;
      personalizing their medication to their genetics.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Currently, the opioid analgesic codeine is commonly administered to breastfeeding mothers&#xD;
      after Caesarean section for pain relief. Codeine was originally considered safe to use while&#xD;
      breastfeeding however, increased risk of adverse drug reactions has been demonstrated in&#xD;
      mothers taking codeine, as well as their breastfed infants, when the mother possesses a&#xD;
      genetic variation resulting in cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) ultra-rapid metabolizer (UM)&#xD;
      phenotype. On average, most people convert about 10-15% of their codeine dose to morphine&#xD;
      resulting in pain relief however, UM individuals can convert up to 50% of their codeine doses&#xD;
      into active morphine. As many as 4% of North Americans may be UMs and these mothers and their&#xD;
      breastfed infants are at high risk of serious adverse events despite &quot;safe&quot; codeine dosing&#xD;
      due to morphine overproduction and accumulation in the mother and her breast milk. Observed&#xD;
      side effects include severe sedation, decreased rate and depth of breathing and even infant&#xD;
      death. In response to this problem, our hospital-based clinical trial strives to identify&#xD;
      at-risk UM mother-infant pairs by performing a genetic test on non-invasive, voluntary saliva&#xD;
      samples from mothers giving birth by Caesarean section and who will need codeine for pain&#xD;
      relief while breastfeeding. We believe that this test will allow us to reliably identify&#xD;
      at-risk UM mother-infant pairs and prevent adverse drug reactions in both by tailoring&#xD;
      analgesic therapy to their genetic results: mothers identified as being UMs will be given&#xD;
      other suitable analgesics, such as ibuprofen, in place of codeine-containing preparations. We&#xD;
      propose that this prospective study will generate high-level data supporting the&#xD;
      cost-effective genetic screening of mothers who will be taking codeine while breastfeeding&#xD;
      before they begin taking their medications. Such testing is currently possible on a&#xD;
      nation-wide scale through collaboration with the Canadian Pharmacogenomics Network for Drug&#xD;
      Safety (CPNDS).&#xD;
