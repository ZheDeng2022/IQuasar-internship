    <textblock>
      The purpose of this compassionate use study is to provide clinical and technical support of&#xD;
      the Bion® microstimulator system to the subjects who have decided to keep the system for&#xD;
      relief of headache symptoms that have not responded to medical treatment. These study&#xD;
      subjects were enrolled and implanted with the Bion® system during a previous clinical&#xD;
      investigation of the Bion® for occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) in the United States.&#xD;
