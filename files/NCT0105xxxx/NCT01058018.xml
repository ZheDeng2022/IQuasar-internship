      subjects with stable coronary artery disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One-third of the US population, almost 80 million adults, have cardiovascular disease and&#xD;
      mortality associated with heart disease still remains as a leading cause of death around the&#xD;
      world. The major risk factors for cardiovascular disease associated with atherosclerosis is&#xD;
      dyslipidemia, characterized by high levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) and/or low levels&#xD;
      of high density lipoprotein (HDL). The widespread use of statins in patients at risk for&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease has led to lower LDL levels but has had little effect on HDL levels.&#xD;
      HDL has a well established role in atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease protection. HDL&#xD;
      mediates the removal of cholesterol from the atherosclerotic plaques for elimination from the&#xD;
      body. The cardioprotective component of HDL consists of apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1). Recent&#xD;
      intervention studies with synthetic HDL particles and recombinant ApoA1 have shown that HDL&#xD;
      has the capacity to reverse coronary atherosclerosis. Increasing ApoA1 is likely to have a&#xD;
      favorable effect on atherosclerotic plaque size and stability, and on cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases. RVX000222 is a member of a novel class of small molecules that are candidates for&#xD;
      the treatment of dyslipidemia by increasing plasma levels of HDL through increased ApoA1&#xD;
      transcription.&#xD;
