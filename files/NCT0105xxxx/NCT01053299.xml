  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All newborn from the period 12.1988 to 31.12.2006 During the two last decades, hip ultrasound&#xD;
      has gained acceptance as an accurate screening test for developmental dysplasia of the hip&#xD;
      (DDH) and for monitoring the development and treatment of the condition. Debate continues&#xD;
      over whether DDH that is detected by ultrasonography is necessarily clinically relevant. The&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound imaging for DDH in the screening population has not been&#xD;
      investigated adequately. Studies that investigate the natural course of the disorder, the&#xD;
      optimal treatment for DDH, and the best strategy for ultrasound screening are needed.&#xD;
      Ultrasound screening at birth for DDH in all newborn infants is standard practice in some&#xD;
      European countries but not in the United Kingdom, the United States, or Scandinavia. Evidence&#xD;
      is insufficient to support or reject general ultrasound screening of newborns for DDH.&#xD;
      (N.F.Woolacott etc 2006, systematic review BMJ) At Vestre Viken HF, Kongsberg, Norway, the&#xD;
      investigators implemented universal ultrasound screening in 1998. We will present the long&#xD;
      term outcome, including radiographs of the hips after 5-12 years.&#xD;

      All the newborn from the period 1.2.1988 to 31.12.2006 will be called for to take an AP X-ray&#xD;
      of the pelvis for assessment of their hips. The data compares to the primary&#xD;
      ultrasound-recordings taken newborn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographs of the pelvis: The x-ray examinations will be performed using low-dose technique.&#xD;
      Scrotal lead shield will be used in boys, and the girls will be examined during a menstrual&#xD;
      period to exclude pregnancy. The examination will include an erect AP view (feet pointing&#xD;
      forward, neutral ab-adduction position of the hips) using a film/focus distance of 1.2 m and&#xD;
      centred at 2cm proximal to the pubic bone. To standardise the projection, a rotation index&#xD;
      between 0.7 and 1.8 (49;50) will be required. Repeat images will be avoided. A tubing&#xD;
      containing a contrast medium will be placed in the x-ray field to give the true horizontal&#xD;
      level for measurements of leg length discrepancy. The assessment of the images will be done&#xD;
      by a specialist in pediatric radiology in another hospital, and blinded for the primary&#xD;
      ultrasound-results. In cases of pathology, the patient will be scheduled for an urgent&#xD;
      appointment with a paediatric orthopaedic surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Image analysis: the following measurements will be performed using a validated digitising&#xD;
      program (Pedersen et al, J Pediatric Orthopedic 2004):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Markers for DDH:&#xD;
&#xD;
           CE (centre-edge) angle of Wiberg, Refined CE angle (Ogata) Sharp's angle ADR (the&#xD;
           acetabular depth ratio, Murray) FHEI (femoral head extrusion index, Heyman and Herndon)&#xD;
           The shape of the lateral acetabulum (subjective assessment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Markers for previous avascular necrosis (AVN)&#xD;
&#xD;
      AP:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Femoral head shape (classified as spherical, mildly flattened or flattened). Caput -&#xD;
      trochanter height Projected CCD angle Length and width of the femoral neck (Shape of the&#xD;
      physis) Leg length (Trendelenburg) In addition Body Mass Index (BMI) for itch child will be&#xD;
      calculated.&#xD;
