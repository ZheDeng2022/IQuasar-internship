      This study is designed to assess the impact of new approaches to therapy for paracetamol&#xD;
      poisoning. Standard therapy is currently acetylcysteine by intravenous infusion over 20.25h.&#xD;
      This regimen is given to those deemed &quot;at risk&quot; using standard criteria (British National&#xD;
      Formulary 200920). It has 3 major problems, adverse events (nausea and vomiting and&#xD;
      anaphylactoid reactions), therapy duration and complexity of administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is primarily designed to test the efficacy of prophylactic anti-emetic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will also provide sufficient experience and data from a modified shortened IV&#xD;
      acetylcysteine regimen to adequately design and power a study of the modified regimen as a&#xD;
      new treatment for this common poison. Such an approach has a major potential to reduce&#xD;
      patient adverse events from acetylcysteine therapy and shorten duration of hospital stay.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Paracetamol is the commonest poison seen in the United Kingdom and is present in&#xD;
      approximately 40% of patients admitted with self harm. Current treatment involves use of the&#xD;
      antidote acetylcysteine in patients deemed at risk of potential liver damage. This is given&#xD;
      by intravenous infusion over a period of 20.25 hours. This regimen was designed in the 1970s&#xD;
      and is empirical, in that a large loading dose of the antidote is administered followed by 2&#xD;
      decreasing concentrations. It is cumbersome to calculate and dilute within the ward and&#xD;
      therefore subject to error in preparation. The initial infusion is associated with a&#xD;
      significant rate of adverse reactions, in particular nausea and vomiting and anaphylactoid&#xD;
      reactions. The latter are particularly troublesome and occur in up to 15% of patients&#xD;
      treated. Therapy is discontinued and there is often confusion as to whether it can be&#xD;
      restarted in a timely manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studying antidotes in the management of poisoning is challenging not least because of the&#xD;
      patient population and of the limited time available to make decisions and gain consent. This&#xD;
      will be the first major clinical trial of antidote therapy in this poisoning in the UK in 30&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final objective of this work is to develop a therapeutic regimen of acetylcysteine that&#xD;
      does not cause such a high rate of adverse reactions and is also easier for nurses to make&#xD;
      up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study focuses on the potential use of ondansetron, an anti-emetic, prior to the&#xD;
      administration of acetylcysteine. It will also allow preliminary data to be collected on a&#xD;
      new approach to giving acetylcysteine using a modified 12 h regimen, which includes a slower&#xD;
      initial intravenous infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary trial outcome will therefore inform on the efficacy of ondansetron pre-treatment&#xD;
      as an anti-emetic in this situation. In addition valuable data on the incidence of adverse&#xD;
      effects caused by the modified acetylcysteine regimen, and changes in liver function and the&#xD;
      inflammatory response to paracetamol liver injury caused by paracetamol within this modified&#xD;
      acetylcysteine treatment will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition an opportunity will be taken in a convenience sample of 40 patients to study the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of acetylcysteine in this group using the standard and modified regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A factorial design is being used to answer the key clinical questions. In total a maximum of&#xD;
      250 patients will be recruited and it is anticipated the data from 200 will be available for&#xD;
      final analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The demographic of this patient group is essentially Caucasian English-speaking and at this&#xD;
      stage we do not propose to recruit non-English-speaking subjects.&#xD;
