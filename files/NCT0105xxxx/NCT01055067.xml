    <measure>Best Overall Response and Objective Response Rate Following Treatment With Tivantinib (ARQ 197) in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Germ Cell Tumors</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to first objective response, up to 1 year 9 months postdose</time_frame>
    <description>The best overall response was the best response (in the order of confirmed complete response [CR], confirmed partial response [PR], unconfirmed CR, unconfirmed PR, stable disease [SD], and progressive disease [PD]) among all overall responses recorded from the start of treatment until the participant withdrew from the study. Objective response was defined as the number of participants with confirmed CR and confirmed PR after 4 cycles of therapy with ARQ 197. According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v 1.1, CR was defined as a disappearance of all target lesions, PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, and SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline up to progressive disease or death (whichever occurs first), up to 1 year 9 months postdose</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of the start of study treatment to the earlier of the dates of the first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause. According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v 1.1, progressive disease was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions.</description>

      <recruitment_details>A total of 27 participants who met all inclusion and no exclusion criteria were enrolled and treated at 7 clinic sites in the United States, 2 in France, and 2 in the United Kingdom. Of the 27 enrolled, 21 were included in Stage 1 in which the interim futility analysis was performed per the Simon 2-stage design.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Based on the Simon 2-stage design, 21 participants were enrolled (Stage 1). If &lt;2 had either a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), then the study was terminated. If ≥2 had either CR or PR, then enrollment was extended to 41 participants. After Stage 2 with 41 participants, treatment was effective if ≥5 had CR or PR after 4 cycles.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Best Overall Response and Objective Response Rate Following Treatment With Tivantinib (ARQ 197) in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Germ Cell Tumors</title>
        <description>The best overall response was the best response (in the order of confirmed complete response [CR], confirmed partial response [PR], unconfirmed CR, unconfirmed PR, stable disease [SD], and progressive disease [PD]) among all overall responses recorded from the start of treatment until the participant withdrew from the study. Objective response was defined as the number of participants with confirmed CR and confirmed PR after 4 cycles of therapy with ARQ 197. According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v 1.1, CR was defined as a disappearance of all target lesions, PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, and SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions.</description>
