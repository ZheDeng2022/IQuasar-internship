      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a degenerative and incurable neuromuscular disorder&#xD;
           that is caused by mutations in the survival motor neuron gene, SMN1, found on chromosome&#xD;
           5. It is the leading inherited cause of infant mortality. SMA carriers (those who have&#xD;
           the genetic mutation but do not have the disease) are often unaware of their status&#xD;
           until they are tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers have been studying the prevalence of SMA carriers in the general population,&#xD;
           but most of the information collected has come from populations within the United&#xD;
           States, Europe, and Asia. Very few studies have been performed in Africa. Furthermore,&#xD;
           this information does not provide much information regarding carrier frequency based on&#xD;
           ethnic background and ancestry. To address this problem, researchers are interested in&#xD;
           studying the prevalence of the SMA genetic mutation in the sub-Saharan nation of Mali.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To collect blood samples for use in studying genetic data related to spinal muscular&#xD;
      atrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers who are at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Volunteers will be of Malian ancestry and nationality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Location:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -&lt;TAB&gt;Bamako, Mali, West Africa&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will first collect blood samples from a small group of volunteers to run&#xD;
           initial SMA carrier testing and resolve any technical difficulties before continuing&#xD;
           with the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will complete questionnaires about their personal and family medical&#xD;
           history, including questions about illnesses, stillborns, and miscarriages, and then&#xD;
           will provide blood samples for genetic research and testing.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive motor neuron disease that is caused&#xD;
      by mutations in the survival motor neuron gene, SMN1. The objective of this study is to&#xD;
      determine the SMN copy number distribution in the Malian population and to compare this to&#xD;
      published data obtained elsewhere. It is anticipated that this study will help to refine the&#xD;
      knowledge of SMA by assessing the distribution of SMN copy number, and the SMA carrier&#xD;
      frequency in a sub-Saharan nation, thus expanding the information base available to&#xD;
      clinicians and patients considering SMA carrier testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include 1400 adult (18 years of age and older) volunteers only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples from volunteers will be collected from students at the School of Medicine,&#xD;
      Pharmacy, and Dentistry (FMPOS) at the University of Bamako, which consists of an ethnically&#xD;
      diverse population representative of the Malian ethnicities. No therapy will be provided to&#xD;
      study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measure for phase 1 is DNA extraction yield of sufficient quantity and quality for&#xD;
      SMN genotyping by LabCorp in at least 90% of samples. Outcome measures for phase 2 are the&#xD;
      frequency of SMA carriers (SMN1 deletion heterozygotes) and the SMN1 and SMN2 copy number&#xD;
      distribution in Mali.&#xD;
