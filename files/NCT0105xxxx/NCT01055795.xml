      The main purpose of this study is to test the safety of three study drugs, bevacizumab&#xD;
      (Avastin™), Everolimus (Afinitor™) and LBH589 (Panobinostat) when they are given together. It&#xD;
      is hoped this study drug combination might lead to a greater decrease the in size of the&#xD;
      cancer and/or slow down how fast the cancer is growing compared to when these drugs are given&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;

      The main purpose of this study is to test the safety of three study drugs, bevacizumab&#xD;
      (Avastin™), Everolimus (Afinitor™) and LBH589 (Panobinostat) when they are given together. It&#xD;
      is hoped this study drug combination might lead to a greater decrease the in size of the&#xD;
      cancer and/or slow down how fast the cancer is growing compared to when these drugs are given&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two parts of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of part I is to find out the highest and safest levels of these drugs when they&#xD;
      are given together. If you are enrolled in part I of the study, you will start all the study&#xD;
      drugs at the same time. The amount (dose) of drugs you will get will depend on when you enter&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of part II is to see what effects, good and/or bad, the study drugs have when&#xD;
      they are given alone and together. In addition, this will also give us a better understanding&#xD;
      of how these study drugs work on you and your cancer. If you are enrolled in part II of the&#xD;
      study, you will enter one of three study drug arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Arm A: You will receive everolimus alone for two weeks, then add bevacizumab and&#xD;
      LBH589 to your study regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Arm B: You will receive LBH589 alone for two weeks, then add bevacizumab and&#xD;
      LBH589 to your study regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Arm C: You will receive everolimus and LBH589 together for two weeks, then add&#xD;
      bevacizumab to your study regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ABOUT THE STUDY DRUGS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bevacizumab (Avastin™) is an intravenous (I.V., meaning through a vein) medication made&#xD;
           from a special type of human and mouse protein called antibodies. Bevacizumab blocks a&#xD;
           factor called VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) which is important for&#xD;
           angiogenesis (the growth of new blood vessels). Blocking this factor is thought to block&#xD;
           the growth of tumor-related blood vessels which may stop the growth of cancer.&#xD;
           Bevacizumab and other drugs that block VEGF activity are currently being evaluated in&#xD;
           clinical research studies in a variety of cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Everolimus (Afintor™) is a pill that works by blocking the activity of a substance in&#xD;
           the body known as mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). mTOR is important for helping&#xD;
           the growth and survival in normal and cancer cells. Blocking mTOR activity has been&#xD;
           shown to slow or kill cancer cells in laboratory studies. Everolimus and other drugs&#xD;
           that block mTOR activity are currently being evaluated in clinical research studies in a&#xD;
           variety of cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LBH589 (Panobinostat) is a new pill that works by blocking a special group of proteins&#xD;
           called histone deacetylases (HDACs). HDACs are important for helping the growth and&#xD;
           survival in normal and cancer cells and for helping the growth of new tumor-related&#xD;
           blood vessels. Blocking HDAC activity has been shown to shown to slow or kill cancer&#xD;
           cells in laboratory studies. LBH589 and other drugs that block HDACs activity are&#xD;
           currently being evaluated in clinical research studies in a variety of cancers. LBH589&#xD;
           (Panobinostat) is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the&#xD;
           treatment of cancer is therefore considered an investigational drug.&#xD;

             which case the patient is ineligible; sputum cytology alone is acceptable. Patients&#xD;
             with extrathoracic-only squamous cell NSCLC are eligible. Patients with only&#xD;
             peripheral lung lesions (of any NSCLC histology) will also be eligible (a peripheral&#xD;
             lesion is defined as a lesion in which the epicenter of the tumor is &lt;/= 2 cm from the&#xD;
             costal or diaphragmatic pleura in a three-dimensional orientation based on each lobe&#xD;
             of the lung and is &lt;/= 2 cm from the trachea, main, and lobar bronchi).&#xD;
