  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Botulinum toxin injection in the contracting muscles has proven to be a safe and effective&#xD;
      method of relieving pain and lessening dystonic posturing. The current hypothesis is that&#xD;
      botulinum toxin works on altering sensory input in the central nervous system in addition to&#xD;
      its effects on the neuromuscular junction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetoencephalography (MEG)of brain has been used in dystonia such as writer's cramp and&#xD;
      musician's hand dystonia. However, no study has investigated the correlation of central&#xD;
      signal changes via magnetoencephalography before and after treatment with botulinum in&#xD;
      torticollis patients. Prior studies using somatosensory potentials indicated the possibility&#xD;
      of differential activation of precentral cortex in patients with cervical dystonia. Cervical&#xD;
      dystonia may result from a disorder of both cortical excitability and intracortical&#xD;
      inhibition. The investigators hypothesis is that botulinum injection modulates central&#xD;
      inhibition which improves clinical outcome for torticollis.&#xD;

      This study of MEG neuro-imagery will increase the understanding of the central pathway&#xD;
      involvement in the efficacy of botulinum toxin treatment for torticollis. Cervical dystonia&#xD;
      (spasmodic torticollis) patients will be selected from the Neurology clinic. Subjects will&#xD;
      range in age from 18 years old through 90 years old. Subjects are expected to be ambulatory&#xD;
      and independent. Patients are generally expected to be in good health. Exclusion criteria&#xD;
      include significant intracranial metal (typically fixed dental bridges or braces) generating&#xD;
      significant magnetic artifact, medical instability, pregnancy, and certain other factors such&#xD;
      as severe head tremors that would produce magnetic artifact. Clinical states of torticollis&#xD;
      patients will be assessed by using Tsui scale. Every torticollis patient will have&#xD;
      magnetoencephalography on the day of botulinum treatment beforehand and approximately 2-8&#xD;
      weeks after botulinum treatment. We will compare the results of magnetoencephalography&#xD;
      between control subject and torticollis patient before botulinum treatment aiming to find any&#xD;
      difference between the two populations. We also compare the results of magnetoencephalography&#xD;
      in individual torticollis patient before and after botulinum treatment, aiming to detect the&#xD;
      changes between these two conditions in the same individual and possibly between the average&#xD;
      of data from each condition before and after botulinum treatment.&#xD;
