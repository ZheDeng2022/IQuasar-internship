      This study is an 18-month, single-group, open-label (name of study drug is known to&#xD;
      patients), multicenter study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and treatment response of&#xD;
      paliperidone palmitate administered as once-monthly injections to patients with schizophrenia&#xD;
      who previously received treatment with oral antipsychotic medications. A target of 587&#xD;
      patients (inpatients or outpatients) with schizophrenia will be enrolled in the study and&#xD;
      will receive, without cost, injections of study drug (paliperidone palmitate) on Days 1, 8,&#xD;
      38, and thereafter at one-month intervals up to 18 months. Enrollment in the study will be&#xD;
      limited to patients who are diagnosed with schizophrenia within the past 5 years. The study&#xD;
      will consist of a screening period of up to 5 days before treatment, an 18-month treatment&#xD;
      period, and an end-of-study or early withdrawal visit approximately 30 days after the last&#xD;
      injection of study drug. During the screening period (after patients have provided signed&#xD;
      informed consent to participate in the study), information will be collected regarding the&#xD;
      patients medical and psychiatric history, demographics (age and race), current symptoms of&#xD;
      the patients schizophrenia, and whether or not the patient would like to sign an additional&#xD;
      informed consent form to participate in the pharmacogenomic (the study of how genes affect a&#xD;
      person's response to drugs) component of the study that involves the collection of one 10 ml&#xD;
      blood sample (equivalent to about 2 teaspoons of blood). During screening, entry criteria for&#xD;
      the study will be reviewed and a physical examination performed. Patients will also be asked&#xD;
      questions about the types of healthcare resources (institutionalizations/hospitalizations,&#xD;
      emergency room visits, etc) they utilized during the previous 12 months however, this&#xD;
      information is optional and its collection will depend upon the availability of the data.&#xD;
      Patients who are currently receiving treatment with any oral antipsychotic medication must&#xD;
      discontinue the use of the medication by Day 1 of the study. If the patient was receiving a&#xD;
      high dose of an antipsychotic medication or was also receiving an anticholinergic medication&#xD;
      (a drug that prevents involuntary muscle movements associated with the use of antipsychotic&#xD;
      drugs in the treatment of schizophrenia), the investigator may decide to have the patients&#xD;
      dose of antipsychotic (and/or anticholinergic) medication tapered (gradually reduced) to&#xD;
      discontinuation beginning on Day 1. The patients time to taper-off the previous antipsychotic&#xD;
      and/or anticholinergic medications will depend on the dose of the medication. Patients&#xD;
      receiving anxiolytics (anti-anxiety drugs), mood stabilizers, anticholinergics, or&#xD;
      antidepressants greater than 4 weeks before the screening visit will be allowed to continue&#xD;
      taking these drugs. Upon meeting the entry criteria for the study, patients will receive a&#xD;
      total of 19 intramuscular (IM) injections of paliperidone palmitate during the 18-month&#xD;
      treatment period as follows: 150 mg equivalent (eq) on Day 1, 100 mg eq on Day 8, 75 mg eq on&#xD;
      Day 38, and paliperidone palmitate injections of 50, 75, 100, or 150 mg eq once monthly on&#xD;
      Days 68, 98, 128, 158, 188, 218, 248, 278, 308, 338, 368, 398, 428, 458, 488 and 518.&#xD;
      Depending on the patients ability to tolerate a dose paliperidone palmitate, doses may be&#xD;
      adjusted higher or lower every 30 days per the clinicians judgment within the dose range of&#xD;
      50 to 150 mg eq. If the patient reports any signs or symptoms of worsening of schizophrenia,&#xD;
      the investigator may prescribe a rescue medication (quick-relief or fast-acting medications&#xD;
      that usually work right away to relieve symptoms) such as lorazepam (an antianxiety drug) to&#xD;
      control agitation, irritability, restlessness, and hostility. The investigator may also&#xD;
      prescribe an anticholinergic medication to treat involuntary movement disorders if observed&#xD;
      in patients. All prescription and over-the-counter medications taken by patients during the&#xD;
      study are to be reported. At the end of the 18-month treatment period, all patients will&#xD;
      complete an end-of-study visit (or early withdrawal visit for patients who do not complete&#xD;
      the study) to have a physical examination performed, laboratory tests (including a urine&#xD;
      pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential) performed, vital signs measured, and&#xD;
      information collected regarding the occurrence of adverse events and the use of medications&#xD;
      other than study drug from the time of the previous study visit to the end-of-study (or early&#xD;
      withdrawal visit). The primary objective of the study is to evaluate safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      treatment response of once-monthly injections of paliperidone palmitate measured by the use&#xD;
      of a Positive And Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS). The safety and tolerability of once-monthly&#xD;
      injections of paliperidone palmitate administered to patients with schizophrenia will be&#xD;
      evaluated during the study by monitoring adverse events, findings from clinical laboratory&#xD;
      tests (serum chemistry including lipids), vital sign measurements (blood pressure, pulse&#xD;
      rate, and weight), physical examinations, and movement disorder evaluations using the&#xD;
      Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale [ESRS-A]). All clinically significant abnormalities in&#xD;
      patients that persist at the end of the study will be followed by the Investigator until&#xD;
      resolution or until a clinically stable endpoint is reached. Treatment response will be&#xD;
      evaluated 5 times during the study (Visits 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10) by findings obtained from the&#xD;
      PANSS (a 30-item questionnaire that is administered to the patient by a qualified person [ie,&#xD;
      rater] to measure the presence/absence and severity of positive and negative symptoms of&#xD;
      schizophrenia. In addition to the safety, tolerability, and treatment response data&#xD;
      collected, patients who volunteer to participate in the pharmacogenomic component of the&#xD;
      study will have one 10 ml sample of blood collected at on Days of Visit 2. If a replacement&#xD;
      blood sample is needed for the pharmacogenomic component of the study, the patient will need&#xD;
      to sign an additional informed consent form. Patients will receive a paliperidone palmitate&#xD;
      intramuscular (IM) injection of 150 mg equivalent (eq) on Day 1, 100 mg eq on Day 8, and 75&#xD;
      mg eq on Day 38.Thereafter, patients will receive once monthly IM injections of 50, 75, 100,&#xD;
      or 150 mg eq of paliperidone palmitate. Doses may be adjusted every 30 days per the&#xD;
      clinician's judgment within the dose range of 50 to 150 mg eq.Patients will receive a total&#xD;
      of 19 injections of study drug over an 18-month treatment period.&#xD;
