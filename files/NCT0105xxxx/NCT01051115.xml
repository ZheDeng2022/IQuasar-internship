    <textblock>
      Patients with chemo refractory CLL have a poor prognosis. 2 independent mechanisms are&#xD;
      attributed to the development of chemoresistance in CLL. The first is a shift in the balance&#xD;
      between pro- and anti-apoptotic regulators. The second mechanism is based on acquired&#xD;
      mutations resulting in a dysfunctional p53 response. Recent studies indicate that the&#xD;
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib acts synergistically with both purine analogies and&#xD;
      alkylating agents. Also, dasatinib has the potency to restore the apoptotic balance of CLL&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Dasatinib will be clinically active in chemo-refractory CLL patients and will act&#xD;
      synergistically with the purine-analogue fludarabine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in the western world. The&#xD;
      disease mostly affects the elderly. At present no curative therapy is available. Although the&#xD;
      majority of patients initially do respond to chemotherapy, most patients eventually develop&#xD;
      drug resistance. The prognosis for patients with chemotherapy resistant disease is very poor&#xD;
      wit an overall survival of approximately 10 months. Standard therapy for these patients&#xD;
      currently does not exist. Treatment with the monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab could be tried,&#xD;
      however toxicity of this drug is high especially following multiple cycles of chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is still considered experimental in this setting and is&#xD;
      only available for a minority of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of chemoresistant disease is highly correlated with a disturbed balance of&#xD;
      apoptosis regulating molecules, resulting in a decrease in sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli.&#xD;
      The tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib (SprycelÂ®) is successfully being used in the&#xD;
      treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). This form of chronic leukemia is also&#xD;
      characterized by a disturbed balance between apoptosis regulating genes, which can be&#xD;
      restored by tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Recent studies indicate that also in CLL, dasatinib&#xD;
      has the potential to restore the apoptotic balance. In this clinical study we will&#xD;
      investigate whether dasatinib is an effective drug in the treatment of chemoresistant CLL and&#xD;
      whether treatment with dasatinib restores the sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the response rate and response quality of dasatinib monotherapy or&#xD;
      dasatinib/fludarabine combination in fludarabine refractory CLL patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary To asses the overall safety profile of this treatment approach To asses event free&#xD;
      survival (i.e. time from registration to induction failure, progression, relapse or death&#xD;
      whichever occurs first), progression free survival (i.e. time from registration to disease&#xD;
      progression, relapse or death due to CLL whichever occurs first) and disease free survival&#xD;
      (i.e. time from CR to relapse) To asses influence of dasatinib on the expression profile of&#xD;
      apoptosis regulatory genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether dasatinib acts synergistically with other immuno-chemotherapeutic agents&#xD;
      by co-culture experiments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, multi center clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with CLL in need of treatment AND fludarabine refractory, age 18-80 year inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated with dasatinib monotherapy 100mg daily. At four weeks patients will&#xD;
      be re-evaluated. Patients with less than a partial response will receive fludarabine (orally&#xD;
      40mg/daily for 3 days q28) in addition to dasatinib. After two cycles of fludarabine,&#xD;
      responses will be evaluated. In case of progressive disease following 2 cycles of fludarabine&#xD;
      in combination with dasatinib, patients will go off study. All other patients will be treated&#xD;
      with four more cycles of fludarabine in combination with daily dasatinib treatment. Patients&#xD;
      that receive monotherapy after the initial 28 days and that develop progressive disease will&#xD;
      'cross-over' to the combination treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study parameters/outcome of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -- Clinical response rate and quality ( CR, PR) at 32 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      -In case of complete responses: minimal residual disease status&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall safety profile as determined by the incidence of clinically significant adverse&#xD;
           events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Event free survival (i.e. time from registration to induction failure, progression,&#xD;
           relapse or death whichever occurs first), progression free survival (i.e. time from&#xD;
           registration to disease progression, relapse or death due to CLL whichever occurs first)&#xD;
           and disease free survival (i.e. time from CR to relapse)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extensive (functional) In vitro studies of dasatinib treated cells will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Expression profile of apoptosis regulatory genes at the mRNA level (MLPA) and protein&#xD;
           level (western blot)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study in vitro synergy of dasatinib treatment with different chemotherapeutic and&#xD;
           immunotherapeutic drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness (if applicable):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The monitoring of the patients during treatment and follow-up are according to the standard&#xD;
      procedures in the treatment of patients with CLL. This means physical examination at a&#xD;
      regular frequency (7 times from registration until the end of treatment; every 3 months&#xD;
      during follow-up), blood sample analysis (9 times from registration until the end of&#xD;
      treatment; every 3 months during follow-up), bone marrow analysis (2 times from registration&#xD;
      until the end of treatment) and CT-scan (4 times from registration until the end of&#xD;
      treatment). In addition, an ECG will be performed at entry of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hematological side-effects of dasatinib are cytopenias. Especially a drop in leukocytes and&#xD;
      thrombocytes has been reported. In most cases, cytopenias can be controlled by dose&#xD;
      adjustment. A temporarily inflammation of the liver can occur (&lt; 3% of patients) and is in&#xD;
      most cases reversible by dose adjustment. Most other reported side-effects are nausea, muscle&#xD;
      cramps, painful joints, headache, fluid retention (including pleural effusion) and gain of&#xD;
      weight. Most of the side-effects can successfully be managed by dose-adjustment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side-effects of fludarabine in the dose just in this study are temporarily cytopenias,&#xD;
      nausea, emesis, diarrhea, mucositis, liver function abnormalities, fever, rash,&#xD;
      conjunctivitis and dizziness.&#xD;
