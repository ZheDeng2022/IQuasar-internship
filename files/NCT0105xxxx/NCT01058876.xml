  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' general hypothesis is that African-Americans (AAs) smoke more for positive&#xD;
      reinforcement from nicotine with a &quot;peak-seeking&quot; pattern of smoking (smoking individual&#xD;
      cigarettes more intensively with greater intake of nicotine and tobacco smoke toxins), while&#xD;
      whites smoke more for negative reinforcement with a &quot;trough-maintaining&quot; pattern (avoiding&#xD;
      withdrawal by maintaining more consistent nicotine levels throughout the day by means of a&#xD;
      more regular smoking pattern). We, the investigators, believe that these patterns are linked&#xD;
      to identifiable racial differences in nicotine pharmacology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study we hypothesize that if AAs behave more like nicotine &quot;peak-seeker&quot; while&#xD;
      whites behave more like nicotine &quot;trough-maintainers&quot;, that AAs will respond to switching&#xD;
      from regular to low nicotine yield commercial cigarettes by smoking each cigarette relatively&#xD;
      more intensively with a relatively smaller increase in daily cigarette consumption&#xD;
      (cigarettes per day or CPD) as compared to whites.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several lines of evidence indicate that AAs are more highly addicted to cigarette smoking&#xD;
      than are whites. AAs are more likely to smoke their first cigarette within 10 minutes of&#xD;
      awakening, an indicator of the severity of the dependence. They are more likely to want to&#xD;
      quit smoking and are more likely to try to quit (attempts lasting at least 24 hours, but are&#xD;
      significantly less likely than whites to be successful abstainers at one year. The quit ratio&#xD;
      (former smokers/ever smokers) was recently reported to be 37.3% in AAs compared to 51% for&#xD;
      whites (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NICOTINE REGULATION IN AAS AND WHITES: In general smokers regulate (titrate) their smoking to&#xD;
      take in about the same amount of nicotine from day to day. This behavior is well demonstrated&#xD;
      in studies of smokers smoking commercial cigarettes of differing yields, showing that smokers&#xD;
      take in similar amounts of nicotine from high- and low-yield cigarettes. NCI MONOGRAPH 13&#xD;
      summarized the data on nicotine and low yield cigarettes and concluded that low yield&#xD;
      cigarettes presented the same health risks as high yield cigarettes (12). However, most or&#xD;
      all of the research on nicotine titration appears to have been done primarily in white&#xD;
      smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We believe that nicotine titration patterns will differ in AAs compared to whites, based on&#xD;
      the hypothesis that AAs smoke more for the positive reinforcing effects of individual&#xD;
      cigarettes, while whites smoke more to maintain a consistent level of nicotine. We predict&#xD;
      that the response to switching from regular to low yield cigarettes in AAs will differ in&#xD;
      that they will try to take in more nicotine per cigarette by smoking more intensively, but&#xD;
      will be less likely to try to regulate their total daily intake of nicotine compared to&#xD;
      whites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Melanin: A recent study (14) showed that levels of facultative melanin (includes both&#xD;
      genetically and exposure influenced melanin) in the skin are significantly and positively&#xD;
      related to cigarettes per day, the Fagerstrom score, and cotinine levels. By measuring&#xD;
      melanin levels in our own study subjects, we will be able to determine if there is a&#xD;
      relationship between melanin levels and nicotine pharmacokinetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a non-randomized, non-blinded, two treatment arm crossover study with an oral&#xD;
      nicotine and cotinine pharmacokinetic study. Cigarettes will be supplied for both treatment&#xD;
      arms and subjects will smoke ad libitum. During the first arm, the subject will smoke their&#xD;
      &quot;usual&quot; cigarettes and also undergo an oral pharmacokinetics protocol. During the second arm,&#xD;
      subjects will smoke a commercial cigarette with a machine-determined nicotine yield of&#xD;
      approximately 50% of their &quot;usual&quot; brand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine samples will be collected throughout the study and analyzed by our usual&#xD;
      methods.&#xD;
