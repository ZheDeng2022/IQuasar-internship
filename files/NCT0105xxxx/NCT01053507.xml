  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of Treximet when taken for post traumatic headache&#xD;
      by measuring any change in the number of headache days or any change in a subject's ability&#xD;
      to think following treatment with study medication. Eligible subjects will complete 3 visits.&#xD;
      Following Visit 1, subjects will treat with their usual medication and document headache&#xD;
      symptoms and therapy in a Headache Diary. After 30 days, subjects will return for Visit 2 and&#xD;
      be randomized (like the flip of a coin) to receive Treximet or matching placebo to treat at&#xD;
      the same time each day. Treximet will be provided to treat any headache that occurs. Subjects&#xD;
      will complete a daily Diary. After 30 days, subjects will exit the study at Visit 3.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be enrolled at 3 investigative sites. At Visit 1, a medical, headache, and&#xD;
      medication history will be collected and a physical and neurological exam with vital signs&#xD;
      will be performed. An ECG will be completed if one has not been completed in the previous 6&#xD;
      months. Subjects will be administered a series of psychological tests to help the study&#xD;
      doctor decide whether or not a subject is eligible. The Headache Impact Test-6 and Migraine&#xD;
      Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire will be completed at each visit. During a 30-day&#xD;
      Baseline Period, subjects will treat with their usual medication and complete a daily Diary&#xD;
      documenting headache symptoms and treatment. At Visits 2 and 3 subjects will complete the&#xD;
      Mental Efficiency Workload Test and Migraine Early Warning Tool. Following randomization at&#xD;
      Visit 2, subjects will treat daily for 30 days with Treximet or a matching placebo. Subjects&#xD;
      will be provided with Treximet for rescue of any persisting or recurring headache. During the&#xD;
      Treatment Period, subjects will complete a daily Diary reporting headache symptoms and&#xD;
      response to treatment. After the 30-day Treatment Period, subjects will exit the study at&#xD;
      Visit 3 .&#xD;

        <title>Migraine Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MSQ)</title>
        <description>The Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MSQ) is a scale that measures the impact of migraine across three aspects: role function-restrictive (RR), role function-preventive (RP), and emotional function (EF). Possible scores on each subscale range from a 0 to 100 scale such that higher scores indicate better quality of life.</description>
