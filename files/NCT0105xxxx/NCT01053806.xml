    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient is, in the investigator(s) opinion, willing and able to comply with the&#xD;
             protocol requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient has given voluntary written informed consent before performance of any&#xD;
             study-related procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that&#xD;
             consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to their future&#xD;
             medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient is older than 18 years at the time of signing the informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Female subjects of childbearing potential† must:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Understand that the study medication could have a potential teratogenic risk&#xD;
             (Lenalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide which is a known human&#xD;
             teratogenic active substance that causes severe life-threatening birth defects.&#xD;
             Lenalidomide induced in monkeys malformations similar to those described with&#xD;
             thalidomide)&#xD;
&#xD;
             Agree to use, and be able to comply with, effective contraception without&#xD;
             interruption, 4 weeks before starting study drug, throughout study drug therapy&#xD;
             (including dose interruptions) and for 4 weeks after the end of study drug therapy,&#xD;
             even if she has amenorrhoea. This applies unless the subject commits to absolute and&#xD;
             continued abstinence confirmed on a monthly basis. The following are effective methods&#xD;
             of contraception • Implant - Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (IUS)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Medroxyprogesterone acetate depot • Tubal sterilisation • Sexual intercourse with&#xD;
                  a vasectomised male partner only; vasectomy must be confirmed by two negative&#xD;
                  semen analyses • Ovulation inhibitory progesterone-only pills (i.e., desogestrel)&#xD;
&#xD;
             Combined oral contraceptive pills are not recommended. If a subject was using combined&#xD;
             oral contraception, she must switch to one of the methods above. The increased risk of&#xD;
             VTE continues for 4 to 6 weeks after stopping combined oral contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
             prophylactic antibiotics should be considered at the time of insertion particularly in&#xD;
             patients with neutropenia due to risk of infection&#xD;
&#xD;
             o Agree to have a medically supervised pregnancy test with a minimum sensitivity of 25&#xD;
             mIU/ml not more than 3 days from the start of study medication once the subject has&#xD;
             been on effective contraception for at least 4 weeks. This requirement also applies to&#xD;
             women of childbearing potential who practice complete and continued abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Agree to have a medically supervised pregnancy test every 4 weeks including 4 weeks&#xD;
             after the end of study treatment, except in the case of confirmed tubal sterilization.&#xD;
             These tests should be performed not more than 3 days before the start of next&#xD;
             treatment. This requirement also applies to women of childbearing potential who&#xD;
             practice complete and continued abstinence&#xD;
&#xD;
             Male subjects must Agree to use condoms throughout study drug therapy, during any dose&#xD;
             interruption and for one week after cessation of study therapy if their partner is of&#xD;
             childbearing potential and has no contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Agree not to donate semen during study drug therapy and for one week after end of&#xD;
             study drug therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             All subjects must Agree to abstain from donating blood while taking study drug therapy&#xD;
             and for one week following discontinuation of study drug therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Agree not to share study medication with another person and to return all unused study&#xD;
             drug to the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
