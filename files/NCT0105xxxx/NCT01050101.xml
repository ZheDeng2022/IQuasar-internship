  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study, investigators are interested in how certain dietary fibers in the&#xD;
      diet affect certain hormones released from your intestine after eating and how these&#xD;
      influence your appetite. The study hypothesis is that certain fibers will slow digestion and&#xD;
      absorption of nutrients thereby optimizing fullness,reducing food intake and limiting insulin&#xD;
      response in pre- and post-menopausal women.&#xD;

      This study is designed to gain a better understanding of meal viscosity and the utility of&#xD;
      dietary sources of viscous polysaccharide fibers to modulate postprandial metabolic and&#xD;
      satiety mechanisms in pre- and post- menopausal overweight women in order to optimize acute&#xD;
      metabolic responses to meals as well as most favorably affect appetite, food intake and&#xD;
      overall body weight control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of this study include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the effects of viscous polysaccharide type fibers in a meal on&#xD;
           postprandial intestinal-phase mechanisms of satiety [eg., cholecystokinin (CCK)] and&#xD;
           meal-associated metabolic (eg., glucose, insulin, triglyceride) response patterns to low&#xD;
           glycemic index (GI), fiber-controlled preload meals compared to a low fiber, high GI&#xD;
           meal in overweight pre- and post- menopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To characterize the subjective and behavioral satiety responses to study-specific&#xD;
           preload meals varying in viscous fiber content as well as determine the relationship of&#xD;
           these satiety responses to the preload-associated physiological responses in overweight&#xD;
           pre- and post- menopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To examine the influence of menopausal status of overweight women on the physiological,&#xD;
           subjective and behavioral responses to study preloads.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a randomized, 3-arm, 6-sequence, within-subjects, crossover,&#xD;
      treatment-controlled study utilizing a repeated measures, multiple sampling paradigm to&#xD;
      evaluate the metabolic and satiety response pattern to low glycemic index (GI)&#xD;
      fiber-controlled preload treatments differing in viscous fiber content compared to a high GI&#xD;
      preload meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will test 3 isocaloric treatment preloads in relatively healthy overweight, mildly&#xD;
      obese, pre- and post- menopausal women. Preload meals will be prepared as breakfast meals&#xD;
      using muffins and yogurt beverage / shake as the base for which glycemic index (GI) of the&#xD;
      meal, including fiber / viscous fiber content, will be manipulated. All preloads have been&#xD;
      matched as close as possible on sensory qualities as well as macronutrient composition, fiber&#xD;
      and energy content and volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 3 treatments will include as fiber source either viscous polysaccharide fiber source,&#xD;
      eg., psyllium husk, and insoluble non-viscous producing fiber source, eg., cellulose,&#xD;
      respectively. These fibers are commercially available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preload meals will be prepared to contain about 1 kcal/g offered as a 600 kcal meal portion.&#xD;
      The macronutrient distribution for fat, carbohydrate and protein will be 30%, 55% and 15% of&#xD;
      energy, respectively. Fiber will be included at 2 levels: 2 g/100 kcal for the 2 fiber&#xD;
      containing preload meals and no fiber for the high GI low fiber control. These levels of&#xD;
      fiber are consistent with our previously studied breakfast meals and for the higher fiber&#xD;
      meals, just above the recommended intake for adult Americans. Preload meals will be matched&#xD;
      as closely as possible on micronutrients and sensory (palatability, sweetness, texture)&#xD;
      quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preload meals be provided under fasting conditions and consumed within 20 minutes. Subsequent&#xD;
      food intake will be measured in lab at a test meal and then by food records at home&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive each preload meal in random order ~ 1 month apart in order to&#xD;
      standardize cyclic phase within the pre-menopausal group. Each preload test session will&#xD;
      include collection of food records and menstrual logs, in-lab preload and test meal&#xD;
      consumption, multiple blood sampling and visual analog scale completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sample collection and visual analog scale (VAS) completion will occur before (fasting,&#xD;
      time 0) preload meal consumption and then at 20, 40, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min&#xD;
      thereafter. A test meal lunch will be offered 2.5 h post-preload meal consumption. Test meal&#xD;
      will be provided ad libitum. Final two blood draws and satiety evaluation will occur after&#xD;
      lunch (210 and 240 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be measured for glucose, insulin, triglycerides and CCK at the specific time&#xD;
      periods listed above. Occuring at the same time period, the subject will complete the VAS, a&#xD;
      validated method for assessing subjective measures of appetite. Subjects will also rate the&#xD;
      preload meals using the VAS on a number of sensory qualities to assess palatability.&#xD;
