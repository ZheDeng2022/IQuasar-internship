      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Research has shown that the hormone corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is involved in&#xD;
      stress and anxiety, and that drugs that block the effect of CRH in the body can reduce&#xD;
      anxiety. GSK561679 is an experimental drug that attempts to reduce anxiety by blocking the&#xD;
      effect of CRH. Researchers are interested in comparing GSK561679 with other treatments for&#xD;
      anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine the effectiveness of GSK561679 compared with placebo and alprazolam (Xanax),&#xD;
      as a possible treatment for fear and anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy female volunteers between 21 and 50 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will involve one screening visit, four testing visits, and one follow-up&#xD;
           visit over a period of 8-9 weeks. The testing sessions will be between 6-11 days apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must follow these dietary restrictions to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No nicotine, alcohol, or caffeine (including chocolate and soft drinks) for 24 hours&#xD;
           before the start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No nicotine in the past 6 months, and no nicotine until the final blood sample is&#xD;
           collected at the follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No alcohol or caffeine for 24 hours before a testing visit or for 72 hours after each&#xD;
           visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No grapefruit or grapefruit products from 14 days before the first dose of study&#xD;
           medication until collection of the final blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive a dose of GSK561679, alprazolam, or placebo 3 hours before the&#xD;
           testing, and will take an additional pill 1 hour before the testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the tests, participants will receive brief electric shocks and hear sudden loud&#xD;
           noises. The noises and shocks will be given over a period of approximately 40 minutes&#xD;
           per session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin conduction, heart rate, and blinking will be monitored throughout the tests, and&#xD;
           participants will be asked about anxiety levels and will be tested on mood, memory, and&#xD;
           concentration. Blood and saliva samples will also be taken during these sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will stay in the clinical center for 1 to 2 hours after the study testing&#xD;
           to ensure that the sedation has worn off. Participants will not be allowed to drive home&#xD;
           or take public transportation alone after study visits, so alternative transportation&#xD;
           must be arranged.&#xD;

      Objective: This proposal is a part of an integrated project to test the efficacy of a&#xD;
      candidate anxiolytic, a CRF1 receptor antagonist, provided by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) as part&#xD;
      of The Emory-MSSM-GSK-NIMH Collaborative Mood Disorders Initiative, using fear-potentiated&#xD;
      startle. The anti-fear and anxiolytic activity of a single dose of the highly specific CRF1&#xD;
      antagonist GSK561679 will be evaluated in healthy female subjects using models of phasic&#xD;
      (fear) and sustained (anxiety) aversive states derived from humans and from pre-clinical&#xD;
      studies in rodents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: The study population will consist of 30 healthy female volunteers, 21-50&#xD;
      years of age, and of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The study will use a double-blind cross-over design in which each subject will&#xD;
      receive placebo, Alprazolam (1 mg), and a low (50 mg) and high (400 mg) dose of GSK561679. We&#xD;
      will examine the effect of these drugs on the potentiation of startle during anticipation of&#xD;
      no-shock, predictable shock signaled by a discrete threat cue, and unpredictable shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The main outcome measures are the magnitude of the startle reflex and&#xD;
      retrospective anxiety during each condition. Secondary measures will include the skin&#xD;
      conductance response and changes in heart rate, as well as measures of HPA activity.&#xD;
