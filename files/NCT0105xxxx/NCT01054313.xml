      The goal of this clinical research study to find the highest tolerated dose of the&#xD;
      combination of Taxotere (docetaxel) and Rapamycin (sirolimus) when given to patients with&#xD;
      advanced cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers also want to find highest tolerated dose of the combination of docetaxel,&#xD;
      sirolimus, and prednisone when given to patients with advanced prostate cancer. The safety of&#xD;
      both drug combinations will also be studied.&#xD;

      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Docetaxel is designed to stop the growth of cancer cells, which may cause the cells to die.&#xD;
      It is believed to be weakly effective at killing blood vessels in tumor tissue as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sirolimus is designed to block a protein called mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inside&#xD;
      the cancer cell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prednisone is a corticosteroid that is similar to a natural hormone made by your body.&#xD;
      Prednisone is often given in combination with chemotherapy to treat cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose&#xD;
      level of the combination of docetaxel and sirolimus based on when you joined this study. Up&#xD;
      to 12 dose levels of docetaxel and sirolimus will be tested. Three (3) to 6 participants will&#xD;
      be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose&#xD;
      level. Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable&#xD;
      side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of docetaxel and&#xD;
      sirolimus is found. Once the highest tolerable dose of docetaxel and sirolimus is found, up&#xD;
      to 12 more patients may be enrolled to further study the safety of the drug at each of that&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you have prostate cancer, you will also receive prednisone. All participants who receive&#xD;
      prednisone will receive the same dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study cycle is 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Everyday, you will take sirolimus by mouth 1 time a day. Sirolimus can be taken with or&#xD;
      without food, but should be taken at the same time everyday.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of every cycle, you will receive docetaxel by vein over about 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are taking prednisone, you will take it 2 times every day by mouth with food and&#xD;
      water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every week for the first 3 weeks and then about every 3 weeks, blood (about 5 teaspoons) will&#xD;
      be drawn for routine tests. You will also have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 6 weeks, women who are able to have children will have blood drawn for a pregnancy&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About every three weeks, blood (about 5 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check&#xD;
      your kidney function, and for biomarker tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About every 6 weeks, you will have a CT scan and x-ray to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be on study for as long as you are benefitting. You will be taken off the study if&#xD;
      the disease gets worse or you experience intolerable side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you experience intolerable side effects, you will be followed until the side effect has&#xD;
      resolved or the side effect does not continue to improve or get worse. The study doctor will&#xD;
      tell you what tests will need to be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Docetaxel is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      the treatment of advanced cancers such as breast, lung, and prostate cancer. Sirolimus is FDA&#xD;
      approved and commercially available for the prevention of transplant rejection in kidney&#xD;
      transplant patients. Prednisone is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment&#xD;
      of prostate cancer when given with docetaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of docetaxel and sirolimus, with or without prednisone, to treat advanced&#xD;
      cancer is investigational. Most patients in this study will receive docetaxel and sirolimus.&#xD;
      However, if you have prostate cancer, you will receive docetaxel, prednisone, and sirolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 68 patients will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
