      The study will involve cardiac rehabilitation clients and will measure their weight, height,&#xD;
      waist circumference and blood pressure comparisons between first and final visit (after 8&#xD;
      weeks). A control group will receive usual care and an experimental group will receive usual&#xD;
      care plus a portion control plate for their meals. Patients currently have their waist&#xD;
      circumference, weight, height and blood pressure measured at their first visit (week 0) and&#xD;
      at their final visit (week 8). This study would compare these three parameters at these same&#xD;
      times (week 0 and week 8) between the control and experimental groups. The control group&#xD;
      would receive the usual care while the experimental group would receive usual care plus be&#xD;
      given a portion control plate at week 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that subjects from the experimental group will have an&#xD;
      average reduction in: (a) waist circumference by &gt; 5%, (b) weight or BMI by &gt; 5%, and (c)&#xD;
      systolic and diastolic blood pressure by &gt;10%. The subjects in the control group are&#xD;
      hypothesized to show an average less than these targets for the experimental group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Canada, 6.8 million adults are overweight and an additional 4.5 million are obese, which&#xD;
      translates to about 58.3% of Canadian adults being overweight or obese. The overall cost of&#xD;
      obesity in British Columbia (2006) is estimated to be $563 million dollars. An increase in&#xD;
      food portion sizes and sedentary lifestyle of Canadians has contributed to the imbalance in&#xD;
      caloric intake and usage. Obesity is the leading risk factor for many chronic diseases and&#xD;
      has been linked directly to an increased incidence of heart disease and hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac Rehabilitation (CR) Phase I involves the rehabilitation of patients with cardiac&#xD;
      disease in an outpatient setting at the Richmond Hospital. It is an 8-week interdisciplinary&#xD;
      program involving exercise, group education, and individual counselling. Currently, patients&#xD;
      are referred by a cardiologist to the CR program and have parameters like their blood&#xD;
      pressure and waist circumference measured at the first and final visits. Over the past year,&#xD;
      the average change in blood pressure from the first to last day (after 8 weeks) was a&#xD;
      reduction of 12.2 systolic blood pressure and 3.1 diastolic blood pressure. The average waist&#xD;
      circumference changed by 0.88 cm. Patients are offered an optional individual visit with the&#xD;
      dietitian and are required to attend a weekly nutrition education class.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight Loss with Portion Plates Portion sizes are essential in determining the amount of&#xD;
      calories consumed at meal times. When larger portions are consumed, there is a greater amount&#xD;
      of calories ingested. The Canadian Community Health Survey (2004) found that the average&#xD;
      adult consumed about 2732 kilocalories daily, which is increased from the average of 2356&#xD;
      kilocalories in 1991.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One randomized controlled study looked at the impact of a portion control tool (portion&#xD;
      plate) on the weight changes in diabetic patients and found a significantly greater weight&#xD;
      loss in patients using the tool versus the control group. No other studies were found that&#xD;
      measured the efficacy of these tools in cardiac patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertension and Weight Reduction Body mass index (BMI) is a common tool used to compare&#xD;
      height and weight, that is calculated by weight (kg) divided by height squared (m²). A person&#xD;
      with an acceptable body weight has a BMI of 18.5-24.9 kg/ m². Obesity is defined as a BMI of&#xD;
      30 kg/ m². Increased body weight or a high BMI is a risk factor for hypertension. A reduction&#xD;
      in BMI through non-pharmacological methods like caloric reduction and physical activity has&#xD;
      significantly improved cardiac risk factors in some studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine physical activity has been shown to reduce blood pressure. Studies on blood pressure&#xD;
      and exercise have showed improvements of 10-20%. Systolic blood pressure was reduced by 1.6&#xD;
      mm Hg systolic and 1.1 mm Hg diastolic for every 1 kg of weight lost in overweight patients.&#xD;
      Studies demonstrated that a reduction of each 100 mmol/day of dietary sodium was associated&#xD;
      with a decline of 5-7 mmHg/2.7 mmHg in hypertensive subjects. Based on the literature, the&#xD;
      experimental group was hypothesized to have a reduction of 10% of both systolic and diastolic&#xD;
      blood pressure (or a systolic decrease of 13 mm Hg or more, and diastolic reduction of 8 mm&#xD;
      Hg or more) versus a &lt;10% reduction in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Waist Circumference and Weight Loss Waist circumference that is indicative of an increased&#xD;
      risk of diseases, including coronary heart disease is 88 cm for women and 102 cm for men.&#xD;
      Reducing waist circumference through weight loss can lower a person's risks of hypertension&#xD;
      and coronary heart disease. Using waist circumference in combination with BMI is useful in&#xD;
      determining a person's health risks, especially if the person has a normal BMI but a high&#xD;
      waist circumference. Elevations in both BMI and waist circumference are independent risk&#xD;
      factors in heart disease, increasing the heart disease risk factors by 2-4 fold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of a portion control tool (portion&#xD;
      plate) could improve the waist circumference, weight loss and blood pressure of the patients&#xD;
      within a cardiac rehabilitation program. If the tool is shown to statistically improve these&#xD;
      outcomes when compared with a control group receiving usual care, the tool may be added to&#xD;
      the usual care of these patients in the long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives and Research Question This randomized controlled study will ask: How will portion&#xD;
      control plates impact the weight, blood pressure and waist circumference of patients in a&#xD;
      cardiac rehabilitation program?&#xD;
