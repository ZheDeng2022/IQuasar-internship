  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Historically, sickle cell disease has not been viewed in the chronic pain paradigm because of&#xD;
      its recurrent nature. Patients with sickle cell disease may be hospitalized for extended&#xD;
      periods of time. As the hospital stay progresses, patients with SCD pain are often observed&#xD;
      by clinicians to have improvements in function in areas such as self-care, mobility, and&#xD;
      recreation despite continued self-report of high pain scores. This pattern of functional&#xD;
      improvement with continued report of high pain intensity scores is common in patients with&#xD;
      recurrent and chronic pain. A functional assessment tool that can assess function in the&#xD;
      acute inpatient setting is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the Inpatient Pediatric Physical Activity&#xD;
      Questionnaire (IPPAQ), as a measure of daily function in children with sickle cell disease&#xD;
      hospitalized with vasoocclusive pain.&#xD;
