    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of one dose of A/H1N1&#xD;
      non-adjuvanted pandemic vaccine to support registration of the vaccine in India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the safety profile (injection site reactions and systemic events) of the&#xD;
           vaccine within 21 days following vaccination, and serious adverse events throughout the&#xD;
           study in all subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the immune response to the vaccine 21 days after vaccination by&#xD;
           hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) testing in all subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the antibody persistence 6 months after vaccination by HAI testing in all&#xD;
           subjects.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each study participant will receive one dose of the study vaccine on Day 0, provide pre- and&#xD;
      post-vaccination blood samples at 21 and 180 days for immunogenicity testing and undergo&#xD;
      safety follow-up for 6 months post-vaccination.&#xD;
