  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of a protocol for inducing a falciparum malaria infection in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers in order to test the activity of novel agents being developed as drugs for the&#xD;
      treatment of uncomplicated malaria. In this pilot study, 16 healthy male volunteers will be&#xD;
      administered a low level malaria infection via infected human red blood cells. After 6 days&#xD;
      they will be administered one of two registered antimalarial treatments (8 volunteers for&#xD;
      each treatment) in order to define the rate of clearance of the infection. This information&#xD;
      will be used to design similar future studies for the initial assessment of the efficacy of&#xD;
      novel antimalarial drugs in development.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, controlled, randomized, study using a BSP inoculum challenge as a&#xD;
      model to assess the activity of antimalarial agents. The study will be conducted in 2 cohorts&#xD;
      (n = 6 and n = 10). Cohort 2 will not commence until at least after day 12 of cohort 1 and&#xD;
      review by Safety Review Team following day 9 exit of cohort 1. The participants will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 to the two registered antimalarials. This is an enabling study using&#xD;
      registered antimalarial drugs as reference treatments (one slow acting and one fast acting),&#xD;
      aimed to inform trial design, endpoints and testing regimens for assessing new candidate&#xD;
      antimalarial drugs in development. The study will follow the sequence of the challenge&#xD;
      inoculation, reference treatment and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy male participants will be inoculated on Day 1 with ~1,800 Plasmodium&#xD;
      falciparum-infected human erythrocytes administered intravenously. On an outpatient basis,&#xD;
      participants will be monitored morning (AM) and night (PM) from day 3 to day 5 for adverse&#xD;
      events and the unexpected early onset of symptoms, signs or parasitological evidence of&#xD;
      malaria. On day 5 evening, participants will be admitted to the study unit and confined for&#xD;
      safety monitoring and antimalarial treatment. Reference treatment administration will begin&#xD;
      on the evening of Day 6 and continued on Day 7 and 8 (3 days of treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If clinical or parasitologic evidence of malaria (either the identification of two or more&#xD;
      malaria parasites on a malaria thick film, platelet count less than 100 x109/L, or the onset&#xD;
      of clinical features of malaria) occurs before day 6 evening, allocated treatment will begin&#xD;
      at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following treatment, participants will be followed up as inpatients for at least 86 hours, (4&#xD;
      evenings) to ensure tolerance of the therapy and clinical response, then if clinically well&#xD;
      on an outpatient basis for safety and continued presence of malaria parasites via PCR and&#xD;
      thick blood film review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will be monitored via telephone monitoring, within the clinical research unit&#xD;
      and on outpatient review after malaria challenge inoculation and antimalarial study drug&#xD;
      administration. Blood samples for safety evaluation, malaria monitoring, and red blood cell&#xD;
      antibodies will be drawn at baseline and at nominated times after malaria challenge.&#xD;
