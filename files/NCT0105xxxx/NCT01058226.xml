      This is a prospective, single arm, single intervention safety and immunogenicity study in 6&#xD;
      healthy, malaria-naive adults, conducted to demonstrate the successful implementation of the&#xD;
      well-established malaria challenge model at the Seattle Biomedical Research Institute&#xD;
      (Seattle BioMed).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is designed to demonstrate the ability to inoculate malaria naive human volunteers&#xD;
      with the Plasmodium falciparum strain of malaria sporozoites by the bite of infected&#xD;
      mosquitoes under controlled conditions. Subjects are monitored closely for development of&#xD;
      malaria and treated with standard doses of anti-malarial medications which the Plasmodium&#xD;
      falciparum strain of malaria is known to be sensitive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will undergo malaria sporozoite challenge with wild-type NF54 strain of&#xD;
      Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites administered via the bite of five infected Anopheles&#xD;
      stephensi mosquitoes under controlled containment conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be closely monitored for acute reactogenicity and signs and/or symptoms of&#xD;
      malaria infection, and from day five post-challenge, will have daily blood films examined for&#xD;
      the presence of malaria parasites. Participants who develop malaria infection will be treated&#xD;
      with a standard oral regimen of chloroquine, or other FDA-approved anti-malarial drugs, under&#xD;
      direct observation. Participants will be treated upon first evidence of microscopic&#xD;
      parasitemia or at day 18 if they remain negative. Participants will be housed with study&#xD;
      staff in a local hotel for close observation from day 9 post-challenge, until three&#xD;
      consecutive blood smears are negative and all symptoms have resolved, then followed weekly&#xD;
      for a total of 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up for safety will be conducted at 4- and 6- months post-challenge.&#xD;
