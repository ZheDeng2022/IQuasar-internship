    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Antihormone therapy, such&#xD;
      as bicalutamide, may lessen the amount of androgens made by the body. Selective estrogen&#xD;
      receptor modulators, such as raloxifene, may work together with bicalutamide to stop the&#xD;
      growth of prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial studies giving bicalutamide and raloxifene together in treating&#xD;
      patients with metastatic or hormone-refractory prostate cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the 6-month progression-free survival rate, progression-free survival, and&#xD;
      overall survival of patients receiving bicalutamide and raloxifene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe the adverse event profile of combined treatment with bicalutamide and&#xD;
      raloxifene (adverse events graded using the NCI CTCAE version 3.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To describe the quality of life of patients receiving bicalutamide and raloxifene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral bicalutamide and oral raloxifene on days 1-28. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3-6 months for up to 3&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
