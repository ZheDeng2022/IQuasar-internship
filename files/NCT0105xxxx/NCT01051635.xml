  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Indenoisoquinolines are experimental cancer treatment drugs that damage the DNA in&#xD;
           cells, resulting in cell death. Researchers have been studying these drugs and their&#xD;
           usefulness in treating types of cancer that have not responded well to standard&#xD;
           therapies like surgery or radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LMP400 (NSC 743400) and LMP776 (NSC 725776) are indenoisoquinolines that have not been&#xD;
           given to cancer patients before. These drugs have very similar chemical structures and&#xD;
           work the same way, but researchers do not know which one will work best. More&#xD;
           information is needed about how LMP400 and LMP776 are processed by the body and how&#xD;
           effective they are in treating difficult-to-treat types of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of LMP400 (NSC 743400) and LMP776 (NSC 725776).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study how the body handles LMP400 and LMP776.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effectiveness of LMP400 and LMP776 as a treatment for tumors and&#xD;
           lymphoma that have not responded to standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have malignant solid tumors or Hodgkin s&#xD;
      disease/non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has not responded to standard therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive either LMP400 or LMP776. The treatment cycle will be 28 days.&#xD;
           On the first 5 days of each cycle, participants will receive intravenous doses of their&#xD;
           specific study drug, followed by 23 days without the drug. The 28-day cycle will be&#xD;
           repeated as long as the drug does not cause severe side effects and the cancer remains&#xD;
           stable or improves. The study doctor may increase or decrease the dose of study drug&#xD;
           depending on how well it is tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood, urine, and hair samples and skin and tumor biopsies will be collected during the&#xD;
           first treatment cycle. Routine blood samples will be taken throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other tests, including additional blood and urine samples, computed tomography (CT) or&#xD;
           other scans, and bone marrow samples, may be performed as directed by the study doctors.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Indenoisoquinolines are non-camptothecin inhibitors of topoisomerase 1 (top1) with&#xD;
           improved characteristics over their predecessors. Indenoisoquinolines have better&#xD;
           chemical stability, producing stable DNA-top1 cleavage complexes, and exhibit a&#xD;
           preference for unique DNA cleavage sites, compared with their camptothecin counterparts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They have demonstrated activity against camptothecin-resistant cell lines and produce&#xD;
           DNA-protein crosslinks, which are resistant to reversal. They also show less or no&#xD;
           resistance to cells overexpressing the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, ABCG2,&#xD;
           and multidrug resistance (MDR-1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of LMP400 (NSC 743400) and LMP776 (NSC 725776)&#xD;
           administered intravenously (IV) daily for 5 days (QDx5).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Define the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and toxicity profile associated with&#xD;
           administration of LMP400 and LMP776.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the effect of LMP400 and LMP776 on the pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoint,&#xD;
           gamma-H2AX, in tumor biopsy pre- and post-treatment. In particular, compare the PD&#xD;
           response, defined as the mean percent nuclear area that is gamma-H2AX positive (%NAP) in&#xD;
           tumor biopsies, at the MTD for LMP400 and LMP776, and the toxicity profile versus PD&#xD;
           dose-response relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity of LMP400 and LMP776.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of LMP400 and LMP776.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Adult patients must have histologically confirmed relapsed solid tumor malignancy or&#xD;
      lymphoma that is metastatic or unresectable for which standard curative measures do not exist&#xD;
      or are associated with minimal patient survival benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cycle 1 and subsequent cycles: Patients will be randomized to receive either LMP400 or&#xD;
           LMP776 administered IV QD over 1 hour on days 1-5 followed by 23 days without drug&#xD;
           (28-day cycle).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PK and PD samples will be collected in cycle 1 only. Tumor biopsies will not be&#xD;
           collected during the escalation phase; however, tumor biopsies will be mandatory during&#xD;
           the expansion phase.&#xD;

             be greater than or equal to 1 month since completion of any prior radiation (greater&#xD;
             than or equal to 2 weeks for palliative radiation therapy). However, patients&#xD;
             receiving bisphosphonates for any cancer or undergoing androgen deprivation therapy&#xD;
             for prostate cancer are eligible for this therapy. Prior therapy with topoisomerase I&#xD;
             inhibitors is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  The effects of indenoisoquinolines on the developing human fetus are unknown. For&#xD;
                  this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
                  contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control or abstinence) prior&#xD;
                  to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 2 months after&#xD;
                  discontinuation from the study. Women of child bearing potential must have a&#xD;
                  negative pregnancy test in order to be eligible. Should a woman become pregnant&#xD;
                  or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform&#xD;
                  her treating physician immediately. Because there is an unknown but potential&#xD;
                  risk to nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
                  indenoisoquinolines, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is&#xD;
                  treated with indenoisoquinolines.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Willingness to undergo skin biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At the point when tumor biopsies become mandatory rather than optional, disease&#xD;
                  amenable to biopsy and willingness to undergo biopsies or patient will be&#xD;
                  undergoing a procedure due to medical necessity during which the tissue may be&#xD;
                  collected, or tumor biopsy tissue from a previous research study or medical care&#xD;
                  is available for submission at registration. Criteria for the submission of&#xD;
                  tissue are:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tissue must have been collected within 3 months prior to registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has not received any intervening therapy for their cancer since the collection&#xD;
             of the tumor sample&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumor tissue must meet the minimum requirements outlined in Section 9.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent&#xD;
                  document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases are excluded from this clinical trial, with the&#xD;
             exception of patients whose brain metastatic disease status has remained stable for&#xD;
             greater than or equal to 2 months after treatment of the brain metastases, without&#xD;
             steroids or anti-seizure medications. These patients may be enrolled at the discretion&#xD;
             of the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with clinically significant illnesses which could compromise participation in&#xD;
             the study, including, but not limited to, active or uncontrolled infection, immune&#xD;
             deficiencies, known HIV infection requiring antiretroviral therapy, Hepatitis B,&#xD;
             Hepatitis C, uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, symptomatic congestive&#xD;
             heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction within the past 6&#xD;
             months, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that&#xD;
             would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
