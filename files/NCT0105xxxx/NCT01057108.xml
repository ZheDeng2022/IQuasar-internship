  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The phosphorus content in saliva is increased in chronic kidney disease. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      a chewing gum that binds salivary phosphorus would be a novel, effective agent to reduce&#xD;
      serum levels of phosphorus in patients with chronic kidney disease. We are testing this&#xD;
      hypothesis using a chewing gum called FOSTRAP which has been shown to be effective in a&#xD;
      small, non-randomized study in patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis.&#xD;

      A double-blind, randomized, placebo, controlled trial with an open label extension for those&#xD;
      subjects with end stage renal disease (ESRD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with ESRD will be randomized to receive either FOSTRAP™ 20 mg BID, FOSTRAP™ 40 mg&#xD;
      BID or matching placebo 2x/day. All subjects will participate in a 4 week chewing period&#xD;
      followed by a 4 week follow up period. All subjects will then enter an open label 2 week&#xD;
      extension phase in which they will receive FOSTRAP™ 20 mg TID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) not on dialysis will receive either FOSTRAP™ 20 mg&#xD;
      3x/day or placebo TID for 4 weeks followed by a 4 week follow up period.&#xD;
