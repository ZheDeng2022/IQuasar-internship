  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The growing population of University of Nebraska Medical Center patients with heart failure&#xD;
      combined with the increasing number of surgical procedures performed each year supports the&#xD;
      need for a critical analysis of how to most appropriately manage these patients during the&#xD;
      perioperative period, especially for non-cardiac surgery. Echo-guided hemodynamic management&#xD;
      (EGHEM) is the use of echocardiography data to normalize and/or optimize in real-time,&#xD;
      cardiac output and ventricular filling pressures in the perioperative period for non-cardiac&#xD;
      surgical cases. The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that EGHEM compared to&#xD;
      standard management practices will result in a reduced length of hospital stay in the&#xD;
      noncardiac surgery population. The primary goal of health care providers for patients&#xD;
      requiring anesthetic care, perioperative care, or critical care is ensuring the adequacy of&#xD;
      the patient's circulatory function by optimizing cardiac output and ventricular filling&#xD;
      pressure. Currently, the use of the ECG monitor and systemic blood pressure are the standard&#xD;
      of care for assessing circulatory function. However, those data cannot provide accurate&#xD;
      information on cardiac output and ventricular filling pressure for patients with&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors and/or comorbidities. As a result, managing the hemodynamic&#xD;
      parameters of these patients, as well as their intravenous fluid needs and resuscitation&#xD;
      strategy, we hypothesize that using traditional approaches may lead to significant volume&#xD;
      overload and post-operative cardiovascular complications and morbidity. In this study we&#xD;
      propose an EGHEM strategy that incorporates standard echocardiography generated data points&#xD;
      in addition to the systemic blood pressure and ECG signal to assess, manage, modify and&#xD;
      optimize patient cardiac preload, afterload, heart rate and contractility in the&#xD;
      perioperative period. Based on our initial observations and preliminary data using the EGHEM&#xD;
      approach, we hypothesize that we can demonstrate a significant decrease in hospital length of&#xD;
      stay and an overall decrease in perioperative morbidity at 30 days in the non-cardiac surgery&#xD;
      population using EGHEM compared to standard practices. In this proposal we have designed a&#xD;
      single center, prospective, randomized clinical trial to test our hypothesis.&#xD;

      Step 1: Patient selection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first step in the EGHEM/EGAM process is appropriate patient selection. Patients who have&#xD;
      any of the following cardiovascular risk factors and/or comorbidities and are scheduled for a&#xD;
      non-cardiac surgery are candidates for EGHEM/EGAM:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Urology/gynecology/General surgical patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Non-cardiac surgical population&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. age 65 years or older, OR 19 years or older and one of the following risk factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Hypertension (HTN)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Obesity (body mass index [BMI] &gt;35)&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Renal insufficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Tobacco usage&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Hypercholesterolemia&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Sleep apnea/heavy snoring at night&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. Clinical diagnosis of CHF as defined by:&#xD;

                  -  Dyspnea on exertion&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Orthopnea&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Elevated jugular venous pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Pulmonary rales&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Third heart sound&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Cardiomegaly or pulmonary edema on chest x-ray&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Peripheral edema&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Hepatomegaly&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Pleural effusion&#xD;
&#xD;
             9. Palpitations/irregular heart beats&#xD;
&#xD;
            10. Chest pain at rest and or exercise&#xD;
&#xD;
            11. Murmur on examination&#xD;
&#xD;
            12. Known coronary artery disease (CAD)/stents/coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)&#xD;
&#xD;
            13. Known valvular disease&#xD;
&#xD;
            14. Known stroke or transient ischemic attacks (TIA) Standard Medical Care Step 2:&#xD;
                Pre-op assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2 in the EGAM process involves a bedside, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) pre-op&#xD;
      assessment. The pre-op TTE should be performed by one of the co-investigators, and take less&#xD;
      than 10 minutes to complete. The information acquired by TTE during the pre-op assessment&#xD;
      should include the following five evaluations, in order of importance:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cardiac output on the left side of the heart using spectral Doppler measurements;&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) velocity time integral (VTI)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Heart rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Filling pressures on the left side of the heart using spectral Doppler measurements;&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The pulmonary venous flow pattern defined as co-dominant, systolic dominant or&#xD;
                diastolic dominant&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The mitral inflow pattern defined as normal, impaired relaxation, pseudonormal or&#xD;
                restrictive&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. The E/e' ratio of velocities&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Mitral valve structure and function;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Aortic valve structure and function; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Biventricular contractility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These evaluations are performed using the following TTE views:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Parasternal (PS) window: With the patient in the left lateral decubitus position, the TTE&#xD;
      probe is placed on the 3rd left intercostal space next to the sternum; the light on the probe&#xD;
      should be directed toward the patient's right shoulder. The 2-dimensional image of the long&#xD;
      axis (LAX) should be acquired first. In this view, the following are evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Color Doppler on aortic valve (AV) and mitral valve (MV)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  E-point septal separation (EPSS) To evaluate the PS short axis (SAX), the probe should&#xD;
           be rotated clockwise 60 degrees. The 2-dimensional view should be obtained at the&#xD;
           mid-papillary level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Apical window: With the patient in the same left, lateral, decubitus position, the probe&#xD;
      is placed between the 5th and 6th intercostal space on the left side, close to the nipple&#xD;
      line. The light on the probe should be directed toward the floor or the bed for the 4-chamber&#xD;
      view. The following assessments should be performed in the 4-chamber view:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two-dimensional image;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulsed-wave (PW) Doppler in the right upper pulmonary vein;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PW Doppler at the tip of the MV;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PW Doppler on the MV annulus for tissue Doppler;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Color Doppler on the tricuspid valve (TV) and MV if necessary based on the PS LAX&#xD;
           window.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the apical LAX, the probe should be rotated counterclockwise so that the light is&#xD;
      directed toward the patient's right shoulder. In the LAX view, velocity time integrals (VTIs)&#xD;
      using PW in the left ventricular outflow track (LVOT) and continuous wave (CW) at the level&#xD;
      of the AV should be acquired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Subcostal window: With the patient supine, the TTE probe is placed under the right costal&#xD;
      ridge and directed toward the heart. The light should be directed toward the sonographer&#xD;
      (toward the patient's left) to assess the 4-chamber view.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the subcostal inferior vena cava (IVC) view, the probe should be slightly rotated&#xD;
      counterclockwise until the IVC can be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Medical Care Step 3: Management strategies Step 3 in the EGHEM/EGAM process is to&#xD;
      define patient management strategies based on the pre-op TTE assessment. The main goals of&#xD;
      patient management are to maintain normal cardiac output and filling pressure. Primary and&#xD;
      secondary findings and the associated EGAM strategies to achieve these goals are outlined in&#xD;
      Table 1 and Table 2, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 1: Primary findings and associated management strategy to maintain normal cardiac&#xD;
      output and filling pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echo-Generated Findings EGHEM/EGAM Strategy Cardiac output status Filling pressure status&#xD;
      Normal High Preload reduction Low Normal Afterload reduction Low High Afterload and preload&#xD;
      reduction High High Preload reduction High Normal or low Increase preload&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 2: Secondary findings and associated management strategy to optimize patient&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echo-Generated Finding EGHEM/EGAM Strategy Filling Pressure Other High Aortic stenosis&#xD;
      Preload reduction Normal Aortic stenosis Safe for afterload reduction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mitral regurgitation Afterload reduction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Low contractility Inotropic support&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Suspected or confirmed CAD Maintain heart rate in the 50 - 60 bpm range RV volume&#xD;
           overload Preload reduction RV pressure overload Pulmonary afterload reduction Standard&#xD;
           Medical Care Step 4: Ongoing intra-operative assessment Based on the appropriate EGAM&#xD;
           strategy defined in Step 3, either TEE or TTE should be used during the surgical&#xD;
           procedure for the ongoing patient assessment every 15 to 20 minutes. The PI or Secondary&#xD;
           Investigator will determine whether a TEE or TTE should be conducted intra-operatively.&#xD;
           The results of these tests will be used for research purposes. During surgery: fluid&#xD;
           administration, afterload adjustments, and supported contractility can be implemented to&#xD;
           optimize patient management. It is difficult to assess cardiac output with the current&#xD;
           standard medical care without invasive monitoring. There is minimal risk if the&#xD;
           physician gets distracted by the echocardiogram or the algorithm of the study however it&#xD;
           is unlikely this tool would be a distraction to the physician as it is monitoring the&#xD;
           patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization is very thought through due to the fact that any Urology/Gynecology/General&#xD;
      surgical patient will be consented for the study so there for no specific demographics are&#xD;
      being recruited other than what is in the inclusion criteria. Currently for the UNMC&#xD;
      Urology/Gynecology surgical patients the distribution lies such that 47 percent are men and&#xD;
      53 percent are women.&#xD;
