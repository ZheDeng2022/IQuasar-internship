    <textblock>
      This study collects and studies tissue and blood samples from patients with prostate or&#xD;
      bladder/urothelial cancer that has recurred (come back) at or near the same place as the&#xD;
      original (primary) tumor or has spread to other parts of the body. Studying samples of blood&#xD;
      and tissue samples from patients with prostate or bladder/urothelial cancer in the laboratory&#xD;
      may help doctors learn more about new biomarkers, potential drug targets, and resistance&#xD;
      developing in response to treatment. It may also help doctors find better ways to treat the&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Obtain tissue through tumor biopsies and/or surgical resection and matched blood samples&#xD;
      from patients with localized and metastatic prostate and bladder/urothelial cancer for:&#xD;
      mutation mapping using OncoMap and other high throughput genotyping technologies; sequencing&#xD;
      of tumor genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA); global assessment of gene expression to&#xD;
      generate hypotheses that can be tested in subsequent trials (by gene expression microarrays&#xD;
      and/or complementary [c]DNA sequencing; profiling of genes involved in androgen metabolism&#xD;
      and DNA repair; quantitating peptides, hormones and other locally-derived or systemic&#xD;
      metabolites present in tumor tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Obtain samples from controls, including blood or tissue for comparison with samples noted&#xD;
      above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine whether levels of other androgen synthetic enzymes predict responses to agents&#xD;
      targeting the androgen-androgen receptor (AR) signaling axis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine whether intratumoral androgen levels are increased compared to serum levels,&#xD;
      and whether they correlate with androgen synthetic enzyme levels and/or responses to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine whether time to progression on therapy correlates with androgen biosynthetic&#xD;
      enzymes or hormone levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine whether gene expression profiling can predict response and time to progression&#xD;
      for chemotherapy or targeted agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Identify immune B and/or T cell markers, sequencing and/or antibodies that may correlate&#xD;
      with response, time to progression and/or overall survival for patients undergoing&#xD;
      immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo collection of blood and tissue samples for analysis via mutation mapping,&#xD;
      DNA sequencing, gene expression microarray, and gene profiling.&#xD;
