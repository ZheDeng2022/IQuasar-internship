      The purpose of this study is to learn more about the management of white spot lesions that&#xD;
      occur after orthodontic treatment. White spot lesions generally improve slightly with time.&#xD;
      To date, there is no proven method to help white spot lesions improve faster. Two treatments,&#xD;
      called MI Paste Plus and fluoride varnish, have shown some potential benefits in a laboratory&#xD;
      setting but have not undergone testing in a clinical setting. Approximately 240 subjects are&#xD;
      to be enrolled in this study. The study will take place in approximately 30 dental and&#xD;
      orthodontic offices across Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Utah, and Washington as part of Northwest&#xD;
      PRECEDENT, a five-state research network that was created to study the practical issues&#xD;
      facing dentists/orthodontists and their patients, and to provide information that will&#xD;
      improve the quality of oral health care as a whole. Researchers at the University of&#xD;
      Washington and Oregon Health &amp; Science University share management and oversight of the&#xD;
      network and research projects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      White spot lesions (WSL), caused by the decalcification of enamel, are a common and&#xD;
      unfortunate sequela of orthodontic treatment. If not addressed, WSL may progress to caries&#xD;
      and frank cavitation of the enamel surface. Once formed, white spot lesions compromise&#xD;
      esthetics and can be extremely difficult or even impossible to reverse. Many clinicians&#xD;
      consider a high-dose fluoride application to be the first step in treatment of WSL in order&#xD;
      to arrest areas of decalcification. However, some believe that while remineralization with&#xD;
      high levels of fluoride may repair the surface of enamel, it may possibly block&#xD;
      remineralization of the deeper areas of enamel. This, in turn, may hamper efforts to&#xD;
      normalize the appearance of WSL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) containing products are a&#xD;
      recently proposed therapy for the treatment of white spots following orthodontic treatment.&#xD;
      CPP is thought to stabilize and localize calcium, fluoride, and phosphate at the tooth&#xD;
      surface in a slow-release amorphous form, thus enhancing deeper remineralization of WSL.&#xD;
      Products containing CPP-ACP are currently marketed under various names, including MI Paste&#xD;
      Plus (which also contains fluoride). Few in vivo studies have investigated the effectiveness&#xD;
      of various remineralization products to address WSL after orthodontics. This project is a&#xD;
      single-blind, randomized clinical trial with three arms - MI Paste Plus for an 8-week&#xD;
      duration, a single application of Duraphat Fluoride Varnish with reassessment at 8 weeks, and&#xD;
      normal home care for an 8 week period. Subjects will be recruited at their regularly&#xD;
      scheduled orthodontic appointments, with eligible subjects being up to 2 years post-removal&#xD;
      of fixed orthodontic appliances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is intended to answer four questions regarding the management of white spot&#xD;
      lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: to compare the effectiveness MI Paste Plus and Duraphat Fluoride Varnish to a&#xD;
      standard oral hygiene/toothpaste regimen in improving the appearance of WSL after orthodontic&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: to investigate subjects' self-assessment of improvement in each of the three&#xD;
      arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: to investigate variables (such as age, gender, time since fixed orthodontic&#xD;
      appliance removal, compliance, oral hygiene practices, etc) that may influence WSL&#xD;
      improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 4: to investigate the short-term changes in WSL from the day of orthodontic&#xD;
      appliance removal until the day of retainer delivery (usually 2 - 7 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide valuable evidence on the management of WSL after orthodontic&#xD;
      treatment. As previously stated, WSL lesions are quite common and difficult to reverse, so it&#xD;
      is important to conduct rigorous clinical research in an effort to develop effective&#xD;
      strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a randomized clinical trial. NW PRECEDENT providers will invite subjects&#xD;
      to participate if they are between the ages of 12 and 20 and have at least one new WSL on the&#xD;
      4 maxillary incisors associated with orthodontic treatment. These are the most common teeth&#xD;
      to develop these lesions. The NW PRECEDENT provider must verify that the WSL were not present&#xD;
      in the pre-orthodontic treatment records. Subjects must be willing to be placed into any of&#xD;
      the following three groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Test Group A: 10% CPP-ACP + 900 ppm Fluoride paste - a trained staff member from the NW&#xD;
           PRECEDENT dental/orthodontic office will give 3 tubes of MI Paste Plus and instructions&#xD;
           to the subject for home use. The subjects will also receive non-prescription fluoride&#xD;
           toothpaste (1100 ppm Fluoride) and oral hygiene instructions. The group will consist of&#xD;
           80 subjects, and each subject will be given enough MI Paste for the duration of the&#xD;
           trial. Treatment will begin on the day of retainer delivery if the subject was recruited&#xD;
           on the day of fixed appliance removal. Otherwise, the treatment will begin on the date&#xD;
           of recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Test Group B: Fluoride Varnish Group - a trained staff member from the NW PRECEDENT&#xD;
           dental/orthodontic office will provide a single fluoride varnish application (22,600 ppm&#xD;
           Fluoride) to the subject. The subjects will also receive non-prescription fluoride&#xD;
           toothpaste (1100 ppm Fluoride) and oral hygiene instructions. The group will consist of&#xD;
           80 subjects. Treatment will begin on the day of retainer delivery if the subject was&#xD;
           recruited on the day of fixed appliance removal. Otherwise, the treatment will begin on&#xD;
           the date of recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Control Group - These 80 subjects will receive non-prescription fluoride toothpaste&#xD;
           (1100 ppm Fluoride) and oral hygiene instructions at the time of enrollment. After the&#xD;
           trial is completed (~ August 2011), these subjects will be informed of the results, and&#xD;
           offered one of the two active arms, if they are found to be effective in reducing WSL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NW PRECEDENT provider and the subject will also fill out a short survey to compile&#xD;
      information about the subject's age, gender, race, ethnicity, time in fixed appliances, oral&#xD;
      hygiene during treatment, and type of retainers after orthodontic treatment. Upon determining&#xD;
      a subject's eligibility and willingness to participate, as well as obtaining assent/consent,&#xD;
      he/she will be randomly assigned to a group, a baseline photograph will be taken, and the&#xD;
      assigned treatment will begin. In the case of subjects who have just had their orthodontic&#xD;
      appliances removed, the subjects will undergo enrollment and photos, but their assigned&#xD;
      treatment will not begin until the day of retainer delivery. The subject's general dentist&#xD;
      (if they did not perform their orthodontic care) will be sent a letter informing them that&#xD;
      their patients are currently enrolled in the study, and that any additional treatment for&#xD;
      white spot lesions should be delayed until the study is complete (8 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who are identified at some time after their fixed orthodontic appliances have been&#xD;
      removed will have baseline photographs taken on the day of recruitment. Subjects who are&#xD;
      identified on the day their appliances are removed will have photographs taken on that day,&#xD;
      as well at the time of retainer delivery (2 - 7 days later). A subsequent analysis of the day&#xD;
      of fixed appliance removal and one week follow-up photographs will be performed, in order to&#xD;
      determine if significant changes are evident during this short period immediately after fixed&#xD;
      appliance removal. This is being investigated because portions of the teeth under the braces&#xD;
      have been shielded from the oral cavity for several years, and they may also have been&#xD;
      desiccated during the removal of braces. Additionally, the gums may be puffy and swollen&#xD;
      immediately after taking braces off, and parts of the teeth may not be visible. The&#xD;
      photographs will be sent to the online data capture system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the eight-week time point, NW PRECEDENT providers will recall the subjects (240 total) and&#xD;
      take the eight-week follow-up photographs in the same standardized format as the baseline&#xD;
      photographs. The photographs will be sent via the online data capture system. The NW&#xD;
      PRECEDENT provider will administer an in office survey to the subject to gather information&#xD;
      regarding satisfaction with using the treatment, compliance, oral hygiene practices, and&#xD;
      self-assessment of improvement of the WSL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group of blinded examiners consisting of five to ten laypersons and five to ten dental&#xD;
      experts will view each subject's set of digital photographs in chronological order on a&#xD;
      PowerPoint presentation. The photographs will only show the four maxillary incisor teeth and&#xD;
      will be unidentifiable to the examiners. Each set of photographs will then be given an&#xD;
      improvement rating on a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) (0=no improvement, 100=100%&#xD;
      improvement). In addition, both a graduate orthodontic resident and a dental student will&#xD;
      blindly assess the digital photographs by measuring the size of the white spot lesion&#xD;
      relative to the rest of the tooth expressed as a percent. Statistical analysis will then be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
