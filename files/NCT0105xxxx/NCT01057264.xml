      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of Abraxane速&#xD;
      (nab-paclitaxel) when given directly into the liver, in combination with Gemzar速&#xD;
      (gemcitabine) and Avastin速 (bevacizumab) when given by vein.&#xD;

      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nab-paclitaxel is designed to block cancer cells from dividing, which may cause the cancer&#xD;
      cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gemcitabine is designed to disrupt the growth of cancer cells, which may cause cancer cells&#xD;
      to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab is designed to block the growth of blood vessels that supply the nutrients needed&#xD;
      for tumor growth, which may prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells. Bevacizumab is&#xD;
      no longer FDA approved to treat breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose&#xD;
      level of the combination of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine based on when you join this study.&#xD;
      Up to 6 dose levels of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine will be tested. All participants will&#xD;
      receive the same dose level of bevacizumab, regardless of when you join the study. Between&#xD;
      3-6 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of participants will&#xD;
      receive the lowest dose level of the combination of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine in&#xD;
      combination with bevacizumab. Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group before&#xD;
      it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable&#xD;
      dose of the combination of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine given in combination with&#xD;
      bevacizumab is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the highest tolerable dose is found, up to 12 additional participants receive this dose.&#xD;
      This is called the expansion group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Catheter Placement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of each 21-day study cycle, a catheter (a sterile, flexible tube) will be placed&#xD;
      into a large artery that carries blood to the liver in your groin area, on the right side of&#xD;
      the body. The area where the catheter will be placed will first be numbed with local&#xD;
      anesthetic. The catheter will be taped in place to prevent it from moving or coming out while&#xD;
      you are receiving nab-paclitaxel. You will lie flat on your back while receiving the study&#xD;
      drug, and you will be on bedrest until the catheter is removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The doctor who performs the catheter placement procedure will explain it to you in more&#xD;
      detail, and you will be asked to sign a separate consent form that describes the catheter&#xD;
      placement procedure and its risks in more detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the catheter is in place, you will receive heparin, a drug that is used to help prevent&#xD;
      blood clots. Heparin will be started as soon as the catheter is placed and will continue for&#xD;
      up to 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The catheter will be removed right after you receive nab-paclitaxel. While the catheter is&#xD;
      being removed, the study staff will apply pressure to your groin area for 15 minutes in order&#xD;
      to stop the bleeding. The catheter will be in place for about 1 hour, or until the&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel administration is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nab-paclitaxel will be given through the catheter into the artery that carries blood to your&#xD;
      liver nonstop for 1 hour starting on Day 1 of each cycle. If the study doctor thinks it is&#xD;
      needed, you will be given drugs by vein to lower the risk of nausea before each dose as part&#xD;
      of your standard, routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gemcitabine will be given by vein over 1 hour on Days 1 and 8 of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab will be given by vein on Day 1 of each cycle. The first time you receive&#xD;
      bevacizumab, it will be given over 90 minutes. If you tolerate it well, the rest of the doses&#xD;
      will be given over 30-60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you do not tolerate the study drug combination well, the doses that you receive may be&#xD;
      lowered. If you experience certain side effects, the study drug doses may be delayed and that&#xD;
      study cycle may last longer than 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting at least 24 hours after the you receive the study drug on Day 1, you will receive&#xD;
      Neupogen速 (filgrastim) through a needle injected under the skin. You will continue to receive&#xD;
      filgrastim for 3 days (Days 2-4). Filgrastim is being given to help prevent possible side&#xD;
      effects related to the other study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will stay in the hospital for up to 7 days (Days 1-7 of each cycle) at the beginning of&#xD;
      each cycle, until you recover from any side effects that you may experience. You will be seen&#xD;
      by a doctor or &quot;advanced practice&quot; nurse every day while you are in the hospital to check on&#xD;
      how you are recovering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of each cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to test your blood's ability&#xD;
           to clot, and tumor marker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 2 of each cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 2 cycles, or at any time the study doctor thinks it is needed, women who are able to&#xD;
      become pregnant will have a urine pregnancy test. To remain on this study, the pregnancy test&#xD;
      must be negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of every 2 cycles (Cycles 2, 4, 6, and so on), or at any time the study doctor&#xD;
      thinks it is needed, a chest x-ray, CT scan, MRI scan, PET scan and/or PET/CT scan will be&#xD;
      performed to check the status of the disease. After 10 cycles of study drug treatment, you&#xD;
      may have scans every 3 cycles instead of 2 cycles, if your doctor feels that this is in your&#xD;
      best interest. If the study doctor thinks it is better for you, other types of scans that&#xD;
      have not been listed here may be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six (6) weeks after the last dose of the study drug combination, or if you stop taking the&#xD;
      study drug combination for any reason, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to test your blood's&#xD;
           ability to clot.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, a chest x-ray, CT scan, MRI scan, PET scan&#xD;
           and/or PET/CT scan will be performed to check the status of the disease. If the study&#xD;
           doctor thinks it is better for you, other types of scans that have not been listed here&#xD;
           may be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue taking the study drug combination for as long as the doctor thinks it is in&#xD;
      your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets&#xD;
      worse or intolerable side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Nab-paclitaxel is FDA approved and commercially available&#xD;
      when given by vein for the treatment of breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gemcitabine is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer, breast cancer that is metastatic (has spread to other parts of the body), non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer (NSCL), and ovarian cancer. Bevacizumab is FDA approved and commercially&#xD;
      available for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, NSCL, and a type of brain cancer&#xD;
      called glioblastoma multiforme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Giving nab-paclitaxel into an artery that carries blood directly into the liver is&#xD;
      investigational. Using the study drug combination for treating advanced cancer that has&#xD;
      spread to the liver is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 80 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
