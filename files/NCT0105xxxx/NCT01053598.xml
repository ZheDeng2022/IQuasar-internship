      The Principle objective of this study is To evaluate the performance of NRA, NRA-p and REMA-p&#xD;
      for the detection of M. tuberculosis complex from sputum samples from adult pulmonary TB&#xD;
      suspects in a high TB and HIV prevalence setting, using LJ and MGIT culture as gold standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the performance of each assay (NRA, NRA-p, REMA-p) in sputum smear-negative&#xD;
           patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the results of the colorimetric methods in HIV-positive and HIV-negative&#xD;
           patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the time to detection of both NRA/NRA-p, REMA-p methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the feasibility of the NRA, NRA-p, REMA-p methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the rate of contamination of the NRA, NRA-p and REMA-p assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the proportion and the clinical relevance of NTM among TB suspects in a high&#xD;
           TB and HIV prevalence setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To provide capacity building for TB diagnosis in Mbarara.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) remains a leading cause of death in developing countries and its burden has&#xD;
      been exacerbated by the concurrent HIV epidemic. Despite the advances in medicine, TB&#xD;
      diagnosis still remains a challenge, especially in developing countries where diagnosis&#xD;
      relies mostly on the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) by smear&#xD;
      microscopy and/or culture. Smear microscopy is rapid, simple and not expensive but it lacks&#xD;
      sensitivity. Culture on solid medium, which is performed in some well equipped laboratories,&#xD;
      is more sensitive than microscopy but takes up to 8 weeks to obtain the result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colorimetric methods have been used for the rapid detection of drug sensitivity in M.&#xD;
      tuberculosis either from isolates or directly from sputum. These methods rely on the&#xD;
      detection of live bacteria through either enzymatic activity (nitrate reduction) or their&#xD;
      ability to reduce an oxidation-reduction indicator, either in solid or liquid medium. They&#xD;
      are fast, simple, and offer a good potential that should be evaluated for the diagnosis of&#xD;
      TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of colorimetric assays for the&#xD;
      detection of M. tuberculosis complex from sputum samples from adult pulmonary TB suspects in&#xD;
      a high TB and HIV prevalence setting, using LÃ¶wenstein Jensen (LJ) and Mycobacterium growth&#xD;
      indicator tube (MGIT) culture as gold standard. The colorimetric methods evaluated here will&#xD;
      be the solid medium-based nitrate reductase assay as described (NRA) or with an additional&#xD;
      step using para Nitrobenzoic (PNB) acid for differentiation of MTBC and NTM (NRA-p), and the&#xD;
      modified resazurin microplate assay, also using PNB for differentiation of MTBC and NTM&#xD;
      (REMA-p).&#xD;
&#xD;
      . If any of the colorimetric assays is found to be accurate, significantly faster than&#xD;
      conventional culture methods, and easy to perform, then it could be implemented in a&#xD;
      tuberculosis culture laboratory. By reducing the time to detection compared to conventional&#xD;
      culture and the costs compared to recent commercial methods, these assays offer a good&#xD;
      alternative to conventional methods and might help to improve TB diagnosis in developing&#xD;
      countries.&#xD;
