      Women of reproductive age who will undergo cancer treatment may participate in a study to&#xD;
      surgically remove ovarian tissue and store it, frozen, for their potential use in the future.&#xD;
      20% of collected tissue will be used for research.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy and radiation therapy for cancer can compromise the ability to become pregnant.&#xD;
      Experiments in animals and humans have tried to collect, freeze and store eggs to see if they&#xD;
      can be saved for possible later use. While studies are promising, it is still uncertain&#xD;
      whether such approaches will ultimately prove to be useful in practice for achieving&#xD;
      pregnancy in humans. The main purpose of this study is to see whether it is possible to&#xD;
      remove and store ovarian tissues by freezing. It is hoped that, in the future, frozen, stored&#xD;
      ovarian tissue can be used to achieve pregnancy. Before receiving chemotherapy or radiation&#xD;
      therapy, subjects will have a piece of the ovaries, or one of two ovaries, removed by&#xD;
      surgery. The tissues will be frozen by a special method in an effort to prevent the eggs from&#xD;
      being damaged. The majority (80%) of the tissue will be stored for potential use in case the&#xD;
      patient is unable to achieve pregnancy in the future, and part of the tissue (20%) will be&#xD;
      used for studying how the eggs can be grown in the laboratory.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patient between the ages of 18 and 42 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In need of imminent cancer treatment, including surgery, chemotherapy or radiation&#xD;
             therapy, which is viewed as likely to result in a permanent and complete loss of&#xD;
             subsequent ovarian function or have a health condition that will result in premature&#xD;
             ovarian failure. These include, but are not limited to: abdominopelvic irradiation,&#xD;
             total body irradiation, alkylating-intensive chemotherapy, and removal of ovaries as&#xD;
             part of their cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Reasonably good health.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Two ovaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to defer definitive cancer therapy for approximately 3 days until the patient&#xD;
             recovers from laparoscopic oophorectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients considered as high risk for surgical complications will be excluded from the&#xD;
             research protocol.&#xD;
