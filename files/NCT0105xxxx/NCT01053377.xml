  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of severe morbidity and mortality following an influenza infection during the&#xD;
      annual influenza epidemics is highest among the elderly population and 90% of&#xD;
      influenzaassociated mortality occurs in this group. Vaccination is considered the best&#xD;
      preventive intervention available but offers only partial protection. The protective effect&#xD;
      decreases with advancing age and existing co-morbidity. Therefore, in spite of high&#xD;
      compliance with vaccination, the risk of influenza-related complications among nursing-home&#xD;
      residents, is particularly high, and consequently also the associated disease and economic&#xD;
      burden. There is debate on the potential health benefit of the antiviral activity of&#xD;
      oseltamivir as an effective supplementary intervention to prevent or contain influenza&#xD;
      outbreaks in nursing homes. Although effectiveness of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with&#xD;
      oseltamivir on preventing transmission has been demonstrated in trials among healthy (mainly&#xD;
      unvaccinated) adults and children, effectiveness has not yet been assessed among vulnerable&#xD;
      vaccinated highrisk groups, such as the elderly population in nursing homes. If proven&#xD;
      (cost)effective, oseltamivir could have considerable benefits in this setting, although&#xD;
      constraints relating to implementation need to be addressed as well.&#xD;

      Objective If proven (cost)effective, without inducing antiviral resistance, oseltamivir could&#xD;
      have considerable benefits in this setting, although constraints relating to implementation&#xD;
      need to be addressed as well. If not (cost)effective if this fragile population, resources&#xD;
      can be better spent on other activities to support nursing home residents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomised controlled trial on the effect of PEP with oseltamivir versus placebo on&#xD;
      transmission of influenza in nursing homes, linked to virological monitoring of possible&#xD;
      development of resistance and impact on transmission and outcome, linked with a cost&#xD;
      effectiveness analysis, and an exploration of logistical and ethical issues which could&#xD;
      interfere with successful implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will be nested in the recently established Network of Nursing Homes (SNIV). SNIV&#xD;
      has been initiated and is coordinated by the RIVM Centre of Infectious Disease Control.&#xD;
      Baseline data on the population in these nursing homes is already routinely collected, and&#xD;
      epidemiological and virological surveillance of ILI/influenza is established, in&#xD;
      collaboration with the local laboratories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-exposition prophylaxis with oseltamivir or placebo. Once laboratory confirmation has&#xD;
      been obtained in an index case, all residents of that implicated unit only will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to PEP with either oseltamivir 75 mg or placebo once daily for 10 days. Data on&#xD;
      co-morbidity, medication and other potential confounders for susceptibility to a clinical&#xD;
      influenza infection will be collected prior to the start of PEP. The index patient (and any&#xD;
      secondary patients) will be treated therapeutically with oseltamivir. Main study&#xD;
      parameters/endpoints: Transmission, the primary trial outcome measurement, is defined as a&#xD;
      newly laboratory confirmed influenza in the same unit 12 hours or more after the start of&#xD;
      PEP. Assuming 30 homes participate, that annually 30% of nursinghomes experience a confirmed&#xD;
      influenza outbreak in on average two units, than we can recruit 20 units per season. Assuming&#xD;
      that without effective prophylaxis ongoing transmission occurs in 40% of the units, we will&#xD;
      have at least 80% power after 3 seasons with a two-sided alpha=0.05 to demonstrate a&#xD;
      reduction in transmission of 70%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, this trial offers an excellent opportunity to evaluate the possible emergence of&#xD;
      resistance against oseltamivir if used under such circumstances, by analysing the occurrence&#xD;
      of viral mutations under oseltamivir therapy (for index- and for any secondary cases). In&#xD;
      addition, we will assess the relative cost-effectiveness of PEP with oseltamivir per nursing&#xD;
      home unit, compared to not using PEP by prospectively collecting information on the number of&#xD;
      influenza infections and related complications, duration of symptoms, use of medical services&#xD;
      by secondary cases, as well as sickness leave of staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, potential ethical and logistical restrictions for the large scale use of oseltamivir&#xD;
      will be documented prospectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Burden and risks of this trial will be minimal, as we will not deviate from current standing&#xD;
      practices, in which some nursing homes offer PEP and others don't, following the diagnosis of&#xD;
      influenza on a unit.&#xD;
