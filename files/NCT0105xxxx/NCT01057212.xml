  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open-label, single arm phase II trial of the combination of&#xD;
      bevacizumab and ixabepilone in patients with advanced- or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC&#xD;
      progressive after first or second-line therapy. The main objective is to evaluate the&#xD;
      progression-free survival in patients with advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC being&#xD;
      treated with ixabepilone and bevacizumab.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first six patients will be enrolled in a lead-in phase of the study utilizing a reduced&#xD;
      dose of ixabepilone. Patients will be monitored for safety and toxicity. If the combination&#xD;
      is found to be tolerable and feasible, accrual will continue with the full-dose regimen.&#xD;
      Toxicity will be monitored in real-time by the study investigators. Should unexpected or&#xD;
      increased toxicity be detected, trial accrual will be halted for full analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab will be administered intravenously, 10 mg/kg, every two weeks. Ixabepilone will&#xD;
      be administered intravenously, 16 mg/m2, once weekly for 3 of 4 weeks on a 28-day schedule,&#xD;
      to the first six patients enrolled. Ixabepilone will be administered intravenously, 20mg/m2,&#xD;
      once weekly for 3 of 4 weeks on a 28-day schedule, to the remaining 40 patients enrolled.&#xD;
