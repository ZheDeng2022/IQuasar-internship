      Placebo control in acupuncture research is challenging and difficult. The primary objective&#xD;
      of the study is to explore a study design comparing stimulation by real acupuncture needle,&#xD;
      sham acupuncture needle and laser. The research question is whether a patient is capable of&#xD;
      discriminate different stimulation modality when studying acupuncture stimulation for nausea&#xD;
      in early pregnancy. The study is planned as a pilot study including 20 women in each of the&#xD;
      three study groups, all-together 60 pregnant women. Intervention will consist of standardised&#xD;
      15 minutes stimulation of acupuncture point pericardium 6 by, either two acupuncture needles,&#xD;
      two sham acupuncture needle or two laser devices. All participating women are told that they&#xD;
      will get different stimulation at an acupuncture point with potential effect on nausea. The&#xD;
      women will record their daily symptoms during a 4 day run-in period, a 3 day intervention&#xD;
      period, and thereafter a 4 day follow-up period after treatment in accordance with previous&#xD;
      research methodology. In addition, the women will record how they experience the three&#xD;
      different stimulations of acupuncture points. The results from the study could be important&#xD;
      for planning of future studies where the blinding issue with regard to acupuncture is&#xD;
      challenged.&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a randomized, prospective pilot study testing if acupuncture, sham&#xD;
      acupuncture, and laser stimulation all are useful means in preventing nausea and/or vomiting&#xD;
      in early pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The acu-stimulation will be performed during at a standardised regimen using acupuncture&#xD;
      point PC 6 bilaterally. The placebo needle will be placed in the same position at PC 6&#xD;
      bilaterally, however not penetrating the surface of the skin. The third group of women will&#xD;
      have a laser pointing at PC 6. All the patients will achieve exactly the same, standardised&#xD;
      information and counselling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to birth rate-statistics there should be approximately 7000 annual pregnancies in&#xD;
      Oslo area. Prevalence is estimated to be approximately 0,75. According to this, there should&#xD;
      be at least 5000 pregnant women suffering from nausea and/or vomiting each year, and at least&#xD;
      400 each month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is likely to assume that only 50 % of pregnant women suffering from nausea and/or vomiting&#xD;
      do want any kind of therapy for their complaints (i.e. 200/month). If another 10% of these&#xD;
      again respond to advertisements and agree to inclusion in an acupuncture study, this will&#xD;
      ensure an adequate number of subjects for the study within the three-month study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women in their first trimester will be recruited through advertisements in media&#xD;
      and/or flyers made available by all general practitioners, all pharmacies and all clinics&#xD;
      caring for pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation is performed in blocks, in order to eliminate confounders of personnel- or&#xD;
      structural nature. In the study we will use a randomisation system with variable block sizes.&#xD;
      The randomisation procedure will be preformed by closed envelopes in a row.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
      We wish to administer the anti-nausea therapy at a standardised intervention. The patients&#xD;
      will receive all together three sessions on three consecutive days for all three stimulation&#xD;
      modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acupuncture may be associated with adverse effects, but is, nevertheless, regarded as&#xD;
      relatively safe when performed according to best practice. However, minor punctuate&#xD;
      haemorrhages as well as local discomfort may occur. Any adverse event or side effect is&#xD;
      monitored according to registration by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The women are informed about the study both in a written letter and verbally at time of&#xD;
      inclusion. Information is given regarding the use of randomisation and the study focusing on&#xD;
      the different stimulation modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 women are included, divided into three groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ACUPUNTURE GROUP The acupuncture needles are inserted in PC 6 bilaterally at the&#xD;
           acupuncture point Pericardium 6 (PC6) on each forearm (fig 2). According to the &quot;cun&quot;&#xD;
           measurement system of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the points are located on the&#xD;
           palmar surface of anterior forearm at a distance equivalent to the combined width of the&#xD;
           women's middle three fingers, proximal to the most prominent wrist crease, and between&#xD;
           the tendons of palmaris longus and flexor carpi radialis. We try to keep the depth of&#xD;
           the needling to approximately 1,5 cm. At insertion of the acupuncture needle, DeQi is&#xD;
           obtained and the needle is then left without any further manipulation/ stimulation (even&#xD;
           method) in situ for 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. SHAM ACUPUNCTURE GROUP A sham acupuncture needle is placed at PC 6 bilaterally and the&#xD;
           tactile stimuli of the skin during the procedure should be obtained. The sham&#xD;
           acupuncture needle is then left at site for 15 minutes without any further&#xD;
           manipulation/stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. LASER ACUPUNCTURE A laser is placed in a stand, pointing at PC 6 bilaterally, and left&#xD;
           at site for 15 minutes without any further manipulation/stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effect on nausea and/or vomiting is supposed to occur within minutes or few hours. All women&#xD;
      included in the study should record their symptoms in a run-in period of 4 days before&#xD;
      therapy (day 1-4). The days of therapy is supposed to be day 5-7. They thereafter record&#xD;
      symptoms on the 4 consecutive days (day 8-11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At enrollment, the women will be asked about background variables as well as factors that&#xD;
      possibly could affect the outcome of the research. During the whole study period of 11 days,&#xD;
      the women are told to record their symptoms according to previous research methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are asked to make three recordings of their symptoms every evening. The first&#xD;
      registration is to determine what problems had had the particular day; 1= no problems,&#xD;
      2=nausea and 3=vomiting, regardless of how often and how many times they vomited. In the&#xD;
      second registration, the women are asked to estimate how many hours they had suffered each&#xD;
      day. In the third registration the women also estimate an overall evaluation of severity&#xD;
      their symptoms on a visual analogue scale (VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every woman participates in the study for 12 consecutive days consisting of a 4 day run-in&#xD;
      period, a 3 day treatment period, a 4 day follow up period, and one last day of an ending&#xD;
      interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The programme for these days is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 0: Day of contact. The woman starts registration of symptoms the next day. Day 1-4: The&#xD;
      women register their symptoms every evening. Day 5: Randomization. Day 5-7: The women are&#xD;
      treated once daily with one of the three treatments they are randomized to get. The women&#xD;
      register how they experience the stimulation of the acupuncture points within one hour after&#xD;
      the treatment. The women also register their symptoms of nausea and vomiting every evening.&#xD;
      Day 8-11: The women register their symptoms every evening. Dag 12: The woman is phoned and&#xD;
      asked to participate in an ending interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will also be collected with regard to how the women experienced the three different&#xD;
      stimulations of the acupuncture points, how and if they obtained the needle-feeling (De Qi),&#xD;
      and how and if the consider the treatment effected their condition. The patients are also&#xD;
      asked to state credibility of the stimulation and to describe DeQi.&#xD;
