  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carbon monoxide poisoning is common. Many adults with CO poisoning have long-term, even&#xD;
      permanent brain injury following poisoning. However, very little is known about the long-term&#xD;
      outcome of children with carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. In this study we plan to perform&#xD;
      cognitive (thinking) and vestibular (balance) testing in children (ages 6 to 16)at 6 weeks&#xD;
      and 6 months following CO poisoning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 6-week visit, if the child and parents agree, we will ask each child to provide a DNA&#xD;
      sample by one of three methods: mouthwash, spit collection, or swabbing the inside of the&#xD;
      child's cheek. Each child's DNA will be analyzed for genes that are known to affect outcome&#xD;
      following brain injury.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Each child's participation in this study is expected to last 6 months. Testing will be&#xD;
      scheduled around 6 weeks after the carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning episode. During testing,&#xD;
      each child will be asked to complete tests that measure cognitive (thinking), emotional, and&#xD;
      behavioral performance. We will collect information from each child's medical record about&#xD;
      the CO poisoning episode, and we will have a parent complete a questionnaire about any&#xD;
      problems he or she may have observed in their child since the poisoning. The cognitive&#xD;
      testing will take about 3.5 hours at the 6-week interval, and 2.5 hours at the 6-month&#xD;
      interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Around the same time, each child will also be scheduled for vestibular (balance) testing at&#xD;
      the Intermountain Hearing and Balance Center. Vestibular testing will occur twice, at 6-weeks&#xD;
      and 6-months following poisoning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 6-week visit, if the child and parents agree, we will ask each child to provide a DNA&#xD;
      sample by one of three methods: mouthwash, spit collection, or swabbing the inside of the&#xD;
      child's cheek. Each child's DNA will be analyzed for genes that are known to affect outcome&#xD;
      following brain injury such as apolipoprotein E, and the sample will also be stored for an&#xD;
      indefinite period of time. If discoveries are made about other genes that affect outcome&#xD;
      following brain injury, each child's DNA will be analyzed for those genes as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be the percentage of patients with cognitive sequelae&#xD;
      (thinking complications or results) at 6 weeks and 6 months following CO poisoning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondarily, we will also determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Which individual neurocognitive (thinking) outcomes at 6 weeks and 6 months differ from&#xD;
           normative data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Whether there is a difference in neurocognitive (thinking) outcomes between measurement&#xD;
           at 6 weeks and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If there is a difference in the vestibular (balance) health of patients between&#xD;
           measurements at 6 weeks and 6 months.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Age 6 through 16.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Acute carbon monoxide poisoning. Since we will be identifying potentially eligible&#xD;
             patients using an electronic tool, the diagnosis of CO poisoning should be established&#xD;
             by the evaluating physician. However, with the initial contact with the patients'&#xD;
             parents, we will confirm the diagnosis, and only those patients with CO poisoning will&#xD;
             be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Willing to come to Salt Lake City or Provo for evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Prior history of neurological injury with permanent sequelae.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Prior history of chronic neurological disorder such as attention deficit disorder,&#xD;
             learning disability, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, demyelinating disease,&#xD;
             meningitis with sequelae&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Insulin dependent diabetes (due to the confound of possible brain microvascular&#xD;
             disease and episodes of hypoglycemia)&#xD;
