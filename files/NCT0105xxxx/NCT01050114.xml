  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overactive bladder is a condition associated with symptoms of feeling the urge to urinate,&#xD;
      urinating often, and may or may not be accompanied by leakage of urine. A patient who has a&#xD;
      spinal cord injury (SCI) often suffers from an overactive bladder which often leads to&#xD;
      urinary incontinence (UI - an unwanted leakage of urine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OnaBoNT-A bladder injections have been studied in clinical research trials. The results have&#xD;
      shown an improvement in urinary symptoms by reducing how often urine leakage occurs and by&#xD;
      increasing the amount of urine the bladder can hold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This purpose of this clinical trial is to see if onaBoNT-A is safe and effective when&#xD;
      injected into the bladder for the treatment of UI and if it works better than a drug that is&#xD;
      taken by mouth. A second purpose of the study is to perform research tests on the urine&#xD;
      samples provided by the volunteers. Urine presents a rich source of information for bladder&#xD;
      diseases and the biomarkers (the chemical make-up of the urine cells) will be examined to&#xD;
      learn if there are yet undiscovered reasons for urinary diseases. These tests would be very&#xD;
      beneficial because the results would lead to better treatment of the urinary diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be randomized to either: ARM 1: onaBoNT-A 200 U bladder injection and placebo&#xD;
      oral capsule daily or ARM 2: Placebo bladder injection (saline) and oxybutynin ER 10mg&#xD;
      capsule twice a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatments are onaBoNT-A bladder injection and a placebo oral capsule once a day or&#xD;
      placebo bladder injection and oxybutynin ER (like Ditropan) capsule twice a day. Placebo&#xD;
      contains no active medicine. Participation in this study will be about 6-7 months and involve&#xD;
      5 visits to the clinic. The risks of bladder onaBoNT-A&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current treatment of neurogenic bladder dysfunction (NGB) is limited by the suboptimal&#xD;
      results achieved using standard antimuscarinic agents. A prominent role for the actions of&#xD;
      alternative transmitters/growth factors in peripheral micturition pathways is emerging from&#xD;
      the growing number of pharmacologic and localization studies in humans. For example, recently&#xD;
      published data demonstrates a significant increased expression of Nerve Growth Factor and&#xD;
      chemokine/cytokine levels in patients with detrusor overactivity and NGB. Treatment with&#xD;
      onabotulinumtoxinA (onaBoNT-A) not only was shown to reduce detrusor overactivity and improve&#xD;
      urinary symptoms but also significantly reduced tissue and urine levels of factors such as&#xD;
      NGF. Up to this point, no study has directly compared the effects of front-line therapy of&#xD;
      antimuscarinic agents versus onaBoNT-A on urinary symptoms in patients with NGB resulting&#xD;
      from spinal cord injury (SCI). In addition, no investigation has examined the effects that&#xD;
      antimuscarinic agents or onaBoNT-A have on urinary levels of NGF and chemokines/cytokines,&#xD;
      whether changes in urinary levels predict a clinical response or a return in symptoms, and if&#xD;
      changes in urinary levels predate changes in clinical response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Access to selective and reliable urine testing of NGF and chemokines/cytokines provides the&#xD;
      unique opportunity to assess the impact that modulating these agents has on bladder function.&#xD;
      The main purpose of this proposal is to incorporate novel urine biomarker testing into&#xD;
      existing clinical methodologies in order to: 1) evaluate the safety and efficacy of 200 U&#xD;
      onaBoNT-A injected into the detrusor versus oral oxybutynin for the treatment of urinary&#xD;
      incontinence (UI) caused by neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) in spinal cord injured&#xD;
      patients and 2) to determine the potential role of urine biomarkers in guiding the process of&#xD;
      patient selection and identify surrogate predictors of treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to assess&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of onaBoNT-A or 10 mg twice a day of oral oxybutynin hydrocholoride&#xD;
      in spinal cord injured patients diagnosed with neurogenic detrusor overactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will include both males and females with spinal cord injuries who are 18 to 80&#xD;
      years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be randomized using a blocked randomization approach to either:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 1: onaBoNT-A 200 U bladder injection and placebo oral capsule daily or&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 2: Placebo bladder injection (saline) and oxybutynin ER 10mg capsule twice a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized into one of the two treatment arms, using a block size of 4. The&#xD;
      order in which the treatments are assigned in each block is randomized and this process is&#xD;
      repeated for consecutive blocks of subjects until all subjects are randomized. This process&#xD;
      ensures that after every fourth randomized subject, the number of subjects in each treatment&#xD;
      group is equal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be five study visits over approximately 6-7 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The significance of these experiments begins with the fact that our proposed intervention is&#xD;
      the first randomized clinical trial comparing the effects of onaBoNT-A (onabotulinumtoxinA)&#xD;
      bladder injection versus anticholinergic medication for detrusor hyperreflexia (DH). In&#xD;
      addition, this is the first study profiling urine levels of the signaling protein nerve&#xD;
      growth factor (NGF) and chemokines/cytokines as possible bio-markers of bladder overactivity&#xD;
      in patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity. Finally, this is the only study to date&#xD;
      comparing the effects that onaBoNT-A or anticholinergic medications have on urine NGF and&#xD;
      chemokine/cytokine levels. If our hypotheses prove to be correct, the significance to&#xD;
      treating patients with spinal cord injury with botulinum toxin A will be less incontinence,&#xD;
      the requirement of lower doses or avoidance of anticholinergic medication and its associated&#xD;
      side effects, and the ability to prevent the complications of DH/DESD (Detrusor-External&#xD;
      Sphincter Dyssynergia) including urinary tract infections, decubiti, and impairment of&#xD;
      quality of life. Although this study as written is of moderate length (i.e. total 4 years),&#xD;
      we hope that by finding significant results, we will be able to capture a longitudinal&#xD;
      history of this population by extending follow-up to a longer duration (i.e. over 10 years).&#xD;
