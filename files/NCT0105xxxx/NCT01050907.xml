  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Treatment Investigational New Drug application was to make miltefosine&#xD;
      available for mucocutaneous leishmaniasis patients presenting in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If entrance criteria were met, subjects with mucosal or cutaneous leishmaniasis received&#xD;
      miltefosine at a targeted dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days. During treatment at weeks 1, 2,&#xD;
      and 4, the patient returned to the treatment facility to be assessed for adverse events.&#xD;
      Blood for transaminase and creatinine values were drawn at the midpoint and at the end of&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients returned to the treatment facility to be examined clinically at 6 weeks (ie, 2 weeks&#xD;
      after the end of therapy), 3 months (2 months after therapy), and 7 months (6 months after&#xD;
      treatment) for mucosal leishmaniasis and cutaneous leishmaniasis patients, and also at 13&#xD;
      months (12 months after treatment) for mucosal leishmaniasis patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with mucosal leishmaniasis or cutaneous leishmaniasis from which Leishmania have&#xD;
      already been identified were potentially eligible to be treated with miltefosine via this&#xD;
      protocol. Treating Physicians with potentially eligible subjects contacted the protocol&#xD;
      Principal Investigator (PI), and received the case report forms (CRF) from the PI. The&#xD;
      Treating Physician completed the screening CRF pages for demographics, medical history,&#xD;
      leishmaniasis history, clinical laboratory results that were available, and identification of&#xD;
      Leishmania in the lesion, and sent the completed CRF pages to the PI. If after PI review, the&#xD;
      subject was potentially eligible for the protocol, the PI sent the protocol, the miltefosine&#xD;
      package insert, the informed consent form, and a blank copy of FDA form 1572 to the Treating&#xD;
      Physician. Although this protocol would have already been approved by a &quot;central&quot;&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board (IRB), if there was an additional need to have the Treating&#xD;
      Physician's local IRB approve the protocol, the Treating Physician would obtain the approval,&#xD;
      and obtain informed consent from the subject. The rest of the laboratory tests were&#xD;
      accomplished so that all screening laboratory tests were completed prior to enrolling a&#xD;
      potential subject. If in the physician's opinion the subject appeared eligible for&#xD;
      enrollment, the Treating Physician sent to the PI the local IRB signature page (if needed),&#xD;
      protocol signature page, informed consent signed by both the subject and the Treating&#xD;
      Physician, the rest of the completed CRF pages for screening, and the form 1572 completed&#xD;
      with the Treating Physician's information plus the Treating Physician's curriculum vitae.&#xD;
      After the PI's review of these forms, the investigational product was sent from the drug&#xD;
      repository to the Treating Physician for that subject's use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment was daily for 28 consecutive days. During treatment at weeks 1, 2, and 4, the&#xD;
      subject returned to the treatment facility to be assessed for adverse events and to receive&#xD;
      additional supply of medication if needed. Compliance with drug administration was assessed&#xD;
      by subject interview and pill count. Blood for transaminase and creatinine values were drawn&#xD;
      at the midpoint and at the end of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects returned to the treatment facility to be examined clinically at Study Week 6, Study&#xD;
      Months 3 and 7 months for mucosal leishmaniasis and cutaneous leishmaniasis subjects, and&#xD;
      also at Study Month 13 for mucosal leishmaniasis subjects.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants With Clinical Cure of Lesions</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6, Month 3, Month 7, and Month 13</time_frame>
    <description>Percent of participants with clinical cure of all lesions. Ulcerated CL lesions were measured for the longest diameter and perpendicular width of ulceration; non-ulcerated lesions were measured for length and width of the raised area. A healed lesion was 100% reduction in lesion area (0x0); a cured lesion was a lesion healed at the Month 7 visit. For subjects with ML, an Ear, Nose, and Throat specialist examined the nasal and oral mucosa. Each site (nasal skin, nasal mucosa, palate, pharynx, larynx) was evaluated for signs of disease (erythema, edema, infiltration, erosion) and graded on a scale: 0=no disease, 1=mild disease, 2=moderate disease, 3=severe disease. Max score was 60 = poor outcome. Clinical response measured as a composite score, the mucosal severity score, which was the sum of the severity scores for each clinical sign at each clinical site of disease. A healed lesion had a score of 0 in absolute value (0% of the entrance score), and clinical cure was lesion is healed.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 7 months for CL; Up to 13 months for ML</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants with adverse events (AEs) by occurrence and severity. The Treating Physician monitored participants for the occurrence of AEs from the time the first investigational product was taken on Day 1 through the end of follow up at Month 7 for CL or Month 13 for ML. For the period between Study Day 1 and Study Week 6 (2 weeks after the end of therapy), all AEs regardless of seriousness or relationship to the investigational product were to be recorded on the case report form (CRF). For the period Week 6 to Month 7 for CL, or Month 13 for ML, only AEs requiring medical attention were recorded on the CRF.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Clinical Cure of Lesions</title>
        <description>Percent of participants with clinical cure of all lesions. Ulcerated CL lesions were measured for the longest diameter and perpendicular width of ulceration; non-ulcerated lesions were measured for length and width of the raised area. A healed lesion was 100% reduction in lesion area (0x0); a cured lesion was a lesion healed at the Month 7 visit. For subjects with ML, an Ear, Nose, and Throat specialist examined the nasal and oral mucosa. Each site (nasal skin, nasal mucosa, palate, pharynx, larynx) was evaluated for signs of disease (erythema, edema, infiltration, erosion) and graded on a scale: 0=no disease, 1=mild disease, 2=moderate disease, 3=severe disease. Max score was 60 = poor outcome. Clinical response measured as a composite score, the mucosal severity score, which was the sum of the severity scores for each clinical sign at each clinical site of disease. A healed lesion had a score of 0 in absolute value (0% of the entrance score), and clinical cure was lesion is healed.</description>

        <description>The number of participants with adverse events (AEs) by occurrence and severity. The Treating Physician monitored participants for the occurrence of AEs from the time the first investigational product was taken on Day 1 through the end of follow up at Month 7 for CL or Month 13 for ML. For the period between Study Day 1 and Study Week 6 (2 weeks after the end of therapy), all AEs regardless of seriousness or relationship to the investigational product were to be recorded on the case report form (CRF). For the period Week 6 to Month 7 for CL, or Month 13 for ML, only AEs requiring medical attention were recorded on the CRF.</description>
