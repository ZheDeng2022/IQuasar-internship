      COMMUNICATION - Feasibility and effectiveness 'Tell-us Cards' in hospital patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective - To investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of 'Tell-us Cards' on&#xD;
           patient participation in basic care in hospital settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Design - Cluster randomised controlled early trial design (Phase 2B, MRC Framework).&#xD;
           Patients of two surgical and two medical wards (n=140) will be included in this study.&#xD;
           Before and after the introduction of the intervention, assessments will take place in&#xD;
           patients and nurses at these wards.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention - The 'Tell-us card' is a tool to elicit patients preferences and needs in&#xD;
           basic care. Patients are invited to write down their specific questions and concerns.&#xD;
           The cards are handed out to patients admitted to the hospital (daily). Patients and&#xD;
           informal caregivers are invited to use the cards to state their preferences. Nurses are&#xD;
           instructed to use the cards as a tool in their dialogue with the patient in making care&#xD;
           plans, during ward rounds or for discharge information sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison - Usual care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary outcome - Patient perception of participation in care (Individualized Care Scale&#xD;
           (ICS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary - Use and content of the 'Tell-us Cards' actions taken by nurses as a&#xD;
           consequence of what patients 'tell them' by means of the 'Tell-us Cards', Quality from&#xD;

      Feasibility and effectiveness of the 'Tell-us Card' Communication Tool on hospital patients'&#xD;
      perception of participation and quality of Care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of 'Tell-us Cards' in basic care is an intervention facilitating communication for&#xD;
      enhanced patient participation in basic care. The effectiveness of the card is tested by&#xD;
      Jangland et al (18) in a population of patients admitted to the hospitals surgical wards. The&#xD;
      use of the 'Tell-us Card' in this patient group resulted in significant improvements in&#xD;
      patients abilities to participate in decisions about their nursing and medical care. In our&#xD;
      study we will investigate feasibility and effectiveness of the 'Tell-us cards' in three&#xD;
      different hospital settings; patients admitted to the hospitals' surgical and medical wards&#xD;
      and in patients attending the hospitals' emergency department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The aim of this study is to investigate feasibility and effectiveness of 'Tell-us Cards'&#xD;
      for patients participation in basic care in three different hospital settings. Description of&#xD;
      the Intervention: The 'Tell-us card' (18) is a tool to elicit patients preferences and needs&#xD;
      in basic care. Patients are invited to write down their specific questions and concerns for&#xD;
      the day or before discharge. 'Tell-us Cards' are handed out on a daily basis to patients&#xD;
      admitted to the hospital. Patients and their informal caregivers are invited to use the&#xD;
      'Tell-us Card' to state their preferences in basic care during their stay in the hospital.&#xD;
      Nurses are instructed to use the 'Tell-us card' as a tool in their dialogue with the patient&#xD;
      in making care plans, during ward rounds or for discharge information sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Feasibility and effectiveness of the 'Tell-us Card' will be tested in a controlled&#xD;
      early trial design (Phase 2B, MRC Framework). Trained nurses will be handing out the 'Tell-us&#xD;
      Cards' on a daily basis to patients admitted to the hospital. Baseline assessments on patient&#xD;
      participation will be conducted at all wards in patients and nurses before the introduction&#xD;
      of the 'Tell-us Cards'. For the baseline assessment; Nurses and patients will be asked to&#xD;
      fill in a questionnaire. The nurses receive a questionnaire in their postbox at the ward they&#xD;
      are working on with an envelope for returning the questionnaire to the researcher. Patients&#xD;
      will be asked to fill in a questionnaire one week after discharge from the hospital or one&#xD;
      week after their visit to the emergency department. Assessment of effects of the intervention&#xD;
      in patients at T1 will start 3 months after the introduction of the 'Tell-us Cards' at the&#xD;
      intervention wards. Nurses will be asked to fill in the questionnaire again 6 months after&#xD;
      they filled in the first questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients &amp; Settings: Hospital patients admitted to two surgical wards and two medical wards&#xD;
      (n=4x35=140) will be included in this study. One surgical ward, one medical ward will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the intervention and control group. Baseline and follow up assessments&#xD;
      will take place in 35 patients per assessment per ward, resulting in 165 assessments at&#xD;
      baseline, and 165 assessments at follow-up. Outcomes: Primary outcome is patient perception&#xD;
      of participation in individualised care. For measurement of patient participation in patients&#xD;
      admitted to the hospital we will use the Individualized Care Scale for patients (19-23).&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will comprehend perception of quality of care, assessed with the Quality&#xD;
      from the Patients' perspective (QPP) questionnaire (24, 25) as well as the use and content of&#xD;
      the 'Tell-us Cards' and the actions taken by nurses as a consequence of what patients 'tell&#xD;
      them' by means of the 'Tell-us Cards'. As generic tools we will use the EQ-5D for measurement&#xD;
      of Quality of life (www.euroqol.org) and one question from the consumer Quality index for&#xD;
      patient experience (www.centrumklantervaringindezorg). Furthermore nurses' perception of&#xD;
      individualised care will be assessed at baseline and follow-up with the Individualized Care&#xD;
      Scale for nurses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: Results are clustered at ward level. We will therefore perform a random effects&#xD;
      regression model to estimate the effects on (surgical and medical) patients' perceptions of&#xD;
      Individualised Care for the intervention versus the usual care group at follow-up. In this&#xD;
      analysis, ward will be entered as random effect, and covariates in the model are patients'&#xD;
      perceptions of Individualised Care at each ward at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive analysis will reveal the topics patients regard as most important during their&#xD;
      stay. A thorough process analysis on the use of the Card en the actions taken as a&#xD;
      consequence of the content of the cards, will give insight in feasibility and effectiveness&#xD;
      of the 'Tell-us Card' in daily practice.&#xD;
