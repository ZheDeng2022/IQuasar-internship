      Because communication and handoff failures are a root cause of two-thirds of &quot;sentinel&#xD;
      events&quot;- serious, often fatal preventable adverse events in hospitals improving handoffs has&#xD;
      been identified by AHRQ and the Joint Commission as a priority in nationwide efforts to&#xD;
      improve patient safety. Comparative Effectiveness Research on handoff tools and processes has&#xD;
      identified specific strategies to improve handoffs and reduce medical errors: 1) team&#xD;
      training; 2) verbal mnemonics; and 3) use of written/computerized tools to supplement verbal&#xD;
      sign-outs. To accelerate residents' use of CER-based handoff practices and improve patient&#xD;
      safety, the investigators are implementing the three inventions above as a Resident Handoff&#xD;
      Bundle (RHB) in eight pediatric hospitals in the United States and Canada.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The I-PASS Study was initiated in response to mounting evidence that communication and&#xD;
      handoff failures are a root cause of two-thirds of &quot;sentinel events&quot; - serious, often fatal,&#xD;
      preventable adverse events in hospitals. The Agency on Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)&#xD;
      and Joint Commission have identified improving handoffs in care as a priority in nationwide&#xD;
      efforts to improve patient safety. Research on handoff tools and processes has identified&#xD;
      team training, introduction of verbal mnemonics, and use of written or computerized tools as&#xD;
      strategies to improve handoffs and reduce medical errors. This study was designed to evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of a resident handoff bundle (RHB) comprised of these three strategies in&#xD;
      addressing medical errors, verbal and written miscommunications, and resident workflow and&#xD;
      satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The US Department of Health and Human Services granted $3 million in funding, with additional&#xD;
      support provided by member institutional and private foundations. A total of nine hospitals&#xD;
      in the United States and Canada will serve as data collection sites for the study (see list&#xD;
      below). Staggered six-month waves of baseline data collection of medical errors and resident&#xD;
      workflow, satisfaction, and miscommunications began in January 2010. Each site has a&#xD;
      six-month wash-in period to implement the RHB intervention before embarking upon an&#xD;
      additional six months of post-intervention data collection. Analysis and dissemination will&#xD;
      begin upon completion of data collection at the last wave of sites in April 2013.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The study will also include direct observation of house staff residents on the medical&#xD;
             service. While implementation of the RHB itself is a QI protocol, the observation and&#xD;
             collection of data from residents is research. We will therefore obtain informed&#xD;
             consent from residents for participation in the research related to the effects on&#xD;
             their care processes and experiences of implementation of the RHB. Participation will&#xD;
             be voluntary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All resident physicians rotating through study teams during the two 6 month periods of&#xD;
             data collection will be included in the study if informed consent is granted. No&#xD;
             resident physicians will be excluded on the basis of age, gender, ethnicity, race, or&#xD;
             other demographic features. We anticipate enrolling a maximum of 70 resident&#xD;
             physicians per site. This number may be significantly less due to the fact that&#xD;
             certain residents may rotate through data collection study units more than once during&#xD;
             the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The only exclusion criteria will be residents who do not rotate through study units&#xD;
             during the data collection periods&#xD;
