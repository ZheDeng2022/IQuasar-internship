  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are different protocols to treat gum diseases. One relevant differential aspect is&#xD;
      related to time. There are protocols that usually takes one to two months to be completed&#xD;
      while other are completed within 24 hours. Although both protocols seem to provide clinically&#xD;
      similar improvements, there are some positive aspects related to the short-term one. Among&#xD;
      them lower number of clinical sessions, easier schedule and costs advantages. However, there&#xD;
      are many other relevant aspects that can be helpful for patients and clinicians decisions&#xD;
      regarding type of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study evaluates if and how clinically effective protocols used to treat periodontitis&#xD;
      affect quality of life related to individual's oral statuses. In addition, the experiences of&#xD;
      fear, anxiety and pain before and after these specific protocols are monitored.&#xD;

      Most randomized controlled clinical trials regarding the effects of non-surgical periodontal&#xD;
      treatment have focused on objective parameters. Their effects on patient-centered variables&#xD;
      have been received very little attention. After determining clinical therapeutic efficacy,&#xD;
      this study compared over 6 months the effects of two different forms of non-surgical&#xD;
      periodontal therapy - scaling and root planing per quadrant (SRP) and one-stage full-mouth&#xD;
      disinfection (FMD) - on scores of quality of life, fear, anxiety and pain of moderate chronic&#xD;
      periodontitis. Initially, the sample size was calculated considering protocols' clinical&#xD;
      efficacy. Specifically for the present study it was verified if the initial sample size would&#xD;
      be enough for analysis of the subjective variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients registered in dental care centers from University of Taubate, Taubate - Sao Paulo,&#xD;
      Brazil and Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte - Minas Gerais, Brazil were&#xD;
      informed about the objectives and methods of the study, being consecutively included in the&#xD;
      study only after signing an informed consent form. Selected participants were randomly&#xD;
      allocated to one of the treatment groups by a closed envelope system. According to the&#xD;
      designated group, participants receive either conventional quadrant scaling in four weekly&#xD;
      sections or full-mouth scaling within 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two experienced trained periodontists carried out debridement procedures of both protocols&#xD;
      with manual Gracey and McCall curettes and Hirschfield files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific validated instruments were used to evaluate subjective variables. Oral Impacts on&#xD;
      Daily Performance (OIDP) and Oral Health and Quality of Life (OHQoL-UK) measured quality of&#xD;
      life while Dental Fear Survey (DFS), Dental Anxiety Scale (DAS) questionnaires and, Visual&#xD;
      Analog Scale (VAS) measured experienced fear, anxiety and pain, respectively.&#xD;
