      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a disorder that can cause plexiform neurofibromas (PNs).&#xD;
      These are tumors that grow along nerves. Some PNs cause serious health problems. PNs often&#xD;
      can t be operated on because of their large size, location, or number. There are no effective&#xD;
      treatments known for people with NF1 and PNs. Researchers want to test if the drug&#xD;
      selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) causes PNs to shrink or slows down their growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test if selumetinib helps treat PNs. To test how the body handles selumetinib and how it&#xD;
      affects peoples symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older with NF1, with an inoperable PN that causes morbidity or is growing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history and physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood, urine, and heart tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eye exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI: They lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PN biopsy: A small piece of the tumor is removed by a large needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will swallow selumetinib capsules every 12 hours for several 28-day cycles. The&#xD;
      capsules are taken with a full glass of water on an empty stomach. Participants may have only&#xD;
      water for 2 hours before and 1 hour after each dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will keep a drug diary. They will continue taking the drug as long as they&#xD;
      tolerate it and their disease doesn t progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have several visits throughout the study. These will include repeats of the&#xD;
      screening tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a final visit after they stop taking selumetinib.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder with an incidence of 1:3500&#xD;
           in the US. One of the cardinal features of NF1 is the development of histologically&#xD;
           benign peripheral nervesheath tumors called plexiform neurofibromas (PN) in 25-40% of&#xD;
           individuals with NF1. Unlike discrete neurofibromas, PN grow along the length of nerves&#xD;
           and involve multiple branches of a nerve. They are a major source of morbidity, causing&#xD;
           disfigurement, impairment of nerve function, pain, and in some cases development of&#xD;
           malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Selumetinib (AZD6244) is a novel orally bioavailable mitogen activated protein kinase&#xD;
           inhibitor, is a specific inhibitor of MEK 1/2, which may mediate anti-tumor effects in&#xD;
           PN by inhibition of downstream signaling of Ras. Selumetinib is currently undergoing&#xD;
           evaluation in adult cancers and children with brain tumors and NF1-related plexiform&#xD;
           neurofibromas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In an NCI phase I trial of selumetinib for children and young adults with NF1 and&#xD;
           inoperable PN we have observed preliminary activity with PN volume decrease in &gt;50% of&#xD;
           patients enrolled. This degree of activity has not been observed in prior trials&#xD;
           directed at PN. While preliminary activity has been seen in most patients enrolled to&#xD;
           date, in several patients who required (Bullet) 1 dose reduction for toxicity, after an&#xD;
           initial volume decrease, the PN volumes appear to be increasing slowly, and in one&#xD;
           patient a nodular appearing lesion is not responding to selumetinib. These findings&#xD;
           suggest that not all PN types may be responsive to selumetinib and that a certain&#xD;
           selumetinib tissue concentration may be required for target inhibition and anti-tumor&#xD;
           activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Determine the objective response rate (PN volume decrease greater than or equal to 20%&#xD;
      compared to baseline) to selumetinib in adult patients with inoperable PN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must be at least 18 years of age with a diagnosis of NF1, with an inoperable,&#xD;
           measureable PN that causes morbidity or is growing, which is amenable to percutaneous&#xD;
           biopsy, and must be willing to undergo two biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 10 patients who meet all criteria, but have PN, which cannot be biopsied safely,&#xD;
           will be eligible for the treatment portion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have adequate organ function, be able to undergo serial MRI scans and have&#xD;
           recovered from acute toxicity of all prior treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a single site open label phase II study in which all subjects will receive&#xD;
           selumetinib orally approximately every 12 hours until patient develops progression of&#xD;
           disease, unacceptable toxicity or, in patients with non-progressive, symptomatic PN at&#xD;
           enrollment, a maximum of 2 years (unless they experience a partial response, or an&#xD;
           improvement in symptoms or function in which case they may continue until progression of&#xD;
           disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Selumetinib will be administered at a dose of 50 mg BID on a continuous dosing schedule&#xD;
           (1 cycle=28 days), which is the recommended adult dose. A maximum accrual of 35&#xD;
           evaluable patients to meet the primary objective; while a maximum of 60 patients in&#xD;
           total may be enrolled to allow for a small number of screen failures, inevaluable&#xD;
           patients and up to 10 patients who cannot safely undergo two biopsies of PNs. Enrollment&#xD;
           will proceed over approximately 24 months.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have positive genetic testing for NF1in a CLIA certified laboratory or a&#xD;
             diagnosis of NF1 based on clinical NIH consensus criteria51 of at least one other&#xD;
             diagnostic criterion in addition to the presence of a PN. NF1 mutation analysis will&#xD;
             be performed on germline DNA as described by Messiaen &amp; Wimmer 52. Histologic&#xD;
             confirmation of tumor is not necessary in the presence of consistent clinical and&#xD;
             imaging findings, but should be considered if malignant transformation of a PN is&#xD;
             clinically suspected. Additional criteria are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Six or more cafe-au-lait macules (greater than or equal to 0.5cm in prepubertal&#xD;
                  subjects or greater than or equal to1.5 cm in post pubertal subjects)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Freckling in axilla or groin&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Optic glioma&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Two or more Lisch nodules&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A distinctive bony lesion (dysplasia of the sphenoid bone or dysplasia or&#xD;
                  thinning of long bone cortex)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A first-degree relative with NF1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease: Patients must have at least one measurable PN, defined as a lesion&#xD;
             of at least 3 cm measured in one dimension. Patients who underwent surgery for&#xD;
             resection of a PN are eligible provided the PN was incompletely resected and is&#xD;
             measurable as per criteria above. Measurability and suitability for volumetric MRI&#xD;
             analysis of the target PN must be confirmed with the NCI POB prior to enrolling a&#xD;
             patient. The target PN will be defined as the clinically most relevant PN, which has&#xD;
             to be amenable to volumetric MRI analysis. PN will be classified as typical PN versus&#xD;
             nodular PN versus solitary nodular PN prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The PN must be inoperable, defined as a PN that cannot be surgically completely&#xD;
             removed without risk for substantial morbidity due to: encasement of or close&#xD;
             proximity to vital structures, invasiveness, or high vascularity of the PN. The PN&#xD;
             either causes morbidity or it is growing and has the potential to cause morbidity such&#xD;
             as (but not limited to): Head and neck lesions that could compromise the airway or&#xD;
             great vessels, paraspinal lesions that can cause myelopathy, brachial or lumbar plexus&#xD;
             lesions that could cause nerve compression and loss of function, lesions that could&#xD;
             result in major deformity (e.g., orbital lesions) or are significantly disfiguring,&#xD;
             and lesions of the extremity that cause limb hypertrophy or loss of function or pain.&#xD;
             PN growth will be defined as a greater than or equal to 20% increase in PN volume&#xD;
             within approximately 3 years prior to enrollment on this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a PN amenable to a percutaneous biopsy to participate in the biopsy&#xD;
             portion of this study, and must be willing to undergo pre-, and on treatment tumor&#xD;
             biopsies. There should be no contraindication for serial biopsies. NOTE: Up to 10&#xD;
             patients who meet all criteria, but have PN which cannot be biopsied safely, will be&#xD;
             eligible for the treatment portion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be able to undergo serial MRI scans for response evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2 (Patients who are wheelchair bound&#xD;
             because of paralysis secondary to a plexiform neurofibroma should be considered&#xD;
             ambulatory when they are up in their wheelchair. Similarly, patients with limited&#xD;
             mobility secondary to need for mechanical support (such as an airway PN requiring&#xD;
             tracheostomy or CPAP) will also be considered ambulatory for the purpose of the&#xD;
             study.)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Prior therapy: Patients with NF1 will only be eligible if complete tumor resection is&#xD;
             not considered to be feasible without substantial risk or morbidity, or if a patient&#xD;
             with a surgical option refuses surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Since there is no standard effective chemotherapy for patients with NF1 and PN,&#xD;
                  patients may be treated on this trial without having received prior medical&#xD;
                  therapy directed at their PN.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Since selumetinib is not expected to cause substantial myelosuppression, there&#xD;

                  study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At least 6 weeks must have elapsed prior to enrollment since the patient received&#xD;
                  any prior radiation therapy, and no prior radiation therapy should have been&#xD;
                  directed at the target PN.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At least 4 weeks must have elapsed since receiving medical therapy directed at&#xD;
                  the PN.&#xD;

          -  Informed Consent: Diagnostic or laboratory studies performed exclusively to determine&#xD;
             eligibility for this trial must only be done after obtaining written informed consent&#xD;
             from all patients, which can be accomplished using the screening consent for this&#xD;
             protocol. Studies or procedures that were performed for clinical indications (not&#xD;
             exclusively to determine eligibility) may be used for screening or baseline values&#xD;
             even if the studies were done before informed consent was obtained, if the patient&#xD;
             agrees.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents, or have received an&#xD;
             investigational agent within the past 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  May not have a NF1 related tumor such as optic pathway glioma or malignant peripheral&#xD;
             nerve sheath tumor, which requires treatment with chemotherapy or surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, active bleeding diatheses or renal transplant, including any patient known&#xD;
             to have hepatitis B, hepatitis C or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
             Patients with HIV who have adequate CD4 counts and who have no requirement for&#xD;
             antiviral therapy will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding females are excluded due to potential risks of fetal and&#xD;
             teratogenic adverse events of an investigational agent. Males or females of&#xD;
             reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use an effective&#xD;
             contraceptive method. Abstinence is an acceptable method of birth control.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with selumetinib or another specific MEK 1/2 inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Supplementation with vitamin E greater than 100% of the daily recommended dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to swallow capsules, since capsules cannot be crushed or broken.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to undergo MRI and/or contraindication for MRI examinations following the&#xD;
             MRI protocol. Prosthesis or orthopedic or dental braces that would interfere with&#xD;
             volumetric analysis of target PN on MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases (e.g., inflammatory&#xD;
             bowel disease), or significant bowel resection that would preclude adequate&#xD;
             absorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (despite medical therapy); blood pressure should be &lt;140/90&#xD;
             in accordance with American Heart Association definition of hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  While not an exclusion criterion, unless clinically indicated, patients should avoid&#xD;
             taking other additional non-study medications that may interfere with the study&#xD;
             medications. In particular, patients should avoid medications that are known to either&#xD;
             induce or inhibit the activity of hepatic microsomal isoenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and&#xD;
             CYP3A4, as this may interfere with the metabolism of selumetinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known Cardiac Disorder, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Known inherited coronary disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Symptomatic heart failure (NYHA Class II-IV prior or current cardiomyopathy, or&#xD;
                  severe valvular heart disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Current cardiomyopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Severe valvular heart disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Atrial fibrillation&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Ejection fraction (ECHO) &lt;53%&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  QTcF &gt;450 msec&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known Ophthalmologic conditions, such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Current or past history of central serous retinopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Current or past history of retinal vein occlusion&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Known intraocular pressure (IOP) &gt; 21 mmHg (or ULN adjusted by age) or&#xD;
                  uncontrolled glaucoma (irrespective of IOP). Patients with known glaucoma and&#xD;
                  increased IOP who do not have meaningful vision (light perception only or no&#xD;
                  light perception) and are not experiencing pain related to the glaucoma, may be&#xD;
                  eligible after discussion with the study chair.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with any other significant abnormality on ophthalmic should be discussed&#xD;
                  with the Study Chair for potential eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Ophthalmological findings secondary to long-standing optic pathway glioma (such&#xD;
                  as visual loss, optic nerve pallor or strabismus) or long-standing&#xD;
                  orbito-temporal PN (such as visual loss, strabismus) will NOT be considered a&#xD;
                  significant abnormality for the purposes of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known severe hypersensitivity to selumetinib or any excipient of selumetinib or&#xD;
             history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to selumetinib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have had recent major surgery within a minimum of 4 weeks prior to starting study&#xD;
             treatment, with the exception of surgical placement for vascular access.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have any unresolved chronic toxicity with CTC AE grade greater than or equal to 2,&#xD;
             from previous anti-NF1 therapy, except for alopecia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical judgment by the investigator that the patient should not participate in the&#xD;
             study&#xD;
