      The purpose of this study is to determine the differences that exist in RNA molecules, the&#xD;
      biochemical process of methylation, and estrogen receptor binding in patients that have&#xD;
      failed to produce adequate endometrium in synthetic embryo transfer cycles when compared to&#xD;
      patients whose endometrium thickness is within normal limits.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the differences that may exist in RNA molecules,&#xD;
      the biochemical process of methylation, and estrogen receptor binding (this is a group of&#xD;
      proteins in the cell that are activated by the hormone estrogen) in patients that have failed&#xD;
      to produce adequate endometrium (uterine lining) in synthetic embryo transfer cycles when&#xD;
      compared to patients whose endometrium thickness is within normal limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appropriate embryo development and luteal phase (when fertilization and implantation occur)&#xD;
      transformation of the endometrium create a small window of opportunity where successful&#xD;
      implantation can occur. The interaction between the embryo and the endometrium is complex and&#xD;
      poorly understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endometrium, which consists of two layers called the functionalis and basalis, goes&#xD;
      through changes during the menstrual cycle. The changes that occur are needed for successful&#xD;
      implantation of an embryo. The proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle is primarily&#xD;
      governed by estrogen and is responsible for the thickening of the endometrium. Progesterone&#xD;
      primarily controls the last half of the menstrual cycle and causes changes which allows for&#xD;
      embryo implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through in vitro fertilization (IVF), the investigators have seen that the correct thickness&#xD;
      of endometrium is a marker of successful implantation and ongoing pregnancy, although the&#xD;
      reason for this is not entirely clear. In order to better understand the processes that may&#xD;
      occur in the endometrium, the investigators are conducting a study which evaluates&#xD;
      biochemical markers of those patients who have shown a failure to proliferate during previous&#xD;
      synthetic IVF frozen cycles and biochemical markers of control patients who have no known&#xD;
      endometrial pathology.&#xD;

        Patients who have undergone a synthetic endometrial proliferation cycle in preparation for&#xD;
        an embryo transfer that were identified as having a proliferative phase defect will serve&#xD;
        as the subjects. Normal, healthy patients who are undergoing infertility treatment for&#xD;
        single gene disorder, family balancing, or male factor infertility will serve as controls.&#xD;
        The study will occur as part of a cryosynthetic preparatory cycle prior to embryo transfer.&#xD;
        There will be 10 cases and 10 controls recruited for participation in the study.&#xD;
