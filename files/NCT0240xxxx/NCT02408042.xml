  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient at least 18 years old and has definitive histologically or cytologically&#xD;
             confirmed: classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) or diffuse large B-Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)&#xD;
             non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient has one or more metastatic lesions &gt;1.5 cm as defined by lymphoma response&#xD;
             criteria by PET-CT scan. If CT scan is needed for clarification of findings on PET-CT&#xD;
             it may be done additionally. Tumor sites that are considered measureable must not have&#xD;
             received prior radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients can be enrolled only on one of the treatment arms on this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The investigator will select the appropriate treatment arm for the patient with the&#xD;
             following requirements: (a) Patients cannot have had prior progression or intolerance&#xD;
             on the single agent chemotherapy and then enrolled on an arm with that same single&#xD;
             agent chemotherapy plus pembro (b) The chemotherapy on the arm selected must be&#xD;
             considered standard of care or listed in www.nccn.org for that cancer type.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have recovered from acute toxicities of prior treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  &gt; 3 weeks must have elapsed since receiving any investigational agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  &gt; 2 weeks must have elapsed since receiving any radiotherapy, or ≥ 3 weeks or 5&#xD;
                  half-lives whichever is shorter for treatment with cytotoxic or biologic agents (&#xD;
                  ≥ 6 weeks for mitomycin or nitrosoureas). Chronic treatment with&#xD;
                  non-investigational gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs or other hormonal or&#xD;
                  supportive care is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient has adequate biological parameters as demonstrated by the following blood&#xD;
             counts at time of screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1000/ microliter, platelet count ≥ 75,000/&#xD;
             microliter, hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL. Subject can be given packed red blood cell&#xD;
             transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 50 ml/min by Cockroft-Gault equation, total&#xD;
             bilirubin 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) range, AST/ALT ≤ 3 times the upper&#xD;
             limit of normal (ULN) range.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) within institutional normal limits. If TSH is above&#xD;
             the upper limit of normal range, then a free T4 within institutional normal limits is&#xD;
             acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. At least 100 days must have elapsed in subjects that had a prior autologous&#xD;
             transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Resolution of prior systemic therapy non-hematologic AE to grade ≤ 2 (except alopecia&#xD;
             or correctable electrolyte abnormality with supplementation)&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patient has a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) ≥ 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Women of child-bearing potential (i.e., women who are pre-menopausal or not surgically&#xD;
             sterile) must be willing to use an acceptable contraceptive method (abstinence, oral&#xD;
             contraceptive or double barrier method) for the duration of the study and for 4 months&#xD;
             following the last dose of Pembrolizumab, brentuximab vedotin, or for 2 years&#xD;
             following the last dose of chemotherapy on this trial, and must have a negative urine&#xD;
             or serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to beginning treatment on this trial. If&#xD;
             a female subject or female partner of a male subject becomes pregnant during this&#xD;
             period then patient will be recommended to seek appropriate obstetric care. The study&#xD;
             will not be monitoring subjects or female partners of subjects for pregnancy after the&#xD;
             last dose of study drug or chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Requiring daily corticosteroid dose ≥ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patient has undergone major surgery, other than diagnostic surgery (e.g., surgery done&#xD;
             to obtain a biopsy for diagnosis without removal of an organ), within 4 weeks prior to&#xD;

&#xD;
         12. Patient will be receiving any other anti-cancer therapy during participation in this&#xD;
             trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Prior treatment with Pembrolizumab is not allowed. Prior receipt of other PD-1&#xD;
             inhibitors or PD-L1 inhibitors is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Active or prior documented autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the&#xD;
