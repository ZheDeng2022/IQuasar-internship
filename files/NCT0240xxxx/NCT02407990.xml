    <time_frame>Day -28 through 5 years and 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE could have been any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of an investigational product. All AEs were monitored per the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE version [v] 4.03 2010).</description>

    <measure>Phase 1A: Number Of Participants With Abnormal Physical Examination Values</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and Day 15 of each cycle through 30 (+/- 7) days after last dose (up to 5 years and 2 months)</time_frame>
    <description>A complete physical examination, vital signs (systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), pulse rate, temperature, and respiratory rate), and weight were performed pre-specified time points for Phase 1A. During the treatment period, symptom-directed physical examinations were performed. If there were no complaints and no abnormal findings from the previous visit for a particular organ system, a physical examination of that organ system was not required.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase 1A: Number Of Participants Experiencing Severe AEs</measure>
    <time_frame>Day -28 through 5 years and 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>All AEs were monitored per the NCI-CTCAE (v 4.03 2010). In addition to performing the CTCAE assessment, the intensity of each AE and serious adverse event (SAE) recorded was assigned to one of the following categories based on the Investigator's clinical judgment: Mild: an event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities; moderate: An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities; severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. Severity was a category utilized for rating the intensity of an event and, accordingly, both AEs and SAEs could be assessed as severe.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This study was conducted in 27 centers in 5 countries, enrolled from June 2015 to October 2017 across both Phases, and was initiated in June 2015. After a 5-year period the sponsor decided to close the study as primary and secondary endpoints were met. Participants still on treatment were rolled into a separate long-term extension study (BGB-A317-290-LTE1) to continue treatment.</recruitment_details>

        <title>Phase 1A: Number of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events (AEs)</title>
        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE could have been any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of an investigational product. All AEs were monitored per the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE version [v] 4.03 2010).</description>

Each treatment cycle was 28 days in duration. In Part 2, participants received selected dosing based on Part 1 at Q2W and/or Q3W until death, disease progression, unacceptable toxicities, or withdrawal of consent. Each treatment cycle was 28 days and 21 days in duration, respectively. In Part 3: participants received a fixed dose that did not exceed the selected maximum tolerated dose (MTD), which was 200 mg Q3W until death, disease progression, unacceptable toxicities, or withdrawal of consent. Each treatment cycle was 21 days in duration.</description>

        <title>Phase 1A: Number Of Participants Experiencing Severe AEs</title>
        <description>All AEs were monitored per the NCI-CTCAE (v 4.03 2010). In addition to performing the CTCAE assessment, the intensity of each AE and serious adverse event (SAE) recorded was assigned to one of the following categories based on the Investigator's clinical judgment: Mild: an event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities; moderate: An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities; severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. Severity was a category utilized for rating the intensity of an event and, accordingly, both AEs and SAEs could be assessed as severe.</description>
        <time_frame>Day -28 through 5 years and 2 months</time_frame>
        <population>Safety Analysis Set (SAF) included all participants who had received any dose of tislelizumab. The analysis was pre-specified to be a pooled analysis of all Part 1A cohort participants (irrespective of dose); therefore, data by individual dose were not analyzed.</population>

Each treatment cycle was 28 days in duration. In Part 2, participants received selected dosing based on Part 1 at Q2W and/or Q3W until death, disease progression, unacceptable toxicities, or withdrawal of consent. Each treatment cycle was 28 days and 21 days in duration, respectively. In Part 3: participants received a fixed dose that did not exceed the selected MTD, which was 200 mg Q3W until death, disease progression, unacceptable toxicities, or withdrawal of consent. Each treatment cycle was 21 days in duration.</description>

          <title>Phase 1B: Number of Participants Experiencing AEs</title>
          <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE could have been any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of an investigational product. All AEs were monitored per the NCI-CTCAE (v 4.03 2010).</description>

        <description>All AEs were monitored per the NCI-CTCAE (v 4.03 2010). In addition to performing the CTCAE assessment, the intensity of each AE and SAE recorded was assigned to one of the following categories based on the Investigator's clinical judgment: Mild: an event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities; moderate: An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities; severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. Severity was a category utilized for rating the intensity of an event and, accordingly, both AEs and SAEs could be assessed as severe.</description>
