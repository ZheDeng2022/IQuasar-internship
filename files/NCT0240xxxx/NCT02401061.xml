  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre-clinical and clinical evaluations show that PRTX- 100 has biological activity that may&#xD;
      lead to improved platelet levels where these are decreased due to immunological pathologies&#xD;
      and that PRTX-100 has an acceptable safety profile. In vivo treatment with PRTX-100 has been&#xD;
      shown to raise platelet counts in a mouse model of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). The primary&#xD;
      objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of PRTX-100 in terms of platelet response in&#xD;
      patients with chronic/persistent ITP.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will be assigned to consecutive PRTX-100 interventions as they are enrolled into the study. Between two and six patients will be enrolled per intervention level. Intervention levels range from one (1) to twenty four (24) micrograms of PRTX-100 per kilogram of patient weight. Patients may receive up to four weekly infusions of PRTX-100 over the study treatment period. PRTX-100 doses ≤ 500 μg will be infused intravenously over 30 minutes. PRTX-100 doses &gt; 500 μg will be infused over 60 minutes. Patients will remain under observation for 4 hours after completion of PRTX-100 dosing for safety management.</description>
