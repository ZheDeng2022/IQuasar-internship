  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of oral azilsartan once daily for 32&#xD;
      weeks on coronary artery plaque in essential hypertensive patients with stable angina and&#xD;
      dyslipidemia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The open-label design without a control group was selected because this clinical study&#xD;
      primarily aims to explore the effects of azilsartan on coronary artery plaques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study targeting patients with coronary artery plaque has been designed to enroll&#xD;
      hypertensive patients with dyslipidemia. Also in light of the invasive nature of the major&#xD;
      assessment procedures (i.e., IB-IVUS, OCT), this study will only enroll patients with stable&#xD;
      angina planned to undergo percutaneous coronary intervention with stent placement, among&#xD;
      patients with coronary artery plaque.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The starting dose of azilsartan has been set to 20 mg on the basis of the usual clinical dose&#xD;
      of the drug in patients with essential hypertension, and dose increase of azilsartan will be&#xD;
      permitted only when the target blood pressure has not been achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of treatment has been set to 32 weeks in line with clinical practice, in which&#xD;
      coronary angiography is typically performed after a 32-week follow-up period following PCI&#xD;
      with stent placement.&#xD;
