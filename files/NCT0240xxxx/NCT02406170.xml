  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced oesophagogastric cancer (OCG) have a very poor prognosis. After&#xD;
      progression on first line therapy, second line chemotherapy with paclitaxel and a VEGF-R2&#xD;
      targeting antibody has a proven benefit on survival. However, no data are available on the&#xD;
      combination of paclitaxel with kinase inhibitors in advanced OGC. Here the investigators&#xD;
      propose a Phase 1b study to assess the tolerability of regorafenib (an oral multi kinase&#xD;
      inhibitor) in combination with paclitaxel and to assess the uptake of paclitaxel in OCG&#xD;
      metastasis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regorafenib is a new oral multikinase inhibitor of angiogenic, stromal and oncogenic receptor&#xD;
      tyrosine kinases. Regorafenib demonstrated to increase the overall survival of patients with&#xD;
      metastatic colorectal cancer and has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA), as well as by The European Medicines Agency (EMA). In a recent phase IB study the&#xD;
      combination of regorafenib with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI was shown to be a tolerable treatment&#xD;
      regimen as first- or second-line treatment of colorectal cancer. Unfortunately, no data are&#xD;
      available showing the effect of regorafenib on chemotherapy uptake in metastases. Here the&#xD;
      investigators propose a phase IB study in advanced OGC with cytotoxic treatment consisting of&#xD;
      paclitaxel together with regorafenib, to assess the tolerability of the combination as second&#xD;
      line therapy for metastasized OGC and to assess the effect of regorafenib on paclitaxel&#xD;
      uptake in OGC metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the tolerability of regorafenib combined with paclitaxel. Secondary objectives To&#xD;
      assess the effect of regorafenib on uptake of paclitaxel in OGC metastases. To assess the&#xD;
      effect of regorafenib on regorafenib targets in OGC metastases and blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the effect of regorafenib on paclitaxel pharmacokinetics. To obtain exploratory&#xD;
      data on the efficacy of the combination of regorafenib with paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A phase 1b study of tolerability of regorafenib in combination with paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with advanced oesophagogastric cancer, fit for second line treatment systemic&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will perform a phase 1b dose finding study (phase I) and then expand the&#xD;
      cohort for evaluating the uptake of paclitaxel in OCG metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paclitaxel will be tested as cytotoxic backbone for combination with regorafenib in advanced&#xD;
      OGC. Paclitaxel will be dosed 80 mg/m2 I.V. infusion on Days 1, 8, and 15 of every 28 day&#xD;
      cycle as has been reported previously and has been used in the recent RAINBOW study&#xD;
      (NCT01170663).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive regorafenib daily from day 1-21 of a 28-day cycle. The first cycle&#xD;
      starting on day 2 after the first administration of chemotherapy for pharmacodynamics/kinetic&#xD;
      purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the second cycle onwards, regorafenib will be dosed from day 1-21. Four different dose&#xD;
      levels will be assessed. After the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been defined, the&#xD;
      corresponding patient cohort will be expanded to 33 patients to assess the effect of&#xD;
      regorafenib on uptake of paclitaxel in OGC metastases on day 1 and 15 of the first cycle&#xD;
      (phase II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for the starting dose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paclitaxel will be dosed 80 mg/m2 I.V. infusion on Days 1, 8, and 15 of every 28 day cycle as&#xD;
      has been reported previously and has been used in the recent RAINBOW study The first dose of&#xD;
      Regorafenib in the escalation scheme is 80mg per os qd. In phase 1 studies the optimum dose&#xD;
      for regorafenib monotherapy has been set at 160mg per os q.d. However, considering the&#xD;
      potential side effects of paclitaxel in combination with regorafenib the investigators chose&#xD;
      a starting dose of 80mg per os qd.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose level Paclitaxel dose Regorafenib dose Minimum number patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      -1 80mg/m3 i.v 40 mg p.o. qd&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. (starting) 80mg/m3 i.v 80 mg p.o. qd 3&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 80mg/m3 i.v 120 mg p.o. qd 3&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 80mg/m3 i.v 160 mg p.o. qd 3&#xD;
