    <textblock>
      Purpose: Home monitoring (HM) services supplied by different manufacturers (St Jude Medical,&#xD;
      Biotronik, Medtronic) enables trained medical staff (doctors, electrophysiology nurses and&#xD;
      technicians) to safely follow-up patients with implanted ICD/CRT-D remotely, with omitting&#xD;
      unnecessary visits in outpatient clinic, shortening time to medical intervention and&#xD;
      therefore help to decrease hospitalization rate among those patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RESULT study primary endpoint of the trial will be a composite of all-cause death or&#xD;
      hospitalization due to cardiovascular reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary technical endpoint is to construct and evaluate a unified and integrated platform&#xD;
      for data collected from RM devices manufactured by different companies: Carelink™&#xD;
      (Medtronic®, Minneapolis, MN, USA), Merlin™ (Saint Jude Medical®, St. Paul, MN, USA) and Home&#xD;
      Monitoring™ (Biotronik®, Berlin, Germany).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The RESULT trial is a prospective, single-center, randomized, open label, parallel study. All&#xD;
      consecutive patients with symptomatic HF and reduced ejection fraction (≤ 35%) with ICDs or&#xD;
      CRT-Ds implanted accordingly to current ESC practice guidelines will be prospectively&#xD;
      randomized in a 1:1 fashion to either a traditional or an RM-based follow-up model. Six&#xD;
      hundred patients will be enrolled. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are shown in Table 1.&#xD;
      The clinical status of patients will be estimated using the composite endpoint of all-cause&#xD;
      death and hospitalization due to cardiovascular reasons. The study protocol has been approved&#xD;
      by a local ethics committee and complies with the Declaration of Helsinki. A written informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained from all study participants. Primary endpoint The primary endpoint&#xD;
      of the trial will be a composite of all-cause death or hospitalization due to cardiovascular&#xD;
      reasons. Hospitalization for cardiovascular reasons should consist of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospitalization due to progression of heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospitalization due to persistent arrhythmia (AF, VT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospitalization due to embolic episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospitalization due to acute coronary syndrome. Every patient will be followed for at&#xD;
           least 12 months after randomization. Assessment of hospitalization events for&#xD;
           cardiovascular reasons will be performed according to a recently published consensus&#xD;
           [13]. The final classification of hospital admissions due to cardiovascular reasons will&#xD;
           be made by a blinded endpoints committee. The primary technical endpoint is to construct&#xD;
           and evaluate a unified and integrated platform for data collected from RM devices&#xD;
           manufactured by different companies: Carelink™ (Medtronic®, Minneapolis, MN, USA),&#xD;
           Merlin™ (Saint Jude Medical®, St. Paul, MN, USA) and Home Monitoring™ (Biotronik®,&#xD;
           Berlin, Germany). Secondary endpoints Both elements combined in the primary endpoint&#xD;
           will be analyzed separately to estimate their relative impact on the primary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All-cause death.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospitalization due to cardiovascular reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to medical intervention in case of relevant incidents (arrhythmic, device&#xD;
           malfunction, signs of HF decompensation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Average number of visits to an outpatient clinic (scheduled and unscheduled) per&#xD;
           patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to first unscheduled visit in an outpatient clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of inappropriate ICD shocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of visits to outpatient clinics with relevant findings (necessity of changes&#xD;
           of device programming or pharmacological therapy, rehospitalization, interventions,&#xD;
           invasive procedures).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of quality of life of living study participants according to the Minnesota&#xD;
           Quality of Life Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cost-effectiveness, defined as the cost of hospitalizations and/or scheduled and&#xD;
           unscheduled visits in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All consecutive patients after implantation of an ICD or CRT-D manufactured by St.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Jude Medical, Biotronik or Medtronic will undergo an initial evaluation. Patients who have&#xD;
      given informed consent and who fulfill the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be screened.&#xD;
      Randomization to the RM or control group will be conducted within 30 days after ICD or CRT-D&#xD;
      implantation and after the final programming of sensing and stimulation parameters. The time&#xD;
      of observation in both groups will be 12 months after randomization. In the RM group only,&#xD;
      one follow-up visit will be planned 12 months after being enrolled in the trial. In the&#xD;
      control group, follow-up visits will be planned at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after being enrolled&#xD;
      in the trial, according to the normal procedure in our center. Unscheduled visits in both&#xD;
      groups can be initiated either by the patient or by the supervising staff. The limits of&#xD;
      therapeutic intervention will be individualized depending on the clinical situation according&#xD;
      to valid ESC guidelines and will include the following: modification of device settings,&#xD;
      modification of pharmacotherapy and performing necessary invasive diagnostic and therapeutic&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
