      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of nivolumab when given with&#xD;
      ipilimumab in treating patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) associated classical&#xD;
      Hodgkin lymphoma that has returned after a period of improvement or does not respond to&#xD;
      treatment, or solid tumors that have spread to other places in the body or cannot be removed&#xD;
      by surgery. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab and nivolumab, may&#xD;
      help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor&#xD;
      cells to grow and spread. Ipilimumab is an antibody that acts against a molecule called&#xD;
      cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4). CTLA-4 controls a part of your immune system by&#xD;
      shutting it down. Nivolumab is a type of antibody that is specific for human programmed cell&#xD;
      death 1 (PD-1), a protein that is responsible for destruction of immune cells. Giving&#xD;
      ipilimumab with nivolumab may work better in treating patients with HIV associated classical&#xD;
      Hodgkin lymphoma or solid tumors compared to ipilimumab with nivolumab alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To demonstrate safety and feasibility of ipilimumab and nivolumab at the standard doses of&#xD;
      drug in solid tumor and relapsed refractory HIV-classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) participants&#xD;
      with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection given the possibility of increased toxicity&#xD;
      based on immune activation, co-morbidity, or interference with highly active antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy (HAART) therapy. (Dose De-escalation and Dose Expansion Cohorts)&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the effects of single agent nivolumab, and the combination of ipilimumab and&#xD;
      nivolumab, on immune function (HIV viral load in plasma using conventional assay, CD4+ and&#xD;
      CD8+ cells). (Dose De-escalation Cohort) II. To preliminarily assess objective response rates&#xD;
      associated with treatment for commonly represented solid tumors (Kaposi sarcoma, anal cancer,&#xD;
      and lung cancer) and relapsed refractory HIV-cHL. (Solid Tumor Dose Expansion and cHL&#xD;
      Cohorts) III. To evaluate the effects of single agent nivolumab, and the combination of&#xD;

      and nivolumab on HIV reactive T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Patients in dose&#xD;
      level 2 also receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1 of every third cycle of&#xD;
      nivolumab, and patients in dose level -2 also receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1&#xD;
      of every sixth cycle of nivolumab. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 46 cycles of&#xD;
      nivolumab (with ipilimumab if receiving dose level 2 or -2) in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 16 weeks or 112 days (based&#xD;
      on 5 half lives).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The effects of nivolumab and ipilimumab on the developing human fetus are unknown; for&#xD;
             this reason and because other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be&#xD;
             teratogenic, women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and men must agree to use&#xD;
             adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior&#xD;
             to study entry and for the duration of study participation; WOCBP should use an&#xD;

             drug; women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy&#xD;
             test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropic&#xD;
             [HCG]) within 72 hours prior enrollment and the start of nivolumab; women must not be&#xD;
             breastfeeding; men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive&#xD;
             method with a failure rate of less than 1% per year; men receiving nivolumab and who&#xD;
             are sexually active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a&#xD;
             period of 31 weeks after the last dose of investigational product; women who are not&#xD;
             of childbearing potential (i.e., who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile as well&#xD;
             as azoospermic men) do not require contraception; WOCBP receiving nivolumab will be&#xD;
             instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 6 months after the last dose of&#xD;
             investigational product; men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually active with&#xD;
             WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 31 weeks after the&#xD;
             last dose of investigational product; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she (or the&#xD;
             participating partner) should inform the treating physician immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants MUST receive appropriate care and treatment for HIV infection, including&#xD;
             antiretroviral medications when clinically indicated, and should be under the care of&#xD;
             a physician experienced in HIV management; participants will be eligible regardless of&#xD;
             antiretroviral medication (including no antiretroviral medication) provided there is&#xD;
             no intention to initiate therapy or the regimen has been stable for at least 4 weeks&#xD;

             antigen [HBsAg] positive and anti-hepatitis B core [HBc]-total positive), may be&#xD;
             enrolled, provided total bilirubin is =&lt; 1.5 x institutional ULN, and AST (SGOT) and&#xD;
             ALT (SGPT) must be =&lt; 3 X institutional upper limit of normal, and hepatitis B virus&#xD;
             (HBV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) &lt; 100 IU/mL (if hepatitis B positive) within 2 weeks&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Criteria for Solid Tumor Expansion and Lymphoma Cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Inclusion and exclusion criteria for this cohort are the same as above, with the&#xD;
                  following rule for CD4 count based on tolerability in Phase I; if, participants&#xD;
                  with lymphocyte T CD4 count between 100-200/mm^3 (Stratum 2) are shown to&#xD;
                  tolerate treatment in the Phase I dose de-escalation portion at the same dose&#xD;
                  level as those with CD4 counts &gt; 200/mm^3 (Stratum 1), participants in the&#xD;
                  expansion cohort with CD4 counts &gt;= 100/mm^3 are permitted; otherwise, the&#xD;
                  expansion is open to all solid tumor patients except those whose tumors are known&#xD;
                  not to respond to nivolumab (pancreas, prostate and MSS colon cancer); for the&#xD;
                  relapsed refractory HIV-cHL cohort, participants with CD4 count &gt;= 100/mm^3 are&#xD;
                  permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have received any other investigational agents within the 4 weeks&#xD;
             prior to enrollment; concurrent radiation therapy is not permitted, except palliative&#xD;
             (limited-field) radiation therapy, if all of the following criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Repeat imaging demonstrates no new sites of bone metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The lesion being considered for palliative radiation is not a target lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases must be excluded&#xD;
             unless they qualify for enrollment as described below because of poor prognosis and&#xD;
             concerns regarding progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the&#xD;
             evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events; participants with brain metastases&#xD;
             are permitted if metastases have been treated and there is no magnetic resonance&#xD;
             imaging (MRI) evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks or more after treatment is&#xD;
             complete and within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of nivolumab administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to ipilimumab, nivolumab, or other agents used in study, or history of&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment&#xD;
             with either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other&#xD;
             immunosuppressive medications within 2 weeks of study drug administration; these drugs&#xD;
             may interfere with the activity of ipilimumab and nivolumab if administered at the&#xD;
             time of the first ipilimumab dose; inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement&#xD;
             doses =&lt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active&#xD;
             autoimmune disease; participants are permitted to use topical, ocular,&#xD;
             intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalational corticosteroids (with minimal systemic&#xD;
             absorption); physiologic replacement doses of systemic corticosteroids are permitted,&#xD;
             even if &gt;= 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents; a brief course of corticosteroids for&#xD;
             prophylaxis (e.g., contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non-autoimmune conditions&#xD;
             (e.g., delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction caused by contact allergen) is&#xD;
             permitted; use of anabolic steroids is permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with clinical or radiographic evidence of pancreatitis are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants should be excluded if they have had prior treatment with an anti-PD-1,&#xD;
             anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), anti-programmed cell death ligand 2&#xD;
             (PD-L2), anti-CTLA-4 antibody, or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting&#xD;
             T-cell co-stimulation or immune checkpoint pathways; prior immune modulating therapy&#xD;
             including vaccines may be eligible; prior immune events must be evaluated and the risk&#xD;
             for new events which may represent continued sub clinical disease or a new process at&#xD;
             previously damaged site or immune potentiation (e.g. ipilimumab followed by IL2&#xD;
             causing bowel perforation, ipilimumab followed by indolea&#xD;
