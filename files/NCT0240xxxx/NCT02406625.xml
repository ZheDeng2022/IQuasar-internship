  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Suicidal behaviors among adolescents represents a public health problem due to its high&#xD;
      prevalence and its low predictability. It is also known that brain development continues&#xD;
      during adolescence, therefore, a therapeutic intervention during this period might propitiate&#xD;
      neural changes that might favor the emotional regulation involved in suicidal behaviors.&#xD;
      Dialectical Behavioral Therapy has proved to be effective regarding this problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this reason, the investigators aimed to study the clinical, neuropsychological and neural&#xD;
      effects of Dialectical Behavioral Therapy in adolescents with suicidal behaviors.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Suicidal behaviors represent a public health problem due to its high prevalence and its low&#xD;
      predictability. At a neurological level, higher vulnerability for suicidal behavior has been&#xD;
      related to a frontostriatal-cingulum tract dysfunction as well as attention, memory and&#xD;
      executive deficits. It is also known that brain development continues during adolescence,&#xD;
      therefore, a therapeutic intervention during this period might propitiate neural changes that&#xD;
      could favor the emotional regulation involved in suicidal behaviors. Specifically,&#xD;
      Dialectical Behavioral Therapy has proved to be effective regarding this problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesis is that DBT (Dialectical Behavioral Therapy) will improve&#xD;
      clinical symptoms associated with suicidal behaviors, as well as the neural interconnections,&#xD;
      which will result not only in structural and functional connectivity changes, but also in a&#xD;
      better cognitive functioning. The investigators aimed to investigate the clinical,&#xD;
      neuropsychological, and neural effects of Dialectical Behavioral Therapy in adolescents with&#xD;
      suicidal behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators method is a randomized, controlled study that includes 30 patients with&#xD;
      suicidal behaviors and 15 healthy controls between the ages of 12 and 18 years. Patients were&#xD;
      assigned to one of two groups (randomized): DBT and Regular Support Therapy. Clinical and&#xD;
      neuropsychological evaluations were performed before and after the treatment for both patient&#xD;
      groups. Additionally, Structural MRI data sets, diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) and Functional&#xD;
      Connectivity (Resting State fmri) were acquired for all patients and controls at baseline and&#xD;
      after treatment. Initial characteristics will be compared between the three groups, and the&#xD;
      investigators will also compared clinical, neuropsychological and imaging measures before and&#xD;
      after the treatment.&#xD;
