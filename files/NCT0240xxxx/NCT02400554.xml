    <textblock>
      This is an obesity and alcohol, tobacco, and other drug (ATOD) use risk prevention and health&#xD;
      leadership program. This project will include 150 at-risk adult Native women across 5&#xD;
      communities (30 women from each community) in the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma. The&#xD;
      intervention targets individual behavioral change relative to ATOD and obesity prevention and&#xD;
      simultaneously provides behavioral skills for health promotion leadership.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will conduct a longitudinal study using a cluster randomized stepped-wedge&#xD;
      design to evaluate the intervention impact on ATOD and obesity prevention primary aims of:&#xD;
      (1) substance use harm reduction and ATOD use and intentions to use; and (2) reduction in&#xD;
      weight/body mass index (BMI) and increase in leisure-time physical activity/physical activity&#xD;
      (LTPA/PA) and healthful food habits. Specifically, investigators will ask participants to&#xD;
      participate in up to eight group sessions (based on a curriculum drawing on cultural&#xD;
      teachings around health and behavioral change); attend up to three Motivational Interviewing&#xD;
      individual sessions (to identify individual behavioral change goals); attend a two-day&#xD;
      overnight culture and Trail prep camp; participate in camping and walking for up to 10 days&#xD;
      on the Trail; and attend up to six post-walk meetings (to develop community health events).&#xD;
      All five communities will also be asked to complete a baseline health assessment as well as&#xD;
      three follow up assessments over the course of the year. Additionally, communities 2-5 will&#xD;
      participate in three pre-intervention health assessments. This intervention integrates&#xD;
      components of motivational interviewing, information-motivation-behavior, and a leadership&#xD;
      development framework for adults. It targets individual behavioral change relative to ATOD&#xD;
      and obesity prevention and simultaneously provides behavioral skills for health promotion&#xD;
      leadership within their respective communities.The project addresses a critical public health&#xD;
      issue among a group experiencing considerable health disparities and strengthens the research&#xD;
      infrastructure in partnership with the Tribe. If efficacious, it has the potential for&#xD;
      widespread dissemination and could be generalizable to other chronic co-occurring mental&#xD;
      health and physical health conditions.&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will conduct a 5-community longitudinal study using a cluster randomized&#xD;
      stepped-wedge design to evaluate the intervention impact on alcohol, tobacco, and other drug&#xD;
      (ATOD) and obesity prevention primary aims of: (1) substance use harm reduction, overall ATOD&#xD;
      use and intentions to use; and (2) weight/body mass index (BMI) change as well as the effect&#xD;
      on leisure-time physical activity/physical activity (LTPA/PA), and healthful food habits&#xD;
      among adult Choctaw women at risk for obesity and ATOD. The cluster randomized stepped-wedge&#xD;
      design is a type of cross-over study in which clusters of women from each community cross&#xD;
      over to the intervention arm at randomly assigned time points (one time per year, per&#xD;
      community).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequence and Timing of Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Investigators have created five regional communities and within each community&#xD;
      a convenience sample will be drawn. Each site has been randomly assigned to start the&#xD;
      intervention at a given year. Randomization occurs only to determine the year each community&#xD;
      enters the study. Community 1 will begin the intervention immediately; communities 2-5 will&#xD;
      complete three health assessments prior to beginning the intervention. These will occur at&#xD;
      the same time of post-walk assessments for the community currently in the intervention (i.e.&#xD;
      community 2 does health assessments in the same months community 1 does post-walk assessments&#xD;
      and then begins the intervention in Year 2.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and Screening of Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment strategies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Referrals from staff from Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma (CNO) project staff, staff at&#xD;
           Choctaw Nation Health Services Authority (CNHSA), Community Advisory Council members,&#xD;
           health providers, and general community members. They will provide potential&#xD;
           participants with a flyer and encourage women to call if interested.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The following strategies will be used as necessary: posting flyers in community health&#xD;
           clinics, stores, community centers, and other locations identified by our community&#xD;
           advisors; and posting flyers in the tribal newspaper, other local news outlets, and on a&#xD;
           study Facebook page.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recruitment materials will invite American Indian/Alaska Native women who are interested&#xD;
           in participating in the research study to call a dedicated, toll-free phone number or&#xD;
           the project number at Choctaw Nation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants can opt for a phone or in-person screen using the same script.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CNO study staff will answer and return phone calls and conduct the screens. Indigenous&#xD;
           Wellness Research Institute (IWRI) staff will conduct eligibility screens on the phone&#xD;
           as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women screened out will be given a community resource list. Phone screeners will offer&#xD;
           to mail or email the list.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If a person is eligible, but declines to participate, they will be given a brief&#xD;
           one-item exit question regarding general reason for non-participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible women who agree to participate will be asked to schedule their baseline&#xD;
           assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive reminders by email, text or phone 2 days before, the day before,&#xD;
      and the day of any meetings, assessments, or events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent and Baseline Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline assessment consists of a brief physical health assessment and a&#xD;
      computer-assisted behavioral health survey administered by study staff. The physical health&#xD;
      assessment is a non-invasive procedure that involves the measurement of BMI (with portable&#xD;
      digital weight scale and height measure) and blood pressure. The computer-assisted behavioral&#xD;
      health survey will ask a series of questions and take under 90 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After consent is obtained, CNO study staff will set up the study laptop and headphones that&#xD;
      the participant will use to enter their responses to the questionnaire. The variable matrix&#xD;
      includes instructions, prompts, response scales, and references for all measures used for&#xD;
      each behavioral health assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group Sessions/Yappalli Curriculum (Months 1-3) Participants will attend up to eight group&#xD;
      sessions. The curriculum for these sessions includes: learning about Choctaw history,&#xD;
      traditions,and cultural systems as well as women's roles (e.g., Treaty of Dancing Rabbit&#xD;
      Creek); participating in cultural activities (e.g., stickball or social dances); developing&#xD;
      traditionally-based materials (e.g., walking sticks); and using cultural metaphors for&#xD;
      behavioral changes (e.g., 4 pillars of wellness-mind, body, spirit, emotion)). Experiential,&#xD;
      outdoor activities are incorporated to promote group cohesion, improve relational worldviews,&#xD;
      and connectedness to nature and the environment. Examples include activities on an outdoor&#xD;
      ropes course maintained and managed by CNHSA or increasing LTPA/PA by walking or gardening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motivational Interviewing Individual Sessions (Months 1-3) In up to three sessions,&#xD;
      participants will identify personal change goals on the main outcome variables as well as&#xD;
      community leadership goals. These sessions will target four areas: increasing physical&#xD;
      activity or movement; reducing or eliminating &quot;junk&quot; snack foods, sweets, and sugared soft&#xD;
      drinks; decreasing addiction and or potential to misuse tobacco, alcohol or other substances&#xD;
      and food; and increasing community leadership skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Culture Camp (Month 2) In this two-day, overnight camp participants will practice camping and&#xD;
      being outdoors (e.g., setting up tents, trying out new shoes and equipment, etc.) and begin&#xD;
      to strengthen group cohesion prior to embarking on the Trail. It is also designed to&#xD;
      synthesize goals and cultural values discussed in the group and individual sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trail of Tears Walk (Month 3) Participants will gather at a location in Oklahoma before&#xD;
      driving to a starting point at the Mississippi/Arkansas border then follow one of the routes&#xD;
      of the Choctaw Trail of Tears through Arkansas and back into Oklahoma. They will walk on&#xD;
      average 8-10 miles per day and travel by van for a portion of the trail to a different&#xD;
      campsite each day. At the end of the trip, the walkers will have walked approximately 60-80&#xD;
      miles over the 260 mile route. On the last night of the Trail, participants will make a vow&#xD;
      to conduct a community-wide event (based on personal and leadership goals and experience on&#xD;
      the Trail) within nine months. Note: a support van will travel along with walkers so that&#xD;
      they could walk as many minutes or miles they feel comfortable doing (e.g., from 10 mins.&#xD;
      Less than a quarter mile to 10 miles).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Walk assessments (Months 3-12) Three follow-up health assessments will occur: one&#xD;
      immediately post-walk in Month 3, one in Month 9, and one in Month 12. These behavioral&#xD;
      health assessments will be collected in the same manner and include a similar set of measures&#xD;
      as the baseline assessment. The physical health assessments will also be conducted in the&#xD;
      same manner as the baseline assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Walk Group Meetings (Months 3-12) Participants will attend up to six group meetings to&#xD;
      plan community leadership events (investigators provide a small budget for the women to&#xD;
      create a community event such as a community food garden). Specific meetings include: at&#xD;
      three months post-walk a digital storytelling training to create a story related to ATOD and&#xD;
      obesity prevention and their personal experiences; and at six months post-walk an individual&#xD;
      MI booster session to revise their personal vows/goals and community leadership goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final Community Event (Month 12) Participants will share digital stories and/or community&#xD;
      event experiences and undergo a naming ceremony as they transition to health leaders within&#xD;
      their communities. They will be given the option to become a member of one of seven Choctaw&#xD;
      health promotion societies on which the intervention is based to continue their health&#xD;
      promotion leadership efforts after their participation in the project ends.&#xD;
