      The primary objective of this study is to determine the effects of the antiprogestin&#xD;
      ulipristal acetate (UA) on the epithelial and stromal compartments of the normal breast in&#xD;
      women at increased risk of breast cancer (BC) and to relate these effects to quantitative&#xD;
      changes on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The goal is to define predictive&#xD;
      imaging biomarkers for subsequent testing in randomised prevention trials of antiprogestins.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Breast cancer (BC) is the commonest cancer, affecting 1.4 million women per year of whom a&#xD;
      third die from the disease. There is an urgent need for new approaches to BC prevention.&#xD;
      Progesterone is a hormone that is produced naturally from a woman's ovaries during each&#xD;
      menstrual cycle and is often used in hormone replacement therapy (HRT) after the menopause.&#xD;
      When used in HRT progesterone increases the risk of BC and BC death. In experiments in mice&#xD;
      and rats progesterone has been shown to increase the growth of the normal mammary gland (the&#xD;
      rodent breast). When human breast tissue is grown in the laboratory it also grows in response&#xD;
      to progesterone. In particular progesterone has been shown to increase the growth of&#xD;
      particular cells called stem cells which survive for a long time in the breast. It is thought&#xD;
      that the exposure of these stem cells to progesterone over many years is the reason that&#xD;
      women whose periods start early and finish late or those who do not have a pregnancy to&#xD;
      interrupt their menstrual cycles and those that take HRT all have an increased risk of BC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project the investigators will use a drug that blocks the effects of progesterone&#xD;
      called ulipristal acetate (UA, EsmyaTM) that is currently licenced in the treatment of&#xD;
      fibroids of the uterus. When used to treat fibroids UA is very well tolerated with no&#xD;
      increase in side effects compared to a placebo tablet. 30 women at increased risk of BC will&#xD;
      be recruited and have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and mammogram followed by a&#xD;
      biopsy of one breast. After 3 months of UA treatment the MRI will be repeated along with a&#xD;
      biopsy from the other breast. The effects of UA on many different cell types in the biopsies,&#xD;
      including the stem cells and also the tissues like collagen that support them will be&#xD;
      examined in detail. The effects of UA treatment on gene and protein expression in the breast&#xD;
      tissue will also be examined. The goal is to identify which women will be sensitive or&#xD;
      resistant to UA as a BC prevention treatment. In addition changes in the MRI scans with UA&#xD;
      treatment will be examined using several different analysis techniques to try and identify&#xD;
      who will likely benefit from UA treatment in the future without the need for biopsies.&#xD;
