    <textblock>
      Heart disease is a major cause of ill-health and death in adults. The risk factors for heart&#xD;
      disease, if present in children, carry over into adult life. Childhood obesity has reached&#xD;
      epidemic proportions in Canada and is associated with many heart disease risk factors such as&#xD;
      high blood pressure. Another complication of obesity is obstructive sleep apnea. Sleep apnea&#xD;
      is marked by snoring at night, pauses in breathing and low oxygen levels and occurs in up to&#xD;
      60% of obese children, but it is diagnosed in less than 20% of obese children. Importantly,&#xD;
      sleep apnea in children, like obesity, is linked with high blood pressure and heart disease.&#xD;
      Thus, children with sleep apnea who are obese are likely to have an increased risk for high&#xD;
      blood pressure and heart disease. Currently, there is little knowledge of the extent of heart&#xD;
      disease in obese children with sleep apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The best treatment for both obesity and sleep apnea is weight loss. Weight loss strategies&#xD;
      are generally not very successful and since 75% of obese children will become obese adults,&#xD;
      urgent treatments are needed to reduce heart disease in the long-term. Treating sleep apnea&#xD;
      in obese children may be one of the ways to reduce heart disease. Sleep apnea can be treated&#xD;
      with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which involves wearing a mask attached to a&#xD;
      breathing machine while asleep. It is unknown how effective CPAP is in reducing heart disease&#xD;
      in obese children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit children with sleep apnea who are obese and test for heart&#xD;
      disease risk. The investigators will then treat these children with CPAP. After 6 months of&#xD;
      CPAP, the investigators will repeat the tests to determine if CPAP lowers the risk for heart&#xD;
      disease. At the end of the 6 months, those receiving CPAP will be randomized to either&#xD;
      continue CPAP or discontinue CPAP for a 2 week period. At the end of the 2 week period the&#xD;
      participants will repeat the tests again to determine the magnitude of the effect of CPAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect that CPAP treatment for sleep apnea in obese children will reduce&#xD;
      blood pressure and lower heart disease. These results will increase awareness of the dangers&#xD;
      of sleep apnea in obese children, which will facilitate early diagnosis and treatment,&#xD;
      ultimately reducing heart disease long-term.&#xD;

      Statement of the Problem: In Canada, child and adolescent obesity, defined as a body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI) of &gt;95th percentile for age and gender1 represents one of the most common&#xD;
      conditions effecting children in Canada with an obesity rate of 10% in 12-17 year old&#xD;
      children, which currently equates to approximately half a million obese children in Canada.&#xD;
      Obesity is not only complicated by cardiovascular and metabolic dysfunction, such as left&#xD;
      ventricular modeling, hypertension, glucose intolerance and dyslipidaemia, it is also&#xD;
      associated with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), occurring in up to 60% of obese&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OSAS is characterized by snoring, recurrent partial (hypopneas) or complete obstruction&#xD;
      (apneas) of the upper airway, frequently associated with intermittent oxyhaemoglobin&#xD;
      desaturations, sleep disruption and fragmentation. The gold standard test for diagnosing&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea is a polysomnogram (PSG). Specifically, OSAS affects 1-4% of healthy&#xD;
      children who are typically 2-8 years of age6, coinciding with adenotonsillar hypertrophy, the&#xD;
      commonest cause of OSAS in children. Usual treatment for OSAS in children with adenotonsillar&#xD;
      hypertrophy is an adenotonsillectomy (AT). However, there is clear evidence that not only is&#xD;
      there a high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea in obese children, but further, the AT is&#xD;
      not successful for resolution of OSAS. This is, in part due to the fact that adenotonsillar&#xD;
      hypertrophy is not the single most significant risk factor for OSAS in the obese population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The factors implicated in the pathophysiology of OSAS in obese children include soft tissues&#xD;
      restricting the upper airway size such as fat pads in the soft palate, lateral pharyngeal&#xD;
      wall and at the base of the tongue. However, despite the anatomic evidence predisposing obese&#xD;
      children to OSAS there are also alterations in functional mechanisms that lead to increased&#xD;
      airway collapsibility predisposing these children to OSAS. Specifically, obesity is&#xD;
      associated with significant alterations in body composition that could affect chest wall&#xD;
      mechanics by weighting the chest wall and reducing lung compliance. Functional residual&#xD;
      capacity is diminished to abdominal visceral fat impinging on the chest cavity. Such a&#xD;
      reduction in functional residual capacity and compliance increases the risk for sleep&#xD;
      disordered breathing by mechanisms of hypoventilation, atelectasis and ventilation perfusion&#xD;
      mismatch all increasing the work of breathing and fatigue. Moreover, hypoventilation in&#xD;
      itself may reduce upper airway motor tone. Further, ventilator responses may be altered as&#xD;
      studies focusing on obese adults have shown that morbidly obese subjects are more susceptible&#xD;
      to decreased ventilatory responses to both hypoxia and hypercapnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given this understanding that adenotonsillectomy is not curative in obese children with&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea, weight loss would be considered the treatment of choice. However,&#xD;
      obesity intervention programs have not been wholly successful in BMI reduction in children&#xD;
      although in overweight adults, magnitude of weight loss was related to an improvement in&#xD;
      OSAS. Thus, the delivery of positive airway pressure (PAP) either continuous positive airway&#xD;
      pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) is increasingly used as the first&#xD;
      line of treatment for OSAS in obese children, although usually in conjunction with weight&#xD;
      loss strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the benefits of PAP are well established in adults, there is a paucity of available&#xD;
      paediatric data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As previously mentioned, obesity is a risk factor for cardiovascular and metabolic&#xD;
      dysfunction; however, OSAS independent of obesity is further associated with cardiac&#xD;
      remodeling and cardiovascular metabolic dysfunction. Specifically, if untreated, obstructive&#xD;
      sleep apnea in children may lead to excessive daytime sleepiness, poor school performance,&#xD;
      hypertension, changes in left ventricular mass and geometry, endothelial cell dysfunction,&#xD;
      arterial stiffness, autonomic dysfunction inflammation, and the Metabolic Syndrome (MetS).&#xD;
      Thus, OSAS in the context of obesity may independently or synergistically magnify the risk of&#xD;
      an already compromised cardiometabolic regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several metrics will be utilized. Physical activity levels will be measured utilizing&#xD;
      Habitual Activity Questionnaires. Insulin resistance will be measured using Fasting Glucose&#xD;
      and Fasting Insulin Levels. Cardiovascular markers will include 24 hour blood pressure and&#xD;
      cardiograms - left ventricular mass index. C Reactive Protein (CRP) will be utilized as the&#xD;
      marker of inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanisms linking both OSAS and obesity to cardiometabolic dysfunction is believed to be&#xD;
      due to activity of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and effects of oxidative stress,&#xD;
      exacerbating proinflammatory states. Chronic, awake sympathoactivation may promote vascular&#xD;
      remodeling and can induce significant cardiovascular morbidity.&#xD;
