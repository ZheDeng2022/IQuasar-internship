  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder is a chronic and often disabling illness affecting 1-2% of US adults. Peer&#xD;
      support programs are an innovative and promising model to reverse demoralization, activate&#xD;
      consumers to seek more effective care, develop consumers' self-management skills, and restore&#xD;
      participation in work and other social roles. Peer-led programs can address key barriers to&#xD;
      dissemination of effective psychosocial treatment. This pilot effectiveness trial will&#xD;
      evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of a structured peer support&#xD;
      program based on the Certified Peer Specialist Program of the Depression and Bipolar Support&#xD;
      Alliance (DBSA). Following the philosophy of recovery, the intervention focuses on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Motivating consumers to develop an expectation of recovery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Encouraging regular self-monitoring of mood symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Training consumers to develop self-management skills for symptom control and problem&#xD;
           solving&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Activating consumers to be more informed partners in care and more effective&#xD;
           self-advocates&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Motivating and assisting consumers to reclaim work and other rewarding social roles&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use a rigorous research design to evaluate how structured peer support&#xD;
      promotes core values of mental health recovery. Impact of the intervention will be judged&#xD;
      across a range of outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Long-term control of mood disorder symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optimal participation in work and other rewarding social roles&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consumers' perceptions of autonomy and full participation in the treatment process&#xD;
           Findings from this pilot study will inform the development of a full-scale effectiveness&#xD;
           trial to include a broader range of participants and health care settings.&#xD;
