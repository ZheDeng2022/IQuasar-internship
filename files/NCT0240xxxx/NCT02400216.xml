      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Hepatitis C infection (HCV) is a leading cause of liver disease. Normal bacteria from the&#xD;
      intestines may spread to the liver and blood during liver disease. This is called bacterial&#xD;
      translocation (BT). Researchers think BT may cause liver disease to worsen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study the mechanisms involved in BT in early and advanced liver disease. To find out&#xD;
      whether BT causes liver disease to worsen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People over age 18 with HCV and clinically stable liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam. They will have&#xD;
           blood tests and imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have 2 outpatient visits and a 3-day stay at the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At visit 1, participants will have urine and blood tests. They will have a magnetic&#xD;
           resonance imaging (MRI) scan. A solution will be injected into a vein. The MRI scanner&#xD;
           is a metal cylinder surrounded by a magnetic field. The participant will lie on a table&#xD;
           that slides in and out of the cylinder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At visit 2, a substance will be injected into a vein and swallowed. Participants will&#xD;
           then have blood drawn 5 times over 90 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the inpatient stay, serial blood tests will be drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will give 2 stool samples and have another MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A needle will be inserted through the chest wall into a vein inside the liver, guided by&#xD;
           ultrasound. The blood pressure inside this vein will be measured and blood will be drawn&#xD;
           from it. About 1 inch of liver tissue will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A study investigator will call participants to discuss all test results.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C (HCV) is a leading cause of cirrhosis worldwide. Most complications associated&#xD;
      with cirrhosis are driven by an altered portal circulation and the development of portal&#xD;
      hypertension. Bacterial translocation (BT) from the gut to the systemic circulation is&#xD;
      considered a pivotal mechanism contributing to the development of life-threatening&#xD;
      complications in end stage cirrhosis. Recent evidence suggests that the liver and systemic&#xD;
      circulation may be exposed to gut derived microbial products at earlier stages of liver&#xD;
      disease. This early exposure may trigger hepatic inflammation, modify immune host response&#xD;
      and accelerate hepatic fibrogenesis; which, in turn, impairs portal inflow, alters the portal&#xD;
      circulation, and leads to development of portal hypertension. The mechanisms resulting in&#xD;
      systemic exposure to gut derived microbial products, and the subsequent host response to BT&#xD;
      has not been studied in patients with early liver disease nor fully compensated cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We therefore intend to enroll 30 chronic HCV patients with either cirrhosis (20) or minimal&#xD;
      liver fibrosis (10). Study participants will undergo extensive evaluation with portal vein&#xD;
      sampling and pressure measurements, dual cholate clearances, liver biopsy, serologic,&#xD;
      immunologic, fecal microbiome and imaging studies. This will be followed by an optional&#xD;
      second percutaneous liver biopsy and portal vein sampling 9-15 months after HCV treatment.&#xD;
      The treatment protocol is a separate independent protocol, 15-DK- 0143 utilizing Sofosbuvir&#xD;
      and GS-5816. The goals of our study are to characterize the extent of BT in early stages of&#xD;
      cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic liver disease, explore the mechanisms contributing to its&#xD;
      occurrence and identify potential serological, immunological and hemodynamic biomarkers&#xD;
      associated with chronic infection. This, in turn, can aid in establishing a possible link&#xD;
      between BT, subsequent host responses and severity of liver disease.&#xD;
