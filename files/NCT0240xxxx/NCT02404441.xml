  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this &quot;first-in-human&quot; study of PDR001 was to characterize the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and antitumor activity of PDR001&#xD;
      administered i.v. as a single agent to adult patients with solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By blocking the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, PDR001 inhibits&#xD;
      the PD-1 immune checkpoint, resulting in activation of an antitumor immune response by&#xD;
      activating effector T-cells and inhibiting regulatory T-cells.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study was designed as a phase I/II, multi-center, open-label study starting with a phase&#xD;
      I dose escalation part followed by a phase II part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the study had 2 'arms', the phase I part of the study had 5 dosing cohorts and the&#xD;
      phase ll part had 5 treatment groups for a total of 10 reporting groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PDR001 was administered every 2 weeks until patient experienced unacceptable toxicity,&#xD;
      progressive disease per immune related Response Criteria (irRC) and/or treatment was&#xD;
      discontinued at the discretion of the investigator or the patient.&#xD;

        mutation is detected in EGFR. Patients with ALK translocation-positive NSCLC must have had&#xD;
        disease progression following treatment with a corresponding inhibitor and no more than one&#xD;
        systemic chemotherapy regimen (platinum doublet-based), in any sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Group 2: Melanoma:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients must have been tested for BRAF mutations. Patients with V600 mutation positive&#xD;
        melanoma must have clinical or radiological evidence of disease progression during or after&#xD;
        treatment with a BRAF inhibitor alone or in combination with other agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Group 3: Triple negatice breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Group 4: Anaplastic thyroid cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients are not required to have received or progressed on a prior therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not be at short term risk for life threatening complications (such as&#xD;
             airway compromise or bleeding from locoregional or metastatic disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chemoradiation and/or surgery should be considered prior to study entry for those&#xD;
             patients with locally advanced disease if those therapies are considered to be in the&#xD;
             best interest of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ECOG Performance Status ≤ 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients must have a site of disease amenable to biopsy, and be a candidate for&#xD;
                  tumor biopsy. Patient must be willing to undergo a new tumor biopsy at baseline&#xD;
                  or at molecular pre-screening if applicable, and during therapy on this study.&#xD;
                  For patients in the phase II part of the study, exceptions may be granted after&#xD;
                  documented discussion with Novartis. After a sufficient number of paired biopsies&#xD;
                  are collected, the decision may be taken to stop the collection of biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;

          -  Systemic anti-cancer therapy within 2 weeks of the first dose of study treatment. For&#xD;
             cytotoxic agents that have major delayed toxicity, e.g. mitomycin C and nitrosoureas,&#xD;
             4 weeks washout period. For patients receiving anticancer immunotherapies such as&#xD;
             CTLA-4 antagonists, 6 weeks is indicated as the washout period.&#xD;
