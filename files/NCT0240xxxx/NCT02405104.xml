      Introduction and rationale Background Modern treatment of pain following surgery based on&#xD;
      multimodal analgesic strategy where the pain system different points of attack struck with&#xD;
      different types analgesics. This also tries to reduce the consumption of opioids associated&#xD;
      with frequent side effects like nausea, vomiting, constipation, difficulty urinating, weather&#xD;
      stretch problems and Lethargy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      But in spite of intense research over the last decades, is pain after arthroplastic surgery&#xD;
      in hip (total hip arthroplasty (THA)) or knee (total knee replacement (TKA)) continue a&#xD;
      significant clinical problem. It is a current clinical assumption that patients with pain in&#xD;
      the hip or knee region immediately after TKA or THA have tense muscles, which reinforces pain&#xD;
      behavior. The mechanism for such muscle tension is not fully understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For many years the investigators have been on Danish orthopedic departments dealt with these&#xD;
      patients with postoperative pain after major joint prosthesis operations with the muscle&#xD;
      relaxant chlorzoxazone. On some sections included in the standard chlorzoxazone prescriptions&#xD;
      for pain after hip and knee replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      chlorzoxazone has for many years been marketed for the treatment of pain in skeletal muscle&#xD;
      by inhibition of mono- and polysynaptic reflexes in the CNS. The muscle relaxing effect is&#xD;
      mediated by inhibitory effects on spinal polysynaptic reflexes. In placebo-designed clinical&#xD;
      studies of chlorzoxazone's beneficial effect on heterogeneous groups of patients with&#xD;
      spasticity, motor neuron syndromes, as well as muscle pain and spasm of peripheral&#xD;
      musculoskeletal diseases have not been able to demonstrate no significant analgesic effect;&#xD;
      chlorzoxazone have also failed to show pain-relieving effect in the treatment of back pain It&#xD;
      is remarkable that in spite of the widespread use of chlorzoxazone not can be found only one&#xD;
      study of chlorzoxazone used as adjuvant pain relieving treatment after hip or knee surgery&#xD;
      (or other orthopaedic treatment). The current clinical practice is therefore made on purely&#xD;
      empirical basis. The effect must be considered as uncertain, but may in some cases be&#xD;
      indicated, most often as an adjunct to other therapy, for example analgesics,&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory agents, physiotherapy or even training. In such cases, regarded&#xD;
      chlorzoxazone be an alternative to benzodiazepines. There is therefore a need for a&#xD;
      prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the potential&#xD;
      analgesic effect of chlorzoxazone. In this intervention study is the selected dosage of&#xD;
      chlorzoxazone set at based on the recommendation of the Danish Medicines Information A / S 7&#xD;
      (http://pro.medicin.dk/Medicine / Preparations / 638) and Takeda Pharma A / S. The latter&#xD;
      produces chlorzoxazone. The recommendation is based on our current knowledge of&#xD;
      chlorzoxazones pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. chlorzoxazone given in this&#xD;
      study as tablet chlorzoxazone, 250 mg, 3 times daily for the first seven postoperative days.&#xD;
      Adverse reactions to chlorzoxazone are well known. They are relatively few, mostly mild and&#xD;
      transient. The most frequent adverse events related to chlorzoxazone, fatigue and dizziness&#xD;
      (about 1-10% of patients) Adverse reactions are to some extent overlapping with the side&#xD;
      effects that are related to the perioperative opioid treatment. It is therefore possible that&#xD;
      the frequency of adverse events overall is reduced if chlorzoxazone found to be analgesic&#xD;
      (and opioid-sparing). Patients will be hospitalized for a minimum of two nights after surgery&#xD;
      and thus be close observation in the period in which the risk of side effects is greatest. At&#xD;
      the same time, all patients undergo standardized adverse event registration. If, contrary to&#xD;
      expectations unexpected or unacceptable side effects medication will promptly be interrupted.&#xD;
      The study involves a group of patients (THA and TKA), which is an important clinical pain&#xD;
      problem. All of these patients receive a well-implemented and evidence-based treatment. Thus,&#xD;
      anesthesia, analgesia and surgical procedure standardized for all patients receiving&#xD;
      concomitant consequences usual principles of early mobilization 8; 9th The planned&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design in which all patients receive the same&#xD;
      and standardized interventions, enabling the best possible evaluation of modality under study&#xD;
      intervention with chlorzoxazone vs. placebo). The level of pain after surgery as the primary&#xD;
      endpoint, recorded by means of a well-tested and validated tool (visual analog scale (VAS))&#xD;
      48 hours after operation. The current study could contribute to a clarification of the&#xD;
      postoperative analgesic effect of chlorzoxazone immediately after THA and TKA. As secondary&#xD;
      endpoints, the patients functional level be determined Oxford Hip / Knee Score 7 days after&#xD;
      surgery. Furthermore, a number of tertiary parameters related to pain, function and side&#xD;
      effect profile be determined as shown in Table 1. Evidence in this area will be of immediate&#xD;
      benefit to patients operated with THA and TKA - and maybe for other surgical patients.&#xD;
