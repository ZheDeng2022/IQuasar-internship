      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Nanosilver is tiny silver particles. Many products contain nanosilver, like antimicrobial&#xD;
      cleaning supplies and antimicrobial fabrics. Some products also contain nanosilver in a&#xD;
      solution that people inhale. The companies that make these products claim they can help boost&#xD;
      the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To learn if inhaling nanosilver affects the lung s immune system. In addition, to see if&#xD;
      nanosilver affects lung function and if it gets absorbed into the bloodstream after it is&#xD;
      inhaled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy, non-smoking adults ages 18 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be pre-screened by phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will then be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will&#xD;
           give blood and urine samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have lung function tests. They will breathe into a spirometer. It has&#xD;
           a mouthpiece attached to a tube that is connected to a computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a methacholine challenge test. They will blow into a spirometer.&#xD;
           Then they will inhale methacholine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible participants will have 3 study visits over 2 5 weeks. At each visit, they will&#xD;
           repeat some of the screening tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At visit 1, participants will have a bronchoscopy. For this, an intravenous line is&#xD;
           placed in an arm vein. Electrodes are placed on the chest. A tube is placed through the&#xD;
           nose and into the airways. The airway is washed. A sample of cells is taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At visit 2, participants will get the study treatment. They will inhale a nanosilver&#xD;
           solution mist. They will have lung function tests before and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will collect their urine from the time they get the treatment until they&#xD;
           return to the clinic the next day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At visit 3, participants will turn in their urine. They will have another bronchoscopy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, single-arm pilot study to assess the impact of inhaled silver&#xD;
      nanoparticles (nanosilver or nAg) on immune responses in the lung. Non-smoking, healthy&#xD;
      adults (no lung or cardiovascular conditions), age 18-60 will be recruited to participate;&#xD;
      pregnant or breastfeeding women will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be prescreened by telephone and scheduled for a final eligibility&#xD;
      visit that will include vital signs/anthropometry, medical/medication history review,&#xD;
      physical exam, urine tests, blood draw, urine collection, and pulmonary function tests (PFTs;&#xD;
      i.e., spirometry and methacholine challenge test). After eligibility is confirmed, the&#xD;
      participant will be scheduled for a baseline visit, which includes vital signs/anthropometry,&#xD;
      medical/medication history review, physical exam, blood draw, urine collection, and&#xD;
      bronchoscopy (with lavage and brushing). Participants will return 14-40 days between the&#xD;
      baseline visit and study treatment visit, which includes vital signs/anthropometry, blood&#xD;
      draw, urine collection, spirometry, one-time administration of ionic silver via nebulizer,&#xD;
      and instructions to collect urine for 24 hours. The next day after the study treatment visit,&#xD;
      the participant will return for a visit that includes vital signs/anthropometry, blood draw,&#xD;
      providing the 24-hour urine sample, spirometry, and bronchoscopy. During each bronchoscopy&#xD;
      procedure, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and tissue from bronchial brushings will be&#xD;
      collected from the participant to obtain alveolar macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to determine whether exposure to nanosilver alters the&#xD;
      immune responses of lung cells. The primary laboratory analysis will determine whether&#xD;
      exposure to nanosilver mediates a change from baseline in the response of&#xD;
      bronchoscopy-derived, cultured macrophages or epithelial cells to challenge with a toll-like&#xD;
      receptor (TLR) agonist. Additional analyses will assess changes in cytokine levels in BAL&#xD;
      fluid, changes in the lung microbiome, silver penetration into the blood stream, silver&#xD;
      excretion in the urine, and changes in PFT measures.&#xD;
