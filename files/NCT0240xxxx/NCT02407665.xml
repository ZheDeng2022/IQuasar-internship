    <textblock>
      This exploratory study proposal is the first pilot brain imaging study to determine if Tai&#xD;
      Chi can modulate brain resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) and brain morphometry&#xD;
      among fibromyalgia (FM) patients and healthy controls.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty-four FM patients and 24 age matched healthy control will be recruited. All FM patients&#xD;
      will undergo Tai Chi intervention twice weekly for 12 weeks of practice. fMRI resting state&#xD;
      and brain structure data will be collected before and after treatment. For the healthy&#xD;
      control group, the fMRI and structure data will only be collected once, contemporaneous with&#xD;
      the 12 week scan for the fibromyalgia patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be rsFC of rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), a key region in&#xD;
      descending pain modulatory system (DPMS). The secondary outcome include change of the&#xD;
      cortical thickness changes, fibromyalgia symptom severity, widespread pain index, depression,&#xD;
      stress/anxiety, sleep quality, and quality of life. Covariates include age, gender, body mass&#xD;
      index, disease duration, depression, and comorbidities. Clinical outcome measurements will be&#xD;
      collected at baseline and after 12 weeks of intervention for the fibromyalgia cohort and at a&#xD;
      single visit for the healthy controls. The Tai Chi classes will be taught at Tufts Medical&#xD;
      Center and the fMRI scans will be performed at Massachusetts General Hospital Martinos&#xD;
      Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will advance science in the field of mind-body medicine for chronic pain&#xD;
      management, both mechanistically and clinically.&#xD;
