    <textblock>
      Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is very common and causes much pain and disability. It costs the&#xD;
      NHS billions of pounds in treatment every year and is the second leading cause of time off&#xD;
      work. There are various treatments for CLBP, but the most effective are still only moderately&#xD;
      helpful. Most people with CLBP receive physiotherapy, with varying results. Cognitive&#xD;
      behaviour therapy (CBT) may offer more long term help than current treatments because it&#xD;
      enables people to self-manage their condition. A new type of CBT, called Acceptance and&#xD;
      Commitment Therapy (ACT), has produced particularly good results for chronic pain. However, a&#xD;
      shortage of clinical psychologists means that most patients never receive CBT.&#xD;
      Physiotherapists can successfully use CBT techniques with extra training, but this is not&#xD;
      standard practice and ACT-based physiotherapy treatment has never been tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have developed a short ACT-based treatment (PACT) for physiotherapists to&#xD;
      deliver and aim to compare it with usual physiotherapy care. The investigators will recruit&#xD;
      240 people with CLBP from three hospitals in South East London. They will be randomly divided&#xD;
      into two groups, with half receiving PACT and the other half ordinary physiotherapy. PACT&#xD;
      consists of two hour long sessions and one follow-up phone call, meaning fewer hospital&#xD;
      visits for patients and more time during sessions for individualised treatment. It aims to&#xD;
      encourage people to focus less on getting rid of their pain and more on moving forward with&#xD;
      what is most important in their lives. The investigators will compare PACT with usual&#xD;
      physiotherapy to see which is most successful at improving people's ability to function and&#xD;
      their quality of life and which approach helps them to manage their back pain best in the&#xD;
      long term. If PACT is effective, the investigators believe it could reduce the considerable&#xD;
      burden of CLBP to patients, the NHS and society.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Back pain causes considerable suffering and is a major financial burden, costing the NHS an&#xD;
      estimated £1.1 billion annually (Maniadakis and Gray 2000) and representing the second&#xD;
      largest cause of absence from work (Young and Bhaumik, 2011). Chronic low back pain (CLBP),&#xD;
      defined as pain lasting more than 12 weeks, is responsible for 80% of this cost (Department&#xD;
      of Health, 2009). Physiotherapy is a common treatment for CLBP, with 1.26 million patients&#xD;
      referred to NHS physiotherapists at a cost of £150 million per annum (Maniadakis and Gray,&#xD;
      2000). Several forms of physiotherapy are recommended for CLBP, including exercises, manual&#xD;
      therapy and back classes (NICE, 2009). The type of physiotherapy varies considerably in&#xD;
      duration and content, despite evidence that different treatments have similar effects&#xD;
      (Critchley et al, 2007). Most trials show no clear superiority for any treatment, with the&#xD;
      majority leading to only moderate improvement (Artus et al 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A key focus of treatment is helping people with persistent CLBP to self-manage their&#xD;
      condition and thus improve pain, disability and distress to ensure that an episode of low&#xD;
      back pain does not result in long-term withdrawal from normal activities, including sickness&#xD;
      absence from paid employment. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has a good evidence base&#xD;
      for the treatment of chronic pain (Eccleston et al, 2009; Hoffman et al, 2007; Scascighini et&#xD;
      al, 2008) and the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy recognises that CBT can fall within a&#xD;
      physiotherapist's scope of practice (Donaghy et al 2008). However, CBT-based treatments&#xD;
      delivered by physiotherapist have only produced modest improvements in CLBP (Lamb et al.,&#xD;
      2010) and it remains unclear how to best implement cognitive and behavioural approaches&#xD;
      during physiotherapy interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One promising theory-based approach to chronic pain is a form of CBT called Acceptance and&#xD;
      Commitment Therapy (ACT) (Hayes et al., 1999). The primary focus of ACT is on enhancing&#xD;
      psychological flexibility and reducing struggle with pain. This involves helping people to&#xD;
      accept their pain and related feelings, become more aware and less dominated by thoughts and&#xD;
      beliefs about pain, and identify and follow directions in life that reflect their values&#xD;
      (Vowles et al, 2011). A meta-analysis of ACT for chronic pain showed improvements in&#xD;
      depression, anxiety, pain intensity, physical functioning and quality of life (Veehof et al,&#xD;
      2011). It has good maintenance of treatment effects up to three years post treatment (Vowles&#xD;
      et al 2011), important in a chronic relapsing and remitting condition like CLBP. This&#xD;
      suggests that ACT-based interventions could be well suited to patients with CLBP. In all&#xD;
      published studies to date, ACT has been delivered by psychologists or within&#xD;
      multidisciplinary teams but there is very limited availability of clinical psychologists for&#xD;
      CLBP and most patients referred to secondary care are seen by physiotherapists not&#xD;
      psychologists (Maniadakis and Gray, 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a novel physiotherapy intervention incorporating&#xD;
      the newest and most promising form of CBT, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) against&#xD;
      usual physiotherapy care. The investigators believe this will optimise outcome for patients,&#xD;
      the NHS and society at large. The investigators have conducted a proof of concept feasibility&#xD;
      study to develop a brief physiotherapist-delivered ACT-based intervention, 'PACT', consisting&#xD;
      of two one hour sessions plus a follow-up phone call. The aim is to test PACT against usual&#xD;
      physiotherapy care in a phase 2 trial. The main research question is whether PACT&#xD;
      (physiotherapist delivered ACT-based treatment) is effective. The investigators hypothesise&#xD;
      that the group receiving PACT will have improved function at 3 months compared to the&#xD;
      treatment as usual group, and that this will be maintained at 12 months. The primary&#xD;
      objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of PACT, a novel brief ACT-based&#xD;
      physiotherapy intervention for chronic low back pain, at the primary end point of function at&#xD;
      3 months follow-up.&#xD;
