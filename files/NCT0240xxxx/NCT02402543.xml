      The perianal region is the region around the anus. Administering a pain medication before a&#xD;
      surgery starts is called preemptive analgesia. In some studies, this technique has been shown&#xD;
      to be an effective way to reduce the pain that a patient experiences in the post-operative&#xD;
      timeframe to a greater extent than would be expected simply from the pain medications alone.&#xD;
      One theory of why this occurs suggests that the preemptive analgesia desensitizes brain and&#xD;
      nerves to pain, thereby decreasing the response to painful stimuli, like surgery when they&#xD;
      occur. This leads to a decrease in the amount of narcotic pain medication required after the&#xD;
      procedure, which leads to less side effects and a quicker return to normal functioning. As&#xD;
      perianal surgeries do not usually include a long stay in the hospital, controlling&#xD;
      post-procedure pain is a priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of preemptive analgesia is in other types of surgeries, such as orthopedics, is well&#xD;
      established, but as the perianal region has not been well studied, its use is not the&#xD;
      standard of care. This type of analgesia uses a combination of medications that are already&#xD;
      in use for post-operative and non-operative pain control and administers them orally prior to&#xD;
      the patient undergoing general anesthesia. The side effects of the medications are the same&#xD;
      as if they had been given after surgery or for non-surgical pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concept of preemptive analgesia is established in other types of surgeries and it has&#xD;
      solid basic science to support its use. The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, placebo&#xD;
      controlled study is to determine if patients undergoing perianal surgeries could benefit from&#xD;
      preemptive pain control. The primary outcome will be whether patients experience less&#xD;
      post-operative pain. Patient post-operative consumption and latency until use of narcotic&#xD;
      pain medication will be the secondary outcomes. The investigators believe that the patients&#xD;
      receiving pain medications before their operation will require less pain medication after&#xD;
      surgery, with minimal increased risk to the patient.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Despite advances in pain medicine, postoperative pain control remains problematic with over&#xD;
      5% of patients experiencing severe pain despite standard of care pain management, and is a&#xD;
      frequently cited reason for delayed discharge in outpatient procedures [1]. In anorectal&#xD;
      surgeries, almost all patients experience mild-to-moderate postoperative subjective pain [2],&#xD;
      and as an example 12% of patients report severe postoperative pain during their recovery from&#xD;
      hemorrhoidectomy surgery [3]. Control of postoperative pain is an important goal. Preemptive&#xD;
      analgesia is a technique that involves premedicating the patient with a regimen of&#xD;
      medications designed to target different points in the pain cascade to prevent central and&#xD;
      peripheral sensitization to pain, also known as &quot;wind-up&quot; [4]. The activation of&#xD;
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors is an identified process that occurs in central&#xD;
      sensitization after a noxious stimulus. By pharmacologically blocking these receptors, it may&#xD;
      be possible to prevent or suppress the degree of central sensitization, which can prevent the&#xD;
      hyperalgesic, or exaggerated pain response, that some patients experience [5]. Peripheral&#xD;
      sensitization is a similar concept and occurs due to noxious stimuli in the periphery, such&#xD;
      as a surgical incision. This type of sensitization has typically been prevented with regional&#xD;
      anesthesia and by increasing the nociceptive threshold of the neurons with different&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preemptive analgesia focusing on the effect of single medications on pain control has shown&#xD;
      promising results, however some studies appear to lend themselves to practice [6-19] better&#xD;
      than others [20-26]. On the other hand, multimodal pain control regimens might be more&#xD;
      promising. A search of the literature reveals that preemptive pharmacological blockade of&#xD;
      wind up has been effectively used in both surgical and nonsurgical patients (burn patients&#xD;
      [27]). In patients undergoing hip arthroplasty, or hip replacement surgery, under general&#xD;
      anesthesia, blocking both central and peripheral sensitization results in significantly&#xD;
      decreased subjective pain, and a trend toward less postoperative use of analgesics [28].&#xD;
      Similarly, patients undergoing multilevel spinal surgeries [29] and those undergoing&#xD;
      prostatic surgery [30] under general anesthesia consume less postoperative analgesics when&#xD;
      undergoing multimodal preemptive pain control by blocking both sensitization pathways.&#xD;
      Finally, preemptive central sensitization blockade alone has been used with trends in&#xD;
      improved pain control for gynecological surgeries under both general [31] and regional&#xD;
      anesthesia [32]. The preemptive use of such medications has not been studied for anorectal&#xD;
      surgeries and it is what we are suggesting in this study. Most pain control studies in the&#xD;
      literature focus on postoperative rather than preemptive medication regimens for pain&#xD;
      management [33-35], and there is no current standard of care as to an effective regimen. The&#xD;
      studies effective in decreasing postoperative pain in other surgical contexts, such as for&#xD;
      patients undergoing hip arthroplasty, have used the same combination of medications proposed&#xD;
      for the Treatment Group. Finally, the added benefit of the anorectal patient population in&#xD;
      terms of the putative decreased use of opioids for postoperative pain control revolves around&#xD;
      the opioid-related adverse effects on bowel function. In fact, return of bowel movements and&#xD;
      regularity is one criterion for healing after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this existing literature, we propose in our current study to preemptively block both&#xD;
      central sensitization through the use of intravenous ketamine perioperatively and peripheral&#xD;
      sensitization through the use of intravenous dexamethasone administered perioperatively and&#xD;
      oral gabapentin and acetaminophen administered preoperatively. Ketamine is a noncompetitive&#xD;
      NMDA receptor antagonist acting centrally in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord to decrease&#xD;
      the release of glutamate, reducing the transmission of pain messages centrally [36].&#xD;
      Intravenous ketamine has been shown to decrease 24-hour opioid requirements, and preemptive&#xD;
      use of ketamine was part of the medications used in most of the studies mentioned in the&#xD;
      literature review above. As it currently stands, use of ketamine in anorectal surgeries as an&#xD;
      added analgesic has been proven safe. Among Nigerian surgery patients having received&#xD;
      regional anesthesia and preemptive ketamine, postoperative pain levels have been shown to&#xD;
      decrease, however it is unclear if this patient cohort included anorectal surgery patients&#xD;
      [37]. No other studies have been conducted regarding postoperative pain in these patients&#xD;
      [38]. By utilizing ketamine as one of the medications in our study, we hope to show similar&#xD;
      effects resulting in patients experiencing decreased postoperative pain after common&#xD;
      anorectal surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid with potent anti-inflammatory effects that is also used as&#xD;
      an anti-emetic. The proposed mechanism of action of dexamethasone is not completely known,&#xD;
      but it is thought to involve inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis and an increased release&#xD;
      of endorphins. Endorphins are endogenous peptides that bind to pain receptors in the body to&#xD;
      decrease pain. In addition, endorphins can facilitate mood elevation and a sense of&#xD;
      well-being. Intravenous dexamethasone was part of the medications used in studies mentioned&#xD;
      in the literature review above. One study investigating the prophylactic use of dexamethasone&#xD;
      for its anti-emetic properties, in combination with sevoflurane, a general anesthetic, during&#xD;
      anorectal surgery found a significant decrease in maximal postoperative VAS pain scores in&#xD;
      patients administered dexamethasone compared to those given placebos [2]. The use of&#xD;
      dexamethasone as a preemptive analgesic has not been fully studied in anorectal surgery&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gabapentin acts by binding to receptors on voltage-gated calcium channels on presynaptic&#xD;
      nerves, reducing the entry of calcium into presynaptic nerve terminals. The subsequent&#xD;
      decreased release of excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate, aspartate, substance P,&#xD;
      and norepinephrine into the synaptic cleft is linked to a diminished postsynaptic&#xD;
      transmission of neural pain messages [36]. It is usually used for neuropathic pain control,&#xD;
      and has been used in some of the studies mentioned in the literature review above. A systemic&#xD;
      review of the perioperative effects of gabapentin found that it is an effective means of&#xD;
      reducing post-operative pain, opioid consumption, and opioid-related adverse effects in&#xD;
      surgical patients. In fact, administration of a single dose of gabapentin was found to be&#xD;
      equivalent to a reduction of 30 mg of morphine in the first 24 hours after surgery [39]. No&#xD;
      studies have been conducted, to the best of our knowledge, regarding preemptive use of&#xD;
      gabapentin in anorectal surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local, peripheral sensitization has also been minimized through the use of non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) due to the decreased production of certain molecules such as&#xD;
      prostaglandins and kinins. The enzyme required to make these molecules is blocked by&#xD;
      acetaminophen and NSAIDs, which is why acetaminophen is included in this study in hopes of&#xD;
      demonstrating better pain control among anorectal surgery patients. Acetaminophen is a weak&#xD;
      analgesic that forms the most basic component of a multimodal analgesia regimen [36]. Oral&#xD;
      preemptive use of acetaminophen has been proven to decrease postoperative narcotic use in&#xD;
      surgical patients [40], and has been used in some of the studies mentioned in the literature&#xD;
      review above. A related intramuscular NSAID, namely Toradol, has been used preemptively among&#xD;
      anorectal surgical patients with good pain control [41]. No other studies are reported in&#xD;
      this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of importance, the combinations of the medications used in this study have been used in other&#xD;
      studies before with similar or higher doses and no significant differences in terms of&#xD;
      hemodynamic variables (such as vital signs) or adverse side effects have been noted compared&#xD;
      to control groups [31]. In fact, these medications are safely used at UVM Medical Center by&#xD;
      the collaborating surgeons as part of their care for other surgeries such as abdominal&#xD;
      surgeries.&#xD;
