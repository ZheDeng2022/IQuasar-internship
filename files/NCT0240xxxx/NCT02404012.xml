  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a high prevalence of iron deficiency in patients who undergo bariatric surgery and&#xD;
      effective therapies are lacking. Thus, there is a critical need for an effective,&#xD;
      non-invasive, and inexpensive form of iron supplementation to treat iron deficiency and&#xD;
      improve tolerance, the associated cognitive symptoms, and quality of life in the bariatric&#xD;
      surgery patient population. Often, patients do not participate in bariatric programs, are not&#xD;
      compliant, and/or are lost to follow-up. If there is a more effective and evidence-based&#xD;
      guideline for repletion of iron deficiency, patients are more likely to be compliant.&#xD;
      Therefore, in a randomized controlled study, the investigators propose to test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of various iron formulations versus ferrous sulfate, which is the standard of&#xD;
      care, for oral iron supplementation of iron deficient patients who have had RYGB or SG&#xD;
      bariatric surgery. By randomizing patients into the two groups, the investigators will be&#xD;
      able to determine the most effective regimen to improve blood biomarkers of iron status,&#xD;
      cognitive function, and quality of life. Other outcomes will include adverse effects and&#xD;
      compliance to the supplementation. The investigators will also analyze three-day food records&#xD;
      to determine the contribution of dietary factors to changes in iron status. To test for&#xD;
      improvement of iron status, serial blood draws will be performed during a time period of ~10&#xD;
      weeks. Serial blood draws from iron deficient patients have routinely been performed in past&#xD;
      studies and have not been found to be harmful. Because this is a relatively short study (10&#xD;
      weeks), subjects will be able to recover quickly from the blood loss during the study. The&#xD;
      investigators expect to find that iron supplementation with organic formulations of iron will&#xD;
      be as effective than ferrous sulfate for repletion of iron deficiency, and they will be&#xD;
      better tolerated. This project will address a significant health issue in individuals who&#xD;
      have had bariatric surgery, which is a growing population in the United States. It is&#xD;
      estimated that almost 1.5 million individuals have undergone bariatric surgery since the year&#xD;
      1990.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the most effective oral iron supplementation regimen for repletion of iron&#xD;
           deficiency in patients who have had gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy. In iron&#xD;
           deficient patients, two supplement regimens will be compared:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Ferrous sulfate 65 mg t.i.d. (standard of care / control), which is elemental iron&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. AspironTM, which is an organic formulation of iron&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary outcomes will be reference indices of iron status:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Ferritin, TIBC, sTfR, and sTfR:ferritin ratio&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Secondary outcomes will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  measures of anemia, determined by blood hemoglobin concentrations&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  measures of cognitive function via several computerized tests on working memory,&#xD;
                sustained attention, and spatial memory&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  fatigue by Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Quality of life by SF-36 Survey&#xD;
&#xD;
           Safety outcomes will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
           â€¢ adverse events, compliance, measures of iron toxicity, and liver enzymes&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In the same subjects undergoing iron supplementation described in Aim 1, to determine&#xD;
           the contribution of dietary factors (including heme and non-heme iron intake, and intake&#xD;
           of enhancers and inhibitors of iron absorption) to changes in iron status.&#xD;
