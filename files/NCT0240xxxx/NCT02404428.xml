  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is a major public health problem and there is a strong need of new preventive&#xD;
      strategies based on drug and lifestyle interventions. It is now well-established that healthy&#xD;
      eating patterns and increasing physical activity can prevent or delay prostate cancer&#xD;
      progression. Intake of cruciferous vegetables (e.g. broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels&#xD;
      sprouts, kale) has been associated with decreased risk of prostate cancer progression;&#xD;
      however the underlying biological mechanisms remain unknown. The investigators propose to&#xD;
      undertake a pilot study on a group of men with early prostate cancer on active surveillance&#xD;
      to determine whether a diet rich in broccoli will induce changes in tumor size and blood flow&#xD;
      measured by conventional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques. Men with early prostate&#xD;
      cancer on active surveillance who have visible cancer lesions on MRI will be recruited onto&#xD;
      this double-blinded randomized intervention and they will be asked to eat one portion of&#xD;
      broccoli soup per week for 6 months. The investigators will test two varieties of broccoli&#xD;
      (standard and 'Beneforte extra' broccoli) that are able to deliver two different levels of&#xD;
      sulforaphane (SF), an active compound extensively studied for its potential anticancer&#xD;
      properties. This study will involve MRI scans, blood and urine collection before and after a&#xD;
      6 month intervention period. This study design will not only allow us to observe diet-induced&#xD;
      changes within the prostate but also at the systemic level. In addition, participant's&#xD;
      lifestyle (habitual diet and physical activity) will be assessed by food diaries and exercise&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has been funded by Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)&#xD;
      and Prostate Cancer foundation (PCF).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomised double-blinded dietary intervention study. The study population&#xD;
      will consist of men (n=20) aged 18-80 years with a BMI between 19.5 and 35 kg/m2 with low&#xD;
      risk prostate cancer (prostate specific antigen [PSA] &lt; 10ng/ml; Gleason grade 6; T category&#xD;
      T1 or T2) or intermediate risk prostate cancer patients (PSA 10-20ng/ml; Gleason 7 (including&#xD;
      selected 4+3 cases that will not be advised for radical prostatectomy; T category T1 or T2)&#xD;
      who have visible lesions on MRI and have already decided to take up active&#xD;
      surveillance/monitoring. The investigators chose these inclusion criteria because they&#xD;
      reflect the population of men on active surveillance that the investigators are currently&#xD;
      recruiting in the ESCAPE study (Effect of Sulforaphane on Prostate CAncer PrEvention;&#xD;
      ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01950143) via the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital.&#xD;
      Volunteers recruited onto this study will be randomly allocated to one of two arms in which&#xD;
      they will be required to consume one portion of broccoli soup per week, delivering different&#xD;
      levels of glucoraphanin (SF precursor) in each study arm. This will be part of their normal&#xD;
      diet for 6 months. The two soups will contain standard broccoli (i), or&#xD;
      glucoraphanin-enriched broccoli named for the study 'Beneforte extra' (ii). The study will&#xD;
      involve MRI monitoring at baseline and after 6 months. In addition the investigators will&#xD;
      collect blood and urine samples at baseline and after 6 months. The volunteers' habitual diet&#xD;
      and physical activity will also be assessed during the intervention period.&#xD;
