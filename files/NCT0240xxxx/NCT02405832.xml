      The objective of this study is to assess the effect of preoperative administration of oral&#xD;
      zinc lozenges on the incidence of postoperative sore throat syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When patients undergo surgery with general anesthesia, they require ventilation of their&#xD;
      lungs with the help of a flexible tube (called an endotracheal tube) that is placed through&#xD;
      the mouth, passing the vocal cords, and into the windpipe (trachea). This tube helps&#xD;
      oxygenate the patient, delivers anesthetic gas to the lungs, and keeps the airways open to&#xD;
      prevent asphyxiation. The procedure is invasive and uncomfortable, and one of the most common&#xD;
      consequences is a sore and inflamed throat after the tube is taken out. This is termed&#xD;
      postoperative sore throat (POST). Though the intensity and severity of sore throat varies&#xD;
      from person to person, the reported incidence is as high as 90% of patients undergoing&#xD;
      general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zinc therapy has been shown in multiple studies to reduce the severity and duration of cold&#xD;
      symptoms, and also to up-regulate the immune system. Recent studies have shown that zinc can&#xD;
      act as an anti-inflammatory agent and can maintain the integrity of skin and mucosal&#xD;
      membranes (which cover the inside of the mouth and throat). The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the effects of giving zinc lozenges before tube placement on postoperative sore&#xD;
      throat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After written informed consent is received in pre-op, a sealed and coded envelope with either&#xD;
      the zinc lozenge or the placebo lozenge will be given to the patient to be administered&#xD;
      orally, with the instruction to dissolve the lozenge by sucking on it 30 minutes prior to&#xD;
      surgery. Upon completion of surgery and emergence from general anesthesia, the patient will&#xD;
      be extubated and transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Once in the PACU, the&#xD;
      patient will be assessed regarding the incidence and severity of POST by the study&#xD;
      investigator using a standardized scale. The severity of POST will be graded on a 4-point&#xD;
      scale ranging from 0 to 3; 0 being no sore throat, 1 being mild discomfort (complains only&#xD;
      upon questioning), 2 being moderate sore throat (complains on his/her own), and 3 being&#xD;
      severe sore throat (change in voice, hoarseness, and throat pain). This evaluation will be&#xD;
      performed at 30 minutes, 2 hours, 4 hours, and 24 hours post-surgery, with the assessment at&#xD;
      4 hours being the primary outcome of the study.&#xD;

      The overall purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of preoperative&#xD;
      administration of oral zinc lozenges on postoperative sore throat syndrome which consists of&#xD;
      pain, dysphagia, and in extreme cases hoarseness. It is associated with coughing (which may&#xD;
      increase surgical related pain) and difficulty with oral intake. The study will look at the&#xD;
      changes in incidence and severity of POST in the immediate postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative sore throat (POST) syndrome is a very common complication of endotracheal&#xD;
      intubation Prior to earlier studies larger endotracheal tubes were utilized for providing&#xD;
      general anesthesia. The incidence of POST at that time was 48%, with smaller tubes the&#xD;
      incidence decreased to 22%. It is now standard of care to utilize endotracheal tubes based on&#xD;
      size and gender of the patient. In subsequent studies to further reduce the incidence of&#xD;
      POST, the rate of sore throat in the control groups have been between 17-90%. The cause of&#xD;
      POST is related to direct local tissue trauma leading to inflammation of the pharyngeal&#xD;
      mucosa and possibly the drying effect of non-humidified gases across the mucous membranes.&#xD;
      Although there have been multiple treatments recommended for POST, none of them have been&#xD;
      exactly effective, and the symptoms usually ameliorate within 72 hr without treatment. Even&#xD;
      though this is the case, it is still recommended to take preventive measures for POST. The&#xD;
      presence of POST after surgery is a patient satisfaction issue and has also been associated&#xD;
      with a longer stay in in the post anesthesia recovery unit(Higgins et al). Both pharmacologic&#xD;
      and non-pharmacologic measures have been recommended in past studies. Nonpharmacological&#xD;
      methods for attenuating POST have included using smaller-sized endotracheal tubes,&#xD;
      lubricating the endotracheal tube with water-soluble jelly, careful airway instrumentation,&#xD;
      and minimizing cuff pressure. Pharmacologic measures have included gargles with lidocaine,&#xD;
      aspirin, or ketamine preoperatively, inhalation of beclomethasone or fluticasone propionate,&#xD;
      and recently the use of licorice gargle or magnesium lozenges 30 min preoperatively&#xD;
      (Ruetzler, Borazan H).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zinc has been utilized for many years as a topical agent to promote epithelial health and&#xD;
      recovery after injury. Several studies have evaluated the effect of zinc on wound healing and&#xD;
      epithelial tissue health. These studies have shown that supplementation with zinc sulfate&#xD;
      causes rapid recovery of leg and gastric ulcers (Worthington et al). It seems zinc not only&#xD;
      increases re-epithelialization, but it also decreases bacterial activity and causes rapid&#xD;
      wound healing (Arbabi-kalati et al). Zinc has also been shown to be an immunomodulatory agent&#xD;
      that monitors and modifies the immune system and T-lymphocytes. Decreases in zinc serum&#xD;
      levels lead to lymphopenia and declines in cellular and humoral immunity. The effect of oral&#xD;
      zinc sulfate has also been utilized for treatment of oral wounds by oral surgeons; moreover,&#xD;
      research has shown zinc supplementation assists with the recovery of mucosal wounds and&#xD;
      treatment of tongue ulcers (Worthington et al). A recent study by Arbabi-kalati, showed that&#xD;
      high dose oral zinc sulfate (220 mg TID) decreased the intensity of mucositis, xerostomia,&#xD;
      and pain in individuals undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy treatments. The mechanism by&#xD;
      which zinc improves tissue health was investigated by Sharir et al. and in a model of&#xD;
      epithelial injury showed that topical zinc directly activates receptors that promote&#xD;
      epithelial repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Keeping the above studies in mind, the investigators built this study using the protocols&#xD;
      devised by Borazan H, in which they evaluated the efficacy of magnesium lozenges on POST.&#xD;
      There are currently no known studies that look at the efficacy of zinc in the prevention of&#xD;
      POST. The investigators will use custom compounded lozenges from a local pharmacy with 40 mg&#xD;
      of elemental zinc (equivalent to 174 mg of zinc sulfate) per lozenge, which is the tolerable&#xD;
      upper intake level for zinc in adults as defined by the US department of Food and Nutrition&#xD;
      Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The possible knowledge gained from this study for POST syndrome can be extended to people&#xD;
      undergoing surgeries requiring endotracheal intubation in the future.&#xD;
