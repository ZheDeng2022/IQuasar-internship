  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each subject will be allocated to 2 periods of 3 months of once daily dosing with either&#xD;
      liraglutide (1.2 mg) or placebo treatment (in random sequence) as add on to usual intensive&#xD;
      insulin treatment. Wash-out period between treatments will be 1 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial can be divided into the following periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment period 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Washout period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment period 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow up Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mixed Meal Tolerance Test (MMTT) enriched with paracetamol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning and end of each period a MMTT (Fortimel complete) enriched with paracetamol&#xD;
      will be performed to assess the remaining beta-cell function via obtained maximal plasma&#xD;
      C-peptide levels as well as the gastric emptying.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental / Hypoglycaemic clamp :&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of each period (Visit 8, 15) a hypoglycaemic clamp will be performed. After the&#xD;
      subject completed the MMTT on day 1, the subject will stay in the clinical unit to prepare&#xD;
      for the hypoglycaemic clamp with an variable insulin infusion intravenously in order to&#xD;
      obtain a steady state of a plasma glucose (PG) level of 5.5 mmol/L overnight until&#xD;
      approximately 08:00. At 05:00 hours 10%-[6,6-2H2] glucose solution will be given i.v. as a&#xD;
      primed (9.6mg/kg/min) for one minute and a constant (0.08 mg/kg/min) infusion until the last&#xD;
      blood sampling of the plateau 4.0 mmol/L will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 08:00 hours in the morning at day 2, insulin infusion will be increased to 1.5 mU/kg/min&#xD;
      for each subject and the PG will be kept at a plateau of 5.5 mmol/L by a controlled variable&#xD;
      intravenous infusion of glucose (10% glucose enriched with 4mg [6,6-2H2] glucose /ml) for one&#xD;
      hour. Afterwards, PG is allowed to fall to a plateau of 3.5 mmol/L, then to a nadir of 2.5&#xD;
      mmol/L, then to a blood glucose of 4.0 mmol/L and finally back to a level of 5.5 mmol/L for&#xD;
      safety reasons. Blood sampling for measurement of [6,6-2H2] glucose, glucagon, insulin,&#xD;
      counterregulatory hormones, lactate, free fatty acids, glycerol, vital signs, hypoglycaemic&#xD;
      symptoms questionnaire and hypoglycaemic awareness will be performed at each PG plateau.&#xD;
