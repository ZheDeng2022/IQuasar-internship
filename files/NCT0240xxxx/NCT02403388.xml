  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Avoidable care associated incidents are relatively frequent in primary care. In France for&#xD;
      example, avoidable incidents rate is estimated to 22/1000 medical acts from general&#xD;
      practitioners. Patient safety is now a growing issue in primary care. One tool to increase&#xD;
      patient safety is incident reporting and analysis. It could reduce some important&#xD;
      consequences for patients and could allow implementing substantial corrective actions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the PRisM study is to assess and compare the efficiency of a multifaceted risk&#xD;
      management program implemented in the french pluridisciplinary offices in primary care in&#xD;
      association with a centralized incident reporting system, versus a centralized incident&#xD;
      reporting system only.&#xD;
