  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical insufficiency (CI), responsible for 8% of preterm births (PB), is used to describe&#xD;
      painless cervical dilation leading to recurrent second-trimester pregnancy losses/births of&#xD;
      otherwise normal pregnancies. Structural weakness of cervical tissue was thought to cause or&#xD;
      contribute to these adverse outcomes. The term has also been applied to women with one or two&#xD;
      such losses/births or at risk for second-trimester pregnancy loss/birth. Cervical pessary and&#xD;
      cervical cerclage are both considered as preventive treatments in women at risk for PB. This&#xD;
      study aims to demonstrate that the cervical pessary could reduce the preterm birth rate&#xD;
      before 37 weeks of gestation in women with prior PB due to cervical insufficiency or in women&#xD;
      with prior PB and a short cervix in the current pregnancy.&#xD;

      Methods/Design: This is an open-label, pilot, multicentre, prospective, randomised controlled&#xD;
      trial (RCT). Enrolees are women with singleton pregnancies and previous PB based on CI&#xD;
      (primary intervention, &lt;16 weeks) or in case of previous PB and a short cervical length in&#xD;
      current pregnancy ≤ 25 mm (secondary intervention, &lt;24 weeks). Women are randomised (1:1)&#xD;
      either to cervical cerclage or pessary treatment. The primary outcome is the spontaneous&#xD;
      preterm birth rate before 34 weeks of gestation. The sample size was calculated, as a pilot&#xD;
      study, based on the estimated population that we will be able to recruit during the duration&#xD;
      of the trial: 60 women, 30 for each group (cervical cerclage and cervical pessary group) to&#xD;
      observe, at least a reduction in the PB rate &lt; 34 weeks from 34% to 27% in the pessary group,&#xD;
      as does cerclage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: The outcome of this study will show the effectiveness of a cervical cerclage and&#xD;
      of a cervical pessary in this group of patients.&#xD;

    <description>The Arabin cervical pessary, which is CE-certified for preventing spontaneous preterm birth (CE 0482 / EN ISO 13485: 2003 annex III of the council directive 93/42 EEC). It is a vaginal device which is used to treat pregnant women for preventing spontaneous preterm birth. This device can be easily placed around the uterine cervix without pain.</description>
