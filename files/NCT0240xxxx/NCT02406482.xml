      This study will examine the efficacy of a combined HIV and microfinance intervention to&#xD;
      reduce biologically confirmed sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and new incidence of&#xD;
      HIV and HCV, as well as reported sexual and drug risk behaviors among 520 women who have&#xD;
      injected drugs in the past year and who engage in sex trading in Temirtau and Pavlodar,&#xD;
      Kazakhstan. The proposed study builds on findings from an R34 by the investigative team&#xD;
      testing a combination HIV prevention and microfinance intervention. Building on successful&#xD;
      protocols and significant results, we will randomly assign 520 women who inject drugs and&#xD;
      engage in sex trading from Temirtau and Pavlodar, Kazakhstan to either (1) a 4 session HIV&#xD;
      prevention intervention combined with a 6 session financial literacy intervention, enrollment&#xD;
      in an existing vocational training program and receipt of matched savings (HIVRR+MF); or to&#xD;
      the 4 session HIV prevention intervention alone. The HIVRR intervention is guided by social&#xD;
      cognitive theory. The HIVRR+MF intervention integrates asset theory with social cognitive&#xD;
      theory. The MF includes: 1) financial literacy; 2) vocational training; and 3) micro-savings&#xD;
      to support transition to a more permanent employment status. We hypothesize that increasing&#xD;
      financial literacy, enhancing vocational skills required to fill marketable positions in the&#xD;
      local economy, and beginning a personal savings program, combined with HIV risk reduction,&#xD;
      will lead to significant reductions in study outcomes compared to an HIVRR intervention&#xD;
      without a microfinance intervention.&#xD;

      1. STUDY PURPOSE AND RATIONALE. This study is a 2-arm randomized control clinical trial&#xD;
           (RCT), Project Ascension, that will evaluate the efficacy of a combined 4-session HIV&#xD;
           risk reduction and microfinance intervention (including 6 sessions of financial literacy&#xD;
           skills; referral to a 36 session vocational training; and concurrent weekly matched&#xD;
           savings from the research team) (HIVRR+MF) to reduce new HIV/STI infections and sexual&#xD;
           and drug risk among women who inject drugs and trade sex in Temirtau and Pavlodar,&#xD;
           Kazakhstan. The primary outcomes are to decrease new STIs, including HIV and HCV,&#xD;
           proportion of unprotected sexual acts and proportion of income from sex work. Secondary&#xD;
           outcomes include examining mediating and moderating factors, the examine women's&#xD;
           experience of the intervention and cost effectiveness of the addition of MF over HIVRR&#xD;
           alone on primary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To evaluate the impact of the HIVRR+MF intervention we will use two sources of data: (1)&#xD;
           individual level biological testing data for syphilis, gonorrhea, trichomonas, HIV and&#xD;
           HCV collected from 520 participants, randomly assigned to either the treatment arm or&#xD;
           control arm at baseline, 6-months post-intervention, and 12 months post-intervention;&#xD;
           and (2) self-reported data collected from participants at baseline, 3 months-, 6&#xD;
           months-, and 12 months post-intervention. The same outcomes and variables will be&#xD;
           collected at each time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We are also currently seeking approval for this study from the IRB at the Kazakh School&#xD;
           of Public Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. STUDY DESIGN AND STATISTICAL PROCEDURES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This RCT will be conducted with 520 FSW-PWID recruited from 2 NGOs, one each in Temirtau and&#xD;
      Pavlodar, Kazakhstan. Collaborating NGOs are You are Not Alone, in Pavlodar and the&#xD;
      Association of People Living with HIV in Temirtau. They provide the full spectrum of services&#xD;
      for people affected by STIs and HIV, including FSW-PWID in each city. Women will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to either a (1) HIVRR plus Microfinance (HIVRR+MF) or (2) HIVRR alone control&#xD;
      condition. We will compare two active conditions offering the HIV risk reduction intervention&#xD;
      (HIVRR) to both intervention arms. This design will allow us to examine how the addition of&#xD;
      the MF to HIVRR might lead to superior outcomes compared to receiving HIVRR alone. HIVRR&#xD;
      intervention and the financial literacy will be delivered by research staff and vocational&#xD;
      training will be delivered by field site staff. In month 6, recruitment will begin. We will&#xD;
      enroll an average of 22 women per cohort per site (44 total every 2.5 months) and complete&#xD;
      enrollment by month 35. Self-reported data on behavioral outcomes will be collected via audio&#xD;
      computer-assisted self-interview (ACASI) and assessed at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months&#xD;
      post-intervention. We will implement the same survey at each time point. Primary outcomes&#xD;
      will be measured via biological assay for Neisseria gonorrhea, Trichomoniasis, Syphilis,&#xD;
      Chlamydia and Mycoplasma, as well as for HIV and HCV. Biological outcomes are assessed at&#xD;
      baseline, 6 and 12 months post-intervention. Follow up assessments will start in month 15 and&#xD;
      the final 12 month follow up will be completed in month 51. For Aim 4, we will conduct a&#xD;
      qualitative study on women's experience with each of the HIVRR+MF components, and the unique&#xD;
      impact of study conditions on structural factors associated with risk among FSW-PWID. For Aim&#xD;
      5, we will collect cost data related to each intervention component every 6 months from&#xD;
      months 6-50. Data analyses will commence in year 5 followed by dissemination of findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative Study. To help open the &quot;black box&quot; of the delivery of HIVRR+ MF, the&#xD;
      investigators will conduct semi structured in-depth interviews at 3 points in time during&#xD;
      implementation of the HIVRR intervention. Following the HIVRR and financial literacy&#xD;
      components (4 weeks post-baseline), investigators will randomly select 2 participants from&#xD;
      each arm per cohort (total of N=48 women from 12 cohorts) to complete their first of 3&#xD;
      interviews. The next two interviews will be conducted at the end of the MF intervention and&#xD;
      again at the 12 month follow up for each participant. Questions will focus on participants'&#xD;
      perception of the intervention, their experience receiving the intervention components&#xD;
      (including reactions or interactions with family, friends, colleagues related to their&#xD;
      participation), their experience receiving the sessions, factors promoting the use of the&#xD;
      session information and skills and barriers impeding participation. Importantly, questions&#xD;
      will also focus on perceptions of how the intervention influenced participant safety,&#xD;
      including any policy involvement, stigma or discrimination, drug use before and during the&#xD;
      intervention, and savings and the potential access to matched savings. All interviews will be&#xD;
      audio taped, transcribed and translated to English.&#xD;

Sessions derive from three evidence-based interventions with demonstrated efficacy to reduce drug and sexual HIV-risk behaviors in vulnerable women. Content focuses on basic transmission risk; educating about the risks of alcohol and drug use and how sexual behavior increases HIV risk; male and female condom use; examining the context for sexual risk including male partner sexual risk behavior (e.g. multiple partners) and violence against women; reducing other sexual risks (e.g., mutual masturbation, correct use of lubricants).</description>
