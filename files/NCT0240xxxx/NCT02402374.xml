  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) gel was reported to have very good outcomes in the&#xD;
      treatment of foot ulcers in pilot studies and retrospective uncontrolled trials. Therefore, a&#xD;
      larger randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial will be useful to determine whether&#xD;
      platelet-rich plasma is safe and effective for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evaluate the safety and efficacy of RegenKit autologous PRP Gel for the treatment of diabetic&#xD;
      foot ulcer is a randomized, placebo controlled, blind-assessor study. One hundred and seventy&#xD;
      four patients will be treated, 87 patients receiving treatment arm and 87 patients receiving&#xD;
      placebo. The primary endpoint is to evaluate proportion of patients with complete wound&#xD;
      closure at week 16 when treated with autologous platelet rich plasma gel compared to the&#xD;
      proportion of control (saline gel) treated patients with complete wound closure at the same&#xD;
      time-point.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Ulcer should not be infected as determined by clinical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ulcer duration of 4 weeks or longer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ulcer area (length x width) of between 1.5 cm2 and 20 cm2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Full-thickness ulcer of Grade 1 or Grade 2 as per Wagner's classification system&#xD;

             opinion of Investigator, should have undergone appropriate structural consolidation&#xD;
             (the affected charcot fractures will have been fused together and should be&#xD;
             sufficiently stable to allow the patient to weight-bear)&#xD;
