  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most frequent complications in premature infants are neurological complications:&#xD;
      intracranial hemorrhages and white matter lesions. In Epipage 2 study the incidence of severe&#xD;
      intraventricular hemorrhages remains stable. Severe hemorrhages are associated with&#xD;
      neurological sequelae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study in humans and in animals shows the role of the complex formed by plasminogen&#xD;
      activator (t-PA) and its inhibitor (PAI-1) in the induction of vascular fragility via&#xD;
      stromelysin (MMP-3). FIBRINAT study in Rouen University Hospital showed a rate of complex&#xD;
      t-PA-PAI1 probably very high in preterm infants. An other factor maturation PDGF-C induced by&#xD;
      t-PA is associated with the vascular embrittlement. Among the few genetic factors associated&#xD;
      with cerebral palsy include 2 SNP of PAI-1 gene and one SNP in the gene of endothelial NO&#xD;
      synthase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that a high rate of the complex t-PA-PAI-1 in cord blood could be a high&#xD;
      risk of intracranial hemorrhage in preterm infants and provide predictive of their&#xD;
      occurrence. The rates of MMP-3, PDGF-C and PAI-1 free in cord blood, and the polymorphism of&#xD;
      PAI-1 gene and eNOS could separately or associated with the main criterion to identify&#xD;
      predictive of hemorrhages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to search a rate difference of the complex t-PA-PAI-1 in cord blood of&#xD;
      preterm infants (before 30 weeks of gestation) that would predict intracranial hemorrhage&#xD;
      coming in the first days of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate potential marker risk of high levels of MMP-3, PAI-1 free, and PDGF-CC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Search in both groups the presence of alleles -675G4 / G5 and 11053 (G / T) of the PAI-1&#xD;
           gene and -922 (A / G) of the eNOS gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
           120 preterm infants will be included before 30 weeks of gestation with precise inclusion&#xD;
           and exclusion criteria during a period of 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be divided into two groups according to whether they will or not showed&#xD;
      intracranial hemorrhage (detected by ultrasound J5-J7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The complex rate tPA-PAI-1, PAI-1 free, MMP-3 and PDGF-C will be measured. The comparison&#xD;
      between the two groups will be carried out using statistical tests. Comparison of the&#xD;
      presence of the alleles -675 4G and 11053T the PAI-1 gene or -922G eNOS gene between the two&#xD;
      groups will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The demonstration of this hypothesis would permit to identify children from birth in whom the&#xD;
      immediate implementation of preventive treatment of bleeding is desirable.&#xD;
