  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HF001 is a prospective observational study utilizing non-invasive medical devices that may be&#xD;
      able to discriminate changes in heart failure while acutely decompensated patients undergo&#xD;
      routine interventional therapies in a hospital setting. Subjects will be monitored using&#xD;
      CVInsight™ [CVI] via a finger and/or forehead sensor, while performing an isometric handgrip&#xD;
      stress test (IHGST). Changes in the CVI signal will be analyzed and correlated to standard&#xD;
      assessments of heart failure including pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) pressures, blood&#xD;
      pressure (BP), patient symptoms, and physical exam findings. The results of this study will&#xD;
      be used to develop a powered study to determine if a new configuration of non-invasive&#xD;
      monitoring devices can be used to monitor heart failure status more sensitively than current&#xD;
      non-invasive techniques.&#xD;
