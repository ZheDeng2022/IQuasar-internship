  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, Phase II study of crenolanib as maintenance in AML patients with FLT3&#xD;
      mutations who have achieved complete remission (CR) after allogeneic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation. Oral crenolanib will be administered daily post-transplant for up to two&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are two patient subgroups: 1) those who were in complete remission (CR) at the time of&#xD;
      transplant, and 2) those who were not in complete remission (NCR) at the time of transplant.&#xD;
      Start of crenolanib therapy at 100 mg TID is intended at the earliest time no sooner than 30&#xD;
      days but no later than 90 days after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Patients may take&#xD;
      crenolanib continuously for up to 728 days or until one of the criteria for study&#xD;
      discontinuation is fulfilled.&#xD;
