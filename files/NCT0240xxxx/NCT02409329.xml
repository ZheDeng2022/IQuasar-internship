  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates a mobile phone-delivered intervention, called REACH (Rapid&#xD;
      Education/Encouragement And Communications for Health), in supporting adults with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes in their self-management relative to a control group. The goal of this study is to&#xD;
      determine if individually tailored content (based on the Information-Motivation-Behavioral&#xD;
      Skills Model) delivered to the participant via text messages can improve the participant's&#xD;
      glycemic control and adherence to diabetes medications. We will test whether our intervention&#xD;
      improves adherence-related information, motivation, and behavioral skills and whether&#xD;
      improving these mechanisms drives improvements in adherence and, in turn, glycemic control.&#xD;

          <description>Participants will receive REACH text messages (individual-focused text messaging tailored to user's individual barriers to adherence and targeted to address other self-care behaviors) for 12 months.&#xD;
All participants will also receive text messages advising how to access their study A1c test results, receive quarterly newsletters on healthy living with diabetes, and have access to a Helpline for study- and diabetes medication-related questions.&#xD;
REACH: The intervention consists of daily text messaging tailored to user's individual barriers to medication adherence, text messages assessing user's adherence with feedback on progress, plus text messaging targeting other self-care behaviors.&#xD;
Helpline and A1c results: Participants complete study assessments, receive text messages advising how to access study A1c results, receive quarterly newsletters on healthy living with diabetes, and have access to a helpline for study- or diabetes medication-related questions.</description>
