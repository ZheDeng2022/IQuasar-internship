      This will be a phase II trial of the combination of sunitinib and nivolumab in patients with&#xD;
      advanced, measurable, metastatic melanoma who harbor mutations in the KIT gene in their&#xD;
      tumors. It is a multi-center trial using the FDA-approved doses of both sunitinib and&#xD;
      nivolumab. Sunitinib will be provided by Pfizer. Endpoint is RECIST response rate and PFS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Curtin and Bastian in 2006 first described KIT mutations in melanoma. Although uncommon in&#xD;
      non-acral cutaneous melanoma, these mutations are frequent in mucosal and acral melanomas.&#xD;
      The KIT mutations in melanoma are similar to the KIT mutations in gastrointestinal intestinal&#xD;
      stromal sarcomas (GIST) and these are believed to be driver mutations. In melanomas these&#xD;
      mutations occur in an exclusive pattern in tumors without NRAS, BRAF, or GNAQ mutations.&#xD;
      There is evidence that stage four melanoma patients with KIT mutations have a worse prognosis&#xD;
      than other patients with similar stage and primary site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both imatinib and sunitinib are FDA approved for treatment of patients with GIST; these and&#xD;
      other oral tyrosine kinase KIT inhibitors have been studied in melanoma patients with KIT&#xD;
      mutations. Imatinib is the best studied with objective responses in 20% of patients in a&#xD;
      multicenter trial, considerably lower than the efficacy seen in GIST. Sunitinib has the&#xD;
      theoretical advantage of anti-angiogenic activity as well as anti -KIT activity and&#xD;
      demonstrated objective responses in three of four patients in a small trial sponsored by&#xD;
      Pfizer.(see citation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunotherapy has a major role in the treatment of metastatic melanoma, with the approval and&#xD;
      use of both Interleukin-2 and ipilimumab because of the ability of immunotherapy to produce&#xD;
      durable responses and prolonged survival in a minority, but a significant number, of patients&#xD;
      . Both sunitinib and ipilimumab have intestinal perforation as an unusual but very&#xD;
      significant toxicity, which argues against using those two agents in combination. The&#xD;
      anti-PD-1 antibody Nivolumab, however, is an immunologic agent that yields rapid and durable&#xD;
      responses in melanoma with less colitis and less risk of intestinal perforation than&#xD;
      ipilimumab. Nivolumab was FDA approved in December 2014 and NCCN guidelines include it as a&#xD;
      first-line option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combining KIT receptor inhibition with sunitinib with immunotherapy with Nivolumab is an&#xD;
      attractive investigational approach as the combination should produce complementary and&#xD;
      perhaps synergistic efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asim et al reported at ASCO in June 2014 a phase one study of sunitinib and nivolumab for the&#xD;
      treatment of metastatic renal cell cancer. Sunitinib (50 mg/day x 4 week, off 2 weeks and&#xD;
      nivolumab at 2mg/kg or 5mg/kg q 3 weeks was administered to 33 patients. No dose-limiting&#xD;
      toxicities were seen but grade 3-4 AEs were seen in 24 of 33 patients. The most common AEs&#xD;
      were elevated ALT (18%), hypertension (15%) and hyponatremia (15%). Objective responses sere&#xD;
      seen in 52% (17/33) indicating an &quot;encouraging activity and a manageable safety profile&quot; in&#xD;
      patients with renal cell cancer. The Nivolumab dose of 5mg/kg Q 3 weeks (1.67mg/kg/week) on&#xD;
      that study is slightly above the usual dose of 3mg/kg Q 2 weeks (1.5mg/kg/week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label multi-center phase 2 study of sunitinib and Nivolumab in combination in&#xD;
      patients with KIT mutated metastatic melanoma. Study to begin after FDA approval of nivolumab&#xD;
      Total number of study subjects will be approximately 12-18 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To describe the preliminary clinical efficacy of sunitinib when given in combination&#xD;
           with nivolumab to patients with KIT-mutated melanoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To describe the immunologic effects of sunitinib when administered in combination with&#xD;
           Nivolumab&#xD;
&#xD;
      Co-primary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Objective response using RECIST 1.1 immune modified response criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Progression-free survival using immune-modified response criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Toxicities using CTAE criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Changes in peripheral blood total lymphocyte counts and T and B cell count&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Overall survival The trial is sponsored by the California Pacific Medical Center&#xD;
           Research Institute and the sunitinib will be provided by Pfizer. Commercial sources will&#xD;
           be used for the nivolumab, whose use is in accord with NCCN guidelines.&#xD;
