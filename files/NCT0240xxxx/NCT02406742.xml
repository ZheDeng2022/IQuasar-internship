      Safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of CC-122 alone and in combination with&#xD;
      ibrutinib and obinuzutumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CC-122 has multiple activities, including immune modulation of several immune cell subsets&#xD;
      and antiproliferative activity in CLL. CC-122 has also been shown to have a tolerable safety&#xD;
      profile with some preliminary signs of efficacy with early human experience.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this Phase 1/2 Study are to determine the safety of single agent&#xD;
      CC-122 and the safety, tolerability, and RP2D of CC-122 when administered in combination with&#xD;
      ibrutinib and in combination with obinutuzumab to subjects with CLL/SLL. The secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to evaluate the PK profiles of subjects administered CC-122 in combination&#xD;
      with ibrutinib and in combination with obinutuzumab, to determine ibrutinib concentrations&#xD;
      when given alone and in combination with CC-122 and to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of&#xD;
      CC-122 at selected dose levels/regimens.&#xD;

             - Agree to abstain from donating blood while taking IP and following discontinuation&#xD;
             of IP.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Agree not to share IP with another person.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Other than the subject, FCBP and males should not handle the IP or touch the capsules,&#xD;
             unless gloves are worn.&#xD;

          2. Subject must be either resistant to or intolerant of (ie., treatment failures) the&#xD;
             last BCR PI and/or venetoclax. Resistant is defined as relapsed or refractory per&#xD;
&#xD;
        IWCLL2008:&#xD;
&#xD;
        i. Relapse is defined as a patient who has previously achieved a CR or PR, but after a&#xD;
        period of 6 or more months, demonstrates evidence of disease progression. ii. Refractory is&#xD;
        defined as failing to achieve a CR or PR, or disease progression within 6 months after&#xD;
        initiation of treatment with an approved BTK or PI3K inhibitor (eg, ibrutinib, idelalisib)&#xD;
        or venetoclax. iii. Intolerance is defined as the inability to continue treatment with a&#xD;
        BCR PI or venetoclax due to toxicities or due to development of a contraindication that&#xD;
        makes the subject ineligible to receive further treatment with a BCR PI or venetoclax.&#xD;

             should be referred to a specialist if they are carriers before treatment starts (see&#xD;
             PI or SmPC). Subjects who are positive for anti-HBc and/or anti-HBs but negative for&#xD;
             HBsAg and HBV DNA may be treated after consultation with a hepatologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Any peripheral neuropathy ≥ NCI CTCAE Grade 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Use of systemic corticosteroids in doses greater than prednisone equivalent to 20&#xD;
             mg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Medicines with high probability to cause QT prolongation or torsades de pointes.&#xD;
             Subjects on chronic medications in this category may enroll after discussion with the&#xD;
             medical monitor if changing these medications are not in the best medical interest of&#xD;
             the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. History of hypersensitivity to IMiDs® (lenalidomide, pomalidomide, thalidomide).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac diseases, including any of&#xD;
             the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 45% as determined by MUGA scan or&#xD;
                  echocardiogram (ECHO).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Complete left bundle branch, or bifasicular, block.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Congenital long QT syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Persistent or uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias or atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. QTcF &gt; 470 msec on Screening ECG (mean of triplicate recordings).&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Unstable angina pectoris or myocardial infarction ≤ 6 months prior to starting CC&#xD;
                  122.&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Uncontrolled congestive heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Troponin-T value &gt;0.4 ng/mL or BNP &gt;300 pg/mL. Subjects with baseline troponin-T&#xD;
                  &gt;ULN or BNP &gt;100 pg/mL are eligible but must have cardiologist evaluation prior&#xD;
                  to enrollment in the trial for baseline assessment and optimization of&#xD;
                  cardioprotective therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, investigational anticancer therapy or major surgery within&#xD;
             28 days of Day 1 dosing with the following exceptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. Arm A: A minimum 5-day washout after discontinuation of ibrutinib therapy (or other&#xD;
             BTK inhibitors) is required; only those subjects without rapid disease progression&#xD;
             during the 5-day washout will be allowed to enroll into Arm A.&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. Rapid disease progression is defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. For subjects with measurable nodal disease, the increase in the sum of diameters of the&#xD;
        largest lymph nodes (up to 3 nodes) exceeds&#xD;
&#xD;
        1 cm per day OR the diameter of the largest lymph node exceeds 5 cm during the 5 day wash&#xD;
        out. 2. For subjects with lymphocytosis, the increase in the ALC exceeds 2x109/L per day OR&#xD;
        the ALC exceeds 100,000 x109/L during the 5-day wash out; b. Arm C: No minimum washout is&#xD;
        required after discontinuation of ibrutinib (or other BTK inhibitors) c. Approved PI3&#xD;
        kinase inhibitors: Subjects may start study treatment within 3 days of discontinuation of&#xD;
        approved PI3 kinase inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        14. Persistent diarrhea or malabsorption ≥ NCI CTCAE Grade 2, despite medical management&#xD;
        15. Active disease transformation (ie, Richter's Syndrome); subjects with Richter's&#xD;
        Syndrome that has resolved &gt; 2 years from signing the ICD are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        16. Known acute or chronic pancreatitis 17. Pregnant or lactating females&#xD;
&#xD;
        Arm B only (CC-122 in combination with ibrutinib):&#xD;
&#xD;
        18. Prior treatment with a BTK inhibitor 19. Presence of transfusion-dependent&#xD;
        thrombocytopenia or a history of bleeding disorders or clinical conditions (eg,&#xD;
        gastrointestinal bleeding or constitutional disorders) that may increase risk of&#xD;
        life-threatening bleeding when thrombocytopenic 20. History of stroke or intracranial&#xD;
        hemorrhage within 6 months prior to signing the ICD 21. Medications that are strong&#xD;
        inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4/5 (eg, itraconazole, ketoconazole, clarithromycin,&#xD;
        ritonavir, phenytoin, pentobarbital, and rifampin) should be changed; subjects who cannot&#xD;
        change these medications must be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        22. Use of concomitant anticoagulation with warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists is&#xD;
        prohibited, as is treatment with these agents in the 7 days prior to signing the ICD. The&#xD;
        use of other anticoagulants (eg, heparins) and anti-platelet agents is allowed per&#xD;
        investigator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Arm C only (CC-122 in combination with obinutuzumab):&#xD;
&#xD;
        23. Hypersensitivity to obinutuzumab&#xD;
