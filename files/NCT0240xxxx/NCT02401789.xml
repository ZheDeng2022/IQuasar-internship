      The objective of the present study is to evaluate if loss of multiple adjacent teeth will&#xD;
      cause proportionally greater tissue diminution than the loss of single teeth the possibility&#xD;
      of counteracting unfavourable ridge modeling after multiple tooth extractions by placing&#xD;
      implants in the fresh extraction sites soft tissue alterations at implants and adjacent teeth&#xD;

      The study will be designed as a prospective, randomized, controlled multicenter study&#xD;
      evaluating the potential of endosseous implants (OsseospeedTM,EV, Astra Tech System,&#xD;
      DentsplyTM, Mölndal, Sweden) placed in fresh extraction sockets to preserve the ridge&#xD;
      dimensions at the edentulous site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three centers will be involved in the study namely, (i) Department of Periodontology,&#xD;
      University of Padova, Italy, (ii) Institute Franci, Padova, Italy, (iii) Department of&#xD;
      Periodontology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the start of the study the human review board at the treatment centers must approve&#xD;
      the study protocol as well as the informed consent forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group assignment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the removal of the target teeth, the subject (site) will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      one of 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test group 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implants (OsseospeedTM,EV Astra Tech System, DentsplyTM, Mölndal) will be used. Preparation&#xD;
      of the osteotomy for the implant sites will include the use of drills. A guide drill will&#xD;
      establish the buccal-palatal/lingual and mesio-distal position of the implants. The final&#xD;
      osteotomy preparation will be done by a single pass of an appropriate drill. Using a&#xD;
      handpiece at 20 rpms and 50 Ncm of torque the implant will be placed. Primary stability must&#xD;
      be obtained. Furthermore, the operator must ensure that a blood clot properly fills the void&#xD;
      in the fresh extraction sockets. A MucograftTM membrane (Geistlich Pharma, Wolhusen,&#xD;
      Switzerland) will be adapted to the entrance of the hard tissue defects. Sutures will be&#xD;
      placed to secure the position of the membrane.The treatment should follow the guidelines&#xD;
      described in the Astra Tech Manuals 'Surgical Procedures' and 'Cement-or screw- retained&#xD;
      restorations -Clinical and laboratory procedures'. To avoid excessive loading of the implant&#xD;
      during the healing period, the patient is not allowed to use any implant supported temporary&#xD;
      restorations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 4 months of healing abutments will be installed (Healing AbutmentTM or Healing Abutment&#xD;
      ZebraTM). The soft tissue will be adapted and sutured back for a tight seal around the&#xD;
      abutment. The restorative procedure will commence and the prosthetic device inserted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No material will be placed in the socket. A MucograftTM membrane (Geistlich Pharma, Wolhusen,&#xD;
      Switzerland) will be adapted to the entrance of the hard tissue defects. Sutures will be&#xD;
      placed to secure the position of the membrane. After 4 months of healing implant installation&#xD;
      will take place (see above) and after another 3 months the prosthetic rehabilitation will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up period During a 3 year follow-up period the subjects of the test and control groups&#xD;
      will be recalled every 6 months for professional tooth cleaning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stone models:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An impression of the target sites using a polyphosphate-based impression material will be&#xD;
      taken prior to tooth extraction and a stone model of the extraction site and adjacent teeth&#xD;
      will be produced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New impressions and stone models will be produced one week following tooth extraction and&#xD;
      after 4 months of healing and after 1,2 and 3 years of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The supra-gingival portion of the teeth in (a duplicate of) the stone model (see above) to be&#xD;
      extracted will be carefully removed. The center of the future &quot;extraction sites&quot; will be&#xD;
      identified. A rigid acrylic splint - a guide including a quartz marker (Dual Scan MarkerTM (&#xD;
      Materialize Dental NV, Leuven, Belgium)- will be produced. This guide will be used for the&#xD;
      CBCT scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after a careful flapless extraction of the teeth, (i) a cone beam computerized&#xD;
      tomographic (CBCT) examination of the edentulous sites will be performed. The radiographic&#xD;
      examination will be performed with the Planmeca ProMax3D unit (Planmeca Oy, Helsinky,&#xD;
      Finland). The images will be acquired by means of the Planmeca Romexis software and processed&#xD;
      by a computer. Acquisition will be performed for 24s (volumetric dimension of 8 x 8 cm) with&#xD;
      the Planmeca tomography acquisition protocol: voxel size: 0.15 mm; Grey scale: 12 bits; focal&#xD;
      spot: 0.5x0,5 mm; image detector: amorphous silicon flat panel; image acquisition: single&#xD;
      270° rotation. The images will be generated in DICOM format and the files of each patient&#xD;
      will be saved and analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) a series of standard intraoral radiographs, using the paralleling technique will be&#xD;
      obtained from each experimental socket and inter-dental bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new set of CBCT scans will be obtained after 4 months of healing following tooth extraction&#xD;
      and after 3 year. New intraoral radiographs will be obtained prior to and after tooth&#xD;
      extraction, after 4 months of healing (before and after implant placement) and after 1, 2 and&#xD;
      3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recordings:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the stone models (mm and mm2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Maximum bucco-lingual width (mm) at midline of each extraction socket (see Schropp et&#xD;
           al. 2003)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The location of the crest -in relation to defined reference points at the adjacent&#xD;
           teeth- (i) next to adjacent teeth (mm) , (ii) at the center of each extraction socket&#xD;
           (mm and mm2 ) and (iii) at the position of the &quot;inter-implant/tooth papillae&quot;(mm) In the&#xD;
           CBCT scans measurements will be made at (i) the center of each extraction socket, (ii)&#xD;
           between the sockets (&quot;inter-dental septum&quot;) (iii) at the septum next to adjacent teeth&#xD;
           Intraoral radiographs The changes in the crestal bone levels will be assessed and by&#xD;
           measuring the distance (MBL) from a defined reference point on the implant (adjacent&#xD;
           tooth surface) to the most coronal bone-to implant contact on the mesial and distal&#xD;
           aspect of the implant/tooth. In the radiographs the MBL distance will be recorded to the&#xD;
           nearest 0.1 mm using a magnifying (X7) lens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical examination This examinations will be performed at the visit of placement of the&#xD;
      permanent restoration and after 1,2, and 3 years and include the following; Soft tissue&#xD;
      inflammation: The condition of the mucosa/gingiva around all implants and adjacent teeth will&#xD;
      be assessed at 4 surfaces (mesial, distal, buccal, palatal) using a periodontal probe.&#xD;
      Inflammation in the soft tissue will be considered present when a site bleeds on gentle&#xD;
      probing (BoP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Papilla fill: The degree of soft tissue fill in the inter-implant and tooth-implant sites&#xD;
      will be determined according to the criteria of the Papilla Index System (scores 0 - 4)&#xD;
      described by Jemt (1997).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Soft tissue margin: The distance between the margin of the permanent restoration and the most&#xD;
      apical level of the soft tissue margin will be measured at the buccal aspect of the implants&#xD;
      as well as a corresponding distance at neighboring teeth. This so called &quot;mucosal zenith&quot;&#xD;
      value will be measured with a periodontal probe and expressed in mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods Clinical outcome variables: Main outcome variable will be the alteration&#xD;
      following tooth extraction of horizontal and vertical dimensions of the edentulous ridge&#xD;
      including both soft and hard tissues. Secondary outcome variables will be implant survival at&#xD;
      1, 2, 3 years, radiographic bone level and soft tissue change at implants/adjacent teeth and&#xD;
      extraction defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation based on the detection of a difference of 3 mm in mean crest width&#xD;
      difference between treatment groups, assuming a standard deviation of 3.0 mm (Schropp et al&#xD;
      2003), and with an alpha error defined to 0.05 and beta error to 0.20 (power 80%), revealed&#xD;
      that 17 subjects in each treatment group will be required. Considering a 10% drop out, a&#xD;
      total of 40 patients/teeth must be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For analysis of clinical efficacy, data from two slightly different analysis populations will&#xD;
      be used, i.e. the Per Protocol (PP) and the All Patients Treated (APT) populations. The&#xD;
      primary objective is to determine the alterations in the buccal and palatal aspects of the&#xD;
      size of the defect dimensions at implant placement and after healing. Results will be&#xD;
      presented by appropriate descriptive and inferential statistics. Continuous variables will be&#xD;
      presented by means of number of observations (N), minimum (min), median, maximum (max), mean&#xD;
      and standard deviation (std). Discrete variables will be presented by frequency and&#xD;
      percentage.&#xD;
