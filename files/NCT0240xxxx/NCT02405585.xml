    <textblock>
      Unfortunately, despite the best clinical efforts and breakthroughs in biotechnology, most&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer continue to die from the rapid progression of their&#xD;
      disease. One primary reason for this is that the disease is typically without symptoms until&#xD;
      significant local and/or distant spread has occurred and is often beyond the chance for cure&#xD;
      at the time of the diagnosis. The lack of any treatment to substantially increase long term&#xD;
      survival rates is reflected by the poor outcomes associated with this disease, specifically&#xD;
      time to disease progression and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, another important part of the body is now being looked at as a target for therapy&#xD;
      against this disease - the immune system. Scientists have clearly shown that pancreatic tumor&#xD;
      cells produce a number of defective proteins, or express normal proteins in highly&#xD;
      uncharacteristic ways, as part of this cancer. In some cancers, these abnormalities can cause&#xD;
      an immune response to the cancer cells much in the way one responds to infected tissue. In&#xD;
      progressive cancers however, the immune system fails to effectively identify or respond to&#xD;
      these abnormalities and the cancer cells are not attacked or destroyed for reasons not yet&#xD;
      fully understood. This clinical trial proposes a new way to stimulate the immune system to&#xD;
      recognize pancreatic cancer cells and to stimulate an immune response that destroys or blocks&#xD;
      the growth of the cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This new method of treatment helps the immune system of pancreatic cancer patients to&#xD;
      &quot;identify&quot; the cancerous tissue so that it can be eliminated from the body. As an example,&#xD;
      patients with certain diseases may require an organ transplant to replace a damaged kidney or&#xD;
      heart. After receiving their transplant, these patients receive special drugs because they&#xD;
      are at great danger of having an immune response that destroys or &quot;rejects&quot; the transplanted&#xD;
      organ. This &quot;rejection&quot; occurs when their immune system responds to differences between the&#xD;
      cells of the transplanted organ and their own immune system by attacking the foreign tissue&#xD;
      in the same way as it would attack infected tissue. When the differences between foreign&#xD;
      tissues and the patient's body are even larger, as with the differences between organs from&#xD;
      different species, the rejection is very rapid, highly destructive, and the immunity it&#xD;
      generates is longlasting. This is called hyperacute rejection and the medicine used to&#xD;
      immunize patients in this protocol tries to harness this response to teach a patient's immune&#xD;
      system to fight their pancreatic cancer just as the body would learn to reject a transplanted&#xD;
      organ from an animal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To do this, Algenpantucel-L immunotherapy contains human pancreatic cancer cells that contain&#xD;
      a mouse gene that marks the cancer cells as foreign to patient's immune systems. The immune&#xD;
      system therefore attacks these cancer cells just as they would attack any truly foreign&#xD;
      tissue, destroying as much as it can. Additionally, the immune system is stimulated to&#xD;
      identify differences (aside from the mouse gene) between these cancer cells and normal human&#xD;
      tissue as foreign. This &quot;education&quot; of the immune system helps treat the patient because&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer cells already present in a treated patient are believed to show some of the&#xD;
      same differences from normal tissue as the modified pancreatic cancer cells in the product.&#xD;
      Due to these similarities, the immune system, once &quot;educated&quot; by the Algenpantucel-L&#xD;
      immunotherapy, identifies the patient's cancer as foreign and attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, external beam radiation has been part of the treatment of pancreatic cancer,&#xD;
      both before and after surgical resection. Recent breakthroughs in technology now allow for&#xD;
      more intensive doses of radiation to be delivered to the body with greater precision. These&#xD;
      newer, more precise radiation treatments, called stereotactic body radiation, deliver more&#xD;
      intensive radiation to a locally advanced tumor and are now being employed in the treatment&#xD;
      of pancreatic cancer. Stereotactic body radiation may increase the chances that surgery will&#xD;
      successfully remove a pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this experimental study, all patients will be given a strong combination of antitumor&#xD;
      chemotherapy while receiving injections of an immunotherapy drug consisting of two types of&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer cells that have been modified to make them more easily recognized and&#xD;
      attacked by the immune system. The investigators propose to test this new treatment paradigm&#xD;
      along with stereotactic body radiation in patients with borderline resectable pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer to demonstrate that treatment with this combination of therapies increases the time&#xD;
      until the tumor progresses as well as overall survival.&#xD;

      This protocol attempts to treat pancreatic cancer using a naturally occurring barrier to&#xD;
      xenotransplantation in humans to increase the efficacy of immunizing subjects against their&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer. In this protocol, the transfer of the murine&#xD;
      alpha(1,3)galactosyltransferase [alpha(1,3)GT] gene to immunotherapy component cells results&#xD;
      in the cell surface expression of alpha(1,3)galactosyl-epitopes (alpha gal) epitopes on&#xD;
      membrane glycoproteins and glycolipids. These epitopes are the major target of the hyperacute&#xD;
      rejection response. This response occurs when organs are transplanted from lower animal donor&#xD;
      species into primates and results in rapid destruction of transplanted tissue and an&#xD;
      augmented response against transplant antigens, including antigens not related to the alpha&#xD;
      gal epitopes. Human hosts have pre-existing anti-alpha-gal antibodies that are thought to&#xD;
      result from chronic immunological stimulation due to exposure to alpha-gal epitopes that are&#xD;
      naturally expressed on normal gut flora and these antibodies may comprise up to 1% of serum&#xD;
      IgG. Opsonization and lysis of the immunotherapy component cells mediated by this antibody is&#xD;
      believed to increase the efficiency of antigen processing by targeting vaccine components to&#xD;
      antigen presenting cells via the Fc gamma receptor.&#xD;

                  without encasement of the nearby arteries, or short-segment venous occlusion&#xD;
                  resulting from either tumor thrombus or encasement but with suitable vessel&#xD;
                  proximal and distal to the area of vessel involvement, allowing for safe&#xD;
                  resection and reconstruction&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Gastroduodenal artery encasement up to the hepatic artery with either short&#xD;

&#xD;
               4. Nodal status: Involvement of lymph nodes beyond the field of resection should be&#xD;
                  considered unresectable due to distant spread and therefore not eligible for this&#xD;
