    <textblock>
      The Center for Bariatric Surgery is interested in conducting a pharmacokinetic study of&#xD;
      apixaban (an oral anticoagulant with FDA approval for use of venous thrombo embolism (VTE)&#xD;
      prophylaxis and treatment) in the obese adult population to determine if bariatric surgery&#xD;
      influences apixaban exposure. More interesting would be to see how the dose may need to&#xD;
      change pre- vs. post-bariatric surgery (this will be important for physicians as more and&#xD;
      more patients undergo this procedure worldwide and many may require anticoagulation in their&#xD;
      future healthcare).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physicians and surgeons are very interested in oral anticoagulants for this special patient&#xD;
      population. To date, there is no approved dosing for the obese patient (especially when&#xD;
      considering surgical intervention such as bariatric surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the durability or change in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of apixaban in&#xD;
      patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 kg/m2 or greater following one of two bariatric&#xD;
      surgical procedures (pre-operative versus post-operative vertical sleeve gastrectomy or&#xD;
      Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare/contrast the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of apixaban in bariatric&#xD;
           surgical patients who have undergone RYGB vs. VSG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine how the pharmacokinetics of the drug may differ when there is significant&#xD;
           post-operative surgical weight loss (&gt;40% estimated excess body weight) 12 to 18 months&#xD;
           following surgery versus those patients who have suboptimal weight loss following&#xD;
           bariatric surgery (&lt; 40% of estimated excess body weight).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is now the leading health problem of the 21st century. Weight reduction by&#xD;
      conservative methods including diet and exercise has had poor success rates. There has been a&#xD;
      substantial increase in the use of bariatric surgery to provide sustained weight loss and&#xD;
      thus a reduction in the medical comorbidities that are associated with obesity. However,&#xD;
      because these procedures may alter the anatomical and physiological aspects of the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal system, there is a possibility of altered pharmacokinetics to medications&#xD;
      particularly when taken orally. Furthermore, patients typically lose anywhere from 50 to 75%&#xD;
      of their estimated excess body mass approximately one to two years following surgery. This&#xD;
      successful therapeutic outcome of the surgery may be causing long term changes in the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics that are independent of any direct anatomical or physiologic changes induced&#xD;
      by the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physicians and surgeons are very interested in oral anticoagulants for this special patient&#xD;
      population. To date, there is no approved dosing for the obese patient (especially when&#xD;
      considering surgical intervention such as bariatric surgery). VTE is one of the top two&#xD;
      causes of morbidity and mortality in the bariatric surgical patient. In the ninth edition of&#xD;
      the Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis guideline published by the American&#xD;
      College of Chest Physicians (1), it is reported that virtually all bariatric surgical&#xD;
      patients have at least a moderate risk of VTE, with many patients at high risk. (2) The&#xD;
      approach to VTE prophylaxis used by most bariatric surgeons today is a combination of&#xD;
      non-invasive and pharmacologic techniques, including sequential compression devices,&#xD;
      anti-embolic stockings, anticoagulation, and early ambulation. Traditionally VTE prophylaxis&#xD;
      has been accomplished with subcutaneous injection however with the introduction of new oral&#xD;
      anticoagulant medications many practitioners are using these anticoagulants without&#xD;
      demonstration of effectiveness in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Johns Hopkins Center for Bariatric Surgery is interested in conducting a pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      study of apixaban (an oral anticoagulant with FDA approval for use of VTE prophylaxis and&#xD;
      treatment) in the obese adult population to determine if bariatric surgery influences&#xD;
      apixaban exposure. More interesting would be to see how the dose may need to change pre- vs.&#xD;
      post-bariatric surgery (this will be important for physicians as more and more patients&#xD;
      undergo this procedure worldwide and many may require anticoagulation in their future&#xD;
      healthcare).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To determine the pharmacokinetics of apixaban in obese patients scheduled to&#xD;
      have bariatric surgery with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 kg/m2 or greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1a: Obese patients prior to bariatric surgical intervention, compared to normal&#xD;
      weight historical controls, will have a decrease in both Cmax and area under the curve (AUC)&#xD;
      when given a single dose of 5 mg of apixaban.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine the pharmacokinetics of apixaban in the bariatric surgical&#xD;
      patient who has undergone Roux-en Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy&#xD;
      (VSG) at 1, 6, 12 and 18 months post-op.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2a: Patients who have recently undergone RYGB surgery (1 month post-op) will have&#xD;
      a decrease in both the Cmax and AUC, relative to pre-op values, when given a single dose of 5&#xD;
      mg of apixaban.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2b: Patients who have recently undergone VSG surgery (1 month post-op) will have a&#xD;
      decrease in both the Cmax and AUC, relative to pre-op values, when given a single dose of 5&#xD;
      mg of apixaban. The magnitude of the decrease in Cmax and AUC will be less than that seen in&#xD;
      RYGB patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: Anatomic alteration of the GI tract will immediately reduce absorption in all&#xD;
      post-operative bariatric patients. In RYGB patients, the attenuated small bowel and altered&#xD;
      bile acid composition will lead to decreased absorption of the drug, whereas in sleeve&#xD;
      gastrectomy patients prolonged gastric emptying may affect pharmacokinetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings will be important when considering the use of apixaban as an oral&#xD;
      anticoagulation option for perioperative VTE prophylaxis in the bariatric population, both in&#xD;
      the acute hospital setting and after discharge in patients requiring extended VTE prophylaxis&#xD;
      or treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2c: After undergoing bariatric surgery, patients at 6, 12, and 18 months post-op&#xD;
      will have an increase in Cmax and AUC, relative to pre-op values, when given a single dose of&#xD;
      5 mg of apixaban.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2d: After undergoing RYGB, patients at 6, 12, and 18 months post-op will have a&#xD;
      greater increase in both Cmax and AUC, relative to pre-op values, than VSG patients relative&#xD;
      to pre-op values when given a single dose of 5 mg of apixaban.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: Patients who are 6 to 18 months post-bariatric surgery generally have a 30-40%&#xD;
      decrease in excess body weight. This decrease in body weight reduces volume of distribution&#xD;
      of drug, potentially affecting Cmax. Results of the published Phase 1 apixaban study found&#xD;
      that exposure to a dose of apixaban was inversely related to body weight. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators should expect higher plasma levels of apixaban in patients who are 6 to 18&#xD;
      months post-bariatric surgery when compared to pre-op values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings of the Phase I study (3,4) An open-label, parallel-group, non-randomized,&#xD;
      single-dose study in healthy male and female subjects was conducted to assess the effects of&#xD;
      body weight on the pharmacokinetics of a single 10 mg dose of apixaban. Following screening,&#xD;
      patients were enrolled in one of three groups: low body weight (≤50kg, N=18), normal body&#xD;
      weight (65-85kg, N=18) or high body weight (≥120kg, N=19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to normal body weight:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There was a 27% increase in Cmax and 20% increase in AUC in patients with low body&#xD;
           weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There was a 31% decrease in Cmax and 23% decrease in AUC in patients with high body&#xD;
           weight&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of RYGB vs. sleeve gastrectomy on long-term pharmacokinetics is difficult to&#xD;
      predict because of the opposing effects of greater weight loss with reduced absorption in the&#xD;
      RYGB patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings will be important when considering apixaban as an oral medication for&#xD;
      long-term post-op bariatric patients who may require anticoagulation for stroke, myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, atrial fibrillation or orthopedic procedures such as hip or knee replacements.&#xD;
      (5, 6)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To measure the effect of apixaban on Factor Xa activity (chromogenic anti-Xa&#xD;
      activity assay) in bariatric surgical patients pre-operatively then at 1, 6, 12 and 18 months&#xD;
      post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3a: In spite of the changes in pharmacokinetics, the pharmacodynamics response&#xD;
      (measured with a chromogenic anti-Xa activity assay) will not differ by more than 10% in&#xD;
      comparing pre-surgical response to that at 1, 6, 12 and 18 months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: The changes in pharmacokinetics should not lead to a different&#xD;
      concentration-response relationship in the chromogenic anti- Xa activity of individual&#xD;
      patients following dosing with apixaban 5 mg. Were there to be a significant change in&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics, other factors due to the altered anatomy or substantial weight loss would&#xD;
      need to be invoked to explain that altered relationship.&#xD;
