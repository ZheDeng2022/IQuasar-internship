    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized trial was to compare reconstructive surgery of advanced&#xD;
      peri-implant intra-osseous defects with porous titanium granules (PTG/Test) to open flap&#xD;
      debridement (OFD/Control) in a non-submerged technique over 6 months.&#xD;

      Scientific rationale for study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a paucity of data for the effectiveness of reconstructive procedures in the&#xD;
      treatment of peri-implantitis. Recently, titanium brushes have been introduced for implant&#xD;
      surface debridement and porous titanium granules (PTG) as an osteoconductive bone substitute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design The study was designed as a prospective multicentre, multi-national, randomized,&#xD;
      parallel group-controlled clinical trial of 6 months duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participating investigators attended training and calibration meetings to discuss and&#xD;
      optimize patient accrual and retention as well as data management. Preliminary clinical cases&#xD;
      were discussed to standardize case selection, the measurement techniques and surgical&#xD;
      procedures. On-site rules, for the compilation of the data collection sheets for appropriate&#xD;
      oversight were frequently reassured by a study monitor to ensure the validity of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open flap debridement and surface decontamination with titanium brush (n = 30/Control), or&#xD;
      additional insertion of PTG (n=33/Test) was performed for reconstruction of 3- or 4-wall&#xD;
      intra-osseous peri-implant defects with at least 3 mm defect depth and circumferential&#xD;
      (≥270°) morphology. Patients were given amoxicillin and metronidazole for 8 days.&#xD;
      Radiographic and clinical assessments were performed at baseline and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population Study subjects were recruited consecutively from patients treated by dental&#xD;
      specialists in periodontology or implantology in Germany (University of Bonn), the&#xD;
      Netherlands (Amsterdam), Italy (Rome University), Spain (University Madrid) and Sweden&#xD;
      (Kristianstad University). Each participant signed an informed consent in accordance with the&#xD;
      Helsinki Declaration of 1975 as revised in 2008. The Ethical Committee for human subject&#xD;
      trials in each institution approved the study protocol individually. Seventy informed and&#xD;
      consenting patients above the age of 18 years of age with a diagnosis of peri-implantitis&#xD;
      were enrolled in the study and surgery was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-surgical treatment and evaluation Clinical screening included medical history, physical&#xD;
      examination and admission criteria. All necessary endodontic and periodontal treatments were&#xD;
      finished as evaluated with recording of pocket probing depth (PPD), inflammation (BoP) and&#xD;
      plaque at least 1 month prior to the peri-implant surgical procedure and to entry into the&#xD;
      study. Potential prosthetic factors to the aetiology of the disease process were resolved&#xD;
      prior to study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who met all criteria for inclusion, verified at surgery, underwent baseline&#xD;
      measurements and investigational procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical measurements Baseline measurements at the included implant site were performed on&#xD;
      the same day as the surgical procedure. All probing measurements were obtained with a&#xD;
      pressure (0.20-0.25N) sensitive probe (Click-Probe®, Kerr, Switzerland) to the nearest mm at&#xD;
      6 sites per tooth/implant (mesio-buccal, buccal, disto-buccal, disto-palatal, palatal,&#xD;
      mesio-palatal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline and 6-months visits, the following recordings were taken:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Probing pocket depths (PPD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bleeding on probing (BoP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Suppuration (PUS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plaque BoP and PUS at the affected implant sites were assessed within 30 seconds&#xD;
           following probing of the pocket/implant mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative measurements during surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intra-osseous defect component (mm) at the deepest point.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Circumference of the osseous defect (degrees), 3 or 4 wall intra-osseous component.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Defect width (mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic measurements Intra-oral peri-apical radiographs were obtained using a&#xD;
      reproducible technique with standard Eggen holders and long cone equipped dental X-ray units.&#xD;
      All radiographs presenting study implants were digitalized, coded and evaluated by a computer&#xD;
      program (MATLAB® Vers. R2013b software for MAC OS 10.9; Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographs were studied by changing parameters in black and white modus as well as in colour&#xD;
      look-up tables. Measurements from a well defined reference point at the coronal part of the&#xD;
      implant body taken at baseline and 6-months visits were: vertical defect depth and width,&#xD;
      marginal bone level and horizontal bone level. Based on these measurements, changes in&#xD;
      vertical defect depth, marginal bone level, % defect fill and % defect resolution from&#xD;
      baseline to 6 month were calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most coronal confluent aggregation of bone or graft material was used to define bone&#xD;
      levels. Single isles of bone or bone-like material were not considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implant length and width or known dimensions of implant-threads were used as reference for&#xD;
      calibration of measurements. The implant abutment interface served as well defined landmark&#xD;
      reference for follow-up recordings. Radiographic evaluations were performed by a physicist&#xD;
      trained on sample images on a LCD-display with a resolution of 2560 x 1600 and a 32-Bit&#xD;
      colour pixel depth and two periodontists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation/Power analysis The calculation of patients to be treated (sample&#xD;
      size) was based on a previous proof-of-concept single-centre RCT (Wohlfahrt et al. 2012) and&#xD;
      the primary objective to detect a true mean difference of at least 2 mm between test and&#xD;
      control treatment for radiographic defect fill after 6 months. With a level of significance&#xD;
      of alpha = 0.05 in a two-sided hypothesis and a power of 90 %, the number of patients needed&#xD;
      was 48. Assuming a dropout rate of about 30% the total number of patients required was 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization, Allocation Concealment and Blinding Patients were randomly assigned to&#xD;
      treatment modality by using a randomization scheme prepared prior to study initiation and to&#xD;
      treatment in blocks of 6. The patients were allocated to either reconstruction of the defect&#xD;
      with PTG (Test group) or closure of the flap after implant debridement (OFD/Control).&#xD;
      Documentation of treatment allocation for each patient was placed in separate, sealed opaque&#xD;
      envelopes that were opened and revealed to the surgeon after debridement of the defect and&#xD;
      implant surface was finished. Clinical examiners remained blinded to the treatment assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions Pre-Surgical Phase All patients had a full periodontal examination with probing&#xD;
      of pocket depth (PPD) and registration of full mouth bleeding and plaque scores. Pre-surgical&#xD;
      interventions included oral hygiene instructions to the individual needs of the patient and a&#xD;
      complete non-surgical and surgical periodontal treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Procedure A non-submerged surgical technique was used for both experimental and&#xD;
      control sites. Following administration of local anaesthesia flap elevation procedure&#xD;
      included an intra-crevicular incision around the implant. Full thickness mucoperiosteal flaps&#xD;
      were raised on the buccal and lingual aspect to gain access to the complete peri-implant&#xD;
      defect and to the implant surface. The extent of this incision was determined by&#xD;
      supra-crestal incisions extending mesial and distal of the implant site. Vertical incisions&#xD;
      into the vestibule at a distance of at least one tooth/implant from the implant were&#xD;
      performed as necessary for adequate access. Granulation tissue was removed using titanium&#xD;
      curettes (HuFriedy®, Chicago, IL, USA) and the exposed implant surfaces were cleaned&#xD;
      mechanically by using a rotary titanium brush (Tigran PeriBrush™, Tigran Technologies, Malmö,&#xD;
      Sweden) and decontaminated chemically with 3% H2O2 for 1 minute followed by rinsing with&#xD;
      saline for 60 seconds (2 x 20 ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following treatment allocation in accordance to randomization, titanium granules (Tigran™,&#xD;
      Tigran Technologies, Malmö, Sweden) were applied into the osseous defects of the test sites.&#xD;
      After insertion of the granules, excess material was carefully removed. Flaps were then&#xD;
      repositioned and sutured back into position using monofilament non-resorbable sutures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peri-operative protocol Patients were prescribed a combination of Amoxicillin 500 mg 3/day&#xD;
      for 8 days and Metronidazole 400 mg 2/day for 8 days, starting one day prior to surgery.&#xD;
      Patients were then instructed to rinse twice daily with chlorhexidine mouth rinse (0.2%) for&#xD;
      1 month. The patients used brushes as usual in other areas of the mouth. Anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      and analgesic therapy was prescribed (Ibuprofen 3 x 600 mg/day) during the first two days and&#xD;
      according to the individual needs thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sutures were removed after 7 to 14 days and patients were instructed in the use of soft&#xD;
      toothbrushes and soft interdental brushes (super soft - Gentle/Implant Care TePe, Malmö,&#xD;
      Sweden) in the surgical area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were recalled at 6 weeks, 3, 6 months after surgery for professional oral hygiene&#xD;
      procedures with individually based supra-gingival debridement and hygiene instructions as&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early withdrawal criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  non healing infections&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  substantial exfoliation of graft material (rejection)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  local intolerance to graft material&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  recurrence of active peri-implantitis at the test site&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  loosening of implant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  poor patient cooperation, not returning for control visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis of primary efficacy endpoint was performed using&#xD;
      stratified Wilcoxon test, using centre as stratification variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment intergroup comparisons of secondary efficacy endpoints were based on least squares&#xD;
      means obtained from the ANCOVA model. Least-square means for each treatment group and&#xD;
      differences in least-squares means between treatment groups are presented along with&#xD;
      associated 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) as well as p-values for differences within treatment&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analysis was performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical hypotheses for the Primary Objective was:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0: Δ bone level Test - Δ bone level Control = 0 H1: Δ bone level Test - Δ bone level Control&#xD;
      ≠ 0&#xD;
&#xD;
      For percent changes the statistical hypotheses was based on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Defect resolution=(Vertical defect baseline- Vertical defect 6months)/( Vertical defect&#xD;
           baseline) x100&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Defect Fill = (Marginal bone level baseline- Marginal bone level 6months )/( Vertical&#xD;
           defect baseline) x100&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the p-value from this analysis fell below 0.05 in both mesial and distal measurements it&#xD;
      was concluded that there was a statistically significant difference in average change between&#xD;
      the two treatment groups.&#xD;
