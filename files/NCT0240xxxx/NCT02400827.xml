  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For prepubertal patients, cryopreservation of ovarian tissue is the only option available to&#xD;
      preserve their fertility before cancer treatment. But ovarian autograft raises the issue of&#xD;
      the risk of reintroduction of potentially malignant cells. The aim of our study is to develop&#xD;
      a specific and sensitive method for residual disease detection in the ovarian tissue from&#xD;
      patients treated for a solid tumor during infancy, whose fertility may have been compromised&#xD;
      by treatments and who benefited of ovarian tissue cryopreservation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Some solid tumors have high risk of metastatic localization including in ovaries. There is&#xD;
      concern over the possible presence of malignant cells in ovarian tissue that could cause a&#xD;
      recurrence of the primary disease after reimplantation. Thus, the possibility of ovarian&#xD;
      tissue involvement needs to be evaluated with sensitive molecular methods. Those techniques&#xD;
      are now available for leukaemia but histology is still the only way for solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on our experience in detection by RT-PCR of minimal residual disease (MRD) in&#xD;
      neuroblastoma since 1994 [Tchirkov et al. 2003] and in ovarian tissue cryopreservation since&#xD;
      1995 [Schubert et al. 2005, Chambon in press], we want to develop a specific and sensitive&#xD;
      method for residual disease detection by RT-PCR in order to evaluate the tumor contamination&#xD;
      of ovarian harvested tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: We chose 3 models of pediatric solid tumors with high risk of metastases&#xD;
      and which often require sterilizing treatments (chemo and/or radiotherapy): neuroblastoma,&#xD;
      Ewing tumor and alveolar rhabdosarcoma. We will use four tumor cells lines: IMR32 and SK-NSH&#xD;
      for neuroblastoma; RD-ES for Ewing tumor; RH-30 for rhabdosarcoma. We plan to use 20&#xD;
      fragments per line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration: 12 months Study design: Ovarian tissue without known malignancy but with a&#xD;
      condition warranting laparoscopy (benign cysts) will be harvested during kystectomy&#xD;
      (perikystic tissue).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The harvested ovarian cortex will be cut: one half will be frozen according to our routine&#xD;
      protocol [Schubert et al. 2005] and the other half will be contaminated with tumor cells&#xD;
      lines. Then, detection of the specific transcript will be done by RT-PCR in fresh tissue and&#xD;
      after freeze/thaw. Total RNA will be extracted with the TRI-reagent and qRT-PCR will be&#xD;
      performed using the &quot;TaqMan&quot; technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: to reach a sensitivity about 1/106 cells.&#xD;
