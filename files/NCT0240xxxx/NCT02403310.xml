      The main purpose of this study is to determine the safety of combining selinexor with&#xD;
      daunorubicin and cytarabine. The maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of selinexor with daunorubicin&#xD;
      and cytarabine will also be established.&#xD;

      Induction Therapy - Dose escalation of selinexor with Daunorubicin and cytarabine at fixed&#xD;
      doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consolidation Phase - Patients who are in complete remission (CR) or complete remission with&#xD;
      incomplete count recovery (CRi) by day ≤70 and have recovered from any previous non-&#xD;
      hematologic toxicity to baseline or grade ≤1 by day ≤70 following induction chemotherapy may&#xD;
      go on to receive consolidation therapy for up to 2 cycles. The consolidation treatment phase&#xD;
      will include up to two courses of therapy (28 day cycles) as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daunorubicin 45mg/m^2/day (days 1-2) Cytarabine 100mg/m^2/day (continuous infusion on days&#xD;
      1-5) Selinexor same dose as induction (days 1,3,8,10) unless dose limiting toxicity (DLT)&#xD;
      dictates a dose reduction. Selinexor will be given 2 hours prior to daunorubicin on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second cycle of consolidation therapy using the same doses as above will be administered,&#xD;
      at the investigators discretion, between 28 and 42 days following initiation of the first&#xD;
      consolidation treatment, after peripheral blood counts have recovered to CR, CRi levels, and&#xD;
      after recovery from any non-hematologic toxicity to baseline or grade ≤1. Dose escalation of&#xD;
      Selinexor will not occur during the consolidation phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance Phase - Patients who remain in CR, CRi after up to 2 cycles of consolidation and&#xD;
      are not eligible for allogeneic stem cell transplant will be eligible for the maintenance&#xD;
      phase of treatment after recovery from any previous non-hematologic toxicity to baseline or&#xD;
      grade ≤1. Maintenance therapy will consist of:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selinexor at the same dose as induction on days 1 and 8 of a 21 day cycle. They will continue&#xD;
      for a maximum of 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expansion Phase - Once the MTD has been established, there will be an expansion phase to&#xD;
      enroll an additional 13 subjects at the MTD to better characterize the safety profile and&#xD;
      tolerability.&#xD;

Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT): Non-hematologic - Any grade 3-4 drug-related non-hematologic toxicity, with the following exceptions: Nausea/vomiting or diarrhea adequately controlled with antiemetics/antidiarrheals; Infection or febrile neutropenia adequately controlled with antibiotics; Liver function abnormalities (without clinical symptoms) that recover to baseline or grade 0-1 within 7 days; Grade 3-4 electrolyte or metabolic laboratory abnormalities that are not considered clinically significant by the treating investigator/physician and that recover to baseline or grade 0-1 within 7 days; Alopecia. Hematologic - Grade 3-4 neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia (thought to be due to marrow hypoplasia and NOT leukemic burden) that does not recover to grade ≤2 by day 56.</description>
