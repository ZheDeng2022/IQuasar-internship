      This study is determining whether the addition of cyclophosphamide to pomalidomide and&#xD;
      dexamethasone improves progression free survival in patients with relapsed refractory myeloma&#xD;
      (RRMM) compare to pomalidomide and dexamethasone alone. Patients will be randomised on a 1:1&#xD;
      basis to receive CPD or Pd. Treatment will be continued until disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma is the second most common hematologic malignancy in the European Union (EU),&#xD;
      responsible for an estimated 21,000 deaths in the EU in 2008. For patients that relapse or&#xD;
      are refractory to current standard treatment (combination of bortezomib/lenalidomide,&#xD;
      dexamethasone and an alkylating agent) there are few options available and therefore the&#xD;
      prognosis within this group is often poor with response to treatment decreasing with&#xD;
      successive relapses until resistant disease develops. . Current standard treatment at first&#xD;
      relapse in the UK is the use of bortezomib in combination with dexamethasone and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide. Another common treatment is lenalidomide given with dexamethasone and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide. The addition of cyclophosphamide has demonstrated to improve treatment&#xD;
      outcomes whilst being tolerated well. A recent clinical study has shown the addition of&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide to the combination of pomalidomide and dexamethasone has shown to be safe&#xD;
      and tolerable and beneficial in terms of treatment outcomes. The primary aim of this study is&#xD;
      to investigate whether the addition of cyclophosphamide to pomalidomide and dexamethasone&#xD;
      leads to an improved progression free survival. A secondary aim is to identify markers from&#xD;
      clinical material that will predict response to pomalidomide in a group of relapsed and&#xD;
      refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) patients to provide important information for use in&#xD;
      discussions with NICE on how best to improve the value and use of pomalidomide in the UK in&#xD;
      the RRMM setting.&#xD;
