    <textblock>
      The goal of this trial is to gain initial clinical experience regarding the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of treating type I diabetes in people who have received a kidney transplant by&#xD;
      transplanting islets into a new transplant site in the stomach (gastrointestinal submucosa).&#xD;
      A total of 6 patients will be enrolled in the study and followed for a period of up to 3&#xD;
      years after the last islet transplant.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pancreatic islet transplantation offers a minimally invasive approach to restore&#xD;
      normoglycemia in type 1 diabetics while avoiding the hypoglycemic complications observed with&#xD;
      intensive insulin therapy and the surgical complications associated with pancreas&#xD;
      transplantation. Although significant progress has been made in clinical islet&#xD;
      transplantation, overall outcomes remain suboptimal since many patients lose insulin&#xD;
      independence a few years after transplantation and multiple donors are usually needed to&#xD;
      achieve independence. The cause of this progressive loss of function is multifactorial, but&#xD;
      mounting evidence suggests that much of the islet loss after transplant is directly related&#xD;
      to the intraportal transplant site that is used in clinical islet transplantation.&#xD;
      Intravascular infusion of the islets triggers a severe,non-specific inflammatory response&#xD;
      (immediate blood-mediated inflammatory reaction, IBMIR) which destroys at least 50% of the&#xD;
      islet mass. The engraftment of the surviving islets is further compromised by the relatively&#xD;
      hypoxic portal venous environment, and the infused islets are exposed to potentially toxic&#xD;
      levels of immunosuppressive agents being absorbed from the gut into the portal circulation.&#xD;
      Together, these characteristics contribute to early as well as late loss of islet function&#xD;
      after transplantation. The gastrointestinal submucosa is a newly described transplant site&#xD;
      that can support islet engraftment while avoiding many of the drawbacks associated with&#xD;
      intraportal infusion. In addition, this site is easily accessible via upper endoscopy and the&#xD;
      submucosal injection procedure is safe and technically straightforward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this prospective, single-center trial is to provide initial clinical experience&#xD;
      regarding the safety and efficacy of endoscopic gastric and duodenal submucosal islet&#xD;
      transplantation in type I diabetic patients with kidney allografts. A total of 6 patients&#xD;
      will be recruited into the trial. The investigators will follow the standardized islet&#xD;
      manufacturing protocols and the thymoglobulin-based induction immunosuppressive regimen&#xD;
      developed by the Clinical Islet Transplant consortium (CIT). Outcomes will include safety&#xD;
      measures, glycemic control and insulin use, metabolic assessments of graft function,&#xD;
      allo/auto-immune responses, and protocol biopsies to assess graft rejection/inflammation. The&#xD;
      investigators believe that this novel approach to islet transplantation has the potential to&#xD;
      significantly improve current islet transplantation outcomes by enhancing islet engraftment&#xD;
      and long-term function.&#xD;

             failure is attributed to thrombosis within the first 4 weeks or to other technical&#xD;
             reasons that require graft pancreatectomy; with the graft pancreatectomy occurring&#xD;
             more than 6 months prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Untreated or unstable proliferative diabetic retinopathy.&#xD;

               -  Islet donor-directed anti-HLA antibodies detected by Luminex® Single&#xD;
                  Antigen/specificity bead assay including weakly reactive antibodies that would&#xD;
                  not be detected by a flow cross-match&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. For female subjects: Positive pregnancy test, presently breast-feeding, or&#xD;
