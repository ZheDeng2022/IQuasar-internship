      This study will enrol sexually active, healthy girls aged 16-17 to assess and compare the&#xD;
      acceptability and preference for a monthly vaginal ring, bi-monthly injectable contraception&#xD;
      or daily dose oral contraception, as proxy for female-controlled ARV-based HIV prevention&#xD;
      methods.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The family planning field has shown the importance of providing sufficient choice to meet&#xD;
      individuals' changing needs and preferences, and has demonstrated that diversifying delivery&#xD;
      modes and dosing options is key to expanding acceptability, use and continuation of&#xD;
      contraceptive products. It is not yet clear to what extent choice and preference of modes of&#xD;
      delivery will play in the biomedical HIV prevention world. It may be possible that closely&#xD;
      associated with the behavioural components of decision to use, uptake, and consistent&#xD;
      adherence to prevention products will hinge on a sense that a particular modality is&#xD;
      preferred or suits an individual compared to other modalities. Vaginal rings, pills, and&#xD;
      injectables have already proven successful in the field of contraception, and therefore may&#xD;
      act as surrogates for a range of HIV prevention delivery options that may help to meet the&#xD;
      different sexual and reproductive health concerns of women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A better understanding of the population of adolescents seeking contraception can also help&#xD;
      researchers understand the acceptability and feasibility of, as well as adherence to similar&#xD;
      modes of delivery for HIV prevention options. By using contraceptive methods as a proxy for&#xD;
      available female-controlled HIV prevention delivery methods, such as microbicides and PrEP,&#xD;
      we propose to examine in detail, the acceptability of these surrogates to adolescent women;&#xD;
      their preferences for mode of delivery; and their adherence barriers and facilitators thereof&#xD;
      to such products. Three contraceptive options will be used in this study to emulate the modes&#xD;
      of delivery currently being developed for HIV prevention options: (1) monthly vaginal ring&#xD;
      (NuvaRing), (2) bi-monthly injectable contraception (Nuristerate) and (3) daily dose oral&#xD;
      contraception (Triphasil or Nordette).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label, randomized crossover study of 150 sexually active female adolescents&#xD;
      (&gt;16 and &lt;18 years) to be recruited, with parental consent, and randomly assigned to a&#xD;
      monthly vaginal ring, bi-monthly injectable contraception, or daily dose oral contraception&#xD;
      at baseline. After 4 months, participants will crossover, ensuring that all participants use&#xD;
      the vaginal ring, and either the oral contraceptive or the bi-monthly injectable&#xD;
      contraceptive throughout the course of the study. Participants will be followed for a total&#xD;
      of 8 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon enrollment participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three study&#xD;
      arms (50 participants per arm):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1/Group A: Participants will receive an injectable contraceptive once every 8 weeks for a&#xD;
      4 month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2/Group B: Participants will receive the contraceptive intravaginal NuvaRing to be&#xD;
      inserted once every 28 days (and removed after 21 days of each 28 day insertion) for a 4&#xD;
      month period&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 3/Group C: Participants will be supplied with oral contraceptives and will be required to&#xD;
      take a daily tablet for 21 days each month and a placebo tablet for days 22 to 28 each month,&#xD;
      for a 4 month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 4 months, participants in Group A and Group C will be assigned to Group B; participants&#xD;
      in Group B will be allowed to select either Groups A or Group C, ensuring that all&#xD;
      participants use the vaginal ring, and most either the oral contraceptive or the bi-monthly&#xD;
      injectable contraceptive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend follow-up visits every 8 weeks throughout the duration of the study.&#xD;
      Those participants receiving the oral contraceptive or intravaginal ring will therefore&#xD;
      receive 8 weeks' product supply at each visit. At each visit preference / acceptability,&#xD;
      sexual behaviour and adherence to study product will be assessed using mainly quantitative&#xD;
      measures and general attitudes and experiences of use will be assessed in focus group&#xD;
      discussions at the end of the study.&#xD;
