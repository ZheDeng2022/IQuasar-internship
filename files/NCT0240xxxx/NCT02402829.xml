    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see if factor levels and inhibitor levels in&#xD;
      Hemophilia A and B subjects are accurate when they are drawn from a central venous line (CVL)&#xD;
      instead of from a peripheral stick.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with hemophilia A and B sometimes require the placement of a central venous line&#xD;
      (CVL). A CVL is a medical device that is placed into a vein that gives easier access to a&#xD;
      vein either for a blood draw or to give factor replacement product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with hemophilia are usually seen by the hemophilia doctor every year at the annual&#xD;
      comprehensive clinic visit. As part of this visit, the doctor usually orders routine blood&#xD;
      tests, including the factor level and inhibitor titer.The factor level and inhibitor blood&#xD;
      tests are always taken through a &quot;peripheral stick.&quot; A peripheral stick means that a small&#xD;
      needle is inserted into a vein in order to obtain a blood sample. The CVL is not used for&#xD;
      these blood draws. This is because the investigators don't know if the infusion of factor&#xD;
      replacement product and heparin (a blood thinning drug used to flush the line after a factor&#xD;
      infusion) can cause the blood sample results to be incorrect. The current practice is to take&#xD;
      blood through a needle stick in the vein because the investigators can be sure that the&#xD;
      results are accurate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When blood draws are taken through a peripheral stick, it can cause children with hemophilia&#xD;
      to be very anxious because of the pain involved with a needle stick. Also, the needle stick&#xD;
      can sometimes cause a bleed, which may require treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to see if factor levels and inhibitor levels are&#xD;
      accurate when they are drawn from a CVL instead of from a peripheral stick.&#xD;
