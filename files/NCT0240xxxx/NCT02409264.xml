  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In South Africa, 27% of adult males and 31% of adult females experience insomnia. Insomnia&#xD;
      may lead to feelings of fatigue and sleepiness, mood disturbances, cognitive difficulties,&#xD;
      and may exacerbate symptomatology of co-morbid diseases. Current conventional treatment for&#xD;
      insomnia includes both psychological and drug therapies. These conventional medications&#xD;
      potentially may lead to dependency and withdrawal symptoms. Individualised homeopathic&#xD;
      treatment is a process in which a homeopath selects the most appropriate remedy for the&#xD;
      treatment of a condition in accordance with the fundamental principles of homeopathy. This&#xD;
      treatment protocol may offer safe and effective treatment for insomnia disorder, however,&#xD;
      more research is required on the subject. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of&#xD;
      individualised homeopathic treatment of insomnia disorder in females using detailed case&#xD;
      studies and the Insomnia Severity Index.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will be of an embedded mixed method case study design, conducted at the University&#xD;
      of Johannesburg Doornfontein Homeopathic Health Clinic over a period of 8 weeks. Ten female&#xD;
      participants, aged 18 to 45 years, will be recruited by means of non-probability purposive&#xD;
      sampling via advertisements placed in the University of Johannesburg Homeopathic Health&#xD;
      Clinic and in pharmacies around Johannesburg, with the relevant permission given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nature of the study, as well as the requirements for participation will be fully&#xD;
      explained and the volunteers will be asked to sign the Participant Information and Consent&#xD;
      Form once they agree to participate. Potential participants will undergo a brief screening to&#xD;
      determine if they meet the requirements for this study. The participants that meet the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria will attend the initial consultation and those that do not meet the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria will be referred to the Homeopathic Health Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consultation will consist of a comprehensive homeopathic case history, the conduction of&#xD;
      relevant physical exams, including vital signs, and the completion of the Insomnia Severity&#xD;
      Index (ISI). The participant's case will be analysed and computer repertorised, using the&#xD;
      Complete Repertory of Mercurius homeopathic software (Aeon Group), version 5.3.0.17. The&#xD;
      individualised homeopathic remedy will be selected by the researcher who will refer to the&#xD;
      appropriate Materia Medica. The Homeopathic Dispenser will dispense the homeopathic remedy to&#xD;
      the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will return for four follow-up consultations which will be two weeks apart.&#xD;
      At each follow-up consultation the ISI will be completed and a follow-up case history and&#xD;
      physical examination of the participants' vital signs will be conducted. The participants'&#xD;
      symptoms will be re-evaluated and a remedy prescribed accordingly. At the final consultation&#xD;
      in the 8th week, no remedy will be prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected and analysed by the researcher with the assistance of a statistician&#xD;
      at Statkon, using non-parametric tests, including: frequencies and descriptives, the Friedman&#xD;
      test, and Wilcoxon post hoc test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The possible outcome of this study may demonstrate that individualised homeopathic treatment&#xD;
      is effective in reducing the frequency and intensity of insomnia disorder in females, and&#xD;
      instigate further research on the subject.&#xD;
