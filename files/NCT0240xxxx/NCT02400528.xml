  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The studies conducted so far concerning the medical and paramedical cares provided to&#xD;
      patients with profound and multiple disabilities (PMD) often show important limitations:&#xD;
      samples are too small or very heterogeneous, generally constituted of children only; studies&#xD;
      are mainly cross-sectional and retrospective, focusing on very specific issues instead of&#xD;
      assessing health and quality of life from a more global perspective… So far, the&#xD;
      investigators found no published data from a prospective cohort study involving a&#xD;
      representative sample of patients with PMD. The present project aims to set up such a cohort&#xD;
      so as to describe for the first time the natural history of French patients with PMD as well&#xD;
      as the cares they receive at home or within the different dedicated structures in France.&#xD;
      This cohort will also make it possible to identify the factors responsible for differences in&#xD;
      the cares patients are provided, the consequences of these differences on their health and&#xD;
      their quality of life (and those of their relatives) as well as the evolutions of these data&#xD;
      over time. It will then allow for assessing the effectiveness of the French healthcare system&#xD;
      to care for patients with PMD as well as building a frame of reference regarding the best&#xD;
      cares to provide to these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this study is to identify the determinants of health among patients with&#xD;
      PMD.&#xD;
