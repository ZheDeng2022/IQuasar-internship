    <textblock>
      Clopidogrel has been shown to slow down tumor progression in orthoptic pancreatic murine&#xD;
      tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a pilot study, the rate of microparticles was correlated with response rate of pancreatic&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to compare the phenotypes of coagulation, the tumor progression and metastasis formation&#xD;
           with and without clopidogrel treatment in association with chemotherapy in advanced&#xD;
           pancreatic cancer patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to correlate the decrease of microparticles levels after one month of chemotherapy with&#xD;
           tumor response (ancillary study)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have been performed to understand the cellular mechanisms involved in the&#xD;
      development of VTE in cancer patients. The pathogenesis of a thrombotic state is linked to&#xD;
      the presence of a tumor and is associated with the development of a hypercoagulant state,&#xD;
      namely coagulopathy, which confers numerous advantages to the cancer cells. Indeed, both&#xD;
      activation of the coagulation cascade and aggregation of blood platelets around cancer cells&#xD;
      protect themselves from the immune response; facilitate their circulation in the bloodstream&#xD;
      and their adhesion at potential sites of metastasis. Beside its implication in the activation&#xD;
      of coagulation, the TF/FVIIa complex also influences pathways that activate cell-bound&#xD;
      protease activated receptors (PARs) leading to the activation of inflammatory and angiogenic&#xD;
      responses. Furthermore, a soluble variant of TF, known as alternatively spliced TF (asTF)&#xD;
      stimulates angiogenesis independent of FVIIa. This leads to a model in which the presence of&#xD;
      Tissue Factor (TF), generation of thrombin and platelets activation all directly participate&#xD;
      to the cancer progression and dissemination. The presence of TF and the activation of&#xD;
      platelets participate to the progression of the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A retrospective study collected clinical information and plasma samples of 117 patients with&#xD;
      pancreatic or biliary cancer, of which 68% were pancreatic cancer and 29% biliary cancers.&#xD;
      Thrombotic events occurred in 52 (44.4%) patients. Mean and median tissue factor for all&#xD;
      patients were 2.15 pg/mL and 1.20 pg/mL, respectively (range: 0.17-31.01 pg/mL). Elevated&#xD;
      Tissue Factor levels were significantly associated with VTE events (P=0.04), and an elevated&#xD;
      tissue Factor level was associated with a worse overall survival (hazard ratio, HR: 1.05;&#xD;
      P=0.01).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This procoagulant state could be due to the expression of active TF and transmembrane&#xD;
      proteins (PSGL-1, Muc1, …) by the cancer cell itself or cancer cell-derived microparticles&#xD;
      leading to platelets activation and aggregation. While studying the key role of TF bearing&#xD;
      cancer cell-derived microparticles in cancer associated thrombosis, the investigators have&#xD;
      previously shown (Dubois C, INSERM UMR 1076 Marseille) that both endogenously generated and&#xD;
      exogenously injected pancreatic cancer cell-derived microparticles expressing TF (PancO2),&#xD;
      but not their parental tumor cells, accumulated at the site of injury in a P-selectin&#xD;
      dependent manner. Their presence directly correlates with the size of the thrombus. Based on&#xD;
      these data, the investigators first hypothesized that treatment with anticoagulant and / or&#xD;
      antiplatelet drugs may prevent tumor progression and formation of metastasis, as well as&#xD;
      thrombosis associated cancer, in addition to prevention of coagulopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then Dubois &amp; al compared the effect of an inhibitor of platelet activation, Clopidogrel, and&#xD;
      an inhibitor of the activation of the coagulant cascade, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)&#xD;
      on tumor growth and thrombosis associated with cancer. Concentrations of drugs used were&#xD;
      calculated to induce a 50% reduction of thrombus formation following a laser-induced injury&#xD;
      in healthy mice. A diminution of kinetics of tumor growth was observed in mice treated by the&#xD;
      2 drugs in comparison with non-treated mice. Twenty days following injection of cancer cells,&#xD;
      the volume of the tumor was reduced by 85% and 87% when LMHW or Clopidogrel were used,&#xD;
      respectively. However, kinetics of tumor growth and volumes of tumors 20 days post-injection&#xD;
      were similar in mice treated by Clopidogrel in presence or absence of pathological TF&#xD;
      expressed by cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer cell-derived microparticles are responsible for the thrombotic phenotype observed in&#xD;
      mice developing a cancer via interactions between P-selectin expressed by aggregating&#xD;
      platelets and activated endothelium and PSGL-1 present at the surface of cancer cell-derived&#xD;
      microparticles. Before injury but after their infusion in bloodstream, exogenous labeled&#xD;
      cancer cell-derived microparticles were detected in the cremaster microcirculation of&#xD;
      non-treated or Clopidogrel treated mice. However, following an injury, cancer cell-derived&#xD;
      microparticles were accumulating at the site of thrombus formation only in non-treated mice&#xD;
      bearing a PancO2-LowTF or High TF tumor. Tissue Factor (TF) is both a main effector of the&#xD;
      coagulation cascade and a protein involved in the development of solid tumors. In vivo,&#xD;
      following a laser-induced injury, the activation of the endothelial wall, as well as the&#xD;
      presence of activated platelets, are the main source of P-selectin. The quantity of&#xD;
      P-selectin present at the site of injury was 4 fold less important in mice bearing a PancO2&#xD;
      tumor and treated by Clopidogrel in comparison with non-treated mice. Interestingly, PanCO2&#xD;
      cancer cell-derived microparticles express both TF and TFPI (Tissue Factor Inhibitor), a&#xD;
      biological inhibitor of the coagulation cascade in an active form. To confirm that&#xD;
      cancer-cell derived microparticles may participate in the inhibition of the blood coagulation&#xD;
      observed when the pathological TF is shut down, the investigators compared fibrin generation&#xD;
      at the site of injury in PancO2-High TF and Low-TF cancer mice in presence of absence of&#xD;
      Clopidogrel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fibrin formation at the site of laser-induced injury was significantly more important&#xD;
      (P&lt;0,01) in mice following injection of Panc02-High TF in comparison with wild type mice.&#xD;
      Treatment of these mice by Clopidogrel diminished the production of fibrin at a level&#xD;
      comparable to the ones observed in wild type mice. When the pathological TF was shut down,&#xD;
      production of fibrin was strongly reduced in comparison with both the group of mice injected&#xD;
      by Panc02 cells and the group of wild type mice. the investigators conclude that when cancer&#xD;
      cells and cancer cell-derived microparticles express active TF, their incorporation to a&#xD;
      growing thrombus participates to the generation of a thrombotic phenotype. When TF expressed&#xD;
      by cancer cells is shut down, cancer cells microparticles still incorporate at the site of&#xD;
      thrombus formation, but reduces activation of TF, inhibiting fibrin generation and thrombus&#xD;
      formation by bringing TFPI at the site of injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on observations, the investigators hypothesized that inhibition of platelet activation&#xD;
      by reducing both thrombosis associated with cancer and tumor growth could constitute an&#xD;
      interesting therapy to treated cancer and thrombosis. To test the hypothesis the&#xD;
      investigators then developed a syngeneic orthoptic model of pancreatic cancer and could&#xD;
      confirm that when mice were treated with Clopidogrel or Aspirin, the growth of the primary&#xD;
      tumor was significantly reduced and the development of metastasis was limited (Mege et al.).&#xD;
      However the benefit from aspirin was observed in mice only when treated immediately at time&#xD;
      of onset of cancer, id est when injection of cancer cells were performed. On the contrary,&#xD;
      the effects of clopidogrel were obtained independently of the tumor size, and tumor&#xD;
      development or onset and even once cancer was at an advanced stage. Altogether with the&#xD;
      action of anti-platelet drugs on thrombosis, these results indicate that Clopidogrel does&#xD;
      represent a promising therapeutic drug to limit thrombosis and reduce the development of&#xD;
      tumors and metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators showed in the experimental model that TF expressed by cancer cells was&#xD;
      involved in thrombosis associated with a cancer and in the growth of the tumor in vivo.&#xD;
      Beside its functions in coagulation, TF was also described following phosphorylation and&#xD;
      binding of its cytoplasmic tail to filamin, to induce transcriptional activation of different&#xD;
      growth factors, including VEGF. This intracellular pathway may also participate in the growth&#xD;
      of the tumor, but also in angiogenesis. Furthermore, TF expression was also reported to&#xD;
      influence motility, survival and proliferation of cancer cells via the activation of PAR-1&#xD;
      and PAR-2, although in this study proliferation of Panc02 cells were not affected by&#xD;
      inhibition of TF expression. Cancer cells may directly activate platelets by secreting ADP,&#xD;
      Thromboxane A2 and MMP-2 (Matrix Metallo Proteinase 2) and express at their surface ligands&#xD;
      to platelets, such as PSGL-1. In bloodstream, this leads to an aggregation of platelets&#xD;
      around cancer cells described to protect them from destruction by the immune system, blood&#xD;
      shear stress and to facilitate cancer cells interactions with the endothelium. However, the&#xD;
      direct involvement of these platelet agonists was not demonstrated in vivo. When mice were&#xD;
      treated with LMWH, a decrease in tumor development was observed similar to the ones obtained&#xD;
      when pathological TF was shut down. Also, treatment by Clopidogrel did not significantly&#xD;
      affect the growth of the tumor in the group of Panc02 miRNA TF mice or in the group of Panc02&#xD;
      mice treated by LMWH. This strongly suggests that activation of platelets is involved in the&#xD;
      growth of the tumor, but also that the main activator of platelet is TF expressed by cancer&#xD;
      cells and nor ADP nor Thromboxane A2. These secondary agonists may be involved when secreted&#xD;
      as a consequence of platelet activation generated by thrombin through a TF dependent pathway.&#xD;
      Last, they may play an important role not directly in the growth of the tumor, but rather in&#xD;
      the formation of metastasis when cancer cells have to be present in the bloodstream.&#xD;
