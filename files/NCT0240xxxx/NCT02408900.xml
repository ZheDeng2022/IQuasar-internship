      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is a rare disease. It leads to weakness in the muscle of&#xD;
      the arms, legs, and face. People with PLS develop muscle stiffness called spasticity.&#xD;
      Researchers want to find a better way to measure this. They want to see if ultrasound, which&#xD;
      uses sound waves to look at parts of the body, can measure spasticity and stiffness in&#xD;
      muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if ultrasound can detect and measure muscle spasticity in people with PLS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People ages 18 75 who have a diagnosis of PLS and are enrolled in protocol 01-N-0145.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers ages 18 75.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with PLS will have 1 study visit. Healthy participants will have upto 5&#xD;
           visits. Each visit will be about 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have tests of muscle strength. They will be examined. They will push&#xD;
           their arms and legs against researchers in different positions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have tests of muscle stiffness. Their arms and legs will be moved&#xD;
           while they relax.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a muscle ultrasound test. They will lie on a table. Gel will be&#xD;
           placed on the skin over the muscles of the arms and legs. A probe, like a microphone,&#xD;
           will be moved over the skin. Researchers will look at several muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants should try to stay still during the ultrasound. It may be done several&#xD;
           times and may be done by different examiners.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persons with corticospinal, or upper motor neuron dysfunction have increased muscle stiffness&#xD;
      from spasticity. Spasticity is established by clinical examination, but there are few&#xD;
      reliable objective measures of spasticity. New ultrasound techniques to measure the elastic&#xD;
      properties of tissue represent a potential measure of spasticity. The ultrasound measures of&#xD;
      tissue elasticity are painless and quick to perform, but their ability to detect changes&#xD;
      resulting from spasticity is uncertain. The goal of this pilot study is to see how much&#xD;
      ultrasound measures of muscle elasticity differ between patients with spasticity and healthy&#xD;
      controls. Secondary objectives are to correlate muscle elasticity measures with a clinical&#xD;
      rating scale of spasticity and to assess intra and inter-rater reliability. This is a&#xD;
      protocol for primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) patients who are enrolled in another NIH study&#xD;
      in which they have been diagnosed with spasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      23 adult PLS patients with arm or leg spasticity currently enrolled in an NIH protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 healthy adult controls with normal neurological exams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first phase, an investigator training phase, is aimed to become familiar with the Siemens&#xD;
      Acuson S2000 after the upgrade. The two investigators will train with 5 healthy volunteers.&#xD;
      In the second phase inter-observer variability of the ultrasound and Ashworth scale will be&#xD;
      assessed by having healthy volunteers and patients evaluated by the different investigators.&#xD;
      Since spasticity does fluctuate throughout the day, subjects will be consecutively assessed&#xD;
      for inter-observer variability and within a few hours or around the same time the following&#xD;
      day (depending on patient availability) for intra-observer variability. Each investigator&#xD;
      will do the Ashworth scale independent of the other. Each investigator will do the ultrasound&#xD;
      independent of the other. In the third phase, we will assess patients and volunteers to reach&#xD;
      the sample size that a power analysis suggested that we would need to measure differences&#xD;
      between patients with spasticity and controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be measuring muscle stiffness from the biceps brachii using&#xD;
      ultrasound elastography, which will be compared between patient groups and control groups. A&#xD;
      secondary outcome will be the correlation of muscle stiffness at rest with the modified&#xD;
      Ashworth score for elbow flexion. Measures of muscle strength and ultrasound measures of&#xD;
      density and thickness will be examined in an exploratory fashion. Elastography of the&#xD;
      tibialis anterior will be examined in an exploratory fashion.&#xD;
