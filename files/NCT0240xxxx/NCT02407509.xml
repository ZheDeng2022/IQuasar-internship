      In Part I of the study RO5126766 will be given twice weekly or three times per week in&#xD;
      treatment cycles of 4 weeks to investigate a safe and tolerable dose of the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the optimal dosing schedule is defined, the following patients with BRAF, KRAS and/or&#xD;
      NRAS mutations will be enrolled: 26 patients with solid tumours (Part IIA&amp;C), 10 patients&#xD;
      with Multiple Myeloma (Part IIB) and upto 34 patients with solid tumours who will take&#xD;
      RO5126766 in combination with everolimus (Part IID).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two centre Phase I trial evaluating two intermittent dosing schedules of RO5126766&#xD;
      alone and then in combination with everolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I (COMPLETED): Patients will be given RO5126766 (4mg) twice weekly or three times per&#xD;
      week in treatment cycles of 4 weeks to investigate a safe and tolerable dose of the drug.&#xD;
      Upto six patients will be enrolled to each dosing schedule and once they have completed 1&#xD;
      cycle of treatment the Safety Review Committee (SRC) will review their safety data, PK and PD&#xD;
      data and define the optimal schedule to be taken forward into Part II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of the previous Phase I trial, dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) are not expected&#xD;
      at a dose of 4 mg but in the event of ≥ 2 DLT's occurring in (a) the 2 x weekly arm, then no&#xD;
      further patients will recruited into that arm and the schedule will not be taken forward to&#xD;
      Part II, or (b) the 3 x weekly arm, a single dose reduction to 3.2mg on the same dosing&#xD;
      schedule will be implemented and 6 patients enrolled at the reduced dose. If 4 mg given 3 x&#xD;
      weekly is considered non-tolerable then the SRC may decide to enrol patients to the 3.2 mg&#xD;
      dose level in the absence of dose limiting toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If both the 2 x weekly (Mon &amp; Thurs) and 3 x weekly (Mon, Wed &amp; Fri) schedule are&#xD;
           tolerated at 4 mg i.e. &lt; 2 DLT's out of a 6 patients in each schedule, then the 3 x&#xD;
           weekly schedule will be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the 3 x weekly schedule requires a dose reduction to 3.2 mg and the 2 x weekly&#xD;
           schedule is tolerated at 4 mg then PD data will be evaluated relative to AUC to aid the&#xD;
           selection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If ≥2 DLT's occur out of 6 patients in both schedules (despite the 3 x weekly arm being&#xD;
           dose reduced), Part II will not be initiated and the study will be terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of the optimum schedule from Part I will be made by the Safety Review Committee and&#xD;
      will be the schedule that delivers the highest, tolerable, cumulative weekly dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II: Once the optimal dosing schedule has been established in Part I, the following&#xD;
      groups of patients will be enrolled:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part IIA (COMPLETED) - 20 patients with documented RAS-RAF-MEK pathway mutant solid tumours&#xD;
      (including KRAS, NRAS or BRAF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part IIB - 10 patients with documented KRAS, NRAS or BRAF multiple myeloma. NB: In order to&#xD;
      accommodate steroid use for patients with multiple myeloma, the optimal dosing schedule as&#xD;
      determined in Part I will be administered for 3 weeks followed by a week interruption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part IIC (COMPLETED) - An additional 6 patients with RAS-RAF-MEK pathway mutant solid tumours&#xD;
      (including but not exclusive to KRAS, NRAS or BRAF) will be enrolled at the MTD determined in&#xD;
      Part I however, upon occurrence of Grade 2 drug-related skin rash, CPK elevation or diarrhoea&#xD;
      the dosing intensity will be reduced to 3 weeks followed by a week interruption. Of the six&#xD;
      patients in Part IIC, at least three patients should have KRAS mutant lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part IID - a maximum of 34 patients with documented RAS-RAF-MEK pathway mutant solid tumours&#xD;
      (including KRAS, NRAS and/or BRAF) will be administered with the combination of R05126766 and&#xD;
      everolimus.&#xD;

&#xD;
             Part IID specific exclusions:&#xD;

                  intake for at least 8 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Any other condition which in the Investigator's opinion would not make the patient a&#xD;
             good candidate for a clinical trial with Everolimus. Examples of which include:&#xD;
             hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency or&#xD;
             glucose-galactose malabsorption; hypersensitivity to Everolimus, to other rapamycin&#xD;
