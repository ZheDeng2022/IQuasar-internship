  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Airway irritation, cough and bronchial spasm are common symptoms in patients with airway&#xD;
      inflammatory diseases such as asthma. The primary focus of this exploratory study is to&#xD;
      determine if there is an increase in tissue temperature in airway mucosa during asthma&#xD;
      exacerbation. The results of this study will bring a better understanding of the potential&#xD;
      involvement of an increase in airway mucosa temperature in the pathogenesis of various&#xD;
      symptoms in these patients. The finding should help to advance the development of new&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies for these debilitating diseases.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of eight participants will be enrolled into this study. We will take direct&#xD;
      measurements of bronchial mucosa temperature. This can only be tested accurately in asthma&#xD;
      participants because anesthesia is known to lower the body temperature. The proposed study&#xD;
      using and experimental procedure called a segmental bronchoprovocation challenge with&#xD;
      allergen in asthmatic patients offers a unique approach to test our hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals enrolled into this study will participate for eight weeks and will take part in&#xD;
      four visits each estimated to last 2 and 8 hours. Participants will also participant in one&#xD;
      follow-up phone call following Test day 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with asthma and healthy participants will be recruited to participate in this study&#xD;
      through advertisement postings in the Kentucky Clinic and/or the University of Kentucky&#xD;
      Hospital as well as on main campus. The study will also be added to a website using the same&#xD;
      posting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with asthma who have been prescribed for a diagnostic or therapeutic bronchoscopy&#xD;
      procedure at the UK Pulmonary Clinic will be identified and recruited by qualified physicians&#xD;
      in that clinic. The medical history and records of the patients will be made available which&#xD;
      includes data form a complete spirometry test and other clinical tests, physical examination,&#xD;
      smoking history, symptoms, current medication use, drug allergies, laboratory and imaging&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After eligible patients are identified and meet proper inclusion criteria, informed consent&#xD;
      will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive an explanation of the research project including any potential&#xD;
      risks. In addition, the participant will be shown the actual size of the temperature probe to&#xD;
      be used in this procedure. The participation of these individuals in the study will in no way&#xD;
      affect their current treatment. No bias will be held against the individual by any clinical&#xD;
      staff if they elect not to participate in the study. Informed consent will be obtained after&#xD;
      the potential participant is fully informed via verbal/written information of the procedures&#xD;
      and nature of the research, the risks involved, and their rights as a research subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental procedure will be carried out in the University of Kentucky A.B. Chandler&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct measurements of the airway mucosal temperature will be performed before and at ten&#xD;
      minutes after the SBP-Ag challenge. This miniature probe will be positioned in the airway&#xD;
      lumen using an Olympus fiberoptic bronchoscope (model MP160F), and connected via a cable to a&#xD;
      battery-operated thermometer (model FLL) manufactured also by Physitemp Instrument Inc. The&#xD;
      probe (outside diameter of 0.4 mm) will be passed through the instrument channel (inner&#xD;
      diameter: 2.0 mm) of the bronchoscope. By maneuvering the control knob of the bronchoscope,&#xD;
      the blunted tip of the probe will be gently pressed against the airway mucosa at 5-6&#xD;
      different positions in segmental and sub-segmental bronchi, each for five to ten seconds. The&#xD;
      entire protocol of the temperature measurement will require no more than 5 minutes to&#xD;
      complete. The contact of the temperature probe on the airway mucosa should not cause any&#xD;
      tissue damage, and is relatively non-invasive compared to other procedures involved in the&#xD;
      routine bronchoscopy such as biopsy, cytology brushing, etc&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Examination: It will include assessment of subject's general condition, head and&#xD;
      neck, chest and respiratory auscultation, cardiac auscultation, and limited abdominal,&#xD;
      extremity and neurological exams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital signs: Heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature and arterial oxygen saturation.&#xD;

      obtaining written informed consent.&#xD;
