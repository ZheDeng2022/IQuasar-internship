  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A nasal endotracheal tube (ETT) is routinely placed in children and a fiberoptic scope (FOS)&#xD;
      is commonly used for this purpose. Resistance to the passage of ETT is frequently encountered&#xD;
      as it is advanced over the FOS for placement into the trachea, since it gets hung up on&#xD;
      structures of the laryngeal inlet. The aim of the investigators study performed on forty&#xD;
      children divided in two groups was to study in the pediatric population, whether a 90°&#xD;
      counterclockwise rotation (CCR) of the ETT prior to advancing through the larynx, by nasal&#xD;
      approach, prevents it from getting hung up at the laryngeal inlet.&#xD;

      A nasal endotracheal tube (ETT) is routinely placed in children and a fiberoptic scope (FOS)&#xD;
      is commonly used for this purpose. Resistance to the passage of ETT is frequently encountered&#xD;
      as it is advanced over the FOS for placement into the trachea, since it gets hung up on&#xD;
      structures of the laryngeal inlet. The aim of the investigators study performed on forty&#xD;
      children divided in two groups was to study in the pediatric population, whether a 90°&#xD;
      counterclockwise rotation (CCR) of the ETT prior to advancing through the larynx, by nasal&#xD;
      approach, prevents it from getting hung up at the laryngeal inlet.Following the approval of&#xD;
      Nemours Institutional Review Board, and informed consent, forty healthy children were&#xD;
      included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All children were randomly assigned to one of two groups using a computer generated numbers&#xD;
      table. Group-S (Standard technique): It involved placement of ETT over the FOS with bevel of&#xD;
      the ETT facing left as is routinely done Group-R (pre-Rotated technique): It involved&#xD;
      placement of ETT over the FOS with 90° CCR from the beginning so that the bevel of the ETT&#xD;
      faced posteriorly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All children received midazolam premedication prior to coming to the operating room and were&#xD;
      anesthetized by a standard technique using mask induction with oxygen, nitrous oxide and&#xD;
      sevoflurane. Intravenous line was placed and rocuronium 0.4 mg/kg body weight was then&#xD;
      administered to achieve muscle relaxation. Oxymetazoline hydrochloride lotion (Afrin) was&#xD;
      sprayed in both nostrils to achieve nasal mucosal decongestion and the ETT of appropriate&#xD;
      size for that age was used for nasotracheal intubation. Small FOS (Olympus LF-P; 2.2 mm&#xD;
      diameter) was used for cuffed ETT (MallinckrodtTM; Covidien) sizes 4.5 mm ID and under and&#xD;
      larger FOS (Olympus LF-DP; 3.1 mm diameter) was used for cuffed ETT (MallinckrodtTM;&#xD;
      Covidien) sizes 5 mm ID and over. ETT was mounted on a FOS and secured near the proximal end&#xD;
      close to the eyepiece. With head maintained in neutral position, a lubricated FOS was then&#xD;
      advanced through the right or left nostril (the one that looked bigger) into the larynx and&#xD;
      once in the trachea, the lubricated ETT was advanced over it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An unblinded anesthesia attending associated with the study prepared the FOS and ETT&#xD;
      according to the randomization, and advanced the FOS into the trachea and the ETT into the&#xD;
      posterior pharynx. The anesthesia provider advancing the ETT was always one of the trainees:&#xD;
      student nurse anesthetists (SRNA) or resident who was not a part of the study and was blinded&#xD;
      to whether or not the ETT has been rotated 90°counterclockwise. The attending member of the&#xD;
      research team observed as the ETT was advanced by the trainee and made a note of whether or&#xD;
      not the ETT got hung up. If it did, the research team member withdrew the ETT 2 cm, rotated&#xD;
      it 90° CCR, and allowed the trainee to advance the ETT one or more times, noting the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following parameters would be measured:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data: age, weight, sex, nostril used and FOS size used; Whether or not ETT got&#xD;
      hung-up at the laryngeal inlet, Whether or not 90° counterclockwise rotation was helpful with&#xD;
      ETT advancement through the larynx and number of attempts needed to successfully advance the&#xD;
      ETT after the 90° CCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of resistance to tube advancement (hung-up ETT):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Steady but gentle force is generally needed to advance an ETT over the FOS, first through the&#xD;
      nose and then into the trachea through the larynx. If the ETT were to pass smoothly no change&#xD;
      in force is generally needed as it goes through the larynx. During advancement over the FOS,&#xD;
      if ETT came to an abrupt stop and then the same steady force was insufficient to advance the&#xD;
      ETT through the larynx it was defined as &quot;hung up&quot;. If sudden resistance to passage through&#xD;
      the larynx was encountered indicating that the ETT is hung up at the laryngeal inlet, it was&#xD;
      then withdrawn about 2 cm, rotated 90° counterclockwise and readvanced through the larynx and&#xD;
      observation was made if CCR maneuver leads to smoother passage of the ETT through the larynx&#xD;
      into the trachea without it getting hung-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: The data will be analyzed in the following manner: Nominal data such as&#xD;
      gender, nostril used and FOS size compared between the groups using Fisher's exact test and&#xD;
      numeric data such as age and weight with independent sample t-test. Outcome data such as&#xD;
      presence or absence of resistance due to hung up ETT will be analyzed with Chi square while&#xD;
      number of attempts will be analyzed with t-test. Significance was assumed at P&lt; 0.05.&#xD;
