  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clozapine (CLZ) is the most effective antipsychotic for treatment-refractory schizophrenia&#xD;
      (SZ). Despite the overwhelming evidence of superior efficacy, CLZ is infrequently prescribed&#xD;
      in the US, at a considerably lower rate than the estimated prevalence of treatment-resistant&#xD;
      SZ, especially for African-Americans (AA). Recent evidence suggests that low Absolute&#xD;
      Neutrophil Counts (ANC), either at baseline or during treatment are a significant barrier to&#xD;
      CLZ use in AA patients in the US, where guidelines mandate CLZ discontinuation if ANC drops&#xD;
      below 1500 cells/mm3. The investigators group has found that discontinuation of CLZ in AA&#xD;
      patients is over twice that in European-American (EA) patients (N~400; 42% vs.19%, P=0.041)&#xD;
      and initiation rates are 50% lower. In a Statewide study (N=1875), the investigators reported&#xD;
      that discontinuation was more frequently due to neutropenia in the AA sample, though no AA&#xD;
      had developed agranulocytosis (8 cases in EA). Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) in people of&#xD;
      African ancestry, including AAs, identifies a group (50% of AA) with low ANCs but no&#xD;
      increased risk of agranulocytosis or infection. Low baseline or in-treatment fluctuations&#xD;
      requiring CLZ discontinuation under current prescribing guidelines are common in CLZ-treated&#xD;
      persons with BEN. In the investigators recent pilot study of N=12 AA patients with BEN,&#xD;
      treatment was safely and successfully continued with CLZ despite low baseline ANC (outside&#xD;
      current guidelines). Recent evidence implicates a polymorphism in the Duffy Antigen Receptor&#xD;
      Chemokine (DARC) gene in the pathophysiology of BEN. In homozygotes (FY-/-) for the DARC null&#xD;
      allele, mean within-subject neutrophil counts are reduced, resulting in sporadic ANC &lt;1500&#xD;
      cells/mm3 in 10-15% of people with the allele. In population studies, the FY-/- genotype is&#xD;
      found in 0.01% of EAs, 99.3% of sub-Saharan Africans (SSA), and 68% of AAs. Further, a&#xD;
      missense DARC mutation has been reported to interact with the DARC FY-/- in determining low&#xD;
      WBC in AAs. Normal patterns of week-to-week fluctuation in ANC levels in individuals of&#xD;
      African ancestry with BEN and the DARC null genotype are not known, and no published research&#xD;
      has examined variation in ANC in African ancestry CLZ-treated SZ patients with BEN and the&#xD;
      DARC null genotype (FY-/-). Such data are also lacking on individuals with BEN without the&#xD;
      DARC null genotype. Conducting such research will generate genetic marker and safety data&#xD;
      that could be used to expand access to CLZ for AA patients who otherwise are eligible to&#xD;
      receive this superior treatment option.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible and recommended for clozapine treatment (e.g. treatment resistant&#xD;
             schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, other psychotic disorder,&#xD;
             delusional disorder, hostility, other documented rationale)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or Female&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  African Ancestry (African, African-American or African-Caribbean). This population&#xD;
             will make up the majority of the study. However, there are cases of BEN in individuals&#xD;
             of Middle Eastern, Caucasian, and other ethnicity. The investigators will accept these&#xD;
             patients as they may have unknown African ancestry and genotyping will be important.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age: 18 to 64 years.&#xD;
