      This study will explore the feasibility of initiating a uterine transplant program at UNMC.&#xD;
      Using the procedural templates established by a successful Swedish team, the investigators&#xD;
      will identify emotionally and socially stable females of reproductive age with intact ovaries&#xD;
      who are unable to gestate a child due to congenital or acquired uterine factor infertility&#xD;
      (UFI). Women will be 21 to 35 years of age upon entry into the protocol, with normal ovarian&#xD;
      reserve and otherwise healthy for pregnancy. After careful screening, participants will&#xD;
      undergo egg harvest, in-vitro fertilization, and embryo cryopreservation using standard&#xD;
      methods. Women who successfully complete in vitro fertilization and cryopreservation of at&#xD;
      least six embryos will be eligible to receive implantation of a deceased donor uterus. After&#xD;
      a period of observation to ensure normal menstrual cycling and graft viability, embryo&#xD;
      implantation will be undertaken. Gestations will be carefully monitored by our high-risk&#xD;
      pregnancy specialists. Medical research interventions include uterine harvest from a deceased&#xD;
      donor, surgical implantation of the organ utilizing standard transplant techniques, careful&#xD;
      post-transplant follow-up including immune suppression therapy tailored to minimize fetal&#xD;
      compromise, and careful management of pregnancy. After childbearing is complete (at most two&#xD;
      gestations), the donor uterus will be removed. In addition, open-ended interviews and written&#xD;
      surveys will be conducted to elicit ethical and psychosocial concerns arising from the&#xD;
      experience of subjects and their families, health care providers, and the wider community.&#xD;
      The investigators intent is to monitor outcomes lifelong for transplant recipients and&#xD;
      live-born infants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Uterine transplantation was developed as a surgical/medical procedure to ameliorate the&#xD;
      condition of absolute uterine factor infertility. As a condition, the congenital or acquired&#xD;
      state renders fertile-age women the inability to have a child via conventional birth. It is&#xD;
      estimated that this condition may affect near 1 in 500 women. The alternative, namely&#xD;
      gestational surrogacy or adoption, can be fraught with legal, ethical, or religious issues.&#xD;
      Significant research and progress has been obtained in Europe (namely Sweden) in facilitating&#xD;
      uterine transplantation. Recently, they were able to obtain a successful live childbirth&#xD;
      using a donated uterus from a living relative. Based on significant background research&#xD;
      already performed, the aim of this research study is to expand upon their gains by&#xD;
      successfully establishing a deceased donor uterus transplantation program at UNMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the success of the Swedish team, two other European/Asian medical research groups&#xD;
      have attempted deceased donor uterus transplantation. The first resulted in organ failure&#xD;
      from unclear pathology. The second was a successful transplant, but failed to yield a&#xD;
      childbirth due to multiple miscarriages. In 2004 however, the team from the Sahlgrenska&#xD;
      Institute in Gothenburg instituted a rigorous research undertaking in order to study the&#xD;
      phenomenon and to obtain a childbirth. Using established immunological knowledge, and&#xD;
      practical experience using animal models, the investigators were able over a course of a&#xD;
      decade, to start an active transplant program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a medical/obstetrics and gynecology standpoint, potential subjects were screened using a&#xD;
      rigorous physical and psychosocial evaluation. This involved meeting with multiple members of&#xD;
      the research team, in addition to independent monitors familiar with the field and the risks&#xD;
      and benefits of participation. To facilitate success, all women and their partners underwent&#xD;
      investigation to rule out any sterility factors that could have been related to fertility.&#xD;
      Next, egg harvesting and embryo transfer was undertaken according to currently accepted&#xD;
      protocols. Of note, all women who had uterine agenesis had some type of neo-vaginal&#xD;
      recreation in order to facilitate IVF. Finally, donor and recipient HLA matching was done&#xD;
      using standard transplantation methods in order to avoid unacceptable matches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During surgery, the donor underwent an extensive procedure in order to successfully dissect&#xD;
      out the artery and venous supply of the organ. The vagina was transected caudal to the&#xD;
      fornix, thus allowing a donor specimen which was attached by only the vascular pedicles. (The&#xD;
      process of removing a uterus from a living donor is infinitely more complex than that of a&#xD;
      deceased donor, hence our initial plan at UNMC is to focus on organs derived from the&#xD;
      latter.) Once the organ was removed, it was flushed with preservation solution using standard&#xD;
      transplantation protocols. The recipient surgery was also performed in standard fashion, with&#xD;
      the donor iliac vessels anastomosed to the recipients. The vaginal rim of the graft was&#xD;
      sutured to the recipient's vagina in standard fashion. Routine intra-operative examinations&#xD;
      with Doppler (to assess blood flow) were then performed prior to the termination of the&#xD;
      operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance immunosuppression was given to the recipients using standard accepted protocols&#xD;
      with close monitoring of drug levels. Serial Doppler US were done both during hospitalization&#xD;
      and in follow up to assess uterine viability. Clinical examination from an obstetrician was&#xD;
      performed at pre-determined intervals and biopsies of uterine tissue were taken to assess for&#xD;
      organ viability and to rule out rejection. Those few patients who did have rejection were&#xD;
      treated with standard transplantation protocols with increased steroids only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Embryo transfer was done at approximately 1 year post transplant, in order to ensure&#xD;
      continued viability and normal menstruation of the organ. Post transfer, hormonal stimulation&#xD;
      was done using standard reproductive endocrinology protocols. Serial monitoring of the fetus&#xD;
      was done at routine intervals through the 9 month gestational period. Finally, a caesarean&#xD;
      section was performed in routine fashion at time of birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our groups rationale at UNMC is to continue to build on the accepted protocols developed by&#xD;
      the Swedish team and apply them to deceased donors. The investigators believe our vast&#xD;
      experience in transplant and obstetrics/gynecology combined with reproductive endocrinology&#xD;
      facilitates undergoing this exciting new medical and surgical therapy.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For transplantation, the criteria are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Female of reproductive age with intact native ovaries and no medical&#xD;
                  contraindication to transplantation, including surgical procedure and subsequent&#xD;
                  immunosuppression, and no medical contraindication to reproduction and gestation&#xD;
                  in a transplanted uterus. Evaluation for a medical contraindication will be&#xD;
                  determined by a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at UNMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Diagnosed with either congenital or acquired uterine factor infertility (UFI) and&#xD;
                  counseled about alternate options for family building including gestational&#xD;
                  surrogacy and/or adoption and provided access to these alternate services.&#xD;
                  Acquired circumstances may include nonfunctional uterus and hysterectomy due to&#xD;
                  benign disease (uterine fibroids, Asherman's syndrome, pelvic infection,&#xD;
                  postpartum hemorrhage) or gynecologic malignancy of the uterus or cervix.&#xD;
                  Additionally, UFI may be a result of congenital anomaly of the uterus and uterine&#xD;
                  agenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. If uterine removal was for uterine or cervical cancer a minimum 5 year&#xD;
                  recurrence-free time period will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. If MRKH Syndrome (Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser) or Mullerian agenesis is&#xD;
                  present, the patient has a negative evaluation for other relevant congenital&#xD;
                  abnormalities (such as a pelvic kidney). Additionally, women with Mulllerian&#xD;
                  agenesis who have absence of the vagina must have had neovaginal creation surgery&#xD;
                  prior to uterine transplant in order to allow for embryo transplantation and&#xD;
                  monitoring of the organ after transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Ovaries are intact with adequate ovarian reserve as determined by accepted&#xD;
                  markers including anti-Mullerian hormone level (AMH), astral follicle count&#xD;
                  and/or early follicular follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Desires a biological child and is unable or unwilling to consider gestational&#xD;
                  surrogacy, and / or seeks uterine transplantation as a means to experience&#xD;
                  gestation, with an understanding of the limitations provided by the uterine&#xD;
                  transplant in this respect.&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Meets psychological evaluation criteria, e.g.,stable, committed relationship with&#xD;
                  an individual who supports uterine transplant and intends to co-parent;&#xD;
                  emotionally mature with good coping skills and no significantly adverse mental&#xD;
                  health history; normal intellect allowing careful analysis of risks and benefits;&#xD;
                  no evidence of coercion; no significant evidence of previous noncompliance with&#xD;
                  medical care; no evidence of frank unsuitability for motherhood (e.g., previous&#xD;
                  conviction for child abuse).&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Likely to comply with medical management, including antirejection immune&#xD;
                  suppression, frequent follow-up with surgical team, time-sensitive reproductive&#xD;
                  endocrinology management, high-risk pregnancy management, possible high-risk&#xD;
                  neonatal management.&#xD;
&#xD;
               9. Likely to be able to accommodate potential adverse outcomes such as loss of&#xD;
                  graft, inability to conceive, loss of pregnancy, adverse fetal or neonatal&#xD;
                  outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
              10. Willing to consider transplant hysterectomy or termination of pregnancy if&#xD;
                  medically necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
              11. Willing to undergo oocyte harvest and in-vitro fertilization prior to&#xD;
                  transplantation, with at least six viable embryos cryopreserved in anticipation&#xD;
                  of post-transplant implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
              12. Financially able to cover anticipated expenses of assisted reproductive services,&#xD;
                  either through third party coverage or through personal assets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For transplantation: Exclusions include genetic males, and women who do not meet the&#xD;
             inclusionary criteria above. Residence in the greater Omaha area during the&#xD;
             implantation and pregnancy period is required because of the time-sensitive nature of&#xD;
             transplantation and assisted reproductive technology, as well as the frequent medical&#xD;
             monitoring which will be required of transplant subjects.&#xD;
