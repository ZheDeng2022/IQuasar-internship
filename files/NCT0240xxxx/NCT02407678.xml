  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The assessment of the efficacy (with respect to preservation of visual function and retinal&#xD;
      structure) and safety of a single subretinal injection of AAV2.REP1 in participants with a&#xD;
      confirmed diagnosis of choroideremia, as evaluated by various functional and anatomical&#xD;
      outcomes measured over a number of time points up to 24 months post-treatment.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The decision about which eye to treat will be made on clinical grounds and will generally be the worse eye affected in cases where BCVA differs between the two eyes by 2 lines or more of ETDRS letters. The eye to be treated will be randomised in cases where the degeneration is relatively symmetrical between the two eyes, defined as:&#xD;
a difference in BCVA of no more than 1 line of ETDRS letters, and&#xD;
no more than 25% difference in the area of surviving RPE as measured by fundus autofluorescence.&#xD;
Prospective participants having non-symmetrical retinal degeneration will be allocated to the non-randomised arm. The treated eye will generally be the worse eye. Prospective participants having relatively symmetrical retinal degeneration will be allocated to the randomised arm.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>None (Open Label)</masking>
    <masking_description>The study is designated as Open Label with no masking. However, in order to minimise bias evaluation of the treated eye and untreated fellow eye (control eye), the ophthalmic assessments (visual acuity, microperimetry, fundus autofluorescence, etc.) will be conducted by an appropriately qualified masked observer once the participant's treated eye has had time to heal after the surgical procedure and has regained its normal appearance and function.</masking_description>
