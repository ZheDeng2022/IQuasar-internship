    <textblock>
      This year, 90,000 Americans with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) will die and questions will&#xD;
      legitimately be raised as to whether terminal treatment and location of death adequately&#xD;
      represented their preferences. These concerns are linked by a failure on the part of patients&#xD;
      and staff to discuss prognosis and share in end-of-life (EOL) planning. The rate of hospice&#xD;
      use among patients dying with ESRD is half that of the national average and one-quarter the&#xD;
      rate for patients with terminal cancer. In other patient populations when meaningful EOL&#xD;
      conversation occurs this is associated with increased hospice referral and improved quality&#xD;
      of the dying.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receiving hemodialysis (HD) often desire but rarely communicate with staff about&#xD;
      prognoses, know little about availability of community hospice resources, or how to complete&#xD;
      advance directives. Nephrologists are not trained to have these conversations, and although&#xD;
      accustomed to relying on interdisciplinary teams, they are unaccustomed to collaborating with&#xD;
      community hospices. Our preliminary research began by using focus groups, created and&#xD;
      validated the first clinically useful HD prognostic tool, and developed a prototype for&#xD;
      Shared Decision Making and Renal Supportive Care (SDM-RSC). This is a novel multimodal&#xD;
      intervention that familiarizes patients, families, and dialysis staff with community hospice&#xD;
      resources, emphasizes dialysis social work support, conveys information about terminal care&#xD;
      issues, and encourages advance care planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study tests the central hypothesis that EOL care can be improved by relying on&#xD;
      patients and stakeholders to enhance SDM-RSC for HD patients who are most likely to die. It&#xD;
      will test whether an intervention that targets communication deficiencies can alter EOL&#xD;
      outcomes and achieve the goal of matching patient preferences with terminal treatments.&#xD;

      of the dying.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receiving hemodialysis (HD) often desire but rarely communicate with staff about&#xD;
      prognoses, know little about availability of community hospice resources, or how to complete&#xD;
      advance directives. Nephrologists are not trained to have these conversations, and although&#xD;
      accustomed to relying on interdisciplinary teams, they are unaccustomed to collaborating with&#xD;
      community hospices. Our preliminary research began by using focus groups, created and&#xD;

      intervention that familiarizes patients, families, and dialysis staff with community hospice&#xD;
      resources, emphasizes dialysis social work support, conveys information about terminal care&#xD;
      issues, and encourages advance care planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study tests the central hypothesis that EOL care can be improved by relying on&#xD;
      patients and stakeholders to enhance SDM-RSC for HD patients who are most likely to die. It&#xD;
      will test whether an intervention that targets communication deficiencies can alter EOL&#xD;
      outcomes and achieve the goal of matching patient preferences with terminal treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether SDM-RSC impacts the use of hospice services, location of death, and&#xD;
           EOL planning. The RSC intervention will be employed at the HD clinics with patients who&#xD;
           are in the highest quintile of mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis: SDM-RSC will increase a) hospice use, b) deaths at home (vs. in&#xD;
           institutions), and c) completion of advance directives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the effect of SDM- RSC on quality of life/death and caregiver satisfaction&#xD;
           with patient care in the last week of life. Validated instruments reflecting values and&#xD;
           priorities of patient and caregiver will be collected by interviewers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: SDM-RSC will significantly improve quality of life/death while also increasing&#xD;
      caregiver satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed work addresses recommendations by the Renal Physician's Association for EOL care&#xD;
      and the Institute of Medicine for patient-centered healthcare. The novel communication&#xD;
      intervention is relevant to not only ESRD but also other high-mortality disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scope of the Problem:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A match between patient goals and the care received should be the gold standard for quality&#xD;
      medical management. Meaningful end-of-life (EOL) conversations are associated with increased&#xD;
      hospice referral, less aggressive and expensive medical treatment, and improved satisfaction&#xD;
      on the part of families. However, a survey of ESRD patients reported less than 10% having a&#xD;
      conversation about any EOL issues with their nephrologist in the previous year, and more than&#xD;
      90% endorsed that none of their physicians had ever discussed how much time they had to live.&#xD;
      It is not known whether an intervention that targets deficiencies in communication and&#xD;
      terminal care planning can improve EOL outcomes. This is an area that has been neglected in&#xD;
      ESRD research, yet should have tremendous importance to patients, families, and&#xD;
      policy-makers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over 600,000 Americans have ESRD at a cost to society of more than $42 billion a year, and&#xD;
      patients over the age of 75 constitute the fastest growing segment of the ESRD population in&#xD;
      the United States. Up to one-third of these elderly patients have four or more comorbid&#xD;
      chronic health conditions, and hemodialysis (HD) does not always substantially prolong their&#xD;
      lives. This year, Wong and associates reported that 49% of elderly long-term HD patients&#xD;
      spent time in an ICU in their final month of life, compared with 24% of cancer patients,&#xD;
      suggesting intensity of care at the EOL is substantially higher in ESRD than that received by&#xD;
      other Medicare beneficiaries with life-limiting illnesses. According to analyses from the&#xD;
      United States Renal Data System, these decisions may have important economic ramifications.&#xD;
      This figure demonstrates that the costs of care in the last week of life for those using&#xD;
      hospice and withdrawing from dialysis was approximately half the cost of those who did&#xD;
      neither. In light of the substantial prevalence of symptoms, costs, and high mortality rates,&#xD;
      it is time to reconsider the care, and especially the EOL care, offered to the ESRD&#xD;
      population with advancing age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Communication of prognosis is a key step in EOL planning, but occurs infrequently or&#xD;
      extremely late in the dying process among patients with ESRD. Most ESRD patients want to&#xD;
      learn about EOL issues, and according to Davison, the most valued components are being&#xD;
      informed about prognosis, treatment options (including withdrawal from dialysis) and planning&#xD;
      for death. In two studies, 95% and 97% of patients with ESRD preferred to be given&#xD;
      life-expectancy information-even if their prognosis was poor-and patients specifically wanted&#xD;
      their physician to disclose this information without prompting. Nevertheless, nephrologists&#xD;
      and dialysis staff infrequently discuss EOL issues with patients and families, although they&#xD;
      repeatedly face difficult determinations about treatment options, including whether to&#xD;
      discontinue renal replacement therapies or to consider referral for hospice services. Despite&#xD;
      national guidelines and an explicit recommendation by the Renal Physicians Association and&#xD;
      American Society of Nephrology, patients and their family members or surrogate decision&#xD;
      makers are often not provided with available information. This may help explain why only&#xD;
      one-in-five dying dialysis patients currently receive hospice care-about half that of&#xD;
      national figures for overall deaths in the United States and one-fourth that of people dying&#xD;
      from cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both uncertainty regarding individual prognosis and a lack of training in communicating has&#xD;
      limited EOL discussions between nephrologists and ESRD patients. Instruments to identify&#xD;
      individuals undergoing maintenance HD who are at highest risk for death have only recently&#xD;
      been shown to be reliable predictive models for clinical use. Integrated prognostic models&#xD;
      now take into account laboratory values, comorbidities, changes in comorbidity score over&#xD;
      time, functional status/fragility, quality of life (QOL), and sometimes either the patient's&#xD;
      or clinician's prediction of survival. Drs. Cohen and Germain have developed a practical and&#xD;
      reliable instrument that is available online (http://touchcalc.com/calculators/sq), as a free&#xD;
      application for mobile devices and it is being increasingly cited for its potential value in&#xD;
      the literature. In addition to the barriers of providing a reliable prognosis, communication&#xD;
      has been highlighted as a barrier in a qualitative study of elderly ESRD patients and&#xD;
      nephrologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Communication of prognosis may be an essential ingredient in the acceptance of life-limiting&#xD;
      conditions, completion of advance directives, do-not-resuscitate orders, and the delineation&#xD;
      of goals of care. However, nephrologists and dialysis staff have lacked training to&#xD;
      meaningfully participate in these complex but much needed conversations. In recent years,&#xD;
      guidelines have become available to assist medical personnel in communicating 'bad news' and&#xD;
      introducing hospice and other EOL resources to patients and families in an honest and&#xD;
      compassionate manner. Patients who talk with their physicians about approaching death are&#xD;
      more satisfied with care than those who do not, and they also frequently request deaths take&#xD;
      place at home. These results are consistent with other studies, suggesting that EOL&#xD;
      communication between patients and physicians is associated with better outcomes, less&#xD;
      expensive medical care, and decreased anxiety and depression on the part of the bereaved&#xD;
      survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have identified a major barrier in the management of dialysis patients: the dearth of&#xD;
      communication between staff and patients about prognosis and EOL considerations. Without&#xD;
      these conversations, this population will continue to receive overly demanding and expensive&#xD;
      treatments, infrequent referrals for hospice services, and a diminished quality of life and&#xD;
      death. The extensive preliminary work preceding this study, which began with focus groups&#xD;
      involving patients and families, has allowed us to develop and validate an accurate&#xD;
      prognostic instrument for the identification of HD patients with poor short-term survival&#xD;
      expectancy. The multimodal SDM-RSC intervention takes advantage of the existing&#xD;
      interdisciplinary team approach that is the bedrock of HD practice, and it empowers the&#xD;
      social worker to engage in EOL communication with the patients and their loved ones. The&#xD;
      SDM-RSC intervention is designed to be practical, adaptable to existing staff, and easily&#xD;
      replicated in dialysis facilities throughout the country. Additional involvement of&#xD;
      patient-partners from two distinct sections of the country will greatly improve the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal supportive care holds the promise of becoming an increasingly important and desirable&#xD;
      aspect of patient-centered care in ESRD. The principal elements of SDM-RSC include:&#xD;
      identification of high-mortality patients, initiating discussions with them and families,&#xD;
      sharing decision-making and advance care planning to establish agreed level of care, and when&#xD;
      appropriate changing the emphasis from curative to palliative treatments, such as withdrawal&#xD;
      of dialysis and referral for hospice services. This study intends to challenge the current&#xD;
      paradigm of EOL care of ESRD patients and establish whether delivery of prognostic&#xD;
      information, encouragement of advance directives, and sensitive discussion of terminal&#xD;
      treatment options, e.g. hospice services, by nephrologists and dialysis social workers, can&#xD;
      together meaningfully alter the last remaining portion of patient lives and the care they&#xD;
      receive. The trial will confront the issue of overuse-when an appropriate service, e.g. HD,&#xD;
      continues to be provided under circumstances in which the potential for harm may exceed the&#xD;
      possible benefit. Furthermore, the proposed trial may significantly improve the QOL of&#xD;
      patients and provide the opportunity for higher quality care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief Overview of SDM-RSC Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study utilizes a prospective intervention period and a retrospective control period at&#xD;
      the same dialysis units, in order to balance efficacy, power, and accuracy. The intervention&#xD;
      will be implemented at the unit level and is intended to impact not only the specific&#xD;
      patients enrolled in the study but also other patients receiving care in these units. The&#xD;
      design avoids the contamination effect and inadvertent cross-overs that would be present with&#xD;
      an individual participant randomization design. Because we expect perceptions and practices&#xD;
      to be changed among care providers other designs, e.g. cross-over designs, would also be&#xD;
      unusable. Cluster randomization may also not be practical given the variation between units&#xD;
      in practice patterns and logistics involved in conducting a study with a sufficient number of&#xD;
      dialysis to maintain internal validity. The design may be open to potential selection bias&#xD;
      and secular trends. Adjustments for these are discussed in the data analysis section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will test whether the SDM-RSC intervention compared to usual care improves EOL&#xD;
      care, including: increased hospice use, enhanced EOL planning, and improved patient and&#xD;
      caregiver satisfaction. The multi-modal SDM-RSC intervention communicates prognosis in a&#xD;
      face-to-face encounter, uses an algorithm-based social work intervention, and provides&#xD;
      hospice outreach. This study will be recruiting subjects from 16 dialysis units associated&#xD;
      with 2 clinical centers-Baystate-Tufts (8), University of New Mexico (8). The study sample&#xD;
      will be selected using a validated prognostic tool to enrich the pool of patients who have a&#xD;
      high risk of mortality and are most likely to benefit from the SDM-RSC intervention. Subjects&#xD;
      will be recruited over 6 months and enrolled subjects will be treated and followed for at&#xD;
      least 18 months.&#xD;
