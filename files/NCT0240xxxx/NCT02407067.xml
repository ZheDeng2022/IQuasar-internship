      This study will compare two types of assistive devices for communication (a voice amplifier&#xD;
      and a personal communication system) in individuals with a speech disorder related to&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease. The performance of these two devices will be examined with measures of&#xD;
      speech intelligibility and patient questionnaires and rating scales.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The proposed study will involve a comparison of 2 types of communication devices that are&#xD;
      approved for use in individuals with communication disorders. One of the devices, the voice&#xD;
      amplifier, is frequently prescribed for individuals with Parkinson's disease and should be&#xD;
      considered as part of the standard care for the symptom of low speech intensity in this&#xD;
      disorder. The other device is frequently prescribed for individuals with hearing impairment&#xD;
      (unrelated to Parkinson's disease) but is not considered to be part of the standard of care&#xD;
      for individuals with Parkinson's disease. This clinical study will use a crossover design in&#xD;
      which the participants will receive both devices, one after the other, and the order will be&#xD;
      randomized across the individuals. There is no control group or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include three groups of participants: 1) a PD participant group (n=20), 2) a&#xD;
      communication partner (CP) group (n=20), and 3) a na√Øve listener group (n=10). The PD&#xD;
      participant group will be comprised of individuals who have mild to moderate signs and&#xD;
      symptoms of idiopathic PD and hypophonia as confirmed by a neurologist. For all individuals&#xD;
      with PD, the speech testing will occur approximately one hour after taking their&#xD;
      antiparkinsonian medication according to their regular medication schedule. The communication&#xD;
      partner group will consist of individuals who regularly converse with the PD participant&#xD;
      (i.e. spouse or primary caregiver). The naive listener group will consist of students from&#xD;
      Western University. The participants with PD will wear a head-set microphone (AKG c520). The&#xD;
      speech intensity of the participants with PD will be calibrated with a sound level meter&#xD;
      (Luton SL-4001) placed 15cm from the mouth while the participant produces a steady 70dB A&#xD;
      prolonged &quot;ah&quot; for about 2 seconds. Two additional tripod-mounted microphones (Shure SM48)&#xD;
      will be placed 2 meters and 4 meters from the PD participant. The communication partner&#xD;
      participants will be seated approximately 30cm from these two microphones during the 2 and 4&#xD;
      meter interlocutor distance conditions. The output from the 3 microphones will be connected&#xD;
      to preamplifiers and a digitizing unit (M-Audio MobilePre) attached via a USB connection to a&#xD;
      PC computer running Praat recording and analysis software (Boersma &amp; Weenink, 2013). An&#xD;
      additional, fourth input line will be attached to the digitizing unit from the output of the&#xD;
      personal communication system when this device is being used in the study. All four audio&#xD;
      signals will be digitized at 44.1 kHz and 16 bits and stored as uncompressed .wav audio&#xD;
      files. The voice amplifier and personal communication system will be evaluated in random&#xD;
      order across the participants. The voice amplifier will be a ChatterVox. This amplifier&#xD;
      includes a headset microphone wired to a speaker/amplifier unit that is worn on a waist belt.&#xD;
      The ChatterVox was selected because it is a typical type of voice amplifier that is&#xD;
      frequently recommended and prescribed to individuals with PD in Ontario. Despite the paucity&#xD;
      of published voice amplifier studies of PD, the ChatterVox has been used in several published&#xD;
      studies of non-neurological voice disorders such as studies of elementary school teachers&#xD;
      with occupational-related voice problems (McCormick &amp; Roy, 2002; Roy et al. 2003). In&#xD;
      addition, a recent MSc thesis conducted at Western University by Monika Andreetta (supervised&#xD;
      by Professor Scott Adams) found that the ChatterVox was one of the best performing and&#xD;
      preferred devices in participants with PD when it was compared to 6 other voice amplifiers.&#xD;
      The personal communication system that will be evaluated is the Easy Listener FM system&#xD;
      (Phonic Ear Corp.). This system includes a light-weight, pocket-sized (2.5 x 9.4 x 5.6 cm; 80&#xD;
      grams) transmitter unit with a head-set microphone and a nearly identical, pocket-sized&#xD;
      receiver unit with a set of small headphones. These units can be carried in a breast-pocket&#xD;
      or attached to a waist-belt with a clip. The transmitter and receiver units are wireless and&#xD;
      communicate via an FM signal. The communication range of the units is approximately 30&#xD;
      meters. The PD participant will wear the transmitter/microphone unit and the communication&#xD;
      partner (CP) participant will wear the receiver/headphone unit. While there are several&#xD;
      personal communication systems that are available, the Easy Listener personal communication&#xD;
      system has been frequently prescribed and has been used in several previous studies of&#xD;
      individuals with hearing impairment (Schafer &amp; Thibodeau, 2004). During some of the&#xD;
      experimental conditions the PD and CP participants will be presented with 65dB A of&#xD;
      multi-talker noise (using a standard Audiotec Corp. Recording of 4-talker noise). The noise&#xD;
      will be presented from a computer via an audio amplifier and loudspeaker placed at 2 meters&#xD;
      from the participants. A sound level meter will be used to calibrate the noise level from the&#xD;
      loudspeaker. Procedures: Speech Tasks: Once one of the two devices has been attached to the&#xD;
      participant(s), the PD participant will be given a list of 6 sentences that were randomly&#xD;
      generated from the Sentence Intelligibility Test software. The PD participant will read aloud&#xD;
      each sentence and then pause while the communication partner (CP) participant attempts to&#xD;
      repeat aloud the sentence. The SIT provides intelligibility measures, which are commonly used&#xD;
      to document effectiveness in intervention programs or outcome studies (Beukelman et al.,&#xD;
      2007). Furthermore, most of the supportive research for the SIT was completed with dysarthric&#xD;
      speakers (Beukelman et al., 2007). After the list of 6 sentences are completed the PD&#xD;
      participant will be given several pictures of people engaged in various activities (i.e.&#xD;
      fishing, playing baseball, doing dishes, etc.) and the PD participant will make statements&#xD;
      that describe the pictures while the CP participant repeats aloud each of these statements.&#xD;
      This will continue until 6 statements (minimum of 5 words each) have been produced/repeated.&#xD;
      Speech Conditions: The speech tasks will be repeated with no device and while using each of&#xD;
      the two devices (ChatterVox voice amplifier and Easy Listener personal communication system)&#xD;
      in two noise conditions (none and 65dB multi-talker noise) and two interlocutor distances (2&#xD;
      and 4 meters). These conditions will be randomized. Rating Scale Procedures: Immediately&#xD;
      following the speech tasks the PD and CP participants will be asked to rate their experience&#xD;
      with the devices using visual analogue scales related to the following five parameters: 1.&#xD;
      Physical comfort: uncomfortable versus comfortable 2. Visual presentation: unacceptable&#xD;
      versus acceptable 3. Sound quality: poor sound quality versus good sound quality 4.&#xD;
      Amplification power: poor amplification versus good amplification 5. Overall preference: low&#xD;
      preference versus high preference The PD and CP participants will use the five visual&#xD;
      analogue scales to provide separate ratings for each of the two devices. Following the&#xD;
      completion of the rating scales the participants will be encouraged to provide additional&#xD;
      feedback about their impressions of the 2 devices. One Week Trial Periods: After the&#xD;
      completion of the lab-based speech and rating scale procedures the PD and CP participants&#xD;
      will be given instructions on the care and use of one of the two devices (i.e. recharging,&#xD;
      cleaning, volume adjustments, attachment, positioning, etc.) and then take the device home&#xD;
      for a one week trial period. The participants will be asked to use the device as often as&#xD;
      they desire but to use the device at least 3 times for a periods of at least one hour over&#xD;
      the course of the week. The participants will be given a Device Use Diary to write down the&#xD;
      dates, times, volume settings and contexts that they used the devices. The participants will&#xD;
      return after one week and complete questionnaires and rating scales related to their&#xD;
      experience and evaluation of the device. These will include the following: 1. Visual analogue&#xD;
      scales related to physical comfort, visual presentation, sound quality, amplification power,&#xD;
      and overall preference. 2. Speech Amplification Satisfaction Scale 3. Quebec User Evaluation&#xD;
      of Satisfaction with Assistive Technology Scale 4. Psychosocial Impact of Assistive Devices&#xD;
      Scale (PIADS). Following the completion of these questionnaires and ratings scales, the&#xD;
      participants will be given instructions on the use and care of the second device and then&#xD;
      take the device home for another one week trial period. The participants will be asked to use&#xD;
      the device as often as they desire but to use the device at least 3 times for a periods of at&#xD;
      least one hour over the course of the week. The participants will be given a Device Use Diary&#xD;
      to write down the dates, times, volume settings and contexts that they used the devices. The&#xD;
      participants will return after one week and again complete the previously described&#xD;
      questionnaires and rating scales related to their experience and evaluation of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Listening Tasks: Listener participants will listen to pre-recorded speech samples obtained&#xD;
      from the tripod-mounted microphones. Speech samples will be played in a randomized order.&#xD;
      Listeners will not be present at the time speech samples are recorded, and they will be&#xD;
      blinded to all information about the speakers and to the contents of the sentences from both&#xD;
      the SIT and picture description tasks prior to hearing them. Listeners will be seated at a&#xD;
      comfortable distance from a loudspeaker, which will be fixed at a comfortable predetermined&#xD;
      volume, and they will be asked to transcribe the data orthographically on prepared forms that&#xD;
      will be numbered to match the presentation order of the stimuli. The SIT software will&#xD;
      compute an intelligibility score by comparing transcribed words and sentences to the stimuli&#xD;
      on the master lists. For the picture description task, sentences will be transcribed&#xD;
      independently by the assessor and then compared to the listeners' transcriptions to determine&#xD;
      the intelligibility score.&#xD;
