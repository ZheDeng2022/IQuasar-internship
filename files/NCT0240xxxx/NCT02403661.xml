      The primary goal of this study is to quantify the functional deficits caused by injuries to&#xD;
      the brachial plexus and peripheral nerve in the arm. The second goal is to test the possible&#xD;
      benefit of electrical stimulation of the injured nerve following surgery. The investigators&#xD;
      will test whether electrical stimulation will improve hand function and nerve regeneration&#xD;
      after repair for nerve injury. Injuries causing nerve damage in the arm and hand are common.&#xD;
      In severe cases, functional outcomes even with surgery remain poor. Recently, electrical&#xD;
      stimulation has been applied to injured nerves in rats. This was shown to improve nerve&#xD;
      regeneration. These studies showed that as little as one hour of electrical stimulation was&#xD;
      effective. Therefore, the investigators plan to test this new method of treatment to&#xD;
      determine whether it is also helpful in humans. These will be done by using a symptom&#xD;
      severity questionnaire, nerve conduction studies and by testing pressure sensations, hand&#xD;
      dexterity and strength. The patients will be randomized to either the treatment or control&#xD;
      group. Following the treatment, all baseline measurements will be reevaluated every three&#xD;
      months for the first year and every 6 months during the second year. The timing and nature of&#xD;
      the evaluation process will be identical in both groups.&#xD;

      Background Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical repair and nerve grafting are currently the standard treatment for nerve laceration.&#xD;
      However, even with that, the functional outcome in patients with proximal nerve cut is often&#xD;
      poor. In those cases, the surviving axons in the proximal nerve stump have already reached&#xD;
      their capacity limit to sprout and to reinnervate. Therefore, no further reinnervation can&#xD;
      occur even with surgery unless regeneration and extension of the proximal stump can somehow&#xD;
      be enhanced. Unfortunately, although many attempts, none were shown to be effective in the&#xD;
      clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-surgical electrical stimulation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies demonstrated that electrical stimulation applied directly to an injured&#xD;
      peripheral nerve resulted in marked improvement of nerve regeneration. Preliminary data&#xD;
      suggesting that electrical nerve stimulation could possibly enhance nerve regeneration has in&#xD;
      fact been known for some time. Accelerated rate of regeneration was found in animals that&#xD;
      received electrical stimulation for as little as 1 hour. Furthermore, preferential growth of&#xD;
      the regenerating sensory axons into the appropriate nerve branch was also accelerated with&#xD;
      electrical stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since these studies showed that as little as one hour of electrical stimulation was effective&#xD;
      in accelerating nerve regeneration, it opens the possibility of applying this to humans. The&#xD;
      intervention is safe and of minimal discomfort. Furthermore, the use of electrical&#xD;
      stimulation as a clinical treatment modality is already well accepted. In a recent study, the&#xD;
      investigators applied this to patients with severe median nerve compressive injury in the&#xD;
      carpal tunnel following surgery. The procedure was well tolerated with no adverse event&#xD;
      observed in any of the 21 subjects after 1 year of follow up. In fact, compared to the&#xD;
      control subjects who received surgery alone, those in the treatment groups showed quicker&#xD;
      resolution of their symptoms and more vigorous motor nerve regeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The problem of prolonged denervation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prognosis following severe trauma to nerves in the upper arm and forearm, if left untreated,&#xD;
      is extremely poor. Current conventional treatment is through primary nerve repair and by&#xD;
      inserting a nerve graft (most commonly using the sural nerve) to restore nerve continuity.&#xD;
      However, even with that, the extent of reinnervation is often far from complete. The glacial&#xD;
      rate of nerve regeneration, at no more than 1 mm a day, can easily leave the target intrinsic&#xD;
      hand muscles deprived of nerve innervation for a year or more. The long period of&#xD;
      denervation, coupled with a lack of active movements can lead a whole host of negative&#xD;
      consequences including muscle fibre fibrosis, contracture, secondary joint derangement and&#xD;
      not infrequently, pain. Equally important is the Schwann cells' ability to support trophic&#xD;
      support and nerve growth guidance also gradually declines. Therefore, a more effective&#xD;
      treatment is urgently needed. A recent approach is by doing a distal nerve transfers. That&#xD;
      shortens the distance of reinnervation greatly. However, the outcome following this transfer&#xD;
      or with primary suture repair following acute median or ulnar nerve laceration is relatively&#xD;
      poor. Another closely related common trauma to the hand is laceration of digital nerves where&#xD;
      recovery of sensory functions following primary nerve suture is equally poor. To potentially&#xD;
      further expedite the reinnervation, the investigators proposed to additionally stimulate the&#xD;
      proximal nerve stump immediately following the nerve transfer and/or the nerve repair.&#xD;
      Whether this novel approach will indeed further expedite the reinnervation and improve hand&#xD;
      function following nerve laceration is not known at this point. This will be the first human&#xD;
      application study to address that question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis/Research Question/Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that nerve regeneration in the nerves in the arm and digital nerve&#xD;
      in the hand can be significantly enhanced when they are combined with post-surgical&#xD;
      electrical stimulation. Furthermore, the improved nerve regeneration with post-operative&#xD;
      electrical stimulation will result in a significant improvement in hand functions compared&#xD;
      with surgery alone.To test these hypotheses, the objectives of this study are to: 1) quantify&#xD;
      the functional and physiological consequence of severe nerve injury in the arm, and 2) to&#xD;
      compare the outcome of conventional nerve surgery alone versus nerve surgery followed by&#xD;
      post-operative electrical stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects Patients with severe trauma to the nerves in the upper limb resulting in complete&#xD;
      axonal loss will be recruited. These patients will be randomly assigned to either nerve&#xD;
      repair/transfer alone or nerve repair/transfer followed by one hour of low frequency&#xD;
      electrical stimulation. The patients will be followed at 3 month intervals for 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-surgical outcome including electrophysiological evaluation will be done by an&#xD;
      independent physician who is not part of the investigation team. Therefore, the testers will&#xD;
      not be aware of whether the subjects are in the conventional surgery group or in the&#xD;
      surgery+electrical stimulation group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once all the baseline studies have been completed, the subject will be randomized to one of&#xD;
      two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Surgery followed by sham stimulation for 5 seconds. Nerve repair/transfer surgery will be&#xD;
      performed by a peripheral nerve surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) Surgery followed by 1 hour of electrical stimulation. Electrical stimulation will be done&#xD;
      by inserting a pair of fine wires insulated all around except over the most distal 1 cm at&#xD;
      the tip through the incision site. Tips of the fine wires will be seated over the proximal&#xD;
      nerve stump to depolarize the axons. These fine wire electrodes will be connected to a&#xD;
      portable electrical stimulator (model SD9, Grass Instruments, Providence, RI, USA).&#xD;
      Continuous 20 Hz electrical stimuli will be delivered at an intensity of 1.5 times of motor&#xD;
      threshold for an hour. At this low intensity, there should be little if any discomfort with&#xD;
      the stimulation procedure. In a previous series of carpal tunnel syndrome patients carried&#xD;
      out at University of Alberta, this was found to be totally safe and well tolerated. The fine&#xD;
      wires will be removed once the stimulation protocol is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods of outcome evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sensory nerve conduction study to measure the sensory nerve action potential amplitudes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Motor nerve conduction study to measure the compound muscle action potential amplitudes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Motor unit number estimate. The 'multiple point stimulation' technique will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Light touch and pressure sensation. This will be tested using the Semmes-Weinstein&#xD;
           Monofilaments and McKinnon-Dellon Disk-Criminator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Hand function tests. This will be tested using Moberg Pick-Up Test, Purdue Pegboard&#xD;
           Test, Jamar dynamometer for grip strength, Pinch dynamometer for key, tripod and&#xD;
           tip-to-tip strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post intervention evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the intervention, all the baseline parameters will be reevaluated every 3 to 6&#xD;
      months for 2 years. The timing and nature of the evaluation procedure will be identical in&#xD;
      all the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Considerations in the study design Since this will be the first human application&#xD;
      study for nerve laceration on a novel technique, its results will be valuable in guiding&#xD;
      future full scale studies. The rationale for proposing a total 80 subjects in this study is&#xD;
      based on a recently completed study on using post surgical electrical stimulation to enhance&#xD;
      nerve regeneration in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome. In that randomized controlled&#xD;
      study, a similar sample size was used and the investigators found a significant improvement&#xD;
      in nerve regeneration in the treatment group compared to controls. Based on motor unit number&#xD;
      estimation, the primary outcome used, the treatment group showed a statistically significant&#xD;
      improvement compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis of changes in the outcome measure parameters within each subject will be&#xD;
      done using paired t-test. A p &lt;0.05 will be considered significant. Differences in treatment&#xD;
      outcome between the two groups will be done using independent t-test with the treatment&#xD;
      method being the independent variable.&#xD;
