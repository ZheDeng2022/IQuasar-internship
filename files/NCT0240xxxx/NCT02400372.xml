      The study, &quot;Evaluation of the effect of antibacterial medical honey dressing for healing of&#xD;
      implants donor area&quot;, is a Phase 4 Study, Prospective, A randomized trial, 3 arms (treatment&#xD;
      groups) trial, Open-label, non-controlled, non-randomized, Aims To test the effectiveness of&#xD;
      antibacterial medical honey dressing in the therapy of donor area of implants. In our&#xD;
      Research Will participate in 135 new patients over the age of 18, with a wound in the donor&#xD;
      area of hip implants, Hospitalized in the Plastic Surgery Unit of the &quot;Haemek&quot; Medical&#xD;
      Center. Appropriate patients, who will agree to sign and sign a consent form, be assigned&#xD;
      randomly to one of three treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The research group: Medihoney antibacterial wound dressing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The control group: Paraffin gauze with saline- The basic treatment in the donor site,&#xD;
           accepted the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Comparison group: Polymem dressing - Common treatment in the donor site in the Plastic&#xD;
           Surgery Unit of the &quot;Haemek&quot; Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the three study groups will be performed, each visit, Medical monitoring and&#xD;
      examination by a team of medical indices of Plastic Surgery Unit, as is customary. The&#xD;
      treatment will be performed, twice a week until recovery and the complete closure of the&#xD;
      wound.&#xD;

      Study protocol The aim of this study is to evaluate &quot;The effect of anti-bacterial honey&#xD;
      dressing on the healing of split thickness skin graft donor site&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol Abstract. The use of skin grafts for wound closure is considered one of the common&#xD;
      methods in the field of plastic surgery. Healing of the donor area is secondary, gradual and&#xD;
      is a serious problem, Associated with a high percentage of wound infections, Delay in&#xD;
      healing, Scars, Pain unpleasant odor and other problems. As of today, there is no ideal&#xD;
      treatment to cure the donor area of implants, due to lack of high-quality comparative&#xD;
      studies. The use of honey to treat wounds known for centuries in different cultures. Honey&#xD;
      has anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial effect, Debridement ability, and Pain relief. Honey&#xD;
      has almost no side effects. Effectiveness of honey in wound healing has been tested in many&#xD;
      clinical trials, but most of them and some methodological problems of low quality. Therefore,&#xD;
      it is difficult to conclude that the existing information handling guidelines and&#xD;
      recommending further clinical research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study, &quot;Evaluation of the effect of antibacterial medical honey dressing for healing of&#xD;
      implants donor area&quot;, is a Phase 4 Study, Prospective, A randomized trial, 3 arms (treatment&#xD;
      groups) trial, Open-label, non-controlled, non-randomized, Aims To test the effectiveness of&#xD;
      antibacterial medical honey dressing in the therapy of donor area of implants. In our&#xD;
      Research Will participate in 135 new patients over the age of 18, with a wound in the donor&#xD;
      area of hip implants, Hospitalized in the Plastic Surgery Unit of the &quot;Haemek&quot; Medical&#xD;
      Center. Appropriate patients, who will agree to sign and sign a consent form, be assigned&#xD;
      randomly to one of three treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The research group: Medihoney antibacterial wound dressing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The control group: Paraffin gauze with saline- The basic treatment in the donor site,&#xD;
           accepted the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Comparison group: Polymem dressing - Common treatment in the donor site in the Plastic&#xD;
           Surgery Unit of the &quot;Haemek&quot; Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the three study groups will be performed, each visit, Medical monitoring and&#xD;
      examination by a team of medical indices of Plastic Surgery Unit, as is customary. The&#xD;
      treatment will be performed, twice a week until recovery and the complete closure of the&#xD;
      wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Goals Primary goal Examining the effect of Medihoney antibacterial wound dressing&#xD;
      honey on the duration of the donor site area healing, until full recovery and wound closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To Evaluatee the effect of Medihoney antibacterial wound dressing on pain intensity&#xD;
           donor site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. . To Evaluatee the effect of Medihoney antibacterial wound dressing on the frequency of&#xD;
           infections in donor site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary goal&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the effect of Medihoney antibacterial wound dressing on the unpleasant odor&#xD;
           in the donor site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 2. To evaluate the effect of Medihoney antibacterial wound dressing on patient&#xD;
           satisfaction from treatment in donor site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypothesis Medihoney antibacterial wound dressing will find significantly&#xD;
      statistical more effective in comparison with Paraffin gauze with saline dressing and&#xD;
      compared with Polymem dressing, In terms of duration of a treatment, Intensity of pain and&#xD;
      the prevalence of infection in the donor site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment regimen First group Immediately after harvesting the skin, the donor site will be&#xD;
      covered with a thin layer of Medihoney Antibacterial Wound Gel and Xtrasorb Super Absorbent&#xD;
      Dressing will used as secondary dressing. After 24 hours, the dressing will be replaced by&#xD;
      Medihoney HCS dressing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medihoney HCS dressing will be replace twice a week.&#xD;
