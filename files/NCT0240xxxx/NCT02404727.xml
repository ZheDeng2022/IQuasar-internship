      The Elderly Hip Patient The proportion of elderly in the Danish population is increasing and&#xD;
      their and functional level is generally good, despite other health problems, which&#xD;
      intensifies the demand for a primary definitive (one-stage) and safe surgical treatment in&#xD;
      case of osteoarthritis or fragility low-energy displaced femoral neck fracture. Total hip&#xD;
      arthroplasty (THA) is one of the most successful procedures in modern orthopaedic surgery to&#xD;
      achieve pain relief and restore normal walking ability in a preoperative painful and stiff&#xD;
      hip joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone Quality and THA surgical technique Osteoporosis (brittle bones) is defined as a chronic&#xD;
      systemic skeletal disease characterized by low bone mineral density (osteopenia) and&#xD;
      microarchitecture changes in the trabecular bone structure resulting in reduced strength and&#xD;
      therefore increased risk of fractures. Among Danish women over 65 years of age, the&#xD;
      prevalence of osteoporosis is 40-60%, and the prevalence among men is increasing. Much effort&#xD;
      is put into secondary fracture prophylaxis such as vitamin D and calcium as well as medical&#xD;
      bone anti-resorptive treatment (i.e. bisphosphonates).&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the bone is weak/osteoporotic there is a general but undocumented recommendation of&#xD;
      cemented over uncemented THA fixation. It has been shown that uncemented hip stems migrate&#xD;
      more than cemented components in osteopenic and osteoporotic bone wherefore cemented stem&#xD;
      fixation is recommended. However, Danish hip surgeons favour uncemented fixation even in the&#xD;
      fragile and osteoporotic elderly because it reduces the surgical time, minimizes the risk of&#xD;
      intraoperative cement disease/fat embolism and dead, and makes revision surgery in case of&#xD;
      infection or peri-prosthetic fracture easier to re-operate. In 2012, 7364 acetabular cups&#xD;
      were inserted uncemented versus 1015 uncemented - for all indications for THA in Denmark.&#xD;
      Reoperation of the same hips within 2 years after primary THA due to new femoral neck&#xD;
      fracture or complications following treatment of proximal femoral fracture was 4.7 %. There&#xD;
      is clinical conviction that cemented cups are easier to place in the correct inclination and&#xD;
      anteversion position. However, due to the posterior-lateral overhang of dual mobility cups&#xD;
      the postero-lateral edge-cementation is likely to be insufficient leading to micromotion and&#xD;
      aseptic loosening. In the clinical experience this is a lesser risk with cementless cups.&#xD;
      Compared to other Nordic countries, Denmark has the lowest incidence of aseptic cup loosening&#xD;
      of 34.8% and respectively 47.3% and 50.4% for Norway and Sweden. The reason for revision due&#xD;
      to dislocation is 33.5% in Denmark compared to Norway and Sweden, respectively 23.8% and&#xD;
      23.4% and may be related to an overall difference in surgical approach (postero-lateral&#xD;
      approach in Denmark but antero-lateral approach in Norway and Sweden). Approximately 96% are&#xD;
      operated with posterior approach in Denmark whereas 23.8% and 60.3% were operated by&#xD;
      posterior approach in Norway and Sweden, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dual-mobility articulation concept In 1974 Professor Bousquet developed the dual-mobility&#xD;
      (DM) hip articulation concept to reduce wear, restore near-normal motion-range in the hip&#xD;
      joint, and at the same time increase hip prosthesis stability. The dual-mobility hip&#xD;
      articulation design consist of a large non-fixed polyethylene liner sliding freely within the&#xD;
      metal cup-shell which is fixed into the bone, and inside the mobile liner is a second&#xD;
      articulation with a small femoral head. The dual-articulation of the prosthetic joint&#xD;
      prevents impingement of the femoral neck on the acetabular rim of the implant. Studies have&#xD;
      shown that dual-mobility hip prostheses have good survival rates and reduces dislocation&#xD;
      rates both in patients with primary osteoarthritis of the hip and a lesser compliant patient&#xD;
      group with displaced femoral neck fractures . Clinical expectations for the dual-mobility&#xD;
      articulation concept for treatment of displaced medial FNF are good; however, there are only&#xD;
      a few publications available and there are no studies of implant fixation / cup migration. It&#xD;
      is important to study both the dislocation risk as well as the mechanical stability of the&#xD;
      bony fixation since the advantage of a low dislocation rate would be meaningless if the cups&#xD;
      were to loosen mechanically from the surrounding bone in the mid- or longer term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Femoral Neck Fracture and THA THA may be used as the primary treatment option for displaced&#xD;
      medial femoral neck fractures (FNF). Compared to screw osteosynthesis, THA results in a&#xD;
      stable fracture treatment with less post-operative pain and faster mobilization after&#xD;
      displaced medial FNF and with fewer complications. The most common complication to THA&#xD;
      treatment in old and perhaps memory-impaired patients is dislocation instability. At the&#xD;
      Regional Hospital Holstebro our results with the Saturne® Dual-Mobility THA in this patient&#xD;
      group (n&gt;500) during the last 7 years propose the risk of THA hip dislocation in high-risk&#xD;
      patients to be below 5%. In 2012, 10,309 patients were admitted to Danish hospitals with&#xD;
      femoral fractures. Approximately 600 of these hip fracture patients were treated with THA.&#xD;
      Patients with hip fractures are very resource intensive and require approximative 2.2% of all&#xD;
      hospital bed days in Denmark. Furthermore, these elderly, with an average age of 80 years and&#xD;
      a high co-morbidity percentage also have a high mortality risk of approximately 10% within&#xD;
      the first 30 days after FNF. The one-year mortality is 15-25%. Reoperations frequency depends&#xD;
      on the fracture type and operative treatment, and varies from a few per cent after insertion&#xD;
      of THA to 25% after osteosynthesis. Often it is the acute and chronic medical conditions that&#xD;
      cause the elderly to low energy falls resulting in hip fracture, but it may also just be&#xD;
      accidental and related to osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiostereometric Analysis (RSA) Mechanical loosening of the prosthesis may be suspected if&#xD;
      the prosthesis migrates relative to underlying and adjacent bone. Therefore, there is now a&#xD;
      consensus that the introduction of new prostheses and new operational methods of prosthesis&#xD;
      insertion should be evaluated through migration studies before they can be recommended for&#xD;
      use in general. Clinical studies have shown a high predictive power between early migration&#xD;
      of joint prostheses and later prosthesis loosening and premature revision. Radiostereometric&#xD;
      analysis (RSA) is a very accurate method for assessment of cup migration at precision levels&#xD;
      0.11 mm precision or better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) The clinical survival of joint prostheses depends on&#xD;
      the quality of the surrounding bone and bone mineral density (BMD) is an important measure of&#xD;
      bone strength and quality. The periprosthetic bone density can be measured with Dual Energy&#xD;
      X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA), which is a precise method for measuring even small changes in BMD&#xD;
      around hip prostheses. Patients are exposed to a very little dose of radiation with these&#xD;
      studies and scanning only takes a few minutes. Typically, four to five scans are taken during&#xD;
      a 2 to 5 year follow-up. For assessment of the bone surrounding the acetabular cup the 3&#xD;
      DeLee zones or the 4 Wilkinson Zones are often used, and Gruen zones are used for assesment&#xD;
      around the stem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone density is defined by a and in osteopenic bone the T-score is between &lt;1.0 - &gt; 2.5,&#xD;
      whereas when osteoporotic the T-score is &lt; 2.5 and severe osteoporosis &lt; 4.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible to register bone resorption around implants with DXA before resorption becomes&#xD;
      visible on conventional x-ray films in the form of &quot;radiolucent lines&quot; (RLL). It is important&#xD;
      to monitor remodelling in the periprosthetic bone because decreasing BMD may weaken the&#xD;
      prosthetic fixation and lead to failure. It is known that BMD decreases initially after&#xD;
      implant surgery and then stabilize after a periode of a few years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polywear The acetabular plastic component polyethylene (PE) wear particles stimulate a&#xD;
      biologic response with production of various inflammatory mediators, which stimulate&#xD;
      migration of leucocytes into tissues and activate collagen synthesis, and stimulate&#xD;
      osteoclasts to resorb bone and contribute to osteolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reports have suggested that hydroxyapatite (HA) coated implants that are used in cementless&#xD;
      hip replacements further contribute to inferior survival of medium- thickness spray-dried&#xD;
      HA-coated cups with individual cases of excessive PE wear and premature cup failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concept of the dual-mobility cup provides a theoretical question whether the double&#xD;
      articulations leads to more wear and hence earlier revision, especially in younger more&#xD;
      active patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has previously been shown that a two-dimentional (2D) wear of the polyethylene of 0.1 mm /&#xD;
      year may lead to osteolysis and loosening of the prosthetic components, which deteriorates&#xD;
      prosthesis durability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wear of hip prostheses polyethylene can be accurately measured (0.09 mm) with software&#xD;
      PolyWare 3D Pro Digital Version on digital clinical antero-posterior radiographs of the hip&#xD;
      prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and methods Comparison of prosthesis migration of cemented versus uncemented&#xD;
      dual-mobility cup fixation Objective: Investigate prosthesis migration and polyethylene wear&#xD;
      of cemented and cementless Avantage® dual-mobility acetabular components (Biomet Inc.) in&#xD;
      elderly patients and correlate migration measurements with radiological evaluation of implant&#xD;
      placement/cementation quality, with bone quality at the time of surgery&#xD;
      (osteoporotic/osteopenic/normal bone), and with functional outcome after two years. The&#xD;
      migration pattern and magnitude will predict the likelihood of later aseptic loosening and&#xD;
      revision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective randomized patient-blinded clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. More stable fixation of cemented compared with uncemented cups (initially and between&#xD;
           1-2 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Acceptable cement coverage at the postero-lateral acetabular rim in most (95%) of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Low polyethylene wear-rate (&lt;0.1mm/year after bedding-in during the first 3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Similar periprosthetic pelvic bone loss (Wilkinson zones) irrespective of fixation&#xD;
           method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Low dislocation risk irrespective of fixation method (&lt;1%).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Patient satisfaction &gt;90% in general.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Avantage® cup is used for all elderly patients on our department including patients with&#xD;
      displaced medial FNF and patients with primary osteoarthritis. It may also be used for&#xD;
      revision surgery in case of dislocation complications. Acute patients with FNF are difficult&#xD;
      to include in studies when some pre-study investigations are necessitated and further&#xD;
      patients with FNF are difficult to inform (pain and morphine drugged) and it is difficult to&#xD;
      give proper time to consider study participation and perhaps call for an assessor to help&#xD;
      make the decision. A big drop out due to difficult circumstances about project-information&#xD;
      and consent could be a serious selection bias and could also prolong the inclusion period&#xD;
      seriously. Mortality in FNF patients is high and poses a risk of many patients lost to&#xD;
      follow-up during a 5-year study period and therefore demands a high estimated sample size.&#xD;
      Therefore this study applies only to elderly elective patients with osteoarthritis scheduled&#xD;
      for elective THA. All patients &gt;70 years of age with osteoarthritis of the hip, who are&#xD;
      candidates for a total hip prosthesis, will be offered participation in the study. All&#xD;
      patients will be operated by one of two experienced hip surgeons and they will follow the&#xD;
      usual postoperative regime at Holstebro Regional Hospital (pain treatment, physiotherapy and&#xD;
      full weight bearing, thromboembolic and antibiotic prophylaxis). All eligible patients will&#xD;
      be registered, those who choose not to participate, will be asked for the reason of refusal,&#xD;
      to be able to detect possible selection bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INFORMED CONSENT The first contact is made in the outpatient clinic of orthopaedic department&#xD;
      of Regional Hospital Holstebro, where the patients will be seen by one of two orthopaedic&#xD;
      surgeons experienced in total hip replacement surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the first contact, the patients will receive oral and written information about the&#xD;
      study. During this contact it is possible for the patient to have an extra person along. If&#xD;
      requested by the patient/needed for decision-making concerning study participation, we will&#xD;
      offer second project information to the patient with the option to bring an assessor.&#xD;
      Patients can decide to participate in the study up to a week before surgery, where they will&#xD;
      come to the information day prior to surgery, which is a part of the normal fast-track&#xD;
      program. There is an average waiting period between first contact and surgery of 4 weeks,&#xD;
      which means that patients have 3 weeks to decide. Written informed consent will be obtained&#xD;
      before commencement of data collection, at the latest on the information day prior to&#xD;
      surgery. When the consent form is signed DXA scanning and filling out questionnaires will&#xD;
      commence, and post-operative stereoradiographs and DXA scans will be booked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be DXA scanned pre-operatively for measurements of general bone mineral&#xD;
      density and classification in a) normal bone, b) osteopenia) or c) osteoporosis. Patients&#xD;
      with a T-score above -2.5 (normal bone and osteopenic bone) will be grouped and patients with&#xD;
      a T-score at or below -2.5 and at or above - 4.0 will be grouped (osteoporosis). Patients&#xD;
      will be stratified to the two treatment modalities (cemented acetabular cup fixation and&#xD;
      cementless acetabular cup fixation) according to this dichotomy on T-score. Patients with a&#xD;
      new diagnosis of osteoporosis will be referred to their own general practitioner concerning&#xD;
      blood work and initiation of anti-resorptive treatment. On going medical treatment for&#xD;
      osteoporosis will be recorded. After stratification according to T-score, patients are&#xD;
      randomized during surgery with a cemented or cementless Avantage® dual-mobilty Cup (Biomet&#xD;
      Inc.) and patients will be blinded with respect to implant fixation method. The Avantage® Cup&#xD;
      can be inserted both cemented and uncemented where the cementless are HA coated and cemented&#xD;
      cups are fully polished. The liner is gamma irradiated to induce a high level of crosslinking&#xD;
      and Vitamin E is infused into the highly crosslinked polyethylene. A 28-mm chrome-cobalt&#xD;
      femoral head will be used in all cases. The femoral stems will be similar in all patients&#xD;
      (cemented Exeter stems, Stryker® Inc.) and Palacos® bone cement (Heraeus Medical inc.) will&#xD;
      be used. During surgery 1mm tantalum beads are inserted in the bone surrounding the&#xD;
      prosthetic components (both the femur and the cup) allowing for post-operative migration&#xD;
      measurements with RSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative, 3 months, 1 year, 2 years and 5 years after surgery the patients are followed&#xD;
      with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stereo radiographs (cup migration and polyethylene wear).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard radiographs (evaluation of cup position (PolyWare software) and evaluation of&#xD;
           cementation quality)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DXA scan at follow-up to measure changes in the peri prosthetic bone density (Wilkinson&#xD;
           Zones in the acetabulum and Gruen Zones around the stem).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of PROM (Osteoporosis risk assessment, Oxford Hip Score,EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D),&#xD;
           Harris Hip Score, VAS score at rest and activity).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Activity measurement with an accelerometer 2 weeks test prior to each control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power and data analysis: The proximal cup migration was used as the primary effect variable&#xD;
      in the pre-study power analysis based on a pilot study including both cemented and cementless&#xD;
      Avantage DM cups. Sample size calculation using two-sample mean test for a minimal relevant&#xD;
      difference of 0.2mm with a mean cup migration of 0.1mm and a standard deviation of 0.2 (pilot&#xD;
      study), power of 0.90, and 5% risk of type-1 error, 23 patients were needed in each group. To&#xD;
      compensate for potential dropouts, we decided to include 30 hips in each treatment arm.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints are polyethylene wear, activity, complications, and functional outcome by&#xD;
      clinical examination (HHS) and PROM (OHS, EQ5D). All of the applied methodologies are&#xD;
      available, accessible and validated at Holstebro Regional Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Helsinki II agreement will be followed. The study plan will be registered at&#xD;
      clinicaltrails.gov. Application for permission for a database will be submitted to the Data&#xD;
      Protection Agency of the region Midtjylland and data will be stored in accordance with&#xD;
      applicable law.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics and (dis) advantages for the patient There are only a few publications available on&#xD;
      implant fixation in elderly patients and currently only for fixation of the stem in patients&#xD;
      with normal bone or osteoporotic bone. There are no RSA studies available on the Avantage®&#xD;
      cup even though it is the standard cup in most Danish Orthopaedic Departments and one of the&#xD;
      cups available in the Middle Region Implant Supply. The Avantage® cup is available in a&#xD;
      similar design for cemented and cementless fixation principle. The dual-mobility concept is&#xD;
      well proven in different implant brands over 35 years with good results on revision and&#xD;
      dislocation (both very low) but no RSA studies on fixation are available. The current study&#xD;
      may therefore add important and new knowledge to the literature. It is important to study&#xD;
      both the dislocation risk as well as the mechanical stability of the bony fixation since the&#xD;
      advantage of a low dislocation rate would be meaningless if the cups were to loosen&#xD;
      mechanically from the surrounding bone in the mid- or longer term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will reveal insight into whether the cemented or the cementless fixation principle&#xD;
      is better for elderly patients and if there is a difference based on systemic and&#xD;
      periprosthetic bone mineral density. Furthermore compiled prosthesis migration with the bone&#xD;
      quality, accelerometer tests, and the incidence of complications that could contribute to the&#xD;
      improvement of hip prosthesis surgery to such an extent that clearly outweighs the side&#xD;
      effects associated with the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed using the fast-track program of the department, ensuring the same&#xD;
      length of stay for both groups, and no additional admission days are added as compared to&#xD;
      other patients who undergo hip prosthesis surgery. Patients have minimal increased radiation&#xD;
      dose compared to the usual control regime after hip replacement surgery. Written and informed&#xD;
      consent is required. The local research ethics committee must approve the study before&#xD;
      initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements were taken for the radiation dose, which shows that the stereo x-ray of the hip&#xD;
      provides a very low radiation dose of 0.15 mSv.. DXA measurements of the femur or spine&#xD;
      (osteoporosis control) produce an effective dose equivalent to 292 millisievert (milliSv) and&#xD;
      a scan around the hip implants produce an effective dose of 146 milliSv (info from General&#xD;
      Electric (GE) scanner manufacturer). A conventional radiograph of the hip provides a dose of&#xD;
      0.85 milliSv. Patients, who undergo hip prosthesis surgery outside the protocol in our&#xD;
      hospital unit, have one conventional radiograph after surgery and, as of recently, no&#xD;
      clinical or radiographic later follow-up due to necessary cuts on budget-costs. Patients in&#xD;
      this study have one conventional radiograph post-operatively and one conventional x-ray at 2&#xD;
      years and 5 years follow-up. In total the project patients are subjected to an additional&#xD;
      radiation dose of 2 conventional radiographs (1.7 mSv), 1 osteoporosis assessment (0.03 mSv),&#xD;
      seven times periprosthetic DXA scans including double measurements (0.1 mSv) and six times&#xD;
      the stereo radiography including double measurements (0.9 mSv). Patients included in this&#xD;
      study get exposed to an additional radiation dose of 2.73 mSv. This corresponds to&#xD;
      approximately 3 conventional radiographs of the hip, and it provides an additional risk of&#xD;
      fatal cancer of 0.01%. This places the subjects in group IIb., where the overall risk of the&#xD;
      irradiated individual is 1 to 10,000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No financial support/compensation will be offered to patients for study participation.&#xD;
      Regarding compensation and remuneration after death or injury of a project participant&#xD;
      reference is to the national patient insurance program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication of results The project is part of a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) project&#xD;
      concerning treatment of dislocated Garden I and II femoral neck fracture with a dual-mobility&#xD;
      arthroplasty concept. The Ph.D. protocol has been approved for enrollment at Aarhus&#xD;
      University Hospital during spring/summer 2014. All results, both positive and negative as&#xD;
      well as inconclusive, will be sought published in international scientific peer-reviewed&#xD;
      journals as well as presented on national and international scientific conferences. The&#xD;
      Vancouver rules for authorship will be followed. There is a mutual agreement that Steffan&#xD;
      Tábori Jensen will write the manuscript as the first author.&#xD;
