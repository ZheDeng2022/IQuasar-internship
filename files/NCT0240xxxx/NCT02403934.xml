  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maintaining a patent airway is a constant concern to any anesthesia provider performing deep&#xD;
      sedation cases. The doses of sedative medications often required for the desired level of&#xD;
      sedation in a patient often result in occlusion of the airway and the patient becoming&#xD;
      apneic. Opening the collapsed or occluded airway requires the use of an invasive airway&#xD;
      device, (e.g. laryngeal mask airway (LMA), oral airway or nasal airway) or the application of&#xD;
      a jaw thrust maneuver. When the provider provides jaw thrust while attending to the other&#xD;
      duties, the patient may not have adequate ventilation and the patient's oxygen saturation can&#xD;
      fall producing hypoxemia. Airway management devices currently available require deeper levels&#xD;
      of sedation to be tolerated by patients. In order to avoid the need for internal airway&#xD;
      devices, providers attempt to carefully adjust the level of sedation so that no airway&#xD;
      support is required. For safety, providers usually try to stay on the &quot;light&quot; side of the&#xD;
      sedation scale. Unfortunately, this often results in an uncomfortable patient or one who is&#xD;
      moving too much to successfully carry out the procedure. Until the availability of the Jaw&#xD;
      Elevation Device (JED) there was no external device providers could utilize to assist in&#xD;
      opening a patient's airway. By duplicating the jaw thrust maneuver, the JED maintains a&#xD;
      patent airway. Once applied, it frees the anesthesia provider to attend to other duties&#xD;
      associated with administration of anesthesia without requiring the provider to manually&#xD;
      maintain a jaw thrust maneuver. The advantages with such a device would allow a level of&#xD;
      sedation deep enough for the patient to tolerate the procedure as well as maintain a patent&#xD;
      airway. To date, there have not been any studies evaluating the JED in clinical practice. The&#xD;
      investigators wish to evaluate the JED in a standardized fashion during deep sedation or&#xD;
      monitored anesthesia care (MAC). Our study would involve 50 patients who became apneic during&#xD;
      deep sedation or MAC. A jaw thrust maneuver will be initially performed to demonstrate that&#xD;
      each patient's airway can be adequately supported by this maneuver. The JED will then be&#xD;
      placed in order to maintain a patent airway, while leaving the level of sedation unchanged.&#xD;
      Intraoperative monitoring, continuous ECG, pulse oximetry, blood pressure, capnography, will&#xD;
      be routine, and determined by the anesthesia team. The investigators will also track how&#xD;
      often the provider was required to adjust the JED to maintain a patent airway, and if the&#xD;
      need to convert to an alternate method of airway management was required. The investigators&#xD;
      will pursue publication of the results as the first study demonstrating the efficacy of the&#xD;
      JED.&#xD;

      1. General Approach: 50 Research subjects will be selected from patients scheduled to undergo&#xD;
      transvaginal oocyte (egg) retrieval under sedation or MAC. Sedation for these procedures&#xD;
      typically consists of intravenous administration of a combination of midazolam, fentanyl,&#xD;
      propofol, and/or ketamine titrated until the patient is calm, while supplemental oxygen is&#xD;
      provided by mask or nasal cannula. A continuous infusion of propofol is then begun to keep&#xD;
      the patient sedated enough that they will lie still and breathe regularly, but still respond&#xD;
      to commands or noxious stimuli (such as a sternal rub). As per standard anesthetic care, each&#xD;
      patient will have their oxygen saturation, end-tidal carbon dioxide waveform and heart&#xD;
      rate/rhythm measured continuously while the anesthesia care provider monitors the patient for&#xD;
      signs of inadequate respiration and airway obstruction. These signs include a loss of the&#xD;
      end-tidal carbon dioxide waveform, snoring, paradoxical ventilation, cessation of ventilatory&#xD;
      efforts, or a reduction in the oxygen saturation. Typically, whenever these signs are&#xD;
      present, the anesthesia provider provides a jaw thrust to open the patient's airway and&#xD;
      restore adequate ventilation. Once accomplished, the anesthesia care provider typically&#xD;
      lowers the dose of anesthetic and releases jaw thrust. If signs of airway obstruction recur,&#xD;
      jaw thrust is applied again until the level of sedation has reached a level low enough that&#xD;
      the patient can breathe without airway support. However, this may lead to inadequate&#xD;
      sedation, patient movement and difficulty for the surgeon to perform the procedure. The depth&#xD;
      of sedation required for the egg retrieval procedure frequently results in needing to perform&#xD;
      a jaw thrust or placing an airway device to maintain airway patency. Applying the JED after a&#xD;
      jaw thrust may alleviate the airway obstruction while allowing adequate sedation to be&#xD;
      maintained without a compromise in the anesthetic depth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Description: Prior to anesthesia, all subjects will be given supplemental oxygen and&#xD;
      monitored with pulse oximetry, end tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) capnography, noninvasive&#xD;
      blood pressure, heart rate and rhythm measurement. In this study, once the patient is sedated&#xD;
      and inadequate ventilation is identified as stated above, a jaw thrust maneuver will be&#xD;
      applied. If this maintains adequate ventilation the JED will then be placed on the patient&#xD;
      and adjusted to produce a simulated jaw thrust in an effort to open the obstructive airway.&#xD;
      Once the JED is appropriately placed and clinical signs of ventilation achieved, the&#xD;
      investigator will document the number of times that the anesthesia provider must manipulate&#xD;
      the JED device to achieve an adequate airway. If at any time the anesthesia care provider&#xD;
      feels that the JED cannot be adjusted to successfully maintain the airway, the use of the JED&#xD;
      will be discontinued and the anesthesia provider will employ an airway management technique&#xD;
      of their choice. In addition, the time of initial placement of the JED until end of JED use&#xD;
      will be recorded to obtain total time of JED use during the anesthetic. The number of&#xD;
      adjustments per unit time of JED use will then be calculated to compare to a constant jaw&#xD;
      thrust that would otherwise be required. The duration of anesthesia administration with also&#xD;
      be collected beginning with induction of anesthesia/sedation until cessation of infusion. The&#xD;
      study will be continued until 50 patients have been entered into the study. Information will&#xD;
      be collected even if the patient does not require a jaw thrust and the JED is not placed. Due&#xD;
      to the high frequency of requiring airway assistance with egg retrieval procedures performed&#xD;
      under deep sedation, the incidence of patients not requiring assistance is likely to be low&#xD;
      and 50 patients was felt to be an adequate study size to describe the utility and efficacy of&#xD;
      the JED in this setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 Methods: One of the above listed investigators will observe the anesthetic and collect&#xD;
      observed data listed on the attached data collection sheet. Data to be collected will include&#xD;
      the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data point Method of measurement Date of procedure day/month/year (DD/MM/YYYY) Patient gender&#xD;
      Population is all female ASA class 1-6 Age In years Height inches Weight kilograms BMI Kg/m2&#xD;

      hypoxemia Minutes:seconds Complications List complications Conversion to GA Yes/No Method of&#xD;
      GA List method Other airway devices used List device&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Investigational Drugs/Devices/Biologics Research: Jaw Elevation Device (JED). The FDA has&#xD;
      determined the JED is a Class 1 device and thus exempt from 510 K.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Research Material Collected: A data collection form will be filled out by the anesthesia&#xD;
      provider and returned to an investigator. Information will include details about the&#xD;
      anesthetic technique used, and the performance of the JED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Protection of Patient Privacy: All documents relating to an individual's participation in&#xD;
      this study will be kept in a locked storage. Access to records will be limited to the PI and&#xD;
      AI's. Computer files containing collected study data will be stored in a password protected&#xD;
      file system. Identifying information will be recorded on separate form and linked to data&#xD;
      collection forms with a numbering system, deidentifying the data. Data will be transcribed&#xD;
      into secured electronic files which will be used for data analysis. Once data analysis is&#xD;
      complete the data collection sheets will be destroyed or shredded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Risks: This study confers no additional risk to patients as this in an observational study&#xD;
      using the JED in a marketed application. All patients in the study will receive the same&#xD;
      treatment. There are associated risks with receiving deep sedation. These include but are not&#xD;
      limited to: airway obstruction, need to use other types of airway devices including an&#xD;
      endotracheal tube, sore throat, nausea and vomiting, aspiration, and other serious, but rare,&#xD;
      complications (cardiovascular or pulmonary complications). However, these are risks inherent&#xD;
      to the administration of sedation for your procedure. You would be at risk for these whether&#xD;
      or not you participated in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Radiation or Laser Exposure: None&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. Justification of Risks: The JED offers the potential advantage of increasing the range of&#xD;
      patients who could safely tolerate deep sedation or MAC. By completing this study we hope to&#xD;
      begin the characterization of populations who can benefit from the use of JED in deep&#xD;
      sedation or MAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10. Minimization of Risks: By providing a systematic approach to patient selection and data&#xD;
      collection we hope to gain maximum utility from our study. By performing this study in an&#xD;
      observational fashion we will allow anesthesia providers to retain full control of anesthetic&#xD;
      management, for essentially no alteration in the standard of care, and virtually no&#xD;
      additional clinical risk. Risk of the exposure of PHI will minimized through the methods&#xD;
      discussed above.&#xD;
