  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of perineal pain control via&#xD;
      injection of a local anesthetic to numb the pudendal nerve. The medication which is commonly&#xD;
      used for this block is called marcaine. This is called a pudendal block it has been used in&#xD;
      obstetrical and gynecologic surgeries for several decades. The goal of this study is to&#xD;
      reduce the amount of pain medications taken post operatively after pelvic reconstructive&#xD;
      surgery. Subjects undergoing pelvic reconstructive surgery will be recruited during the&#xD;
      pre-op visit. Subjects will be asked about their pain level in the PACU and also asked to&#xD;
      document their pain score days 1 and 2 post op. They will also be asked to keep a medication&#xD;
      log for 14 days post op.&#xD;

      Subjects will have a through physical exam with evolution of the pelvis support using the&#xD;
      POP-Q (pelvic organ prolapse quantification) system. All subjects will need to sign informed&#xD;
      consent pre-approved by the IRB. The subjects, surgeons, and anesthesiologist will all be&#xD;
      blinded to the injected material. The OR Scrub nurse will given the envelope at the start of&#xD;
      each case and asked to draw the material into a syringe. All subjects will receive general&#xD;
      anesthesia. Subjects will be randomized to receive preemptive pudendal nerve blockade with 10&#xD;
      ml of 0 .5 % Bupivacaine with epinephrine or normal saline to each side. The allocation&#xD;
      schedule is computer generated using random-numbers table concealed in opaque envelops. Once&#xD;
      the patient receives general anesthesia she will be positioned appropriately in dorsal&#xD;
      lithotomy with padded Allan stir ups. 10 ml of Bupivacaine will be injected on either side&#xD;
      using the Iowa trumpet pudendal needle drive to direct and guide appropriate position.&#xD;
      Aspiration was attempted for every injection to decrease the chance of intravascular&#xD;
      infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the completion of the surgery the subjects will be brought to the PACU for care. Patients&#xD;
      are assessed immediately upon arrival to the PACU. The patients are asked their pain level&#xD;
      using the VAS pain scale/ modified surgical pain scale at hours 1 and 2 post op. All patients&#xD;
      are given a prescription for Vicoprofen 7.5/200mg at their pre-op visit and asked to have it&#xD;
      filled prior to their surgery. Patients have the option to go home the same day of surgery as&#xD;
      long as their pain is well controlled and they are clinically stable for discharge. Continued&#xD;
      pain management and pain scale assessment will be done at 4 hours, and post op day 1 and 2. A&#xD;
      medication log will be kept for 2 weeks post op, detailing the number of pain medications&#xD;
      taken during that period.&#xD;
