  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this single-arm phase 2 clinical trial is to evaluate the anti-cancer activity of&#xD;
      Talazoparib (also known as BMN 673) in patients with advanced breast cancer with specific&#xD;
      genetic or tumor genomic alterations. Patients with either triple-negative or HER2-negative&#xD;
      breast cancer are eligible.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Talazoparib (BMN 673) is a novel, dual-mechanism PARP inhibitor that potently inhibits the&#xD;
      PARP enzyme and effectively traps PARP on DNA. Talazoparib has shown promising single-agent&#xD;
      anti-tumor efficacy in several BRCA1/2 mutation-associated advanced cancers. The efficacy of&#xD;
      PARP inhibition in BRCA1/2 wild-type TNBC with homologous recombination (HR) defects and in&#xD;
      breast tumors with mutations in other non-BRCA1/2 HR pathway genes is currently unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase 2 trial explores the activity of single agent talazoparib in BRCA1/2 wild-type BC&#xD;
      patients using an optimal Simon two-stage design. Eligible subjects will be assigned to one&#xD;
      of two parallel cohorts: 1) Cohort A: Subjects (n=29) with advanced TNBC with underlying HR&#xD;
      defects as assessed by the HRD assay and, 2) Cohort B: Subjects (n=29) with advanced&#xD;
      HER2-negative BC with a somatic or germline mutation in a non-BRCA1/2 HR pathway gene. Gene&#xD;
      mutations of interest are: PTEN, PALB2, CHEK2, ATM, NBN, BARD1, BRIP1, RAD50, RAD51C, RAD51D,&#xD;
      MRE11, ATR, Fanconi anemia complementation group of genes (FANCA, FANCC, FANCD2, FANCE,&#xD;
      FANCF, FANCG, FANCL).&#xD;
