      Metreleptin was approved in the United States as adjunct to diet as replacement therapy to&#xD;
      treat the complications of leptin deficiency in patients with congenital or acquired&#xD;
      generalized lipodystrophy in February 2014. The approval was based on results obtained in 2&#xD;
      open-label, investigator-sponsored studies (Studies 991265 and 20010769) conducted at the&#xD;
      National Institutes of Health (NIH) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of metreleptin&#xD;
      treatment in patients with lipodystrophy and 1 treatment IND (FHA101/MB002-002/MB002-002)&#xD;
      conducted by Bristol-Myers Squibb on behalf of AstraZeneca (BMS/AZ) in patients with diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus and/or hypertriglyceridemia related to lipodystrophy. These studies enrolled&#xD;
      patients with lipodsytrophy including both generalized and partial lipodystrophy. Although&#xD;
      the marketing authorization restricted the indication to patients with generalized&#xD;
      lipodystrophy, meaningful clinical benefit was achieved in a subset of patients with partial&#xD;
      lipodystrophy, and these patients from FHA101/MB002-002 form the basis of the request for&#xD;
      ongoing treatment under expanded access.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Leptin is a naturally occurring hormone and an important regulator of energy homeostasis and&#xD;
      other diverse physiological functions. Circulating levels of leptin closely correlate with&#xD;
      the amount of adipose tissue present. Metreleptin, a recombinant analogue of human leptin, is&#xD;
      a 147-amino acid polypeptide that differs from the human leptin sequence by 1 additional&#xD;
      amino acid, methionine, located at the amino-terminal end. Metreleptin has the same&#xD;
      physiological effects as leptin, including regulation of energy homeostasis and metabolic&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient group covered under this expanded access submission has demonstrated evidence of&#xD;
      clinical benefit from treatment with metreleptin in clinical study FHA101/MB002-002, and&#xD;
      needs expanded access to continue treatment without interruption.&#xD;

&#xD;
             a) Before any program procedures are performed, the details of the program will be&#xD;
             described to the patient and the patient will be given a written informed consent&#xD;
             document to read. If the patient agrees to participate in the program, consent will be&#xD;
             indicated by signing and dating of the informed consent document in the presence of&#xD;
             program personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Target Population&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Ability to comply with visits and procedures required by program&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Previously enrolled in study FHA101/MB002-002&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Has physician-confirmed partial lipodystrophy and had evidence of benefit with&#xD;
                  metreleptin treatment based on the following metabolic criteria demonstrated&#xD;
                  within the last year of metreleptin treatment (if on treatment over 1 year) from&#xD;
                  baseline values:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  TG reduction ≥ 30% OR&#xD;

                    -  HbA1c reduction ≥ 1% OR&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Decrease in insulin requirements ≥ 40% OR&#xD;
