      This is a single arm, open label, multi-center, phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of sequential treatment with Melphalan/HDS followed by sorafenib in patients with&#xD;
      unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) confined to the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will receive up to 3 Melphalan/HDS treatments. Each treatment cycle&#xD;
      consists of 6 weeks with an acceptable delay for another 2 weeks before next planned&#xD;
      treatment. The Melphalan/HDS treatment will be terminated in patients with progressive&#xD;
      disease (PD), complete response (CR), and &gt; 8 weeks delay of recovery from toxicity after&#xD;
      last PHP treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the exception of patients with PD, all patients will be treated with sorafenib after&#xD;
      completing the Melphalan/HDS treatment. Patients with PD will be managed with standard of&#xD;
      care off-study by their treating physician.&#xD;
