  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For prepubertal patients, cryopreservation of testicular tissue is the only option available&#xD;
      to preserve their fertility before cancer treatment. But testicular autograft raises the&#xD;
      issue of the risk of reintroduction of potentially malignant cells. The aim of our study is&#xD;
      to develop a specific and sensitive method for residual disease detection in the testicular&#xD;
      tissue from patients treated for a solid tumor during infancy, whose fertility may have been&#xD;
      compromised by treatments and who benefited of testicular tissue cryopreservation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some solid tumors have high risk of metastatic localization including in testis. There is&#xD;
      concern over the possible presence of malignant cells in testicular tissue that could cause a&#xD;
      recurrence of the primary disease after reimplantation. Thus, the possibility of testicular&#xD;
      tissue involvement needs to be evaluated with sensitive molecular methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on our experience in detection by RT-PCR of minimal residual disease (MRD) in&#xD;
      neuroblastoma since 1994 [Tchirkov et al. 2003] and in testicular tissue cryopreservation&#xD;
      since 2012, we want to develop a specific and sensitive method for residual disease detection&#xD;
      by RT-PCR in order to evaluate the tumor contamination of testicular harvested tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: We chose 3 models of pediatric solid tumors with high risk of metastases&#xD;
      and which often require sterilizing treatments (chemo and/or radiotherapy): neuroblastoma,&#xD;
      Ewing tumor and alveolar rhabdosarcoma. We will use four tumor cells lines: IMR32 and SK-NSH&#xD;
      for neuroblastoma; RD-ES for Ewing tumor; RH-30 for rhabdosarcoma. We plan to use 20&#xD;
      fragments per line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration: 12 months Study design: Testicular tissue without known malignancy but with a&#xD;
      condition warranting a biopsy (fertility assessment) will be harvested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The harvested testicular cortex will be treated to recover all viable sperm and then, we use&#xD;
      remaining tissue to be contaminated with tumor cells lines. Then, detection of the specific&#xD;
      transcript will be done by RT-PCR in fresh tissue and after freeze/thaw. Total RNA will be&#xD;
      extracted with the TRI-reagent and qRT-PCR will be performed using the &quot;TaqMan&quot; technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: to reach a sensitivity about 1/106 cells.&#xD;
