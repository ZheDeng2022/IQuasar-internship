      The aim of research proposal is to assess and compare the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      radiofrequency denervation of pulmonary arteries on decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance&#xD;
      and mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) in 20 patients with IPAH (mean pulmonary artery&#xD;
      pressure &gt;25 mmHg) and in 20 patients with secondary pulmonary hypertension due to pulmonary&#xD;
      disease or due to left heart disease not responding optimally to medical therapy.&#xD;

      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient population. Patients with IPAH and SPAH (defined as a mean PAP &gt;25 mm Hg at rest) not&#xD;
      responding optimally to current medical therapy (defined as a reduction of &lt;5mmHg in the&#xD;
      resting mean PAP during medication, or unchanged 6-min walk test (6MWT) defined as increment&#xD;
      of 6MW distance &lt;50 m) will be eligible for the study. The patients will be informed that&#xD;
      they have the right to withdraw their informed consent at any time. After signing a&#xD;
      previously approved institutional written informed consent 20 patients with proven IPAH and&#xD;
      20 patients with proven SPAH and 20 control patients (10 with IPAH and 10 with SPAH) will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to radiofrequency denervation of pulmonary arteries or to sham group.&#xD;
      Patients of age &lt;18 years, patients with structural heart diseases with left-to right&#xD;
      shunting and/or with Eisenmenger syndrome will be excluded from the trial. Medical treatment&#xD;
      before enrollment including a diuretics sildenafil or bosentan or digoxin or any other&#xD;
      necessary medication will not be discontinued. Blood samples will be obtained for N-terminal&#xD;
      brain natriuretic peptide (NT-BNP), troponin T, mbCK, CK and other usually accepted&#xD;
      biological markers of pulmonary hypertension levels before, immediately after the pulmonary&#xD;
      artery denervation (PADN) procedure, and at 3 and 6 months following the PADN procedure. For&#xD;
      the assessment of potential anatomical complications at the sight of PADN a multisliced&#xD;
      computed tomography angiography of pulmonary trunk and pulmonary arteries will be obtained&#xD;
      before and 6 months after PADN procedure. Assessment of functional capacity (9) will be&#xD;
      determined by the six-minutes walk test (6MWT), followed by an assessment of dyspnea using&#xD;
      the Borg scale (10). The 6MWT will be performed at 3 month and 6 months following the PADN&#xD;
      procedure. The World Health Organization classification (11) at rest and during exercise will&#xD;
      be recorded by a physician blinded to the study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiography will be performed at 3 month and 6 months following the procedure.&#xD;
      Echocardiographic studies will be done using a Vivid 7 ultrasound system with a standard&#xD;
      imaging transducer (General Electric Co., Easton Turnpike, Connecticut). All of the&#xD;
      measurements will be performed according the recommendations of the American Society of&#xD;
      Echocardiography (12). Digital echocardiographic data that contained a minimum of 3&#xD;
      consecutive beats (or 5 beats in cases of atrial fibrillation) will be acquired and analyzed.&#xD;
      Right ventricular (RV) systolic pressure is equal to systolic PAP in the absence of pulmonary&#xD;
      stenosis. Systolic PAP is equal to the sum of the right atrial (RA) pressure and the RV-to-RA&#xD;
      pressure gradient during systole. RA pressure will be estimated based on the&#xD;
      echocardiographic features of the inferior vena cava and assigned a standard value (13). The&#xD;
      RV-to-RA pressure gradient will be calculated as 4vt2 using the modified Bernoulli equation,&#xD;
      where vt is the velocity of the tricuspid regurgitation jet in m/s. The mean PAP will be&#xD;
      estimated according to the velocity of the pulmonary regurgitation jet in m/s. The tricuspid&#xD;
      excursion index (Tei) (14) is defined as (A-B)/B, where A is the time interval between the&#xD;
      end and the onset of tricuspid annular diastolic velocity, and B is the duration of tricuspid&#xD;
      annular systolic velocity (or the RV ejection time). PA compliance for patients will be&#xD;
      calculated as the stroke volume divided by pulse pressure (systolic PAP minus diastolic PAP).&#xD;
      Hemodynamic measurements and blood oxygen pressure/saturation determinations from the RA, RV,&#xD;
      and PA will be performed as previously described using right heart catheterization before and&#xD;
      immediately after the PADN procedure. These measurements will be repeated at 24 h, 3 months&#xD;
      and 12 months. Measurements of resting RA pressure, RV pressure, systolic/diastolic/mean PAP,&#xD;
      PA occlusive pressure (PAOP), cardiac output (CO) and mixed venous oxygen saturation will be&#xD;
      recorded. The pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) [PVR ¼(mean PAP- PAOP)/CO] and&#xD;
      transpulmonary pressure gradient (TPG ¼ mean PAP- PAOP) will then be calculated. All of the&#xD;
      measurements will be recorded at the end of expiration. Five criteria (15-17) will be used to&#xD;
      evaluate whether a PAOP measurement was valid: 1) the PAOP was less than the diastolic PAP;&#xD;
      2) the tracing was comparable to the atrial pressure waveform; 3) the fluoroscopic image&#xD;
      exhibited a stationary catheter following inflation; 4) free flow was present within the&#xD;
      catheter (flush test); and 5) highly oxygenated blood (capillary) was obtained from the&#xD;
      distal portion in the occlusion position. If the PAOP measurement was unreliable, the left&#xD;
      ventricular end-diastolic pressure will then be measured and used rather than the PAOP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood samples from the superior vena cava and PA will be obtained for the measurements of&#xD;
      oxygen pressure and saturation. PADN procedure. A baseline PA angiography will be performed&#xD;
      to identify the PA bifurcation level and calculate the PA diameter. An 8-F long sheath will&#xD;
      be inserted through the femoral vein and advanced to the main PA (MPA). The PADN catheter&#xD;
      will be advanced along this long sheath. After gently withdrawing the sheath and pushing the&#xD;
      PADN catheter, the tip will be released from the sheath. Then, by slightly rotating and&#xD;
      pushing the handle the tip will be positioned first at the ostium of the left PA (Level 1 of&#xD;
      ablation, &lt;2 mm distal to orifice. After ablation at this level, the catheter tip will be&#xD;
      positioned at the ostium of right PA (Level 2 of ablation, &lt;2mm proximal to the bifurcation&#xD;
      level). Finally, denervation of main pulmonary artery will be done by pulling the denervation&#xD;
      catheter back into Level 3 of ablation (&lt;2 mm proximal to both ostia of right and left PA-s)&#xD;
      into main pulmonary artery.Three criteria will be used to ensure that the electrodes were&#xD;
      tightly in contact with the endovascular surface: 1) strong manual resistance when rotating&#xD;
      the handle; 2) inability to advance distally or ease in, withdrawing proximally 3)&#xD;
      angiographic confirmation and 4) actual electrode contact pressure (gm) readings provided by&#xD;
      RF denervation system used. The procedure will be stopped if the patient complained of&#xD;
      intolerable chest pain. The electrocardiogram and hemodynamic pressure will be monitored and&#xD;
      continuously recorded throughout the procedure. Procedural success will be defined as a&#xD;
      reduction in the mean PAP &gt;10 mm Hg (as measured by the Swan-Ganz catheter), and there were&#xD;
      no complications. The patients will be monitored in the intensive cardiac care unit for at&#xD;
      least 24 h after the PADN procedure. Commercially available and approved radiofrequency&#xD;
      technology for pulmonary vein isolation will be utilized for new clinical indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peri-procedural medications. An intravenous bolus of 5,000 U of unfractionated heparin will&#xD;
      be given immediately following the insertion of the venous sheath. An additional&#xD;
      approximately 2,000 to 3,000 U of heparin will be added if the procedural time exceeds 1 h.&#xD;
      Following the procedure, oral warfarin will be prescribed and adjusted according to the&#xD;
      international normalized ratio to be between 2 and 2.5 for all patients. If there would be&#xD;
      contraindications for warfarin, aspirin (100 mg/day) and clopidogrel (75 mg/day) will be&#xD;
      prescribed indefinitely. Immediately after the PADN procedure, all medications (diuretics,&#xD;
      sildenafil, bosentan, beraprost, digoxin etc.) will be discontinued for 24h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints. The primary endpoints will be decrease in mean PAP and pulmonary vascular&#xD;
      resistance at 3 and 6 months and improvement of functional capacity by the 6MWT. Clinical&#xD;
      adverse events (including PA perforation/dissection, acute thrombus formation in the PA,&#xD;
      all-cause death, rehospitalization due to PAH, and lung transplantation) will be secondary&#xD;
      endpoints and will be assessed by an independent event committee. Statistical analysis.&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be expressed as mean + SD. Differences in continuous variables&#xD;
      between different time points in the PADN group will be analyzed using paired-sample Student&#xD;
      t tests or Wilcoxon signed- rank sum tests, as appropriate nonparametric statistical methods.&#xD;
      Each patient in the trial will serve as his/her own control before and after PADN and sham&#xD;
      group patients as a control group of overall efficacy of the procedure. The categorical&#xD;
      variables will be compared using the Fisher exact test. Statistical significance will be&#xD;
      defined as a 2-sided p value &lt; 0.05. All of the analyses will be performed using WinStat&#xD;
      statistical software package for Microsoft Excel, version 2009.&#xD;
