      Understanding risk factors and determinants for neuropathic pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuropathic pain (NP) is common (population prevalence of 7-8%) and will present a rising&#xD;
      health burden in the future. NP arises as a consequence of a disease or lesion in the&#xD;
      somatosensory nervous system. NP results in significant morbidity, reduces quality of life&#xD;
      and has a major deleterious impact on health in aging. However, not everyone with such a&#xD;
      lesion develops significant neuropathic pain, and those who do develop it include a wide&#xD;
      range of severity, impact and outcomes, and an unpredictable response to evidence-based&#xD;
      treatment. The reason why some subjects develop neuropathic pain and others do not following&#xD;
      the same injury is not known. Genetic variants are increasingly recognized as being important&#xD;
      in the development of neuropathic pain. There are a number of Mendelian primary neuropathic&#xD;
      pain disorders which act as exemplars of high impact gene variants which have in a number of&#xD;
      cases been shown to alter primary afferent excitability. In addition genetic factors are also&#xD;
      likely to be important as risk factors in more common acquired (or secondary) neuropathic&#xD;
      pain disorders. So, identifying these risk factors will have a significant impact on health&#xD;
      both in identifying vulnerable patients and potential for developing new treatment&#xD;
      modalities. The proposed study is a part of multicenter international project under Horizons&#xD;
      2020 program of the European Union. Our aim is to understand pain pathophysiology in terms of&#xD;
      risk factors and protective mechanisms ranging from molecular pathways to societal impacts.&#xD;
      The desired impact is to provide a firm platform to improve diagnosis and stratify patients&#xD;
      according to risk profile, employ preventive strategies and ultimately develop novel&#xD;
      therapeutics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives for the study at large will be to: 1) Identify the influence of&#xD;
      demographic, environmental/societal and clinical factors on the risk of developing and&#xD;
      maintenance of NP. 2) To apply modern genomics to validate (using a targeted approach) and&#xD;
      find novel (using genome wide association) genetic risk factors for NP. 3) To determine if&#xD;
      patient stratification using physiological (sensory profile, endogenous analgesic mechanisms&#xD;
      and nerve excitability) and psychological factors can predict NP risk and progression. 4)&#xD;
      Development of a risk model/algorithm for (severe) NP, combining measurable genetic and&#xD;
      environmental factors. The desired impact is to provide a firm platform to improve diagnosis&#xD;
      and stratify patients according to risk profile, employ preventive strategies and ultimately&#xD;
      develop novel therapeutics.&#xD;

        200 patients with painful and non-painful diabetic neuropathy (males and females, ages ≥18)&#xD;
        will be tested in the study performed in the Rambam Medical Center. The patients will be&#xD;
        recruited from the neurology/diabetes clinics and by advertisement in local newspapers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No patients will be requested to withdraw from any of their medication, or to change the&#xD;
        treatment regimen due to participation in the study.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with diabetes who are ≥18 years of age who have a diagnosis of peripheral&#xD;
             neuropathy based on a prior clinical assessment combined with supportive clinical&#xD;
             investigations such as abnormal nerve conduction studies, reduced intraepidermal nerve&#xD;
             or abnormal findings on quantitative sensory testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If supportive clinical investigations (as described above) are not available at entry&#xD;
             into the study, a neuropathy disability scale ≥3 will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with symptoms highly suggestive of neuropathy that in the judgment of the&#xD;
             clinical researcher are suitable for the study even if they do not fulfill other&#xD;
             inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with insufficient command of Hebrew to obtain consent from or to complete the&#xD;
             study questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with insufficient mental capacity to obtain consent from or complete study&#xD;
             questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with concurrent severe psychological or psychiatric disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with moderate to severe pain form other causes that may confound assessment&#xD;
             or reporting of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with central nervous lesions, which may complicate somatosensory testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Who is in the opinion of the investigator unsuitable for participation in the study.&#xD;
