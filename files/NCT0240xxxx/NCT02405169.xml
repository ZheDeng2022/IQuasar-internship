      The primary objective of the present study is to evaluate the marginal bone level changes&#xD;
      occurring in total edentulous patients treated with six or four implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  overall survival rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  soft tissue status by assessment of bleeding on probing (BoP) and probing pocket depth&#xD;
           (PPD) at baseline and after 1,3,5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  prosthetic survival rates including screw or abutment loosening, framework or veneer&#xD;

      METHODS/PROCEDURES A randomized controlled multi-center clinical study is designed to&#xD;
      determine whether a difference exists between the outcome of treatment when Astra tech&#xD;
      implants are placed according to a six or a four implants protocol. The investigation will be&#xD;
      performed in four centers: three in Italy affiliated to Institute Franci and one affiliated&#xD;
      to the Department of Prosthodontics, Faculty of Odontology, Malmö University. In each center&#xD;
      the clinician and the examiner will be the same person. The study protocol will be approved&#xD;
      by the Regional Human Review Board of Padova General Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An investigators' meeting will be arranged prior to the starting with the patients'&#xD;
      recruitment. Following a screening examination, subjects who will meet the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria, will sign the Informed Consent and will be enrolled in the study. The period of&#xD;
      patient enrollment will begin on January 1 2013 and ends December 31 2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be randomized with a method based on the use of sealed opaque envelopes.&#xD;
      The cases will be assigned to two different treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A- four implants (Test) Group B- six implants (Control)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-treatment Patient data, medical history, clinical and radiographic examination will be&#xD;
      recorded for each patient. Clinical photographs will be taken in frontal, occlusal and&#xD;
      lateral projections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal, endodontic and open caries lesions will be treated prior to implant&#xD;
      installation. All patients will receive careful oral hygiene instructions and training in&#xD;
      self-performed&#xD;
&#xD;
      plaque control measure. CT scan computed exams will be carried out. Plaster models and&#xD;
      diagnostic wax-up will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First Surgical Phase (Implant Installation) The patient will receive antibiotic prophylaxis&#xD;
      (Amoxicillin 1gr) one hour prior to surgery and after the completion of implant installation&#xD;
      until suture removal with 1gr three times a day. (If the patient is allergic to amoxicillin&#xD;
      the examiner prescribes antibiotics at his own discretion at the same posology).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical treatment will be performed under local anesthesia. In case of remaining teeth,&#xD;
      they will be extracted with conventional technique before implants' placement. (13-14)&#xD;
      Implants will be placed according to the guidelines described in the Astra Tech® manual&#xD;
      &quot;Surgical procedures&quot;, using a two-stage protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implant spinning during the positioning of the cover screw will be registered as positive, if&#xD;
      present, or negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operation will be finalized by a careful adaption of the flaps by means of an accurate&#xD;
      suture in order to obtain a full periosteal coverage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoral clinical photographs before, during and after surgery will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative care The patients will be instructed to rinse with chlorhexidine 0.12%&#xD;
      mouthrinse and will be told to rinse with the antiseptic solution three times a day for 2&#xD;
      weeks. The patients will be advised to take NSAIDs for pain relief at their own discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liquid and semisolid food will be prescribed for the first post-operative week, after which&#xD;
      the sutures will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two weeks after the operation the denture will be properly relined until the second stage&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be controlled at third and sixth weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second surgical phase and Prosthetic procedures After eight weeks (+ 2) of healing in both&#xD;
      groups (A and B) Uni Abutment 45° connection procedure will be performed. Impression with a&#xD;
      customized spoon and Impregum material will be taken and the prosthetic procedure will be&#xD;
      performed according to the Atlantis-Isus recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 6 weeks (+ 2) from Uni Abutment connection the definitive full-arch fixed dental&#xD;
      prostheses screw retained will be applied. The prosthesis will be made to accomplish the&#xD;
      normal hygienic procedures. All prosthetic procedures will be made in accordance to the Astra&#xD;
      Tech procedures &amp; products manuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The length of bridge cantilevers will be duly calculated to minimize implant overloading&#xD;
      according to the Atlantis-Isus recommendations (15)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-prosthetic measurements Clinical measurements Clinical examinations will be performed&#xD;
      immediately following the installation of the definitive prosthesis (Baseline-Loading) and&#xD;
      after 1, 3, and 5 years. In particular, plaque and soft-tissue inflammation will be&#xD;
      registered. Clinical photographs will be taken at each interval point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plaque: the presence of plaque will be scored at each implant site as well as at level of the&#xD;
      remaining teeth on four surfaces (buccal, lingual/palatal, mesial, distal). The mean&#xD;
      percentage of plaque harboring surfaces will be calculated using the case as the unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Soft-tissue inflammation: the presence of soft-tissue inflammation (bleeding on probing) will&#xD;
      be assessed on buccal, lingual/palatal, mesial, distal aspects of each implant. The mean&#xD;
      percentage of inflamed sites will be calculated using the case as the unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic measurements Peri-apical radiographs will be taken at prosthesis insertion&#xD;
      (Baseline) and after 1, 3, and 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radiographs will be taken with an X-ray apparatus supplied with a long cone by the&#xD;
      examiner each visiting time. Rinn centrators will be used to ensure reproducibility in the&#xD;
      measurement of marginal bone level change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radiographic images will be analysed at the Department of Radiology of Sahlgrenska&#xD;
      Academy, Gothenburg University by experienced radiologists who will be otherwise not involved&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
