    <textblock>
      This is a single-site, double-blinded, randomized, controlled, 2X2 cross-over study aiming to&#xD;
      compare effects of milk containing only A2 type beta casein versus milk containing both A1&#xD;
      and A2 beta casein proteins on the gastrointestinal physiology, symptoms and cognitive&#xD;
      behaviour for the health people who are intolerant to traditional cow's milk.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-site, double-blinded, randomized, controlled, cross-over study in healthy&#xD;
      milk drinkers of 4 weeks' consumption with milk containing only A2 type beta casein (called&#xD;
      A2 milk) versus milk containing both A1 and A2 beta casein proteins (called A1 milk) to&#xD;
      compare the effects on gut inflammation (CRP, HB, IL-4, IgG, IgE, IgG1, IgG2a),&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms (via VAS score including Bloating, Abdominal pain, Flatulence,&#xD;
      Break wind, Borborygmi), regional gut transit times (via 'Smart Pill') and behavioral&#xD;
      well-being (CNAQ), and stool habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cross-over study will take 2 phases (2 weeks in each phase) of product intervention, 2&#xD;
      weeks of wash-out before each intervention phase and then followed by 5 wks of statistical&#xD;
      analysis and clinical report completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to ICH-GCP Guidelines and Chinese regulations issued by SFDA, all subjects will be&#xD;
      informed of study procedures and sign the informed consent before enrollment. At screening&#xD;
      phase, subjects will be informed about study requirements, procedures, potential risks and&#xD;
      benefits of participation. Subjects will not be enrolled into the study until ICF is well&#xD;
      informed and accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Screening phase, 100 subjects had the Urine galactose (U-gal) test to screen 45&#xD;
      subjects eligible for the study and they should simultaneously meet the Inclusion and&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria. Subjects should be fasting on the morning of testing, and then drink 300&#xD;
      ml full-fat milk within 3-5 minutes. Empty the urine 1 hour after drinking, and collect&#xD;
      midstream urine 2 hours after milk-consumption for urinary galactose test with symptom scores&#xD;
      recorded accordingly. Urine galactose (U-gal) tests positive indicating the lactase&#xD;
      deficiency, if it is accompanied by abdominal distension, abdominal pain and other symptoms&#xD;
      of more than 1 item; it is identified as lactose intolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 subjects took part in the screening by U-gal test and forty-five (45) qualified subjects&#xD;
      (stratified by male to female approximate ratio 1:1) will be enrolled into the study with&#xD;
      assumed 11.1% attrition rate to keep 20 subjects per group to complete the cross-over study.&#xD;
      Subjects will be enrolled in the study site authorized by Xin Hua Hospital during the&#xD;
      screening phase. Sun Jianqin, Professor, leading PI, is responsible for the academic guidance&#xD;
      to define all qualified subjects. The study will be conducted by the team of PIs and&#xD;
      monitored by SPRIM CHINA in accordance with Chinese Good Clinical Practices (CGCP's).&#xD;
      Subjects will sign the informed consent form before study intervention. Eligible subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized into 2 groups, and one of two possible products sequences will be&#xD;
      assigned, A1 milk or A2 milk. Subjects completed 2 weeks A1 or A2 intervention after initial&#xD;
      2 weeks of washout, and then cross over to the opposite intervention for 2 weeks after second&#xD;
      2 weeks of washout. The efficacy of the study products was evaluated by biomarkers in the&#xD;
      blood or feces and linked questionnaires at the duration of the cross-over study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study intervention, subjects need to visit the site every week; follow-up&#xD;
      telephone will be made at the duration of wash-out phase and the related information will be&#xD;
      collected by CRAs accordingly.&#xD;
