  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dymista, a combined product containing the antihistamine azelastine and the intranasal&#xD;
      steroid fluticasone, provides superior clinical efficacy to both fluticasone propionate and&#xD;
      azelastine hydrochloride in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis. The superiority of&#xD;
      efficacy not only occurs at the initiation of treatment, but persists for its duration. The&#xD;
      mechanism underlying the superior efficacy of Dymista is not known. This trial focuses on&#xD;
      examining the effects of Dymista on the dynamics of the allergic response in man using nasal&#xD;
      provocation with antigen. The investigators will study the relationship between symptoms,&#xD;
      physiology, cells and mediators.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main hypothesis for the trial is that Dymista affects multiple phases of the allergic&#xD;
      response, which in sum are greater than the effects of fluticasone propionate or azelastine&#xD;
      hydrochloride alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our objectives for this study are to demonstrate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. that the induction of allergic inflammation by nasal provocation with antigen causes a&#xD;
           cellular infiltration, with subsequent release of inflammatory biomarkers that cause&#xD;
           augmented responses to subsequent exposure to antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. that fluticasone prevents allergic inflammation from developing after antigen challenge&#xD;
           and subsequently prevents the augmentation of the nasal response to nasal challenge with&#xD;
           antigen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. that the azelastine in Dymista reduces the effects of released histamine&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address these hypotheses we will perform a 3-way, randomized, placebo-controlled, and&#xD;
      crossover trial. We will recruit 20 asymptomatic seasonal allergic rhinitis patients outside&#xD;
      of the relevant season. The subjects will receive placebo, fluticasone propionate and&#xD;
      Dymista. The nasal provocations will be separated by 2 weeks. Treatment will begin 15 minutes&#xD;
      before nasal provocation with ragweed or grass antigen and the treatment will continue twice&#xD;
      a day for 3 days. Nasal provocation will occur daily for three days to evaluate for priming&#xD;
      (increased sensitization with repeated antigen exposure, which mimics seasonal disease where&#xD;
      antigen exposure occurs in the setting of continued allergic inflammation). For outcome&#xD;
      measures, we will monitor both nasal symptoms after nasal provocation as well as collect&#xD;
      nasal lavage to evaluate effects on eosinophils and biomarkers of the immune response. In the&#xD;
      nasal lavage, we will quantify the number of eosinophils (a marker of cellular recruitment)&#xD;
      and measure the levels of histamine (a marker of basophil and mast cell activation), tryptase&#xD;
      (a marker of mast cell activation), albumin (a marker of vascular permeability), lactoferrin&#xD;
      (a marker of glandular activation) and ECP (a marker of eosinophil activation). Thus we&#xD;
      expect to generate information on both clinical effects and physiologic differences between&#xD;
      the treatments.&#xD;
