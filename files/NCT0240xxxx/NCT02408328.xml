  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Apnea is a common discharge-delaying diagnosis in the Newborn Intensive Care Unit. While it&#xD;
      is relatively more common in extremely premature infants, it also occurs frequently in late&#xD;
      preterm and even full term infants. Since the majority of all births include late preterm&#xD;
      infants and full term infants, the absolute number of late preterm and full term infants with&#xD;
      apnea remains significant. Evidence-based guidelines for the management of apnea in such&#xD;
      infants do not exist. Current management falls into two distinct but very different&#xD;
      categories. This study will compare these two distinct management strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study will be a prospective, randomized pilot trial to provide data regarding (a)&#xD;
      feasibility for recruitment and study protocols and (b) provide preliminary data regarding&#xD;
      efficacy of both treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary objective will be to test the hypothesis that early discharge and outpatient&#xD;
      monitoring of late preterm and term infants with apnea of prematurity results in decreased&#xD;
      length of hospital stay, is safe, and results in improved patient satisfaction, as assessed&#xD;
      by the PedsQL questionnaire and Impact on Family Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study population will include infants who meet the following criteria: (1) Born at&#xD;
      greater than or equal to 34 0/7 weeks gestation; (2) Are assigned a diagnosis of apnea,&#xD;
      bradycardia, and/or oxygen desaturations by the primary clinical team; (3) Have met all other&#xD;
      discharge criteria (i.e. feeding maturity, temperature regulation, etc.) so that&#xD;
      apnea/bradycardia/desaturation remains the final discharge issue for at least 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants enrolled in this research study will be randomized to in hospital observation versus&#xD;
      early discharge home with caffeine and a home monitor. Neither strategy is experimental as&#xD;
      both are currently utilized by neonatologists locally and nationally. A direct comparison of&#xD;
      the two treatments, however, has never been undertaken in a study. If an infant is assigned&#xD;
      to the in hospital group, they will remain in the hospital until an apnea free period of at&#xD;
      least 5 consecutive days has been established. Outpatient follow up will occur per unit&#xD;
      standard and typically includes a nursing visit and a doctor visit within 2-3 days of&#xD;
      discharge. Caregivers will be asked to complete 3 brief questionnaires at enrollment, at 1&#xD;
      month after hospital discharge, and at 6 months of age. Each questionnaire will ask about&#xD;
      topics such as satisfaction with hospital stay, quality of life, and numbers of acute care&#xD;
      visits and/or rehospitalizations. Alternatively, if an infant is assigned to the early&#xD;
      discharge group, caffeine will be given to the infant and if after a 3 day period no further&#xD;
      apnea is noted the infant will be discharged home with continued daily caffeine therapy by&#xD;
      mouth as well as a home monitor. Caffeine is a very commonly used drug in neonates and has an&#xD;
      excellent safety profile. Side effects are minimal and may infrequently consist of&#xD;
      gastroesophageal reflux. All caregivers will receive training on the use of a home monitor.&#xD;
      Initial outpatient follow up will occur per unit standard and typically includes a nursing&#xD;
      visit and a doctor visit within 2-3 days of discharge. Additionally, caregivers will be&#xD;
      contacted via telephone within 2 days to answer any questions or address any concerns&#xD;
      pertaining to apneic events, home monitor use, or caffeine therapy. Follow up in the&#xD;
      pulmonary clinic will be arranged at 42-43 weeks gestational age at which time caregivers&#xD;
      will be taught to determine the baseline frequency of monitor alarms on caffeine. At 43 weeks&#xD;
      corrected gestational age, caregivers will be instructed to discontinue caffeine therapy and&#xD;
      advised to contact the pulmonary clinic should alarm frequency increase. An outpatient&#xD;
      recorded oximetry study will be arranged at least 1 week after discontinuation of caffeine&#xD;
      therapy. Home pulse oximetry monitoring will be discontinued if no significant events are&#xD;
      recorded. Caregivers will be asked to complete 3 brief questionnaires at enrollment, at 1&#xD;
      month after discontinuation of the home monitor, and at 6 months of age. Each questionnaire&#xD;
      will ask about topics such as satisfaction with hospital stay, quality of life, and numbers&#xD;
      monitor alarms, acute care visits and/or rehospitalizations.&#xD;

      1. Study Design This is a prospective, randomized study. Our primary objective will be to&#xD;
           test the hypothesis that early discharge and outpatient monitoring of late preterm to&#xD;
           term infants with apnea of prematurity results in decreased length of hospital stay, is&#xD;
           safe and cost effective, and results in improved patient satisfaction, as assessed by&#xD;
           the PedsQL questionnaire and Impact on Family Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient Selection and Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Description of Study Treatments or Exposures/Predictors The investigators will identify&#xD;
           all qualified infants who meet eligibility criteria for enrollment, and will obtain&#xD;
           informed consent at that time. Infants will not be randomized until their apnea,&#xD;
           bradycardia, and/or oxygen desaturation has been the sole remaining discharge criteria&#xD;
           for at least 7 days. Prior to randomization, but after the receipt of written informed&#xD;
           consent, the investigators will confirm that the primary clinical team has determined&#xD;
           that there are no alternate etiologies for the apnea/bradycardia/desaturation events,&#xD;
           based on diagnostic testing or clinical judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Randomization will be stratified according to gestational age at birth to include two&#xD;
           broad categories as follows: 1) late preterm infants who are born between 34 0/7 and 36&#xD;
           6/7 weeks gestation (late preterm infants) and 2) term infants who are born at or&#xD;
           greater than 37 0/7 weeks gestation. Our aim will be to recruit at least 5 infants in&#xD;
           each treatment arm for both late preterm and full term infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Arm A will include continued inpatient monitoring of apnea, bradycardia, and/or&#xD;
           desaturation until an event free period of time (5 days per the current standard of care&#xD;
           at each participating institution) has been established and deemed appropriate for&#xD;
           discharge home per the discretion of the responsible provider. The protocol described in&#xD;
           Arm A is currently utilized as a standard of care for many infants locally and&#xD;
           nationally and is the first management option utilized at all participating&#xD;
           institutions. Arm B will include the initiation of caffeine treatment once randomization&#xD;
           has been established. Per current dosing guideline, patients will receive a one-time&#xD;
           loading dose of 20 milligrams per kilogram on day 1 with a daily maintenance dose&#xD;
           thereafter of 10 milligrams per kilogram. Monitoring of caffeine drug levels will not be&#xD;
           included in our protocol as the safety of caffeine treatment in neonates without&#xD;
           laboratory monitoring has been well established. After receiving the loading dose of&#xD;
           caffeine, infants will receive continued inpatient monitoring of&#xD;
           apnea/bradycardia/desaturation until an event free period of time (3 days per the&#xD;
           current standard of care at each participating institution) has been established and&#xD;
           deemed appropriate for discharge home per the discretion of the responsible provider.&#xD;
           Infants discharged home on caffeine therapy will receive instructions regarding use of a&#xD;
           home monitor, with alarms set to alarm for heart rate &lt;80 or &gt; 200 beats per minute, or&#xD;
           for oxygen saturation level &lt; 90%. The protocol described in Arm B is currently utilized&#xD;
           as a standard of care for many infants locally and nationally as a secondary option&#xD;
           after observation alone has resulted in a prolonged inpatient stay due to persistent&#xD;
           apnea with all other discharge criteria having been met. In a recent retrospective&#xD;
           analysis of home monitor use, the investigators found that 1 in 20 infants with apnea of&#xD;
           prematurity were discharge home with a monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Following discharge home, infants in Arm B will be contacted via telephone within 2 days&#xD;
           to answer any questions or address any concerns pertaining to apneic events, home pulse&#xD;
           oximeter use, or caffeine therapy. Follow up in the pulmonary clinic will be arranged at&#xD;
           42-43 weeks gestational age at which time caregivers will be taught to determine the&#xD;
           baseline frequency of monitor alarms on caffeine. At 43 weeks corrected gestational age,&#xD;
           caregivers will be instructed to discontinue caffeine therapy and advised to contact the&#xD;
           pulmonary clinic should alarm frequency increase. An outpatient recorded oximetry study&#xD;
           will be arranged at least 1 week after discontinuation of caffeine therapy. Home pulse&#xD;
           oximetry monitoring will be discontinued if no significant events, as previously&#xD;
           defined, are recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Follow up after discharge in both treatment arms will otherwise proceed per unit&#xD;
           protocol and typically consists of a home visiting nurse within 2-3 days of hospital&#xD;
           discharge and a primary care provider appointment within 2-3 days of hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Data Collection Methods, Assessments, Interventions and Schedule (what assessments&#xD;
           performed, how often) For infants in both arms, parents will participate in a structured&#xD;
           questionnaire at enrollment, and 1 month after hospital discharge for patients in Arm A&#xD;
           and 1 month after discontinuation of home monitor use for patients in Arm B. The&#xD;
           investigators will also contact families at 6 months of age to determine&#xD;
           rehospitalization rates, and frequency of emergency department visits related to&#xD;
           respiratory issues.&#xD;
