      This research looks at two conditions, Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) and Polycythemia Vera&#xD;
      (PV). ET causes people to produce too many blood cells called platelets and PV causes too&#xD;
      many platelets and red blood cells to be made. Platelets are particles which circulate in the&#xD;
      blood stream and normally prevent bleeding and bruising. Having too many platelets in the&#xD;
      blood increases the risk of developing blood clots, which can result in life threatening&#xD;
      events like heart attacks and strokes. When the number of red blood cells is increased in PV&#xD;
      this will slow the speed of blood flow in the body and increase the risk of developing blood&#xD;
      clots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of Part A of this study is to test the safety and tolerability of drug RG7388&#xD;
      patients and identify the recommended phase II dose in a single agent dose escalation study.&#xD;
      The investigators want to find out what effects, good and/or bad it has on the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of Part B of this study is to test the safety and tolerability of the combination&#xD;
      of RG7388 and Pegylated Interferon Alfa-2a or Pegasys in PV/ET patients from Part A who did&#xD;
      not achieve at least a partial response by the end of three cycles of single agent RG7388.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) and Polycythemia Vera (PV) have been difficult diseases to&#xD;
      treat. RG7388 is a selective inhibitor of the p53-MDM2 binding that frees p53 from negative&#xD;
      control and activates the p53 pathway in cancer cells, leading to cell cycle arrest and&#xD;
      apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. It has been used to treat solid tumors and Acute Myelogenous&#xD;
      Leukemia (AML) in clinical trials. Pegasys is a drug that is the standard of care for&#xD;
      patients who have Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      RG7388 is a drug that is not yet approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) for the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with essential thrombocythemia or polycythemia vera. Pegasys is a drug&#xD;
      that is approved by the FDA for the treatment of CHB. The use of RG7388 alone and in&#xD;
      combination with Pegasys is experimental.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Philadelphia chromosome-negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a group&#xD;
      of hematopoietic stem cell malignancies that include polycythemia vera (PV), essential&#xD;
      thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). PV and ET can evolve into&#xD;
      myelofibrosis, termed post PV/ET MF. ET, PV and PMF have variable tendencies to transform to&#xD;
      blast phase disease with a dismal prognosis. JAK2V617F is a point activating mutation&#xD;
      resulting in the constitutive activity of the JAK-STAT pathway within hematopoietic cells in&#xD;
      approximately 96%, 50%, and 50% of patients with PV, ET, and MF, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polycythemia Vera is characterized by an absolute increase in red cell mass. Patients with PV&#xD;
      have a median survival if untreated of approximately 18 months from the time of diagnosis and&#xD;
      treated of approximately 18 years. PV-related symptoms include headache, weakness, dizziness,&#xD;
      epigastric distress, and pruritus. PV-related signs include hypertension, gout, left upper&#xD;
      abdominal quadrant pain, high hematocrit, leukocytosis, and thrombocytosis. Major causes of&#xD;
      reduced survival include thrombosis (29%), bleeding (7%), evolution to myelofibrosis (3%),&#xD;
      transformation to acute leukemia (23%), and solid tumors (16%). PV patients are stratified&#xD;
      for risk of thrombosis by age &gt;60 and history of prior thrombotic events. Therapy for low&#xD;
      risk PV includes low dose aspirin and therapeutic phlebotomy to maintain a hematocrit &lt;45% in&#xD;
      a man and 42% in a woman. Cardiovascular risk factor modification such as weight loss,&#xD;
      control of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, and smoking cessation are also important&#xD;
      adjunctive approaches to all patients with PV. High risk patients are also treated with&#xD;
      cytoreductive therapy in the form of hydroxyurea to further reduce the risk of thrombotic&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Essential Thrombocythemia is characterized by persistent isolated thrombocytosis and tendency&#xD;
      for arterial and venous thrombosis. A similar pattern of symptoms as noted above with PV are&#xD;
      also seen in patients with ET. The median survival of patients with ET is similar to that of&#xD;
      age and sex matched cohort and in some patients is limited by thrombotic complications (22%),&#xD;
      evolution to MF (10%), and acute leukemia (2%) (Barbui. J Clin Oncol. 2011; 29(23):3179).&#xD;
      Risk stratification for occurrence of thrombosis is based on age &gt;60 years and/or history of&#xD;
      thrombosis. Additionally, cardiovascular risk factors and persistent thrombocytosis &gt;1.5 x&#xD;
      109/L are believed to influence thrombotic risk and leukemic transformation has been shown to&#xD;
      be associated with anemia, older age, and leukocytosis. JAK2V617F is present in approximately&#xD;
      50% of cases and helps establish a diagnosis of a clonal thrombocytosis, and has been shown&#xD;
      in some studies to predict for a higher risk of thrombosis and potential for transformation&#xD;
      to PV. Management is aimed at reducing thrombotic risk with the use of low dose aspirin in&#xD;
      low risk patients (no risk factors) and cytoreductive therapy in high risk patients (at least&#xD;
      one risk factor). Hydroxyurea, anagrelide, and interferon (IFN) have all been used to&#xD;
      maintain a platelet count below 400 x 109/L in patients with a history of thrombosis&#xD;
      (secondary prophylaxis). Currently, hydroxyurea is considered standard of care for high risk&#xD;
      ET patients based on the results of the PT-1 study which demonstrated superiority of&#xD;
      hydroxyurea over anagrelide in arterial thrombosis risk reduction and worsening marrow&#xD;
      reticulin fibrosis in patients receiving anagrelide (Harrison N Engl J Med. 2005;353(1):33).&#xD;
      Hydroxyurea is associated with a risk of oral and skin ulcers, rash, and unacceptable&#xD;
      myelosuppression that can sometimes limit use in patients with ET/PV. Additionally, some&#xD;
      patients are unable to achieve adequate control of blood counts at doses below 2000 mg/daily&#xD;
      and this has been termed &quot;resistance&quot;. Importantly, although a theoretical concern of&#xD;
      leukemogenic potential of hydroxyurea exists, based on the mechanism of action of this&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic agent, there are no definitive prospective studies clearly documenting an&#xD;
      increased risk of leukemic transformation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, a renewed interest in interferon-α for the treatment of PV as an alternative&#xD;
      therapeutic approach has led to the evaluation of pegylated interferon-α 2a (Pegasys, Roche)&#xD;
      in several phase II studies. Pegasys has an improved toxicity profile over intron-a and can&#xD;
      be self-administered by the patient on a weekly basis. Currently, Pegasys is being evaluated&#xD;
      in two large international trials within the myeloproliferative disorder research consortium&#xD;
      (MPD-RC). The MPD-RC 111 study is a phase II study intended to evaluate the response by&#xD;
      European LeukemiaNet (ELN) criteria in patients with high risk ET/PV who are intolerant or&#xD;
      resistant to hydroxyurea therapy treated with Pegasys. In addition, patients with documented&#xD;
      JAK2V617F and splanchnic vein thrombosis are also eligible for this clinical trial. MPD-RC&#xD;
      112 is a phase III study for newly diagnosed high risk PV/ET patients in which patients are&#xD;
      randomized to either Pegasys or hydroxyurea with a primary endpoint of response rate&#xD;
      comparison between the two treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of intron-a (rIFN-α) and Pegasys has been extensively studied in patients with PV and&#xD;
      reported rates of discontinuation in the first year of therapy range from 14-40%. Objective&#xD;
      hematologic responses are seen in approximately 80% of treated patients and achievement in&#xD;
      complete phlebotomy free state in 60% of PV patients. Trials of Pegasys in the treatment of&#xD;
      PV have further demonstrated major molecular responses of 19% and complete eradication of&#xD;
      JAK2V617F in 14-24% of patients. Although hematologic remission can often be achieved within&#xD;
      months of starting rIFN-α treatment, molecular responses require longer term administration&#xD;
      and are rarely seen before completion of 12 months of therapy. Additionally, sustained&#xD;
      molecular remissions have been documented in patients that have discontinued therapy for up&#xD;
      to 30 months of follow up. In a retrospective review of 118 MPN patients receiving Pegasys&#xD;
      throughout multiple MPN centers included 55 PV patients with an ORR of 87% (54% CR, 33% PR)&#xD;
      by ELN criteria [21]. In this review, the most common non-hematologic toxicities were Grade&#xD;
      1-3 fatigue in 24 patients (20%), Grade 1 liver function test (LFT) elevation in 7 (6%), and&#xD;
      Grade 1-2 skin/allergic reaction in 6 (5%). Adverse effects leading to discontinuation were&#xD;
      primarily non-hematologic, although one patient (&lt;1%) discontinued Pegasys therapy due to&#xD;
      Grade 2 anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the biological mechanism of recombinant IFN in the treatment of PV is not completely&#xD;
      understood, evidence to suggest promotion of immunoregulatory cell function, inhibition of&#xD;
      angiogenesis, induction of pro-apoptotic gene expression, alteration of the bone marrow&#xD;
      microenvironment, suppression of hematopoietic progenitor cells, and increase cycling of&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) has been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last several years, oral small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors of JAK2 have been&#xD;
      tested in both pre-clinical and clinical trials of patients with MPNs including PV/ET. These&#xD;
      agents have demonstrated remarkable responses in terms of reduction in splenomegaly and&#xD;
      correction of leukocytosis, erythrocytosis, and thrombocytosis. However, mature follow up of&#xD;
      PV patients treated with JAK2 inhibitors evaluating reduction in thrombotic risk and&#xD;
      evolution to MF is not known. Currently, Ruxolitinib (Jakafi) is being evaluated in a phase&#xD;
      III study in patients with high risk PV that are refractory/intolerant to hydroxyurea&#xD;
      [Response trial: NCT01243944].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tumor suppressor p53 plays an integral role in the regulation of the cell cycle,&#xD;
      apoptosis, DNA repair, and senescence. Fifty percent of cancers are found to have&#xD;
      inactivating mutations of p53. Although, inactivating mutations of p53 are uncommon in the&#xD;
      chronic phases of MPNs, they increase in frequency in the blast phase of MPNs. The p53&#xD;
      pathway can also be down-regulated in MPN cells that express wild-type p53 through&#xD;
      alternative pathways. Over-expression of the ubiquitin ligase murine double minute 2 (MDM2;&#xD;
      HDM2 in humans) is a regulator of wild type p53 through a variety of different mechanisms.&#xD;
      MDM2 1) promotes proteosomal degradation and 2) inhibits p53 transcription, and 3) inhibits&#xD;
      transactivation 4) facilitates export from the nucleus. Inhibition of MDM2 is expected to&#xD;
      release the negative regulation of p53 and ultimately promote tumor suppressor function. MDM2&#xD;
      overexpression can be a consequence of gene amplification, increased transcription, and&#xD;
      increased translation. It has previously been shown that in primary hematopoietic cells from&#xD;
      patients with JAK2V617F PV, reduced expression of p53 is a result of increased La autoantigen&#xD;
      expression leading to increased translation of MDM2. It would appear that JAK2V617F induces&#xD;
      this ribonucleoprotein and furthermore, La protein expression can be down-regulated by in&#xD;
      vitro JAK2 inhibitor treatment. Lu et al demonstrated increased MDM2 expression and reduced&#xD;
      p53 levels in JAK2V617F-positive PV CD34+ cells. The physical structure and interaction of&#xD;
      p53 and MDM2 is known and has allowed for the development of small molecule inhibitors of&#xD;
      MDM2-p53 interaction. Nutlin-3, a small molecule antagonist of MDM2, was shown to inhibit the&#xD;
      proliferation of PV CD34+ cells through increased p53 mediated apoptosis. Moreover, in vitro&#xD;
      combination of low doses of Pegasys with nutlin-3 resulted in selective and significant&#xD;
      inhibition of JAK2V67F-positive CD34+ PV colony formation compared to normal colony&#xD;
      formation. Thus, MDM2 appears to be a novel therapeutic target in JAK2V617F-positive PV and&#xD;
      ultimately may prove to be most effective when used in combination with Pegasys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RG7388 is an MDM2-p53 binding cell cycle inhibitor (antiproliferative) and is expected to be&#xD;
      myelosuppressive at sufficiently high doses. Nonclinical safety findings with RG7388 that may&#xD;
      have potential clinical relevance include thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, as well as&#xD;
      general pancytopenia, and effects on liver function parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical experience to date suggests a dose relationship for RG7388 and gastrointestinal AEs&#xD;
      with increased incidence of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea at higher dose levels;&#xD;
      gastrointestinal prophylaxis with anti-emetics is recommended. Cytopenias, manifesting as&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, occurring at higher dose levels appear to be related to&#xD;
      exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iancu-Rubin et al have investigated the biological effect of RG7112 (first generation MDM2&#xD;
      inhibitor) induced p53-MDM2 disruption on megakaryopoiesis and platelet production in order&#xD;
      to better elucidate the mechanism of treatment associated thrombocytopenia (ASH 2012). Bone&#xD;
      marrow derived CD34+ cells exposed to RG7112 for 7 days generated fewer viable cells, fewer&#xD;
      CFU-MK colonies as compared to untreated cells. Based on these findings, it would appear that&#xD;
      RG7112 impacts megakaryopoiesis by two potential mechanisms: 1) Impairing the ability of&#xD;
      CD34+ cells to generate MK precursors due to increased apoptosis; 2) Limiting DNA synthesis&#xD;
      and polyploidization during the late stages of MK development due to pharmacological&#xD;
      activation of p53. A combination of these two effects may provide an explanation for&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia observed in patients receiving this drug and suggests that p53 plays an&#xD;
      important role in normal human thrombocytopoiesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study NP27872 is a multi-center, open-label, first-in-human, Phase I dose-escalation study of&#xD;
      single agent RG7388, a small molecule MDM2 antagonist, administered orally in patients with&#xD;
      advanced malignancies except leukemia. The first patient received RG7388 on 15 November 2011.&#xD;
      As of 13 September 2012, 51 patients have been enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluable PK data is available for 22 patients in Study NP27872. There has been no evidence&#xD;
      of significant accumulation (defined as a mean ratio of area under the curve [AUC]τ [on Day&#xD;
      15 or 5] to AUCinf [on Day 1] &gt; 2) observed in the study thus far, except for one patient who&#xD;
      exhibited a long half-life (t½) and consequently had an accumulated drug exposure that&#xD;
      increased 5-fold from Day 1 to Day 5. This was possibly due to concomitant controlled-release&#xD;
      oxycodone, as opioids are known to cause delayed gastric emptying and decreased intestinal&#xD;
      motility. In addition, data from the study demonstrate an approximately linear dose-exposure&#xD;
      (Day 1 maximum plasma concentration [Cmax]) relationship in RG7388 with moderately high&#xD;
      inter-patient variability without an absorption plateau to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Macrophage inhibitory cytokine (MIC-1, a secreted protein that is strongly induced by&#xD;
      activated p53) serum levels has been used to assess pharmacodynamic (PD) effects in this&#xD;
      Phase I study. Analysis of patients on 100 to 800 mg/day of RG7388 showed that the minimum&#xD;
      level for p53 induction occurs at a dose of 100 mg/day or a corresponding plasma level of 500&#xD;
      ng/mL of RG7388. Preliminary analysis of PK and safety data showed that there is an apparent&#xD;
      PK/PD relationship between an AUC per cycle and Cycle 1 platelet nadir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the data cutoff of 13 September 2012, 51 patients with advanced malignancies had received&#xD;
      R05503781 in Study NP27872. Fifty patients experienced at least 1 adverse event (AE) and 11&#xD;
      patients experienced at least 1 serious adverse event (SAE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirteen SAEs in patients (white blood cell count decreased, platelet count decreased, 2&#xD;
      cases of neutrophil count decreased, febrile neutropenia, 5 cases of thrombocytopenia, 2&#xD;
      cases of neutropenia, and diarrhea) were considered by the investigator to be probably&#xD;
      related to study treatment; 4 SAEs (2 cases of febrile neutropenia, urinary tract infection,&#xD;
      and anemia) were considered possibly related; 1 SAE (lung infection) was considered remotely&#xD;
      related; and the other 6 SAEs (infection, sciatica, non-cardiac chest pain, dyspnea, wrist&#xD;
      fracture, and neutropenia) were considered unrelated. Three patients died due to disease&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eleven patients across all groups and schedules had at least 1 event considered a dose&#xD;
      limiting toxicity (DLT): a treatment-related SAE of Grade 3 febrile neutropenia, a&#xD;
      treatment-related SAE of Grade 4 febrile neutropenia, a treatment-related SAE of Grade 4&#xD;
      platelet count decreased, 3 cases of treatment-related SAEs of Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, a&#xD;
      treatment-related AE of Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, 3 cases of treatment-related AEs of Grade 4&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia, a treatment-related AE of Grade 4 neutropenia, a treatment-related SAE of&#xD;
      Grade 4 neutropenia, a treatment-related AE of Grade 3 diarrhea, 2 cases of treatment-related&#xD;
      AEs of Grade 3 nausea, and a treatment related AE of Grade 3 vomiting. Six patients&#xD;
      experienced 8 AEs that led to withdrawal from treatment: 1 (Grade 3 AE of cataracts) was&#xD;
      considered remotely related to study treatment, 4 (Grade 4 AE of thrombocytopenia/Grade 3 SAE&#xD;
      of febrile neutropenia, Grade 2 AE of neutropenia, Grade 3 SAE of febrile neutropenia) were&#xD;
      considered possibly related to study treatment, and 3 (Grade 4 SAE of neutropenia, Grade 4&#xD;
      SAE of thrombocytopenia/Grade 4 SAE of neutrophil count decreased) were considered probably&#xD;
      related to study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RG7388 is representative of an entirely new branch of the nutlin family of MDM2 antagonists&#xD;
      and the second agent with this mechanism of action sponsored by Roche. As with the lead&#xD;
      compound (RO5045337), RG7388 binds selectively to the p53 site on the surface of the MDM2&#xD;
      molecule in vitro with high affinity and can effectively displace p53 from MDM2, leading to&#xD;
      stabilization and accumulation of p53 protein and activation of the p53 pathway. RG7388 is&#xD;
      from a different chemical series compared to the lead compound and binds with higher potency&#xD;
      and selectivity to the MDM2 protein. This follow-on compound has substantially improved&#xD;
      pharmacological properties. Preclinical models predict superior efficacy of RG7388 in the&#xD;
      clinic at lower doses and exposures. Compared to the lead molecule, lower variability may be&#xD;
      seen given that RG7388 does not have significant pH dependent solubility (fasted and&#xD;
      fed-state simulated intestinal fluid solubilities are similar). RG7388 at 0.3 μM has&#xD;
      equivalent apoptotic activity to RO5045337 at 10-fold higher (3 μM) concentration and at 25&#xD;
      mg/kg has equivalent efficacy to RO5045337 at 4-fold higher dose (100 mg/kg) and better&#xD;
      potency when given once weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RG7388 exhibits improved in vitro and in vivo potency against tumor cell lines and&#xD;
      xenografts, improved CYP inhibition profile, and 2.5- to 20-fold lower projected human&#xD;
      efficacious dose. Preclinical studies have indicated that tumors expressing wild-type p53 may&#xD;
      respond to this novel therapeutic strategy that releases p53 from MDM2 inhibition, and tumors&#xD;
      with wild-type p53 and MDM2 over-expression or amplification are likely to be the most&#xD;
      sensitive. Results from preclinical safety and toxicology studies support further exploration&#xD;
      of this compound in cancer patients. In view of the existing unmet medical need in advanced&#xD;
      cancers expressing the above molecular signature, RG7388 is believed to be a promising agent&#xD;
      that may offer a new therapeutic option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of Pegasys in combination with other targeted agents for the treatment of PV/ET would&#xD;
      allow for the administration of lower doses of Pegasys, thereby reducing dose dependent&#xD;
      toxicities. Preclinical studies by Lu et al. have demonstrated preferential inhibition of PV&#xD;
      CD34+ cell proliferation and colony formation at subtherapeutic doses of Pegasys in&#xD;
      combination with Nutlin-3 [33]. Pegasys increases p53 expression through enhanced&#xD;
      transcriptional activity via the p38 Map kinase pathway and Nutlin-3 prevents p53 degradation&#xD;
      via interruption of the MDM2-p53 interaction [34]. Due to the common downstream target effect&#xD;
      of increased tumor suppressor p53 expression with combination Pegasys and Nutlin-3, lower&#xD;
      doses of each agent can be used together in PV patients. Thus, the use of RG7388 alone or in&#xD;
      combination with Pegasys would be anticipated to enhance p53 expression by different&#xD;
      mechanisms and presents a novel approach to the treatment of PV/ET.&#xD;
