  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emergency health care workers are exposed to job strain - defined by Karasek as a combination&#xD;
      of high job demands and low job control. Emergency health care work is a complex interaction&#xD;
      between stress due to life-threatening emergencies, overcrowding of the Emergency Department,&#xD;
      the lack of sleep, bad food repartition during shifts, and accumulated fatigue. However, the&#xD;
      Karasek questionnaire has never been assessed for Emergency Health Care workers. Furthermore,&#xD;
      the variation of results during the career has never been assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same measures will be repeated every 5 year to assess long term changes in subjective and&#xD;
      objective measures of stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study's main objective is the creation of an Emergency Health Care worker's cohort to&#xD;
      assess the evolution of the Karasek questionnaire during the follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the evaluation of the food intake before, during and after a nightshift.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the evaluation of other questionnaires&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic stress at work is a public health problem increasing morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      Emergency physicians is particularly an at risk population. Indeed, their work is a complex&#xD;
      interaction between stress due to life-threatening emergencies, the lack of sleep and&#xD;
      accumulated fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A way of measuring stress at work is the use of self-reported psychological questionnaire.&#xD;
      Among them, the Job control demand model from Karasek is widely used to evaluate psychosocial&#xD;
      factors at work. The Karasek job strain model has been assessed in 25 000 workers in the&#xD;
      Sumer study and allowed to classify the main types of occupations. However, no data regarding&#xD;
      emergency physicians scores at the Karasek questionnaire were available, even though burnout&#xD;
      exposure is a well-known problematic among health care workers. This absence is particularly&#xD;
      unfortunate as emergency physicians often needs to deals with life threatening emergency in a&#xD;
      short amount of time, following regularly long and craving shifts. A preliminary study with a&#xD;
      low sample size reported in concrete terms the atypical &quot;out of limit&quot; situations of&#xD;
      emergency physicians, with a decision latitude among the lowest and the highest psychological&#xD;
      demand ever reported. Moreover, variation of stress at work has been linked with professional&#xD;
      experiences. Karasek questionnaire is supposed to assess a long-term stable perception of&#xD;
      work, despite the absence of study comparing Karasek scores within different conditions in&#xD;
      the same participant. It is also important to explore protective factors that might help&#xD;
      alleviate perceived stress and that are quite easy to integrate into medical organizations or&#xD;
      in daily lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, several biomarkers of stress have been proposed. Among them, our team previously&#xD;
      highlighted the potential of DHEAS to assess stress, due to its stability (steroid) and its&#xD;
      long half-life of 16 hours. To our knowledge, the relationships between biomarkers of stress&#xD;
      and the Karasek job strain model have never been investigated. Comparisons between emergency&#xD;
      health care workers are also lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the general aim of this study is to enhance psychological well-being in emergency&#xD;
      physicians. The primary objective is to verify our preliminary findings at Karasek scores on&#xD;
      a large sample size of emergency physicians. The secondary objectives are to evaluate whether&#xD;
      there is a change in perception of work both at short-term (on leave and after a 24-hour&#xD;
      shift) and long-term (with professional experience). We will further explore its&#xD;
      relationships with some biomarkers of stress and protective factors. Moreover, we aim to&#xD;
      compare emergency health care workers specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires and saliva collection will be performed twice: at the beginning of a day work&#xD;
      and at the end of a night work. Both measures will be recorded at the same time within each&#xD;
      participant, between 6.30 am and 8.30 am depending of the health care workers. The time&#xD;
      required by participant is evaluated to about 15min each time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same measures will be repeated every 5 year to assess long term changes in subjective and&#xD;
      objective measures of stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population description will be achieved with descriptive statistics. Continuous variables&#xD;
      will be presented as mean and standard deviation, under the normality of distribution&#xD;
      condition (Shapiro-Wilk needed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis will be mainly descriptive and will express (as a quantitative and&#xD;
      categorical variables) the perception scores of emergency physicians work according to the&#xD;
      Karasek questionnaire, for each dimensions composing the score (decision latitude,&#xD;
      psychological demands and social support).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evolution of the Karasek questionnaire score, obtained for each dimension, will be tested&#xD;
      with a paired two-sample emergency physician's test (or nonparametric Wilcoxon test if&#xD;
      necessary). Linear regression models or aleatory effects models (as described by Klar and&#xD;
      Darlington, 2004, in Statistics in Medicine) will eventualy complete these analyzes. This&#xD;
      will permit, with multivariate analyzes and the introduction of covariates, to seek for&#xD;
      possible explanatory factors of the Karasek score and its evolution. The same process will be&#xD;
      used for quantitative parameters that will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analyses will be performed as bilateral tests with a p &lt;0.05 considered as&#xD;
      significant. Statistical analyzes will be performed using STATA 16 software (Stata&#xD;
      Corporation, College Station).&#xD;
