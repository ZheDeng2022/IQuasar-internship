  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of atopic dermatitis has increased dramatically in this years. Atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis occurs due to complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors. One&#xD;
      of the genes that consistenly linked with AD occurences is filaggrin gene (FLG gene).&#xD;
      Mutation on the gene can induce disruption in epidermal cytoskeleton aggregation which serves&#xD;
      to form protein-lipid, thereby disrupting the skin permeability to water and outside&#xD;
      particles such as allergens.8-14 Several attempts have been made to prevent the occurences&#xD;
      and progressivity of AD, one of them is LCPUFA supplementation. Until now, the clinical and&#xD;
      meta-analysis studies have shown inconsistent results, but LCPUFA intervention in early life&#xD;
      gives more consistent and protective results. In this study investigators would like to know&#xD;
      about the influence of FLG gene mutation to the occurrence of atopic dermatitis, to know the&#xD;
      composition of LCPUFA in early life in order to see protective effects of several LCPUFA, to&#xD;
      see the influences of FADS1 and FADS2 gene polymorphism towards LCPUFA concentration from&#xD;
      umbilical artery and buccal swab in early life and at the time AD occurs, to know about the&#xD;
      diet at the time of AD occurrence, and to know the role of the ratio of DHA towards AA level&#xD;
      in the development of AD due to their antagonistic effects, and to see the interactions&#xD;
      between FLG gene, FADS gene and LCPUFA level in the development of AD.&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional design is used to know the role of FADS1 and FADS2 gene&#xD;
      polymorphism in LCPUFA composition at birth (from umbilical artery and buccal swab), Extended&#xD;
      cross-sectional designed is used to look at FLG gene mutation effect as the predictor of the&#xD;
      emergence of atopic dermatitis, FADS1 and FADS2 gene polymorphism role in atopic dermatitis&#xD;
      occurences, the role of DHA intake and DHA to AA ratio in preventing atopic dermatitis&#xD;
      occurences in the first year of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION Target population is healthy term newborns. Affordable population is healthy&#xD;
      term newborns in Jakarta. Study samples are healthy term newborns in Jakarta born in Primary&#xD;
      Health Care in Kemayoran District, Central Jakarta whose parents consent to take part in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Briefly, filaggrin gene mutation and FADS1 and FADS2 polymorphism will be examined&#xD;
      from umbilical blood and LCPUFA level will be measured from umbilical artery and buccal swab&#xD;
      in 400 newborns. The Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) from Indonesian Health Research and&#xD;
      Development Institution (Badan Penelitian dan Pengembangan Kesehatan Republik&#xD;
      Indonesia/LITBANGKES) will be included. Genotyping will be done by using iPLEX Gold chemistry&#xD;
      (Sequenom) and MALDI-TOF (matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight) as the&#xD;
      methods to detect allele differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every month, breastfeeding; each duration of breastfeeding; formula intake; how much and what&#xD;
      kind of formula given, if any (regular formula, hypoallergenic formula); will be monitored.&#xD;
      At the time complementary feeding to breast milk starts, dietary analysis by Food Frequency&#xD;
      Questionnaire (FFQ), and monitoring of body weight, length, head circumference and skin&#xD;
      condition will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If parents complain about the presence of skin disorders or there is a suspicion of AD&#xD;
      occurfence, investigator's team will ask and accompany parents and subject to Dermatologist.&#xD;
      If subject can not come, a home visit will be done, and photograph will be taken. The&#xD;
      dermatologist will later confirm the diagnosis through the photo. LCPUFA level measurement&#xD;
      will be done once more through buccal swab at the time atopic dermatitis occurs or at the end&#xD;
      of the monitoring for subjects who do not acquire AD.&#xD;
