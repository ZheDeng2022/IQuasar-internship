  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effectiveness of intranasal (IN) ketamine compared to standard&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) ketamine administration for simple reductions of orthopaedic injuries in the&#xD;
      paediatric population. The aim is to assess if IN administration is equivalent to the current&#xD;
      standard of care, IV. The population to be studied is children 5-17 years of age who require&#xD;
      a simple orthopaedic reduction. Following a double dummy approach to overcome the difficulty&#xD;
      in masking interventions, each participant will recieve both IV and IN interventions, only&#xD;
      one of which will be the real drug. Procedural conscious sedation (PCS) will be assessed&#xD;
      using the University of Michigan Sedation Scale (UMSS).&#xD;

      Randomization and concealment of allocation will be pharmacy-controlled using a&#xD;
      computer-based random number generator. The treating physician, research assistant, and&#xD;
      participant will be blinded to the intervention. Eligible participants will be randomized in&#xD;
      a 1:1 allocation ratio with a stratified block design of six to either (1) IN ketamine (each&#xD;
      single dose, 8 mg/kg prepared in 0.9% NS in 3 mL syringe and atomizer, to a maximum of 1.5&#xD;
      mL) PLUS IV 0.9% NS 0.02 mL/kg or (2) IV ketamine (single dose, 1 mg/kg, to a maximum 100 mg)&#xD;
      PLUS intranasal 0.9% NS 0.08 mL/kg divided to both nares. Due to the perceptible differences&#xD;
      in interventional routes, each participant will receive both IV and IN interventions using&#xD;
      this double-dummy approach. For IN dose volumes less than or equal to 0.5 mL, the entire dose&#xD;
      will be delivered into 1 nostril and for doses greater than 0.5 mL, the dose will be divided&#xD;
      equally between both nares. Adjuctive sedation will be given as needed in the form of IV&#xD;
      ketamine, 1 mg/kg every 10 minutes for participants who do not achieve adequate sedation at&#xD;
      20 minutes (UMSS score of 4). A figure of the atomizer device used to deliver the IN agent&#xD;
      has been uploaded. Eligible participants (defined in section 2.5 above) will be identified by&#xD;
      the treating physician after viewing the radiographs and performing a clinical assessment.&#xD;
      The physician will then inform a research assistant (RA) that the participant is eligible.&#xD;
      The RA will then seek informed consent and explain the protocol to the family. Baseline&#xD;
      demographic information will be obtained. Informed consent for PCS and a pre-anesthetic&#xD;
      assessment will be performed by the treating physician in accordance with the usual standard&#xD;
      of care. UMSS scores will be obtained by a trained RA at 5 minutes pre-intervention,&#xD;
      intervention (0 minutes) and every 5 minutes thereafter for 60 minutes post-intervention or&#xD;
      until the participant is ambulatory and drinking well, whichever is longer. Participants will&#xD;
      receive standard monitoring of oxygen saturation, blood pressure, respiratory rate, apnea,&#xD;
      heart rate, and rash by the attending nurse and physician every 5 minutes as per the usual&#xD;
      standard of care. The usual standard of care also includes monitoring post-anesthetic for the&#xD;
      presence of known idiosyncratic effects of ketamine that include vomiting, seizure, headache,&#xD;
      emergence reaction, and hypersensitivity. The RA will obtain this information from the&#xD;
      nursing record at discharge. Immediately prior to discharge, the RA will also record the&#xD;
      duration of stay in the ED and parental satisfaction with PCS. 1. Chiaretti et al. 2011.&#xD;
