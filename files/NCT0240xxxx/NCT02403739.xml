      Simulated growth data will be shown to clinicians in two formats - (1) as weight vs.age&#xD;
      charts, (2) as weight Z-score vs. age charts. Clinicians will be asked to identify whether&#xD;
      growth is too fast, too slow, or normal. The test will take a total of 10 minutes.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Optimization of growth is essential for preterm infants. Optimum post-natal growth&#xD;
      has been shown to improve long-term developmental outcomes. Close monitoring of weight gain,&#xD;
      including early identification of growth faltering, is an important part of appropriate&#xD;
      nutritional management in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current practices in neonatal intensive care units involve the routine use of growth charts&#xD;
      to track and identify patterns in the growth of preterm infants. Perhaps the most popular&#xD;
      growth chart in use today is the Fenton Growth Chart. To interpret this chart, a patient's&#xD;
      growth curve is plotted over a set of standard curves (typically representing the 10th, 25th,&#xD;
      50th, 75th and 90th weight-for-age centile). The curves are then visually compared to&#xD;
      identify patterns in growth (adequate, slow, or catch-up growth). Patterns in neonatal growth&#xD;
      may be subtle and current growth curves may be prone to misinterpretation. This may be due to&#xD;
      biases inherent in the human visual perception system, including the difficulty in visually&#xD;
      estimating slopes and angles between two curves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An improved growth chart would use horizontal lines rather than curves, and would have no&#xD;
      oblique lines to skew visual perception. Z-score growth charts accomplish this. Z-score&#xD;
      growth charts are created using the same standardized data used to create the Fenton Growth&#xD;
      Chart. Z-scores represent standard deviation scores. Rather than using a set of standard&#xD;
      curves to represent average healthy growth, the z-score chart uses a single horizontal line.&#xD;
      This allows for easier comparison when plotting a patient's weights over time. Such charts&#xD;
      may lead to more accurate interpretation of overall growth patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compares the accuracy of interpretation of the growth data using the same&#xD;
      standard - once as presented using traditional weight-vs.-age charts, and again using the&#xD;
      same data displayed as Z-score vs age charts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will include UC Davis Medical Center healthcare personnel who interpret growth charts for&#xD;
      preterm infants. This may include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Attending Neonatologists&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Attending Pediatricians&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dietitians&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical Students&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neonatal Fellows&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neonatal Nurse Practitioners&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pediatric Residents This study will exclude persons who do not routinely interpret&#xD;
           growth charts for preterm infants as part of their clinical responsibilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NUMBER OF SUBJECTS This will be a single center study. The sample size needed for 80% power&#xD;
      with an alpha of 0.05 is estimated to be at least 40. Approaching 45-50 providers should be&#xD;
      sufficient to achieve this number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT METHODS Healthcare providers who meet the inclusion criteria will be approached&#xD;
      on an individual and/or group basis. We may attempt to hold a meeting (perhaps at lunch time)&#xD;
      when volunteers may participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COMPENSATION TO SUBJECTS If there is a meeting held at lunchtime for volunteers to&#xD;
      participate in this study, there may be a small lunch provided (such as sandwiches, pizza&#xD;
      and/or soft drinks). When subjects are approached on an individual basis, there will be no&#xD;
      compensation offered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY TIMELINES&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The duration of an individual subject's participation in the study: less than one hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The duration anticipated to enroll all study subjects: three to six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The estimated date for the investigators to complete this study (complete primary&#xD;
           analyses): Less than six months&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY ENDPOINTS Primary endpoint: after 40-50 persons have completed the study. Primary or&#xD;
      secondary safety endpoints: there are no foreseeable safety issues with participating in this&#xD;
      questionnaire based study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURES INVOLVED&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study subjects will be asked to view a brief presentation. This will describe Fenton&#xD;
           Preterm and Z-score growth charts, and review how they are interpreted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothetical (i.e. dummy data) for 10-20 infants will be displayed both as weigh vs. age&#xD;
           charts and as Z-score vs age charts. The data will consist of 2 points approximately&#xD;
           1-2w apart. Subjects will be asked whether the growth between the two points is &quot;normal&quot;&#xD;
           (paralleling centile lines on the weight vs age charts, or horizontal on the Z-score vs&#xD;
           age charts), &quot;slower than normal&quot; or &quot;faster than normal&quot;). The order of presentation of&#xD;
           the charts will be randomized&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will record their interpretation of the growth data on a sheet (marking a box&#xD;
           for &quot;normal&quot;, &quot;faster than normal&quot; or &quot;slower than normal&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of the presentation subjects will be asked to record their level of training&#xD;
           (medical student, resident, fellow, NNP, neonatal attending, or other) on the sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A space will be provided on the datasheet for subjects to record any impression of the&#xD;
           charts they may wish to share.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be provided unmarked envelopes to put their datasheets in to return them&#xD;
           to the investigators (so investigators will be unaware of the answers, or whether the&#xD;
           subjects completed the datasheet)&#xD;
