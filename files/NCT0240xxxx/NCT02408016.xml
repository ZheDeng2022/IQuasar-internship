    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of genetically modified T cells&#xD;
      in treating patients with stage III-IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or mesothelioma.&#xD;
      Many types of cancer cells, including NSCLC and mesothelioma, but not most normal cells, have&#xD;
      a protein called Wilms tumor (WT)1 on their surfaces. This study takes a type of immune cell&#xD;
      from patients, called T cells, and modifies their genes in the laboratory so that they are&#xD;
      programmed to find cells with WT1 and kill them. The T cells are then given back to the&#xD;
      patient. Cyclophosphamide and aldesleukin may also stimulate the immune system to attack&#xD;
      cancer cells. Giving cyclophosphamide and aldesleukin with laboratory-treated T cells may&#xD;
      help the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the safety, and potential toxicities associated with treating patients with&#xD;
      metastatic NSCLC and mesothelioma with polyclonal autologous central memory and naive cluster&#xD;
      of differentiation (CD)8+ T cells that have been transduced to express a WT1-specific T-cell&#xD;
      receptor (TCR) (Arm 1 and Arm 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the feasibility of treating patients with metastatic NSCLC and mesothelioma&#xD;
      with polyclonal autologous central memory and naive CD8+ T cells that have been transduced to&#xD;
      express a WT1-specific TCR (Arm 1 and Arm 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine and compare the in vivo persistence in blood and tumor of transferred&#xD;
      polyclonal autologous central memory and naive CD8+ T cells that have been transduced to&#xD;
      express a WT1-specific TCR (Arm 1 and Arm 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the antitumor efficacy for patients with metastatic NSCLC and mesothelioma (Arm&#xD;
      1), as measured by time to progression (TTP) based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in&#xD;
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the in vivo functional capacity of adoptively transferred polyclonal autologous&#xD;
      CD8+ T cells that have been transduced to express a WT1-specific TCR, and assess the&#xD;
      acquisition of phenotypic characteristics associated with T cell exhaustion (Arm 1 and Arm&#xD;
      2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine the migration to tumor sites of adoptively transferred polyclonal autologous&#xD;
      CD8+ T cells that have been transduced to express a WT1-specific TCR (Arm 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Evaluate the tumor response and T cell infiltration in tumors of patients with stage IIIA&#xD;
      NSCLC treated in the neo-adjuvant setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of autologous WT1-TCRc4 gene-transduced&#xD;
      CD8-positive Tcm/Tn lymphocytes followed by a phase II study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 3&#xD;
      treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I, STAGE I: Patients receive autologous WT1-TCRc4 gene-transduced CD8-positive Tcm/Tn&#xD;
      lymphocytes intravenously (IV) on days 0 and 14, cyclophosphamide IV on days 11 and 12, and&#xD;
      aldesleukin (IL-2) subcutaneously (SC) twice daily (BID) for 14 days. Patients who have&#xD;
      received radiation to the chest/lung tissue may receive T lymphocytes 90 days after&#xD;
      completion of radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I, STAGE II: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on days -3 and -2, autologous WT1-TCRc4&#xD;
      gene-transduced CD8-positive Tcm/Tn lymphocytes IV on day 0, and aldesleukin SC BID for 14&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive autologous WT1-TCRc4 gene-transduced CD8-positive Tcm/Tn lymphocytes&#xD;
      IV between 24-96 hours after the last dose of chemotherapy and receive aldesleukin SC BID for&#xD;
      14 days. Patients then undergo surgery within 3-4 weeks after the T-cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months and then&#xD;
      annually for 14 years.&#xD;
