  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hardened plaque located in the carotid arteries can cause stroke or transient ischemic attack&#xD;
      (TIA). This type of plaque is linked to unstable free-floating thrombi (FFT). FFT are blood&#xD;
      clots that form in a blood vessel, and are at the highest risk for travelling within the&#xD;
      bloodstream and causing strokes. Physicians are able to see this type of plaque with computed&#xD;
      tomographic angiography (CTA) but FFT look very similar to stable types of plaque that do not&#xD;
      require urgent treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Distinguishing between these plaques is important because it affects the choice and urgency&#xD;
      of treatment that patients receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers have found a promising visual marker on CTA scans. The goal of this study is&#xD;
      to determine if this visual marker seen on CTA scans will help to distinguish FFT plaque from&#xD;
      stable plaque.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Atherosclerotic plaques at the origin of the internal carotid artery (ICA) can cause&#xD;
      TIA/stroke, and are well-visualized with CT angiography (CTA). Those plaques associated with&#xD;
      unstable free-floating thrombi (FFT) are at highest risk for embolization and stroke.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, FFT have a similar appearance to stable ulcerated plaques on CTA: both appear&#xD;
      as intraluminal filling defects of varying length and morphology. Distinguishing these&#xD;
      entities is critical as it affects the choice and urgency of treatment (antithrombotics vs&#xD;
      revascularization). Using a retrospective study, we have previously proposed a promising CTA&#xD;
      imaging marker to distinguish FFT from stable ulcerated plaque. It is hoped that after the&#xD;
      data is collected from this prospective study to one day initiate a multi-centre study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our prior research, we proposed a reasonable &quot;gold standard&quot; for FFT diagnosis. We&#xD;
      followed patients presenting with circular filling defects on CTA (doughnut signs) suspicious&#xD;
      for either FFT or ulcerated plaque with serial CTAs after medical therapy. Those that&#xD;
      diminished or resolved with antithrombotic treatment (or those that unfortunately &quot;resolved&quot;&#xD;
      by embolizing distally) were presumed to be &quot;true FFT&quot; in contrast to those that remained&#xD;
      unchanged. We then assessed the performance of a variety of imaging parameters to&#xD;
      differentiate FFT from ulcerated plaque: we tested linear measurements, morphology, degree of&#xD;
      stenosis, as well as relevant clinical factors. These parameters were measured by&#xD;
      neuroradiologists as well as an innovative semi-automated shape analysis. Using a&#xD;
      retrospectively established cohort, we were able to derive 3.8 mm as an optimal&#xD;
      cranial-caudal length threshold of the filling defect that can potentially help distinguish&#xD;
      FFT from plaque, with 88% sensitivity and 86% specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will prospectively identify consecutive patients presenting with TIA/stroke within 72 hrs&#xD;
      of symptom onset with an ICA intraluminal filling defect on CTA. We will review the imaging&#xD;
      data and measure the cranial-caudal length of the filling defect. Patients will receive a&#xD;
      follow-up CTA in one week as per the current clinical standard of care, and if the defect is&#xD;
      still unresolved, a third CTA will be repeated after a second week if unresolved, and a&#xD;
      fourth at one month (research). We will measure cranial-caudal length of the filling defect&#xD;
      at each time interval, blind to the previous measurements. Resolution of the filling defect&#xD;
      at any point is diagnostic of FFT, whereas its static appearance after 1 month is diagnostic&#xD;
      of ulcerated plaque. For this pilot study, measure rate of enrolment, adherence to study&#xD;
      protocols, attrition rates, and proportion of patients with FFT. For the exploratory&#xD;
      objective, we will record treatment choice, dose, and duration.&#xD;
