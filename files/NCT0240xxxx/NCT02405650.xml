  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are major public health problems. In contrary to&#xD;
      observations in general population, higher body mass index in those with pre-existing CKD is&#xD;
      associated with lower mortality. Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) is an ongoing&#xD;
      observational study to examine the consequences of CKD with a particular focus on&#xD;
      cardiovascular illness like myocardial infarction (heart attack) and stroke. Among CRIC study&#xD;
      participants, the investigators propose to obtain visceral and subcutaneous adiposity and&#xD;
      physical fitness measures and study its associations with patient-centered outcomes. This&#xD;
      study will help the investigators understand the independent and combined effects of visceral&#xD;
      adiposity and physical fitness on cardiovascular disease, renal disease progression and death&#xD;
      among those with CKD. Further, it will identify mechanisms that could be targeted to reduce&#xD;
      the detrimental effects of visceral adiposity in those with kidney disease.&#xD;

      Obesity and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are major public health problems. Obesity&#xD;
      independent of its relationship with diabetes and hypertension is associated with the&#xD;
      development and progression of kidney disease. However, higher body mass index (BMI) in those&#xD;
      with pre-existing CKD is associated with lower mortality (obesity paradox). This may be due&#xD;
      to the inability of BMI to differentiate fat mass and muscle mass, which may have opposite&#xD;
      relationship with cardiovascular disease and death. Body fat distribution is a major factor&#xD;
      of metabolic health with metabolic abnormalities correlating better with visceral than&#xD;
      subcutaneous adipose tissue. Further, higher fitness levels among those with higher BMI is&#xD;
      associated with a lower prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and mortality that might&#xD;
      explain this obesity paradox. Therefore, among Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC)&#xD;
      study participants, the investigators propose (a) to examine whether visceral adiposity is&#xD;
      associated with a higher incidence of composite outcomes (i.e., mortality, cardiovascular&#xD;
      events, end stage renal disease, and 50% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate),&#xD;
      (b) to determine if physical fitness modifies the association between adiposity and outcomes,&#xD;
      and (c) to study whether visceral adiposity and physical fitness are associated with altered&#xD;
      adipokine profile, inflammation, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress. The study proposes&#xD;
      to enroll 526 patients with varying degrees of kidney disease from 7 clinical centers&#xD;
      involved in the CRIC study. Visceral adiposity will be measured by magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) of the abdomen using a standard protocol, and physical fitness will be measured using a&#xD;
      400 m walk test during routine CRIC study visits. Results from this study will help the&#xD;
      Investigators understand the independent and combined effects of visceral adiposity and&#xD;
      physical fitness on cardiovascular disease and kidney disease progression among CKD patients.&#xD;
      This study will also highlight potential pathways that mediate the relationship between&#xD;
      adiposity and outcomes, which will become the focus of future therapeutic investigations in&#xD;
      CKD.&#xD;
