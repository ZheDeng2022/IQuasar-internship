  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hematopoietic cell transplantation (BMT), or commonly referred to as blood and marrow&#xD;
      transplantation (BMT), is a potentially life-saving therapy for many malignant and&#xD;
      non-malignant conditions. Despite advances over the past decade, which have led to improved&#xD;
      outcomes, BMT remains an intense treatment modality often requiring prolonged inpatient-based&#xD;
      care. While many patients endure the acute complications of the procedure, it is common for&#xD;
      BMT patients and their caregivers to experience increased risk of financial and emotional&#xD;
      burden, hospital readmission, and health service utilization. This highlights the importance&#xD;
      of active involvement of BMT patients in their own health care (self-efficacy). For pediatric&#xD;
      BMT patients, parents are the primary caregivers. As such, parental activation on behalf of&#xD;
      the child (patient) plays a critical role in effective patient-parent-provider partnerships,&#xD;
      which is increasingly recognized as the optimal model for health care delivery, particularly&#xD;
      for those facing life-altering medical treatments. It is essential to develop effective&#xD;
      strategies to enhance this partnership. Health information technology (IT)-mediated tools&#xD;
      offer the potential to overcome constraints in health care delivery limited by provider time,&#xD;
      complicated health information, and financial pressures. Significant gaps in knowledge exist&#xD;
      on the use of health IT tools using low-cost and well-accepted delivery platforms in routine&#xD;
      inpatient care, especially for high-risk or critically ill populations. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that a tablet-based tool displaying personal health information could provide a&#xD;
      platform to promote caregiver (parent) activation and enhance health communication. In this&#xD;
      clinical research study, the investigators will conduct a pilot study of an educational&#xD;
      health IT system developed on a tablet (Apple iPad®) that the investigators refer to as a&#xD;
      Personalized Engagement Tool (PET) or the &quot;BMT Roadmap.&quot; The Apple iPad® was selected as the&#xD;
      platform for delivery of the educational intervention given its ergonomic features. The&#xD;
      implementation and evaluation of the BMT Roadmap information system in caregivers of children&#xD;
      undergoing BMT have been based on the generation of user (caregivers and patients) needs that&#xD;
      incorporated well-established user-centered design processes including qualitative and&#xD;
      quantitative research methods (published and unpublished data). The assembled investigators&#xD;
      represent a strong multidisciplinary team with complementary and integrated expertise who are&#xD;
      well-poised to carry out the proposed research. The Protocol or Study Team includes pediatric&#xD;
      BMT physicians, Center for Health Communications Research (CHCR) staff, health informaticist,&#xD;
      biostatistician, and psychologist. This research study is innovative because it addresses a&#xD;
      gap in the literature on the role of health IT in parent activation on behalf of the child in&#xD;
      the inpatient setting of a high-risk BMT population. The BMT Roadmap information system&#xD;
      provides a robust experimental framework for further testing the utility of other care&#xD;
      components that relate to parent activation or participation and for potential adoption in&#xD;
      other complex medical conditions. The new knowledge gained herein will thus contribute to the&#xD;
      evidence base of how health IT improves health care quality and provide the basis of further&#xD;
      study in a full-scale clinical trial.&#xD;

      PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS Title A Pilot Study of Patient and Caregiver Participation through an&#xD;
      Educational Health Information Technology System (&quot;The BMT Roadmap&quot;) in the Context of&#xD;
      Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective To evaluate the usefulness and usability of a health information technology (IT)&#xD;
      system (&quot;The BMT Roadmap&quot;). This educational system will be developed on an Apple iPad® with&#xD;
      collaborators from the School of Information, Health Informatics, and the Center for Health&#xD;
      Communications Research (CHCR). The BMT Roadmap will be used by caregivers of patients&#xD;
      hospitalized for first-time autologous (self) or allogeneic (alternative donor) blood and&#xD;
      marrow transplantation (BMT) as well as patients (age 10 years or older) who are hospitalized&#xD;
      for first time autologous or allogeneic BMT. The investigators hypothesize that parents will&#xD;
      use the BMT Roadmap to become more active participants on behalf of their child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information system will consist of 5 modules personalized to the study participant's&#xD;
      child: (1) laboratory studies, (2) medications, (3) clinical trials enrolled on, (4) health&#xD;
      care providers (BMT physicians, 7 Mott Nurses, BMT NPs, coordinators, pharmacists,&#xD;
      nutritionist, social worker), and (5) criteria for discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Caregivers: The investigators aim to enroll 10 adult caregivers of patients (0-25&#xD;
      years of age) undergoing autologous (self) or allogeneic BMT (alternative donor); and&#xD;
      Patients: 10 patients (10 years of age or older) undergoing autologous or allogeneic BMT.&#xD;
      This sample size was determined based on the patient demographics of the University of&#xD;
      Michigan Pediatric BMT Program. The number of participants who meet eligibility is&#xD;
      approximately 50 per year. The investigators plan to enroll approximately 2 adult caregivers&#xD;
      and 2 patients per month for an estimated accrual time of 5 months. This study allows for&#xD;
      concurrent enrollment in other trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design After signing an informed consent, participants will be provided with an Apple&#xD;
      iPad®. Qualitative and quantitative research methods will be used to measure the study&#xD;
      outcomes. There will be approximately 6-8 qualitative interviews per participant conducted&#xD;
      periodically from pre-BMT until 100 days post-BMT. Additionally, 15-20 qualitative interviews&#xD;
      will be conducted of BMT care providers, including physicians, nurses, pharmacists,&#xD;
      nutritionists, social worker, and psychologist to evaluate their attitudes and perceptions of&#xD;
      the BMT Roadmap information system. Quantitative survey instruments will only be administered&#xD;
      to adult participants (age 18 years or older). Caregivers with children (patients) who are&#xD;
      younger than 10 years of age may be eligible to participate even though their children are&#xD;
      too young to assent or participate themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria Caregivers: Caregiver (age 18 years or older) of a patient (0-25 years of&#xD;
      age) who is an inpatient undergoing autologous or allogeneic BMT; Patients: patient (10 years&#xD;
      or older) who is inpatient undergoing autologous or allogeneic BMT. Ability to speak and read&#xD;
      proficiently in English (the study's instruments have not been translated and validated in&#xD;
      languages other than English); Willing and able to provide informed consent; Willing to&#xD;
      comply with study procedures and reporting requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Plan This protocol is an educational intervention study (no more than minimal&#xD;
      risk). It does not include treatment of an investigation agent treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints The primary outcome measures will be the usefulness and the usability of the&#xD;
      BMT Roadmap information system. Secondary measures will include standard-of-care&#xD;
      patient-related clinical outcomes (length of stay and risk of day 30 and 100 readmission,&#xD;
      infections, transplant-related mortality, and survival).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Descriptive statistics will be calculated for each survey instrument.&#xD;
      Univariate analyses will be performed to assess associations between the instruments and&#xD;
      demographic, social, and environmental characteristics of the parent (type of insurance,&#xD;
      marital status, number of children in household), and disease-related characteristics of the&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants will be recruited by BMT RN Coordinators and physicians prior to patient&#xD;
             admission to the Pediatric BMT Unit. Caregiver (age 18 years or older) of any patient&#xD;
             eligible to undergo autologous or allogeneic BMT and any patient (age 10 years or&#xD;
             older) eligible to undergo autologous or allogeneic BMT will be recruited during the&#xD;
             &quot;Pre-Transplant Work-up&quot; stage in the outpatient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CAREGIVER PARTICIPANTS: Caregiver (age 18 years or older) of a patient who will be&#xD;
             hospitalized to undergo first-time autologous (self) or allogeneic (alternative donor)&#xD;
             BMT in the University of Michigan Mott Children's Hospital Pediatric BMT Unit. The age&#xD;
             range of patients typically transplanted in the Pediatric BMT unit is 0-25 years.&#xD;
             Caregivers with children (patients) who are younger than 10 years of age may be&#xD;
             eligible to participate even though their children are too young to assent or&#xD;
             participate themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PATIENT PARTICIPANTS: Patient (age 10 years or older) who will be hospitalized to&#xD;
             undergo first-time autologous or allogeneic BMT will be given the opportunity to&#xD;
             assent/consent and participate in the study. With his/her permission, the patient will&#xD;
             also be provided with their own iPad® BMT Roadmap information system to use.&#xD;
             Qualitative interviews will be conducted in patients (age 10 years or older) with&#xD;
             their assent/consent. However, patients (age 10-17.9 years) will not be asked to&#xD;
             complete surveys, because they have not been validated in this age group. Patients (18&#xD;
             years or older) will be asked to complete surveys. The upper age limit is typically 25&#xD;
             years on the Pediatric BMT Unit. This limit will be determined by only those patients&#xD;
             undergoing transplant in the Pediatric BMT Unit.&#xD;
