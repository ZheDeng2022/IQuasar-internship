      The purpose of this study is to measure the concentration of cells and proteins in the&#xD;
      patient's blood during administration of Nuopogen (Filgrastim), a medication that is FDA&#xD;
      approved for stem cell mobilization, in combination with a programmed pneumatic compression&#xD;
      device (PPCD) (Art-Assist Device). The Art-Assist Device is an FDA approved device that&#xD;
      promotes blood flow in the patient's legs. A patient will be prescribed this device and this&#xD;
      drug to help improve the poor circulation in his/her leg. The use of Nuopogen along with the&#xD;
      Art-Assist Device has not been approved by the FDA and is considered experimental.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is not designed to find out how well the Art-Assist Device works, nor how well the&#xD;
      drug works in mobilizing stem cells. Instead, it is a study of how well cells lining blood&#xD;
      vessels in calf respond to increases in shear stress, and how well the increase in the&#xD;
      population of certain cells in the blood stream effect how the new blood vessels will form.&#xD;
      It is important for clinical reasons, and for the purposes of this study, that the patient&#xD;
      uses the Art-Assist Device as prescribed on a daily basis as discussed with the patient's&#xD;
      doctor&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This protocol is the next clinical step in our biochemical assessment of a cell therapy&#xD;
      approach to treat Chronic Limb Threatening Ischemia (CLI). Briefly, the capability to enlarge&#xD;
      collateral arteries (&quot;arteriogenesis&quot;), and to stimulate growth of new capillaries,&#xD;
      arterioles and venules at the tissue level (&quot;angiogenesis&quot;) is innate. Investigators&#xD;
      attribute the failure for this to occur in CLI to the ischemic environment. In our first&#xD;
      protocol investigators used an external programmed pneumatic compression device (Art-Assist&#xD;
      Device) to improve hemodynamics in the limb and most importantly to provide the &quot;on-switch&quot;&#xD;
      to activate the endothelium so arteriogenesis can begin. This new protocol provides the&#xD;
      second step in improving this environment; improving the cellular deficit and protein&#xD;
      signaling. Investigators are seeking the proteomic, biochemical, and cytometry data needed to&#xD;
      refine the approach so a clinical trial can be performed. This project will use FDA approved&#xD;
      and CMS reimbursed products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neovascularization in CLI fails for hemodynamic (&quot;A&quot;) and cellular (&quot;B&quot;) reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) The hemodynamic failure caused by multi-level arterial occlusive disease leads to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Attenuation of infra-geniculate endothelial shear stress: Without this stimulus, the&#xD;
           endothelial cells lining small collateral arteries are not induced to attract and&#xD;
           capture circulating monocytes and progenitor cells that would orchestrate&#xD;
           arteriogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Impaired inflow of oxygenated nutritive blood flow into the ischemic tissue&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Impaired clearance of waste products of metabolism from the ischemic tissue&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Impaired dissemination of protein signals from the ischemic tissue that would recruit&#xD;
           pro-angiogenic reparative cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Impaired arrival of these pro-angiogenic cells to the ischemic tissue. B) Deficiency in&#xD;
           the circulating progenitor cell population: These cells participate in angiogenesis and&#xD;
           arteriogenesis. They are deficient in number and in function in CLI patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C) Impaired immunity. Even when blood flow is improved there is a population of patients that&#xD;
      still succumb to infection. Part of this relates to poor wound management, the other is&#xD;
      impaired immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our cell therapy approach is designed to address each of these. Specifically:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) The hemodynamic failure caused by multi-level arterial occlusive disease will be corrected&#xD;
      by wearing the ACI device that&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Restores the endothelial shear stress needed to activate vascular endothelium so as to&#xD;
           start the Arteriogenesis process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Increases delivery of oxygenated nutritive blood flow into the ischemic tissue&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Clears waste products of metabolism from the ischemic tissue&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Increases dissemination of protein signals from the ischemic tissue that would recruit&#xD;
           pro-angiogenic reparative cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Enhances delivery of these pro-angiogenic cells back to the ischemic tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) The deficiency in the circulating progenitor cell population will be corrected:&#xD;
&#xD;
      G-CSF (Nuopogen, Amgen Inc.) is FDA approved for progenitor/stem cell mobilization. It has&#xD;
      been used clinically as stand-alone neovascularization therapy. Investigators will use it in&#xD;
      this protocol to correct the deficiency in this vital cell population in CLI patients,&#xD;
      enhancing arteriogenesis and angiogenesis. Investigators will measure its biochemical impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C) The Impaired immunity will be addressed G-CSF (Nuopogen, Amgen Inc.) is FDA approved for&#xD;
      correcting the immunological deficit following cytotoxic chemotherapy. CLI occurs in elderly,&#xD;
      often diabetic, patients with impaired immunity. Amputations result when infections arise in&#xD;
      the forefoot and reach the mid-foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis: is that the combined use of a PPCD and G-CSF will promote arteriogenesis.&#xD;
      Investigators have limited but strong clinical evidence that this combined approach&#xD;
      dramatically improves blood flow. The recently completed IRB project (IRB#12-1198) focused on&#xD;
      the biochemistry of the PPCD. The present submission addresses the biochemical impact of the&#xD;
      PPCD and G-CSF together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B.OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: is to measure the influence of progenitor cell mobilization on the PPCD&#xD;
      proteomic profile investigators derived during our recently completed protocol (IRB #&#xD;
      12-1198). Ten CLI patients will be enrolled. All will wear the PPCD as before. All will&#xD;
      receive 10 mcg/kg of Filgrastim (Nuopogen, Amgen Inc.) for a total of 5 doses. The FDA&#xD;
      approved indication is stem cell mobilization. The dosimetry is less aggressive than the&#xD;
      product label as the dosimetry is being spread out to once every 72 hours rather than once a&#xD;
      day. The FDA has granted the PI an IND waiver for this dosing interval. As with our first&#xD;
      protocol, cytometry will yield the distribution of progenitor CD34+ and VEGFR2+ cells and&#xD;
      monocytes (CD14+). The distribution of mature circulating endothelial cells (CD31+) cells&#xD;
      will be measured as a reference point. As with our first protocol investigators will do a&#xD;
      proteomic survey measuring levels of cytokines associated with arteriogenesis, as well as&#xD;
      serum nitrite (reflection of nitric oxide synthase activity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: investigators will examine the association between these biochemical data,&#xD;
      hemodynamic testing, and clinical course (alleviation or progression of forefoot ischemic&#xD;
      rest pain and ischemic forefoot wounds) over a 6 month interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Ten CLI patients with ischemic forefoot rest pain, non-healing forefoot&#xD;
      ulceration, or dry forefoot gangrene will be recruited. They will have already undergone&#xD;
      standard of care evaluation, including hemodynamic testing and duplex ultrasound delineation&#xD;
      of the arterial anatomy in the Non-invasive Vascular Laboratory. Those with tibial artery&#xD;
      occlusive disease, with normal or corrected proximal aorto-ilio-femoral arterial anatomy,&#xD;
      will be given the option of enrollment in lieu of surgery or catheter revascularization. PPCD&#xD;
      use will continue until the presenting symptoms resolve or traditional revascularization&#xD;
      becomes necessary to achieve limb salvage. The only three amendments to our first IRB&#xD;
      submission (IRB#12-1198) are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All will receive 10 mcg/kg of Filgrastim (Nuopogen, Amgen Inc.) for a total of 5 doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The 30 day CRC visit will be replaced with a 14 day visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cytometry will also be performed on the 14 day visit. As in our first IRB submission,&#xD;
           each patient serves as his/her own control. Two &quot;pairs&quot; of blood specimens will be&#xD;
           analyzed per patient. A &quot;pair&quot; includes phlebotomy prior to and immediately after two&#xD;
           hours of PPCD. The first pair is obtained on enrollment in the CRC. The second pair will&#xD;
           be done 2 weeks later 18-24 hours after the last dose of G-CSF. The patient will return&#xD;
           for standard of care clinical evaluation, with repeat hemodynamic testing 6 months after&#xD;
           that 14 day CRC evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline visit (Vascular Surgery Clinic):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients will undergo standard of care history and physical (H&amp;P) examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Other standard of care tests will include: duplex ultrasound (DUS), Ankle and Toe&#xD;
           Pressures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Upon verification that the patient is eligible (based on the inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
           criteria), an ICF (Informed consent form), will be explained to the patient to better&#xD;
           explain and the study and ask for authorization to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day1 (at the CRC; Clinical Research Center, University of Chicago): The following procedures&#xD;
      will be done in this order:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Initial blood draws (20 ml)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Each patient will be given Nuopogen shot (10 mcg/kg) subcutaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients then will wear the PPCD in seated position for (2-hour session).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. After the 2-hour use of the PPCD, another blood draw will be done (20 ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patient will be given ample time to fill out the quality of life questionnaires and the&#xD;
           study coordinator will be available at this time to assist the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Blood samples will be sent to the Dr. T.C. HE, PhD Lab for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Days 4, 7, 10, and 13 (at Home or in clinic): The following procedures will be done:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Nurse or P.I. will administer Nuopogen shot (10 mcg/kg) subcutaneously, every 3rd day,&#xD;
           for a total of 5 Nuopogen shots.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient will continue use of the PPCD every day, at least 3 hours a day, till symptoms&#xD;
           are resolved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day14 (at the CRC; Clinical Research Center, University of Chicago): The following procedures&#xD;
      will be done in this order:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Initial blood drawing (20 ml), 18-24 hours after the 5th shot of Nuopogen. Blood samples&#xD;
           will be sent to Dr. T.C. He, PhD Lab for biochemical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients will then wear PPCD for 2 hours in seated position.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Just prior to the end of the 2-hour use of the PPCD, another blood draw will be done (20&#xD;
           ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. QOL will be filled by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patient will return the empty vials of Nuopogen.&#xD;
