      The purpose of this study is to learn if a chair-side testing device will accurately measure&#xD;
      levels of a salivary biomarker and thus indicate if a patient has periodontal health,&#xD;
      gingivitis or periodontal disease.&#xD;

      Human subjects will participate in this cross-sectional study by attending a single visit&#xD;
      where their mouth will be examined and saliva will be collected to help determine the&#xD;
      accuracy of a POC salivary diagnostic device. The study population will consist of 174&#xD;
      persons (58 that are orally healthy and have no oral discomfort; 58 that have gingivitis; and&#xD;
      58 that have periodontitis. The device results (i.e., visual and optical scans) will be&#xD;
      compared against the Luminex results by two methods: 1) the Bland-Altman procedure and 2)&#xD;
      discriminant analysis that examines whether the concentration would correctly identify the&#xD;
      subject as health or disease using a defined threshold for MMP-8 levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three groups of individuals will be recruited: those that are orally healthy and do not have&#xD;
      any oral discomfort (N=58), those who have gingivitis (i.e., bleeding gums; N=58), and those&#xD;
      who have periodontal disease (N=58). The groups will be matched by gender and smoking status.&#xD;
      Women are predicted to account for 50% of the participants. The age distribution will be 18&#xD;
      to 95 years. Subjects will not be excluded based on race, gender, or ethnicity.&#xD;

      5ml of saliva will be collected. A small sample of the saliva will be used chair side to&#xD;
      analyze on the device. The remaining saliva will be aliquoted into five samples and kept&#xD;
