  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease is an immunologically mediated inflammatory bowel disease with a reported&#xD;
      incidence of 4.0-7.0, 7.1, and 1.34 per 100,000 persons in Europe, the U.S., and Korea,&#xD;
      respectively. Uncontrolled chronic inflammation finally causes various complications in&#xD;
      intestine such as bowel obstruction, fistulas, abscesses, and anal fissures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of perianal fistula was reported in 13%- 39% of patients with Crohn's disease.&#xD;
      Medical treatment for Crohn's fistulae initially focused on surgical intervention accompanied&#xD;
      by symptomatic treatment with antibiotics and immunosuppressants. The most serious problem&#xD;
      after surgical intervention is the relatively high incidence of postoperative anal&#xD;
      incontinence caused by sphincter injury during the procedure. Conversely, available&#xD;
      pharmacological therapies for Crohn's fistulae based on biologic agents such as infliximab do&#xD;
      not generally reach ideal goal of treatment (e.g., complete closure of the fistula). A high&#xD;
      recurrence rate after treatment with infliximab has also been reported, even after long-term&#xD;
      maintenance therapy, which suggests that infliximab monotherapy does not provide adequate&#xD;
      healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ACCENT II study demonstraded a complete fistula healing in 25% of patients. To reach a&#xD;
      better clinical outcome, combination treatment with infliximab and surgical intervention is&#xD;
      highly recommended for management of Crohn's fistulae. Nonetheless, even this strategy does&#xD;
      not result in a satisfactory healing for many patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ideal therapeutic goal of treatment is not only complete closure of the fistula without&#xD;
      recurrence but also preservation of anal sphincter function. Unfortunately, currently&#xD;
      available medical or surgical treatment is not likely to offer a cure for perianal fistulae&#xD;
      and, as noted above, recurrence is frequently reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Together with active research in the field of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells&#xD;
      (BM-MSCs) and hematopoietic stem cells, autologous or allogenic adipose tissue-derived stem&#xD;
      cells (ASCs) have been studied for management of Crohn's disease and other disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of particular relevance to this study, ASCs could be considered to be safe and efficacious&#xD;
      therapeutic tools for the treatment of Crohn's fistulae. Importantly, ASCs do not cause fecal&#xD;
      incontinence after injection into the lesion site in Crohn's disease patients. A phase I&#xD;
      dose-escalation clinical study with ASCs manufactured by Anterogen Co., Ltd. (Seoul, Korea)&#xD;
      demonstrated the safety and therapeutic potential of these cells for the treatment of Crohn's&#xD;
      fistulae. A phase II study demonstrated a good rate of cronh's related fistula closure using&#xD;
      a ASCS injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actually the best accepted treatment of Crohn related perianal fistula, is the surgical&#xD;
      procedure in association whit medical therapy.&#xD;

      Basic information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lipogems: Lipogems® system is a disposable device for liposuction, processing and adipose&#xD;
      tissue reinjection. Procedure takes place in a single surgical time. It's a disposable device&#xD;
      that progressively reduces adipose tissue clusters size, washing completely pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      oil and blood debrides through a minimal manipulation &quot;free enzyme&quot; in a aseptic closed&#xD;
      system completely preﬁlled by room temperature physiological solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lipogems product is a non-expanded and microfractured fat tissue ready for autologous&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SalveColl-E: Salvecoll® is sterile bioplastic, equine derived, type I collagen material with&#xD;
      a fully preserved fibrous structure (non-reconstructed) that ensures the regeneration of&#xD;
      affected tissues. Type I collagen has zero risk of transmitting viral or microbial&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for the trial: To evaluate the efficacy of the use of ACSS in crohn related&#xD;
      perianal fistulas. The aim of the study is to improve fistula healing at 1 year from 25% to&#xD;
      65%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of subjects At the time of fistula diagnosis the patients will be screened for&#xD;
      eligibility and a informed consent will be administered . All patients will be underwent a&#xD;
      loose seton placement after antibiotics prophylaxis administration with Ciprofloxacin and&#xD;
      Metronidazole to obtain a pelvis sepsis resolution at time 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At week 4 a surgical procedure will be performed. In general anesthesia a antibiotics&#xD;
      prophylaxis will be administrated and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue will be collected&#xD;
      by LIPOGEMS system to prepare ASCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the infiltration step, adrenalin in a saline solution (2 μg/ml final concentration) is&#xD;
      infiltrated using a 19-cm specially designed disposable blunt cannula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vasoconstriction together with the blunt point of the cannula avoids any accidental&#xD;
      intravascular injection and facilitates the subsequent lipoaspiration. Three hundred to 500&#xD;
      ml are usually injected in the chosen area for fat harvesting (usually the lower abdomen),&#xD;
      making the tissue really &quot;filled&quot; with the injecting solution. The aspiration step&#xD;
      (lipoaspirate) is performed by a luer lock syringe connected to a disposable 19-cm blunt&#xD;
      cannula (3 mm OD), with 5 oval holes (1 ´ 2 mm). A few strokes using a standard liposuction&#xD;
      technique are enough to harvest 6-10 ml of fat tissue. Vacuum while aspirating can be&#xD;
      obtained manually or by clamping the syringe plunger with a clamp instrument. Up to 1,000 ml&#xD;
      can be harvested in less than 15 min, and 1-2 min are enough. The harvested lipoaspirate can&#xD;
      be progressively put into the device using multiple 10-cc syringes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, in lithotomy position, a seton will be removed and a fistula tract will be&#xD;
      thoroughly curetted and irrigated. After a mucosal flap preparing round the internal opening,&#xD;
      cells will be injected in the perianal adipose tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 40 and 130 ml of lipoaspirate (ideally 100 ml) are processed at each time in the&#xD;
      standard 225-ml device. To avoid cell damage, no air should be in the device during all&#xD;
      procedural steps and the device should be prefilled with saline before beginning the&#xD;
      processing. The aspirated fat should be always surrounded by a liquid environment: this is&#xD;
      essential to obtain healthy smaller fat clusters instead of oil and adipose tissue debris.&#xD;
      The first cluster reduction was obtained by pushing the aspirated fat from the syringe into&#xD;
      the device and through the first size reduction filter while allowing the corresponding&#xD;
      quantity of saline to exit towards the waste bag. The final Lipogems product is then&#xD;
      collected into 10-ml syringes connected to the upper opening of the device. The final&#xD;
      Lipogems product is now ready for the injection in the perianal fistula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a SALVECOLL-E paste injection into the fistula tract the mucosal flap will may be&#xD;
      closed with an absorbable interrupted sutures. A external opening will be sealed with&#xD;
      Dermabond Mini.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will receive a intravenous infusion of Infliximab (Remicade) at a dose of 5 mg&#xD;
      per kilogram of body weight at weeks 8, 10, 14 and every 8 week for a total of nine doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for treatment The ASCS injection in the perianal adipose tissue in association with&#xD;
      Infliximab therapy, would improve a crohn related perianal fistula healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This association could be reduce a recurrence and reintervention rate with an improvement of&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial population Number of subjects to be studied Planned number of subjects to be screened:&#xD;
      10 Anticipated number of trial sites: 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal criteria The subject may withdraw at will at any time. The patient may be&#xD;
      withdrawn from the trial at the discretion of the investigator for safety concerns. If the&#xD;
      patient withdraws or is withdrawn at any time after receiving trial product, final safety&#xD;
      information will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are deemed during surgery not suitable included in this protocol will be&#xD;
      withdrawn from the study. In case a subject is being prematurely withdrawn from the trial the&#xD;
      Investigator will ensure that the procedures for the last visit are undertaken, if possible.&#xD;
      The primary reason (adverse event, non-compliance with protocol or other) for discontinuation&#xD;
      must be specified in the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A patient withdrawn from the study will be analyzed according to evaluability of Subjects for&#xD;
      Analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and assessments Visit procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study comprises of the following visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1: Diagnosis, baseline visit and first surgery procedure: Screening of patient,&#xD;
           Baseline examination, Pre-surgery and surgery assessment, Informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 2: Treatment visit: Surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 3: Medical treatment: start Infliximab administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 4, 5, 6, 7,8,9: Medical treatment follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 10: end of study: last infliximab dose&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of any premature discontinuation of the trial, the patient will, if possible, be&#xD;
      called in for a last visit. Even if the patient is not able to attend, the End of Trial Form&#xD;
      must be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigator must keep a subject screening log and a subject enrolment log. These can be&#xD;
      combined in one document.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects enrolled in the trial will be provided with a documents stating that he/she is in a&#xD;
      trial, contact address and telephone numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case a subject is being prematurely withdrawn from the trial the Investigator will ensure&#xD;
      that the procedures for the last visit are undertaken, if possible. The primary reason&#xD;
      (adverse event, non-compliance with protocol or other) for discontinuation must be specified&#xD;
      in the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be classified according to the American Society of Anesthesiology Physical&#xD;
      Status Classification as described below. No restriction regarding to ASA status will be&#xD;
      applied in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Compliance The investigator will reinforce compliance with the protocol by ensuring&#xD;
      that only patients willing to follow the trial procedures are enrolled in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse event (AE):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a&#xD;
      pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with&#xD;
      this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An adverse event can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (e.g., including an&#xD;
      abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a&#xD;
      medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: This includes events from the first trial related activity after the subject has signed&#xD;
      the informed consent and until post treatment follow-up period as defined in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following should not be recorded as AEs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-planned procedures unless the condition for which the procedure was planned has&#xD;
           worsened from the first trial related activity after the subject has signed the informed&#xD;
           consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-existing conditions found as a result of screening procedures. These should be&#xD;
           recorded as medical history/concomitant illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An AE can also be a clinical laboratory abnormality regarded as clinically significant i.e.&#xD;
      an abnormality that suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity and is of a severity which&#xD;
      requires active management (i.e. discontinuation of trial product, more frequent follow-up or&#xD;
      diagnostic investigation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following events will not be recorded as adverse events, as such discomforts are expected&#xD;
      to be related to the surgical procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post operative nausea/vomit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post operative sore throat due to intubation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post operative pain due to surgical intervention within 3 months from the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious adverse event (SAE):&#xD;
&#xD;
      A SAE is an experience that at any dose results in any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Death&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A life-threatening* experience&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In-subject hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A persistent or significant disability/incapacity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening*, or require&#xD;
           hospitalization may be considered a SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment,&#xD;
           they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to&#xD;
           prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The term &quot;life-threatening&quot; in the definition of SAE refers to an event in which&#xD;
                the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an&#xD;
                event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-serious adverse event:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A non-serious AE is any AE which does not fulfil the definition of a serious AE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severity assessment definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mild - No or transient symptoms, no interference with the subject's daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Moderate - Marked symptoms, moderate interference with the subject's daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe - Considerable interference with the subject's daily activities, unacceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relationship to trial product assessment definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Probable: good reasons and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Possible: a causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unlikely: the event is most likely related to an aetiology other than the trial product&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome categories and definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recovered - Fully recovered, or by medical or surgical treatment the condition has&#xD;
           returned to the level observed at the first trial related activity after the subject&#xD;
           signed the informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recovering - The condition is improving and the subject is expected to recover from the&#xD;
           event. This term should only be used when the subject has completed the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recovered with sequelae - As a result of the AE the subject suffered persistent and&#xD;
           significant disability/incapacity (e.g. became blind, deaf, paralyzed). Any AE recovered&#xD;
           with sequelae should be rated as an SAE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Not recovered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fatal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unknown - This term should only be used in cases where the subject i&#xD;
