    <textblock>
      Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is an acquired psychiatric condition that occurs after&#xD;
      exposure to a dangerous or life-threatening event. It is characterized by persistent fear-&#xD;
      and stress-related symptoms, such as nightmares, flashbacks, depression, anxiety and guilt.&#xD;
      These symptoms can interfere significantly with patients' lives and in some cases can be&#xD;
      debilitating. One of the most frequent causes of PTSD is being a victim of a violent,&#xD;
      interpersonal assault.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTSD is felt to be primarily a disorder of memory formation - stressful memories are encoded&#xD;
      too strongly in a patient's long-term memory, remaining too accessible and &quot;present&quot; to the&#xD;
      patient long after the actual threat has passed. In recent years evidence has emerged that it&#xD;
      may be possible to prevent PTSD by moderating the process of memory consolidation that occurs&#xD;
      in the hours and days after a traumatic event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early research has suggested that enhancing the body's natural cortisol response to a&#xD;
      stressful event may be a safe and effective way of moderating the process of memory&#xD;
      consolidation and promoting adaptive, non-pathological memory encoding. In particular, the&#xD;
      administration of hydrocortisone, a safe and widely used drug that mimics the body's own&#xD;
      cortisol hormone, appears to reduce the risk of developing PTSD in patients who have&#xD;
      sustained a traumatic event. However, this research is still in relatively early stages, and&#xD;
      requires larger trials to confirm its efficacy. In addition, the research thus far has not&#xD;
      adequately targeted assault victims, whom Investigator feel are some of the patients most&#xD;
      likely to benefit from such an approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators propose a prospective, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial of&#xD;
      administering single-dose oral hydrocortisone or placebo to 100 assault victims seen in the&#xD;
      Einstein Medical Center Philadelphia Emergency Department to determine if this approach has&#xD;
      efficacy in preventing PTSD. This study is designed as a pilot study, with the hopes that the&#xD;
      data gathered in it can be used to design a larger and more robust trial in the future.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adult subjects will be screened in the Emergency Department (ED) by research associates. If&#xD;
      they meet inclusion/exclusion criteria they will be offered enrollment. Subjects who choose&#xD;
      to enroll will be randomized to receive either hydrocortisone 120mg PO, or placebo PO, one&#xD;
      time in the Emergency Department. They will be given a packet of general information on&#xD;
      traumatic stress and contact information for psychiatric assistance if they require it, but&#xD;
      no further PTSD treatment will be given. Any further medical treatment will be at the&#xD;
      discretion of the treating team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 6 weeks after enrollment subjects will be contacted by phone, and a brief structured&#xD;
      interview, based on the PCL-S (a well-validated screening instrument for PTSD), will be&#xD;
      administered by phone. Participants who screen positive will be informed that they may be&#xD;
      suffering from PTSD, and will be offered the opportunity to seek care with the Einstein&#xD;
      Psychiatry Department's PTSD program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 6 months after enrollment subjects will again be contacted and administered the PCL-C, as&#xD;
      well as questions regarding other psychiatric comorbidities, substance use, and involvement&#xD;
      in any further episodes of violence. In addition, review of subject medical records over the&#xD;
      year since injury will be undertaken to determine if there is any difference in subsequent&#xD;
      health-care utilization between those who received hydrocortisone vs placebo and between&#xD;
      those who screen positive for PTSD vs those who don't.&#xD;
