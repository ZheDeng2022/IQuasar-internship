      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number one cause of mortality for men and women in the&#xD;
      United States. Dyslipidemia, particularly a high low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)&#xD;
      level, is a well-established cardiovascular risk factor and the current American Heart&#xD;
      Association guideline for CVD risk assessment recommends a lipid panel to be checked. In&#xD;
      addition, guidelines recommend statin therapy in all patients with clinical atherosclerotic&#xD;
      CVD, all patients with LDL-C = 190 mg/dL, patients age 40-75 years with diabetes and LDL-C&#xD;
      70-189 mg/dL, and patients with an estimated 10-year atherosclerotic CVD risk = 7.5%. For all&#xD;
      of these patients, a fasting lipid panel should be drawn prior to statin initiation as well&#xD;
      as during follow-up to assess medication and lifestyle adherence. These fasting lipid panels&#xD;
      are obtained via conventional phlebotomy via venopuncture in an office-based or hospital&#xD;
      laboratory setting. However, research protein quantitation with mass spectrometry and&#xD;
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are technologies that allow for sensitive&#xD;
      quantitation of protein biomarkers and targets, including lipoproteins. Most importantly,&#xD;
      multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mass spectrometry is able to assess samples from a dried&#xD;
      blood spot (DBS), whose advantages include minimal volume requirements, ease of sample&#xD;
      attainment by finger stick with minimal training required, ease of transport, and sample&#xD;
      stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the proposed analysis is to 1) measure changes in CVD biomarkers before and&#xD;
      after initiation of statin therapy and 2) compare lipid measurements by conventional&#xD;
      phlebotomy blood samples to research protein quantitation measurements in DBS and plasma.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Despite reductions in cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in the past 20 years, CVD&#xD;
      remains the leading cause of mortality in the United States, accounting for ~1 of every 3&#xD;
      deaths. CVD costs the U.S. over $100 billion annually and is an important field for targeted&#xD;
      primary and secondary prevention. Dyslipidemia, particularly a high low-density-lipoprotein&#xD;
      cholesterol (LDL-C) level, is a well-established cardiovascular risk factor, and fasting&#xD;
      lipid panels (including total cholesterol, LDL-C, triglycerides, and high-density-lipoprotein&#xD;
      cholesterol [HDL-C]) are included in the recent 2013 ACC/AHA Risk Assessment Guidelines.&#xD;
      Clinical trials have shown that low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction with&#xD;
      statin therapy predicts cardiovascular event reduction. About a quarter of all adults &gt;45&#xD;
      years old were on statin therapy in 2008, and this will likely increase due to the recent&#xD;
      2013 ACC/AHA Cholesterol Management guidelines. These guidelines recommend statin therapy in&#xD;
      all patients with clinical atherosclerotic CVD, all patients with LDL-C = 190 mg/dL, patients&#xD;
      age 40-75 years with diabetes and LDL-C 70-189 mg/dL, and patients with an estimated 10-year&#xD;
      atherosclerotic CVD risk = 7.5%. For all of these patients, a fasting lipid panel should be&#xD;
      drawn prior to statin initiation as well as during follow-up to assess medication and&#xD;
      lifestyle adherence. These fasting lipid panels are obtained via conventional phlebotomy via&#xD;
      venopuncture in an office-based or hospital laboratory setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research protein quantitation with mass spectrometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay&#xD;
      (ELISA) are technologies that allow for sensitive quantitation of protein biomarkers and&#xD;
      targets, including lipoproteins. Most importantly, multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mass&#xD;
      spectrometry is able to assess samples from a dried blood spot (DBS), whose advantages&#xD;
      include minimal volume requirements, ease of sample attainment by finger stick with minimal&#xD;
      training required, ease of transport, and sample stability. DBS sampling has been used for&#xD;
      clinical and pre-clinical studies, simplifying sample collection and handling. However,&#xD;
      research protein quantitation with mass spectrometry and ELISA has not been compared against&#xD;
      conventional blood sample for evaluating changes in cholesterol levels during statin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While LDL-C is well-established in predicting CVD event reduction, other laboratory lipid,&#xD;
      thrombotic and inflammatory biomarkers have been shown to be associated with atherosclerotic&#xD;
      plaque development or CVD risk. These include Apo A-I, Apo B, Apo E, IgM, plasminogen,&#xD;
      TIMP-1, Von Willebrand factor, antithrombin III, cystatin C, mesothelin, C-reactive protein,&#xD;
      SAA, LPS-binding protein, mannose-binding lectin, myeloperoxidase, fibrinogen, alpha-1-acid&#xD;
      glycoprotein, soluble transferrin receptor, haptoglobin. All of these CVD protein biomarkers&#xD;
      can be measured by research protein quantitation techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a pilot study of 20 subjects, we aim to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. measure changes in a panel of CVD protein biomarkers before and after initiation of&#xD;
           statin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. compare clinical laboratory measurements of LDL-C and HDL-C in conventional phlebotomy&#xD;
           blood samples with research protein quantitation mass spectrometry and ELISA&#xD;
           measurements of LDL-C (Apo B) and HDL-C (Apo A-I) proteins in DBS and plasma.&#xD;
