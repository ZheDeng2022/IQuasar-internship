      The HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) is doing a study to test a new HIV vaccine combination.&#xD;
      HIV is the virus that causes AIDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      252 people are taking part in this study at multiple sites. The US National Institutes of&#xD;
      Health (NIH) is paying for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are doing this study to answer several questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are the study vaccines safe to give to people?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are people able to take the study vaccines without becoming too uncomfortable?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How do people's immune systems respond to the study vaccines? (Your immune system&#xD;
           protects you from disease.)&#xD;

      The HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) is doing a study to test a new HIV vaccine combination.&#xD;
      HIV is the virus that causes AIDS. The investigators are doing this study to answer several&#xD;
      questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are the study vaccines safe to give to people?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are people able to take the study vaccines without becoming too uncomfortable?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How do people's immune systems respond to the study vaccines? (Your immune system&#xD;
           protects you from disease.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study uses 2 different vaccines: ALVAC-HIV (vCP2438) and bivalent gp120/MF59. These are&#xD;
      experimental HIV vaccines -- the investigators do not know whether the vaccines will be safe&#xD;
      to use in people, or whether they will work to prevent HIV infection. These vaccines are used&#xD;
      only in research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ALVAC vaccine is made out of canarypox virus, which infects birds but cannot grow in&#xD;
      human cells. This virus has small bits of man-made DNA inserted into it. DNA is a natural&#xD;
      substance found in all living things, including people and some viruses. The canarypox virus&#xD;
      helps get the DNA into the body's cells. The DNA then tells those cells to make small amounts&#xD;
      of proteins that look like some of the ones found in HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study in South Africa, HVTN 097, gave a similar ALVAC vaccine to about 80 participants. So&#xD;
      far, no one has had serious health problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Protein vaccine has man-made pieces of a protein found on the outside of HIV. These&#xD;
      protein pieces are mixed with an adjuvant called MF59. An adjuvant is something added to the&#xD;
      vaccine to help the immune system respond better. MF59 has been included with other vaccines&#xD;
      that have been given to over 50,000 people in clinical trials without causing any serious&#xD;
      health problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This combination of study vaccines has not been given to people before. However, similar&#xD;
      ALVAC and protein vaccines have been given to more than 10,000 people in clinical trials&#xD;
      without causing any serious health problems. Also, over 300 people have received a similar&#xD;
      combination of ALVAC and protein vaccines with the MF59 adjuvant in clinical trials without&#xD;
      having any serious health problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is in 2 parts, Part A and Part B. Part B continues the study in order to learn how&#xD;
      well boosting the study vaccines improves immune responses. 252 people took part in Part A of&#xD;
      this study at multiple sites. Those who continue to meet eligibility requirements are invited&#xD;
      to continue in Part B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) is paying for the study. For people who continue&#xD;
      to Part B, the study requires about 23 clinic visits in 4 years.&#xD;

    <measure>Part A: Occurrence of IgG Ab Binding to gp120 Env Proteins Contained in the Vaccine (ZM96, TV1.C, 1086.C) After the Primary Vaccine Regimen, Measured by HIV-1 Multiplex Antibody Assay</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at Month 6.5</time_frame>
    <description>Serum HIV-1-specific IgG responses were measured on a Bio-Plex instrument using a standardized custom Luminex assay. The readout is background-subtracted mean fluorescent intensity (MFI), with background adjustment for an antigen-specific plate level control. For each sample, response magnitude is net MFI, defined as experimental antigen MFI minus reference antigen MFI. Net MFI less than 1 is set to 1. Samples from post-enrollment visits have positive responses if they meet three conditions: (1) net MFI greater than or equal to an antigen-specific response threshold (defined as the maximum of 100 and the 95th percentile of pre-vaccination net MFI), (2) net MFI values are greater than 3 times pre-vaccination net MFI, and (3) experimental antigen MFI values are greater than 3 times pre-vaccination MFI. Data are excluded if the blood draw date was outside the allowable window, a participant was HIV-infected, or the reference antigen exceeds 5000 MFI.</description>

    <description>PBMC samples are stimulated with synthetic peptide pools or left unstimulated as a negative control. For each sample, T-cell subset, and peptide pool, response magnitude is % cells expressing markers after peptide stimulation minus % cells expressing markers after no stimulation. A contingency table is constructed to assess response: stimulation (peptide/none) vs. marker expression (yes/no). A one-sided Fisher's exact test is applied, testing if the number of cells positive for the marker is equal in the stimulated vs. unstimulated cells. A discrete Bonferroni adjustment is made over the peptide pools. Response is positive if p&lt;=0.00001. Data are excluded if the blood draw date was outside the visit window, the participant was HIV-infected, PBMC viability or T-cell count were low, or negative control was high.</description>

For each sample, T-cell subset, and peptide pool, response magnitude is % cells expressing markers after peptide stimulation minus % cells expressing markers after no stimulation. A contingency table is constructed to assess response: stimulation (peptide/none) vs. marker expression (yes/no). A one-sided Fisher's exact test is applied, testing if the number of cells positive for the marker is equal in the stimulated vs. unstimulated cells. A discrete Bonferroni adjustment is made over the peptide pools. Response is positive if p&lt;=0.00001. Data are excluded if the blood draw date was outside the visit window, the participant was HIV-infected, PBMC viability or T-cell count were low, or negative control was high. Comparisons were performed among positive responders only.</description>

    <description>Serum HIV-1-specific IgG responses were measured on a Bio-Plex instrument using a standardized custom Luminex assay. The readout is background-subtracted mean fluorescent intensity (MFI), with background adjustment for an antigen-specific plate level control. For each sample, response magnitude is net MFI, defined as experimental antigen MFI minus reference antigen MFI. Net MFI less than 1 is set to 1. Samples from post-enrollment visits have positive responses if they meet three conditions: (1) net MFI greater than or equal to an antigen-specific response threshold (defined as the maximum of 100 and the 95th percentile of pre-vaccination net MFI), (2) net MFI values are greater than 3 times pre-vaccination net MFI, and (3) experimental antigen MFI values are greater than 3 times pre-vaccination MFI. Data are excluded if the blood draw date was outside the allowable window, a participant was HIV-infected, or the reference antigen exceeds 5000 MFI.</description>

        <title>Part A: Occurrence of IgG Ab Binding to gp120 Env Proteins Contained in the Vaccine (ZM96, TV1.C, 1086.C) After the Primary Vaccine Regimen, Measured by HIV-1 Multiplex Antibody Assay</title>
        <description>Serum HIV-1-specific IgG responses were measured on a Bio-Plex instrument using a standardized custom Luminex assay. The readout is background-subtracted mean fluorescent intensity (MFI), with background adjustment for an antigen-specific plate level control. For each sample, response magnitude is net MFI, defined as experimental antigen MFI minus reference antigen MFI. Net MFI less than 1 is set to 1. Samples from post-enrollment visits have positive responses if they meet three conditions: (1) net MFI greater than or equal to an antigen-specific response threshold (defined as the maximum of 100 and the 95th percentile of pre-vaccination net MFI), (2) net MFI values are greater than 3 times pre-vaccination net MFI, and (3) experimental antigen MFI values are greater than 3 times pre-vaccination MFI. Data are excluded if the blood draw date was outside the allowable window, a participant was HIV-infected, or the reference antigen exceeds 5000 MFI.</description>

        <title>Part A: Level of IgG Binding Antibodies to 3 V1V2-scaffolded Env Proteins After the Primary Vaccine Regimen</title>
        <description>Serum HIV-1-specific IgG responses were measured on a Bio-Plex instrument using a standardized custom Luminex assay. The readout is background-subtracted mean fluorescent intensity (MFI), with background adjustment for an antigen-specific plate level control. For each sample, response magnitude is net MFI, defined as experimental antigen MFI minus reference antigen MFI. Net MFI less than 1 is set to 1. The measure unit fluorescence units are relative to assay background, not relative to the placebo arm. Background is used here rather than negative control stimulation, since the antigens are used as bead coating rather than stimulation.</description>

        <title>Part A: Occurrence of CD4+ T Cell Responses to the HIV Proteins Included in the Vaccine After the Primary Vaccine Regimen. Measured by Flow Cytometry.</title>
        <description>PBMC samples are stimulated with synthetic peptide pools or left unstimulated as a negative control. For each sample, T-cell subset, and peptide pool, response magnitude is % cells expressing markers after peptide stimulation minus % cells expressing markers after no stimulation. A contingency table is constructed to assess response: stimulation (peptide/none) vs. marker expression (yes/no). A one-sided Fisher's exact test is applied, testing if the number of cells positive for the marker is equal in the stimulated vs. unstimulated cells. A discrete Bonferroni adjustment is made over the peptide pools. Response is positive if p&lt;=0.00001. Data are excluded if the blood draw date was outside the visit window, the participant was HIV-infected, PBMC viability or T-cell count were low, or negative control was high.</description>

        <description>Serum HIV-1-specific IgG responses were measured on a Bio-Plex instrument using a standardized custom Luminex assay. The readout is background-subtracted mean fluorescent intensity (MFI), with background adjustment for an antigen-specific plate level control. For each sample, response magnitude is net MFI, defined as experimental antigen MFI minus reference antigen MFI. Net MFI less than 1 is set to 1. The measure unit fluorescence units are relative to assay background, not relative to the placebo arm. Background is used here rather than negative control stimulation, since the antigens are used as bead coating rather than stimulation.</description>

        <title>Part B: Level of IgG Ab Binding to gp120 Env Proteins Contained in the Vaccine (ZM96, TV1.C, 1086.C) in the Extension Study</title>
        <description>Serum HIV-1-specific IgG responses were measured on a Bio-Plex instrument using a standardized custom Luminex assay. The readout is background-subtracted mean fluorescent intensity (MFI), with background adjustment for an antigen-specific plate level control. For each sample, response magnitude is net MFI, defined as experimental antigen MFI minus reference antigen MFI. Net MFI less than 1 is set to 1. The measure unit fluorescence units are relative to assay background, not relative to the placebo arm. Background is used here rather than negative control stimulation, since the antigens are used as bead coating rather than stimulation.</description>

        <title>Part A: Compare the Occurrence of IgG Ab Binding to gp120 Env Proteins Contained in the Vaccine (ZM96, TV1.C, 1086.C) After the Fourth Versus the Fifth Vaccination</title>
        <description>Serum HIV-1-specific IgG responses were measured on a Bio-Plex instrument using a standardized custom Luminex assay. The readout is background-subtracted mean fluorescent intensity (MFI), with background adjustment for an antigen-specific plate level control. For each sample, response magnitude is net MFI, defined as experimental antigen MFI minus reference antigen MFI. Net MFI less than 1 is set to 1. Samples from post-enrollment visits have positive responses if they meet three conditions: (1) net MFI greater than or equal to an antigen-specific response threshold (defined as the maximum of 100 and the 95th percentile of pre-vaccination net MFI), (2) net MFI values are greater than 3 times pre-vaccination net MFI, and (3) experimental antigen MFI values are greater than 3 times pre-vaccination MFI. Data are excluded if the blood draw date was outside the allowable window, a participant was HIV-infected, or the reference antigen exceeds 5000 MFI.</description>

        <title>Part A: Compare the Level of IgG Ab Binding to gp120 Env Proteins Contained in the Vaccine (ZM96, TV1.C, 1086.C) After the Fourth Versus the Fifth Vaccination</title>
        <description>Serum HIV-1-specific IgG responses were measured on a Bio-Plex instrument using a standardized custom Luminex assay. The readout is background-subtracted mean fluorescent intensity (MFI), with background adjustment for an antigen-specific plate level control. For each sample, response magnitude is net MFI, defined as experimental antigen MFI minus reference antigen MFI. Net MFI less than 1 is set to 1. The measure unit fluorescence units are relative to assay background, not relative to the placebo arm. Background is used here rather than negative control stimulation, since the antigens are used as bead coating rather than stimulation. Comparisons were performed among positive responders only (positivity criteria is described in Outcome 30).</description>

        <population>The durability cohort was randomly selected from those in the month 6.5 cohort with samples collected at month 12.5.

For each sample, response magnitude is net MFI, defined as experimental antigen MFI minus reference antigen MFI. Net MFI less than 1 is set to 1. Samples from post-enrollment visits have positive responses if they meet three conditions: (1) net MFI greater than or equal to an antigen-specific response threshold (defined as the maximum of 100 and the 95th percentile of pre-vaccination net MFI), (2) net MFI values are greater than 3 times pre-vaccination net MFI, and (3) experimental antigen MFI values are greater than 3 times pre-vaccination MFI. Data are excluded if the blood draw date was outside the allowable window, a participant was HIV-infected, or the reference antigen exceeds 5000 MFI.</description>

        <title>Part A: Compare the Level of IgG Binding Antibodies to 3 V1V2-scaffolded Env Proteins After the Fourth Versus the Fifth Vaccination</title>
        <description>Serum HIV-1-specific IgG responses were measured on a Bio-Plex instrument using a standardized custom Luminex assay. The readout is background-subtracted mean fluorescent intensity (MFI), with background adjustment for an antigen-specific plate level control. For each sample, response magnitude is net MFI, defined as experimental antigen MFI minus reference antigen MFI. Net MFI less than 1 is set to 1. The measure unit fluorescence units are relative to assay background, not relative to the placebo arm. Background is used here rather than negative control stimulation, since the antigens are used as bead coating rather than stimulation. Comparisons were performed among positive responders only (positivity criteria is described in Outcome 32).</description>

        <population>The durability cohort was randomly selected from those in the month 6.5 cohort with samples collected at month 12.5. Selection was stratified by gender to match the overall protocol. &quot;Overall Number of Participants Analyzed&quot; represents the durability cohort. &quot;Number Analyzed&quot; counts participants with data meeting assay-specific quality criteria.</population>

        <description>PBMC samples are stimulated with synthetic peptide pools or left unstimulated as a negative control. For each sample, T-cell subset, and peptide pool, response magnitude is % cells expressing markers after peptide stimulation minus % cells expressing markers after no stimulation. A contingency table is constructed to assess response: stimulation (peptide/none) vs. marker expression (yes/no). A one-sided Fisher's exact test is applied, testing if the number of cells positive for the marker is equal in the stimulated vs. unstimulated cells. A discrete Bonferroni adjustment is made over the peptide pools. Response is positive if p&lt;=0.00001. Data are excluded if the blood draw date was outside the visit window, the participant was HIV-infected, PBMC viability or T-cell count were low, or negative control was high.</description>

The readout is background-subtracted mean fluorescent intensity (MFI), with background adjustment for an antigen-specific plate level control. For each sample, response magnitude is net MFI, defined as experimental antigen MFI minus reference antigen MFI. Net MFI less than 1 is set to 1. Samples from post-enrollment visits have positive responses if they meet three conditions: (1) net MFI greater than or equal to an antigen-specific response threshold (defined as the maximum of 100 and the 95th percentile of pre-vaccination net MFI), (2) net MFI values are greater than 3 times pre-vaccination net MFI, and (3) experimental antigen MFI values are greater than 3 times pre-vaccination MFI. Data are excluded if the blood draw date was outside the allowable window, a participant was HIV-infected, or the reference antigen exceeds 5000 MFI.</description>

        <description>Serum HIV-1-specific IgG responses were measured on a Bio-Plex instrument using a standardized custom Luminex assay. The readout is background-subtracted mean fluorescent intensity (MFI), with background adjustment for an antigen-specific plate level control. For each sample, response magnitude is net MFI, defined as experimental antigen MFI minus reference antigen MFI. Net MFI less than 1 is set to 1. The measure unit fluorescence units are relative to assay background, not relative to the placebo arm. Background is used here rather than negative control stimulation, since the antigens are used as bead coating rather than stimulation.</description>

        <title>Part B: Occurrence of IgG Binding Antibodies to 3 V1V2-scaffolded Env Proteins in the Extension Study, at 6 Months After the Month 30 Vaccination</title>
        <description>Serum HIV-1-specific IgG responses were measured on a Bio-Plex instrument using a standardized custom Luminex assay. The readout is background-subtracted mean fluorescent intensity (MFI), with background adjustment for an antigen-specific plate level control. For each sample, response magnitude is net MFI, defined as experimental antigen MFI minus reference antigen MFI. Net MFI less than 1 is set to 1. Samples from post-enrollment visits have positive responses if they meet three conditions: (1) net MFI greater than or equal to an antigen-specific response threshold (defined as the maximum of 100 and the 95th percentile of pre-vaccination net MFI), (2) net MFI values are greater than 3 times pre-vaccination net MFI, and (3) experimental antigen MFI values are greater than 3 times pre-vaccination MFI. Data are excluded if the blood draw date was outside the allowable window, a participant was HIV-infected, or the reference antigen exceeds 5000 MFI.</description>

        <description>Serum HIV-1-specific IgG responses were measured on a Bio-Plex instrument using a standardized custom Luminex assay. The readout is background-subtracted mean fluorescent intensity (MFI), with background adjustment for an antigen-specific plate level control. For each sample, response magnitude is net MFI, defined as experimental antigen MFI minus reference antigen MFI. Net MFI less than 1 is set to 1. The measure unit fluorescence units are relative to assay background, not relative to the placebo arm. Background is used here rather than negative control stimulation, since the antigens are used as bead coating rather than stimulation.</description>

For each sample, response magnitude is net MFI, defined as experimental antigen MFI minus reference antigen MFI. Net MFI less than 1 is set to 1. The measure unit fluorescence units are relative to assay background, not relative to the placebo arm. Background is used here rather than negative control stimulation, since the antigens are used as bead coating rather than stimulation.</description>

        <title>Part B: Occurrence of CD4+ T Cell Responses to the HIV Proteins Included in the Vaccine in the Extension Study, at 6 Months After the Month 30 Vaccination</title>
        <description>PBMC samples are stimulated with synthetic peptide pools or left unstimulated as a negative control. For each sample, T-cell subset, and peptide pool, response magnitude is % cells expressing markers after peptide stimulation minus % cells expressing markers after no stimulation. A contingency table is constructed to assess response: stimulation (peptide/none) vs. marker expression (yes/no). A one-sided Fisher's exact test is applied, testing if the number of cells positive for the marker is equal in the stimulated vs. unstimulated cells. A discrete Bonferroni adjustment is made over the peptide pools. Response is positive if p&lt;=0.00001. Data are excluded if the blood draw date was outside the visit window, the participant was HIV-infected, PBMC viability or T-cell count were low, or negative control was high.</description>

        <title>Part B: Level of CD4+ T Cell Responses to the HIV Proteins Included in the Vaccine in the Extension Study, at 6 Months After the Month 30 Vaccination</title>
        <description>PBMC samples are stimulated with synthetic peptide pools or left unstimulated as a negative control. For each sample, T-cell subset, and peptide pool, response magnitude is % cells expressing markers after peptide stimulation minus % cells expressing markers after no stimulation. A contingency table is constructed to assess response: stimulation (peptide/none) vs. marker expression (yes/no). A one-sided Fisher's exact test is applied, testing if the number of cells positive for the marker is equal in the stimulated vs. unstimulated cells. A discrete Bonferroni adjustment is made over the peptide pools. Response is positive if p&lt;=0.00001. Data are excluded if the blood draw date was outside the visit window, the participant was HIV-infected, PBMC viability or T-cell count were low, or negative control was high.</description>
