      Problem: Adolescent patellofemoral pain (PFP) is a major problem worldwide and affects 7% of&#xD;
      adolescents. Adolescents with PFP have long-lasting severe pain and low quality of life.&#xD;
      Current treatment is ineffective for more than 60% and new treatment approaches are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Solution: A novel multidimensional diagnostic approach combining imaging, physical activity&#xD;
      level and pain sensitisation in adolescents with PFP. This approach will enable the&#xD;
      identification of adolescents with PFP who benefits from a new treatment strategy using&#xD;
      activity modification to reduce loading of the patellofemoral joint and graded exercises to&#xD;
      improve loading capacity.&#xD;

      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adolescents will be recruited from a population-based cohort from Aalborg and Copenhagen&#xD;
      consisting of a total of 16 public schools. This cohort will allow for recruitment of&#xD;
      adolescents with PFP from the following categories 1) adolescents not participating in sport&#xD;
      outside school; 2) adolescents involved in sports a minimum of 3 times per week. In addition,&#xD;
      a randomly recruited age- and gender-matched pain-free group from the same cohort will be&#xD;
      recruited to form a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adolescents will be requested to complete an online questionnaire on current pain&#xD;
      problems. If they report having knee pain they will be telephoned. The telephone interview&#xD;
      will collect an anamnesis and the adolescents and their parents will be invited to a clinical&#xD;
      examination if they have anterior knee pain with an insidious onset and with duration of more&#xD;
      than 6 weeks. If the adolescents are diagnosed with PFP they are invited to participate in&#xD;
      the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PFP will be diagnosed using eligibility criteria in line with previous clinical trials and&#xD;
      commonly accepted criteria. All adolescents with PFP from the cohort will be examined using&#xD;
      self-report questionnaires, clinical examination, strength of the hip and knee, MRI and&#xD;
      pressure pain thresholds. Pressure pain thresholds will be measured around the knee, lower&#xD;
      leg and forearm to assess local and secondary mechanical hyperalgesia and thus the&#xD;
      sensitisation of the central nervous pain system. Additionally, cuff-algometry will be used&#xD;
      to asses temporal summation of pain during repeated stimuli and conditioned pain modulation.&#xD;
      The pain-free control group will be examined using the same measurements. The comparison&#xD;
      between adolescents with PFP and the pain-free control group will be used in 1-2 descriptive&#xD;
      studies with the main purpose of describing this young population based on self-report&#xD;
      questionnaires, MRI-scans, strength of the hip ad knee and pain mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adolescents with PFP will be asked to participate in main study which investigates the effect&#xD;
      of early activity modification and graded exercises among adolescents with patellofemoral&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a prospective cohort design the investigators will investigate the effect of a novel&#xD;
      treatment strategy aimed at temporary reduction in the loading of the patellofemoral joint by&#xD;
      activity modification. After inclusion, the custody holder and the adolescent with PFP will&#xD;
      be informed to begin a 4 week activity modification period and avoid all sports activity&#xD;
      including school sports. This protocol will cause a temporary reduction in the loading of the&#xD;
      patellofemoral joint. At 4 weeks they are instructed to begin a predefined training protocol&#xD;
      involving graded exercises. The purpose of the graded exercises is to increase loading&#xD;
      capacity of the tissue around the knee.&#xD;
