      Aim: to evaluate the additional effects of the 12 weeks usage of a Streptococcus containing&#xD;
      probiotic tablet after scaling and rootplaning compared to a placebo tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods: 48 periodontitis patients were included in this double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial. After scaling and rootplaning, they were given patients used either&#xD;
      a placebo (SRP) or probiotic tablet (SRP + P), 2 times a day for 12 weeks. Clinical and&#xD;
      microbiological parameters were studied recorded up to 24 weeks after scaling and&#xD;
      rootplaning.&#xD;

      Materials and methods This double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized (1:1 ratio)&#xD;
      controlled trial with two parallel arms involved 48 patients with advanced adult&#xD;
      periodontitis. They were recruited at the periodontology department of the Cukurova&#xD;
      university, Turkey. All patients referred for periodontal treatment were screened for&#xD;
      eligibility.The project was approved by the ethical committee for clinical trials of the&#xD;
      Cukurova University in Turkey with number . No changes in the trial design were made after&#xD;
      approval by the Ethical Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation and randomization Power analysis prior to the start of the study was&#xD;
      difficult since no previous randomized controlled trials on this study product were&#xD;
      available. The sample size was determined. Pocket probing depth was taken into account, with&#xD;
      an expected difference of 0.82mm and a standard deviation of 0.61mm. It was calculated that&#xD;
      10 patients were needed in each group to provide 80% power with an alpha of 0.05 . Despite&#xD;
      this low number and taking into consideration studies comparing the adjunctive effect of&#xD;
      antibiotics to scaling and rootplaning, it was decided to include 24 patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization of the patients was done by block randomization . The study coordinator&#xD;
      distributed the coded bottles to the examiner at baseline, 4 weeks and 8 weeks visit. Except&#xD;
      for the study coordinator, all patients and study personnel were blinded to the study group&#xD;
      allocation. Before sending the data to the biostatistician, the code was broken to group the&#xD;
      patients to the proper groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment protocol Patients fulfilling the eligibility criteria were asked to participate in&#xD;
      the study and after approval to sign an informed consent. Baseline examination included&#xD;
      full-mouth probing pocket depth , gingival recession and bleeding on probing measured at six&#xD;
      sites per tooth. Additionally the plaque en gingival indexes were noted. The full-mouth&#xD;
      plaque index was recorded.After baseline periodontal examination and microbial analysis, an&#xD;
      oral hygiene instruction was given (toothbrush, interdental brush). Initial periodontal&#xD;
      therapy consisted of a full-mouth one-stage disinfection approach . All clinical procedures&#xD;
      were performed by the same periodontist . The patient was asked to rinse for 2 minutes with a&#xD;
      0.12% chlorhexidine solution without alcohol . Scaling and rootplaning were performed on 2&#xD;
      consecutive days using an ultrasonic scaler under 0.12% chlorhexidine irrigation and with&#xD;
      hand instruments. All mucosal surfaces were afterwards disinfected and the tongue was brushed&#xD;
      for 1 minute. Besides, the participants were randomized over the 2 treatment groups: control&#xD;
      or probiotic group.The participants of the probiotic group were asked to let a probiotic&#xD;
      tablet dissolve on their tongue 2 times a day for 3 months. The participants in the control&#xD;
      group were asked to do the same with a placebo tablet. All patients were instructed to use&#xD;
      the tablets after brushing their teeth in the morning and in the evening. The probiotic and&#xD;
      placebo tablets were identical in shape, texture, taste and composition except that&#xD;
      Streptococcus were added for the probiotic tablet. All patients were supplied with the same&#xD;
      toothpaste . It was asked not to use any probiotic containing products during the course of&#xD;
      the study. Neither was it allowed to use drugs with anti-inflammatory properties,&#xD;
      chlorhexidine or other mouthrinses during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At designated time points, follow-up visits were planned. 30 days and 60 days after&#xD;
      initiation of the therapy clinical evaluation and microbial analysis were performed. 90 days&#xD;
      and 180 days after the initial treatment all baseline parameters were recorded .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes variables of interest Primary outcome measures The primary response variable was&#xD;
      Probing pocket depth. All examinations were performed with a North Carolina periodontal probe&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures The secondary response variables were recession, clinical&#xD;
      attachment level , Bleeding, Gingival index, Plaque index and microbial parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-analyses were performed on these outcome variables taking into account the initial&#xD;
      Pocket. A pocket was considered moderate if its initial Pocket was between 4 and 6 mm and&#xD;
      deep if ≥7 mm. &quot;Risk for disease progression&quot; was defined at patient level. The &quot;need for&#xD;
      surgery&quot; outcome measure was calculated. A site was considered as &quot;in need for surgery&quot; if&#xD;
      the Pocket was ≥6 mm or 5 mm and Bleeding positive. A tooth was considered in need for&#xD;
      surgery if it had at least one site in need for surgery. A patient was considered in need or&#xD;
      surgery if at least one tooth was in need for surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiological samples were collected of supragingival and subgingival plaque, saliva and&#xD;
      the tongue. Pooled supragingival plaque samples were taken with the aid of curettes at the&#xD;
      four single-rooted teeth with the deepest initial pocket in each quadrant. Before sampling,&#xD;
      the sites were isolated from saliva with the aid of cotton rolls and then dried with&#xD;
      compressed air. All supragingival plaque from these sites was dispersed. Samples were&#xD;
      dispersed using a vortex mixer and immediately frozen at -20°C until analysis. On the same&#xD;
      teeth pooled subgingival plaque samples were collected per site. After 10 s, the samples were&#xD;
      transferred to a sterile Eppendorf tube, as described Saliva samples were obtained by&#xD;
      collecting unstimulated saliva in a sterile cup. Finally the biofilm of the tongue was&#xD;
      collected with a cotton swab. These were wiped 10 times over the tongue starting from the&#xD;
      tongue dorsum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Processing of the microbial samples After finishing the study, the frozen samples were send&#xD;
      on dry ice to the department of Periodontology , these were immediately frozen at -80°C upon&#xD;
      arrival. each sample was later defrosted and centrifuged at 13.000g. Bacterial DNA was&#xD;
      extracted . A quantitative assay was performed to quantify certain bacteria.&#xD;
