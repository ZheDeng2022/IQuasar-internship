    <textblock>
      GADD34 is an inducible cofactor of protein phosphatase 1, which has an important role in the&#xD;
      Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). UPR is a cellular response to ER stress which is implicated&#xD;
      in several autoimmune diseases. GADD34 has been shown to be necessary for proinflammatory&#xD;
      cytokine production in response to viral infection in murine models. Nevertheless, the role&#xD;
      of GADD34 in cytokine production in humans remains to be elucidated. Here, we investigate the&#xD;
      interest of GADD34 in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), in which proinflammatory cytokines have an&#xD;
      important pathogenic role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A case-control study on GADD34 gene expression in PBMC of patients (n=75) with RA and age-&#xD;
      and sex-matched healthy controls (n=25). GADD34 gene expression levels in PBMC were measured&#xD;
      by quantitative PCR.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the subcellular compartment where transmembrane and&#xD;
      secreted proteins are produced. In normal conditions biosynthesis rate, folding and&#xD;
      trafficking of the proteins are tightly regulated through an efficient 'quality control'&#xD;
      system. The ER responds to the accumulation of misfolded proteins in its lumen through&#xD;
      different signaling pathways known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) [1]. Upon&#xD;
      activation, the ER transmembrane protein PERK phosphorylates the alpha subunit of the&#xD;
      eukaryotic initiation factor eIF2 [2]. Under these conditions, the transcription factor ATF4&#xD;
      directs the expression of genes involved in resistance to oxidative stress, in amino acid&#xD;
      metabolism, as well as the expression of GADD34 (Growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene&#xD;
      34) [3]. GADD34 is a regulatory subunit of PP1 phosphatase which dephosphorylates eIF2alpha&#xD;
      [4], representing a negative feedback loop of UPR, essential for protein synthesis recovery&#xD;
      and cell survival [5].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The UPR is more than just an adaptive response to unfolded protein accumulation in the ER,&#xD;
      and UPR signaling pathways intersect with immune responses at many levels [6]. In B&#xD;
      lymphocytes activation of UPR is part of the normal program of cell differentiation, playing&#xD;
      an important role in immunoglobulin synthesis [7]. ER stress has also been implicated in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of many human diseases, including metabolic, neurodegenerative diseases, and&#xD;
      cancer [8]. A direct link between UPR and inflammation has been demonstrated for the&#xD;
      development of autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease [9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic multifactorial inflammatory disease. Proinflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines, such as TNF-alpha and IL-6, secreted by macrophages and monocytes have an&#xD;
      important pathogenic role in the phases of inflammation, synovial proliferation and cartilage&#xD;
      damage [10]. Rheumatoid factor (RF) has been the most widely used antibody to diagnose RA&#xD;
      [11]; anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) have also been included in the diagnostic&#xD;
      criteria of ACR/EULAR in 2010 [12] and they are highly associated with the development of&#xD;
      erosive RA [13].&#xD;
&#xD;
      GADD34 has recently been shown to be necessary for the production of proinflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines by dendritic cells and fibroblasts exposed to double-strand RNA in a murine model&#xD;
      [14]. In fibroblasts, GADD34 expression is dependent on PKR (Protein Kinase RNA-activated)&#xD;
      activation, showing a direct link between pathogen detection and the eIF2alphaP/ATF4 pathway&#xD;
      of UPR. The importance of this link for anti-viral immunity has been demonstrated by the&#xD;
      mortality of GADD34-deficient neonate mice infected by Chikungunya virus, due to a&#xD;
      significant reduction of IFN-beta production [15]. It has been proposed that GADD34 could&#xD;
      have a qualitative role on the selection of mRNAs being translated in particular conditions,&#xD;
      such as viral infections [16]. These results suggest that GADD34 might be a key molecule of&#xD;
      inflammatory processes in human pathologies as well; however, the role of GADD34 in cytokine&#xD;
      production in humans remains to be elucidated. The aim of our study was to investigate GADD34&#xD;
      expression in RA patients.&#xD;
