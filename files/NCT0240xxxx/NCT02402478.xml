      The purpose of this study is to advance research through collaboration, 4C was established in&#xD;
      the United Kingdom (UK) in 2009 as a resource in which deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and&#xD;
      biomarker samples were obtained at time of presentation with chest pain linked to detailed&#xD;
      phenotypic data obtained from electronic health records and participant self-completed&#xD;
      questionnaires. The investigators sought to explore and assess the current potential of&#xD;
      setting up a comparable consented research platform by collecting DNA samples and to quantify&#xD;
      the extent to which diverse NHS hospital information systems are accessible for extracting&#xD;
      secondary care data (structured and unstructured) for research purposes at scale.&#xD;

      Obtaining participant consent Patients were invited to read a study information sheet and&#xD;
      encouraged to ask questions about the research, after which written informed consent was&#xD;
      sought from patients for: a) completion of a baseline health questionnaire; b) provision of a&#xD;
      blood sample for long-term storage and analysis of DNA and biomarkers; c) extraction of&#xD;
      patient data from their medical records; and d) linkage of patient data with national&#xD;
      electronic health record data sources (e.g. coded hospitalisations and procedures, emergency&#xD;
      admissions and cause-specific mortality).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size For sufficient power to detect relative risk differences of 1.2 at a 5%&#xD;
      significance level a minimum of 3000 patients was required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data collection and measures Three unique sources of data contributed to the&#xD;
      participant baseline assessment, which took place during patients' scheduled hospital&#xD;
      appointments. Research measures (biological specimens and information not routinely collected&#xD;
      during patients' clinical assessments) included 1) blood samples for DNA and biomarker&#xD;
      analysis and a 2) short health questionnaire completed by participants (usual completion time&#xD;
      5-10 minutes). Clinical measures were 3) detailed clinical information collected as part of&#xD;
      usual care, extracted from the hospital electronic health record up to six months after the&#xD;
      baseline assessment to allow time for procedure and test results to be uploaded to hospital&#xD;
      electronic systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Collection of research measures (i) Blood resource Venous blood sampling and processing of&#xD;
      samples Non-fasting blood samples were obtained from consenting participants, including those&#xD;
      in whom a diagnosis of angina was subsequently ruled out, by staff trained in venepuncture&#xD;
      during the hospital appointment. Twenty millilitres of blood was drawn to enable a wide range&#xD;
      of research measures to be obtained. Blood was drawn into five vacutainers in the following&#xD;
      order: 2x 4.0 mL ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid tube (EDTA), 1x 4.5 mL gel-separator lithium&#xD;
      heparin tube (plasma separation tube (PST)), 1x 5.0 mL gel serum separator tube (SST), 2x 4.0&#xD;
      mL, and 1x 2.5 mL PAXgene ribonucleic acid (RNA) blood tube (PreAnalytiX, Franklin Lakes,&#xD;
      NJ). Vacutainers were gently inverted and reverted up to five times to allow additives to mix&#xD;
      with the blood, labelled and temporarily stored at approximately 5째C until processing. Date&#xD;
      and time of collection was recorded. Different blood fractions were separated by&#xD;
      centrifugation at 2500 g for 10 minutes. EDTA and PST samples were centrifuged within four&#xD;
      hours after sampling and the SST sample was left to clot at room temperature for 25-30&#xD;
      minutes prior to centrifugation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EDTA plasma, heparinised plasma, serum and white cells (buffy coat) were aliquoted into a&#xD;
      total of nineteen 0.5 mL 2D QR-coded cryovial tubes suitable for long-term cryopreservation.&#xD;
      Each cryovial was individually logged in two un-linked databases using a single-tube QR-code&#xD;
      reader, placed in a 96-position rack and stored locally at -20째C. PAXgene RNA tubes were&#xD;
      stored as whole blood at -20째C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Buccal swab sample collection Consenting patients who did not provide a venous blood sample&#xD;
      were invited to provide a buccal swab for subsequent DNA extraction. Samples were collected&#xD;
      by rubbing a sterile swab firmly against the inside of the participant's cheek or between&#xD;
      their lips and the gum line for one minute. The swab was stored in a sterile container with a&#xD;
      silica gel capsule (Isohelix Dri-Capsules, Cell Projects Ltd) to stabilise the sample at room&#xD;
      temperature for up to two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples were transported in temperature-controlled shipping boxes for long-term storage at a&#xD;
      biobank at -80째C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extraction of DNA and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping DNA was extracted from&#xD;
      2556 individual participant samples and genotyping of 51 CHD-specific SNPs identified in&#xD;
      Coronary ARtery DIsease Genome wide Replication and Meta-analysis (CARDIoGRAM PlusC4D) was&#xD;
      completed, according to specification, by a company with specialised services for extraction&#xD;
      of DNA and genotyping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarkers and metabolomic profiling of patients The investigators propose to measure&#xD;
      routinely collected and novel markers that appear most promising for clinical predictive&#xD;
      value, including N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide (NT-BNP), high-sensitivity C-reactive&#xD;
      protein (hs-CRP), apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1), apolipoprotein B (apoB), lipoprotein A (Lp(a)),&#xD;
      and cystatin C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) Baseline health questionnaire All participants were invited to complete a questionnaire&#xD;
      to ascertain or validate participants' sex, level of education, ethnicity and health. General&#xD;
      health functioning was assessed using the EQ-5D, (http://www.euroqol.org/) a 5-item&#xD;
      standardised measure of health outcome. Functional chest pain was determined using the Rose&#xD;
      angina questionnaire and angina severity using the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS)&#xD;
      classification. Symptoms of depression were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9&#xD;
      (PHQ-9), which scores each of the nine Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&#xD;
      (DSM-IV 4th Edition, American Psychiatric Association) criteria for depression in the&#xD;
      PRIME-MD (Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders screening questionnaire for depressive&#xD;
      symptoms) diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. Anxiety was assessed using the&#xD;
      7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, a self-reported measure for screening and&#xD;
      quantifying severity of generalized anxiety disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iii) Extended physical examination and measures obtained in sub-study Additional measures&#xD;
      obtained from a subset of participants included a sixty-minute physical examination&#xD;
      (anthropometric measures, lung function, aortic blood pressure, pulse wave [augmentation]&#xD;
      index, pulse wave velocity and ankle brachial index), 31-hour ambulatory ECG, tri-axial&#xD;
      accelerometry and sleep measures. Sub-study participants also completed an extended health&#xD;
      questionnaire which included questions on diet and sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Extraction of clinical information from the electronic health record Trained extractors&#xD;
      reviewed hospital databases and recorded detailed clinical information onto standardised case&#xD;
      report forms. Depending on the clinic or hospital, different clinical systems were searched&#xD;
      to manually extract data that could not be downloaded or exported as a data file. Information&#xD;
      included reason(s) for referral, history of chest pain, physician-recorded risk factors for&#xD;
      coronary artery disease, previously diagnosed medical history, current medication and test&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants underwent a resting 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) as part of their routine&#xD;
      clinical assessment. An exercise tolerance test (ETT) was undertaken by an experienced&#xD;
      cardiac electrophysiologist in hospitals that performed ETTs for routine assessment of chest&#xD;
      pain. The ETT followed the modified Bruce protocol (Bruce, RA, 1963) and was conducted with&#xD;
      concurrent 12-lead electrocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were manually entered onto a research database at the study coordinating centre, cleaned&#xD;
      and coded ready for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Postal questionnaire A postal follow-up questionnaire was sent to study&#xD;
      participants after recruitment (mean time to follow-up 469 days) to assess general health&#xD;
      status (EQ-5D), functional status (Rose angina questionnaire, Seattle angina questionnaire),&#xD;
      symptoms of depression (PHQ-2) and anxiety (GAD-7) and use of nitrate medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electronic health record linkages With their consent, the investigators linked participants&#xD;
      to data from Hospital Episode Statistics, a national data warehouse of administrative data&#xD;
      containing ICD-10-coded hospital diagnoses and OPCS4-coded procedures. The investigators&#xD;
      additionally linked participants with ICD-10-coded cause-specific mortality data from the&#xD;
      Office for National Statistics. The linkages were conducted via the NHS Health and Social&#xD;
      Care Information Centre (formerly known as the NHS Information Centre) and patients were&#xD;
      identified using their NHS number (a unique ten digit numeric identifier for the NHS),&#xD;
      gender, date of birth and postcode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and management The design, conduct, analysis and reporting of the study&#xD;
      follow the methodological standards set out in the REporting recommendations for tumour&#xD;
      MARKer prognostic studies (REMARK) guidelines. To maintain confidentiality, identifiers were&#xD;
      removed from all sources of data and replaced with a unique participant study number assigned&#xD;
      at the point of enrolment. Researchers were trained to follow standardised operating&#xD;
      procedures to ensure high quality, consistent collection of data. Data were checked and&#xD;
      validated, and inconsistencies in clinical data were resolved by revisiting hospital data at&#xD;
      source.&#xD;
