  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acromegaly is associated with increased risk of difficult intubation and its management. The&#xD;
      overall incidence of difficult intubation in patients suffering from acromegaly is four to&#xD;
      five times more than those without acromegaly.The difficult intubation scenario in these&#xD;
      patients can be managed by various methods ranging from awake fiberoptic intubation to&#xD;
      tracheostomy. Difficult tracheal intubation accounts for 17% of respiratory-related injuries&#xD;
      and results in significant morbidity and mortality in general population. In patients with&#xD;
      acromegaly, inability to mask ventilate or intubate can lead to 28% of all anesthesia related&#xD;
      deaths. Therefore, the need and importance of airway assessment in patients with acromegaly&#xD;
      cannot be overemphasized. Various tests of airway assessment have to be used to assess&#xD;
      difficult airway and tracheal intubation in acromegalics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to assess the various tests of airway assessment affecting the outcome&#xD;
      of patients with acromegaly undergoing pituitary surgery and identify which was best suited.&#xD;

      All the patients of either gender, diagnosed as a case of acromegaly scheduled for pituitary&#xD;
      surgery will be enrolled. This observational study will be conducted over a period of 3&#xD;
      years. A written informed consent will be taken from all the patients. The clinical diagnosis&#xD;
      will be made on the basis of growth hormone (GH) levels and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      findings. All patients will be evaluated preoperatively, a day before surgery by an&#xD;
      independent observer. Airway assessment for difficult intubation will be performed using&#xD;
      Modified Mallampati classification in sitting and supine position followed by mouth opening,&#xD;
      upper lip bite test, measurement of thyromental, thyrohyoid, sternomental and hyomental&#xD;
      distance. Next the length of upper incisors, presence of receding mandible and neck movement&#xD;
      will be checked. An associated history of OSA will also be taken in to account for assessing&#xD;
      the difficult intubation followed by OSA grading in acromegalic patients posted for pituitary&#xD;
      surgery. In situation of difficult tracheal intubation the fiberoptic intubation would be the&#xD;
      preferred choice, which is a gold standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General anesthesia will be induced with fentanyl 2Âµg/kg, propofol 2 mg/kg and rocuronium&#xD;
      1mg/kg. After 90 seconds of mask ventilation, laryngoscopy will be performed with an&#xD;
      appropriate sized Macintosh laryngoscope and thereafter Cormac lehane grading will be noted.&#xD;
      External laryngeal manipulation (ELM) if carried out will be noted. A standard anesthesia&#xD;
      protocol will be followed. After completion of the surgery, neuromuscular blockade will be&#xD;
      reversed with neostigmine 0.05mg/kg and glycopyrrolate 0.01mg/kg intravenously. Once the&#xD;
      patient follows the verbal command and respiratory parameters are satisfactory, endotracheal&#xD;
      tube will be removed. All patients will be shifted to neurosurgical ICU for observation and&#xD;
      supportive management.&#xD;
