    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease where lymphocytes inflict damage to&#xD;
      the axons and myelin sheaths of the central nervous system. Persons with multiple sclerosis&#xD;
      (pwMS) were long advised to avoid physical activity but the benefits of exercise to improve&#xD;
      cardiovascular and cognitive functions in pwMS have become important aspects of standardized&#xD;
      rehabilitation programs. Recent findings show that the achieved adaptations through exercise&#xD;
      are associated with the intensity dependent lactate increases during exercise. This&#xD;
      dose-response relationship between the mode and the exercise intensity implicates the&#xD;
      relevance of the exercise protocol as higher exercise intensities seem to facilitate greater&#xD;
      benefits, also in pwMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study evaluates the influences of acute bout of moderate physical exercise&#xD;
      (cycling) and relaxation on cognitive functions at three time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes are the differences (at timepoint t2) of cognitive functions assessed via&#xD;
      the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test Revised&#xD;
      (BVMT-R) T1-3 of the BICAMS battery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results should into a randomised controlled Trial that investigates the specific influences&#xD;
      of a three-week training intervention on Brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF), Insulin&#xD;
      Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1) and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) as central&#xD;
      neurobiological parameters of neuroplasticity, cardiorespiratory Fitness and cognitive&#xD;
      functions.&#xD;

      Objectives To determine responses of an acute moderate exercise bout on cognitive functions&#xD;
      in pwMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparisons of different Training modes: exercise (overland cycling) versus relaxation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improvements of cognitive functionning (Memory, processing Speed) on the Symbol Digit&#xD;
           Modalities Test (SDMT) and the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test Revised (BVMT-R) T1-3&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlations between the intensity-dependent lactate increases and cognitive functions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design Two-pronged, case controlled study. Randomization of 20 MS patients into&#xD;
      a Group &quot;Exercise&quot; (n=10) - that perform 30 minutes cycling on an Ergometer - or &quot;Relaxation&#xD;
      (n=10) that perform relaxation in a comfortable and quiet environment. Both groups crossover&#xD;
      at t2 into the respective Group. The study is set into the normal rehabilitation program and&#xD;
      participants are given physician clearance, are informed about the study and give their&#xD;
      written consent before the study starts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive assessment is performed with the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and the Brief&#xD;
      Visuospatial Memory Test Revised (BVMT-R) T1-3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SDMT tests information of processing speed. The test consists of single digits paired with&#xD;
      abstract symbols. Rows of the nine symbols are arranged pseudo-randomly. The participant must&#xD;
      say the number that corresponds with each symbol. The SDMT can be completed within 5 min,&#xD;
      including instructions, practice and testing. The good psychometric properties of the SDMT&#xD;
      are well described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BVMT-R T1-3 requires the the participant to inspect a 2 × 3 stimulus array of abstract&#xD;
      geometric figures. There are three learning trials of 10 s. The array is removed and the&#xD;
      patient is required to draw the array from memory, with the correct shapes in the correct&#xD;
      position. The psychometric properties of the BVMT-R T1-3 are good. Cognitive functions are&#xD;
      assessed at time points t1 and t2 after Exercise / Relaxation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline participants perform a progressive cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) on a&#xD;
      cycle ergometer (Ergoline 800, Germany). Cardiopulmonary fitness level was monitored by&#xD;
      direct and continuous measurements (breath by breath) of maximum oxygen consumption (VO2peak)&#xD;
      by ergospirometer (PanGas, CPX, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise protocol consisted of (a) first 3 minutes at rest (no pedalling) on the cycle&#xD;
      ergometer; (b) 3 minutes of unloaded pedalling as a warm up; (c) testing phase until the&#xD;
      participant reached a symptom limited maximum. Workload was continuously ramp type increased&#xD;
      by 5-10 Watts every minute to ensure 8-12 minutes of testing; (d) the final 3 minutes were&#xD;
      unloaded pedalling to cool down. Heart rate (Polar Electro, Kempele, Finland) and blood&#xD;
      pressure (Riva Rocci) were monitored for the last 10 seconds every 2 minutes during the test.&#xD;
      The 10-point BORG scale therapy short form assessed the rate of perceived exertion (RPE) at&#xD;
      phases (c) and (d). Peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) was defined as the highest VO2 value&#xD;
      when the following criteria were attained: respiratory equivalent ratio (RER) &gt; 1.10; peak&#xD;
      heart rate (HRpeak) within 10 min-1 of age predicted maximum and rating of exertion (RPE &gt;&#xD;
      8.5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise bout consists of 30 minutes physiologically defined heart rate controlled&#xD;
      cycling at 50-60 rounds per minutes (rpm) at the lactate threshold (equal to 75% of HRpeak or&#xD;
      60% VO2max).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relaxation consists of 30 minutes resting in a comfortable and quiet surrounding. Exercise&#xD;
      and Relaxation are performed at timepoints t1 and t2.&#xD;
