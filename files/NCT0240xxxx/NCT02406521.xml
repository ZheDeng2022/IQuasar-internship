  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is comparing different drug combinations as a possible treatment for&#xD;
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) and bone metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study interventions involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Combination of Radium-223 and Sorafenib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Combination of Radium-223 and Pazopanib&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the combination of sorafenib&#xD;
      and radium-223 or the combination of pazopanib and radium-223 as a treatment for any disease.&#xD;
      Sorafenib and pazopanib are both approved as single agents for the treatment of metastatic&#xD;
      renal cell carcinoma. Additionally, radium-223 is FDA approved for the treatment of advanced&#xD;
      prostate cancer and has shown to have effects on prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are limited options for patients with metastatic renal cell cancer who also&#xD;
      have bone metastases. Bone metastases are related to a higher incidence of skeletal&#xD;
      complications, including skeletal pain, fractures, spinal cord compression, and an increase&#xD;
      in the amount of calcium in blood. Such skeletal complications could result in radiation or&#xD;
      surgery to the bone. Since radium-223 is shown to be effective for patients with metastatic&#xD;
      prostate cancer who also have bone metastases, researchers want to explore radium-223 with&#xD;
      VEGF-targeting therapies to understand how the drug combinations affect safety, quality of&#xD;
      life, incidence of skeletal complications, and the progression of cancer.&#xD;
