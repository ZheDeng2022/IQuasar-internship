    <textblock>
      Background: Propofol effects dose-dependent myocardial depression, but there is little&#xD;
      clinical data available regarding the direct impact of propofol induction on myocardial&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of propofol-based anesthesia&#xD;
      induction on cardiac function in low-risk patients.&#xD;

      Study population After approval by the institutional ethics committee and written informed&#xD;
      consent, we prospectively enrolled adult patients who were scheduled for elective non-cardiac&#xD;
      surgery. During the preoperative anesthesia visit, we selected patients with low-risk as&#xD;
      indicated by the revised cardiac risk index of 0 and normal LV function (ejection fraction ≥&#xD;
      60% and septal e' ≥ 8 cm/s). We excluded patients with an arrhythmia, poor lateral axis in&#xD;
      supine position, regional wall motion abnormality, or other structural heart diseases.&#xD;
      Patients with any of the following conditions were also excluded: unfavorable airway or&#xD;
      facemask fit, intractable coughing, hiccups, or hypotension (mean BP &lt; 60 mmHg) requiring IV&#xD;
      positive inotropes or vasoconstrictors during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia induction Upon each patient's arrival at the holding area, we placed an 18-gauge&#xD;
      IV line in the right forearm vein and administered 10 mL/kg/hour of lactated Ringer's&#xD;
      solution, 0.2 mg of glycopyrrolate, and 0.03 mg/kg of midazolam, as a premedication. Once in&#xD;
      the operation room, we started to monitor electrocardiography, non-invasive BP, HR, pulse&#xD;
      oximeter oxygen saturation, and the bispectral index (BIS). Anaesthesia induction was started&#xD;
      in the following manner. Patients took a spontaneous respiration with inspired oxygen (8&#xD;
      L/min) through a transparent facemask and a circulation system with a reservoir bag. Bolus&#xD;
      propofol (2.0 mg/kg) was administered intravenously for 10 seconds, after which assisted&#xD;
      ventilation followed. After 5 minutes, complete induction was confirmed via a lack of&#xD;
      train-of-four response and followed by tracheal intubation for maintenance anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative transthoracic echocardiography: Imaging After positioning the patient supine&#xD;
      on the operation table, serial transthoracic echocardiography was performed with a portable&#xD;
      GE Vivid Q platform (General Electric, Milwaukee, WI), before (T0) and 1, 3, and 5 minutes&#xD;
      after the propofol bolus injection (T1, T2 and T3, respectively) along with hemodynamic&#xD;
      recordings at the same time (BP, HR, and BIS). Two-dimensional imaging of parasternal and&#xD;
      apical views and pulsed wave (PW) Doppler imaging of mitral inflow &amp; LV outflow were&#xD;
      performed. DTI was recorded at both septal and lateral mitral annulus from the apical&#xD;
      4-chamber view to determine longitudinal endocardial velocities with a sweep of 66.7 mm/s.&#xD;
      Each set of images required less than 30 seconds.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes of more than 20% difference of Doppler myocardial tissue systolic motion after propofol administration</measure>
    <time_frame>1minute, 3 minutes, 5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Anesthesia was induced by intravenous propofol (2.0 mg/kg). We measured tissue Doppler-derived indexes of systolic myocardial motion (S') before and then 1, 3, and 5 minutes after propofol administration. We compared the serial changes by repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc analyses. More than 20% reduction considered clinically relevant.</description>
