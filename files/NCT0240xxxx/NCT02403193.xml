      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, feasibility and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of the administration of PBF-509 (Adenosine A2a receptor antagonist) as&#xD;
      single agent or in combination with PDR001 (programmed cell death 1 receptor antibody (PD-1&#xD;
      Ab)) to NSCLC patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single institution phase I/Ib (dose escalation plus expansion) clinical trial of PBF-509&#xD;
      and combination treatment of PDR001 plus PBF-509 in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)&#xD;
      0-1 patients with immunotherapy naïve and pretreated, advanced or metastatic NSCLC will be&#xD;
      conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of the proposed Phase I trial will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I Dose Escalation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of PBF-509 during a phase I dose escalation&#xD;
           trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of PBF-509&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the safety profile of PBF-509&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 Dose Expansion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To further determine safety and tolerability of PBF-509 at the recommended phase II dose&#xD;
      (RP2D)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Ib Dose Escalation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the dose limiting toxicities (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and&#xD;
           recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of PBF-509 in combination with PDR001&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of PBF-509 in combination with PDR001&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Ib Expansion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of PBF-509 in combination with PDR001, at the&#xD;
           RP2D, in both immunotherapy naïve and pretreated advanced NSCLC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the response rate (ORR) of PBF-509 in combination with PDR001, at the RP2D,&#xD;
           in both immunotherapy naïve and pretreated advanced NSCLC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the progression free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of PBF-509 in&#xD;
           combination with PDR001, at the RP2D, in both immunotherapy naïve and pretreated&#xD;
           advanced NSCLC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of PBF-509 in combination with PDR001&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlative (Exploratory) Studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the biological activity of PBF-509 alone and in combination with PDR001 by&#xD;
           assessment of potential pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers in tumor biopsy specimens of&#xD;
           patients with advanced NSCLC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine association of pre- or on-treatment expression of other immune checkpoints&#xD;
           genes with resistance to single agent PBF-509 and dual immune inhibitory (PDR001+&#xD;
           PBF-509) treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of PDR001 in combination with PBF-509&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase I and phase Ib dose escalations will be conducted utilizing the standard 3+3 dose&#xD;
      escalation method. Pharmacokinetic (PK) data will be obtained for PBF-509 and PDR001.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase Ib dose expansion will consist of 2 independent groups of immunotherapy naïve and&#xD;
      pretreated (previous immune checkpoint inhibitors; anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1 and/or&#xD;
      combinations) patients. Pharmacodynamic (PD) data will be obtained for potential biomarker&#xD;
      analysis with pre-treatment and on-treatment tumor biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I Dose escalation and safety expansion: 15-18 patients will be treated with single&#xD;
      agent PBF-509 in escalation and up to 20 patients may be treated at the RP2D as a safety&#xD;
      expansion group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Ib Dose escalation: 15-24 patients will be treated&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific number of patients enrolled will vary depending on whether additional patients&#xD;
      could be required during the escalation period if dose de-escalation cohorts or intermediate&#xD;
      doses are enrolled, or when a dose-escalation cohort is expanded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Ib Dose Expansion: 20 patients per group will be enrolled for a total of 40 patients.&#xD;
      Assuming 10-15% eligibility/screen failures, a maximum 50 patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximun tolerated dose (MTD) evaluation will be based on the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)&#xD;
      Evaluable Population which includes all patients enrolled in the dose-escalation portion of&#xD;
      the trial, who receive the protocol-assigned treatment with PDR001 and PBF-509 and complete&#xD;
      the safety follow-up through the DLT evaluation period, or experience a DLT during the DLT&#xD;
      evaluation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety evaluation will be based on the treated Population, which includes all patients&#xD;
      who receive any dose of investigational product, and will include adverse events (AEs),&#xD;
      serious adverse event (SAEs), laboratory evaluations and electrocardiogram (ECG) results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AEs will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for&#xD;
      Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.03 and described by system organ class and preferred tem using&#xD;
      the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Clinically relevant Laboratory&#xD;
      abnormalities with toxicity grades according to the NCI CTCAE v4.03 will be derived and&#xD;
      summarized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy analysis will be based on the treated Population which includes all patients who&#xD;
      receive any dose of either investigational product. The following efficacy endpoints will be&#xD;
      analyzed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as confirmed complete response (CR) or partial&#xD;
           response (PR) based on modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)&#xD;
           v1.1. Disease control rate (DCR) is defined as CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) based on&#xD;
           modified RECIST v1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Duration of response (DoR) is defined as the duration from the first documentation of&#xD;
           Objective response (OR) to the first documented disease progression or death due to any&#xD;
           cause, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Progression-free survival (PFS) will be measured from the start of treatment until the&#xD;
           documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Overall survival (OS) will be determined as the time from the start of treatment with&#xD;
           PDR001 and PBF-509 until death due to any cause&#xD;
