      Dementia (Alzheimer's Disease) is sometimes called &quot;Type 3 Diabetes&quot; because of the strong&#xD;
      connection between Type 2 diabetes (a function of insulin resistance) with Dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore hypothesize that Reducing Insulin Resistance using Intensive&#xD;
      Lifestyle Intervention (Exercise and Weight loss) + Metformin Treatment in Prediabetic &amp;&#xD;
      diet-control-only Diabetic overweight and mildly cognitively impaired individuals 55 years or&#xD;
      older would lead to better Cognitive Function (compared to standard care) after 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be monitored and assessed using a battery of Cognitive and psychological tests&#xD;
      and PET scans to demonstrate glucose utilization in the relevant areas of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This 3-year open-label study aims to recruit 360 subjects with 50% (180 subjects) randomized&#xD;
      to receiving Intensive lifestyle intervention with Metformin (if diabetic) vs the other 50%&#xD;
      who would receive only the usual standard level of care in the primary care setting.&#xD;

      General Introduction In this trial, the drug to be studied is Metformin. It is an&#xD;
      insulin-sensitizing biguanide which has long been used safely as an effective antidiabetic&#xD;
      drug for patients with type II diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for the Study Purpose Dementia is a clinical syndrome due to multiple aetiologies,&#xD;
      of which Alzheimer disease (AD) and Vascular Dementia (VaD) are the two most common. Dementia&#xD;
      represents the advanced stage of a syndrome spectrum of cognitive impairment, an&#xD;
      age-associated neurodegenerative condition that includes ageing related cognitive disorder&#xD;
      (aka age-associated memory impairment or subject memory impairment, i.e. memory loss without&#xD;
      other cognitive problems and are within normal limits given the person's age), and Mild&#xD;
      Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a clinical entity that includes memory and cognitive impairment&#xD;
      but no significant functional disability to meet threshold criteria for diagnosis of&#xD;
      dementia. Of note, MCI is considered a prodromal state of dementia that increases the risk of&#xD;
      subsequently developing dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MCI can be classified into two main categories: (1) amnestic MCI and (2) non-amnestic MCI.&#xD;
      Each MCI subtype can be further classified according to the presumed aetiology: degenerative;&#xD;
      vascular; psychiatric; or traumatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Amnestic MCI (aMCI, prominent memory impairment with possibly mild degrees of impairment&#xD;
           in other cognitive domains),&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Non-amnestic MCI (non-aMCI, in which memory is largely unaffected but other domains of&#xD;
           cognitive and behavioural functioning are impaired).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently available drugs approved for AD (anticholinesterases and Memantine) have limited&#xD;
      efficacy and do not alter the pathophysiological basis of disease nor disease progression. No&#xD;
      drugs are currently approved by regulatory authorities specifically for the treatment of MCI.&#xD;
      Because treatments are less effective when the disease is far advanced, individuals with MCI&#xD;
      at earlier stages of their illness are likely better candidates for clinical trials.&#xD;
      Neuropathology-based studies of &quot;clinically non-demented&quot; individuals show high burdens of&#xD;
      vascular and AD types of pathology. MCI may therefore be a pathologically-based preclinical&#xD;
      or early clinical phase of dementia that is likely to progress to AD or VaD, and is hence an&#xD;
      appropriate predementia syndrome for therapeutic intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular-related Risk Factors. Prior research up to date amply supports the hugely important&#xD;
      role of vascular-related risk factors in the aetiology of both AD and VaD. Because&#xD;
      vascular-related risk factors are treatable, it should be possible to prevent, postpone or&#xD;
      mitigate VaD as well as AD (to the extent due to the vascular contribution of its aetiology).&#xD;
      The vascular and related factors that have been associated with dementia and cognitive&#xD;
      decline include diabetes and insulin resistance, high blood pressure (BP) and hypertension,&#xD;
      total cholesterol and other lipid parameters, body mass index (BMI) and obesity, and the&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome (MetS). MetS is a clustering of cardiovascular risk factors related to&#xD;
      central obesity including impaired glucose metabolism, dyslipidaemia, and high BP that is&#xD;
      associated with increased risk for both Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and coronary artery&#xD;
      disease (CAD). MetS has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of predementia&#xD;
      syndromes including age-related cognitive decline, MCI and VaD, albeit with mixed findings of&#xD;
      associations with AD. Insulin resistance is widely considered to play the central role in the&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanism of MetS. Hence, lifestyle and therapeutic interventions targeted&#xD;
      at lowering insulin resistance is a promising MCI treatment option with the aim to slow&#xD;
      cognitive decline and prevent or delay progression to dementia due to AD and/or VaD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of insulin resistance in MCI and dementia Insulin and insulin resistance play&#xD;
      important roles and functions in the central nervous system and the development of&#xD;
      age-related neurodegenerative diseases, including glucose metabolism, vascular function,&#xD;
      synaptic maintenance, beta-amyloid regulation, and tau phosphorylation. Insulin is&#xD;
      transported across the blood-brain barrier, and brain insulin receptors are selectively&#xD;
      localized in key brain regions, such as hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and frontal cortex,&#xD;
      where it plays a direct role in modulating levels of important neurotransmitters, synaptic&#xD;
      plasticity, learning and memory. Insulin has also been shown to regulate the metabolism of&#xD;
      beta-amyloid and tau, the building blocks of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles&#xD;
      which are the neuropathological hallmarks of AD. Peripheral hyperinsulinemia promotes&#xD;
      oxidative stress, protein glycosylation and cerebral ischemia and impairs the clearance of&#xD;
      amyloid beta in the brain through competition for insulin degrading enzyme (IDE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic patients are more likely to manifest impaired cognitive function, cognitive decline&#xD;
      and a significantly higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia. Both&#xD;
      hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance (IR) have also been shown in population-based studies&#xD;
      to be associated with poor cognitive function in older persons. Hippocampal volumes were&#xD;
      smaller in diabetic patients and in those with increased insulin resistance than in normal&#xD;
      healthy controls. Several mechanisms are likely to explain the increased risk of cognitive&#xD;
      impairment in T2D. Insulin resistance as mentioned above has been shown to play a direct role&#xD;
      in cognitive impairment in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Additionally, chronic&#xD;
      hyperglycaemia has been shown to be associated with decreased cerebral blood flow, decreased&#xD;
      glucose transport across the blood brain barrier, reduced cerebral glucose metabolism and&#xD;
      microvascular changes from endothelial damage. Finally, metabolic and vascular risk factors&#xD;
      such as dyslipidaemia and hypertension which are closely linked to IR and T2D have been shown&#xD;
      to predict cerebrovascular disease, cognitive decline and dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lowering Insulin Resistance Recent data support the development of therapeutics that target&#xD;
      insulin pathways and particularly the lowering of insulin resistance as potential treatments&#xD;
      for AD. Insulin administration reduces neuronal accumulation of beta-amyloid peptides and&#xD;
      synaptic binding of toxic beta-amyloid derived diffusible ligands in cell culture; it&#xD;
      improves cognitive performance in rodents and reportedly in patients with early AD.&#xD;
      Insulin-sensitizers like peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR- gamma) have&#xD;
      been reported to improve insulin sensitivity, decrease inflammation and inhibit&#xD;
      A-beta-stimulated secretion of pro-inflammatory products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rosiglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that stimulate PPAR-gamma and has been shown to inhibit&#xD;
      beta-amyloid production. This insulin sensitizer is used as an oral drug (Avandia) effective&#xD;
      in the treatment and prevention of diabetes. However, recent concerns about increased&#xD;
      cardiovascular mortality has restricted its use in diabetic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial reports suggest that Rosiglitazone is a promising drug in the treatment of AD.&#xD;
      Positive effects on cognitive function have been reported in preclinical animal studies and a&#xD;
      handful of preliminary clinical studies. However, these findings have not been confirmed&#xD;
      subsequently by Phase III trials of patients with mild to moderate AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A growing consensus about treatment trials of AD is that they may be conducted at too late in&#xD;
      the disease process for them to be effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless an abundance of data strongly supports the central role of underlying metabolic&#xD;
      pathogenesis in AD and VaD. Agents which modify insulin sensitivity remain as therapeutic&#xD;
      options highly worthy of further inquiry. As rosiglitazone is a substrate for the&#xD;
      multidrug-resistant gene product permeability glycoprotein, it may not have high penetration&#xD;
      through the blood-brain barrier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metformin, however, is an insulin-sensitizing biguanide has long been used safely as an&#xD;
      effective antidiabetic drug for patients with T2D and is the only antidiabetic drug that has&#xD;
      been conclusively shown to prevent cardiovascular complications of diabetes. It has been&#xD;
      shown that metformin evidently crosses the blood-brain barrier, accumulates in the brain and&#xD;
      acts directly on the central nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major mechanism of metformin action is activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK),&#xD;
      which plays a key role in cellular energy homeostasis, insulin signalling, and the metabolism&#xD;
      of glucose and fats. The activation of AMP-activated protein kinase and anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      actions of metformin has been shown to occur not only in peripheral tissues but also in the&#xD;
      brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is hitherto no published report of the effect of metformin treatment on cognitive&#xD;
      outcomes in diabetic patients. Recently, the investigators have completed a 4 year follow-up&#xD;
      study of older diabetic patients and have found that long term metformin use of ≥6 years was&#xD;
      prospectively associated with lower risk of cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metformin is an oral antidiabetic drug in the biguanide class. It is the first-line drug of&#xD;
      choice for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, in particular, in overweight and obese people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, the dosage schedule of metformin is only 250 mg thrice a day, (up-titrated&#xD;
      weekly from a starting dose of 250 mg once a day). Despite its well-documented tolerability,&#xD;
      this proposed weekly incremental dosage is designed to further reduce possible side-effects&#xD;
      to drug-naive diabetic subjects taking Metformin for the 1st time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The novel strategy of lowering insulin resistance with dietary modification and&#xD;
      exercise in combination with a commonly used safe anti-diabetic medication, metformin could&#xD;
      help to slow down cognitive decline and dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population Chinese patients are used as this proposed clinical trial builds upon and&#xD;
      also uses the patients of our on-going Singapore Longitudinal Ageing Studies (SLAS) Study,&#xD;
      where only Chinese Patients are used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      360 Chinese patients with prediabetes or diabetes with MCI will be identified and recruited&#xD;
      from the community and primary care clinics in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Singapore Longitudinal Ageing Studies (SLAS): SLAS-1 cohort in South East Region and&#xD;
           SLAS-2 cohort in South West Region.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Marine Parade Polyclinic and Geylang Polyclinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Summary 24-month randomized controlled parallel-group study (IRMCI Study) of&#xD;
      overweight-or-obese pre-diabetes older patients (IRMCI-1) or untreated type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      (IRMCI-2) older patients, all with amnestic MCI or non-amnestic multi-domain MCI, will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned within Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) positive and ApoE4 negative strata to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. IRMCI-1 (prediabetic patients): Active Intervention (Intensive lifestyle modification)&#xD;
           or Control group (standard lifestyle recommendations).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. IRMCI-2 (diabetic patients): Active Intervention (Intensive lifestyle modification) plus&#xD;
           metformin (Glucophage, 250mg thrice daily) or Control group (standard lifestyle&#xD;
           recommendations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive screening and diagnostic assessments are performed using the Mini mental State&#xD;
      Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale (MoCA), and a comprehensive&#xD;
      Neuropsychological Test Battery that will assess performance on multiple cognitive domains&#xD;
      (Memory, Story Memory, Language, Executive function, Visual-Spatial and Constructional&#xD;
      ability and Attention.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Subjects with age-and education-adjusted MMSE&lt;26 or MOCA&lt;26 or memory and non-memory&#xD;
      domains test score that is 1.0 Standard Deviation (SD) or more below age-education adjusted&#xD;
      norms are evaluated by Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale. Subjects with a CDR global score&#xD;
      of 0.5 together with Sum of Boxes of ≥3 or global score of ≥1 denoting dementia undergo a&#xD;
      structured clinical assessment including neurologic examination, laboratory tests and final&#xD;
      review by an expert panel of neurologists and psychiatrists, for final diagnosis and&#xD;
      sub-classification of MCI, according to an standard SLAS protocol already established for the&#xD;
      assessment and diagnosis of MCI and dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:Subjects will be split into 2 Groups namely (1) Pre-Diabetic and (2) Diabetic.&#xD;
      Each of these 2 groups will be stratified with APOE 4 allele as a stratification factor. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Prediabetic group will thus be similarly stratified into (B) Prediabetic-APOE4+ and (A)&#xD;
      Prediabetic-APOE4-.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Diabetic group will thus be stratified into (D) Diabetic-APOE4+ and (C) Diabetic-APOE4-.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of these four groups (A), (B), (C), &amp; (D) will have their individual list of 360&#xD;
      randomization numbers generated by NUS Research Fellow using SAS computer programme. Each of&#xD;
      these 360 x 4 numbers will be individually sealed in envelopes that will be numbered and used&#xD;
      serially (from 0001st to 0360th for each group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have their Diabetic/Prediabetic status and APOE4+or- status determined using&#xD;
      existing and baseline laboratory tests. They will then be assigned accordingly to the&#xD;
      appropriate group [ ie (A), (B), (C), &amp; (D)]. Trained nurses will then assign subjects to&#xD;
      treatment vs control arm using the treatment allocation determined within the serially&#xD;
      allotted sealed envelopes. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will not be any blinding as this is an open-labelled randomised controlled trial.&#xD;
