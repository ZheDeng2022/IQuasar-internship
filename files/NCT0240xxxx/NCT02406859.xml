  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An injury to the spinal cord results in a number of secondary medical problems, including the&#xD;
      inability to voluntarily control the bowels. Depending on the severity and location of the&#xD;
      injury, remaining bowel function differs, and can include any combination of the following:&#xD;
      constipation (prolonged stool retention), difficulty with evacuation (difficultly moving&#xD;
      bowels), fecal incontinence (problems retaining stool until it is appropriate to move the&#xD;
      bowels). Most of the current medications and treatment options address problems of&#xD;
      constipation and difficulty with evacuation, but there are few options for individuals who&#xD;
      suffer from incontinency. In this study, the investigators propose to study, in detail,&#xD;
      anorectal muscle function in individuals with spinal injury - the investigators will do so&#xD;
      using new technology called high resolution manometry - which will present the investigator&#xD;
      with a 3 dimensional representation of the pressure profile of the anorectal muscles as the&#xD;
      subject attempts different maneuvers. A subgroup with representatives of all levels and&#xD;
      completeness of injury and anorectal muscle function will be enrolled to participate in six&#xD;
      weeks of biofeedback training to see if their bowel function can be improved. During these&#xD;
      six weeks, the subjects will be asked to visit the laboratory twice a week in order to be&#xD;
      trained by the research team on how to improve their anorectal strength and function in&#xD;
      response to visual cues. After the six weeks, another manometry study will be performed.&#xD;
      Subjects will then be sent home and asked to perform a series of home exercises for another 6&#xD;
      weeks, after which they will asked to return for a third and final manometry study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Neurogenic bowel characteristics differ among spinal cord injured (SCI) individuals, and&#xD;
      appear to depend primarily on the level and completeness of injury. It is thought that upper&#xD;
      motor neuron lesions in the spinal cord above L1-2 results in a hyperreflexive bowel with&#xD;
      increased colonic wall tone and loss of cortical control over the relaxation of the external&#xD;
      anal sphincter (EAS). These changes result in chronic high sphincter tone and dyssynergic&#xD;
      defecation. The main symptoms in these patients are constipation and fecal retention, or&#xD;
      difficulty with evacuation (DWE). In many of these individuals, some nerve connections&#xD;
      between the spinal cord and the colon may be preserved, and stool propulsion and reflex&#xD;
      coordination may remain intact and under control of the central nervous system. Furthermore,&#xD;
      individuals with spinal lesions above T7 experience loss of voluntary control over abdominal&#xD;
      muscles and an inability to increase intra-abdominal pressure, which results in more DWE and&#xD;
      constipation. Lower motor neuron (LMN) lesions in the spinal cord below L1-2 result in the&#xD;
      interruption of the centrally mediated innervation to the bowel, which causes slowing of&#xD;
      peristalsis, a flaccid EAS, and atonic levator ani muscles. This is also called an areflexic&#xD;
      bowel. The main symptoms in these patients are constipation from slowed peristalsis and fecal&#xD;
      incontinence (FI) from atonic EAS and levator ani muscles. While the symptoms of bowel&#xD;
      dysfunction in persons with SCI are known, function and motility of the anal canal have not&#xD;
      been documented in this population. Anorectal manometry can provide valuable information&#xD;
      about sphincter strength, defecation dynamics and reflex mechanisms. New high-resolution&#xD;
      anorectal manometric systems (Given Imaging, Duluth, GA), simultaneously captures pressure&#xD;
      data from the rectum, IAS, EAS and atmosphere. High resolution manometry also allows for much&#xD;
      clearer display of pressure events compared to line tracing series, and direction of&#xD;
      contractions are much easier to discern. To date, anorectal high resolution topographical&#xD;
      studies have not been conducted in a SCI population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modalities in which the patient can be trained to control the internal anal sphincter (IAS)&#xD;
      and EAS are promising solutions to FI, and have been shown to be useful in able bodied (AB)&#xD;
      populations. For example, anorectal biofeedback methods teach patients to recognize&#xD;
      sensations of a distended rectum while also teaching abdominal or pelvic muscles to&#xD;
      voluntarily contract for short periods of time in order to improve continence. Such&#xD;
      biofeedback modalities have also been shown to decrease constipation in AB populations by&#xD;
      teaching proper external sphincter relaxation and rectal muscle contraction. The concept of&#xD;
      biofeedback is based on principles of operant conditioning, in which information concerning a&#xD;
      normally subconscious physiological function in relayed to patients and that become actively&#xD;
      engaged in learning to consciously control this function. During bowel (re)training programs,&#xD;
      patients are provided with visual feedback on voluntary and reflex sphincter and rectal&#xD;
      muscle contractions, so that they can learn to recognize diffuse sensations and gradually&#xD;
      regain control.&#xD;
