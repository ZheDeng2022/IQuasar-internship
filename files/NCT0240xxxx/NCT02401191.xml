      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the safety of twice-daily fexofenadine 60 mg/phenylephrine 10 mg (FEX60/PE10)&#xD;
      combination tablet in patients with allergic rhinitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effectiveness of a twice-daily FEX60/PE10 combination tablet on nasal&#xD;
      symptoms (sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion), and daily activity impairment.&#xD;
