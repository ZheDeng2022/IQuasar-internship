  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether using extra doses of aspart insulin to correct&#xD;
      blood sugars before meals improves the care of patients with type 2 diabetes in the hospital&#xD;
      who are already receiving the standard of care treatment with glargine and aspart insulin&#xD;
      injections to control blood sugar levels. Studies done in the past indicate that blood sugar&#xD;
      levels are controlled on the standard treatment of insulin and that most patients do not need&#xD;
      the small extra dose of insulin at bedtime. The investigators want to test if there is any&#xD;
      benefit to giving patients extra doses of insulin during the day to correct the high blood&#xD;
      sugars.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The management of patients with Type 2 diabetes involves treatment with two different types&#xD;
      of insulin injections to control blood sugar levels. The doses of the two types of insulins,&#xD;
      glargine insulin and aspart insulin are adjusted daily through the hospital stay based on&#xD;
      blood sugar levels. Many times, in addition to glargine and aspart insulin at meals,&#xD;
      additional small doses of aspart insulin are given to correct high blood sugar levels. It has&#xD;
      not been determined if using these extra doses of aspart insulin to correct blood sugars&#xD;
      before meals improves care of the patients. Studies done in the past indicate that blood&#xD;
      sugar levels are well controlled on the standard treatment of the two insulins and that most&#xD;
      patients do not need the small extra dose of insulin at bedtime. This study will test if&#xD;
      insulin supplementation improves glycemic control and prevents hypoglycemia in insulin&#xD;
      treated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
