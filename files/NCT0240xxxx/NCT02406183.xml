  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis of advanced metastatic melanoma remains poor although a breakthrough has been&#xD;
      achieved with the novel anti-CTLA-4 treatment (ipilimumab) for a subset of patients.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, due to immune resistance, the majority of patients do not obtain long-lasting&#xD;
      clinical benefit. Radiotherapy is able to interfere with immune resistance by inducing&#xD;
      immunogenic cell death. Preclinical evidence indicates that combining radiotherapy with&#xD;
      anti-CTLA-4 treatment increases response rates compared to single agent treatment. These data&#xD;
      are supported by several spectacular clinical cases and one retrospective study. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that combining ipilimumab with radiotherapy will result in a higher&#xD;
      response rate compared to ipilimumab or radiotherapy in monotherapy. Given the complexity of&#xD;
      the interaction in anti-tumor immunity, the first goal of this project is to assess the&#xD;
      safety of the combined treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The safety profiles of ipilimumab and SBRT are well studied separately 22-24, but prospective&#xD;
      data on the combination of ipilimumab and high-dose SBRT are lacking. Consequently, the first&#xD;
      goal of the proposed prospective phase I trial is to assess the safety (dose limiting&#xD;
      toxicity, DLT) of the combination of high-dose SBRT and ipilimumab in patients with advanced&#xD;
      melanoma.&#xD;
