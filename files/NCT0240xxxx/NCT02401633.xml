  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is one of the leading causes of mortality in the&#xD;
      industrialized world. Bystander CPR before arrival of the Emergency Medical Service (EMS) is&#xD;
      a positive predictor of survival. During the last decade, the best form of bystander CPR has&#xD;
      been debated. Chest Compression Only CPR (CO-CPR) has been advocated as a preferable method&#xD;
      in situations where the bystander has no previous knowledge in CPR, both because its believed&#xD;
      to be equally efficient but also a simplified form of CPR that could lead to a higher&#xD;
      incidence of bystander-CPR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to perform av run-in period with focus on safety and feasibility&#xD;
      prior to the launch of a larger randomized trial which has a primary end-point of survival.&#xD;
      This study will compare OHCA with standard CPR (S-CPR; chest compressions and rescue breaths&#xD;
      in a 30:2 fashion) compared to CO-CPR.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Witnessed cases of OHCA with a non-asphyctic aetiology will be the principal study&#xD;
      population. According to current guidelines an unresponsive patient with no or agonal&#xD;
      breathing is treated as a suspected case of OHCA at the dispatch centre. These cases are&#xD;
      eligible for screening for inclusion. If the case is witnessed, the bystander has previous&#xD;
      knowledge in CPR and no exclusion criteria are present, the case can be included in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention consists of instructions from a dispatcher at the dispatch centre to&#xD;
      bystanders to perform either CO-CPR (intervention) or S-CPR (control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instructions to bystanders on how to perform CO-CPR consists of continuous chest compressions&#xD;
      without interruptions or rescue breaths. The instructions on how to perform S-CPR in the&#xD;
      control group include information on giving chest compressions and rescue breaths in a 30:2&#xD;
      ratio (like current CPR recommendation state).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a national study were all dispatch centers in Sweden participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall study project is conducted in three different phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pre study RUN-IN period, for establishing logistical and technical study procedures&#xD;
           (completed)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. PILOT STUDY, with focus feasibility, logistics and safety (Active, not recruting)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. MAIN STUDY will focus on 30 days survival (primary end point) and other important&#xD;
           clinical outcomes (secondary outcomes)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective pre study RUN-IN period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to test the technical inclusion procedures, logistics, feasibility and data&#xD;
      collection a pre-study RUN-IN period started in Stockholm during 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective PILOT study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the PILOT study is to assess safety and feasibility of the TANGO2 trial design, as&#xD;
      well as intermediate clinical outcomes. The TANGO2 trial started recruitment of patients on&#xD;
      January 1st 2017 and last patient was included on December 31st 2018. All patients from the&#xD;
      PILOT study will be included in the MAIN STUDY in a seamless design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective MAIN study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the MAIN study is to evaluate whether survival to 30 days following instructions&#xD;
      to perform CO-CPR is non-inferior compared to instructions to perform S-CPR bystanders in&#xD;
      witnessed OHCA where the bystander has previous CPR training. Secondary and exploratory&#xD;
      objectives include the evaluation of neurological favorable survival, return of spontaneous&#xD;
      circulation, admission to hospital, long-term survival and other clinical outcome variables&#xD;
      as well as evaluations of 30-day survival between CO-CPR and S-CPR in pre-specified&#xD;
      subgroups. The MAIN study will include patients from the PILOT phase in a seamless design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiences from the pre study RUN-IN period and implications for the PILOT and MAIN studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pre-study RUN-IN period started in Stockholm County in 2015 and analysis were performed&#xD;
      during 2016. After continuous technological adjustments, the randomization module was&#xD;
      integrated within the computer aided dispatch system and was found to functioned well in the&#xD;
      end of 2016. However, during pre-study RUN-IN period, one major obstacle was identified. Due&#xD;
      to unexpected technological matters and an unanticipated new organization of the dispatch&#xD;
      centers in Sweden only about 15% of the cardiac arrest calls for patients suffering cardiac&#xD;
      arrest in Stockholm were actually answered by dispatchers in Stockholm; all other calls were&#xD;
      transferred to other dispatch centers throughout Sweden. This meant that the dispatchers had&#xD;
      to consider the geographical site of the suspected cardiac arrest and remember if that area&#xD;
      was part of the study area. This new organization and logistics, were the call could be made&#xD;
      in one area and answered and handled at another site and county during the pre-study RUN-IN&#xD;
      period, resulted in a far greatly slower inclusion rate than anticipated and made a correct&#xD;
      follow-up of patients unmanageable and unreliable. This made it impossible to conduct a PILOT&#xD;
      study in Stockholm only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a consequence, a decision was made by the steering committee:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) To move the start of the PILOT study forward, until completion of the national expansion&#xD;
      of the study and not to start inclusion of patients into the PILOT study before January 1st&#xD;
      2017. The new length of the PILOT study was set to two years to assure sufficient inclusion&#xD;
      of patients to assess safety in terms of survival to hospital admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) That the PILOT study seamlessly will move on into the MAIN study in an inferentially&#xD;
      seamless manner after the PILOT phase inclusion ended on Dec 31 2018. This means that&#xD;
      patients from the PILOT study will also be included in the MAIN survival study. The outcomes&#xD;
      for the PILOT study were changed to not interfere with the primary endpoint of the main&#xD;
      survival study (30-day survival).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and Exclusion criteria remained unchanged throughout the TANGO2-project.&#xD;
