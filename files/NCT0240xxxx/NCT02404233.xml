  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current HIV treatment guidelines recommend the use of triple-drug therapy (two nucleoside&#xD;
      reverse transcriptase inhibitors and either a protease inhibitor, non-nucleoside reverse&#xD;
      transcriptase inhibitor, or an integrase inhibitor) for the treatment of antiretroviral&#xD;
      (ARV)-naïve patients. With the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART),&#xD;
      patients with HIV are living much longer. With the increasing lifespan of persons with HIV,&#xD;
      long-term complications from therapy as well as the occurrence of co-morbidities with aging&#xD;
      have prompted HCPs to re-think the current treatment paradigm and consider novel combinations&#xD;
      of ARVs. All of the currently approved HIV antiretrovirals have been implicated in causing&#xD;
      long-term toxicities; however the greatest body of evidence for long-term metabolic effects&#xD;
      has implicated the nucleoside reverse transcriptase (NRTI) class. By utilizing a non-NRTI&#xD;
      treatment regimen, it is hypothesized that many of these long-term metabolic effects (renal&#xD;
      toxicity, bone loss, body fat changes) can be delayed or avoided altogether. The clinical&#xD;
      data on novel combinations is currently limited but rapidly growing and has included several&#xD;
      combinations that have utilized darunavir. This study will be the first of its kind using the&#xD;
      unique combination of darunavir/cobicistat and rilpivirine. Currently, this drug combination&#xD;
      is not a recommended option for first time treatment of HIV&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IV, 48-week, open-label, pilot study in 30 ARV-naïve patients examining the&#xD;
      safety, viral response, and tolerability of darunavir/cobicistat in combination with&#xD;
      rilpivirine once daily for the treatment of HIV in treatment-naïve patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty subjects meeting the inclusion criteria for study will be selected at a single site.&#xD;
      All 30 subjects will receive darunavir/cobicistat 800/150mg in combination with rilpivirine&#xD;
      25 mg once daily at study onset and will be followed for 48 weeks after starting study&#xD;
      medications. Virologic failure will be defined as failure to achieve HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL&#xD;
      by week 24 of therapy, or in patients with baseline HIV-1 RNA &gt;100,000 copies/mL, failure to&#xD;
      achieve 1 log10 reduction in HIV-1 RNA by week 24. Confirmed virologic failure will be&#xD;
      defined as two consecutive HIV RNA levels ≥50 copies/mL after suppression to &lt;50 copies/mL&#xD;
      for two consecutive measurements. Patients with confirmed virologic failure will be&#xD;
      discontinued from the study and switched to a new antiretroviral treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have decided to initiate treatment after consultation with their physician and&#xD;
      after careful review of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) guidelines for&#xD;
      treatment will be considered for enrollment as research subjects. Individuals considered for&#xD;
      enrollment providing informed consent (See Appendix A) will be screened and, if eligible,&#xD;
      enrolled in the study. Adherence to study regimen and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions&#xD;
      will be monitored by self-report at each study visit. Adherence will be assessed using the&#xD;
      standard ACTG Adherence Questionnaire II (See Appendix B), either over the telephone or&#xD;
      during a clinic visit. Those patients reporting problems with adherence will be counseled and&#xD;
      monitored closely every 4 weeks at clinic visits with phone consultation bi-weekly until&#xD;
      adherence improves. If despite counseling, adherence is not maintained, patients will be&#xD;
      discontinued from the study due to increased risk of drug resistance. AEs will be monitored&#xD;
      closely to determine if appropriate management affects tolerability and adherence, i.e.,&#xD;
      prescribing anti-emetic or anti-diarrhea medications for nausea and diarrhea, respectively.&#xD;
      Patients will be counseled on the importance of adherence at every study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hematology, blood chemistry, liver function tests, virologic and immunologic measurements&#xD;
      will be obtained at baseline (week 0), weeks 4, 12, 24, 36, and 48. In addition to blood&#xD;
      chemistry evaluations, fasting blood samples will be obtained at baseline and weeks 24 and 48&#xD;
      for triglycerides, total cholesterol, direct HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. Pancreatic&#xD;
      amylase and serum lipase levels will be determined if serum amylase results are &gt;2x ULN (see&#xD;
      Section 5.4.2 Laboratory Evaluations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a subset of 12 subjects at their baseline and with at least 24 weeks exposure to darunavir&#xD;
      and rilpivirine a lumbar puncture will be performed to obtain a sample of CSF for viral load,&#xD;
      cell count and darunavir and rilpivirine concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence counseling will be performed after each HIV-1 RNA measurement of &gt;400 copies/mL.&#xD;
      New combination therapy for HIV will be initiated upon evidence of developing resistance in&#xD;
      the face of virologic failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples for flow cytometry (including but not limited to absolute and percent CD4+ and CD8+&#xD;
      cell counts) and HIV RNA levels will be obtained at each study visit. The Roche Amplicor 1.5v&#xD;
      (LOQ= 50 copies/mL) will be used until the patient has achieved an HIV RNA level &lt; 50&#xD;
      copies/mL at which time the HIV RNA PCR (LOQ=50 copies/mL) assay will be used. It is noted&#xD;
      that no testing outside of what is specified in this protocol, will be conducted without&#xD;
      additional written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LabCorps of America Monogram Phenosense GT will be performed in all patients at baseline and&#xD;
      for all patients with confirmed virologic failure (two consecutive HIV RNA levels ≥400&#xD;
      copies/mL after suppression to &lt;400 copies/mL for two consecutive measurements). Due to test&#xD;
      reliability, HIV RNA must be ≥1000 copies/mL in order to obtain genotype. In patients with&#xD;
      HIV RNA &gt;500 but &lt;1,000 copies/mL, testing may be unsuccessful but will be up to the&#xD;
      discretion of the investigator. Genotypes will be utilized for use in clinical&#xD;
      management.12subjects at their baseline and with at least 24 weeks exposure to darunavir and&#xD;
      rilpivirine will have a sample of CSF for viral load, cell count and darunavir and&#xD;
      rilpivirine concentration to be performed by LabCorps of America and by the University of&#xD;
      California, San Diego, CA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of facial lipoatrophy, central adiposity, breast hypertrophy, dorsal fat pad&#xD;
      (&quot;buffalo hump&quot;), multiple lipomas, and Cushingoid appearance without Cushing's disease will&#xD;
      be performed by physician assessment and self-report at baseline, weeks 24, 48, and at&#xD;
      premature discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who develop a study drug-related Grade 1 or 2 AE or clinical laboratory abnormality&#xD;
      may elect to continue study medications. Patients who develop a study drug-related Grade 3 AE&#xD;
      or clinical laboratory abnormality, with the exception of hyperglycemia,&#xD;
      hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, or Grade 3 AST/ALT elevations, may interrupt the&#xD;
      offending study medication(s) based on the discretion of the investigator. If only&#xD;
      rilpivirine is determined to be the most likely most likely cause, darunavir/cobicistat may&#xD;
      be continued for one additional week due to the long half-life of rilpivirine (~40 hours) to&#xD;
      prevent functional monotherapy. Patients who develop a study drug-related Grade 4 AE or&#xD;
      clinical laboratory abnormality, with the exception of hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia,&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia, should interrupt all study medication, regardless of half-life. Upon&#xD;
      resolution of the AE or clinical laboratory abnormality to within one grade level (not to&#xD;
      exceed Grade 2) of the patient's baseline level, the patient may resume study drug dosing&#xD;
      under the guidance of the investigator. Refer to Section 5 for more detailed information on&#xD;
      toxicity management.&#xD;
