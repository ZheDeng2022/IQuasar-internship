      Background: The level physical exercise is strongly associated with colorectal cancer risk in&#xD;
      the general population, and recent data shows that physical activity after a colorectal&#xD;
      cancer diagnosis is inversely associated with mortality risk, indication the physical&#xD;
      exercise can protect against disease progression. However, few studies have successfully&#xD;
      performed exercise interventions in patients with colorectal cancer, and the potential&#xD;
      mechanisms responsible for the tumor suppressing effects of exercise remain poorly explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: To investigate interval-walking, delivered by the InterWalk smart phone application&#xD;
      as exercise-modality in patients with colorectal cancer. Specifically it is the aim to&#xD;
      explore if InterWalk is safe and feasible as well as effective to improve cardio-metabolic&#xD;
      health profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Colorectal cancer patients, stage I-III, who are at least one month post-surgery&#xD;
      and have concluded any adjuvant chemotherapy treatment, are eligible for inclusion. Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria are: age &lt;18; any major surgical procedure planned within 6 months after inclusion;&#xD;
      pregnancy; ongoing treatment for any known malignancy; performance status &gt; 1; unable to read&#xD;
      and understand Danish&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 40 colorectal cancer patients are included and randomized to I) InterWalk or II)&#xD;
      waiting list control for 24 weeks. Patients are evaluated at baseline, week 12 and week 24 by&#xD;
      assessment measures to determine cardio-metabolic health profile and other relevant study&#xD;
      outcomes, including: cardiopulmonary exercise test (VO2peak); anthropometrics; blood&#xD;
      pressure; resting heart rate; body composition; health related quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaires; plasma concentration levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, insulin, glucose&#xD;
      and inflammatory cytokines; insulin sensitivity; and cognitive function.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION More than 30.000 individuals are living with a colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosis&#xD;
      in Denmark today. Due to marked advances in surgical and medical treatment, as well as novel&#xD;
      screening programs, this number is expected to increase over the coming years. Numerous&#xD;
      studies have shown that physical activity is inversely associated with colorectal cancer&#xD;
      risk. A meta-analysis of 52 studies found that regular participation in physical activity&#xD;
      reduced disease risk by 24% (HR: 0.76 , 95%Confidence Interval [95%CI]: 0.72 - 0.81). Recent&#xD;
      evidence furthermore shows that physical activity after a CRC diagnosis is a strong&#xD;
      independent predictor for overall survival, CRC-specific survival, and survival after disease&#xD;
      relapse. CRC patients who adhere to the current recommendation of at least 150 min moderate&#xD;
      intensity physical activity per week have an estimated 10-40% lower CRC-specific and 20-50%&#xD;
      lower overall mortality risk in comparison to sedentary counterparts. The causative&#xD;
      mechanisms responsible for this protective effect are not fully elucidated, but several&#xD;
      studies have shown that metabolic health factors, i.e. overweight/adiposity, systemic levels&#xD;
      of glucose, insulin, Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF)-1, leptin, adiponectin and inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines (TNF-Î±, CRP) are associated with CRC prognosis. These factors are, under normal&#xD;
      circumstances modifiable through physical activity and exercise, which may constitute a&#xD;
      plausible mode of action, through which, exercise may reduce risk of disease progression as&#xD;
      well as development and/or progression of cardio-metabolic co-morbid disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND Over the last decade, more than 70 studies have explored the capacity of physical&#xD;
      exercise to improve physiological (fitness, muscle strength, body composition) and&#xD;
      psychosocial (fatigue, depression, emotional well-being) outcomes in patients with cancer&#xD;
      during and after anti-neoplastic therapy and although CRC is among the most prevalent&#xD;
      malignancies, few exercise-trials have been performed in this patient group. The reason for&#xD;
      this notable low number of studies, relative to other common cancers in particular breast and&#xD;
      prostate cancer, may be a number of disease and treatment specific phenomena, e.g. high&#xD;
      prevalence of co-morbidities, stoma, late-effects from surgery or adjuvants therapies etc.,&#xD;
      which may complicate participation in traditional hospital-based exercise-programs, which is&#xD;
      often comprised of fitness- and strength-training. A recent meta-analysis included just 3&#xD;
      randomized trials investigating exercise in CRC patients, and found positive effects exercise&#xD;
      vs control on cardiovascular fitness; standardized mean difference: 0.59 [95%CI 0.25-0.93],&#xD;
      P&lt;0.01. A recent pilot study furthermore showed that home-based exercise improved several&#xD;
      metabolic factors including reduction in body weight, plasma insulin levels and improved&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity. Thus, these data indicate that CRC patients can improve cardio-metabolic&#xD;
      health profile by physical exercise; however, the present body of research have included a&#xD;
      total of less than 200 patients; explored various exercise-modalities, and applied&#xD;
      inconsistent and/or indirect assessment-methods. To this end, there is a remaining need for&#xD;
      high quality evidence describing effective exercise-interventions in CRC patients,&#xD;
      particularly interventions aimed to be successfully implemented in clinical practice in case&#xD;
      of positive results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interval training, as characterized by inter-changing cycles of high and low intensity&#xD;
      exercise, have long been recognized as the most effective exercise-modality to improve&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary fitness, and can furthermore induce equal or greater metabolic effects than&#xD;
      continuous exercise over longer duration. Considerable challenges exists however, when&#xD;
      performing high intensity interval exercise-training in clinical settings. This type of&#xD;
      exercise often needs to be performed on ergometer bicycles or treadmills and organized as&#xD;
      supervised, hospital-based training to ensure proper monitoring and feedback to participants&#xD;
      for optimal exercise intensity and progression, which limits the dissemination potential&#xD;
      beyond the trial period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Center for Physical Activity Research (CFAS) have performed a number of trials showing that&#xD;
      interval training can be performed as free-living interval-walking, consisting of repeating&#xD;
      cycles of 3 minutes fast walking followed by 3 minutes slow walking with significant positive&#xD;
      effects in cardio-metabolic health profile. Our studies show, that 16 weeks of&#xD;
      interval-walking improved VO2peak (+4ml /kg/min) reduced bodyweight (-4 kg) and fat mass (-3&#xD;
      kg) in patients with type 2 diabetes. Moreover, interval-walking improved plasma&#xD;
      lipid-profile, glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity, in contrast to continuous walking,&#xD;
      which was matched for training-volume and energy expenditure. In parallel with these&#xD;
      intervention-studies, a smart-phone application, called InterWalk (www.InterWalk.dk), has&#xD;
      been developed, which can deliver this training program of repeating cycles: 3 minutes fast&#xD;
      walking followed by 3 minutes slow walking. The exercise-program is based on an&#xD;
      individualized test-function with live-feedback, ensuring proper exercise-intensities&#xD;
      (walking-speed), and can simultaneously store test- and training data (exercise-time,&#xD;
      walking-speed, distance etc.) to an external server for research purposes. Preliminary data&#xD;
      shows that three months home-based interval-walking using the InterWalk-application can&#xD;
      improve fitness by ~10%. Thus, our preliminary data shows InterWalk can deliver an&#xD;
      un-supervised, yet individualized, structured and objectively monitored exercise-program&#xD;
      which can effectively improve cardio-metabolic health, and may be more applicable and&#xD;
      feasible, compared to traditional hospital-based programs in stigmatized patient groups with&#xD;
      major co-morbid complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore propose this intervention can have a great health promoting&#xD;
      potential in patients with CRC; however previous work have found considerable barriers and&#xD;
      complications associated with successful participation in exercise-programs for this patient&#xD;
      group. Thus, the investigators intend to explore whether interval-walking, delivered by the&#xD;
      InterWalk-app, is safe and feasible, and furthermore the investigatorsintend to explore if&#xD;
      the intervention can cause similar positive effects as the investigators have seen previously&#xD;
      in other clinical populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE AND HYPOTHESES Based on promising results from studies in type 2 diabetes, it is the&#xD;
      primary purpose of this study to investigate interval-walking via InterWalk-app as health&#xD;
      promoting exercise-intervention in patients with CRC. Specifically it is the aim of this&#xD;
      pilot study to determine the safety, feasibility, adherence and compliance of InterWalk; as&#xD;
      well as evaluating effects on cardio-metabolic health profile, compared to a waiting-list&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH PLAN This is a prospective, randomized controlled pilot-study in 40 CRC patients.&#xD;
      The study is a collaboration between Center for Physical Activity Research, Rigshospitalet,&#xD;
      Institut for Folkesundhedsvidenskab, Copenhagen University, Oncology Clinic, Rigshospitalet,&#xD;
      Abdominalcenter K, Bispebjerg Hospital, Gastroenheden Hvidovre Hospital, and&#xD;
      Patientforeningen for TarmkrÃ¦ft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and Randomization CRC patients will be recruited from the oncology clinic,&#xD;
      Rigshospitalet and the gastro-intestinal surgical ward at Hvidovre Hospital. Patients, who&#xD;
      have undergone adjuvant chemotherapy, will be informed of the study during their final visit&#xD;
      at the oncology clinic. Patients in active surveillance will be informed of the study at the&#xD;
      first clinical visit, at least one month after surgery. The responsible clinicians and nurses&#xD;
      in the clinical department will present patients with the written information of the study&#xD;
      and gather contact information for interested participants to the study coordinator for more&#xD;
      information of the study. Before any study related test-procedures are initiated, patients&#xD;
      will sign informed consent, and undergo medical screening including former and present&#xD;
      medication, physical examination including resting EKG by a study physician to determine if&#xD;
      the patient can be included in the trial and subsequently scheduled for baseline assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following baseline-assessment patients will be allocated to one of two experimental arms I)&#xD;
      InterWalk or II) waiting-list control. To account for potential bias, patients will be&#xD;
      stratified by prior treatment (adjuvant chemotherapy/no adjuvant chemotherapy), which may&#xD;
      have significant impact on study outcomes. A random allocation sequence of treatment&#xD;
      assignments for each stratification group will be created by the trial biostatistician and&#xD;
      concealed from the study personal. The study coordinator will inform the patient of the&#xD;
      treatment assignment and the patient will remain in this group for the full study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Outcomes and Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test procedures involve a number of assessments which will be conducted 3 times during&#xD;
      the study; at baseline, week 12 and week 24:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Body composition by DXA scan&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Fasting blood sample for analyses of plasma biochemistry (cholesterol, triglycerides,&#xD;
           inflammatory markers, HbA1C)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) with repeated measures of plasma glucose, insulin and&#xD;
           c-peptide&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Health related Quality of Life questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Cognitive function&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Cardio Pulmonary Exercise Test (VO2peak)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Considerations The primary analysis will compare difference in changes in study&#xD;
      outcomes from 0 to 12 weeks between the two treatment arms InterWalk vs control. For the&#xD;
      primary outcome, VO2peak, assuming a standard deviation of 2 ml/kg/min, 16 patients in each&#xD;
      group will provide 80% power to detect a between group difference of +2 ml/kg/min in. To&#xD;
      account for a potential attrition-rate of up to 20%, 20 patients will be included in each&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis is performed as a random effect model using study outcomes as dependent&#xD;
      variables, the covariates &quot;group&quot;, &quot;time&quot; and their interaction as fixed effects, and a&#xD;
      random effect of &quot;patient&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dropouts and Missing Observations Patients who wish to drop-out of the study during the&#xD;
      intervention-periods will be offered to remain in the study with regard to test-assessments.&#xD;
      All analyses are performed as 'intention-to-treat' analyses, thus all patients will remain in&#xD;
      the originally allocated treatment arms regardless of compliance to the intervention.&#xD;
      Potential drop-outs and missing observations are handled by the &quot;missing at random&quot;&#xD;
      principle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations This study, as described, is expected to include limited risks,&#xD;
      adverse effects and discomfort for subjects. During all assessment procedures, a medical&#xD;
      doctor will be present in case of discomfort or other medical problems. Should patients&#xD;
      report discomfort or adverse reactions during interval-walking, the study coordinator in&#xD;
      collaboration with the responsible clinicians, will determine if the programs needs to be&#xD;
      adapted or terminated.&#xD;

    <description>Body weight and anthropometrics (height, waist and hip circumference) will be assessed using standard procedures. Resting heart rate and blood pressure (Microlife, BPA100) will be determined in a supine position. Body composition (fat mass, bone mass and fat-free mass) and bone mineral density are analyzed by whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan (Lunar, Lunar Corporation Madison, Wisconsin, USA). Transverse scans at 1 cm intervals are made from head to toe measuring the absorption of x-ray beams at two different energy levels as these are sent through the body. Since the different chemical compounds in the body absorb the intensity of the X-rays differently, the scan allows for a valid determination of bone mass, fat mass and fat-free/bone-free mass</description>
