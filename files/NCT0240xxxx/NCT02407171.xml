  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part prospective trial examining the ability of Stereotactic Body Radiation&#xD;
      Therapy (SBRT) to induce a response to MK-3475, a humanized antibody to PD-1, in patients who&#xD;
      progress on this antibody. Patients with metastatic melanoma will be enrolled after they have&#xD;
      progressed on anti-PD-1 therapy. Patients with metastatic NSCLC (previously untreated with&#xD;
      anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy) will be enrolled and treated with MK-3475 until they exhibit&#xD;
      progression of disease. At this point (when patients have demonstrated progression of&#xD;
      disease) a single target lesion will be selected and treated with SBRT, and then MK-3475 will&#xD;
      be restarted and continued until there is further progression of disease. The first phase of&#xD;
      the study is a radiation dose escalation with a constant dose of MK-3475. The second part of&#xD;
      the study includes expansion cohorts of NSCLC and melanoma patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The phase 1b portion of the trial is a radiation dose escalation study to determine the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SBRT when given to patients previously and subsequently&#xD;
      exposed to MK-3475. Because the class of PD-1 inhibitory antibodies conveys a risk of&#xD;
      pneumonitis, there will be two parallel dose escalation arms- Arm A will include SBRT targets&#xD;
      in the lung parenchyma, and Arm B will be limited to targets outside the lung parenchyma.&#xD;
      Each arm will be separately escalated, and two MTDs will be determined. The starting dose&#xD;
      will be 3000 cGy in 5 fractions; there will be one dose escalation cohort (3000 cGy in 3&#xD;
      fractions), and if necessary one dose de-escalation cohort (1000 cGy in a single fraction).&#xD;
      If there is dose-limiting toxicity at the lowest cohort, that arm will be closed and SBRT to&#xD;
      that site will be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase 2a portion of the study includes 2 expansion cohorts, for melanoma and NSCLC, with&#xD;
      SBRT delivered at the MTD. The primary endpoint of this phase of the study is the overall&#xD;
      response rate to post-SBRT MK-3475. Secondary endpoints include determining the time to&#xD;
      progression, overall survival, and exploratory biomarkers.&#xD;
