  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn how CGT9486 (fka PLX9486) may affect&#xD;
      cancer cells with certain mutations in the KIT gene, specifically in participants with types&#xD;
      of advanced solid tumors including gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CGT9486 (fka PLX9486) is designed to block KIT gene mutations. These mutations can cause&#xD;
      cancer and cancer cell growth. By blocking these mutations, the drug may kill the cancer&#xD;
      cells with the mutation and/or stop the tumor from growing. By combining CGT9486 (fka&#xD;
      PLX9486) with PLX3397 and CGT9486 (fka PLX9486) with sunitinib, the investigators hope to&#xD;
      block most KIT gene mutations that drive cancer growth.&#xD;

      This study includes a dose escalation portion (Part 1) in which the safety profile and&#xD;
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of PLX9486 as a single oral agent will be evaluated in&#xD;
      participants with solid tumors (including GIST), followed by signal-seeking extension cohorts&#xD;
      (Part 2). Enrollment in the combination treatment portions of the study (dose-finding for the&#xD;
      PLX9486 + pexidartinib combination [Part 2b] and the PLX9486 + sunitinib combination [Part&#xD;
      2e]) was planned to be accrued using standard 3+3 study designs. Parts 2a, 2c, 2d, and 2f&#xD;
      were not conducted due to business decisions.&#xD;
