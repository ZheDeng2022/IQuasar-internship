      The purpose of this protocol is to investigate, using functional magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (fMRI), the effect of treatment with lorcaserin on centers of the brain that control appetite&#xD;
      and food intake, as well as lorcaserin's downstream metabolic effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to investigate the effect of treatment with the study drug,&#xD;
      called lorcaserin on centers of the brain that control appetite and food intake, as well as&#xD;
      lorcaserin's other metabolic effects. Lorcaserin's effect on the brain will be investigated&#xD;
      using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Lorcaserin was approved in June 2012 as&#xD;
      an addition to a reduced-calorie diet and exercise, for chronic weight management. Previous&#xD;
      weight loss drugs, such as fenfluramine, acted throughout the body and caused heart problems.&#xD;
      Lorcaserin is different because it only acts on receptors (sites of action) that are found in&#xD;
      the brain and does not act on the heart, and thus, has not been shown to cause the heart&#xD;
      problems seen in the past.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine the effects of the study drug lorcaserin, on the brain, and its impact on&#xD;
           food visualization (high fat and low fat images) and interaction with satiety (by&#xD;
           measuring during the fasting or fed states) using fMRI. (Satiety is defined as when a&#xD;
           person has had enough or too much food and does not want to eat any more, as after&#xD;
           finishing a satisfying meal.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine the satiety and weight-reducing effect of lorcaserin using physiological&#xD;
           measurements (such as how much weight is lost and how this may affect hormone levels),&#xD;
           and its association with changes in fMRI responses and neuropsychological performance.&#xD;
           To examine whether the long-term weight reducing effects of lorcaserin can be predicted&#xD;
           by early food visualization.&#xD;

    <description>Changes in body composition will be assessed by the following measurements:&#xD;
DEXA (Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry): Body composition and bone density will be measured by DEXA. For the DEXA test, the subject will be lying on an examination bed for about 25 minutes. A small part of the DEXA machine will be recording and moving back and forth about 3 feet above their body. The radiation the subject will get is very small and is much less than what one gets from a regular chest X-Ray.&#xD;
Anthropometry: Anthropometry will be performed by a licensed dietician. Measurements include: Height, Weight, umbilical and smallest waist, broadest and iliac hip measurements.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Metabolic Rate (Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR): RMR is the amount of calories the subject burn without doing any physical work. The subject's RMR will be measured with a commonly used instrument. The subject will be asked to lie quietly in bed and stay awake with a large plastic hood over the subject's head and upper body for about 20 minutes. The subject will breathe normally while the air they breathe out is collected and analyzed.</description>

        Additionally, women participants must use double barrier methods to prevent pregnancy&#xD;
        (diaphragm with intravaginal spermicide, cervical cap, male or female condom with&#xD;
        spermicide). If a woman suspects that she has become pregnant at any time or does not use&#xD;
        one of the contraceptive methods recommended by the investigator, she must notify the study&#xD;
        staff. If a woman becomes pregnant, she will be withdrawn from the study. The study staff&#xD;
        will follow the progress of her pregnancy and the birth of her child.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects using any other weight loss products (orlistat, phentermine, topiramate,&#xD;
             fenfluramine, dexfenfluramine, amphetamines, GLP-1 agonists) or use within 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Women who are breastfeeding, pregnant, or wanting to become pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Women using IUD (intrauterine device)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any change in the dosage of hormonal contraceptive medications (birth control pills,&#xD;
