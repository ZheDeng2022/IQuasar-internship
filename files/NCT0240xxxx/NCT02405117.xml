      This study will develop and pilot a smartphone intervention, LiveWell, to enhance patient&#xD;
      self-management of bipolar disorder and facilitate more efficient, timely care delivery by&#xD;
      mental health providers. The intervention uses a mobile application to collect daily&#xD;
      self-report and continuous behavioral data and adapts intervention content to create a highly&#xD;
      tailored and user-responsive treatment system. Patient data collected by the phone will also&#xD;
      be provided to clinicians to allow for better evaluation and targeting of treatment. The goal&#xD;
      is to reduce symptoms and prevent relapse in patients with bipolar disorder.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder is a severe and chronic mental illness that significantly increases&#xD;
      mortality and greatly impairs functioning. Despite the use of pharmacological treatments,&#xD;
      multiple acute episodes, long episode duration, and significant inter-episode sub-syndromal&#xD;
      symptoms are common in patients with bipolar disorder. As a result, patients with bipolar&#xD;
      disorder are symptomatically ill about half the time. There is clear evidence that the&#xD;
      addition of psychotherapeutic interventions to medication management improves treatment&#xD;
      outcomes, yet only about half of bipolar patients receive combined treatment. Current&#xD;
      therapies also have limitations in terms of: 1) reliance on subjective patient self report&#xD;
      and 2) difficulties in identifying warning signs of impending episodes. Furthermore, direct&#xD;
      measurement of observable daily patterns of behavior is not routinely available, even though&#xD;
      alterations in sleep and activity are core symptoms of bipolar disorder. Improving access to&#xD;
      and long-term engagement in psychosocial interventions is needed to substantially improve&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are developing a smartphone intervention that aims to make proven&#xD;
      psychosocial interventions for bipolar disorder more readily and routinely accessible to&#xD;
      patients as part of their day-to-day lives. The intervention, called LiveWell, will capture&#xD;
      and feedback data about sleep and activity to assist patients in regularizing daily rhythms&#xD;
      as well as help them monitor, recognize, and manage early warning signs of impending mood&#xD;
      episodes. Behavioral and self-report data collected by the phone will also be used to provide&#xD;
      clinicians with information regarding patient clinical status. This will increase&#xD;
      patient-provider communication and allow for better evaluation and targeting of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the study will last 4 months. All participants will first undergo initial&#xD;
      assessments that will include a telephone interview and a face-to-face interview with a&#xD;
      certified study psychiatrist for the purpose of confirming diagnosis. Eligible participants&#xD;
      will then be assigned randomly to the LiveWell or TAU group. Participants assigned to either&#xD;
      group will be provided with a smartphone and wrist-worn device, and will be asked to carry&#xD;
      the phones with them whenever they leave home and to wear the wrist-worn devices 24-hours a&#xD;
      day 7 days a week. Participants assigned to the LiveWell intervention will be asked to&#xD;
      undergo a 16 week psychosocial intervention consisting of phone-based self-monitoring and&#xD;
      educational tools to help them learn skills to better manage symptoms. Participants assigned&#xD;
      to the TAU group will be asked to provide limited self-report data on wellness and sleep. All&#xD;
      participants, regardless of assigned group, will be asked to participate in assessments&#xD;
      delivered over the phone to assess presence and severity of mood symptoms.&#xD;
