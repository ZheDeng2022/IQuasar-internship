    <textblock>
      The use of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) represents a major advance for&#xD;
      hematological patients, enabling the effective delivery of chemotherapy and/or blood products&#xD;
      particularly for prolonged infusions or in situation of difficult venous access. In modern&#xD;
      medical practice their use has increased rapidly for several reasons, including ease of&#xD;
      insertion, many uses (e.g., drug administration and venous access), perceived safety, and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness compared with centrally inserted central catheters (CICCs).&#xD;

      The use of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) represents a major advance for&#xD;
      hematological patients, enabling the effective delivery of chemotherapy and/or blood products&#xD;
      particularly for prolonged infusions or in situation of difficult venous access. In modern&#xD;
      medical practice their use has increased rapidly for several reasons, including ease of&#xD;
      insertion, many uses (e.g., drug administration and venous access), perceived safety, and&#xD;
      costeffectiveness compared with centrally inserted central catheters (CICCs). Despite these&#xD;
      benefits, PICCs are associated with deep vein thrombosis of the arm and pulmonary embolism.&#xD;
      These complications, which are often called venous thromboembolism, are important because&#xD;
      they not only complicate and interrupt treatment, but also increase cost, morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. Despite this effect, the burden and risk of PICC-related venous thromboembolism is&#xD;
      uncertain and clinicians have scarce evidence on which to base choice of vascular access.&#xD;
      Evidence to choose one vascular access over the other is lacking in literature, in particular&#xD;
      for patients affected by haematological malignancies, in which chemotherapy is more likely to&#xD;
      cause myelosuppression, with a major risk of bloodstream infections. Furthermore, the precise&#xD;
      incidence and the risk of PICC-related venous thromboembolism relative to that of other CICCs&#xD;
      is unknown. An understanding of this risk in the context of growing PICC use is an important&#xD;
      cost and patients safety questions. Up to now, no systematic review has been done to&#xD;
      investigate these questions.&#xD;
