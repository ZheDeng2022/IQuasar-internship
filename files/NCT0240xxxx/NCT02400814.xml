    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I trial compares administration schedules of anti-programmed cell death-1&#xD;
      ligand 1 (PD-L1) monoclonal antibody MPDL3280A and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy in&#xD;
      treating patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody MPDL3280A, may block tumor growth in different ways by&#xD;
      targeting certain cells. Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy, also known as stereotactic body&#xD;
      radiation therapy, is a specialized radiation therapy that delivers a single, high dose of&#xD;
      radiation directly to the tumor and may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal&#xD;
      tissue. Giving anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody MPDL3280A with stereotactic ablative&#xD;
      radiotherapy may be a better treatment for non-small cell lung cancer. However, it is not yet&#xD;
      known what the best administration schedule is for these treatments.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine which administration schedule of MPDL3280A (anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      MPDL3280A) and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SAR) will be most promising to move&#xD;
      forward to a phase II trial based on safety and objective response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To define the safety and toxicity profile of MPDL3280A plus SAR using Common Terminology&#xD;
      Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4 (v4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Radiographic response rates by immure-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid&#xD;
      Tumors (irRECIST).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Progression free survival using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)&#xD;
      1.1 and irRECIST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Conduct correlative immunologic endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I (CONCURRENT COHORT): Patients receive anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody MPDL3280A&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning on day 1 of course 1, patients&#xD;
      also undergo SAR 2-3 times per week (with a minimum of 40 hours and a maximum of 96 hours&#xD;
      between fractions) over 1.5-2 weeks for a total of 5 fractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II (INDUCTION COHORT): Patients receive anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody MPDL3280A IV over&#xD;
      30-60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Beginning on day 1 of course 3, patients also undergo SAR 2-3 times&#xD;
      per week (with a minimum of 40 hours and a maximum of 96 hours between fractions) over 1.5-2&#xD;
      weeks for a total of 5 fractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM III (SEQUENTIAL COHORT): Patients undergo SAR 2-3 times per week (with a minimum of 40&#xD;
      hours and a maximum of 96 hours between fractions) over 1.5-2 weeks for a total of 5&#xD;
      fractions beginning on day 1 of course 1. After completion of SAR (beginning on day 1 of&#xD;
      course 2), patients receive anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody MPDL3280A IV over 30-60 minutes on&#xD;
      day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;
