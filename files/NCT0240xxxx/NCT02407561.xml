    <textblock>
      Patients with locally advanced rectal and esophageal carcinomas typically undergo neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemoradiation therapy prior to surgical resection. While response rates to this treatment&#xD;
      differ among these three cancers, generally 20-25% of patients exhibit minimal or no response&#xD;
      to preoperative chemoradiation therapy while 20-30% exhibit a complete pathologic response,&#xD;
      and the remainder receiving a partial response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a multi-center study of patients with newly diagnosed rectal adenocarcinoma, or&#xD;
      anal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) who will undergo neoadjuvant chemoradiation prior to&#xD;
      surgery. The tumor from these patients will be tested to determine whether response to&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemoradiation can be accurately predicted.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients with locally advanced rectal and esophageal carcinomas typically undergo neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemoradiation therapy prior to surgical resection, although the specific chemoradiation&#xD;
      regimens may vary. While response rates differ among these three cancers, generally 20-25% of&#xD;
      patients exhibit minimal or no response to preoperative chemoradiation therapy while 20-30%&#xD;
      exhibit a complete pathologic response, and the remainder receiving a partial response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In esophageal adenocarcinoma, patients who achieve a complete response tend to have a&#xD;
      significantly longer overall survival than those who do not achieve a complete response.&#xD;
      Similar data exists for rectal cancer that the degree of responsiveness to chemoradiation&#xD;
      regimens dictates survival outcome in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients with distinct response profiles can be identified before treatment starts,&#xD;
      personalized regimens can be delivered to maximize the benefit in each patient population:&#xD;
      complete responders may be spared post-treatment surgical resection, while non responders may&#xD;
      consider avoiding ineffective chemoradiation prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with newly diagnosed rectal adenocarcinoma, or anal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)&#xD;
      who will undergo neoadjuvant chemoradiation prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      350 patient samples will be included in this validation study, given the predicted 25%&#xD;
      population size that exhibit pathologic complete response (pathCR) to pre-operative&#xD;
      chemo/radiation therapy, and the predicted 25% population size that have no response (exCTRT)&#xD;
      to pre-operative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a multi-center prospective study of up to 350 patients, each having both&#xD;
      pre-treatment (prior to chemoradiation) unstained sections on charged slides from the FFPE&#xD;
      block that was used for diagnosis of rectal or anal cancer and sections of unstained,&#xD;
      post-surgical, resected tissue (pathologic confirmation of treatment response based upon&#xD;
      endoscopy or ultrasound can be accepted in place of post-surgical resected tissue). Per the&#xD;
      CLIA-compliant SOPs (Appendix A), one slide will be stained with H&amp;E to define the area of&#xD;
      tumor within the tissue, and the remaining slides will be used for immunohistochemical (IHC)&#xD;
      detection of the biomarkers described above to assess the performance of the proprietary IHC&#xD;
      assay. Any remaining slides not used for IHC staining will be used for a parallel gene&#xD;
      expression discovery effort using TaqMan high throughput RT-PCR analysis (Appendix B,&#xD;
      Sub-study 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proprietary assay will be performed under CLIA certified standard operating procedures.&#xD;
      The individual assay results, treatment effect, actual survival data, and other clinical data&#xD;
      will be analyzed. Initial labeling index data will be used to develop a training set and&#xD;
      unique algorithmic approach specifically applicable to rectal and anal carcinoma. The&#xD;
      remaining samples will be embargoed for use as an independent test set.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Associated clinical data will be collected :&#xD;
