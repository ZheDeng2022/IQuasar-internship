      The objectives of this trial are to assess the effects of hemp product consumption,&#xD;
      specifically hulled hemp seeds and hemp oil on blood fatty acid profiles and cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease risk factors, in healthy overweight volunteers after 4 weeks of consumption.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will be a 4 week double-blinded, randomized, cross-over design with 2 treatment&#xD;
      intervention (hemp and control) periods separated by a 4 week washout period. Thirty&#xD;
      metabolically healthy overweight volunteers will be recruited into the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 1, and 27, 28 of each treatment period participants will be asked to come to the&#xD;
      Richardson Center for Functional Foods and Nutraceuticals (RCFFN) for a 12 hour fasted blood&#xD;
      sample. On day 1, participants will be given prepackaged sachets of treatment hulled seeds&#xD;
      (hemp or sesame) and salad dressing, containing 30 g/d of treatment (hemp or soybean) oil (in&#xD;
      individually packaged daily containers) will also be supplied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed by clinical coordinators to integrate the products (2 sachets&#xD;
      of seeds, 1 salad dressing) into their daily meals and to avoid other dietary sources of n-3&#xD;
      fatty acids, such as flax, chia, camelina, krill and fish products. Participants will be&#xD;
      given activity monitors to wear during the intervention periods. Participants will be&#xD;
      required to eat one sachet of hulled seeds in the morning and one in the evening, and to&#xD;
      consume the dressing throughout the day, for each 4 week treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to continue their habitual diets, while avoiding large dietary&#xD;
      sources of n-3 fatty acids, throughout the treatment and washout periods. Participants will&#xD;
      be instructed to maintain the same level of physical activity and alcohol intake throughout&#xD;
      the trial period. The trial coordinator will contact participants weekly via telephone or&#xD;
      email to monitor treatment adherence and to answer any questions or concerns participants&#xD;
      might have. Background dietary intakes will be measured at day 1 of the trial using a food&#xD;
      frequency questionnaire, and during each treatment period by 3-day food record to be&#xD;
      completed in the last week of each treatment period. Participants will be asked questions&#xD;
      about the interventions including side effects, mood and perceived energy level by trial&#xD;
      coordinators at the end of each intervention period.&#xD;
