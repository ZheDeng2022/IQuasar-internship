      This study is a longitudinal controlled trial that is designed to investigate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a multi-component intervention on improving fruit and vegetable consumption&#xD;
      in teenagers and their mothers. Participants will be allocated in three groups with a) an&#xD;
      intervention group in which mothers and children receive the intervention and questionnaires,&#xD;
      b) only the children receive the intervention and mothers and children receive the&#xD;
      questionnaires, and c) mothers and children are in active control group and only receive the&#xD;
      questionnaires. The intervention package contains behavior change techniques targeting&#xD;
      outcome expectancy, self-efficacy, action planning, coping planning, and self-monitoring. The&#xD;
      active control group receives an information sheet regarding recommendations on fruit and&#xD;
      vegetable intake. There will be 3 assessment points in time, with 1 months in between. All&#xD;
      the intervention materials and information sheets will be handed to participants after the&#xD;
      baseline assessment. The self-monitoring calendar will be collected at time 2 assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of this study is to estimate the dyadic mechanisms between mothers and&#xD;
      their children regarding improving fruit and vegetable intake. Secondary outcome is to&#xD;
      investigate whether fruit and vegetable consumption did improve in the intervention groups in&#xD;
      general and also to find the psychological mechanism behind the changes during the time of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
