  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mental disorders are common in youth and adults. Symptoms of mental are aggravated by&#xD;
      unemployment. Compared to the working population, the unemployed have higher rates of poor&#xD;
      health, a tendency toward negative emotionality and depression, show symptoms of exhaustion&#xD;
      more frequently, and experience disturbed sleep or have a sleep disorder. It can be&#xD;
      reasonably expected that unemployment in adolescents and young adults causes the same&#xD;
      symptoms and behaviors as in adults. In those youth with a mental disorder, particularly an&#xD;
      untreated one, the transfer from school to the employment market can be hindered. At the same&#xD;
      time, the investigators notice an increase in early disability pensions due to mental health&#xD;
      issues among adolescents. Thus, the early recognition and treatment of mental disorders and&#xD;
      psychological strain is crucial in promoting the employment of young people and supporting&#xD;
      their connection to the employment market.With this project the investigators want to&#xD;
      implement an early intervention and reach out to unemployed youth. The investigators&#xD;
      identified the period between graduation and first employment as the ideal moment of&#xD;
      intervention, because this time period is a critical period in which young people are exposed&#xD;
      to increasing personal challenges. Conducting an intervention before a psychological stress&#xD;
      transforms into a mental disorder, can prevent harm and suffering to the afflicted person. In&#xD;
      addition, early intervention could help prevent the need to enroll in the early disability&#xD;
      pension program.&#xD;

      Mental disorders are common. A WHO study shows (Gore, Bloem, Ferguson, Coffey and Mathers,&#xD;
      2011) that during adolescence; most of the years lost because of illness are due to&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, substance abuse and schizophrenia.&#xD;
      Steinhausen, Metzke and Kannenberg (1998) found that 22% of the children and adolescents&#xD;
      living in the canton of Zurich, suffer from mental disorders. The figures are comparable with&#xD;
      Wittchen, Nelson and Lachner (1998) who fund 27% of the adolescents fitting the DSM IV&#xD;
      (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual) criteria for mental disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mental disorders are particularly stressful in combination with unemployment. Unemployed are&#xD;
      often in a worse physical condition compared to employed people; they tend to negative&#xD;
      emotional states and depression, fatigue and sleep disorders. It is to be expected that&#xD;
      unemployment will have the same effect on adolescents. Fergusson, Horwood and Lynskey (1997)&#xD;
      showed that in 16 to 25 years old, the increase of the unemployment was correlated with the&#xD;
      increase of mental distress having consequences like depression, anxiety, substance abuse and&#xD;
      attempts to suicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to validate a screening tool for the early recognition of mental&#xD;
      disorders among young unemployed. The screening tool will be composed by no more than 50&#xD;
      items.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be requested to fill out the screening tool and in a second phase, they&#xD;
      will be asked to participate in a face to face, standardized clinical Interview, the&#xD;
      Munich-Composite International Diagnostic Interview (M-CIDI) (Wittchen, Lachner, Wunderlich&#xD;
      and Pfister, 1998).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure that the screening tool differentiates between 'at risk' and 'non at risk'&#xD;
      patients, the sample will be composed by 40 unemployed young adults, Age 16-25 and 40 working&#xD;
      young adults, age 16-25.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: After the data collection the data from the screening and the clinical&#xD;
      interview will be tested for sensitivity and specificity. To evaluate both the Receiver&#xD;
      Operating Characteristic (ROC) and other methods will be used. The prognostic validity of the&#xD;
      screening tool will be additionally calculated with a logistic regression. The data analysis&#xD;
      will be executed with SPSS 21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing data will be excluded from the sample.&#xD;
