    <textblock>
      In this randomized, usual therapy-controlled study, 62 patients with fibromyalgi (FM) were&#xD;
      recruited with a ratio of 1:1. Trained and guided by Eight Brocades (EB) certified&#xD;
      physicians, participant practiced EB one hour, twice a week for 12 weeks. Evaluation will be&#xD;
      based on standard scales of pain, FM symptoms severity, degree of fatigue, depression, sleep&#xD;
      quality and quality of life.&#xD;

      The EB, also written as Ba Duan Jin, or Baduanjin, or Eight-Section Brocade, is a set of&#xD;
      Qigong exercises that originated in China and date back thousands of years. It is a mind-body&#xD;
      practice that combines meditation with slow, gentle, graceful movements, as well as deep&#xD;
      breathing and relaxation, to move vital energy (or qi) throughout the body and is practiced&#xD;
      as a rehabilitation exercise for various kinds of diseases. It is considered a complex,&#xD;
      multicomponent intervention that integrates physical, psychosocial, emotional, spiritual, and&#xD;
      behavioral elements. Participants in the EB group received a modified EB adapted by Chinese&#xD;
      Medicine Master Zhi-zheng Lu, which was added several joint exercise movements to the&#xD;
      traditional EB forms to specifically tailor it for patients with rheumatic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FM is a common and complex clinical syndrome characterized by chronic and widespread&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and physical and psychological impairment.&#xD;
      Evidence-based guidelines suggest that exercise is beneficial for FM and has been advocated&#xD;
      as a core component of its treatment. Because of EB's mind-body attributes and it is easy to&#xD;
      learn, we assume that it could be well suited for the treatment of FM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in this trial will be randomly allocated into one of two groups: EB group&#xD;
      and usual therapy-controlled group. Patients will be evaluated at baseline, at week 4, 8 and&#xD;
      12. The primary outcome measure was a Visual Analogue Scales for pain (PVAS). Secondary&#xD;
      outcome measures included the following: the Revised FM Impact Questionnaire (FIQR), the&#xD;
      Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue (MAF), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the&#xD;
      Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and the Tender Points&#xD;
      Count (TPC).&#xD;
