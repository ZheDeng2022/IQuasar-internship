  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will have a diagnosis of both pancreatic adenocarcinoma and cachexia&#xD;
      defined as greater than 5% unintentional weight loss within 6 months prior to screening&#xD;
      visit. Patients must be greater than 18 years of age; and have greater than 3 months life&#xD;
      expectancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will observe a standard of care intervention (tube feeding) for potential benefit.&#xD;
      Peptamen will be administered through a jejunal or a gastrojejunal feeding tube and dosing&#xD;
      will be calculated using the Mifflin St. Jeor equation. It will be administered daily for the&#xD;
      duration of the protocol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we will prospectively evaluate advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients&#xD;
      with cachexia, who are receiving enteral feeding, with a peptide based diet (medical food),&#xD;
      through a jejunal or gastrojejunal feeding tube. We plan to collect serum samples routinely&#xD;
      and establish a cohort of patients with this clinical syndrome. Our aims are to establish the&#xD;
      feasibility and efficacy of enteral nutrition and its relationship to meaningful clinical&#xD;
      outcomes. Furthermore, we will assess for a correlation between cachexia, activity, and&#xD;
      patient reported outcomes on domains of quality of life in an optional activity tracker&#xD;
      sub-study.&#xD;
