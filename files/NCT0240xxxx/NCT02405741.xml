      Trial protocol V2.0 - Hyperbaric chamber treatment to CRVO patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assaf HaRofe Medical Center - Zerifin, Israel&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: To determine whether hyperbaric chamber treatment improves the functionality and&#xD;
      symptoms related to CRVO&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO) has profound effects on retinal circulation. As this&#xD;
      vein collects the entire venous outflow from the retina, retinal perfusion is greatly&#xD;
      impaired when it occludes. Even though, as compensation, the collateral outflow is expanded&#xD;
      but nevertheless there is an increase in retinal venous pressure, venous dilation, retinal&#xD;
      hemorrhage and retinal edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduction of blood flow leads to retinal hypoxia and upregulation of vascular endothelial&#xD;
      growth factor (VGEF )&#xD;
&#xD;
      In CRVO there is a variable degree of capillary nonperfusion visible on fluorescein&#xD;
      angiography (FA) which is divided into &quot;ischemic&quot; and &quot;non ischemic&quot; depending on the size of&#xD;
      the area of non perfusion on FA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible complications of CRVO include chronic cystoid macular edema (CME),&#xD;
      neovascularization of retina, neovascular glaucoma and vitreous hemorrhage. These&#xD;
      complications are serious, sight threatening, and require prolonged treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current therapy of CRVO requires different treatment modalities depending on the&#xD;
      complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neovascularization is treated mainly by laser photocoagulation (PRP - pan retinal&#xD;
      photocoagulation) and VEGF inhibitors. Photocoagulation is based on lowering the oxygen&#xD;
      consumption of peripheral retina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Macular edema is treated with anti VEGF and/or steroidal injections. Most patients require&#xD;
      continuous monthly injections which may last for years in order to dehydrate their macula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent clinical trials such as CRUISE and BRAVO have shown that the immediate monthly&#xD;
      injections of anti VEGF (Ranibizumab) during the first 6 months and then later as needed&#xD;
      decreased substantially the time to achieve visual acuity gain following CRVO5. In BRAVO&#xD;
      trial the cumulative proportion of patients who had gained 15 letters or more from baseline&#xD;
      by 12 month (from CRVO incidence) was 50% (sham), 68% (ranibizumab 0.3 mg), and 71%&#xD;
      (ranibizumab 0.5 mg) and in CRUISE trial 42%, 61%, and 66%, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another trial which evaluated the effect of anti VEGF was the COPERNICUS trial in which&#xD;
      patients with CRVO received intravitreal aflibercept injection every 4 weeks up to 6 months&#xD;
      following the CRVO. The control group received sham injections and the proportion of patients&#xD;
      gaining â‰¥ 15 letters was 56.1% versus 12.3% (P&lt;0.001) at week 24. Improved reduction in&#xD;
      central retinal thickness and increased vitreous hemorrhage as the major side effect (up to&#xD;
      6.8%) was also evident in patients treated with aflibercept.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although effective, these anti VEGF injections expose the patient to many possible side&#xD;
      effects including sub conjunctival hemorrhage and transient hypertension at the mild end of&#xD;
      the spectrum or endophthalmitis and lens injury at the severe end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative treatment is the use of steroids such as dexamethasone intravitreal implant&#xD;
      (Ozurdex). However, this treatment may induce side effects such as increased ocular pressure,&#xD;
      cataract, allergy, conjunctival hemorrhage and eye pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoxic induction of cytokines, such as VEGF, play a central role in CRVO and its&#xD;
      consequences such as retinal edema and iris neovascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperbaric chamber has the potential to increase oxygen perfusion and perhaps decrease&#xD;
      retinal hypoxia, thereby decreasing the induction of cytokines and improving retinal&#xD;
      functionality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' broad experience in hyperbaric chamber treatment reveals that it is a&#xD;
      rather benign treatment compared to the alternatives where the most relevant side effect in&#xD;
      eligible patients is usually ear barotrauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigative Device:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperbaric chamber assists in increasing the amount of oxygen in the plasma and in the&#xD;
      tissues and has been proven to be beneficial in treating different ischemic wounds, and acute&#xD;
      retinal artery occlusion (ARAO) but its effect hasn't been tested in CRVO patients yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with chronic CRVO who are receiving monthly injections of Bevacizumab treatment for&#xD;
      at least 12 months will be recruited. Upon recruitment each patient will undergo a screening&#xD;
      Ophthalmologic examination including visual acuity, refraction and OCT. This will be followed&#xD;
      by a series of 40 daily hyperbaric chamber treatments. A repeated ophthalmic examination will&#xD;
      be done after 20 and 40 hyperbaric sessions.&#xD;
