      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Vasculitis is a group of diseases that inflame and damage blood vessels and tissue. It can&#xD;
      cause many medical problems. Few tests can diagnose the disease, and none can reliably&#xD;
      predict a relapse. Researchers want to study people s genes and follow people over time to&#xD;
      see how the disease affects them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To learn the signs, symptoms, imaging tests, genetic markers, and blood tests that can help&#xD;
      identify people with vasculitis and predict what will happen to them over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People age 3 and older who have or are thought to have vasculitis, or are related to&#xD;
           someone with it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be evaluated by a doctor who has expertise caring for patients with&#xD;
           vasculitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will give a blood sample. Some will give a urine sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some participants may have brushings or biopsies taken from the inside lining of the&#xD;
           nose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Images of participants blood vessels may be taken using scans. For some scans,&#xD;
           participants will lie on a table that moves in and out of a cylinder that takes&#xD;
           pictures. For some scans, a contrast agent may be injected into an arm vein. Other scans&#xD;
           may use a radioactive form of sugar. Healthy minors will not have scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some participants will answer questionnaires. - Some participants will have their tests&#xD;
           done at NIH. Others will have their doctor take the blood, saliva, or cheek swab samples&#xD;
           and send them to NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some participants will have one visit lasting 1-2 (but sometimes up to 4) days. Some&#xD;
           participants may have follow-up visits every 3 - 6 months, indefinitely.&#xD;

      The purpose of this protocol is to study the natural history of idiopathic systemic&#xD;
      vasculitis in children and adults. The idiopathic vasculitides are a group of rare, systemic&#xD;
      diseases involving inflammation of arteries and other tissue with resulting organ- and&#xD;
      life-threatening disease courses. The different forms of idiopathic vasculitis are typically&#xD;
      classified based upon the predominant size of the arteries affected in each condition,&#xD;
      including small vessel vasculitis [granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA, Wegener s),&#xD;
      microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA,&#xD;
      Churg-Strauss)]; medium vessel vasculitis [polyarteritis nodosa (PAN)]; and large vessel&#xD;
      vasculitis [giant cell arteritis (GCA), Takayasu s arteritis (TAK), idiopathic aortitis&#xD;
      (IA)]. Although patients with each type of vasculitis manifest disease-specific aspects of&#xD;
      illness, there are substantial disease and treatment burdens common to patients with&#xD;
      vasculitis. For each type of idiopathic vasculitis, the disease course is often chronic,&#xD;
      relapse is common and unpredictable, organ and tissue damage can accrue over time, new&#xD;
      symptoms can occur late into the disease course, and treatment is often associated with&#xD;
      toxicity and serious side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of this natural history protocol are to establish a cohort of pediatric and adult&#xD;
      patients with vasculitis to prospectively evaluate the signs and symptoms, imaging findings,&#xD;
      and blood and tissue biomarkers associated with pathogenesis and disease outcomes. In the&#xD;
      small vessel vasculitides, where considerable progress has been made towards identifying&#xD;
      pathologic mechanisms of disease, we will focus on elucidating the pathogenic role of&#xD;
      neutrophils, selected biomarkers such as SERPINA1, and novel candidate biomarkers in&#xD;
      circulating blood and at local tissue sites including the nasal mucosa. In the medium and&#xD;
      large vessel vasculitides, we will identify novel candidate biomarkers for disease&#xD;
      pathogenesis and outcomes and develop disease activity indices that incorporate existing and&#xD;
      novel clinical, laboratory, genomic, and imaging biomarkers. For all types of vasculitis, a&#xD;
      goal of the protocol is to identify patients for possible entry into future treatment&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in this protocol will undergo a history, physical examination, and&#xD;
      laboratory evaluation. Since vasculitis is multi-system disease with variable patterns of&#xD;
      organ involvement, patients may undergo further comprehensive evaluation of a particular&#xD;
      affected organ system when clinically indicated. Peripheral blood samples will be collected&#xD;
      from affected patients, unrelated healthy volunteers matched for age, sex, and ethnicity&#xD;
      whenever possible, and in some cases unaffected family members to help identify and study the&#xD;
      genes involved in vasculitis and their functions. We may ask some patients to undergo nasal&#xD;
      biopsy and additional imaging studies for research purposes. For a small number of patients&#xD;
      and family members, we may ask permission to perform whole genome or exome sequencing.&#xD;
      Successful completion of these studies will improve our understanding of disease&#xD;
      pathogenesis.&#xD;
