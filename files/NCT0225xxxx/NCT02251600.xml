      Study to characterize the single-state and steady-state dosing of oral deflazacort in&#xD;
      pediatric and adolescents subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single period study in 24 male DMD subjects consisting of children&#xD;
      (ages 4-12, inclusive) and adolescents (ages 13-16, inclusive) with at least 12 subjects&#xD;
      between the ages of 4-12 (children). Subjects taking maintenance corticosteroid therapy will&#xD;
      be required to take their dose of corticosteroid 24 hours (± 2 hours) prior to the first dose&#xD;
      of deflazacort on Day 1. Subjects receiving deflazacort as maintenance corticosteroid therapy&#xD;
      must take their last dose at least 30 days prior to the first dose of deflazacort on Day 1.&#xD;
      Concomitant corticosteroid therapy will be prohibited during the study while the subject is&#xD;
      taking deflazacort. On Day 1, a single oral dose of deflazacort under fasting conditions will&#xD;
      be administered in the CRU followed by blood sampling for plasma analysis of DFZ and&#xD;
      21-desacetyl-DFZ for 8 hours. Following the 8 hour PK sample on Day 1, subjects will be given&#xD;
      medication to take at home for once-daily, morning dosing on Days 2 through 7 (+2 days). On&#xD;
      Day 8 (+2 days), subjects will return for a PK sample predose and an 8th oral dose of&#xD;
      deflazacort under fasting conditions which will be administered in the CRU followed by PK&#xD;
      sampling for 8 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be monitored throughout the study by repeated clinical and laboratory evaluations&#xD;
      on Days 1 and 8 (+2 days). Subjects will be contacted via telephone approximately 7 days (± 1&#xD;
      day) following study drug administration on Day 8 (+2 days) for a follow-up assessment to&#xD;
      determine if any adverse event (AE) has occurred since the last study visit. Subjects who&#xD;
      terminate the study early will be contacted if the Principal Investigator (PI) deems&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects that complete this study or receive at least one dose of study medication will be&#xD;
      eligible for an open-label extension study with deflazacort treatment conducted under a&#xD;
      separate protocol.&#xD;
