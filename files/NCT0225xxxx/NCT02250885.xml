&#xD;
               -  Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) or poorly differentiated gastroenteropancreatic&#xD;
                  neuroendocrine tumor (GEP-NET)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Poorly differentiated metastatic neuroendocrine tumors of unknown primary origin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease: Any primary and/or metastatic mass reproducibly measurable in one&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Objective evidence of tumor progression within 4 months prior to study entry, as&#xD;
             defined by serial cat scan (CT) per RECIST 1.1 criteria. (At least a 20% increase in&#xD;
             the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition, the sum must also demonstrate an&#xD;
             absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also&#xD;
             considered progression).&#xD;

             surgery, chemotherapy, hepatic embolization/ chemoembolization or radioactive isotopes&#xD;
             (i.e. Yttrium 90). In any case, disease progression must be documented after&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant octreotide treatment for carcinoid syndrome is allowed for patients whose&#xD;
             tumor has progressed while on octreotide. Patients must have been on a stable dose of&#xD;

             times the upper limit of normal (ULN; 1.0 mg/dL) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)&#xD;
             &lt;2.5 times ULN (30 U/L). In the case of known (radiological and/or biopsy documented)&#xD;
             liver metastasis, ALT &lt;5.0 times ULN is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate renal function within 7 days prior to C1D1: estimated creatinine clearance of&#xD;
             ≥ 30 mL/min, calculated using the formula of Cockcroft and Gault: (140-Age) • Mass&#xD;
             (kg)/(72 • creatinine mg/dL); multiply by 0.85 if female.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood electrolytes should be within the following normal limits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Bicarbonate (total) 18-30 mEq/L Sodium 135-147 mEq/L Potassium 3.5-5.5 mEq/L Phosphorus&#xD;

             patch, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicidal gel, or a sexual partner who is&#xD;
             surgically sterilized or post-menopausal. For both male and female patients, effective&#xD;
             methods of contraception must be used throughout the study and for three months&#xD;
