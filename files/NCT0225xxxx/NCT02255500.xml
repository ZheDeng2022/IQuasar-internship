    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of EXPAREL in&#xD;
      subjects who undergo femoral nerve block with bupivacaine HCl for unilateral total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty (TKA).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On Day 1, eligible subjects will receive a single 20 mL dose of bupivacaine hydrochloride&#xD;
      (HCl) 0.5% with epinephrine 1:200,000 within 2 hours prior to the surgical procedure as an&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided femoral nerve block (FNB). EXPAREL 266 mg expanded to 60 mL with&#xD;
      preservative-free sterile normal saline will be infiltrated into the surgical site prior to&#xD;
      wound closure. There will be no local coadministration of the two drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for bupivacaine pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis will be obtained from subjects at&#xD;
      baseline (prior to bupivacaine HCl administration for nerve block), 15 minutes, 30 minutes,&#xD;
      and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours after the beginning of EXPAREL administration,&#xD;
      and on Day 14.&#xD;

&#xD;
         12. Any clinically significant event or condition uncovered during the surgery (e.g.,&#xD;
             excessive bleeding, acute sepsis) that might render the subject medically unstable or&#xD;
             complicate the subject's postsurgical course.&#xD;
