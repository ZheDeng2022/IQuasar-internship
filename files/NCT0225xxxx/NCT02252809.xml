  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to characterize the biological responses elicited by&#xD;
      endotoxin inhalation applied to healthy subjects, and to assess the effect of standard&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory agents (i.e. adalimumab and methylprednisolone) on these biological&#xD;
      responses.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This open-label, single-center, parallel-group clinical trial is designed to evaluate Humira®&#xD;
      or methylprednisolone versus no treatment in healthy subjects applied inhaled endotoxin&#xD;
      challenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 30 healthy adult subjects who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the following cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1 subjects receive no study drug during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2 subjects receive an oral 7-day course of the corticosteroid&#xD;
           (methylprednisolone) during the study, starting on study Day 1. The daily dose is 20 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3 subjects receive a single subcutaneous injection of the anti-tumor necrosis&#xD;
           factor (TNF) (adalimumab) on study Day 1, administered as a 40 mg dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include a Screening period of up to 21 days, during which subject eligibility&#xD;
      will be assessed and Screening responses to endotoxin exposure challenge will be collected.&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will initially undergo an 8-day treatment period, during which they will&#xD;
      receive treatment based on their assigned cohort (or will receive no treatment if assigned to&#xD;
      Cohort 1) and will be applied with the endotoxin challenges. After the treatment period,&#xD;
      subjects will be followed up until study Day 42.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy evaluations will include specific responses to endotoxin challenge, and effects of&#xD;
      methylprednisolone and adalimumab on these responses. Safety will be monitored throughout the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
