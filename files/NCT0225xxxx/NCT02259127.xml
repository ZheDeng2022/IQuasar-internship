    <textblock>
      A new anti-HIV medicine (Dolutegravir) combined with 2 currently used anti-HIV medicines is&#xD;
      non-inferior to the standard combination of medicines used in terms of efficacy and better in&#xD;
      terms of toxicity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ODYSSEY study is an ongoing international randomised trial evaluating dolutegravir based&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy versus standard of care in HIV-infected children aged less than 18&#xD;
      years who are starting first line treatment (ODYSSEY A) or switching to second line treatment&#xD;
      (ODYSSEY B). Participants have visits 4 weeks and 12 weeks after randomisation and every 12&#xD;
      weeks subsequent of that. They are followed up for a minimum of 96 weeks. The primary&#xD;
      objective of the study is to assess the difference in virological or clinical failure by 96&#xD;
      weeks between children receiving a DTG-based regimen and those on standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of study visit for the randomised phase, children and carers will be invited to&#xD;
      consent to extended follow-up. Children's visit schedules and care will be as per local&#xD;
      clinic guidelines. Participants will be followed up until May 2023 in this phase of the&#xD;
      trial. The objectives of the extended follow-up are two-fold: 1. to provide safety data for&#xD;
      ViiV Healthcare for participants who, in the opinion of the treating physician, continue to&#xD;
      derive benefit from dolutegravir and receive dolutegravir from ViiV Healthcare where it is&#xD;
      not available through their country's national HIV treatment programme; 2. to monitor&#xD;
      long-term safety and effectiveness of dolutegravir versus standard of care.&#xD;
