      Through the National Registry of patients with ACS in the IMSS (RENASCA IMSS) the&#xD;
      investigators will know the real world in terms of risk factors frequency, clinical&#xD;
      presentation and its complications, and in the end they can build a risk model for early&#xD;
      Major Cardiovascular Events (MACE).&#xD;

      Introduction: Ischemic heart diseases as the leading cause of death in Mexico are mainly due&#xD;
      to acute myocardial infarction. In this sense, reperfusion strategies are the cornerstone of&#xD;
      treatment to reduce complications and costs; however, less than 50 percent of patients&#xD;
      receive this treatment as a third of the world's population dies by this cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The World Health Organization (WHO) predicts for the next two decades about 23.5 million&#xD;
      deaths worldwide by cardiovascular diseases. Particularly Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)&#xD;
      caused in 2008 about seven million deaths worldwide. It is estimated that each year in Mexico&#xD;
      around 300 thousand people suffer an ACS, at least 60 percent of these is caused by&#xD;
      Myocardial Infarction (MI) but there are not real numbers for morbidity nor real clinical&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efforts have been made in Mexican registries of ACS as shown in the first real world study&#xD;
      done in the IMSS which serves the greater number of these cases (54.4 percent) called&#xD;
      &quot;National Registry of Acute Coronary Syndromes&quot; (RENASCA IMSS). In this registry 10 tertiary&#xD;
      care hospitals participated enrolling 2,398 patients with ACS diagnosis, most of them with&#xD;
      ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI), representing 63 percent; the average age was 62&#xD;
      years. In 65 percent of cases stratified as high risk (GRACE&gt; 150 points), only 42 percent&#xD;
      were treated with fibrinolytic therapy, 8 percent with primary Percutaneous Coronary&#xD;
      Intervention (PCI) and the remaining 50 percent did not receive any reperfusion therapy which&#xD;
      is the cornerstone for the prognosis of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently Mexico is experiencing an increase in the elderly population and in the frequency&#xD;
      of traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis associated with factors such as overweight&#xD;
      and obesity which has become a high-risk population group for ischemic heart diseases and its&#xD;
      complications. It represents a challenge to the health system from the point of view of&#xD;
      prevention in the beginning but also in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment goals in traditional risk factors have not been accomplished yet. Patients are&#xD;
      diagnosed late and there is not a risk model in our population since more than 50 percent of&#xD;
      patients do not receive adequate treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore it is necessary to have a current outlook of what is happening in the mexican&#xD;
      population through a National Registry of patients with ACS in the IMSS (RENASCA IMSS). This&#xD;
      will allow to know the real world in terms of risk factors frequency, clinical presentation&#xD;
      and its complications, and in the end a risk model can be built.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE: To develop a risk model for early Major Cardiovascular Events (MACE) in patients&#xD;
      with Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) based on the IMSS National Registry of Acute Coronary&#xD;
      Syndromes (RENASCA IMSS.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Consecutive patients of any gender between 18 and 90 years old,&#xD;
      diagnosed with Acute Coronary Syndrome (STEMI/ NSTEMI/ Unstable angina - according to&#xD;
      international diagnostic criteria - American College of Cardiology (ACC) / American Heart&#xD;
      Association (AHA) / European society of Cardiology (ESC), attended in representative&#xD;
      hospitals of tertiary care in the IMSS will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design is an analytical consecutive prospective multicenter study with an emerging cohort&#xD;
      of patients with ACS through a National Registry in units of tertiary care in the IMSS&#xD;
      (RENASCA IMSS). Follow-up will be done during hospitalization and 30 days, time of most Major&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Events presentation (MACE) derived from the timing of initial treatment or&#xD;
      lack of it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MACE to evaluate during Follow-up will be: Reinfarction, myocardial ischemia, heart failure,&#xD;
      electrocardiographic complications and / or death (mortality). 8 tertiary care hospitals or&#xD;
      Medical Units of High Specialty (UMAES for its acronym in Spanish) will participated&#xD;
      representing the country: an analysis of clinical and paraclinical variables contained in the&#xD;
      record considered as relevant in predicting the inception cohort for MACE during&#xD;
      hospitalization and 30 days will be done. The cohort of major cardiovascular events (as&#xD;
      previously defined) will be compared with the cohort comprised by patients without such&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be done with central tendency and dispersion measures according to&#xD;
      the distribution of the variables. We will use the hypothesis testing according to the&#xD;
      normality of data with T-test for independent groups or Mann-Whitney test for continuous&#xD;
      variables, whereas for categorical variables X2 test or Fisher exact test when the observed&#xD;
      frequency is &lt;5 will be used. The free event will be analyzed with Kaplan Meier curves. To&#xD;
      determine the correlation of performers (blind and independent) of angiography and&#xD;
      echocardiography we will use the Kappa index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of the risk model will be performed with logistic regression which dependent&#xD;
      variable is the presence of MACE during hospitalization and 30 days (Wald method, backward).&#xD;
      Variables for clinical and epidemiological history considered as relevant will be included,&#xD;
      according also with the biological and epidemiological consistency and plausibility. The&#xD;
      statistical criteria will be the inclusion of variables that in the bivariate analysis show p&#xD;
      &lt;0.20 and the exit criteria of the model will be pâ‰¥0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The discriminative power of the model will be done with the area under the Receiver Operating&#xD;
      Characteristic curve (ROC curve). The calibration will be done with the Hosmer-Lemeshow test.&#xD;
      Relative risk with confidence intervals of 95 percent will be calculated. All hypothesis&#xD;
      tests will be done under an alpha level of &lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TIME OF DEVELOPMENT: Two years.&#xD;
