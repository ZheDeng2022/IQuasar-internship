      The number of intervention performed for metastatic breast cancer has dramatically increased&#xD;
      over the past 2 decades. Hepatectomy and pulmonary resection for stage IV colorectal cancer&#xD;
      is now considered the standard of care for resectable patients with isolated hepatic and/or&#xD;
      pulmonary disease and acceptable performance status. However, the indications for resection /&#xD;
      intervention of breast cancer origin metastases are not as clearly defined. The aim of this&#xD;
      study to focus on emerging data for the intervention (resection and/or radiofrequency&#xD;
      ablation (RFA), transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), cyberKnife stereotactic&#xD;
      radiosurgery) of breast cancer metastatic disease to the lung and liver, with a focus on&#xD;
      indications for resection / intervention.&#xD;

      Purpose Despite breast cancer being the most common cancer in women in the developed world,&#xD;
      only a minority of patients (&lt; 10%) has stage IV disease at diagnosis (1). In addition,&#xD;
      20-30% of patients with early breast cancer will experience distant metastatic relapse (2).&#xD;
      Due to advances in available multimodality therapies and a better understanding of tumor&#xD;
      biology, survival of stage IV patients is constantly improving (3-5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically, oligometastatic breast cancer is characterized by solitary/few detectable&#xD;
      lesions, usually limited to single organs, in which local therapy with curative intent could&#xD;
      impact survival. This population of 'potentially curable' stage IV disease is estimated to be&#xD;
      1-10% of newly diagnosed patients with metastatic breast cancer (5). A multimodal approach is&#xD;
      endorsed for these selected patients (5,6). The identification of patients with truly&#xD;
      oligometastatic disease is challenging. Most published series refer to an era before modern&#xD;
      imaging (i.e. positron emission tomography-computed tomography), and thus many patients were&#xD;
      probably understaged, potentially leading to underestimation of the global effect of an&#xD;
      aggressive local management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with oligometastatic disease can be divided into 3 cohorts (7,8): 1) patients who&#xD;
      present with oligometastases; 2) patients with residual oligometastases after systemic&#xD;
      therapy; and 3) those with relapsed oligometastases after curative locoregional therapy.&#xD;
      These different groups have possibly distinct prognoses, and may need differential&#xD;
      approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several series have reported on lung and liver metastases resection in oligometastatic breast&#xD;
      cancer and most data are from small series of patients collected over many years. The largest&#xD;
      dataset comes from the International Registry of Lung Metastases and presents results of lung&#xD;
      metastasectomy in 467 breast cancer patients (9). Complete resection was possible in 84% of&#xD;
      patients and led to a median survival of 37 months (5-year OS = 38%, 10-year OS = 22%).&#xD;
      Identified prognostic factors for lung resection include disease-free interval and number of&#xD;
      metastases (disease-free interval &gt;36 months and solitary metastases being the most&#xD;
      favorable), ER status, size of metastases, completeness of resection, and use of anatomical&#xD;
      resection (as opposite to wedge resection) (9-19). Obviously, the reported data refer to a&#xD;
      subset of patients who were selected for favorable prognostic factors, and any comparison&#xD;
      with surgically untreated patients is threatened by serious biases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary resection in metastatic breast cancer patients, apart from its potential&#xD;
      therapeutic value, is also an important diagnostic tool, especially in patients with a&#xD;
      suspected first recurrence, allowing for differential diagnosis with second primary lung&#xD;
      cancers and benign lesions (19,20). The proportion of lesions proved not to be breast cancer&#xD;
      metastases in various series ranges from 7% to 66% (9,14,18,21). As the morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality of pulmonary resection has decreased substantially over the last decades, this&#xD;
      potentially beneficial procedure can be discussed in a selected group of patients (9,19,21).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery to remove liver metastases is an accepted treatment modality in patients with&#xD;
      colorectal cancer (22). Its role in breast cancer is, however, much less recognized. Liver is&#xD;
      a common metastatic breast cancer site, but only 5% of patients have isolated liver&#xD;
      involvement. In various series of hepatic resection for breast cancer metastases, the&#xD;
      reported median survival ranged from 14.5 to 63 months and the 5-year survival from 14% to&#xD;
      61%, in general, comparing well with nonsurgically treated patients. Most of the reported&#xD;
      series, however, describe extremely selected patients, constituting 1% or less of metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer patients treated over the respective periods of time (22-26). As an example, in&#xD;
      the one of the important series, all patients were asymptomatic and identified through&#xD;
      intensive surveillance programs (27). Patients with isolated liver metastasis can potentially&#xD;
      be managed with local treatments (surgery, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), transcatheter&#xD;
      arterial chemoembolization (TACE), cyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery). In contrast to&#xD;
      liver colorectal metastases, local treatment for breast cancer liver metastasis is not&#xD;
      considered a therapeutic option due to common involvement of additional organs; nevertheless,&#xD;
      in some selected patients, local approaches have been associated with long-term survival&#xD;
      (10,29,30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because patients who are potentially eligible for this therapeutic strategy represent only&#xD;
      1%-3% of the total metastatic breast cancer population, a large global collaboration is&#xD;
      needed to confirm its impact on long-term survival or cure and to ensure adequate statistical&#xD;
      power and strength of the results. Enrolled patients must have comparable clinical and&#xD;
      biological characteristics, extent of staging, and frequency of monitoring to avoid selection&#xD;
      biases and stage migration, which can substantially affect the outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of intervention performed for metastatic breast cancer has dramatically increased&#xD;
      over the past 2 decades. Hepatectomy and pulmonary resection for stage IV colorectal cancer&#xD;
      is now considered the standard of care for resectable patients with isolated hepatic and/or&#xD;
      pulmonary disease and acceptable performance status. However, the indications for resection /&#xD;
      intervention of breast cancer origin metastases are not as clearly defined. The aim of this&#xD;
      study to focus on emerging data for the intervention (resection and/or radiofrequency&#xD;
      ablation (RFA), transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), cyberKnife stereotactic&#xD;
      radiosurgery) of breast cancer metastatic disease to the lung and liver, with a focus on&#xD;
      indications for resection / intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient acquisition and data collection All patient should be female. All following&#xD;
      demographic, clinical and tumour specific data will be collected: patient age, performance&#xD;
      status according to the WHO classification at the time of first presentation to the hospital,&#xD;
      stage, type and receptor status (ER, PR, HER-2) of the primary tumour, tumor load in the lung&#xD;
      and/or liver (uni-or bilateral affection, number of metastases, diameter of the largest&#xD;
      tumour size), chronology of the metastases (metachronous or synchronous), presence of further&#xD;
      metastatic (synchronous metastases) or recurrent (metachronous) extrahepatic tumour growth&#xD;
      and lymph node involvement in the mediastinal region or hepatoduodenal ligament. In addition,&#xD;
      treatment-related and follow-up data will be documented: Intervention method (surgical&#xD;
      resection, cryosurgery, laser-induced thermotherapy, radio-frequency ablation, ethanol&#xD;
      injection, cyber-knife), median follow-up, incidence of tumour recurrence, time to&#xD;
      recurrence, overall survival, and the administration of chemotherapy. Survival will be&#xD;
      calculated from the date of diagnosis of the lung and/or liver metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions Lung and/or liver metastases will be defined as metachronous if the interval&#xD;
      between resection of the primary tumour and first diagnosis of metastases is longer than 3&#xD;
      months. General physical condition of study patients will be measured by the performance&#xD;
      status according to the WHO classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior and during the treatment, all patients will be undergone evaluation with complete&#xD;
      medical history, physical examination, baseline blood tests, and imaging evaluations&#xD;
      (positron emission tomography (PET-CT) and/or radiography, bone scintigraphy, computed&#xD;
      tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasonography). Effects of the treatment will&#xD;
      be monitoring by imaging analyses at every 3 months for lesions detected at diagnosis of lung&#xD;
      and/or hepatic metastasis or every 6 months without detectable lesions before the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      R0 resection is a complete resection with no microscopic residual tumor, while R1 resection&#xD;
      means a complete resection with no grossly visual tumor as defined by surgeon, but&#xD;
      microscopic cancer may be left behind. R2 resection indicates a partial resection with&#xD;
      grossly visible tumor left behind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effects of the treatment were assessed by analyses of maximum response, according to either&#xD;
      the criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO) (30) or the Response Evaluation Criteria&#xD;
      in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0 (31) since its announcement in 2004. Responses in bone&#xD;
      metastases were evaluated using the methods reported by MD Anderson Cancer Center (32,33),&#xD;
      with CR as clear evidence of complete bone recalcification with attainment of near-normal&#xD;
      bone architecture or normalization of scan, and partial response as radio- logical evidence&#xD;
      of sclerosis in lytic lesions or marked improvement of bone scan. In recent years, MRI was&#xD;
      performed when available, and the imaging information was taken into account in evaluation of&#xD;
      bone metastases. Responses in pleural fluids were determined as: CR for radiological&#xD;
      demonstration of complete disappearance of pleural fluid, and PR for 50% or more decrease.&#xD;
      For study inclusion, pathological diagnosis of the primary lesions had to be obtained,&#xD;
      whereas tissue or cellular pathology of the metastatic lesions was preferred but not&#xD;
      mandatory. In patients who performed surgical resection, a complete histopathological&#xD;
      response will be defined as the absence of vital tumour cells. Detection of tumour necrosis&#xD;
      or scar formation within the tumour tissue will be regarded as a partial pathohistological&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics committee approval in Istanbul University Istanbul Medical Faculty can be obtained to&#xD;
      participate for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The characteristics of the patients with assessable data will be&#xD;
      compared with X2 test or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Overall survival (OS) will be defined as&#xD;
      duration from diagnosis of the metastasis to last visit or death. Progression free interval&#xD;
      (PFI) will be defined as duration from diagnosis of the metastasis to the point when disease&#xD;
      progression will be detected. Complete response (CR) will be achieved by a systemic therapy&#xD;
      or no evidence of clinical disease (NED) after a local therapy considered relapse-free, and&#xD;
      the duration between induction of relapse free status and the point of relapse detection will&#xD;
      be defined as the relapse free interval (RFI); survival time after induction of relapse-free&#xD;
      status without relapse will be defined as relapse free survival (RFS). Unrelated death other&#xD;
      than from breast cancer will be considered as censored in evaluation of PFI and RFI. Survival&#xD;
      curves will be calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method. The log-rank test will be&#xD;
      used to evaluate differences in survival between groups with intervention and&#xD;
      no-intervention. A multivariate analysis will be performed by Cox regression and the&#xD;
      following variables will be included: age, DFI, performance status (PS), liver metastasis,&#xD;
      pulmonary metastasis, presence of other metastasis, hormone receptor status, HER2 status,&#xD;
      Ki-67 status, intrinsic subtype, administration of local therapy, and chemotherapy regimens.&#xD;
      Statistical significance will be defined as a p value &lt;0.05. All p values will be calculated&#xD;
      for two-sided analyses. For observed survival, all deaths will be considered as events&#xD;
      including patients who died from secondary causes without recurrence. Statistical analyses&#xD;
      will be performed using SPSS 22.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL) software.&#xD;
