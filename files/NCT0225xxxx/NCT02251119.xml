    <textblock>
      The objective of the study was to determine if the co-administration of loperamide (LOP) with&#xD;
      tipranavir (TPV), ritonavir (RTV), or TPV plus RTV (TPV/r) caused a clinically significant&#xD;
      change in the respiratory response to carbon dioxide (CO2), defined as a 10% decrease in the&#xD;
      area under the pharmacodynamic effect/time curve or at least a 25% decrease in at least one&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic time point.&#xD;

&#xD;
         16. Hypersensitivity to TPV, RTV, or LOP&#xD;
