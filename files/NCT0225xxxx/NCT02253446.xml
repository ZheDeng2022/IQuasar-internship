  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Currently, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are widely used by emergency physicians&#xD;
           in Turkey for the treatment of patients with Primary Dysmenorrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The objective of the study is compare intramuscular Diclofenac sodium and piroxicam's&#xD;
           pain reduction dysmenorrhea in emergency department (ED) adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators second aim was to compare recurrent dysmenorrhea pain within 24 hours&#xD;
           after discharge.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      -  this is the randomized double blinded clinical trial to compare the efficacy of these&#xD;
           two drugs in this clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A randomized clinical trial was conducted in the ED of Pamukkale University Medical&#xD;
           Faculty Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study personnel (emergency physicians and nurses) were trained before the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When intramuscular drugs (Piroxicam, Diclofenac sodium) was being recommended, an&#xD;
           eligibility checklist was completed by the attending physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If there were no exclusion criteria, written informed consent was obtained and baseline&#xD;
           information, including initial Dysmenorrhea pain severity ratings with VAS were&#xD;
           recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The need for identification and enrollment of participants by staff with conflicting&#xD;
           work pressures resulted in recruitment of a convenience sample of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients eligible for the study were randomized to one of two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First Group: 20 mg of piroxicam (feldene ampoule -Pfizer-France) intramuscularly (IM)&#xD;
           was given 200 patients,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Second Group: Diclofenac sodium 75mg (Miyadren drug-ampoule -Yavuz Istanbul)&#xD;
           intramuscularly (IM) was given 200 patients which determined to be applied as a group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drug packs prepared in 5 ml syringes were numbered by an independent nurse, who not&#xD;
           involved in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drugs were prepared according to the computer-generated random number sequence to assign&#xD;
           treatment allocations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The allocation list was kept by the emergency nurse. Patients received the piroxicam,&#xD;
           diclofenac sodium medication schemes according to their random allocations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After enrollment and recording of baseline information, the next numbered study drug&#xD;
           pack was obtained, and administered as a intramuscular.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomization was achieved by using computer software to generate random numbers. During&#xD;
           the intervention, participants were monitored by an oxygen saturation (SpO2) monitor, an&#xD;
           automatic sphygmomanometer (blood pressure), and a rhythm monitor (heart rate and&#xD;
           rhythms)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One researcher blinded to patient allocation observed the whole procedure and recorded&#xD;
           the Dysmenorrhea pain scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients in both groups received two types of medication in a similar manner, thus&#xD;
           ensuring double blinding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dysmenorrhea pain scores were recorded at 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 min on a VAS of 1 to 10&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rescue medication (100 mg of tramadol hydrochloride) was given intramuscular to patients&#xD;
           if pain VAS scores ≥ 5 in forty five minutes after study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All other medications required during the study also were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the study, pulse rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure,&#xD;
           respiration rate and oxygen saturation (SpO2) were recorded at baseline (0 min), 15, 30,&#xD;
           and 60 min.&#xD;
