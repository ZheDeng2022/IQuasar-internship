  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized control trial study is to determine if an active&#xD;
      rehabilitation (low intensity exercise program) in combination with a comprehensive education&#xD;
      intervention (standard care) is more effective than the comprehensive education intervention&#xD;
      alone in reducing post-concussion symptoms and improving participation in daily activities in&#xD;
      youth who have persistent post-concussion symptoms.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a portion of youth who continue to experience persistent post-concussion symptoms&#xD;
      beyond the first few weeks of injury. There is limited evidence with respect to the best ways&#xD;
      to treat persistent post-concussion symptoms in youth following concussion. There is a small&#xD;
      amount of literature that suggests active rehabilitation as a positive intervention for&#xD;
      promotion of recovery of persistent post-concussion symptoms. However, this approach to&#xD;
      rehabilitation has yet to be explored using a randomized control trial protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study aims to answer the following question: Is a 6 week active&#xD;
      rehabilitation program in combination with a comprehensive education intervention (standard&#xD;
      care) effective in reducing post-concussive symptoms and improving functional recovery&#xD;
      compared to receiving comprehensive education intervention alone among youth experiencing&#xD;
      persistent post-concussion symptoms?&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. youth ages 10 to 18 years who present with persistent self-reported post-concussion&#xD;
           symptoms 4 weeks after the initial injury and receive the active rehabilitation&#xD;
           intervention, will present with decreased post-concussion symptoms at the completion of&#xD;
           the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. youth ages 10 to 18 years who receive the active rehabilitation intervention, will&#xD;
           present with more complete functional recovery and increased participation in&#xD;
           unrestricted physical activity at the completion of the active rehabilitation&#xD;
           intervention compared to children receiving the comprehensive education intervention&#xD;
           only&#xD;
