  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the use of motivating/rewarding features in a computer based arm&#xD;
      rehabilitation program. Half of the subjects will take part, besides receiving standard&#xD;
      therapy, in a computer based program delivering a game like scenario with visual effects and&#xD;
      monetary rewards in case of successful level completion, while the other half will take part&#xD;
      in a similar program without visual effects or the possibility to earn money.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rewards not only increase motivation to train, but have also been shown to influence motor&#xD;
      skill learning via activation of dopaminergic brain structures. In goal oriented tasks,&#xD;
      receiving information about goal achievement has a rewarding value, which is further&#xD;
      increased if performance has monetary consequences. Computer games often strengthen this kind&#xD;
      of information by presenting explosions and other salient stimuli when a goal is achieved&#xD;
      (e.g. a target has been reached). The current study investigates the outcome of an arm&#xD;
      rehabilitation program, based on such a computer game delivered in two versions. Stroke&#xD;
      patients are asked to use their impaired arms to perform goal oriented movements. Movements&#xD;
      are translated into movements of a virtual arm on a computer screen. Goals are &quot;meteors&quot;,&#xD;
      threatening to destroy a planet on which they fall, if not caught by the virtual arm. One&#xD;
      version of the computer game delivers state of the art graphics including a number of visual&#xD;
      effects and, if the planet was protected successfully, information about a monetary reward,&#xD;
      whereas the other version of the program delivers schematic graphic objects only. Training&#xD;
      time and intensity are kept constant and outcome measures, including standard clinical motor&#xD;
      assessments, are compared between the groups.&#xD;
