  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is to evaluate the effectiveness of ExAblate Transcranial MRgFUS as a tool&#xD;
      for creating a unilateral lesion in the Vim thalamus or the globus pallidus (GPi) in patients&#xD;
      with treatment-refractory symptoms of movement disorders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and initial effectiveness of MRI-guided&#xD;
      focused ultrasound thermal ablation of a designated area in the brain of patients suffering&#xD;
      from movement disorder symptoms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FUS under MRI-guidance and MRI-based thermometry can be safely delivered to patients&#xD;
           suffering from treatment-refractory movement disorders through an intact human skull&#xD;
           with a low risk of transient adverse effects as evaluated during follow-up of up to&#xD;
           12-months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A pre-defined target volume inside the brain can be accurately ablated, as demonstrated&#xD;
           on post-treatment MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lesions generated with ExAblate Neuro will result in clinical effects that are similar&#xD;
           to those seen with ablative procedures using other surgical techniques (e.g. RF&#xD;
           procedure).&#xD;
