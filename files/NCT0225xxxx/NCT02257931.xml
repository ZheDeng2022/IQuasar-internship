  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A significant increase in resistant bacteria emerging in HSCT recipients. For example, 25% -&#xD;
      42% of all enterobacteriaceae produce extended spectrum beta-lactamases; 8 - 72% of&#xD;
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa are resistant to at least one and 25 - 62% to three or more antibiotic&#xD;
      classes, 13% of Gram-negative bacteria are caused by a multidrug-resistant (MDR) strain&#xD;
      (Trecarichi JI 09, Mikulska BBMT 09, Oliveira BMT 07, Caselli Haemat 10, Gudiol, JAC 11).&#xD;
      These resistant bacteria may be associated with increased mortality and have limited&#xD;
      treatment options (Caselli Haemat 10, Poutsiaka BMT 07, DiazGranadoz JID 05). To provide the&#xD;
      currently best empirical coverage and to control the growing resistance, knowledge of trends&#xD;
      in antibiotic susceptibility, as well as risk factors is essential. For this reason we&#xD;
      propose to perform non-interventional prospective multicentre study in EBMT centres.&#xD;

      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the incidence and pattern of antimicrobials resistance among Gram-negative&#xD;
      bacteria isolated from blood in HSCT patients during the first 6 months after the&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) to determine whether the currently administered empirical therapy is appropriate; 3) to&#xD;
      determine mortality associated with resistant vs. sensitive Gram-negative bacteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion of resistant pathogens among gram-negative bacterial pathogens isolated from&#xD;
      blood of HSCT recipients during the first 6 months post HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pathogens resistant to either one of the following: ceftazidime or cefepime or&#xD;
           piperacillin-tazobactam&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pathogens with carbapenem resistance (not including ertapenem)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. MDR pathogens&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The proportion of resistant Gram-negative pathogens not listed in the primary end-point&#xD;
           among Gram-negative bacterial pathogens isolated from blood of HSCT recipients during&#xD;
           the first 6 months post HSCT:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Gram-negative pathogens resistant to fluoroquinolones&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Gram-negative pathogens resistant to at least one of aminoglycosides&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Gram-negative pathogens resistant to colistin&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Gram-negative pathogens (other than Pseudomonas) resistant to tigecycline&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Acinetobacter spp. resistant to ampicillin-sulbactam&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Acinetobacter spp. resistant to tetracyclin or minocycline&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Stenotrophomonas maltophilia resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Stenotrophomonas maltophilia resistant to minocycline&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The outcome of the infections caused by resistant pathogens vs. sensitive, including&#xD;
           mortality of any cause within 7 days and within 30 days;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The appropriateness of the currently administered empirical antimicrobial therapy;&#xD;
           Inappropriate initial antimicrobial therapy will be defined as empirical antibiotic&#xD;
           regimen, given in the first 48 hours following obtaining the blood cultures, that does&#xD;
           not include at least one antibiotic that is active in vitro against the infecting&#xD;
           microorganism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on all the episodes of Gram-negative bacteria blood stream infections will be collected&#xD;
      prospectively from the initiation of the conditioning treatment until the end of the first 6&#xD;
      months after the HSCT (or death or lost follow-up, if they occur earlier).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on the patients who will develop Gram-negative infection will be reported using special&#xD;
      MED C form and include data on the pathogen and antimicrobial susceptibility of the pathogen,&#xD;
      treatment and outcome, and presence of certain risk factors, in addition to the data present&#xD;
      in MED A form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's data such as age, gender, primary diagnosis and status of the disease, presence of&#xD;
      co-morbidities, HSCT type, donor type, conditioning regimen (myeloablative versus reduced&#xD;
      intensity), GVHD prophylaxis and outcome at the time of report will be obtained from the MED&#xD;
      A form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Allogeneic or autologous HSCT recipients, of all ages, for any&#xD;
      indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Patients who are not willing to participate. Expected number of patients:&#xD;
      3650 HSCT patients to be recruited and followed in order to obtain data on 365 Gram negative&#xD;
      episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basis for calculations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assumptions&#xD;
&#xD;
      ~30% of HSCT patients will have bacteremia, about a half of them due to Gram negatives=10-15%&#xD;
      of HSCT patients. Depending on local epidemiology, about a 40% of them will be resistant to&#xD;
      at least one of the antibiotics mentioned in the primary endpoint. Mortality in resistant GN&#xD;
      bacteremia is 30-50%. Mortality in sensitive bacteremia is 5-20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical issues&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The actual sample size for the analyses will be the number N* of episodes of&#xD;
           Gram-negative bacteremia observed. These will be observed in N≤N* patients. For&#xD;
           simplicity, we will assume that one patient ↔ one episode, i.e. N=N*.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The total number of transplants that we should have in the participating centers during&#xD;
           the recruitment period in order to observe N patients with (at least) an episode of&#xD;
           Gram-negative bacteremia will be indicated by T. We will assume that N = 10% of T.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Notice thus that these scenarios are &quot;conservative&quot;, as we could expect to observe more&#xD;
           patients with an episodes than 10%, and multiple episodes per patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We considered several scenarios computing the minimum sample size necessary to obtain an&#xD;
           estimation of the incidence of resistance among Gram-negative bacteremia episodes with&#xD;
           precision equal to 0.05 (preferably) or 0.1, assuming a value between 20% and 60% for&#xD;
           the incidence. (Confidence level for the interval estimate always equal to 95%).&#xD;
           Scenarios have also been considered for secondary objectives. All calculations were done&#xD;
           using the NCSS-PASS 2000 software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T=365 transplants (N=3650 patients) is a minimum number of transplants necessary to be able&#xD;
      to get a 95%CI=(0.35,0.45) when the actual incidence of resistance is equal to 40%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection &amp; Statistical Analysis Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Center registration form will be sent to all EBMT centers before the beginning of the study.&#xD;
      It will assess their willingness to participate and provide some background information on&#xD;
      the number of transplants performed/year, names of the responsible persons, methods used by&#xD;
      laboratories, etc. All episodes of blood stream Gram-negative bacterial infections will be&#xD;
      collected prospectively since the initiation of the conditioning treatment and further on&#xD;
      during the 6 months after the transplantation. All the episodes of Gram-negative bacteremias&#xD;
      will be included, including multiple episodes in the same patient. For each episode of&#xD;
      Gram-negative bacteremia, additional information including relevant microbiological data will&#xD;
      be collected using MED C form. MED C form will include data on each Gram- negative isolate.&#xD;
      Note, each time that the patient has a new positive blood culture for Gram - negative&#xD;
      bacteria, a new MED C form should be filled. Repeated isolation of same pathogen, with same&#xD;
      in vitro susceptibility will be considered as one isolate. We ask that MED C forms will be&#xD;
      sent within 3 months from the end of the episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline data on all the patients who will develop blood stream Gram-negative bacterial&#xD;
      infections during the study period will be reported using the MED A form, which is routinely&#xD;
      filled for all patients in the centers that belong to the EBMT. We ask that it will be filled&#xD;
      within 3 months from the end of the 6 months after HSCT (or earlier if the patient ceased).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resistance to antibiotics will be studied by in-vitro sensitivity tests performed by the&#xD;
      local laboratories. The characteristics of the local laboratories, including essential data&#xD;
      on methods used to determine susceptibility of isolates and guidelines used to determine&#xD;
      susceptibility will be reported in the Centre Registration Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collaborator from each center will be responsible for the reports from laboratories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The analysis of the data will be mostly descriptive. The incidence of&#xD;
      resistance will be computed as a percentage, the denominator being the number of episodes of&#xD;
      Gram-negative bacteremia, and the numerator being the number of episodes classified as&#xD;
      &quot;resistant&quot;. The relationship between Resistance and prognostic factors / characteristics&#xD;
      will be investigated mostly in univariate analysis, applying standard summary measures&#xD;
      (tables, quantiles) and non-parametric tests (chi-squared or Fisher Exact, Mann-Whitney or&#xD;
      Kruskal-Wallis) - for categorical and continuous variables respectively. Possibly, a&#xD;
      multivariate analysis could also be applied, using logistic regression; random effects models&#xD;
      or GEE could be used to account for dependence of observations - nested by patient and&#xD;
      center. The short-term mortality (at 7 and 30 days) will be computed as a percentage - unless&#xD;
      a relevant proportion of loss to follow-up will be observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data collection will be performed by the IDWP data office (Leiden) according to EBMT&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
