      During operations to treat abdominal problems the blood pressure can fall, resulting in falls&#xD;
      in blood flow to the vital organs. This fall can be treated by the administration of drugs&#xD;
      that cause constriction of blood vessels. Although these drugs correct falls in blood&#xD;
      pressure, it is unclear what effect they have on blood flow from the heart and to the vital&#xD;
      organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study of healthy volunteers we aim to better understand the changes in blood flow in&#xD;
      both small and large vessels that occur in response to administration of these drugs. To do&#xD;
      this we will use two different techniques of ultrasound imaging. A narrow (4-5mm) ultrasound&#xD;
      probe will be inserted into the oesophagus via a nostril to measure blood flow in a major&#xD;
      blood vessel. A second probe will rest on the abdomen and will record changes in blood flow&#xD;
      in small vessels of the liver. Two drugs which raise the blood pressure via different&#xD;
      mechanisms will be administered and the changes in flow from the heart and to vital organs&#xD;
      will be measured and compared.&#xD;

      Optimising the cardiac output is essential to ensure adequate organ perfusion in patients who&#xD;
      are undergoing major surgery. To enable this cardiac output (CO) is frequently monitored&#xD;
      during operations using a variety of techniques; one such technique is trans-oesophageal&#xD;
      Doppler ultrasound also known as oesophageal Doppler monitoring (ODM). ODM measurement of CO&#xD;
      is a less invasive technique than many currently used methods, and has recently been&#xD;
      recommended by NICE for adoption in clinical practice. The matching of microvascular blood&#xD;
      flow and CO is advantageous for visceral organs, in marrying demands for oxygen and nutrients&#xD;
      to their delivery. Major surgery and the attendant requirement for general anaesthesia can&#xD;
      result in dramatic changes in blood pressure (BP) and CO. These changes can be corrected by&#xD;
      the administration of vasoactive drugs such as phenylephrine and ephedrine, although it is&#xD;
      unclear what effects these drugs have on microvascular blood flow (MVBF) to the&#xD;
      intra-abdominal viscera. Whilst they correct falls in BP, and hence may increase visceral&#xD;
      flow, this increased BP is partially mediated via splanchnic vasoconstriction, which may&#xD;
      result in decreased blood flow. A greater appreciation of the effect of these vasoactive&#xD;
      drugs on the CO and MVBF may help with the development of more refined algorithms for their&#xD;
      use in the clinical setting. In our clinical physiology laboratories we regularly employ&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) using a Phillips iU22, to measure MVBF in healthy males&#xD;
      following a variety of physiological challenges. This minimally invasive ultrasound based&#xD;
      imaging technique is ideal for gaining an insight into the effect various physiological&#xD;
      interventions have on tissue blood flow and could be readily used to chart changes in&#xD;
      visceral MVBF and CO following vasoactive drug administration. Transference of this&#xD;
      investigative approach to a clinical setting has the potential to greatly improve the care of&#xD;
      the surgical patient under anaesthesia.&#xD;
