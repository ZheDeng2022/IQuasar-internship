  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Vertigo complaint is one of the common cause of patients who applied to emergency&#xD;
           services.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who have applied to emergency services with vertigo complaint mostly have&#xD;
           nausea as an additionally symptom to this complaint and anti-emetic agents can be used&#xD;
           in their treatments very often.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators purpose is to investigate the advantages of Dimenhydrinate and&#xD;
           metoclopramide to each other in the treatment of vertigo and the vertigo accompanied by&#xD;
           nausea&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Vertigo describes the illusion of being subject to an involuntary movement, usually&#xD;
           rotational, of the patient or the patient's surroundings which is caused by sudden tonic&#xD;
           neural activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The management and episodic treatment of patients with spontaneous vertigo related&#xD;
           nausea-vomiting symptoms are somewhat controversial in the emergency department setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients admitted to the emergency department with complaints of vertigo in addition to&#xD;
           a large portion of the symptoms are accompanied by nausea and antiemetic agents are&#xD;
           frequently used in the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An ideal treatment should be rapid in onset and effective, and lack debilitating side&#xD;
           effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Although a wide variety of classes of pharmacologic agents and modalities are used, the&#xD;
           emergency department treatment of acute spontaneous vertigo and associated with nausea-&#xD;
           vomiting has not been well studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It has been reported that the most commonly used medications for parenteral treatment of&#xD;
           vertigo and nausea-vomiting in emergency department are dimenhydrinate (DMT) and&#xD;
           metoclopramide (MTP).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It has a depressant action on hyper-stimulated labyrinthine function and antiemetic&#xD;
           effects, believed to be due to the antihistamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dimenhydrinate inhibits vomiting by affecting the histaminic receptor and cholinergic&#xD;
           receptor function center of vestibular nucleus in the central vestibular system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dimenhydrinate reduces the symptoms of vertigo with depressant effects on the labyrinth&#xD;
           function by this means.&#xD;
