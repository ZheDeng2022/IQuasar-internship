  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metastatic pleural effusion is a common complication of late-stage cancer and reduces the&#xD;
      quality of life and survival of patients. The survival of patients with recurrent pleurisy by&#xD;
      uncontrolled local or systemic treatment is less than 6 months. It is important to develop&#xD;
      specific therapies to improve the quality of life and survival of patients with metastatic&#xD;
      pleurisy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab is a monoclonal anti vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which has proven&#xD;
      effective in many indications in oncology. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an&#xD;
      angiogenic factor which increases endothelial permeability. It plays a central role in many&#xD;
      tumors of epithelial origin. In this context, it is legitimate to ask whether an&#xD;
      antiangiogenic targeting VEGF may be effective in patients with metastatic pleurisy by&#xD;
      decreasing local blood supply and over-permeability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No study has been interested in the intra-pleural pharmacokinetics of monoclonal antibodies&#xD;
      and there are no predictive or prognostic biomarkers for metastatic pleural effusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that intrapleural administration of bevacizumab will reduce the&#xD;
      pleural vasculature permeability. It will neutralize VEGF present in pleural fluid and reduce&#xD;
      the replenishment of effusion due to its prolonged half-life of 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore propose a phase I study to determine the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      and the recommended dose for phases II, studying the pharmacokinetics of intrapleural&#xD;
      bevacizumab administered by an implantable device after evacuating a symptomatic metastatic&#xD;
      pleurisy as part of a mammary carcinoma. The VEGF intrapleural levels and serum will be study&#xD;
      and the time until a new puncture. Dyspnea will be evaluated as well as its impact on quality&#xD;
      of life.&#xD;
