    <textblock>
      Women with Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) experience multiple fertility treatments, a long&#xD;
      treatment duration and a low pregnancy prevalence. This syndrome is frequently accompanied by&#xD;
      overweight and insulin resistance which can mediate the limited response to fertility&#xD;
      treatment. The Endobarrier device was shown to be efficient in weight and glucose lowering.&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the ability of the Endobarrier device to improve the&#xD;
      outcome of fertility treatments in women with PCOS.&#xD;

      1. PCOS Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy among women of&#xD;
           reproductive age, associated with reproductive and metabolic dysfunction with a&#xD;
           prevalence of 5-10% of reproductive aged women.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Diagnostic criteria vary and according to the Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRM- Sponsored PCOS&#xD;
           Consensus Workshop Group PCOS is defined when at least two of the following three&#xD;
           criteria are present: [i] polycystic ovaries, by ultrasound [ii] oligo and/or&#xD;
           anovulation, and [iii] clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The clinical presentation varies from amenorrhea and a sonographic picture of polycystic&#xD;
           ovaries but with subtle phenotypic abnormalities or signs of hyperandrogenism, to&#xD;
           advanced Stein and Leventhal syndrome with clinical heterogeneity as the rule. Moreover,&#xD;
           women with PCOS might exhibit features of the metabolic syndrome, including impaired&#xD;
           glucose tolerance (IGT), obesity and dyslipidaemia ,with their associated long- term&#xD;
           sequelae, namely endometrial carcinoma, hypertension, type 2 diabetes (T2D) and&#xD;
           cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Impaired Glucose Intolerance (IGT) and PCOS Impaired glucose tolerance, or insulin&#xD;
           resistance, are defined as decreased insulin-mediated glucose utilization. It has long&#xD;
           been recognized as a major risk factor for diabetes. Moreover, it was shown that&#xD;
           lifestyle intervention or metformin in patients with IGT, may reduce the prevalence of&#xD;
           T2D. Several dynamic invasive tests and calculated indices are currently available for&#xD;
           detecting IGT. While the euglycemic clamp technique is considered the most accurate test&#xD;
           for the assessment of insulin resistance, this cumbersome test is frequently replaced by&#xD;
           the simple measurement of the ratio of fasting glucose to fasting insulin, or the 2-hour&#xD;
           glucose level after a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (WHO criteria, impaired&#xD;
           glucose tolerance [IGT] &gt;140 mg/dL to 199 mg/dL). As a result, reports of the prevalence&#xD;
           on IGT in women with PCOS vary depending on the sensitivity and specificity of the tests&#xD;
           employed and the heterogenic phenotypes of PCOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Obesity - definition, significance and prevalence among women with PCOS:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Obesity, a common clinical manifestation of PCOS patients, is linked to insulin&#xD;
           resistance and failure or delayed response to the various COH treatments.The associated&#xD;
           health detriments of this major health problem are increased with increasing body mass&#xD;
           index (BMI). Data regarding the impact of obesity on IVF cycles outcome is&#xD;
           controversial, ranging from studies reporting on no effect of increasing BMI on IVF&#xD;
           success rates to those demonstrating a lower cumulative live birth rates in overweight&#xD;
           patients. PCOS and assisted reproduction PCOS women with insulin resistance undergoing&#xD;
           ovulation induction with gonadotropin have a longer duration of treatment, use a higher&#xD;
           total FSH dose, have an elevated cancellation rate and a lower conception rate.&#xD;
           Improving insulin sensitivity through both lifestyle and pharmacological intervention&#xD;
           were suggested to ameliorate the aforementioned abnormalities, restore ovulation and&#xD;
           enhance pregnancy in women with PCOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In vitro fertilization (IVF) and embryo transfer (ET) is an effective therapy for PCOS&#xD;
           patients and results in pregnancy rates that are comparable with those for women with&#xD;
           tubal factor infertility. Moreover, because the number of multiple pregnancies can be&#xD;
           kept to a minimum by transferring small numbers of embryos, IVF-ET became a reasonable&#xD;
           option to PCOS patients who are refractory to conventional infertility modalities or who&#xD;
           have coexisting infertility factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Many controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) strategies have been offered for the&#xD;
           treatment of patients with PCOS undergoing IVF.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In an attempt to examine the influence of BMI on IVF outcome in patients undergoing COH&#xD;
           with either GnRH-agonist or antagonist, the investigators found that while in patients&#xD;
           with BMI&gt;25 kg/m2, COH with either GnRH-agonist or antagonist achieved a comparable&#xD;
           outcome, in those with BMI&lt;25 kg/m2, the use of GnRH-agonist suppressive protocol&#xD;
           revealed a significantly higher pregnancy rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Moreover, in another study of PCOS patients undergoing IVF-ET cycles, the investigators&#xD;
           demonstrated that COH utilizing the midluteal long GnRH-agonist suppressive protocol was&#xD;
           the protocol of choice in lean patients, probably due to its ability to lower the high&#xD;
           basal LH milieu and its detrimental effect of oocytes' quality and implantation&#xD;
           potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Device Description ENDOBARRIER The EndoBarrier Gastrointestinal Liner system received CE&#xD;
           Mark on 11 December 2009 and is indicated for the treatment of obesity and Type 2&#xD;
           diabetes. The implant is indicated for a maximum implant duration period of twelve&#xD;
           months. The intent of the EndoBarrier is to facilitate glycemic control and weight loss&#xD;
           by mimicking portions of the Roux-en-Y bypass procedure. The device consists of 3&#xD;
           components: the implant, the delivery system, and the removal system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure entails bypassing the duodenum and the proximal jejunum with a 60 cm&#xD;
      non-permeable polymeric sleeve which is attached to the duodenal wall. This sleeve prevents&#xD;
      the contact of food with the duodenal wall, thereby re-capitulating one of the major&#xD;
      properties of the RYGB operation. With this technique, control of diabetes is accompanied by&#xD;
      weight loss, with no need for medications that may cause weight gain / hypoglycemia and may&#xD;
      serve to replace or postpone surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent paper by de Moura et al, Twenty-two subjects with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      and a body mass index between 40- 60 kg/m ² were implanted with the EndoBarrier and followed&#xD;
      prospectively for 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The authors found statistically significant reductions in fasting blood glucose (- 30.3 ±&#xD;
      10.2 mg/dL), fasting insulin (- 7.3 ± 2.6 lU/mL), and HbA1c ( - 2.1±0.3%) in patients&#xD;
      undergoing the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study conclusions were that EndoBarrier improves glycemic status in obese subjects with&#xD;
      diabetes and therefore represents a non-surgical, reversible alternative to bariatric&#xD;
      surgery. Internal data from GI Dynamics reveals that obese subject (average BMI of 44 kg/m²)&#xD;
      and uncontrolled diabetes ( average A1c of 8.4 %) who were implanted with EndoBarrier for one&#xD;
      year showed the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A reduction of 2.1% of the A1c level, with a value of less than 7% in 80% of the&#xD;
           subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. An average reduction of 20 Kg (representing 16% of the excess weight).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A 29% reduction in the triglyceride level and a 14% reduction in LDL-c. After 12 months&#xD;
           the EndoBarrier was removed and the subjects remained in follow up for additional 18&#xD;
           months. During this period, the achievement was maintained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Study Design: This is a two arm open-label three phase trail investigating the effect of&#xD;
      an EndoBarrier device on fertility and metabolic parameters in obese insulin resistant (IR)&#xD;
      PCOS women Arm 1: women seeking pregnancy after failed IVF treatment cycle/s. Arm 2: women&#xD;
      seeking pregnancy after failure to ovulate in response to clomiphene citrate (CC) -&#xD;
      clomiphene resistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: (treatment phase) - Six months with Endobarrier Phase 2: (follow-up phase) - Twelve&#xD;
      months after Endobarrier retrieval Phase 3: (long term observation phase) - to see whether&#xD;
      and when a pregnancy was achieved within the second year after retrieval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Methods and assessments: 4.1 Visit 1- screening All potential patients will be screened&#xD;
      for eligibility at visit 1. Informed consent (ICF) will be explained to the patient prior to&#xD;
      conducting any study procedures. A discussion in which the patient is explained about the&#xD;
      advantage and disadvantage of the trail and the trail procedures will be taken. If&#xD;
      participation is agreed to by the patient after they read the ICF, the patient will sign and&#xD;
      date the ICF, and get a copy of the signed and dated form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following activities will occur on Visit 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient signs the ICF form A patient number will be assigned to the patient. Inclusion /&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria will be reviewed. Demographic data : Age. Medical history evaluation and&#xD;
      concomitant medication record. A physical and gynecological examination (including Ultrasound&#xD;
      of Ovaries) will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An oral OGTT 75g will be performed. Fasting Laboratory measurements will be performed A date&#xD;
      for visit 2 will be scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 visit 2 - Gastro screening&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following activities will occur on Visit 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be referred to the Gastroenterology department for Gastroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be instructed to start 40 mg Omeprazole twice daily 3 days prior to visit 4&#xD;
      (Implantation of the Endobarrier).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be instructed to start contraceptive from now on. Diet consultation will be&#xD;
      performed The patient will be asked to answer the &quot;Visual analog scale&quot; (VAS) questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A date for visit 3 will be scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3 visit 3 - Endobarrier implantation The patient will arrive in a fasting state. The&#xD;
      patient will be asked about any AE's and change in medications. Vital signs, weight, waist&#xD;
      circumferences will be measured. Fasting Laboratory measurements will be performed Under full&#xD;
      anesthesia (in order to achieve the best conditions for the accurate positioning of the&#xD;
      device) gastroscopy will be performed and a guide wire will be inserted to the jejunum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Endobarrirer device will be inserted over the guide wire and introduced into the duodenal&#xD;
      bulb. The correct location of the device will be evaluated by the endoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under fluoroscopy the device will be operated and the sleeve will be released from its&#xD;
      capsule. Contrast material will be injected thorough the sleeve to insure full opening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After full expansion of the sleeve, the anchoring mechanism will be operated and the sleeve&#xD;
      will be anchored by small hooks to the duodenal bulb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correct hooking will be visualized endoscopically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4 visits 4-9 The patient will be asked about any AE's and change in medications. Vital&#xD;
      signs, weight, waist circumferences will be measured. Fasting Laboratory measurements will be&#xD;
      performed Diet consultation will be performed. The patient will be asked to answer the&#xD;
      &quot;Visual analog scale&quot; (VAS) questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.5 visit 10- pre-retrieval visit The patient will be asked about any AE's and change in&#xD;
      medications. Vital signs, weight, waist circumferences will be measured. Fasting laboratory&#xD;
      measurements will be performed The patient will be asked to answer the &quot;Visual analog scale&quot;&#xD;
      (VAS) questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.6 visit 11- Endobarrier retrieval The retrieval procedure will be performed after sedation.&#xD;
      A retrieval hood will be connected to the endoscope tip. A scope will be introduced to the&#xD;
      duodenum. A retrieval grasper will be inserted through the scope. By pulling the drawstring&#xD;
      the anchoring hook will collapse and when all hooks are within the plastic retrieval hood the&#xD;
      endoscope will be withdrawn safely out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be referred to the infertility Clinic for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.7 visit 12-19 - once in 3M follow up Patient will come to a visit once every 3 months,&#xD;
      until pregnancy is achieved or until the end of the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be asked about any AE's and change in medications. Gynecological exam (may&#xD;
      include Ultrasound of Ovaries) may be performed. Fasting laboratory measurements will be&#xD;
      performed The patient will be asked to answer the &quot;Visual analog scale&quot; (VAS) questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be required to provide the site will data regarding last fertility treatment&#xD;
