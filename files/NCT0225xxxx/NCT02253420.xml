    <description>To evaluate the effect of Itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics of Copanlisib (BAY80-6946) and safety in patients with advanced solid tumor. Cycle 1 of the study will be conducted in 2 parts: Part 1 and part 2:&#xD;
Part 1 of Cycle 1: 6 patients will be enrolled and will receive 12 mg of copanlisib on Day 1 and Day 15. Itraconazole 200 mg will be administered twice a day on Day 12 and then once daily from Days 13 to 21.&#xD;
Part 2 of Cycle 1: 20 patients will be enrolled and receive copanlisib doses of either 12 mg, 30 mg or 60 mg on Days 1 and 15 with the same dose administered on both days. Copanlisib dose for Part 2 will be based on safety and copanlisib pharmacokinetics in Part 1. Itraconazole 200 mg will be administered twice a day on Day 12 and then once daily from Days 13 to 21.&#xD;
Cycle 2 and subsequent cycles: All patients will receive copanlisib doses of 60 mg on Days 1, 8 and 15.</description>

    <description>To evaluate the effect of Rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of Copanlisib (BAY 80-6946) and safety in patients with advanced solid tumor or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in Cycle 1. Approximately 30 subjects will receive 60mg of copanlisib on Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 1 Day 15. Rifampin will be administered once a day from Cycle 1 Day 10 to Day 21. Holter monitoring will be performed on Cycle 1 Day -1 and Cycle 1 Day 1 to evaluate the effect of copanlisib on the QT/QTc assessment.&#xD;
Cycle 2 and subsequent cycles, all patients will receive copanlisib dose of 60 mg on Days 1, 8 and 15. Holter monitoring will be performed on Cycle 3 Day 1 and Cycle 6 Day 1.</description>
