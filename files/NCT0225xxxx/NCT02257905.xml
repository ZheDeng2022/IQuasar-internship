  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Light-chain (AL-) amyloidosis is a very rare monoclonal plasma cell disorder with poor&#xD;
      prognosis. Rarity of disease has precluded performance of randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      comparing various possible treatment modalities. In general, treatment of AL amyloidosis has&#xD;
      been adapted from myeloma (MM) therapy. There is large experience with allo SCT in MM. Based&#xD;
      on small series of patients and case reports allogeneic transplant has emerged as potentially&#xD;
      effective. However, more formal proof of concept of using allogeneic hematopoietic&#xD;
      transplantation for treatment of AL Amyloidosis is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, given the limitations of conventionally collected registry data (dubious follow-up&#xD;
      information and extreme heterogeneity), we developed the: &quot;EBMT non-interventional&#xD;
      prospective study on allogeneic transplantation in AL Amyloidosis&quot; which means that&#xD;
      transplant centers that already do perform allogeneic transplants for AL Amyloidosis will be&#xD;
      encouraged to register their patients with AL Amyloidosis very timely with the EBMT, followed&#xD;
      by mandatory submission of EBMT MedB and follow-up forms. The diagnosis of AL Amyloidosis&#xD;
      would be based on uniform criteria. All EBMT centres performing allogeneic transplants for&#xD;
      Amyloidosis will be invited to participate in this study and centres will be asked to report&#xD;
      all AL Amyloidosis cases referred for transplantation using a simple registration form and&#xD;
      then to submit Amyloidosis MED B forms for each transplanted patient and follow-up forms as&#xD;
      necessary. In conclusion, it should be possible to largely improve the usual quality of&#xD;
      registry-based data and to generate scientifically sound knowledge on HSCT in an orphan&#xD;
      disease such as AL Amyloidosis.&#xD;

      Short description of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to select those centres within the EBMT that in the past have performed any&#xD;
      allogeneic transplant for amyloidosis and ask them to participate by completing a centre&#xD;
      registration form. When they have a patient they want to include in this study, the centre&#xD;
      will notify the CLWP data office of the planned allogeneic transplant the day before the&#xD;
      transplant takes place. For this, the centre can use a patient registration form. Once a&#xD;
      patient is included, MED B and regular follow-up are mandatory. Data entry of MED B forms and&#xD;
      follow up will be performed in the way that is usual for the centre (either by the centre&#xD;
      itself, by the national registry or by the Paris data office). The CLWP data office will keep&#xD;
      track of the data submitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed as a non-interventional prospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male or female subjects, 18 years to 60 years, with AL amyloidosis who will receive&#xD;
      allogeneic transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to be collected/analysed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this study is efficacy (best hematological remission and organ&#xD;
      response) of allogeneic SCT in patients with AL amyloidosis. The secondary endpoints are&#xD;
      acute and chronic GvHD, TRM and event-free and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of the non-interventional prospective study request:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this non-interventional prospective study is the evaluation of the&#xD;
      effectiveness of allogeneic transplant for AL Amyloidosis. It is planned that results will be&#xD;
      presented on scientific symposia and that they will suffice for at least one publication&#xD;
      (original article).&#xD;
