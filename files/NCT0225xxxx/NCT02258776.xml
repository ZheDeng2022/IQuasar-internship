    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of pomegranate extract and pomegranate&#xD;
      juice on skin inflammation and aging. The information gained from this study may lead to the&#xD;
      development of a pomegranate product that can decrease the effects of aging, inflammation and&#xD;
      harmful bacteria on the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, two pomegranate products (extract and juice) will be compared with a placebo,&#xD;
      a study product that looks like pomegranate extract, but contains no active ingredients.&#xD;

      Pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) is grown commercially in the Near East, India, Spain, Israel&#xD;
      and the United States (California) where it is of significant economic importance1.&#xD;
      Pomegranate fruits and products, including juice, tea, wine and extracts are widely consumed&#xD;
      and recognized for their health benefits. Pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) fruit possesses&#xD;
      strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative properties. In recent years, most&#xD;
      health advantages of pomegranate have been attributed to the presence of ellagitannins,&#xD;
      mainly punicalagins and ellagic acid. Punicalagin is unique to pomegranate and is part of a&#xD;
      family of ellagitannins. The ellagitannins are hydrolyzed to ellagic acid in the gut, and&#xD;
      further metabolized by the colon microflora to form urolith A and B. Investigations using&#xD;
      pure bacterial cultures have shown that pomegranate by-products and punicalagins&#xD;
      significantly inhibited the growth of pathogenic Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,&#xD;
      clostridia and Staphylococcus aureus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral feeding of pomegranate fruit extract to mice afforded protection to mouse skin against&#xD;
      the adverse effects of ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation by modulating UVB-induced signaling&#xD;
      pathways.5 Hydroalcoholic extract based-ointment from pomegranate was reported improving&#xD;
      wound healing in vivo. Pomegranate ellagitannins have been demonstrated to have antimicrobial&#xD;
      activity. Punicalagin is unique to pomegranate and is part of a family of ellagitannins. The&#xD;
      ellagitannins are hydrolyzed to ellagic acid in the gut, and further metabolized by the colon&#xD;
      microflora to form urolith A and B. Investigations using pure bacterial cultures have shown&#xD;
      that pomegranate by-products and punicalagins significantly inhibited the growth of&#xD;
      pathogenic Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, clostridia and Staphylococcus aureus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pomegranate Extract (POMx) is made from pomegranate fruit as a byproduct of pomegranate juice&#xD;
      (PJ) production. A second pressing of the fruit liberates a complex mixture of hydrolysable&#xD;
      polyphenolic compounds normally ingested with pomegranate juice, and these are purified by&#xD;
      spray drying. POMx powder is encapsulated for oral administration, with each capsule&#xD;
      containing 1,000 mg of pomegranate polyphenols. The present study will determine whether a&#xD;
      pomegranate product (POMx or PJ) can decrease skin photoaging, inflammation and skin&#xD;
      pathogenic bacteria.&#xD;
