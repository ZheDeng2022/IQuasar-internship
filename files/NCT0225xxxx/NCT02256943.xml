  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low dose tricyclic antidepressant drugs are routinely administered co-analgesics in pain&#xD;
      medicine. Amitriptyline is largely considered as a gold standard. Amitriptyline underlies&#xD;
      cytochrome CYP2D6 and CYP2D19 metabolism. CYP2D6 is highly polymorphic; numerous genetic&#xD;
      variants result in 4 major classes characterizing enzymatic activity: poor metabolizers,&#xD;
      intermediate metabolizers, extensive metabolizers and ultrarapid metabolizers. It is not&#xD;
      known to which extent metabolizer classes determine pain outcomes or side-effects. As only&#xD;
      one in three pain patients is considered to be a responder to amitriptyline's co-analgesic&#xD;
      effect, prediction of treatment efficacy with a fast and easy to perform bedside test may&#xD;
      contribute to the patients quality of life. The aim of this study is to determine the&#xD;
      influence of cytochrome variants on experimental pain, drug related side-effects and finally&#xD;
      identification of active metabolites.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain is defined as an ongoing unpleasant sensory experience, which can be classified&#xD;
      according to three major, although overlapping, etiologies: nociceptive, inflammatory and&#xD;
      neuropathic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antidepressants are widely used as co-analgesics in the management of chronic pain. An&#xD;
      overview of different substances and their relation to their mechanism of action is presented&#xD;
      in the review of Dharmashaktu et al. Low-dose tricyclic antidepressants are well established&#xD;
      in the treatment of neuropathic pain. Amitriptyline and imipramine are two widely used&#xD;
      substances of this group. The hypoalgesic effect of amitriptyline is mainly mediated by&#xD;
      inhibiting serotoninergic and noradrenergic reuptake. When administered at night time,&#xD;
      amitriptyline's sedating effect enhances sleep quality, considered as an important&#xD;
      improvement in quality of life in chronic pain patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tricyclic antidepressants undergo biotransformation in the liver with CYP2D6 catalyzing&#xD;
      hydroxylation, whereas CYP2C19 mediates demethylation of the parent drug. The demethylated&#xD;
      metabolites are partially tricyclic drugs by themselves, such as nortriptyline and&#xD;
      desipramine, which are demethyl-metabolites of amitriptyline and imipramine. It is unknown&#xD;
      whether the analgesic effect of amitriptyline is mediated through its precursor or the&#xD;
      metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CYP2D6 gene is highly polymorphic and the numerous genetic variants result in 4 major&#xD;
      metabolizer classes characterizing enzyme activity: poor metabolizers (PM) with no enzyme&#xD;
      activity, intermediate metabolizers (IM) with reduced enzyme activity, (EM) extensive&#xD;
      metabolizers carrying two functionally active alleles and ultrarapid metabolizers (UM)&#xD;
      carrying a gene duplication or multi-duplication resulting in increased enzyme activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CYP2D6 PMs have higher plasma concentrations of the parent drug than EMs and are, therefore,&#xD;
      more likely to experience dose-dependent adverse drug reactions. In 50 psychiatric patients&#xD;
      receiving amitriptyline 150 mg/d, carriers of two functional CYP2D6 alleles (EMs) had a&#xD;
      significantly lower risk of side effects than IM (12.1% vs. 76.5%). The lowest risk was&#xD;
      observed for carriers of two functional CYP2D6 alleles combined with only one functional&#xD;
      CYP2C19 allele. The combination of normal (fast) CYP2C19 and slightly diminished CYP2D6&#xD;
      function leads to high concentrations of toxic intermediate metabolites and an increase of&#xD;
      adverse events. On the other hand, CYP2D6 UMs may be at risk for sub-therapeutic&#xD;
      concentrations resulting in poor therapeutic response. Thus, genetically determined&#xD;
      differences in blood concentrations of antidepressants make dose adjustments advisable.&#xD;
      However, these findings and dose recommendations have only been evaluated for psychiatric&#xD;
      patients and no investigation on antidepressants as low-dosed co-analgesics are available up&#xD;
      to now.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative sensory tests (QST) have been intensively used for more than three decades to&#xD;
      explore the central processing of painful stimuli in patients and healthy volunteers. QST&#xD;
      were developed to assess the responses to sensory stimuli, providing psychophysical methods&#xD;
      for the assessment of the nociceptive system. In addition, large cohorts of healthy&#xD;
      volunteers have been investigated using QST measures to produce reference values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QST measures are based on a multimodal and multi-tissue approach, combining different pain&#xD;
      modalities applied to different tissues in order to gather sufficient and discriminative&#xD;
      information about the human nociceptive system. QST will be our tool to characterize&#xD;
      analgesic efficacy of amitriptyline. QST offers the unique opportunity of experimentally&#xD;
      induced pain being quantitatively measured by psychophysical, behavioural and&#xD;
      neurophysiological responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      We test the hypothesis that the extensive and ultrarapid CYP2D6 metabolizers are associated&#xD;
      with a higher analgesic effect of amitriptyline, compared to the poor and intermediate&#xD;
      metabolizers, as assessed by quantitative sensory tests. Plasma concentrations of&#xD;
      amitriptyline and its metabolites will be analysed as co-variates for drug efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two sub-studies, one peak-level, single-dose administration and one steady-state, repeated&#xD;
      dose administration, are needed to assess the pharmacokinetics of amitriptyline and its&#xD;
      active metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics are provided by Jos√© A. Biurrun Manresa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two consecutive randomized placebo-controlled two-way crossover sub-studies on amitriptyline&#xD;
      will be conducted in consenting, healthy, male volunteers. Both sub-studies have the same&#xD;
      aim: to determine the association between CYP2D6 genotype, drug response measured by QST and&#xD;
      plasma concentrations of amitriptyline and its metabolites. The first sub-study will be&#xD;
      conducted with a single high dose of amitriptyline (100 mg). The second sub-study will be&#xD;
      conducted with repeated low doses of amitriptyline (25 mg) once a day for 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both sub-studies the same experimental procedures and statistical analyses will be&#xD;
      performed. The only difference between the sub-studies is the dose of amitriptyline and the&#xD;
      duration of drug intake.&#xD;
