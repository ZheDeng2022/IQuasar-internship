  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acid suppressive therapy (AST) is used in a variety of indications in prevention and&#xD;
      treatment of gastric acid related disorders. In recent years, an increase in the use of acid&#xD;
      suppressive therapy has been documented. It has generally been accepted that these agents are&#xD;
      effective and safe. However, very recently, reports describing hypomagnesaemia, hypocalcemia,&#xD;
      vitamin B12 deficiency and enteric infections, were published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to evaluate 1) how many cases of long-term ambulatory treatment&#xD;
      with AST are initiated during hospital stay (= ASTRA-1), and 2) assess the appropriateness of&#xD;
      initiation of AST and the appropriateness of continuation of AST at discharge in a subset of&#xD;
      the hospitalized patient population (= ASTRA-2). Finally, the pharmacoeconomic impact of&#xD;
      inappropriate AST during hospitalisation will be calculated from these data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is defined as the number of patients on long-term ambulatory AST after&#xD;
      initiation in the hospital. Secondary endpoints are the appropriateness check of AST both at&#xD;
      the level of initiation during hospitalization and at discharge (appropriate continuation);&#xD;
      also the impact on the hospital budget (lump sum budget) will be calculated, and potential&#xD;
      cost avoidance for long-term ambulatory inappropriate AST will be estimated from a healthcare&#xD;
      payer perspective for a period of 1, 3, 6 and 12 months.&#xD;

      ASTRA 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      A retrospective, multi-centric, observational study will be carried out in 9 Belgian&#xD;
      hospitals. Patients will be recruited hospital wide in all participating hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All hospitalized adult patients (defined as 18 years or older at the moment of discharge)&#xD;
      discharged from participating hospitals from in 01-07-2012 until 01-07-2013 will be included,&#xD;
      if they were treated at any moment during hospitalization with AST (both H2A, defined as all&#xD;
      drugs belonging to ATC A02BA, and PPI, defined as all drugs belonging to ATC A02BC). Younger&#xD;
      patients are excluded as they are often treated with compounded suspensions and these&#xD;
      preparations are impossible to match with the dispensed medication. Fulfillment of these&#xD;
      criteria will be based on queries retrieving data from the hospital information system. The&#xD;
      query will generate, for each participating hospital, a list of unique hospitalizations. In&#xD;
      order to guaranty the patients privacy, datasets will be made anonymous by a trusted third&#xD;
      party (see further in protocol). Reporting will be anonymous, never on an individual patient,&#xD;
      physician or hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this list, all potentially interesting covariates will be documented by adding coded&#xD;
      patient-related data, in order to allow determination of associated risk factors by uni- and&#xD;
      multivariate analysis. The following patient-related information will be requested from the&#xD;
      HIS: number of participating hospital, date of admission and discharge, age, weight, sex,&#xD;
      region of living, length of stay, diagnosis on admission, hospital outcome in terms of&#xD;
      mortality, comorbidity details (based on ICD-9 coding), presence of gastro(duodenal)&#xD;
      investigations during hospital stay (eg. gastroscopy), discipline of treating clinician&#xD;
      and/or hospital ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with multiple hospitalizations during the inclusion period will be included. Each&#xD;
      separate hospitalization will be counted as a separate line in the database. Bias is expected&#xD;
      to be minimal as long-term use of AST will exclude the subsequent hospitalization periods&#xD;
      because the patient would not be naive to AST on admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size of the dataset is not limited for ASTRA-1 in order to provide the maximum&#xD;
      power to the study, but will include a minimum of 5000 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The datasets, along with covariates and related data, will be anonymized by Custodix, a&#xD;
      Trusted Third Party, experienced in anonymizing hospital data. All anonymized datasets will&#xD;
      be linked by the trusted third party over the anonymized patient number with the anonymized&#xD;
      IMS-database of ambulatory dispensed medication. All further queries will be performed on&#xD;
      this anonymized set of data which combines patients covariates and ambulatory consumption of&#xD;
      relevant medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients on long-term ambulatory AST (defined as continued use during &gt; 3 months) without&#xD;
      ambulatory use before hospitalization are the ones we would like to investigate in the&#xD;
      primary endpoint analysis of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will determine the number of those patients vs. all discharged adult patients and also vs.&#xD;
      the number of adult patients with AST treatment at any moment during hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More in detail, descriptive statistics will be carried out using appropriate parametric or&#xD;
      non- parametric tests (Student t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test, based on distribution of data)&#xD;
      to describe the demographics of the included patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be divided in 3 groups: 1) patients on AST before admission (whether therapy is&#xD;
      stopped or continued during hospitalization), 2) patients started on AST during&#xD;
      hospitalization but stopped before or at discharge and 3) patients started on AST during&#xD;
      hospitalization and continued use after discharge. For patients in group 3, we will describe&#xD;
      what the proportion of patients is with use of AST at +1, 3, 6 and 12 months after discharge,&#xD;
      therefore group 3 will be subdivided along with these proportions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate potential risk factors correlating with long-term use, groups 2 and 3 will be&#xD;
      compared using uni- and multivariate analysis evaluating associated risk factors such as age,&#xD;
      sex, weight, comorbidities, type of wards, and concomitant medication. A subgroup comparison&#xD;
      between groups 2 and 3(b+c+d) will be carried out to discuss risk factors associated with&#xD;
      continued long-term use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be carried out in SPSS or SAS by the investigator in collaboration&#xD;
      with L-Biostat (KU Leuven).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this dataset an estimate on cost of AST from a healthcare payer perspective will be&#xD;
      calculated using the list price (= public price) at 01-07-2013 of the involved medication. In&#xD;
      combination with the results of ASTRA-2 the impact of parameters like percent of&#xD;
      appropriateness, duration of therapy, diagnosis and comorbidities will be studied in a&#xD;
      multivariate analysis. As the main dataset from ASTRA-2 comes from UZ Leuven, the other&#xD;
      participating hospitals are each requested to review 20 medical files from their hospital in&#xD;
      order to investigate possible extrapolation bias or to support the findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASTRA 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      A retrospective, non-interventional, multi-centric study will be carried in the participating&#xD;
      hospitals. Patients will be recruited hospital wide in all participating hospitals. The main&#xD;
      number of inclusions will be in the University hospitals Leuven, inclusions in other&#xD;
      participating hospitals will be used to investigate possible extrapolation bias and to&#xD;
      support the findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All hospitalized patients discharged from the participating hospitals from 01-07-2012 until&#xD;
      01-07-2013 will be included. Exclusion of deceased patients, juvenile patients (defined as&#xD;
      younger than 18 years at time of discharge), critically ill patients, patients without a&#xD;
      startup of AST and patients without AST at discharge leads to the subgroup that is subject of&#xD;
      this research. An overview of the inclusion process is given in figure 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients admitted at the ICU, during hospitalization, will not be included as literature&#xD;
      concerning the use of AST (especially as SUP) in the ICU setting (for critically ill&#xD;
      patients) is already exhaustive 3,15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Startup or initiation of AST during hospitalization is defined as treatment with a H2A&#xD;
      (ATC-classification A02BA) or a PPI (ATC-classification A02BC) starting from day 3 or later&#xD;
      of the hospitalization period. Patients with H2A/PPI treatment before hospitalization will be&#xD;
      excluded as their AST is not initiated in the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient inclusion will be performed based on queries retrieving data from the hospital&#xD;
      information system (admission and discharge data) and from the CPOE (AST prescriptions) of&#xD;
      the participating hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When patients were readmitted to the hospital during the study period, the different&#xD;
      hospitalizations will be evaluated separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of appropriateness of AST will be performed by medical record review by trained&#xD;
      staff pharmacists of the participating hospitals, who can be assisted under close supervision&#xD;
      by master students of the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, and are led by a validated&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The method of reviewing will be subject to an interrater validity evaluation using&#xD;
      kappa-statistic. The sole intend of the record review is to gather data on the use and&#xD;
      appropriateness of AST medication and will not intervene in any way in the therapy nor the&#xD;
      patient - physicians relationship. Reporting will be anonymous, never on an individual&#xD;
      patient, physician or hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimated prevalence of inappropriate AST is unknown. Assuming a worst case scenario of&#xD;
      50 % inappropriate AST, 384 patients would need to be included in the trial for a confidence&#xD;
      interval of 95% (see table below). Assuming a rate of 30 % of inappropriate AST, 323 patients&#xD;
      would need to be included. To guarantee this sample size at least 500 medical files will be&#xD;
      screened in order to compensate for potential dropouts. These 500 medical files will be&#xD;
      randomly selected out of all the included patients using a random code generator. In UZ&#xD;
      Leuven at least 500 medical records will be screened, supplementary other participating&#xD;
      hospitals are requested to screen 20 medical files each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To guarantee a representative sample of the studied population the sample will be checked for&#xD;
      proportional allocation for the baseline variables sex (male/female), age (minus 65 years or&#xD;
      older) and admission label (internal or surgical). In order to prevent selection bias we will&#xD;
      not use random sampling with stratified allocation as we plan no intervention groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Factors justifying AST in non-critically ill hospitalized patients are based on a literature&#xD;
      review an will be used for evaluation of appropriateness and pinpointing risk factors for&#xD;
      inappropriate longterm use of AST after hospitalisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact on cost savings for the hospital population will be studied from the&#xD;
      healthcare-payer perspective. Therefore the official list price for acquisition, which equals&#xD;
      the reimbursement price for hospitalized patients, at 01-07-2013 for the hospital will be&#xD;
      used. In case of inappropriate therapy or late IV/PO switch there is an opportunity for cost&#xD;
      saving. This will be subject to a sensitivity analysis. Besides direct cost savings there may&#xD;
      be a possible long term cost-avoidance, but this is more difficult to calculate because&#xD;
      side-effects of long term therapy are just popping up in research and cannot be monetized&#xD;
      yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extrapolation of the percentage of patient on inappropriate AST in the hospital to&#xD;
      inappropriate continued long-term use will be performed by combining the results of ASTRA-1&#xD;
      and ASTRA-2. In this way the impact on cost from the healthcare payer perspective can be&#xD;
      calculated. In the analysis we will also look at patients compliance, switch to less&#xD;
      expensive products and perform a sensitivity analysis on cost saving as function of timely&#xD;
      stopping the inappropriate therapy.&#xD;
