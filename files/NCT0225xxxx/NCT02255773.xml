  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to learn more about fatigue and how it affects your&#xD;
      behavior as well as your willingness to learn new behaviors.&#xD;

      If you agree to take part in this study, the following tests and procedures will be&#xD;
      performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn to test for markers of inflammation and to test&#xD;
           for genes related to brain signaling. Markers of inflammation are found in the blood and&#xD;
           may be related to your fatigue and other symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete three tasks on a computer. Some of the tasks are easy and you are&#xD;
           already used to them, but other ones will require some learning. You will be given&#xD;
           written instructions on how to complete them. The tasks will be completed in or near the&#xD;
           Head and Neck Cancer outpatient clinics. It should take about 60 minutes to complete all&#xD;
           three tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete 9 questionnaires about your mood, fatigue, sleep quality, and other&#xD;
           symptoms. It should take about 30 minutes to complete these questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaires will be given a code number and stored in a locked file cabinet at MD&#xD;
      Anderson. No identifying information will be directly linked to your questionnaires. Only the&#xD;
      researcher in charge of the study will have access to the code numbers and be able to link&#xD;
      the questionnaires to you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you have completed the blood draw, the computerized tasks, and the questionnaires, your&#xD;
      participation on this study will be over.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any information about your symptoms that is collected as part of this study is for research&#xD;
      purposes only. The questionnaires will only be used for the purposes of this study and will&#xD;
      be destroyed after the study results have been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you describe a symptom as being severe on the symptom questionnaire, a study staff member&#xD;
      will ask you if you have already told or plan to tell your doctor or nurse about the symptom.&#xD;
      If you have not already told your doctor or nurse, a study staff member will tell your doctor&#xD;
      or nurse about the symptom for you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 60 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;

    <description>Endpoint for Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT) is ratio of hard task choices (number of hard task choices/total choices) across levels of probability. Endpoints for associative learning task are number of trials until reaching the a priori defined learning criterion (three consecutive correct responses for each association), indicating goal-directed learning, and number of trials between reaching this criterion and reaching asymptote in the reaction times, indicating establishment of habitual behavior. Set-switching task primary endpoints is difference in reaction times and number of errors between &quot;no-switch&quot; and &quot;switch&quot; trials.</description>

Participants complete questionnaires assessing mood, somatic symptoms, and sleep quality, including the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF), the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS), and others. A 10-mL blood sample drawn for assessment of inflammatory markers and COMT and DAT1 genotype.</description>
