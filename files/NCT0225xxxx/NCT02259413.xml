  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether participation in a 26-week exercise&#xD;
      rehabilitation program is effective at reducing symptom burden and improving quality of life&#xD;
      in individuals receiving chronic hemodialysis.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with end-stage kidney disease requiring HD suffer from multiple symptoms, which&#xD;
      have limited effective treatments. Symptom burden, the combined impact of number and severity&#xD;
      of symptoms, negatively impacts functional status and health-related quality of life (HRQOL)&#xD;
      in HD. Small interventional trials suggest exercise can mitigate specific individual&#xD;
      symptoms, but impact of exercise on overall symptom burden in HD is unknown. Dialysis&#xD;
      patients have identified improving symptom burden and HRQOL as research priorities. We&#xD;
      propose the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigating the effect of exercise&#xD;
      rehabilitation on symptom burden in individuals on HD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: In individuals on HD, participation in a 26-week exercise rehabilitation (rehab)&#xD;
      program will reduce symptom burden and improve HRQOL, resulting in reduced disability and&#xD;
      improved long-term clinical outcomes as compared with standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Single-centre RCT with one-to-one parallel design, allocation concealment and&#xD;
      assessor blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Adults receiving chronic in-centre HD for &gt; 3 months with at least one&#xD;
      dialysis-related symptom; n=150&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Standard care plus 26-week structured rehab program (lifestyle education,&#xD;
      resistance exercise and cycling during HD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control: Standard care (baseline exercise counseling)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes measured at baseline, 12, 26 and 52 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: Will be performed on an intention to treat, available case basis with t-tests&#xD;
      or Mann Whitney U for continuous outcomes, as per data distribution and Chi square tests for&#xD;
      categorical outcomes. Mixed effects modeling will account for repeated outcome measures over&#xD;
      time. Poisson regression will be performed for hospitalization analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated Outcomes: Mean symptom burden severity score will decrease by 20% from baseline&#xD;
      in the intervention group. Due to sustained physical activity in the intervention group,&#xD;
      symptom burden will remain lower in this group at 6 and 12 months. In contrast, the control&#xD;
      group will see no improvement in symptom burden from baseline.&#xD;
