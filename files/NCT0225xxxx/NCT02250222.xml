  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated is developing LGD-6972, a novel, orally-bioavailable&#xD;
      addition to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus. The mechanism of action of LGD-6972 is to reduce the excess liver glucose&#xD;
      production characteristic of type 2 diabetes mellitus that is a major contributor to&#xD;
      hyperglycemia. This clinical trial will evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating&#xD;
      doses LGD-6972 administered daily over 2 weeks in both healthy subjects and subjects with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is to be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential, multiple oral dose&#xD;
      study conducted in normoglycemic healthy subjects (NHS) (Part 1) and subjects with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who are treated with monotherapy metformin (a stable dose at&#xD;
      randomization) along with diet and exercise (Part 2). Subjects with T2DM who are not on a&#xD;
      stable dose of metformin but meet all other entry criteria may be enrolled in the study at&#xD;
      the discretion of the Investigator, but must undergo a stabilization period of at least 12&#xD;
      weeks before determining eligibility for the study. In Part 1, a single group of healthy&#xD;
      subjects will be dosed with repeated oral doses of 15 mg of LGD-6972 or placebo once daily&#xD;
      (QD) for 14 days. In Part 2, a maximum of 3 groups of subjects with T2DM will be dosed with 3&#xD;
      sequential, increasing doses of LGD-6972 (5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg) or placebo QD for 14 days.&#xD;
