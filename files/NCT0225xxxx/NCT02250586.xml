    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND: About 2.3 % of the adult population in Sweden is considered to be problem&#xD;
      gamblers, and it is estimated that only 5 % of them seek treatment. Problem gambling can have&#xD;
      devastating effects on the economy, health and relationship, both for the problem gambler and&#xD;
      their concerned significant other (CSO). No empirically supported program exists for the CSOs&#xD;
      of problem gamblers. Consequently, the aim of this study is to develop and evaluate a program&#xD;
      aimed at CSOs of treatment refusing problem gamblers. The program will be based on principles&#xD;
      from cognitive behavioral therapy and motivational interviewing. In order to benefit as many&#xD;
      CSOs as possible, the program will be delivered via the Internet with therapist support via&#xD;
      email and telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS/DESIGN: This will be a randomized wait-list controlled internet-delivered trial. A&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral-therapy program for the concerned significant others (CSOs) of problem&#xD;
      gamblers (PGs) will be developed and evaluated. The participants will work through 8 modules&#xD;
      over 10 weeks in a secure online environment, and receive support via text messages and over&#xD;
      telephone. 150 CSOs over 18 years of age will be included. Measures will be taken at baseline&#xD;
      3, 6 and 12 months. Primary outcomes concern gambling-related harm and motivating the PG to&#xD;
      seek treatment. Secondary outcomes are CSO's feelings of depression, anxiety, relationship&#xD;
      satisfaction and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS: The investigators hypothesize: 1) that the CBT-CSO group will lead to a reduction&#xD;
      in gambling related harm experienced by the CSO, 2) the CBT-CSO program will reduce the CSO's&#xD;
      anxiety and depressive feelings, 3) the CBT-CSO program will decrease the amount of time and&#xD;
      money the problem gambler spend on gambling, 4) the CBT-CSO program will increase the CSO's&#xD;
      relationship satisfaction with the problem gambler.&#xD;

    <description>The CBT-CSO program will be based on concepts from cognitive-behavioral therapy and motivational interviewing, and is specifically developed for use with CSOs of treatment refusing problem gamblers. The program resembles the community reinforcement and family training approach that has been successfully used with CSOs of substance abusers.&#xD;
The program will be given as guided self-help with guidance given via email and telephone. There are 8 modules, which all contain homework exercises and about 5-10 pages of text.</description>
