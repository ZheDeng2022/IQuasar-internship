    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-center, non-randomized, multiple-administrations study in males&#xD;
      and females, some of which are with acne.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve (12) subjects will be enrolled to receive a daily dose of topical FMX-101 minocycline&#xD;
      (4%) foam for sixteen consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will undergo screening procedures within 21 days prior to dosing, to assess his&#xD;
      eligibility to participate in the study, including a dermatological assessment of the acne&#xD;
      severity and distribution (for subjects with acne).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 11, 14, 16 and 17 blood will be drawn for PK An End-of Study/Safety&#xD;
      Follow-up visit will take place on 7-10 days after last dose, which will also include a&#xD;
      dermatological assessment of response to treatment&#xD;
