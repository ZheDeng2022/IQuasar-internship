      To obtain sufficient specimens and correlating clinical data from a well-controlled&#xD;
      prospective clinical trial collecting specimens from healthy subjects t on vitamin D assays,&#xD;
      and to establish a collection of specimens that will support future assay discovery and&#xD;
      validation efforts.&#xD;

      1. Obtain matched serum and plasma specimens collected from a minimum of 50 healthy&#xD;
           subjects in two geographic areas. Specimens will be used to determine a reference range&#xD;
           for a vitamin D assay, used as an aid in the assessment of vitamin D sufficiency in&#xD;
           adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Obtain serum specimens collected from a minimum of an additional 450 healthy subjects in&#xD;
           two geographic areas. Specimens will be used to determine a reference range for a&#xD;
           vitamin D assay, used as an aid in the assessment of vitamin D sufficiency in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To store any remaining specimens for use in future vitamin D assay development and to&#xD;
           evaluate as yet undetermined assays for the development of IVDs, including additional&#xD;
           vitamin D assays&#xD;
