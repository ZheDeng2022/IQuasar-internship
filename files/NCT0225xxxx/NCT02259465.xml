  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some carbohydrates, complex sugars, which are found in grains, fruit and vegetables, cannot&#xD;
      be digested by humans. When eaten they pass through the small bowel to the large bowel, or&#xD;
      colon. Some bacteria that live in the colon are able to digest these carbohydrates, and use&#xD;
      them as an energy source. This releases energy that humans can absorb, and may have other&#xD;
      effects on health as well. The process also releases gases such as hydrogen and methane into&#xD;
      the colon, which will eventually be released as flatulence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is some evidence in animals, and humans, that changing the carbohydrate content of the&#xD;
      diet may increase the numbers of bacteria in the colon that can use this energy source.&#xD;
      Recent work has looked at how changes in colon bacteria and carbohydrate in the diet affect&#xD;
      transit, the speed at which food and stool moves through the stomach and bowels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This undergraduate project will use techniques in Magnetic Resonance Imaging developed in&#xD;
      Nottingham to investigate how a prolonged change in dietary carbohydrate might affect speed&#xD;
      of transit through the bowel and gas production in the colon, and whether there is any immune&#xD;
      reaction to the carbohydrate from the bowel wall.&#xD;

      Oligofructose (OF) is a fructose- based oligosaccharide and defined in the European Union as&#xD;
      a dietary fibre. Enzymatically derived from the longer chain inulin in chicory, it is&#xD;
      commonly used in processed food to improve mouth feel in fat-free products. OF is poorly&#xD;
      digested and absorbed in the small bowel so passes to the colon where it is fermented by the&#xD;
      bacteria usually resident in the colon, termed the microbiota. This process produces gases&#xD;
      such as hydrogen and sometimes methane, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) which have a&#xD;
      variety of roles including nutrition to colonocytes, immunological effects and modulation of&#xD;
      intestinal motility. Its presence in the colon alters the composition of the microbiota, with&#xD;
      reported potential benefits to health, leading to its description as a 'prebiotic'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, however, such poorly digested carbohydrates grouped together by the term FODMAP&#xD;
      (fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols) have been proposed to exacerbate&#xD;
      symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) such as abdominal discomfort and bloating. Dietary&#xD;
      exclusion of foods containing FODMAPs, such as wheat, dairy and certain fruit and vegetables,&#xD;
      has been proposed as a treatment for IBS, with some evidence to support this. FODMAPs are&#xD;
      thought to induce symptoms either by drawing water into the small bowel by osmosis, or&#xD;
      through gaseous distension of the large bowel or a combination of these along with metabolite&#xD;
      effects on motility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Nottingham GI MRI group has been at the forefront of elucidating the actual effects of&#xD;
      FODMAPs on gastrointestinal (GI) physiology. We have published techniques to measure small&#xD;
      bowel water content, colonic volume and gas volume and whole gut transit time. We have&#xD;
      recently demonstrated that a single, large (40g) dose of inulin leads to an increase in&#xD;
      colonic volume, mainly through an increase in colonic gas. Such a dose is beyond the usual&#xD;
      range of dietary variation, however. Last year we piloted a model more similar to dietary&#xD;
      practice. Participants supplemented their usual diet with 5g OF twice daily for a week. The&#xD;
      most striking result was an 18% increase in fasting colonic volume. This could not be&#xD;
      explained by changes in colonic gas and may represent proliferation, and increased mass, of&#xD;
      the microbiota. That study was an open label, uncontrolled case series so we now wish to test&#xD;
      the hypothesis in a double-blind, randomised controlled trial. For explanatory purposes we&#xD;
      will also measure whole gut transit, colonic gas volume and hydrogen and methane expired in&#xD;
      the breath. For exploratory purposes we will also collect stool and urine samples to allow&#xD;
      assessment of the effect on microbiota and their metabolic output.&#xD;
