    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether a combination of two pills commonly used to&#xD;
      treat outpatient diabetes called metformin and sitagliptin (januvia) could provide successful&#xD;
      control of blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes during hospitalization for the&#xD;
      treatment of a general medical condition. Both metformin and sitagliptin are currently&#xD;
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but little&#xD;
      experience exists for their use in hospitalized patients. The current standard practice is to&#xD;
      use insulin injections to control blood sugar in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
      This study will compare the use of metformin tablets twice per day along with sitagliptin&#xD;
      tablets once per day with daily insulin injections in patients with type 2 diabetes during&#xD;
      hospitalization, and will study how well the blood sugar levels are controlled.&#xD;

      We propose a trial to evaluate whether in-hospital glycemic control, as measured by mean&#xD;
      daily glucose concentration and frequency of hypoglycemic events, is different between&#xD;
      treatment with metformin and sitagliptin combination and treatment with glargine insulin once&#xD;
      daily and rapid-acting insulin analog with meals in patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
      Hyperglycemia is associated with increased mortality, prolonged hospitalization and increased&#xD;
      complications such as infection (1). Consensus guidelines recommend long-acting basal insulin&#xD;
      and meal-time bolus insulin therapy for inpatient blood glucose management. These basal bolus&#xD;
      regimens are labor intensive, require multiple injections each day, and can cause&#xD;
      hypoglycemia. A study at our institution of patients admitted to the hospital and treated&#xD;
      with our basal bolus insulin protocol found the incidence of hypoglycemia (blood glucose less&#xD;
      than 70 mg/dl) to be 20% of all patient stays (2). A strategy for inpatient blood glucose&#xD;
      management with less risk of hypoglycemia is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a trial of the use of two oral medications metformin and sitagliptin that lower&#xD;
      blood sugar without the risk of hypoglycemia. Metformin is first-line therapy for outpatient&#xD;
      management of type 2 diabetes. It has long-standing evidence of safety and efficacy. It&#xD;
      decreases hepatic glucose production and increases insulin-mediated glucose utilization in&#xD;
      the muscle and the liver. A Cochrane Review of 29 trials of metformin as monotherapy compared&#xD;
      with other oral agents, insulin, diet, or placebo showed a reduction in cardiovascular events&#xD;
      and all-cause mortality with metformin (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sitagliptin is a Dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor approved by the FDA as monotherapy&#xD;
      or in combination with metformin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Metformin and&#xD;
      sitagliptin are active within 24 hours of initiation and do not cause hypoglycemia.&#xD;
      Sitagliptin works by slowing the inactivation of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). GLP-1&#xD;
      stimulates glucose dependent secretion of endogenous insulin with meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent preliminary study supports the use of sitagliptin for inpatient glucose management.&#xD;
      This trial included 90 patients with type 2 diabetes admitted to general medicine and surgery&#xD;
      services. It randomized patients to one of three groups: sitagliptin alone, sitagliptin plus&#xD;
      long-acting insulin (glargine), or a basal bolus insulin regimen. The study selected for&#xD;
      patients with mild to moderate diabetes by including only patients with diabetes controlled&#xD;
      by diet alone, any combination of oral antidiabetic agents, or a total daily insulin dose ≤&#xD;
      0.4 units/kg prior to admission. Patients were eligible if their blood sugar was 140 - 400&#xD;
      mg/dl. Patients in all three groups received supplemental (correction) doses of rapid-acting&#xD;
      insulin before meals and bedtime for blood glucose &gt;140 mg/dL. Glycemic control improved&#xD;
      similarly in all treatment groups, but 100% of the patients in the sitagliptin alone group&#xD;
      required one or more injections of rapid-acting insulin to correct hyperglycemia (4). This&#xD;
      result suggests that sitagliptin alone is insufficient therapy for treating hyperglycemia in&#xD;
      this population. We will recruit a similar population of patients, and we will add metformin&#xD;
      for improved blood sugar control. Our sitagliptin and metformin group will not receive&#xD;
      supplemental doses of rapid-acting insulin as the purpose of this trial is to evaluate a&#xD;
      regimen without the risk of hypoglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metformin is safe in patients with adequate renal function. The current prescribing&#xD;
      information for metformin is that its use is permitted with a serum creatinine ≤ 1.4 mg/dL in&#xD;
      women and ≤ 1.5 mg/dL in men which is equivalent to a GFR ≥ 60 ml/min (5). It is excreted by&#xD;
      the kidneys and therefore can potentially accumulate in patients with renal failure.&#xD;
      Metformin works by inhibiting gluconeogenesis-a process that utilizes lactic acid to produce&#xD;
      glucose. Thus, with accumulation of this medication, it could predispose patients to lactic&#xD;
      acidosis. The incidence of lactic acidosis with metformin is extremely low. A systematic&#xD;
      review of 347 randomized trials and prospective cohort studies representing 70,490&#xD;
      patient-years of metformin use and 55,451 patient-years in the non-metformin group revealed&#xD;
      no cases of lactic acidosis. Almost half of the studies allowed inclusion of patients with a&#xD;
      serum creatinine above 1.5 mg/dL, and 97% of the studies allowed inclusion of patients with&#xD;
      at least one contraindication to metformin therapy (6). Another trial evaluated the risk of&#xD;
      lactic acidosis with metformin in 393 patients with renal insufficiency, with serum&#xD;
      creatinine levels of 1.5 to 2.5 mg/dl (mean level 1.8 mg/dl) and found no cases of lactic&#xD;
      acidosis over four years of the trial duration (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most cases of lactic acidosis in patients taking metformin have been associated with shock or&#xD;
      other tissue hypoxia. Elevated lactate in these patients may not be related to metformin.&#xD;
      This is supported by the fact that lactic acidosis occurs as frequently in metformin users as&#xD;
      users of other anti-diabetes medications (8). Also, metformin levels do not correlate with&#xD;
      lactate levels or mortality suggesting that the underlying disease is more likely the cause&#xD;
      of the acidosis than metformin (9). However this theoretical concern for an exceedingly rare&#xD;
      complication has excluded metformin from use in hospitalized patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recognition of the rarity of lactic acidosis among users of metformin with renal&#xD;
      insufficiency has changed recommendations to allow for its use in patients with mild to&#xD;
      moderate renal insufficiency. Current guidelines use an estimated GFR (eGFR) which is a more&#xD;
      accurate approximation of renal function than serum creatinine. The current recommendation of&#xD;
      the American Diabetes Association states that metformin can be used at full doses (2000&#xD;
      mg/day) as long as eGFR &gt; 45 ml/min and serum creatinine is monitored. If the eGFR is &lt;&#xD;
      45ml/min, then a maximal dose of 1000 mg/day is advised, with serum creatinine monitoring.&#xD;
      Metformin should not be used if the eGFR is &lt; 30 ml/min (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The American College of Radiology has recently updated their guidelines for the use of&#xD;
      metformin in patients receiving IV contrast media (11). A prior guideline recommended holding&#xD;
      metformin for 4 days surrounding IV contrast administration to evaluate for contrast-induced&#xD;
      acute kidney injury. This guideline contributed to the practice of discontinuing metformin&#xD;
      during hospitalization due to the commonness of radiology studies using IV contrast. There is&#xD;
      no drug interaction between metformin and contrast media nor is there any effect of metformin&#xD;
      on renal function. Given the risk of contrast-induced acute kidney injury is very low in&#xD;
      patients with normal renal function and no co-morbidities, the revised (2013) American&#xD;
      College of Radiology guidelines recommend that metformin can be continued without the need to&#xD;
      evaluate renal function following contrast media. In the presence of co-morbidities that&#xD;
      increase the risk for developing acidosis (liver dysfunction, alcohol abuse, heart failure,&#xD;
      myocardial or peripheral muscle ischemia, sepsis or severe infection), the new guidelines&#xD;
      recommend holding metformin for two days after IV contrast administration. Our study will&#xD;
      only include patients without these co-morbidities and with normal renal function (eGFR &gt; 60&#xD;
      ml/min). All subjects will have serum creatinine measured daily, and metformin will be&#xD;
      discontinued in the event of acute kidney injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since metformin is safe and effective for glucose management in patients with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      and normal renal function, we propose its continuation during hospitalization. This study&#xD;
      will include adult patients with type 2 diabetes currently treated with metformin alone or in&#xD;
      combination with other anti-diabetic agents including low dose insulin. All subjects will&#xD;
      have normal renal function (eGFR&gt;60 ml/min) and no comorbidities that increase the risk for&#xD;
      acidosis. This prospective, randomized controlled trial will compare metformin and&#xD;
      sitagliptin (which cannot cause hypoglycemia) to usual insulin therapy, which is known to&#xD;
      cause hypoglycemia. This study has possible implications for improving the safety of therapy&#xD;
      for hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
