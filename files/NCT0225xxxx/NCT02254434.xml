      This study evaluates pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag 50 mg after the oral administration in&#xD;
      Mexican healthy volunteers under fasting conditions. The study will be an open label, single&#xD;
      dose study with 26 subjects planned to be enrolled. Healthy subjects (male and female) aged&#xD;
      between 18 - 50 years of age (inclusive) and a Body Mass Index within the range of 18-27.0&#xD;
      kg/meter (m)^2 (inclusive) were enrolled according to Quetelet. REVOLADE is a registered&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects' participation must be voluntary according to the General Health Law and an&#xD;
             informed consent form must be obtained for each subject before their participation.&#xD;
             Compliance to HelsinkiÂ´s Declaration, its Japan Review and good clinical practice&#xD;
             (GCP) should be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mexican male and female healthy volunteers with 18 to 50 years old will be included. A&#xD;
             female subject is eligible to participate if she is of, Non-childbearing potential&#xD;
             defined as pre menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy&#xD;
             (for this definition, &quot;documented&quot; refers to the outcome of the&#xD;
             investigator's/designee's review of the subject's medical history for study&#xD;
             eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's&#xD;
             medical records]; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (in&#xD;
             questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone [FSH]&#xD;
             &gt; 40 milliinternational units per milliliter (MlU/ml) and estradiol &lt; 40 picogram per&#xD;
             milliliter [pg/ml] [&lt;147 picomole per liter (pmol/L)] is confirmatory). Females on&#xD;
             hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be&#xD;
             required to use one of the contraception methods as described by the&#xD;
             Investigator/designee, if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise,&#xD;
             they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to&#xD;
             study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the&#xD;
             cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage&#xD;
             of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of&#xD;
             HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method). Child-bearing potential&#xD;
             with negative pregnancy test as determined by (serum or urine) human chorionic&#xD;
             gonadotropin (hCG) test at screening or prior to dosing abbr de ante meridiem (AN ).&#xD;
             Agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed by Investigator/designee for an&#xD;
             appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or investigator) prior&#xD;
             to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point.&#xD;
             Female subjects must agree to use contraception until seven days after the drug&#xD;
             administration. or has only same-sex partners, when this is her preferred and usual&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Volunteers should be healthy as determined by their medical evaluation done by the&#xD;
             physicians in the center and by their safety labs results done at a certified local&#xD;
             laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Variation limits within normal ranges on their screening visit are: Blood pressure&#xD;

             be +/- 10% from normal range, unless the principal investigator (PI) considers another&#xD;
             deviation as clinically non-significant. In that case, values should be documented in&#xD;
             the volunteer's clinical file as well as the decision to include the subject prior&#xD;
