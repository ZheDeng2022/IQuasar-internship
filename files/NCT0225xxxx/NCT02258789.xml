  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a lack of effective rehabilitation methods for visio-spatial neglect (VSN). By using&#xD;
      virtual technology, a new method (virtual reality, VR method) has been created which focuses&#xD;
      on stimulating attention networks: top down scanning training in a 3D game, combined with&#xD;
      intense visual, audio and tactile bottom-up stimulation, also including visuo-motor training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective. To evaluate clinical and functional improvement in stroke patients with VSN, as&#xD;
      well as before and after training with the new VR method Method:- An intense visio spatial&#xD;
      scanning training, enhanced by directed visual, audio and tactile stimulation cues and&#xD;
      feedback, also including visio-motor activation was designed in a VR game. The in-house&#xD;
      developed software was based on the Tetris game. The VR method consists of an interactive 3D&#xD;
      environment: a desktop computer, a monitor, 3D glasses and a force feedback interface. 15&#xD;
      patients with chronic (&gt;6 months) visio spatial neglect was included due to right-sided&#xD;
      ischemia. A VR neglect test battery including a Posner task were repeated three times during&#xD;
      a 5 weeks baseline before the training started (to establish the chronic state) and again&#xD;
      after 15 hours training (3x1 h for 5 weeks). Evaluation of a new method for training&#xD;
      attention after stroke causing visio spatial neglect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The method has been designed for home rehabilitation and is well suited for a tele-medicine&#xD;
      approach. It was built with standard components and is easy to manufacture at a low cost. The&#xD;
      idea is to give access to effective training, to make it available at the stroke unit with&#xD;
      the possibility for the patient to loan it it at discharge for home rehabilitation. The&#xD;
      concept of an all in one, easy-to-use device for testing, training and outcome evaluation&#xD;
      should be beneficial These preliminare results has been promising and indicates that the&#xD;
      RehAtt™ method could become an further developed into an effective and stimulating&#xD;
      intervention tool that would lower rehabilitation costs and reduce tiresome travelling to&#xD;
      hospitals for training.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A VR environment was used training (RehAtt) of post-stroke patients with neglect. Patients&#xD;
      played the VR games three times a week for five weeks, totally 15 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A neglect test battery five neglect tests was repeated three times during a five week&#xD;
      baseline to estabish a chronic state and reduce the test by test learning effect, then again&#xD;
      after the 5 weeks training period. The main outcome results were thereafter obtained by&#xD;
      comparing the 5 neglect tests: Star cancellation test, Baking Tray Task, Line Bisection,,&#xD;
      Extinction and Posner task - unified index by SPSS Repeated Measurement ANOVA from the 3&#xD;
      baseline visits to the results after intervention. The Catherine Bergego neglect scale was&#xD;
      used to assess activities in daily life before and after intervention as well as after six&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were included if they had a neglect that had persisted for more than six months&#xD;
      after a right sided ishemic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neglect was diagnosed if one or more of the four neglect subtests of the VR test battery was&#xD;
      below cut off (See below and Appendix for details).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria were severe visual impairment, severe medical illness, severe&#xD;
      depression or cognitive dysfunction (MMSE ≤ 23 points). All patients received oral and&#xD;
      written information with an informed and signed consent. The Umeå university ethics review&#xD;
      board (IRB) approved the study (2010-266-31M).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hardware consists of a standard PC, a video graphics card, a sound card, headphones and a&#xD;
      separate numeric keyboard to measure behavioural responses. In the VR test part, we used a&#xD;
      19&quot; CRT monitor and shutter glasses for stereoscopic vision. A 27&quot; monitor and 3D vision&#xD;
      glasses (Nvidia, Santa Clara, CA, USA) replaced them in the VR game part. A robotic pen&#xD;
      (Phantom omni haptic device, Sensable technologies, Wilmington, USA) was used as a pointer&#xD;
      using the right hand for assessment activities and the paretic left hand when playing the VR&#xD;
      game for intervention.&#xD;
